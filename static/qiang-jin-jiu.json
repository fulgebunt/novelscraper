    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 : Frigid Wind\u201cPrince1\u00a0of Jianxing, Shen Wei\u2019s regiment suffered a crushing defeat at the Chashi River in the Northeast. The Prefecture of Dunzhou\u2019s frontline fell into the enemy\u2019s hands, and thirty thousand soldiers were buried alive in the Chashi sinkhole. You were among them, but why were you the only one to escape unscathed?\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s eyes were glazed and unfocused. He did not answer.The interrogator pounded on the table and leaned forward to question him with a malicious glare. \u201cBecause Shen Wei was in covert communication with the Twelve Tribes of Biansha2\u00a0and had the intention to present the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo over to our external foes. You people want to collude with the enemies to breach the defenses of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0from within and without. That\u2019s why the Biansha Cavalry did not kill you. Am I right?\u201dShen Zechuan moved his dry, chapped lips. He struggled with some effort to listen to the interrogator\u2019s question, his Adam\u2019s apple throbbed as he answered haltingly. \u201cNo\u2026 no.\u201dThe interrogator snapped in a harsh voice, \u201cShen Wei immolated himself for fear of punishment. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards3\u00a0have already presented correspondence documents of their secret liaisons to the emperor. And yet, lad, you still dare to deny it. How truly pigheaded of you!\u201dShen Zechuan felt as if he was in a daze. He had no idea how long it had been since he had gotten some shuteye. It was as if he was being suspended by a single thread high up in the air, and if he so much let go from a moment of negligence, he would fall and smash himself into smithereens.The interrogator spread open the confession statement and took a few glances at it, \u201cYou said last night that you were able to emerge unscathed from the Chashi Sinkhole alive because your elder brother saved you. Is that right? \u201cThe scene that day vaguely materialized before Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes. They had been trapped so deep in the sinkhole that no matter what they did, they were unable to climb out, even with countless soldiers all crammed within. The pile of corpses under their feet grew thicker and thicker, but it was still not enough for them to reach the edge of the opening. The Biansha Cavalry surrounded the sinkhole, and the sound of flying arrows slicing through the frigid wind pierced through the night. Blood overflowed his calf as anguished wails and the gasps of those on their deathbed clung to his ears.Shen Zechuan began to hyperventilate and tremble in his seat. He lost control of himself and clutched his hair, unable to stop a strangled sob from escaping his throat.\u201cYou are lying.\u201dThe interrogator raised the confession statement and flicked it at Shen Zechuan.\u201cYour elder brother is Shen Zhouji, the eldest lawful son4\u00a0of the Prince of Jianxing. He abandoned thirty thousand soldiers before the Chashi Sinkhole and fled on the sly with his own private soldiers, but the Biansha Cavalry lassoed him with a rope and dragged him along the road by the Chashi River to his death. He was already dead by the time the Twelve Tribes of Biansha slaughtered those soldiers. There was no way he could save you. \u201cShen Zechuan\u2019s mind was in a whirl. The interrogator\u2019s voice sounded so far away, and all he could hear was the neverending wails.Where is the way out? Where are the reinforcements?\u00a0The dead pushed against the dead, those putrid, decaying flesh was pressing down on his hands.\u00a0Mu-ge\u00a0was shielding him above his head while he laid sprawled over the bloodied carcasses. He listened to\u00a0Mu-ge\u2019s rapid breathing, yet the cries that emerged from his throat were those of despair.\u201cYour bro is superhuman.\u201d Ji Mu struggled to smile, but tears were already streaming down his face. He continued in a sobbing voice, \u201cI\u2019m an impregnable fortress! I\u2019m hanging in there, it\u2019ll be fine. We hang in there, and the reinforcements will arrive soon. When that time comes, I\u2019ll return home with you to join Father and Mother. I still have to look for your sister-in-law\u2026\u201dThe interrogator banged the table and bellowed, \u201cCome clean with it!\u201dShen Zechuan began to struggle. He looked as if he wanted to break free from some invisible shackles, but the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0swarmed over and pinned him down against the table.\u201cYou are in our\u00a0imperial prison.5\u00a0I have not employed extreme torture on you on account of your young age. But since you don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for you, don\u2019t blame us for being ruthless. Men, apply the torture!\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s arms were tied with ropes before he was dragged to the open space in the room. Someone set a bench down with a \u201cclatter\u201d and bound his legs to it. A burly man beside him lifted his flogging rod, weighed it in his hands, and swung it down.\u201cI\u2019ll ask you one more time.\u201d The interrogator brushed aside the foam on the tea with the teacup\u2019s lid. It was only after he took a few languid sips that he asked, \u201cDid Shen Wei collude with the enemy to commit treason?\u201dShen Zechuan refused to relent. He shouted intermittently between the flogging. \u201cNo, no!\u201dThe interrogator set aside the teacup, \u201cThe Shen Clan would not be here today if you had used this fortitude on the battlefield. Continue to flog him!\u201dShen Zechuan was gradually crumbling. He hung his head and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cShen Wei never colluded with the enemies\u2026\u201d\u201cWe suffered a crushing defeat at the battle at the Chashi River all because Shen Wei recklessly fought the enemy head-on. After the defeat at the Chashi River, there was still a chance to redeem the situation at the Dunzhou frontline. Yet he withdrew his troops for no reason despite the great disparity of power between our troops and theirs. Because of this, the three cities of the Prefecture of Duanzhou fell into the enemy\u2019s hands. Ten of thousands of commoners in those cities lost their lives to the Biansha machetes.\u201d At this point, the interrogator let out a long sigh and continued hatefully. \u201cIt was a bloodbath in the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo. Shen Wei led his troops and withdrew south. The battle in the Prefecture of Dengzhou was the fishiest of all! The Qidong Chijun Commandery Garrison had already crossed Tianfei Watchtower to provide assistance, but he forsook the strategy of a pincer attack and instead mobilized thousands of cavalry to escort his own family to the City of Dancheng. This resulted in the entire line of defense in the Prefecture of Dengzhou to collapse\u2014 Wasn\u2019t this all done intentionally? If it weren\u2019t for the Libei Armored Cavalry6\u00a0galloping for three straight nights across the River of Ice7, the Biansha Cavalry would have already arrived at the gates of\u00a0Qudu!\u201dShen Zechuan felt dizzy and he was drenched in cold sweat. The interrogator flung the confession at him in contempt, and it smashed into the back of his head.\u201cYou\u2019d rather be a dog than a man of Zhongbo. And this time, Shen Wei is a sinner of Dazhou.8\u00a0You still want to deny it? You have no choice but to plead guilty!\u201dShen Zechuan was in so much pain that half of his body was numbed. He sprawled on the bench, looking at that confession before his eyes. The ink writings on it were clear. Every character was like a humiliating lash of the whip on his face as it announced to everyone in the world:Shen Wei betrayed his country. He\u2019s not even worthy to be a dog.He had left the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo to overrun with bodies. No one had even gone to collect those corpses buried in the Chashi Sinkhole yet, because everyone in the cities of Dunzhou had been massacred.Shen Wei burned himself to his death, but this bloodstained debt had to be borne by someone alive. Shen Wei had a harem of wives and concubines along with numerous sons. But they all perished when the Biansha Cavalry invaded the Prefecture of Dunzhou. It was only because Shen Zechuan was of lowly birth and had been raised on the outside that he could escape unscathed.Shen Zechuan was dragged back to his cell, and his heels left behind trails of blood in its path. He faced the wall and gazed at that small, narrow window. The frigid wind howled, and the snow came pelting down. The pitch-black night stretched on without end.It was primal chaos in his head. Amidst the sound of the winds, his mind wandered back to the sinkhole.Ji Mu was dying. His breathing had grown labored. Blood dripped down his armor onto the back of Shen Zechuan\u2019s neck and quickly turned icy. The wails around him had vanished, leaving behind only the unendurable groans of pain and the bellows of the frigid, biting wind.Shen Zechuan was face-to-face with a dead man who was no longer recognizable. His legs were pinned under heavy human bodies while a shield was pressing painfully against his abdomen. All he could smell as he breathed was the thick stench of blood. He gritted his teeth as the tears trickled down his face, but he had to stop himself from crying out loud. Despairing, he stared down at this face that was trampled beyond recognition, but he could not make out if this was a soldier he had seen before.\u201cBro.\u201d Shen Zechuan sobbed softly. \u201cI, I\u2019m scared\u2026\u201dJi Mu\u2019s throat bobbed. He gently patted Shen Zechuan\u2019s head, \u201cIt\u2019s alright\u2026 we\u2019ll be fine.\u201dShen Zechuan heard the singing of the soldiers at death\u2019s door. The gale tore apart the sound of the song and sent tattered pieces of it fluttering away into this frigid night.\u201cBattle in the city south\u2026 Death at the north of the city wall\u2026 Left out in the open, unburied\u2026 Free for all the crows to feed.\u201d9\u201cBro.\u201d Shen Zechuan whispered beneath him. \u201cI\u2019ll carry you on my back\u2026 bro.\u201dJi Mu\u2019s body was like a distorted shield. He smiled and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cI can walk on my own.\u201d\u201cWere you struck by an arrow?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Ji Mu\u2019s tears had dried up. He said breezily, \u201c\u2026 Those Biansha baldies can\u2019t shoot for nuts.\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s fingers were soaking in flesh and blood. With some difficulty, he wiped his face, \u201cShiniang\u00a0made dumplings. Once we return home, we\u2019ll eat many bowls of it.\u201dJi Mu sighed, \u201c\u2026 Bro is a slow-eater. Don\u2019t\u2026 snatch.\u201dShen Zechuan gave a firm nod beneath him.The snow gradually blanketed Ji Mu\u2019s body. He seemed tired and sleepy; his voice was so, so small, and he did not even have the energy to move his fingers. The song was sung very slowly, and when it reached the line \u201cthe valiant cavalry perished in battle\u201d, Ji Mu closed his eyes.Shen Zechuan said, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ll also give bro my money, to marry sister-in-law\u2026\u201d\u201cBro.\u201d\u201cBro.\u201dJi Mu remained silent. It was as if he was tired of listening to his words and could not help but fall asleep.Shen Zechuan began to tremble all over. He forgot when the Biansha Cavalry left and how he climbed his way out. When he propped himself up and lifted himself out, there was only a dead silence amidst the heavy snow. The stacked corpses cushioned under his knees all looked like discarded burlap sacks.Shen Zechuan looked back and began to choke with sobs.Ji Mu\u2019s back had been pierced with such a dense cluster of arrows that his entire person had turned into a twisted hedgehog. So much of his blood had trickled down onto Shen Zechuan\u2019s back, but Shen Zechuan had never realized it.The sound of horse hooves came swiftly in pursuit like the looming thunder. Shen Zechuan suddenly gave a start as he jolted awake.He felt like retching, but then he realized that both of his wrists had been firmly bound, and there was a burlap sack filled with soil on his body.The sack became heavier and heavier as it weighed down on his chest. He could not even utter a sound. This was the technique of inflicting \u201cdeath by crushing with an earth-filled sack\u201d habitually used in prisons on prisoners whom they did not want to survive the murder attempt or leave a trace of an injury behind. If Shen Zechuan had not woken up earlier, he would have been but a mere corpse gone cold by daybreak.Someone wants to kill him!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 : Death by FloggingIt was gloomy inside the\u00a0Imperial Prison. Shen Zechuan\u2019s hands and legs felt cold. He was beginning to find it hard to breathe. He kept twisting his wrists, but the hemp rope was so tightly secured around him that his attempts were futile.The sack of earth was squashing down on his chest, making him feel as if he had been thrown into a deep pool. His ears were humming, and his breathing, disordered. It was so hard for him to continue breathing that it felt like he was drowning.Shen Zechuan turned his eyes to stare at the candlelight beyond the bars.Several\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0in the hall were drinking and shouting as they played the finger-guessing game. They were simply too occupied to look back at Shen Zechuan. The sack of soil nailed Shen Zechuan down onto a crudely made straw mat. Nausea, stemming from the suffocation, engulfed him like a surge of floodwater.His vision swam. Shen Zechuan raised his head high and gritted his teeth to move his legs. Both his legs had been flogged until they were near numb; he felt nothing when he raised them. He stepped on the left corner of the bed made up of wooden planks. It was already rotting from bug infestation; in fact, he had even damaged it a little by sitting down on it on his very first day here.His breathing grew labored.Shen Zechuan stepped on that corner and stomped down on it with all his strength. But his legs were so weak that his kick did not even make a sound. The bed plank did not budge even the slightest. Cold sweat streamed down in torrents until the clothes on his back were soaked through.He yearns to live.Frantic whimpers escaped from Shen Zechuan\u2019s throat. He bit down on his tongue until it bled and stomped down again on the bed plank.Ji Mu\u2019s brutalized and barely recognizable corpse was the horsewhip igniting his desire to live. Ji Mu\u2019s voice seemed to be still reverberating in his ears.He must live!Shen Zechuan struck that wooden plank furiously until he finally heard a \u201cthud\u201d. Half of the bed board collapsed, and his body fell over on his side. The sack of soil tumbled down after him. He threw himself onto the ground as if he had just broken through the water surface and sucked in big mouthfuls of air.The ground was icy cold. Shen Zechuan\u2019s injured legs would not heed his commands, so he propped himself up with his elbows. Sweat trickled down the bridge of his nose. It was cold in prison, but he felt as if his whole body was burning. It was so searing that his insides were boiling. Eventually, he could not help but lower his head to dry-heave.Shen Wei deserves to die.There were one hundred and twenty thousand military forces in Zhongbo, divided among the Six Prefectures to establish a defensive perimeter. After the defeat at Chashi River, the Biansha Cavalry invaded Dunzhou. Just as the interrogator had said, there was still a chance to redeem the situation. Shen Wei not only had a well-trained and powerful army; he also had ample army provision. There were also the garrison troops in the Three Cities of Duanzhou available for his deployment. Yet, he unexpectedly abandoned Duanzhou and shrank back like a coward to hide out in the Dunzhou Prince\u2019s Residence.His retreat was the prelude to the fall of Zhongbo. The Biansha Cavalry massacred the three cities of Duanzhou, and the morale of the garrison troops took a nosedive. They fled south in a panic. Everyone thought that Shen Wei would battle to the death with the Twelve Tribes of Biansha in Dunzhou. But he took to his heels yet again when he caught wind of the news of their arrival.The Zhongbo army retreated in defeat one battle after another, while the Biansha Cavalry was like a steel blade in its full glory perforating through the Six Prefectures\u2019 territories. They came spurring their horses on and traveled light into battle, relying solely on their spoils of war to pursue their way within eight hundred\u00a0li1\u00a0of\u00a0Qudu, the Imperial Capital City of Dazhou.If Shen Wei had implemented the scorched earth policy during his retreat and burned down the granaries in the city so that nothing was left behind for the enemies, then there would have been no way the Biansha Cavalry would advance this far. This was because they carried no army supplies with them and had to rely solely on the grains from the cities they had invaded to replenish their provisions. Once the grains in the city had been wiped out with fire, even the toughest Biansha Cavalry would have to go hungry.A starving soldier would have been unable to continue fighting. When the time comes, the Libei Armored Cavalry would have crossed the River of Ice to intercept the Biansha Twelve Tribes\u2019 retreat, while the Qidong Five Commandery Garrisons would, from the Tianfei Watchtower, seal off all their possible escape routes. Those machetes would then be trapped like turtles in a jar. They would never survive the winter.But Shen Wei did not do so.He did not just give up resisting; he also left all the granaries in the city to the Biansha Cavalry. The Biansha Cavalry relied on the Dazhou\u2019s provisions to carry out a massacre of Dazhou\u2019s cities. Thanks to Shen Wei, their horses were well-fed enough to herd the common folks and captured soldiers to the Chashi River, where they were all slaughtered by the Biansha Cavalry in one night.Shen Zechuan had a very close call with death.And now,\u00a0Qudu\u00a0wanted to settle accounts. It was obvious that Shen Wei\u2019s deployment orders, while he was still alive, were all sloppily made. It did indeed seem like he was colluding with the Biansha Twelve Tribes to launch an attack from within and without. Yet, Shen Wei\u2019s immolated himself due to fear of punishment and burned himself to death, destroying all the documents along with him. Even the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, who were effective and efficient in their duties, were now at their wits\u2019 end.The Emperor wanted to get to the bottom of the matter, so all they could do was to keep on interrogating the only remaining person who might be in the know, Shen Zechuan. But Shen Zechuan\u2019s biological mother was a dancer in Duanzhou. Shen Wei had too many sons, and Shen Zechuan was his eighth son born to a concubine.2\u00a0There was really no place for him in the clan going by his age or rank. So he had long been driven out by the Dunzhou Prince\u2019s Residence to Duanzhou to be raised without parental guidance.\u00a0Shen Wei himself probably did not even remember he still had this son.Someone wants to kill him.That was not exactly a secret. He had been sent here to be a scapegoat for his father. He was the last remaining member of the Shen Clan in Zhongbo, and the son was obliged to pay his father\u2019s debts. So once the interrogation in the\u00a0Imperial Prison\u00a0was concluded, the Emperor would surely use his life to offer as a sacrifice during the memorial for the thirty thousand soldiers who were killed at the Chashi River in Zhongbo\u2019s Dunzhou prefecture.Even so, it should not be through an assassination like this.Shen Zechuan wiped the corner of his lips with his thumb and turned his head to spit out the spittle of blood in his mouth.If Shen Wei had indeed conspired with their foreign enemies with the intention to commit treason, then Shen Zechuan would have to die sooner or later. Why make an unnecessary move to assassinate an insignificant bastard born of a concubine like him? There was still someone in the capital worried about the interrogation. If that was the case, then there must have been something shady about the defeat of Shen Wei\u2019s troops.Shen Zechuan knew nothing.He had a\u00a0shifu\u00a0in Duanzhou, and his brother, Ji Mu, was his\u00a0shifu\u2019s\u00a0only son. To him, Shen Wei was merely the Prince of Jianxing, who had nothing to do with him. He had absolutely no idea if Shen Wei had conspired with the enemies.But he must deny it.The ground that Shen Zechuan was sprawled on was so bone-chillingly cold that he was even more awake than he had been during the day. He was a felon the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0arrested on the orders of the imperial edict. All arrest warrants, writs of summons, and official rulings came directly from the top. It brought him directly from the hands of Xiao Jiming, the\u00a0Hereditary Prince3\u00a0of Libei, right to the\u00a0Imperial Prison, bypassing even the Joint Trial of the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices.4This was clearly an indication of the Emperor\u2019s unrelenting determination to never condone this and to get to the bottom of the matter. But, under this kind of situation, who would have the guts to make such a reckless move to silence him before the Emperor could personally interrogate him?The cold wind was still howling at the window. Shen Zechuan turned his eyes and stared at the wall in the dark. He did not dare to close them again.The weather was slightly cool the next day. Shen Zechuan was brought back to the hall again. A snowstorm raged outside. The interrogator who had been cold towards him the other day was now smiling as he served tea with both hands and waited with deference at the side of the classical-styled, wooden chair.There was an old, fair-faced, and beardless eunuch sitting on the seat. He was wearing the official hat of the eunuchs made of velvet for the wintry season, with in a gourd-patterned5\u00a0mandarin square6\u00a0on his robe. His cloak was still draped over him, and he was holding a precious, exquisite plum blossom hand warmer as he rested his mind. He listened to the movements, then opened his eyes to look at Shen Zechuan.\u201cGodfather.\u201d Ji Lei, who was acting on the imperial edict to interrogate Shen Zechuan, stooped over to say, \u201cThis is the surviving descendant of the Prince of Jianxing, Shen Wei.\u201dPan Rugui looked at Shen Zechuan and asked, \u201cHow did it come to this?\u201dJi Lei was aware that Pan Rugui was not asking him why Shen Zechuan had ended up all filthy and stinky, but why he had yet to pry the whys and wherefores out of Shen Zechuan.Ji Lei\u2019s forehead was drenched in sweat, but he did not dare to wipe it away. He maintained his bow and responded, \u201cThis lad is ignorant. He has been delirious ever since we brought him back from Zhongbo. We don\u2019t know who put him up to it, but he has been refusing to confess.\u201d\u201cA wanted felon His Majesty ordered to arrest.\u201d Pan Rugui did not accept the tea offered. \u201cA child of fifteen or sixteen of age who was sent to the famous\u00a0Imperial Prison\u00a0to be personally interrogated by you, His Excellency Ji. And yet you still can\u2019t even hand over a confession statement.\u201dCupping the teacup in his hands, Ji Lei said with a bitter smile, \u201cIt\u2019s precisely because of that I do not dare to employ the tortures without authorization. He was already suffering from a cold when he arrived. If he dies because we did not hold back on the torture, then this case of Shen Wei would end up as a cold case.\u201dPan Rugui scrutinized Shen Zechuan for a moment and said, \u201cWe are all our Master\u2019s dogs. There\u2019s no point in keeping a dog if its fangs are no longer sharp. I know you have your own difficulties, but this is all part of your duties. His Majesty wants to see him now. This is his way of showing understanding and consideration for the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. How could you still gripe about it?\u201dJi Lei hurriedly prostrated himself in obeisance and said, \u201cGodfather is right. This son has been duly castigated.\u201dPan Rugui gave a snort of acknowledgment and said, \u201cClean him up. He can\u2019t seek an audience with His Majesty with how filthy he looks.\u201dShen Zechuan was taken by the errand-runner to wash up and have the injuries on his thigh simply bandaged before he was given a set of clean cotton attire to put on. He was at their mercy as they ordered him about. He was too indisposed to walk; it even took him some effort to climb onto the horse carriage.Pan Rugui finally accepted Ji Lei\u2019s tea. He stared at Shen Zechuan\u2019s back and said, \u201cHe\u2019s really the last surviving member of the Shen Clan?\u201dJi Lei answered, \u201cThat\u2019s right. He is the only survivor from the Chashi Sinkhole. The\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0Xiao of Libei personally took him under arrest. All this while, he has been detained in the prisoner wagon of the Libei Armored Cavalry. No one has ever touched him on the way here. \u201cPan Rugui sipped his cold tea. After a long time, he gave a skin-deep smile and said, \u201cHereditary Prince\u00a0Xiao is a prudent man.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan got off the carriage and let the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0carry him along a long path. The heavy snow blew onto his face. The internal eunuch leading the way hurried along without uttering a word of nonsense.The junior eunuch waiting respectfully under the eaves came forth to receive Pan Rugui when the latter arrived before Mingli Hall. He removed the cloak for Pan Rugui, helped him change the outer layer of his robe, and then took over the hand warmer in Pan Rugui\u2019s hands. They had already announced his arrival inside. Pan Rugui kowtowed by the door and said, \u201cYour Majesty, this slave7\u00a0has brought the man.\u201dA short while later, a low and unhurried voice rang out, \u201cBring him in.\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s breathing hitched. They had already supported him in. There was incense burning inside, but it was not stifling hot. He listened to the sounds of intermittent coughs as he swept his gaze out of the corner of his eye and caught a glimpse of two feet inside the hall.Emperor Xiande was dressed in a dark navy blue common robe.8\u00a0He was skinny to the point of being bony, and his body was frail. Major and minor illnesses had never stopped plaguing him in the three years he had ascended to the throne. He sat on the throne, his rectangular face looking particularly gentle and delicate due to his anemic-looking complexion.\u201cJi Lei has been trying him for several days.\u201d Emperor Xiande glanced at Ji lei, who was kneeling at the back. \u201cHas a conclusion been reached?\u201dJi Lei kowtowed and said, \u201cTo reply His Majesty, this lad\u2019s words are incoherent and full of loopholes. Everything he has confessed these few days is contradictory and cannot be believed.\u201dEmperor Xiande said, \u201cPresent all those he has confessed to me.\u201dJi Lei took out the tidied-up confession statement from his bosom and handed it with both hands to Pan Rugui. Pan Rugui hurried forward again and respectfully presented it to Emperor Xiande.Emperor Xiande looked through it once. When he reached the part about Chashi Sinkhole, he covered his mouth and started coughing. He refused to let Pan Rugui wipe it for him; instead he wiped off the blood between his lips himself with a handkerchief. He said in a heavy voice, \u201cThirty thousand soldiers lost their lives at the sinkhole but not Shen Wei. This truly makes one\u2019s blood boils!\u201dShen Zechuan closed his eyes, and his chest began to pound. Sure enough, the next moment, he heard Emperor Xiande\u2019s orders.\u201cRaise your head!\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s breathing quickened. His palms on the ground that were propping himself up felt icy cold. He raised his head slowly, his eyes carefully landing on Emperor Xiande\u2019s boots.Emperor Xiande looked at him and asked, \u201cYou are Shen Wei\u2019s son and the only survivor of the Chashi Sinkhole. What do you have to say?\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s eyes reddened. His body trembled ever so slightly as he sobbed and said nothing.Without a change in expression, Emperor Xiande demanded, \u201cAnswer me!\u201dShen Zechuan suddenly raised his eyes. The tears trickled down along his cheeks. He raised his eyes for a fleeting moment, then kowtowed hard onto the ground. His shoulders trembled, and spasmodic sobs in his throat rose along with the trembling.\u201cYour Majesty\u2026 Your Majesty! My father is loyal to the country. He was too ashamed to face the country and the Elders of Zhongbo after the defeat of his troops. That\u2019s why he immolated himself to atone for it!\u201dEmperor Xiande rebuked, \u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting?! If he was that devoted to the country, why would he keep retreating?\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s voice was hoarse from his sobbing. \u201cMy father sent all his sons onto the battlefield. My eldest brother, Shen Zhouji, was tortured to death by those Biansha people who dragged him behind a horse along the Chashi public route! If it were not for his loyalty, how would he have been able to go to such an extent?\u201dEmperor Xiande said, \u201cHow dare you bring up the Chashi battle? Shen Zhouji fled before the battle. His crime is unpardonable!\u201dShen Zechuan looked up at Emperor Xiande with tears streaming from his eyes. He said in a raspy voice, \u201cThe battle at Chashi was a bloodbath. My eldest brother may be muddleheaded and incompetent, but he defended Chashi for three days. It was within these three days that the military intelligence of the war situation was delivered to Qidong and Libei. If it weren\u2019t for these three days\u2026\u201dHe was so choked with emotions that he could not continue.Emperor Xiande looked at the confession in his hand. The entire hall was silent except for the sounds of Shen Zechuan\u2019s sobs. Amidst this excruciatingly long silence, Shen Zechuan dug his fingernails into his flesh.Emperor Xiande suddenly gave a long sigh and asked, \u201cHas Shen Wei ever colluded with the enemies?\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s answer was resolute and decisive. \u201cNever.\u201dUnexpectedly, Emperor Xiande set down the confession and said in a voice that had abruptly turned cold, \u201cThis boy is cunning and harbors the intent to deceive the ruler. I must not allow you to live! Pan Rugui, drag him away and flog him to death at the Gates of Duancheng!\u201d\u201cThis slave obeys!\u201d Pan Rugui immediately received his orders and bowed to retreat.Shen Zechuan felt cold all over as if he had been doused with a basin of icy water. He suddenly put up a struggle, but the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0covered his mouth and swiftly dragged him out of Mingli Hall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 : RaptorPan Rugui strode towards the Gate of Duancheng. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0Commandants split into two rows flanking each side and stayed as silent as winter cicadas. Once Pan Rugui came to a halt and announced Emperor Xiande\u2019s verbal edict, the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0began their work.The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0gagged Shen Zechuan and swiftly wrapped him up in a thick cotton-padded garment before they made him lie face down on the ground.Pan Rugui leaned over in the cold wind to observe Shen Zechuan\u2019s state. He raised his fingers to cover his lips feebly and coughed a few times before he said softly, \u201cYou are so young, and yet you are so gutsy that you dare to put on such a melodramatic display before His Majesty. If you had just truthfully confessed Shen Wei\u2019s crime of treason, you might still have a slim shot at survival.\u201dShen Zechuan shut his eyes tightly. Cold sweat had already soaked through his clothes.Pan Rugui rose to his feet and said, \u201cStart flogging.\u201dThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0Commandants on both sides immediately shouted in unison, \u201cLet the rod fall!\u201d A thunderous roar followed right after. \u201cHit!\u201dBefore the words were fully out of their mouths, the rod wrapped in an iron sheet with barbs came whistling down on Shen Zechuan and dealt him a heavy blow.After three strikes, he heard another voice. \u201cHit him hard!\u201dThe pain of his flesh was like a searing fire blazing through his body. They hit Shen Zechuan until he could no longer move. All he could do was to clamp his teeth down tightly on the gag in his mouth. He was unable to swallow his blood in time, and its coppery and salty taste saturated his mouth. Shen Zechuan was still hanging on to his last breath as the dripping sweat stung his wide-open eyes.The sky was overcast, and the heavy snow fell like willow catkins.Flogging was not a job anyone could do. As the saying \u201cfaint at twenty strokes, lame at fifty\u201d suggested, there were many ways to flog a man. It was generally a family craft handed down through the generations and was no less easier to train than learning a trade elsewhere. Moreover, this job did not just require one to have good martial arts skills, but also a discerning eye. These floggers had been doing this for so long that all they had to do is to look at the expressions of these Great Eunuchs from the\u00a0Ceremonial Directorate1\u00a0to know who should receive superficial wounds but serious internal injuries, and vice versa.Emperor Xiande\u2019s decree today was death by flogging, and Pan Rugui did not seem to value him either. That meant there was no way an about-turn would happen; he was a man who had to die. So these\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0brought out their special skills; within fifty strokes, Shen Zechuan must die.Pan Rugui kept an eye on the timing and noticed that Shen Zechuan had already gone motionless with his head drooping. He raised his hand over the hand warmer and was about to give his instructions when he saw an umbrella floating towards them on the path. A beauty in royal garb stood underneath.The dark clouds on Pan Rugui\u2019s face dispersed in a flash and transformed into a smile. Although he did not personally step forward in a greeting, the quick-witted eunuch beside him had already gone over to offer her his arm in support.\u201cMy sincere respects to Third Missy. It\u2019s such a cold day. If Her Majesty the Empress Dowager has any instructions, you can just send someone to pass the message.\u201d Pan Rugui spoke as he took two steps closer.Hua Xiangyi raised her hand lightly to motion to the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0not to move. She was delicate and beautiful. All these years, the Empress Dowager had kept her by her side to nurture her. Her facial features resembled those of the Empress Dowager when the latter was young. Although she went by the address of the Third Missy of the Dicheng Hua Clan in\u00a0Qudu, everyone knew she was a distinguished lady of the palace. Even the Emperor doted on her like his own dear little sister.Hua Xiangyi said in a slow and soft voice. \u201cGonggong, is the one sprawled on the ground the son of Zhongbo Shen Clan, Shen Zechuan?\u201dPan Rugui moved in tandem with Hua Xiangyi\u2019s steps and replied, \u201cThat\u2019s the one. His Majesty has just issued the decree to flog him to death.\u201dHua Xiangyi said, \u201cHis Majesty was in a fit of anger earlier. If Shen Zechuan were to die, then we\u2019ll never get to the bottom of Shen Wei\u2019s treason. Her Majesty the Empress Dowager had arrived at Mingli Hall half a quarter2\u00a0ago. His Majesty heeded her advice and has since calmed down some.\u201dPan Rugui let out an \u201coh, my\u201d and said, \u201cHis Majesty always listens to Her Majesty the Empress Dowager\u2019s counsel. He was in such a terrible rage earlier that I did not dare to say a word even if I had a mind to.\u201dHua Xiangyi smiled at Pan Rugui and said, \u201cHis Majesty said to \u2018flog\u2019 him. Isn\u2019t that what you did?\u201dPan Rugui took a few more steps and smiled too. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I was in such a hurry earlier when I heard the word \u2018flog\u2019 and gave this lad a good beating. May I know how we should deal with him now? \u201cHua Xiangyi swept a glance at Shen Zechuan and said, \u201cBefore His Majesty\u2019s retrial, drag him back to the\u00a0Imperial Prison\u00a0first. The child\u2019s life is of utmost importance. I\u2019m counting on\u00a0Gonggong\u00a0to inform His Excellency Ji to take good care of him by all means.\u201d\u201cThat goes without saying.\u201d Pan Rugui said, \u201cHow would Ji Lei dare to turn a deaf ear to Third Missy\u2019s exhortations? The weather is cold, and the roads are slippery. Xiaofuzi, hold Third Missy steady.\u201dAs soon as Hua Xiangyi left, Pan Rugui turned back and said to the two rows of\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, \u201cHis Majesty said to flog. We are about done hitting this person. Drag him back. You\u2019ve heard Third Missy\u2019s words earlier. That\u2019s Her Majesty the Empress Dowager\u2019s wish. Return and inform Ji Lei that all the people involved in this case are immortals.3\u00a0If something were to happen to the lad under his watch\u2026\u201dPan Rugui coughed slowly.\u201cEven the Jade Emperor4\u00a0himself wouldn\u2019t be able to protect that head of his.\u201dXiaofuzi returned to help support Pan Rugui by the arm. The long and wide stretch of road was empty. He whispered, \u201cForefather,5\u00a0we let him go just like this. Will His Majesty the Emperor really not blame us later?\u201dPan Rugui stepped on the snow and said, \u201cHis Majesty knows deep down that we can\u2019t be faulted for this.\u201dHe walked a few steps. Snowflakes squeezed their way into his fur collar.\u201cA promise is worth a thousand ounces of gold. A sovereign fears backpedaling on his words the most. His Majesty suffered another bout of serious illness due to the invasion of the Biansha Twelve Tribes. These days, he has been considering conferring a princess title on Third Missy to please Her Majesty the Empress Dowager. At this point in time, His Majesty will have to acquiesce even if Her Majesty the Empress Dowager were to make other demands of him, let alone to spare a man\u2019s life.\u201dAs he spoke, Pan Rugui inclined his head to look at Xiaofuzi.\u201cWhen have you ever seen Her Majesty the Empress Dowager change her orders?\u201dRegardless of which case it was, the real master was the one who stood by his or her own words.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan was delirious with fever. One moment, he saw Ji Mu dying before him. The next moment, he saw himself while he was still living in Duanzhou.The wind of Duanzhou caressed its way past the banner.\u00a0Shiniang\u00a0raised the curtain to step out with a white porcelain bowl in her hand. It was filled with dumplings that had thin skins and a large portion of fillings.\u201cTell your bro to come home!\u201d\u00a0Shiniang\u00a0called out to him, \u201cHe can\u2019t even sit still for a moment. Get him to hurry back for his meal!\u201dShen Zechuan climbed over the corridor\u2019s railing, took a few steps over to his\u00a0shiniang, and bit the dumpling off the chopsticks before running off. The dumpling was so scalding that he kept huffing through his mouth. As he went out of the door, he saw his\u00a0shifu, Ji Gang, sitting on the stairs. Thus, he squatted beside him.Ji Gang was grinding a rock with his hands. He turned his head to harrumph at Shen Zechuan and said, \u201cSilly lad, how much is a dumpling worth? Look at how much of a rarity you treat it as! Go call your bro back. The three of us father and sons will go to Yuanyang Tavern for a big meal. \u201cShen Zechuan did not continue the conversation, because\u00a0shiniang\u00a0was already pulling at Ji Gang\u2019s ear. She said, \u201cTurning your nose up at dumplings, huh? How capable of you. Do you really have the money to get yourself another wife? Going over yourself with these two silly lads in tow, hm?!\u201dShen Zechuan laughed out loud. He leaped down the stairs and waved to his\u00a0shifu\u00a0and\u00a0shiniang\u00a0before he ran out to the alley to look for his brother, Ji Mu.It was snowing heavily along the way. Shen Zechuan could not find him. The more he walked, the further he went, and the colder he became.\u201cBro.\u201dShen Zechuan dashed all over the place, shouting.\u201cJi Mu! Let\u2019s go home for our meal!\u201dGradually, the sound of horse hooves surrounded him. The heavy snow obstructed his view. Shen Zechuan was deeply entrenched in the sound of horse hooves, yet he could see no one around. The sound of fighting erupted in his ears, and warm blood splattered over his face. There were stabs of pain in both of Shen Zechuan\u2019s legs as an overwhelming force pinned him down onto the ground.He saw the dead man close before him again. The rain of arrows whistled in the wind. The man on his back was heavy, and that sticky and warm liquid trickled down along his neck, along his cheeks.This time, he knew what it was.Shen Zechuan woke up trembling. He was drenched in sweat, and it was so freezing that he shivered uncontrollably. He sprawled over the bed plank as his eyes adjusted with some difficulty to the darkness.There were still people in the prison room. The errand-runner cleared away the filthy items and lit the oil lamp.Shen Zechuan felt parched. The errand-runner seemed aware of his thirst and poured a bowl of cold water for him before setting it on the bed plank. Waves of hot and cold washed over Shen Zechuan. Very slowly, he nudged the bowl over to himself, spilling half of the water in it.No one spoke in the prison. Shen Zechuan was the only one left after the errand-runner withdrew. He slipped in and out of consciousness. This night seemed to drag on endlessly. No matter how he waited, dawn never came.The errand-runner came again to change Shen Zechuan\u2019s medicine. He was already a lot more sober. Ji Lei looked at him beyond the bars and said in a cold voice, \u201cYou are one lucky bastard. A scourge truly never dies. Her Majesty the Empress Dowager spared your life. I suppose you don\u2019t know why.\u201dShen Zechuan lowered his head and said nothing.Ji Lei said, \u201cI know your\u00a0shifu\u00a0is Ji Gang, the fugitive Ji Gang of the\u00a0martial fraternity. I was fellow disciples with him twenty years ago. Together, we served as the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0in\u00a0Qudu. I\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t know this, but he was once a Third Grade6\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0Vice Commander. I\u2019m trained in that set of Ji Clan\u2019s Boxing Style too.\u201dShen Zechuan raised his head and looked at him.Ji Lei opened the door and waited for the errand-runner to leave. Once there was no one around, he sat down beside Shen Zechuan\u2019s bed.\u201cLater, he committed a crime. His offense was one where he would have to be beheaded for it. But the earlier Emperor was benevolent. In the end, he did not put him to death and simply exiled him beyond the Pass.\u201d Ji Lei propped up his knee and grinned at Shen Zechuan with his back to the light. \u201cYour\u00a0shifu\u2014has no capability to speak of. He\u2019s just a lucky loser. Guess how he survived? Through the glory of your\u00a0shiniang, Just like you today. You probably don\u2019t even know who your\u00a0shiniang\u00a0is. Let me tell you then, your\u00a0shiniang\u00a0is Hua Pingting.7\u00a0There are the eight cities of Cen\u2019nan in\u00a0Qudu. The Dicheng Hua Clan among them is the clan of the current Empress Dowager. So, it\u2019s all because of your\u00a0shiniang\u00a0that the Empress Dowager spared your life today.\u201dJi Lei lowered his head and whispered.\u201cBut who would have known that your\u00a0shiniang\u00a0had already died during the military upheaval? I\u2019m telling you. Ji Gang is a worthless wretch. His father died twenty years ago, and twenty years later, his wife and son died too. Are you aware of who the main culprit is? You know it deep down. The perpetrator is Shen Wei!\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s breathing hitched.\u201cShen Wei opened up the line of defense at Chashi River. The Biansha Cavalry invaded and ran rampant all over. The machete severed your\u00a0shiniang\u2019s throat. Everything that happened before she breathed her last could make Ji Gang\u2019s life a living hell.\u201d\u201cDuanzhou fell into the enemies\u2019 hands. You said it was your brother who saved you.\u201d Ji Lei leaned back, sized up the back of his hand, and said, \u201cJi Mu, huh? Ji Gang raised you and watched you grow up, so Ji Mu was your brother. He was Ji Gang\u2019s only son\u2014Ji Gang\u2019s only offspring, and the Ji Clan\u2019s only descendant. But because of Shen Wei and you, he died too. Pierced through the heart with ten of thousands of arrows. His remains were even left behind in the sinkhole, subjected to the humiliation of being trampled by the horses of the Biansha Cavalry. I wonder how Ji Gang would have felt if he was still alive and had to collect his son\u2019s body.\u201dShen Zechuan suddenly lifted his body. Ji Lei easily pushed him back down.\u201cShen Wei betrayed his country and colluded with the enemies. This is a debt you have to shoulder. You seek to live today, and countless ghosts of Zhongbo who have died unjust deaths wails. You fell asleep at night, slowly distinguishing who among the others in your dreams are your\u00a0shiniang, your\u00a0shifu! You are still alive, but living is already more of an agony than dying. Can you forgive Shen Wei? If you forgive Shen Wei and help to exonerate him, then you will let your\u00a0shifu\u00a0and his entire family down. No matter what, Ji Gang is the benefactor who has raised and nurtured you. How can you do unto him such a disloyal and unfilial act?\u201d\u201cBesides, even if you drag out your own feeble existence, there is no longer anyone else in this world who will empathize with you. Once you are in\u00a0Qudu, you are Shen Wei. The people are enraged now. Those who hate you to the core are more than one could count. You still have to die, anyway. Rather than dying a dubious death, why not speak frankly to His Majesty and come clean about Shen Wei\u2019s crimes? It would also comfort your\u00a0shifu\u2019s soul in Heaven.\u201dJi Lei suddenly stopped talking when he saw Shen Zechuan, who was pinned on the bed plank, smiling. The young man\u2019s deathly pale face took on a sinister, frosty turn.\u201cShen Wei did not collude with the enemies.\u201dShen Zechuan enunciated each word through clenched teeth.\u201cShen Wei never colluded with the enemies!\u201dJi Lei lifted Shen Zechuan and slammed him into the wall. A \u201cBANG\u201d rang out, and bits of earth and dust rained down from the friction. The impact caused Shen Zechuan to cough incessantly.\u201cThere are too many ways I can use to kill you.\u201d Ji Lei said, \u201cUnappreciative little bastard. You got lucky this time and managed to escape death by the skin of your teeth. And now you really think you can survive beyond today?\u201dTurning around, he dragged Shen Zechuan to the door of the cell and kicked it open before heading out.\u201cI\u2019m impartial in my duties and will obey the will of the Empress Dowager. But there are plenty of people in Dazhou who can do as they please with no regard for authority. Since you are so hopelessly foolish, then I\u2019ll accede to your wishes. You want someone to kill you\u2014that person is already here!\u201dThe city gates of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0suddenly opened wide, and a row of pitch-black heavy armored cavalry swiftly galloped in from beyond the gates, sounding like peals of thunder.Shen Zechuan was dragged along the path. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0scattered, and the packed crowd split into two to clear the way for the heavy armored cavalry.A Libei raptor hovered in the sky as the sounds of clanking armor drummed against his chest. The rumble of hooves drew nearer. Shen Zechuan opened his eyes and saw the leader of the heavy armored cavalry charging straight over.The steed under the heavy armor was like a ferocious beast, huffing out hot clouds of air as it galloped a few steps before them. It was reined in just as it was about to crash into them. Hooves rose high in the air. By the time it came to a stop, the man on the back of the steed had already turned around and dismounted.Ji Lei stepped forward and said aloud, \u201cXiao\u2026\u201dThe man did not even look at Ji Lei and headed right for Shen Zechuan. Shen Zechuan had only just moved his shackles when the man kicked Shen Zechuan right on the chest with lightning speed!The force of this kick was so powerful that Shen Zechuan did not even get the chance to steel himself for it. Blood splattered the moment he opened his mouth. His entire person went tumbling on the ground. For a moment there, he almost puked his guts out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 : Last DescendantBattle boots trampled over the accumulated snow and circled around Shen Zechuan before stopping at his side. The man used his toe to correct the position of Shen Zechuan\u2019s face, causing his boots to be smeared with bloodstains. The voice under his helmet was muffled as he asked, \u201cShen Wei\u2019s your old man?\u201dShen Zechuan could not stop the blood from gushing out through his clenched teeth. Even as he hastily used his hands, he could not cover it up either. He did not answer.The man looked down at him for a moment and said, \u201cI\u2019m asking you.\u201dWith blood in his mouth, Shen Zechuan lowered his head and uttered a \u201cyeah\u201d.Ji Lei availed himself to the opportunity and said from the side. \u201cHe\u2019s the eight son of Shen Wei. His name is Shen\u2026\u201dThe man lifted his arms and took off his helmet to reveal a young face. The gyrfalcon circling in the sky rode on the cold wind and landed on his shoulder, sending up a puff of scattered snow. He looked at Shen Zechuan as if he were looking at a pair of worn-out shoes. It was hard to tell if his gaze was one of disdain or loathing; it was as frigid as a blade.Shen Zechuan did not know him, but he recognized the Libei Armored Cavalry.Back then, Shen Wei had cut a sorry figure as he retreated to the West. When he arrived at Cizhou, it was already Zhongbo\u2019s last line of defense. The Libei Armored Cavalry headed down from north to south. The\u00a0Hereditary Prince, Xiao Jiming, braved the snow to spur his troops on for three days without rest, crossing the River of Ice1\u00a0straight to Cizhou. Who would have known that Shen Wei did not even manage to defend Cizhou, causing the Libei Armored Cavalry to end up besieged by the enemies? If it were not for Xiao Jiming having reinforcements in place, it would have turned out to be another brutal battle.After this battle, Libei came to hate the Zhongbo Shen Clan the most.This man was not Xiao Jiming. But since he could spur a horse on to\u00a0Qudu\u00a0with a raptor on his shoulder, then he must have been the Prince of Libei\u2019s youngest son and Xiao Jiming\u2019s younger brother\u2014Xiao Chiye.Ji Lei initially harbored the intention to instigate him, but he lost the courage to fan the flames when he saw the Deputy General, Zhao Hui, behind Xiao Chiye.Xiao Chiye threw his helmet to Zhao Hui in passing. The sides of his lips curled into a smile, and the earlier penetrating stare dissolved away like melting ice. His frivolous temperament instantly materialized. Even the armor on him looked out of place now.\u201cYour Excellency Ji.\u201d He put his arm around Ji Lei\u2019s shoulders.\u201d I\u2019ve kept you waiting.\u201dJi Lei exchanged glances with Xiao Chiye and laughed. He said, \u201cSecond Young Master, it has been two years since we last met, and you have become so distant!\u201dXiao Chiye pointed to the blade at the side of his waist and said, \u201cI\u2019m carrying a blade, so I\u2019m considered half a soldier.\u201dIt was only then Ji Lei seemed to notice it. He laughed and said, \u201cExcellent blade! Second Young Master came to His Majesty\u2019s rescue this time. It has been hard for you along the way. Let\u2019s have a drink tonight after you have sought an audience with the Emperor!\u201dXiao Chiye regretfully motioned Ji Lei to look at the Deputy General, Zhao Hui, behind him. He said, \u201cMy eldest brother has sent someone to watch me. How can we drink to our hearts\u2019 content like this? Once I\u2019ve taken a breather in a few days, I\u2019ll treat you.\u201dZhao Hui expressionlessly paid his obeisances to Ji Lei.Ji Lei smiled in response and said to Xiao Chiye. \u201cThen, go on first to the palace. The Guard of Honor is still waiting for you.\u201dBoth men chatted and laughed freely as they walked all the way to the palace. Zhao Hui followed behind them and cast a look at Shen Zechuan as he was leaving. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0at the side caught the hint and dragged Shen Zechuan back.Ji Lei watched as Xiao Chiye entered the palace. Once the men flanking him were his own men, he spat out a mouthful of saliva like a man down on his luck. The smile on his face disappeared, leaving only discontent behind.What he had been initially thinking was that since this hoodlum was usually impudent and audacious, it was only to be expected if he ended up killing a man. Who would expect this numbskull to be so crafty that he had actually handled this issue with such care? One kick, and he had let Shen Zechuan off just like that.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xiao Chiye entered the palace, and Zhao Hui handed him a handkerchief. He wiped his hands as he walked.Zhao Hui whispered. \u201cYoung Master\u2019s kick earlier was too risky. If the last survivor of that Shen dog died on the spot, the Empress Dowager would surely be displeased.\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s smile vanished, and gloominess shadowed his face. He had just withdrawn from the desert battlefield, and the murderous intent and malevolent aura pouring off him were so compelling that the eunuch leading the way before them did not dare to eavesdrop again.Xiao Chiye said coldly, \u201cMy intent was to kick him to death. Old Dog Shen allowed a bloodbath to happen in Zhongbo. We have been burying those soldiers in the Chashi Sinkhole for half a month, and we are still not done burying them. And now the Hua Clan wants to protect that old dog\u2019s remaining descendant for the sake of their personal relationship. How in the world could something go so perfectly according to wishes? Besides, my eldest brother has been carrying out raids for thousands of\u00a0li.2\u00a0After this battle, there is nothing else to bestow or confer him with. Our Libei is at the peak of its glory. It has long become a thorn in the Empress Dowager\u2019s side.\u201dZhao Hui said, \u201cThe\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0often says that the moon waxes only to wane.3\u00a0The reward from\u00a0Qudu\u00a0this time is most likely a Hongmen Banquet.4\u00a0Young Master, the main forces are stationed hundreds of\u00a0li\u00a0away from the capital, and the aristocratic clans\u2019 eyes and ears are everywhere in the city. At this point in time, we must not act impulsively.\u201dXiao Chiye threw the handkerchief back to Zhao Hui and said, \u201cGot it.\u201d\u201cIs Ah5\u00a0Ye here?\u201dEmperor Xiande fed the parrot.The feathered animal had been raised until it was impeccably wily. Imitating Emperor Xiande\u2019s words, it opened its beak and said, \u201cA-Ye is here! A-Ye is here! A-Ye pays his obeisances to Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Long live! Long live! Long live Your Majesty!\u201dWith the feed in his hands, Xiao Jiming answered, \u201cHe should be here now.\u201d\u201cTwo years, huh.\u201d Emperor Xiande teased the parrot. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him for two years. This lad takes after your father. He grows so fast. I\u2019m afraid he will be even taller than you when he\u2019s all grown.\u201dXiao Jiming said, \u201cHe has grown taller, but he\u2019s still a child at heart. All he does is to stir up trouble at home.\u201dEmperor Xiande was about to say something when his coughs started up again. Pan Rugui held out a cup of tea to him from the side. Emperor Xiande moistened his throat for a moment. Before he could continue his words, he heard the announcement of Xiao Chiye\u2019s arrival outside.\u201cCome in.\u201d Emperor Xiande sat back on the chair and put up an arm. \u201cCome in and let me take a look at you.\u201dThe eunuch carefully lifted the curtain, and Xiao Chiye strode across the door and entered. With an air of coldness around him, he kneeled at the bottom and kowtowed to Emperor Xiande to pay his obeisances.With a smile. Emperor Xiande said, \u201cWhat a fine lad, looking all mighty in your armor. I heard that when the Biansha Twelve Tribes raided the food supplies route and relay station at the frontier the year before last, you showed your prowess and captured several people alive. Is that right?\u201dXiao Chiye laughed and said, \u201cYour Majesty thinks too highly of me. I\u2019ve indeed caught a few men, but they are all small fry.\u201dThe year before last, the Biansha Twelve Tribes carried out a raid on Guanbei\u2019s food supplies route. Leading the troops, Xiao Chiye made his debut in battle. In the end, he was thrashed up pretty badly by those Biansha baldies. It was Xiao Jiming who cleaned up the mess for him. This incident turned into a joke after news of it spread that year. Consequently, Xiao Chiye was reduced to an imbecile known to all.Seeing him thus, Emperor Xiande\u2019s voice softened, \u201cYou are young, and to be able to spur a horse on while brandishing a spear is already a skill in itself. However, your eldest brother is one of my Dazhou\u2019s Four Great Generals. I\u2019m sure he usually gives you some pointers on military tactics. Oh, Jiming. I can see that A-Ye is aware of the need to keep forging ahead. You mustn\u2019t be too stern on him.\u201dXiao Jiming voiced his compliance.Emperor Xiande added, \u201cThis time, Libei Armored Cavalry has performed meritorious service in coming to my rescue. Other than yesterday\u2019s major reward, I want to give A-Ye a small reward today as well.\u201dXiao Jiming rose to his feet to bow and say, \u201cIt\u2019s his blessing to receive His Majesty\u2019s favor. However, he has no merit and no contribution to speak of. How could he receive such a lofty reward?\u201dEmperor Xiande paused for a moment before saying, \u201cYou have launched a long-range raid over thousands of\u00a0li\u00a0and crossed the River of Ice overnight. Your merits are immeasurable. I\u2019ll even bestow a reward upon your wife, Lu Yizhi, this time, let alone A-Ye. A-Ye, Libei is a frontier of strategic importance. You are still young, so it\u2019s inevitable for you to find it dreary and boring if you remain there for long. Now, I\u2019m intending for you to come to\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to be a merry Commander-in-chief of the Imperial Regalia.6\u00a0Are you willing to?\u201dXiao Chiye had been remaining motionless with his head lowered. On hearing this, he raised his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m naturally willing if it is a reward bestowed by Your Majesty. All those in my family are warriors and generals. I can\u2019t even find a place to enjoy a song. If I remain in\u00a0Qudu, I\u2019d enjoy myself too much to even think of home or work.\u201dEmperor Xiande laughed aloud and said, \u201cWhat a lad. I\u2019m asking you to be a guard, but you just want to have fun! If your father were to hear of this, I\u2019m afraid you will not be able to escape another beating.\u201dThe atmosphere in the hall relaxed. Emperor Xiande retained both brothers to have a meal together with him. When it was time for them to withdraw, Emperor Xiande asked, \u201cI heard that Qidong had sent someone over too. Who is it?\u201dXiao Jiming replied, \u201cIt\u2019s Lu Guangbai from the Bianjun Commandery.\u201dEmperor Xiande seemed to be a little tired. Leaning against his chair, he waved his hand and said, \u201cTell him to come tomorrow.\u201dXiao Chiye followed Xiao Jiming out. The brothers had not walked far when they saw a man kneeling on the verandah. Pan Rugui approached and leaned forward to say with a beam on his face, \u201cGeneral Lu, General Lu!\u201dLu Guangbai opened his eyes and said wearily, \u201cPan\u00a0Gonggong.\u201dPan Rugui said, \u201cYou can stop kneeling. His Majesty the Emperor is tired today. He can only see you tomorrow.\u201dThe reticent Lu Guangbai nodded his head and rose to his feet to head out with the Xiao Clan brothers. It was only after they stepped out of the palace gates and mounted their horses that Xiao Jiming asked, \u201cWhy do you keep kneeling?\u201dLu Guangbai said, \u201cHis Majesty does not want to see me.\u201dBoth men went silent for a moment, knowing full well the reason for this. But Lu Guangbai did not feel bitter about it. He looked sideways at Xiao Chiye and asked, \u201cDid His Majesty reward you?\u201dXiao Chiye held the reins and answered, \u201cHe\u2019s keeping me on a leash.\u201dLu Guangbai reached out to pat the back of Xiao Chiye\u2019s shoulders and said, \u201cHow is this putting a leash on you? The ones he\u2019s keeping a leash on are your eldest brother and your father.\u201dXiao Chiye listened to the sound of the horse\u2019s hooves for a while before he said, \u201cHis Majesty mentioned my eldest sister-in-law. I almost broke out in a cold sweat then.\u201dLu Guangbai and Xiao Jiming burst out laughing together. Lu Guangbai asked, \u201cAre His Highness and Yizhi well?\u201dXiao Jiming nodded. With his cloak wrapped around his court attire, and with his armor removed, he was not as young and valiant like Xiao Chiye. Yet, he had a presence that inexplicably commanded attention. He said, \u201cThey are both well. My father is still concerned about the Old General\u2019s leg injury. This time, he specially instructed me to bring the medicinal plaster7\u00a0he usually uses. Yizhi is fine too. It\u2019s just that she has been missing all of you very much ever since she\u2019s with child. She wrote many letters; I\u2019ve brought them too. You can read them when you come over to the residence later.\u201dLu Guangbai pulled the reins uneasily and said, \u201cEveryone in the family is a warrior; there\u2019s no mother or sister-in-law who could go over to accompany her. It\u2019s freezing cold during winter in Libei. I\u2019ve been worrying ever since I heard of the news when I led the troops out of the Bianjun Commandery.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Xiao Chiye turned his head as well and said, \u201cIt\u2019s so dangerous in Cizhou. Brother is now a caged man and told me not to write home so as not to worry sister-in-law. The battle broke out too suddenly. It was only when he left home that brother and sister-in-law found out about the pregnancy.\u201dXiao Jiming has always been able to show restraint. He merely said, \u201cFather is keeping watch at home this time to protect Yizhi. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll not go anywhere else once I return home after the new year.\u201d8Lu Guangbai sighed and said, \u201cIn recent years, Libei has been caught in the heart of the storm. Every time we dispatch troops, we have to think twice. This time, we can only hate Shen Wei for shrinking back without putting up a fight and leaving us with such a rotten mess. When my troops passed the Chashi Sinkhole, the blood was all over the horses\u2019 hooves. He could not escape the death penalty, so he immolated himself first. But there\u2019s indeed something odd about this matter. Jiming, you captured his son and had him sent to the capital. Did you notice anything?\u201dXiao Jiming gathered his cloak in the wind and said, \u201cShen Wei has been one to attach great importance to the distinction between those of\u00a0lawful and common\u00a0birth. This son of his is his eight son of\u00a0shu\u00a0birth. There\u2019s no one in his mother\u2019s family to back him, and so he was abandoned in Duanzhou to be raised there. It stands to reason that he has no access to inside information. There must be a reason His Majesty is so insistent.\u201dXiao Chiye put on his helmet and said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to quell the public wrath. His Majesty personally handed the military power for the Garrisons of the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo over to Shen Wei. Now that such a thing has happened, he has to kill someone as proof of his impartiality.\u201dHowever, the one with imperial sovereignty over Dazhou was not the Emperor, but the Empress Dowager, who held court in place of the Emperor behind a screen.9\u00a0Now that the situation was at a stalemate, everyone all had their eyes on this life of Shen Zechuan. If he pleaded guilty and died, then that would be all\u2019s well that ends well; if he did not die, then he would be doomed to be a thorn in the flesh. The Libei Xiao Clan was now at their peak of glory and splendor. Even Qidong Commander-in-chief of the Qi Clan had to give way to them. Xiao Jiming was the \u201cthe River of Ice Armored Cavalry\u201d among the Four Great Generals, and he was also the brother-in-law10\u00a0of Lu Guangbai of the Qidong Bianjun Commandery. To put it more explicitly, this was a man who could mobilize the Libei Armored Cavalry and rely on his wife\u2019s family to deploy the Bianjun Commandery Garrison troops.\u00a0Qudu\u00a0had no choice but to guard against him.\u201cHer Majesty is bent on preserving his life.\u201d Lu Guangbai pursed his thin lips. \u201cShe\u2019s gunning to raise a jackal in the future who can rightfully and legitimately recover Zhongbo and, at the same time, submissive enough to be at her beck and call. When the time comes, she can consolidate power from within, while reining in Libei from without. She will be a thorn in our side. Jiming, we must not let this lad live!\u201dThe gale on the street outside brought snow that felt like slicing knives as it scraped across their cheeks. The three men spoke no further. In this endless silence, Zhao Hui, who had been silent behind them, urged his horse on forward.\u201cYoung Master previously kicked him with eighty percent force right at his heart. His breathing was already weak, and his old wounds bled again when he fell to the ground.\u201d Zhao Hui pondered it over. \u201cYet, he did not die immediately.\u201dXiao Chiye lifted the horsewhip and said, \u201cHe has been on trial for so many days and was even flogged. He was already hanging on by his last breath. That kick of mine was to send him on his way to the Underworld. If he doesn\u2019t die after tonight, then I\u2019ll acknowledge that he\u2019s a tenacious one.\u201dHowever, Zhao Hui frowned and said, \u201cHe\u2019s skinny and frail, and he has yet to recover from his cold all this time. By all logic, he should have died a long time ago. Yet, he is still hanging on. There is undoubtedly something odd about it. The\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u2026\u201dXiao Jiming swept a glance at them out of the corners of his eyes, and both men shut their mouths. He gazed out at the road before them in the intense wind. After a moment\u2019s silence, he said, \u201cWhether he lives or not is all fated.\u201dThe wind howled, and the metal chimes under the eaves on both sides clanked against one another. The murderous aura among the snow dispersed. Sitting level atop the horse, Xiao Jiming calmly and unhurriedly hit the horse to spur it forward.Zhao Hui lowered his head and stooped over as he urged his horse on to catch up.The expression under Xiao Chiye\u2019s helmet was vague. Lu Guangbai punched him on the shoulder and said, \u201cHe\u2019s your eldest brother, after all.\u201dXiao Chiye seemed to smile as he murmured, \u201c\u2026 Fate, huh?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 : FrontlineThe medicinal decoction leaked through the corners of Shen Zechuan\u2019s lips and soaked through the front of his clothes. The physician was so anxious that he sweated profusely and kept wiping his temples and forehead.\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t swallow the medicine.\u201d The physician said, \u201cHe definitely can\u2019t make it through this!\u201dGe Qingqing held his blade and stood to look at Shen Zechuan for a moment before he asked, \u201cIs there nothing else you can do?\u201dThe physician\u2019s hands that were holding up the medicine bowl trembled, causing the spoon in it to clatter against the bowl. He kowtowed to Ge Qingqing with all his might and said, \u201cIt can\u2019t be done! He won\u2019t make it! Please prepare the straw mat1\u00a0as soon as possible.\u201dGe Qingqing looked to be in a predicament. He said, \u201cFeed him first.\u201d, then turned around to step out of the door. Ji Lei was standing just outside. Ge Qingqing paid his obeisances and said, \u201cYour Excellency, the physician said he won\u2019t make it.\u201dJi Lei crushed the peanut shell and blew away the powder. He asked, \u201cHas he breathed his last?\u201dGe Qingqing replied, \u201cHe\u2019s still hanging on to his last breath.\u201dWith his hands at his back, Ji Lei turned his head back to look at Ge Qingqing. \u201cKeep an eye on him. Before he dies, get him to sign the written confession.\u201dGe Qingqing nodded and watched Ji Lei leave. He stood in the courtyard for a moment, then said to the subordinate beside him, \u201cGo and call the errand-runner over.\u201dA little while later, a hunched errand-runner all wrapped in coarse linen came pushing a cart. The sky was dark by now, and the\u00a0Imperial Prison\u00a0was under tight security. Ge Qingqing raised a lantern to illuminate the way and motioned for the man to follow him in.The physician had already left. There was only an oil lamp lit in the room. Shen Zechuan lay on the bed with his face totally devoid of color. His hands and legs were as icy as those of a corpse.Ge Qingqing stepped aside and said to the errand-runner, \u201cUncle Ji\u2026 Here he is.\u201dThe errand runner slowly stripped away the bundle of coarse cloth to reveal a face destroyed by fire. He stared at Shen Zechuan, took two steps over, and stretched out a trembling hand to caress Shen Zechuan\u2019s hair. When he saw how skinny and bloodied all over Shen Zechuan was, he could not stop his tears from coursing down his old cheeks.\u201cChuan-er.\u201d2\u00a0Ji Gang\u2019s voice was hoarse as he called out, \u201cShifu\u00a0is here!\u201dGe Qingqing blew out the lantern and said, \u201cUncle Ji, don\u2019t be afraid. Ever since those from the prison knew that he was your disciple, they have been treating him with meticulous care. The previous interrogation looked like heavy torture, but it did not hurt his foundation. During the flogging, the brothers more or less went easy on him on your account. He won\u2019t be maimed even with twenty strikes. However, the eunuch from the palace overseeing the punishment has sharp, discerning eyes, so we didn\u2019t dare to be too slack. Fortunately, Third Missy Hua came in time. Otherwise, Pan\u00a0Gonggong\u00a0would have gotten suspicious.\u201dJi Gang\u2019s hair was already half-white. With his world-weary face shedding tears, he said, \u201cI, Ji Gang, will surely repay this kindness in the future!\u201dGe Qingqing hurriedly said, \u201cUncle Ji! How can you think this way?! What our brothers have repaid are the kindness and affection you have showered on us when you guided us and saved our lives in the past.\u201d With that, he sighed again. \u201cWho would have expected a Cheng Yaojin3\u00a0to come charging out of nowhere this suddenly? The Second Young Master of the Xiao Clan was really trying to kill him with that kick. Uncle Ji, can he still be saved?\u201dJi Gang felt Shen Zechuan\u2019s pulse and said with a forced smile, \u201cGood lad. He did well with the technique Ah-Mu4\u00a0taught him. It\u2019s still not at the point of no return yet. Don\u2019t be afraid, my son.\u00a0Shifu\u00a0is here!\u201dShen Zechuan had started following Ji Gang at the age of seven and trained martial arts under him together with Ji Mu. Each strike from Ji Clan\u2019s Boxing Style was tough and fierce at the outset. It had to be complemented by the Ji Clan\u2019s mental cultivation techniques. Those without a steadfast will could not practice it. Ji Gang was a heavy drinker when he was back at home. He taught the older one and forgot about the younger one. As the older brother, Ji Mu had to teach his younger brother a stance every time he learned one. No one would have expected Shen Zechuan to have mastered it pretty well over the years.Ge Qingqing bent over for a look and said, \u201cBut he\u2019s still young after all. I\u2019m afraid his body will be in bad shape after going through this. Uncle Ji, I\u2019ve sent someone to decoct the medicine the physician prescribed again. Please see if you can feed it to him.\u201dShen Zechuan was burning up so much his mouth felt parched.His whole body was hurting all over. It was as if he was lying on the main street of\u00a0Qudu, getting crushed by the horse carriages coming and going.The pain was like an endless inferno consuming Shen Zechuan\u2019s body. In the darkness, he dreamed of the heavy dancing snow, Ji Mu\u2019s blood, the cold of the sinkhole, and the kick he received before Xiao Chiye.Ji Lei was right. To remain alive now was to suffer. He received the flesh and blood Shen Wei gave him, and so he had to endure such punishments. He took over Shen Wei\u2019s sins and became the sinner the loyal souls of those who had died unjust deaths howled him out to be. By putting on these shackles, he would always have to shoulder this burden as he moved on.But he couldn\u2019t take it lying down!Someone suddenly pried his teeth apart, and a warm current flooded into his throat. The bitter taste of the medicine made Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes watered. Hearing a familiar call, he forced his eyes open.Ji Gang fed him medicine and wiped away Shen Zechuan\u2019s tears with his rough fingers. He whispered, \u201cChuan-er, it\u2019s\u00a0shifu!\u201dA sob formed in Shen Zechuan\u2019s throat, causing him to choke out the medicine along with his tears. He stretched out his fingers to hook the corner of Ji Gang\u2019s clothes and clenched his teeth, fearing this to be merely a dream he had made in the stupor of illness.Ji Gang\u2019s face was ugly. He turned his head slightly to avoid the light from the oil lamp and said, \u201cChuan-er, stop harboring the will to die! You\u2019re the only one\u00a0shifu\u00a0has left in this ignoble existence of his.\u201dShen Zechuan could not stop his tears from streaming down his cheeks right there and then. He averted his gaze to stare at the pitch-black roof and whispered, \u201cShifu\u2026\u201dHis eyes gradually focused amidst the whir of the wind and took on a hint of malevolence.\u201cI won\u2019t die.\u201d He said in a hoarse voice, \u201cShifu, I won\u2019t die.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8The next day, Emperor Xiande rewarded the Three Armies with a feast. Apart from Libei Armored Cavalry and Qidong Garrison Troops outside the city, the palace also hosted a banquet and led all the various ministers and officials to entertain the Commander-in-chief of the army.Having changed into his court attire, Xiao Chiye overshadowed the delicateness of the scholars around him as he took his seat. The embroidered lion beast set against a pattern of clouds5\u00a0on him radiated an air of intensity and awe. But his frivolousness reared its head when he sat down for a conversation.The civil officials engrossed in drinking kept stealing glances at him. As they said, a tiger father will not beget a dog for a son.6\u00a0But how was it that it was only the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0Xiao who took after his father?It was with tacit understanding they nitpicked at Xiao Chiye\u2019s every move and action. They could feel that sense of willfulness and frivolousness hitting them right in the face. He was a world of difference from Xiao Jiming, who was sitting upright in the seat of honor.\u201cDon\u2019t detach yourself from this all.\u201d Lu Guangbai sat beside him to urge him, \u201cSince His Majesty has rewarded you, he will surely call you up later.\u201dXiao Chiye caressed the walnut in his palm, looking a little out of it.Lu Guangbai turned his head to the side to look at him and said, \u201cYou went out drinking with others last night, huh.\u201d\u201cMake merry while you can.\u201d Xiao Chiye slacked in his seat. \u201cIf anyone dares to do a Xiang Zhuang\u2019s Sword Dance7\u00a0later, I\u2019ll do a Fan Kuai8\u00a0while in a state of inebriation. That would be the best of both worlds, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine too.\u201d Lu Guangbai poured wine. \u201cBut drinking is bad for your health. If you want to be a good commander-in-chief, then change this bad habit of yours.\u201d\u201cI was born at the wrong time.\u201d Xiao Chiye threw Lu Guangbai a walnut. \u201cI won\u2019t have the chance to play the hero now that the Four Generals seats are full. If you can no longer make it someday, remember to let me know in advance. It won\u2019t be too late for me to kick the habit then.\u201dLu Guangbai said, \u201cThen I\u2019m afraid you have to wait.\u201dBoth men laughed for a moment and drank up half of the wine. They listened as the topic of discussion at the banquet changed to the Zhongbo Shen Clan.Grasping the walnut in his hand, Lu Guangbai listened attentively for a moment and asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t they say last night that this person won\u2019t make it?\u201dBehind him, Zhao Hui responded in a hushed tone, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Didn\u2019t Young Master say that the kick was to send him on his way to the Underworld?\u201dXiao Chiye denied it. \u201cDid I say that?\u201d The other two looked at him in silence, prompting him to ask, \u201cWhat?\u201dLu Guangbai said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t die.\u201dZhao Hui said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t die.\u201dXiao Chiye exchanged glances with the other two for a moment and said, \u201cIt\u2019s none of my business he\u2019s a tough one. The King of Hell isn\u2019t my old man.\u201dLu Guangbai looked up and said, \u201cLet\u2019s see what His Majesty has in store for him. He\u2019s really one tough cookie.\u201dKneeling behind then, Zhao Hui lowered his head to stuff himself with food. He said offhandedly, \u201cSomeone must be helping him in secret.\u201d\u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t die, he\u2019ll be maimed.\u201d Xiao Chiye glanced coldly at the Hua Clan seat a short distance away. \u201cThe Empress Dowager is already advanced in age. All she can do now is to rack her brains trying to groom a stray dog.\u201d\u201cWhat a sin.\u201d Zhao Hui emotionlessly stuffed a spare rib into his mouth.Seeing that the atmosphere was satisfactory enough after three rounds of drinking, Emperor Xiande spoke, \u201cJiming.\u201dXiao Jiming paid his obeisances and stood by to take his orders.Looking as if he could not hold his wine, Emperor Xiande leaned against the Dragon Throne9\u00a0and said, \u201cWhen all is said and done, there is no conclusive evidence for Shen Wei\u2019s troops\u2019 defeat and whether he had colluded with the enemy. That Shen\u2026\u201dPan Rugui bent over and whispered, \u201cYour Majesty, it\u2019s Shen Zechuan.\u201dEmperor Xiande paused for a moment, but instead of continuing, he turned to the Empress Dowager and asked, \u201cWhat does Imperial Mother10\u00a0think?\u201dA solemn silence descended upon the banquet as the entire court of civil and military officials lowered their heads to listen.The Empress Dowager wore a\u00a0zaoluo11\u00a0headband with a depiction of a dragon dropping a pearl among golden clouds. A row of golden emerald leaf beads circled around the headdress with a dazzling array of big pearls hanging from it. She sat \u2013 poised and dignified \u2013 high up on her seat. Her neatly combed glossy hair was the color of frost. No one in the entire banquet hall dared to raise their head to look directly at her.The Empress Dowager said, \u201cOur morale suffered a blow in the battle of Zhongbo all because Shen Wei panicked and lost his presence of mind. But now that he had immolated himself due to fear of punishment, and his descendants have all died in battle, there\u2019s only this son of common birth left behind. It goes against benevolence and righteousness to eliminate his whole clan. There is no reason we can\u2019t let him live so that he will feel gratitude towards us.\u201dThe banquet hall was silent. Lu Guangbai suddenly spoke up. \u201cThis subject12\u00a0doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d He took three steps out of the file of officials to kneel in the hall and continued, \u201cHer Majesty is benevolent. But the battle of Zhongdu is different from past battles. Although there is no evidence that Shen Wei colluded with the enemy, he is, nevertheless, still suspected of it. This lad is his remaining descendant. If we let him live, I fear he will become a danger in our own backyard in the future.\u201dThe Empress Dowager looked at Lu Guangbai for a moment and said, \u201cThe Earl13\u00a0of Biansha has been stationed in the desert to defend it for decades, and he doesn\u2019t exactly emerge victorious every battle.\u201dLu Guangbai replied, \u201cAlthough my father is not invincible, no external enemies have ever been able to push deep into the territories of the Bianjun Commandery for decades.\u201dThe big pearls beside the Empress Dowager\u2019s ears swayed gently. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s precisely because of this that it\u2019s even more pertinent to teach him protocol and virtue so that he can understand the disastrous consequences of this war. It\u2019s easy to kill a man. The horses of the Biansha Cavalry stepped into Zhongbo and killed tens of thousands of Dazhou commoners. We have yet to seek redress for the humiliation of our Empire. What crime is there for a child to be guilty of?\u201d\u201cThis subject finds it inappropriate as well.\u201dThe Deputy Senior Grand Secretary of the Grand Secretariat,14\u00a0Hai Liangyi, who had remained quiet all this while, supported himself up from the table and kneeled down as well.\u201cHer Majesty is benevolent, but this is no trivial matter. Even if Shen Wei did not collude with the enemy, he still deserves to be beheaded after this battle. Moreover, this child has been tried and interrogated thrice, and his confession statement is all over the place. He insisted that Shen Wei did not collude with the enemy. But he\u2019s a son of common birth Shen Wei had raised elsewhere. If he had no idea that Shen Wei had colluded with the enemies, then how would he know for sure that he didn\u2019t? It can be seen that he is cunning by nature; he lacks credibility. Just as General Lu has said, if we keep the last descendant of the Shen Clan alive, he will one day become the scourge of trouble in our own backyard!\u201dInstead of being furious, the Empress Dowager said, \u201cSecretariat Elder15\u00a0Hai, please rise quickly.\u201dAfter Pan Rugui helped Hai Liangyi up, the Empress Dowager said, \u201cIt\u2019s as my dear ministers said. I\u2019ve16\u00a0been biased in my thinking. I\u2019ll leave the decision-making on this matter to the Emperor.\u201dUnder the watchful eyes of his ministers, Emperor Xiande coughed feebly. He accepted the handkerchief Pan Rugui handed him and covered his mouth. After a long silence, he finally spoke.\u201cWhat Imperial Mother has said is not without reason. The child is innocent. However, when all is said and done, Shen Wei\u2019s troops were still defeated, and he had indeed abandoned the city. On account that there is only this bloodline left in all nine generations of his clan, I\u2019ll give this child a chance to reflect on his sin and redeem himself. Ji Lei.\u201d\u201cThis subject is at your command.\u201d\u201cTake this child into custody at Zhao Zui Temple.17\u00a0Without my order, he cannot venture out!\u201dXiao Chiye threw the broken pieces of walnut onto the plate.Zhao Hui asked, \u201cYoung Master, aren\u2019t you eating?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cMaimed and useless. Who wants?\u201dZhao Hui\u2019s eyeballs followed the plate as it turned. He said in a lowered voice, \u201cIsn\u2019t this to the satisfaction of all? We didn\u2019t get what we wanted, neither did the others.\u201d\u201cCaging him in is still better than letting him out.\u201d Lu Guangbai returned to his seat and said.\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d Xiao Chiye pointed to himself. \u201cAm I not a caged man too?\u201dLu Guangbai and Zhao Hui said in unison. \u201cGood for you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 : ImprisonmentIt was a rare sunny day in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0the day Shen Zechuan entered Zhao Zui Temple. White snow covered the palace tiles, with green plums mirrored on vermillion walls. Sunlight shone through the eaves, casting slanting lines of yin and yang1\u00a0before his feet.He had just recovered from a bout of severe illness and was skinny to the point of being skeletal. At fifteen years of age, his past and old dreams were like ashes scattered clean by this biting cold north wind the moment he opened his eyes.Ge Qingqing went down the stairs first. He turned his head to look back at him and said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting late.\u201dShen Zechuan supported himself against the pillar and slowly made his way down the stairs. He was neither accustomed nor terrified to be exposed under the sun. The childishness of youth seemed to have been pulverized amidst that pallor of his face. Other than the fragility of illness, they could discern nothing else from his expression.Ji Lei was waiting at the entrance of Zhao Zui Temple with Xiaofuzi following beside him. Raising his head to look at this ancient temple, Xiaofuzi marveled, \u201cWhat a magnificent and queer temple. It really doesn\u2019t seem to be the place to imprison people.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know its past.\u201d Ji Lei said, \u201cZhao Zui Temple was originally a place for the imperial clan to offer incense. Lord Guangcheng\u2019s handwritten orders were even previously offered in worship inside. In its heyday, all the eminent monks in the world assembled here, and large-scale intellectual discourse was all the rage for a time.\u201d\u201cWhy haven\u2019t I heard any mention of it in recent years?\u201d Xiaofuzi sized up the temple gates. \u201cIt\u2019s rather dilapidated. There haven\u2019t been any repairs done on it for a long time, have it?\u201dJi Lei spent a moment composing himself and said, \u201cIt\u2019s been twenty years. The condemned Crown Prince instigated the Eight Great Training Divisions of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to plot a rebellion. After his troops\u2019 defeat, he retreated here and fought back like a cornered beast. In the end, blood splattered all over the Buddha statue as he slit his own throat to end his life. From then on, the former Emperor no longer set foot in his place. He stripped the temple of its name and renamed it Zhao Zui.\u201d\u201cOh man, twenty years.\u201d Xiaofuzi clutched his throat as if this was a surprising thing to him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even born yet! That was the time His Excellency Ji just joined the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, wasn\u2019t it?\u201dJi Lei did not answer him. He turned to the rear and rebuked. \u201cWhy is he not here yet?\u201dXiaofuzi was still circling around the \u201cZhao Zui\u201d stone tablet. When he was done, he asked Ji Lei, \u201cBut I\u2019ve never heard of anyone being locked up inside either?\u201dJi Lei seemed annoyed and said, \u201cThose imprisoned are all the secretariat ministers involved in the case of the condemned Crown Prince. The clans of the civil officials and military commanders involved were all executed. Those that remained are few and far between. It has been twenty years, who would still remember?!\u201dThe prisoner wagon2\u00a0rolled up to them. Ge Qingqing paid his obeisances to Ji Lei and said, \u201cYour Excellency, I\u2019ve brought him here.\u201d\u201cSend him in.\u201d Ji Lei then said to Shen Zechuan, \u201cAfter today\u2019s farewell, we probably won\u2019t have the chance to meet again. The Emperor\u2019s magnanimity knows no bound. You must remember this with gratitude for the rest of your life. \u201dShen Zechuan turned a deaf ear as he entered the Zhao Zui Temple. That vermillion door with paint peeling off it moved with a loud rumble. He stood in the middle and looked at Ji Lei. Ji Lei was displeased by his gaze and was about to lose his temper when he saw Shen Zechuan unveiled a smile on his cleansed face.He\u2019s gone mad.Ji Lei thought subconsciously. But then he heard Shen Zechuan say,\u201cYour Excellency Ji.\u201d His voice was calm. \u201cWe will meet again.\u201dThe vermillion door shut with a \u201cbang\u201d and stirred up a cloud of dust. Xiaofuzi covered his nose and coughed while stepping back repeatedly. But then, he saw Ji Lei standing motionlessly where he was.Ji Lei only returned to his senses after being called a few times. He swiftly mounted the horse. With the sun shining on his back, he cussed, \u201c\u2026 Bah. Just my rotten luck!\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xiao Chiye was riding his horse across the street when he bumped into Ji Lei. Reining it in, he laughed and said, \u201cOld Ji, aren\u2019t you on duty before the Emperor?\u201dJi Lei looked covetously at the battle steed under Xiao Chiye\u2019s crotch and said, \u201cI have to take that surviving criminal into custody at the temple today. I\u2019m now hurrying over to the palace. Second Young Master, that\u2019s an excellent steed! I heard you tamed it yourself?\u201d\u201cI had free time. \u201cXiao Chiye lashed out the horsewhip with a crack, and the gyrfalcon in the sky swiftly swooped down onto his shoulder. He said, \u201cTorturing falcons3\u00a0and playing with horses are all the talents I have.\u201d\u201cOnce you assume your duties after the new year,4\u00a0you\u2019ll be busy.\u201d Ji Lei said, \u201cQudu\u2019s latest eminence! I\u2019m not on duty tomorrow. How about a drink together?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cIf the wine isn\u2019t good, I\u2019m not going.\u201dJi Lei laughed out loud and said, \u201cOf course it\u2019s good wine! Who dares to invite the Second Young Master if the wine isn\u2019t good? I\u2019ll call at your residence later to invite you.\u00a0 Would the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0have the time to have fun together with us?\u201dXiao Chiye caressed his bone thumb ring5\u00a0and said, \u201cMy eldest brother, huh? He\u2019s not a fan of such activities. Why? It\u2019s not prestigious enough for you if I\u2019m the only one going?\u201dJi Lei hurriedly said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said! Second Young Master, that settles it then.\u201dXiao Chiye acknowledged him and kicked the horse to leave. But just before leaving, he seemed to recall something and asked, \u201cHow did that surviving criminal look? Can he walk?\u201d\u201cWalk, he can.\u201d Ji Lei responded. \u201cBut not nimbly enough from the way I see it. How many can actually survive floggings without post-injuries? He is lucky to be able to walk.\u201dXiao Chiye did not say a word more as he spurred his horse on and left.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8A little later, the errand-runner delivered the meals to Zhao Zui Temple. Shen Zechuan lit the oil lamp but did not touch the food. Grabbing the oil lamp, he walked a round along the small corridor beside the main hall.The dust had been accumulating here for a long time. Some side rooms in the wings had fallen into a state of dilapidation with the doors and windows already rotten. Shen Zechuan saw several skeletons that toppled over when the wind blew. Since he did not come across any living creature, he returned to the main hall.The Buddha statue had collapsed, and the incense altar was old but still durable. The size below was just right. Shen Zechuan hung up a tattered curtain cloth and lay down underneath with his clothes on. The cold from the floor made his legs hurt. He endured the pain and closed his eyes to count the hours.Fresh snow started to fall in the latter half of the night. Shen Zechuan listened as the night owl hooted twice. He sat up and lifted open the cloth just in time to see Ji Gang step through the door before him.\u201cAfter you\u2019ve eaten,\u201d Ji Gang opened the cloth bundle.6\u00a0\u201cTrain. This place can\u2019t keep the wind out at night. It\u2019s too cold.\u00a0Shifu\u00a0is afraid you will fall ill if you sleep.\u201dShen Zechuan looked at the roasted chicken wrapped in oil paper and said, \u201cOne should abstain from meat when ill.\u00a0Shifu, you can have it.\u201dJi Gang tore up the roasted chicken for him and said, \u201cBullshit! This is the time where you should eat your fill.\u00a0Shifu\u00a0likes to eat the rear end of the chicken; even at home, it\u2019s my favorite. Save it for me.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cSince I\u2019m following you, I will eat what you eat.\u201dJi Gang glanced at him and laughed. He said,\u201d Brat.\u201dMaster and disciple split the roasted chicken among them. Ji Gang seemed to have grown a mouthful of iron teeth as he chewed even the chicken bones into pieces. He handed the bottle gourd to Shen Zechuan and said, \u201cDrink some wine if you really can\u2019t put up with the cold. But don\u2019t drink too much. Just sip accordingly, just like your brother.\u201dThey never mentioned Zhongbo, Duanzhou, or even the Chashi Sinkhole these days.\u00a0Shiniang\u00a0and Ji Mu were unspoken wounds both master and disciple shared. Both of them thought they had hidden it pretty well, but they never realized that the blood was already seeping out and that the pain was mutual.Shen Zechuan took a sip and handed it over to Ji Gang.Ji Gang did not take it. He said, \u201cI\u2019ve quit.\u00a0Shifu\u00a0doesn\u2019t drink anymore.\u201dSilence descended in the hall. Without the shelter of the door, the snow fell before their very eyes, becoming the only scenery in this endless night.Ji Gang asked, \u201cWhy are you in a daze?\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cShifu.\u201d\u201cJust say it if you have something to say.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dAfter a long silence, Ji Gang said, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201dShen Zechuan clenched his fist. He stared at the snow as if the tears would fall if he blinked. His voice hitched as he said, \u201cDid you go looking for us at Chashi?\u201dJi Gang slowly leaned against the incense altar, burying his body within the shadows. It was as if he was looking for his own voice. After a long time, he said, \u201cI went. I found him.\u201dHe found him.Ji Gang found his son \u2013 all covered in arrows \u2013 in the pit of snow. He had jumped into it and stepped across those thick piles of corpses to dig out Ji Mu\u2019s body.Ji Mu was only twenty-three of age. He had just been promoted to Squad Commander of the Duanzhou Garrison Army. His armor was new. The day he put it on, Hua Pingting hung a protective talisman for her son in the lock. When Ji Gang found him, he had been frozen purple along with his other comrades.Shen Zechuan raised his head slightly and said, \u201cShifu, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dJi Gang was already old. He tousled his white hair and said, \u201cHe\u2019s the elder brother, isn\u2019t he? That\u2019s what he should do. Everything that happened is not your fault. \u201cThe snow fell for a moment.Ji Gang huddled over and said, \u201cWho would have known that those Biansha baldies would come? That he would become a soldier and charge to the very front of the battle is something that can\u2019t be helped. I taught him martial arts, and with that temperament of his, you might as well kill him than to ask him to flee. He could hardly bear to see others suffer and dragged down. So how would he, how would he flee?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault or his.\u00a0Shifu\u00a0is the one to be blamed. I indulged in excessive drinking. Your\u00a0shiniang\u00a0scolded me for so long, but I never quit. When the cavalry came, I couldn\u2019t even fight properly. At this age, I\u2019m old and disabled. I\u2019ve long gone useless.\u201dWater dripped onto the bottle gourd. Shen Zechuan gripped it and said nothing.\u201cOld and disabled.\u201d A grinning head suddenly poked out from behind the Buddha statue and said, \u201cOld and disabled!\u201dJi Gang sprang up like a leopard and bellowed, \u201cWho\u2019s there?!\u201dThe unkempt man gradually stretched his body out and imitated Ji Gang. \u201cWho, who!\u201dWhen Ji Gang heard this voice clearly, he pressed Shen Zechuan down and involuntarily blurted out in astonishment, \u201c\u2026 Grand Mentor7\u00a0Qi!\u201dThe man speedily shrank his head back. Kicking the Buddha statue, he yelled, \u201cI\u2019m not! I\u2019m not the Grand Mentor!\u201dJi Gang ran a few steps behind the Buddha statue in pursuit. When he saw the man about to bore his way through a hole to flee, he could not help but pounce and grab him by the ankle. The man immediately let out a squeal like a pig being slaughtered and shouted, \u201cYour Highness! Your Highness, flee quickly! \u201cShen Zechuan covered his mouth and joined forces with Ji Gang to carry him back.\u201cWho is this?\u201d Shen Zechuan asked.\u201cYou are young, so you\u2019ve never heard of him.\u201d Ji Gang\u2019s voice was unsteady as he pressed the man down and said, \u201cGrand Mentor Qi, this is great! You are still alive! What about His Excellency Zhou? Is His Excellency Zhou here too?\u201dGrand Mentor Qi was thin and small. He could not kick them away, so he glared at them and whispered, \u201cHe\u2019s dead, dead! I\u2019m dead. His Highness is dead. Everyone is dead!\u201dJi Gang said in a heavy voice, \u201cGrand Mentor, I am Ji Gang! The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0Vice Commander, Ji Gang!\u201dStill badly shaken, Grand Mentor Qi hesitantly raised his neck to look at Ji Gang\u2019s face. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re not Ji Gang. You\u2019re an evil spirit!\u201dJi Gang said sorrowfully, \u201cGrand Mentor! In the twenty-third year of Yongyi,8\u00a0 I escorted you into the capital. This was where His Royal Highness the Crown Prince met and welcomed you. Have you forgotten this too?\u201dGrand Mentor Qi\u2019s eyes glistened as he raved madly. \u201cThey killed the Crown Prince\u2026 Your Highness!\u201d He sobbed and said, \u201cJi Gang, Your Excellency Ji! Take His Highness away!\u00a0 The Eastern Palace has become the target of public censure. What crime has His Highness committed?!\u201dJi Gang dejectedly released his hands and said, \u201cGrand Mentor\u2026 In the twenty-ninth year, Ji Lei sold himself to the enemy. I\u2019ve already been kicked out of\u00a0Qudu. In these twenty years, I\u2019ve been reduced to a mere fugitive of the\u00a0martial fraternity. I have also gone on to take a wife and fathered a child in Duanzhou of Zhongbo.\u201dGrand Mentor Qi stared at him blankly and said, \u201c\u2026 His Highness is gone, but the Imperial Grandson is still around! Take him away. You, take him away!\u201dJi Gang could not help but close his eyes and said, \u201cIn the thirtieth year of Yongyi, the Crown Prince slit his own throat and committed suicide in this place. No one from the Eastern Palace returned alive.\u201dGrand Mentor Qi leaned back and muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right\u2026\u201d He sobbed like a child. \u201cHow did it come to this?\u201dThis night had made Ji Gang mentally and physically exhausted. He said, \u201cAfter the parting of drifting clouds, ten years have gone like flowing water.9\u00a0Who would expect that when we meet again in this life, it would be under such circumstances?\u201dGrand Mentor Qi turned his body to hide his face and said, \u201cDid they lock you up too? Let them lock! Let them kill all the literati in this world.\u201dJi Gang said, \u201cMy disciple is shouldering the blame for his father.\u201dGrand Mentor Qi said, \u201cShouldering the blame for his father\u2026 That\u2019s great. Who\u2019s his father? He couldn\u2019t have angered His Majesty too, could he?\u201dJi Gang sighed and said, \u201cLast year, Shen Wei\u2019s troops were defeated\u2026\u201dHe did not expect Grand Mentor Qi to turn his head suddenly upon hearing the words \u201cShen Wei\u201d and crawled on all fours towards Shen Zechuan. He asked, \u201cThis, is Shen Wei\u2019s son?\u201dJi Gang had a sense of foreboding and was about to act when Grand Mentor Qi beat him to it and pounced. Making a grab for Shen Zechuan with his wizened fingers, he said savagely, \u201cShen Wei! Shen Wei killed His Highness!\u201dSharp-eyed and agile, Shen Zechuan had already grasped Grand Mentor Qi by his wrists. Right after this, Ji Gang grabbed hold of Grand Mentor Qi and said, \u201cGrand Mentor! Do you want my disciple to die today for the same reason the Imperial Grandson did? No matter what crimes Shen Wei committed, it has nothing to do with my disciple!\u201dGrand Mentor Qi gasped heavily and spoke in a trembling voice. \u201cSince he\u2019s Shen Wei\u2019s son, Shen Wei\u2019s son\u2026\u201d\u201cHe was Shen Wei\u2019s son when he was born.\u201d Ji Gang held Grand Mentor Qi down and suddenly kowtowed. He continued, \u201cBut he later became Ji Gang\u2019s son. If I utter a single word of falsehood tonight, then I\u2019ll die a terrible death! Grand Mentor, are you going to kill my son?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 : Grand MentorDumbstruck, Grand Mentor Qi pulled his hands back. He turned his head away, refusing to look at Shen Zechuan. He had been imprisoned here, deranged for twenty years, hating everyone beyond this place. Yet, tonight, he had to persuade himself not to hate the son of his enemy.\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Grand Mentor Qi\u2019s voice sounded plaintive. \u201cThen, who can I kill now?!\u201dThe snow fell silently, and the crow in the courtyard flew away from the branch. The tattered curtain in the temple fluttered along with the wind. Grand Mentor Qi trembled and rose to his feet, then staggered with his arms raised high, devastated and inconsolable.\u201cThe die is cast! The victor emerges king, and the loser is the rebel. His Highness\u2019s virtuous name has been smeared, and you and I are those treacherous traitors doomed to be condemned by posterity! Who do I kill? I\u2019ll kill this muddleheaded and blind Heaven! Twenty years ago, His Highness\u2019s blood was spilled here. What have we done wrong? That the Emperor would be so ruthless to wipe us out?!\u201dTears poured down Grand Mentor Qi\u2019s face. His body trembled as he kneeled at the entrance of the hall and banged his head repeatedly on the floor.\u201cKill me now as well!\u201dThe snowy night was miserably cold. No one in the empty temple responded. It was in this way Grand Mentor Qi kneeled, just like that deteriorating and battered Buddha statue. Fragments of cotton-like snow covered him as he remained still and silent under this brilliantly illuminated\u00a0Qudu\u00a0night.An hour later, Ji Gang helped Grand Mentor Qi up, and the three men sat in a circle before the incense altar.\u201cMany things happened tonight because of me. I will take this opportunity and explain to my heart\u2019s content.\u201d Ji Gang lifted his sleeves and said, \u201cGrand Mentor, Chuan-er was born in the Shen Clan. He\u2019s Shen Wei\u2019s eight son of common birth. Eight years ago, the situation between the\u00a0lawful and common\u00a0factions in the Prince of Jianxing\u2019s Residence were as irreconcilable as fire and water. Shen Zhouji, the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0of Jianxing, won the favor of his father and reassigned his brothers of common birth out of the residence. At seven years of age, Chuan-er was sent back to Duanzhou, but his enlistment as a soldier to bolster the army numbers failed to work out. So he lived in the side courtyard to be raised by his mother\u2019s maid. But that woman was greedy and extravagant and often misappropriated the child\u2019s food rations. Pingting was on friendly terms with his mother. When she learned of this, she asked me to take Chuan-er back so that we could raise and nurture him.\u201dGrand Mentor Qi sneered and said, \u201cShen Wei himself was of common birth and had his share of injustices in his childhood. How ludicrous of him to favor those of lawful birth when he came to have sons later. What\u2019s more, he\u2019s such a lecher and went on to beget so many sons. What a sin!\u201d\u201cWe have repeatedly sent letters to the Prince Residence, but not once has Shen Wei ever replied. Grand Mentor, look at the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0of\u00a0Qudu. We have never heard of such blatant abandonment even among the son of common births of those clans.\u201d Ji Gang furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cAnd so it was like this that Chuan-er came to follow us. That time, Mu-er was fifteen of age. He was so delighted to see his younger brother. Since then, our family of four has settled down in Duanzhou. We even had to expend a lot of effort just to be able to get into the Military Service\u2019s Yellow Register.\u201d1After a moment\u2019s silence, Grand Mentor Qi said, \u201cYou left the capital bearing the name of a criminal. It\u2019s naturally difficult for you to register your household. It was precisely to suppress rebels and prevent civil unrest that His Royal Highness strictly enforced the Yellow Register system to record households back then.\u201dJi Gang said, \u201cI understand. Grand Mentor, what happened in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0after I left? How did His Royal Highness the Crown Prince end up in that state?\u201dGrand Mentor Qi pulled over the tattered curtain and wrapped it around his shoulders. He said gloomily, \u201c\u2026 After you left, Ji Wufan lost the confidence of the Emperor. Pan Rugui, having received the Emperor\u2019s favors for serving the Empress, took up the post of Brush-holding Director at the\u00a0Directorate of Ceremonial. As a result, the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0fell into decline, and its Twelve Offices existed in name only. After Ji Wufan\u2019s death, Ji Lei took up the mantle alone. From then on, the\u00a0Eastern Depot2\u00a0became the Godfather of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0and ceased to associate with the Eastern Palace. Later on, the Emperor suddenly fell ill and was frequently bedridden, so the trivial affairs of the court were handed over to the Grand Secretariat and the Eastern Palace to manage. But the Hua Clan relied on the Emperor\u2019s favor of the Empress to install many incompetent people in the court, and this led to the resurgence of Six Ministries\u2019 practice of bribery. The troubles that were the Empress Dowager\u2019s kin3\u00a0were now out in force. His Royal Highness the Crown Prince went many times to submit a memorial to His Majesty. But he never expected Pan Rugui to rely on his authority of office in endorsing memorials4\u00a0to take over control of government affairs with the Empress. There was no way His Royal Highness\u2019s memorial would ever make its way before the Emperor. Not only that, after the Emperor fell ill, the Empress stopped the Grand Secretariat and the Eastern Palace from paying their respects to him.\u201d\u201cThose castrated bunches are a menace to the empire!\u201d Ji Gang repeatedly sighed. \u201cIf I had known Pan Rugui harbored such ambitions, I would never have stopped Father from killing him!\u201d\u201cEven if you kill a Pan Rugui, there will still be a Pan Ruxi and a Pan Ruyi!\u201d Grand Mentor said in a daze. \u201cThe harem interferes in state affairs, while their kin runs rampant. Ji Gang, you don\u2019t understand. These are all the deeply rooted maladies of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans. As long as all the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0are not eradicated, history will just repeat! How is the Empress able to control the affairs of the imperial court when she has lived for so long in the inner palace? It\u2019s all due to the long-amassed power and influence of the Hua Clan. Even if the Empress wasn\u2019t a Hua back then \u2013 even if the Empress was someone from one of the other\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0\u2013 this would still happen.\u201d\u201cBut.\u201d Shen Zechuan could not help asking, \u201cIsn\u2019t His Royal Highness the Crown Prince of lawful birth by the Empress herself?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi lowered his head. \u201cHis Royal Highness\u2019s biological mother was an imperial concubine. The Empress was childless, having never given birth before. But His Royal Highness was taken to the inner palace and personally raised by the Empress herself. As the saying goes, even a tiger will not eat its own cubs\u2026 Kinship doesn\u2019t exist in the Imperial Clan.\u201dThe hall fell silent again.Ji Gang let out a breath of cold air and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cMy father lost the favor of the Emperor because my excessive drinking bungled up matters. If it weren\u2019t for this, His Royal Highness would never have come here.\u201d\u201cI initially thought that Ji Lei would not have become a turncoat if there\u2019s Ji Wufan before you.\u201d Grand Mentor clutched the tattered curtain. Recalling it still left a bitter taste in his mouth. \u201cWho would have known that he\u2026\u201d\u201cGrand Mentor, you are unaware of it.\u201d Ji Gang looked at Shen Zechuan. \u201cChuan-er didn\u2019t know it either. My father, Ji Wufan, was sworn friends with the former Emperor. He was also the Commander-in-chief of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. But Father\u2019s first wife died early and he had no intention to remarry, so he adopted three sons. Besides me and Ji Lei, there was also Eldest Brother. Eldest Brother could not bear the malicious acts in the\u00a0Imperial Prison, and so he left the capital in his adolescence and went to Tianfei Watchtower to be a soldier there. Ji Lei and I served in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0and remained by Father\u2019s side to look after him as a show of filial piety. This set of Ji Clan\u2019s Boxing Style and Ji Clan\u2019s Blade Style were all taught by Father. Later, due to several incidents, Father felt that Ji Lei was harboring evil intentions and suspected him of currying favor, so he only imparted the Ji Clan\u2019s Mental Cultivation Techniques to me. But this entirely created a divide between us brothers. After Father\u2019s death, Ji Lei did an overhaul of those under his command. Many of the old guards were let go. From then on, the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2026 were no longer what they once were.\u201dGrand Mentor Qi murmured, \u201cSuch is fate. The Eastern Palace\u2019s subordinates joined forces and worked as one but still failed to protect His Royal Highness. The Emperor suspected His Royal Highness of staging a rebellion, but the authority for the Eight Great Training Divisions of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0all lay in the hands of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0found the treason documents and asserted that it was His Royal Highness behind it. Our people were sent to the\u00a0Imperial Prison, and many of them died. Those who could not withstand the punishments finally gave in. The sick Emperor flew into a rage and believed Pan Rugui\u2019s slanders. From then on, His Royal Highness was trapped in a dead-end.\u201dTears drenched his face as he seemed to go insane again.\u201cHis Royal Highness was here, trapped in a dead-end! Why didn\u2019t they kill me? How do they expect me to hang on to my last breath till now? Living a life like this is worse than death. Yet I still can\u2019t hurry on my way to the Underworld.\u201dHe suddenly stared at Shen Zechuan, and his tone turned frenzied.\u201c\u2014I can\u2019t take this lying down! Years of strategic and tactical planning have all gone down the drain! Countless Eastern Palace\u2019s aides have been killed and wounded, and the injustice His Royal Highness suffered has yet to be redressed. I can\u2019t take this lying down! \u201cHe grabbed Shen Zechuan\u2019s arm again.\u201d You are so young. You still have a chance!\u201d\u201cGrand Mentor\u2026\u201d Ji Gang rose intending to stop him.\u201cYou can protect him for a moment, but can you protect him for life?\u201d Grand Mentor Qi gripped Shen Zechuan tightly. \u201cI can stop hating or blaming him today on account of your fatherly affection, but can you make everyone in this world think this way? As long as his surname is Shen, there will be plenty of people wanting to kill him! Can he really sleep with a peace of mind just because he is skilled in martial arts? Ji Gang, your father was a martial arts master, but didn\u2019t he still end up dying of illness all alone?!\u00a0 In this\u00a0Qudu, where the tides of power ebb and flow, it\u2019s killing someone with invisible means that\u2019s the most fatal! How could you have the heart to let him face the predators stark-naked!\u201dJi Gang clenched his fists and said nothing.Tugging Shen Zechuan, Grand Mentor Qi went down on both knees. He looked at Shen Zechuan and said in a trembling voice that was choking with sobs, \u201cI\u2019m Qi Huilian from Yuzhou! You don\u2019t know me, so I\u2019m telling you. I\u2019m, I\u2019m the Triple Yuan5\u00a0Top Scholar in the fifteenth year of Yongyi.6\u00a0From the founding of Dazhou to this date, there are only five people who have come out first in all three levels of the civil examination. I\u2019m a subordinate of the Eastern Palace and also the Minister of Personnel of the Ministry of Personnel-cum-Deputy Grand Secretary of the Grand Secretariat. I taught the Crown Prince. And I\u2019ll now, now teach you! I\u2019ll teach you everything I have learned in my life\u2014alright?\u201dShen Zechuan stared into Grand Mentor Qi\u2019s eyes. He was unusually calm. After that brief silence, he fell to the ground on his knees with a \u201cthud\u201d and kowtowed thrice to Grand Mentor Qi.\u201cIf Teacher imparts the classics to me, I\u2019ll kill your enemy for you.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Ge Qingqing went out at the\u00a0hour of Mao7\u00a0and headed for Zhao Zui Temple. The air was clear and cold along the way, and it even snowed. He huffed into his hands and looked for a steamed bun stall as he walked.He heard the sounds of someone calling him from afar. There was a red silk umbrella unfurled among the snow, and the person under the umbrella swayed slightly as he moved towards him. Those who could hold up red silk umbrellas in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0were all bigwigs of fifth grade8\u00a0and above.Ge Qingqing stood by the side of the road and supported his blade as he paid his obeisances. The thick smell of wine assailed his nose as the person staggered his way before him.\u201cThe Red Cavalry.\u201d9\u00a0This person stopped and reached out a hand to pull Ge Qingqing\u2019s waist token.10\u00a0He looked at it for a moment and said, \u201cWhere is Company Commander Ge going now? It\u2019s freezing cold.\u201dGe Qingqing stared at the man\u2019s black boots and answered, \u201cTo reply Your Excellency, this humble subordinate is on office duty today and ought to be heading for the palace.\u201dXiao Chiye had been drinking all night, and his clothes were in disarray. He dangled the waist token and said, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem to be the way to the palace.\u201dGe Qingqing raised his head to reveal a shy smile and said, \u201cThe Second Young Master is noble and does not know how much of a clutter these civilian alleys are. From here, you can make your way through a few civilian alleys and you\u2019ll be able to turn into Shenwu Street, which will lead you straight to the palace gate.\u201dOn hearing this, Xiao Chiye smiled and threw back the waist token to him. He asked, \u201cYou know who I am?\u201dGe Qingqing caught hold of the waist token and buttered him up, \u201cThe Armored Cavalry of Libei are brave and skillful in warfare. The\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0and Second Young Master have rendered meritorious service in coming to the Emperor\u2019s aid. Who in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0does not know of you? Second Young Master, are you heading back to your residence? The road is slippery. May this subordinate be so bold as to ask if you need me to send you back?\u201dXiao Chiye looked at him and said, \u201cDo I look like a drunkard? You may leave.\u201dGe Qingqing bowed again and left.When Zhao Hui arrived, he saw Xiao Chiye rapping hard with the red silk umbrella and yelling at the steamed bun stall to hurry. He approached and said, \u201cThe residence has prepared breakfast. Why is Young Master standing here to have your meal?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cI\u2019m too hungry to walk back.\u201dZhao Hui shook the cloak open and said, \u201cWine and lust will only lead you astray. Young Master, let\u2019s go home.\u201dXiao Chiye draped himself with the cloak but did not move his feet. He ate two steamed buns, taking no notice of the gazes of those around him. He asked Zhao Hui, \u201cCan one reach Shenwu Street from here?\u201d\u201cYes, but it\u2019s not an easy path to walk.\u201d Zhao Hui replied. \u201cCivilian alleys with state-owned ditches. The narrower the alley, the more polluted the ditch water.\u00a0Qudu\u00a0has never repaired the public ditches in recent years, and this piece of land is rotten beyond recognition. Once the weather warms up, the snow melts, and the rain falls, the sewage will flood the streets. Think about it, is such a path a smooth one to take?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cI only asked you one question. Why give such a long reply?\u201dZhao Hui said, \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that you must be sure to take the correct path. Young Master, there\u2019s no hurry to drink. If you take a detour instead, you will make your way there even faster.\u201dXiao Chiye wiped his hands and motioned Zhao Hui to fish out his money. \u201cThat\u2019s really strange. Go make some inquiries if there are any official records of someone called Ge Qingqing on duty in the Twelves Offices of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0today\u2014Old man, find another line of work as soon as you can; this steamed bun tastes really bad.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 : SuspicionThe\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0was waiting to rotate shifts. It was so freezing cold that they were all huddled into themselves.The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0was originally the Imperial Guards1\u00a0of the Eight Cities. They were the impregnable fortress of the Imperial Palace in\u00a0Qudu. Going by the rules, trivialities such as taking a person into custody would not have been tasked to them. But then the Eight Great Training Divisions of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0rose to power, and the duties and responsibilities of both parties were switched around. The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0was reduced to being the burden of\u00a0Qudu. It not only abolished the military drills, but even literally became the errand-runner of\u00a0Qudu. Today, they were all hereditary military households who had never seen real weaponry and were just idling around waiting to die.Ge Qingqing was the Company Commander of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. He was not really considered an official in\u00a0Qudu, but he was just perfect for the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0in charge of detention. This was because they had to mutually look out for each other as they patrolled\u00a0Qudu\u00a0every day. If it had been an official of a slightly higher rank, they would not have dared to bribe as they wished. Besides, Ge Qingqing was extremely generous in his treatment of them. So the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0turned a blind eye and let Ji Gang take on the chores of the original errand-runner.Ge Qingqing greeted the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0and distributed the hot steamed buns he had brought with him. Ji Gang had yet to come out. The Squad Commander saw him looking pensive, so he said, \u201cIf Brother Qing is in a hurry, please go ahead and check it out on our behalf.\u201dGe Qingqing said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be against the rules?\u201dBiting the steamed bun, the Squad Commander waved his hand to motion to the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0guarding the back door to make way. He said, \u201cBrother Qing isn\u2019t an outsider. Besides, we have surrounded this Zhao Zui Temple until not even a drop of water can trickle through. The man within can\u2019t escape for sure.\u201dThus, Ge Qingqing did not decline his offer further. He turned around to enter Zhao Zui Temple.Ji Gang was sitting under the eaves. When he saw Ge Qingqing coming, he stood up and asked, \u201cIs it time already?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter since it\u2019s still dark. Uncle Ji can stay a little longer.\u201d Ge Qingqing surveyed the temple courtyard as he spoke. \u201cThis place is not fit for human living. And it happens to be in the dead of winter right now. I\u2019ll send some quilts over later.\u201dNoting that he seemed to have something on his mind, Ji Gang asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dGe Qingqing hesitated and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s just that I met Second Young Master Xiao on the way earlier.\u201dShen Zechuan raised his head and said, \u201cThat Xiao\u2026\u201d\u201cXiao Chiye.\u201d Ge Qingqing said, \u201cHe\u2019s the youngest son of the Prince of Libei. He\u2019s also\u2026 that same man from the other time. His gait is unsteady, and he reeks of wine. He must have gone drinking last night.\u201d\u201cAs long as it isn\u2019t Xiao Jiming.\u201d Ji Gang turned his head back to say to Grand Mentor Qi, \u201cGrand Mentor has not left this place for twenty years. You probably don\u2019t know the current Four Great Generals of Dazhou. The Prince of Libei has begotten himself a good son. That Xiao Jiming is truly remarkable!\u201dBut Shen Zechuan asked Ge Qingqing, \u201cBrother Qing, did he ask you something?\u201dGe Qingqing thought carefully and said, \u201cHe asked me where I was going, and I said I was taking a shortcut to get to the command office. Then he said that this road did not seem to lead to Shenwu Street. So I gave him a perfunctory response. I suppose the descendant of a princely noble like him will not personally probe into it.\u201d\u201cBut this matter involves the Xiao Clan. It pays to be careful. Later on, you should still head for the palace and put a mark on the duty roster. \u201cJi Gang rubbed his hands in the snow. \u201cChuan-er, let\u2019s train.\u201d\u201cHold it.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes were dark and deep. \u201cSince it is a miscellaneous alley in a civilian district, then what is a noble descendant like him doing on this street so early in the morning?\u201dGe Qingqing was stupefied. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026 The entertainment spots are all in Donglong Street, which is some distance away from the residential area. He\u2019s nursing a hangover, and it\u2019s such a cold day. Why did he come here?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s keeping watch at a tree to await a rabbit.\u201d2\u00a0Grand Mentor Qi wrapped himself in the tattered curtain and turned around, pointing his posterior out. He said, \u201cThe matter of Shen Wei concerns the Xiao Clan. I heard that that kick of his was clearly aiming for this lad\u2019s life. But the lad\u2019s still alive and well now. How could he not get suspicious?\u201d\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have said another word if he didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d Shen Zechuan was still full of trepidation as he recalled that kick.\u201cOh, no.\u201d Ge Qingqing turned pale and said, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault for being negligent. What should we do? I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s already on the way!\u201dShen Zechuan turned towards Grand Mentor Qi. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Since Teacher has already guessed it, he must have a countermeasure.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Zhao Hui arrived at the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0Command Office. Although the Assistant Commander walking with him was of the same rank as him, he did not dare to put on airs. He led Zhao Hui to the records room and said, \u201cWhat does General Zhao want to check? These are all Twelves Offices\u2019 duty rosters for today.\u201dZhao Hui solemnly picked up a book to flip through for a look and said, \u201cIt has been hard on our\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0brothers patrolling the restricted grounds. A few days ago, I received the assistance of a Company Commander named Ge Qingqing. I\u2019ve come today bearing a gift to give my thanks. Is he on duty today?\u201d\u201cThe Company Commanders from the Twelves Office are a motley crew. They are all inside.\u201d As the Assistant Commander spoke, he shifted over to the wall where the duty registers of the Twelve Offices were hanging on the upper side, all clearly categorized.But Zhao Hui could not touch them; this was taboo in the palace.The Assistant Commander asked, \u201cDoes the General know which office does he belong to?\u201dZhao Hui said, \u201cI heard that only those from the Imperial Carriage Office, Parasol Office, and the Domesticated Elephants Office could be on duty on the morning shift.\u201dThe Assistant Commander carefully checked through the registers by name. After a while, he turned and said to Zhao Hui, \u201cGeneral, there\u2019s no such person on duty today.\u00a0 Let me try looking elsewhere for you?\u201dZhao Hui gently closed the book in his hands and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need. I\u2019ll find him on my own.\u201dWhen Zhao Hui left the records room, the sky had just brightened. He went back along the road and strode out of the palace.The accumulated snow had been freshly swept off Shenwu Street, but the road was slippery. The sedan bearers who came and went as they transported the bigwigs did not dare to be rash. They walked on the road cautiously and made every effort to stay steady on their feet.As Zhao Hui passed by a sedan, he caught a glimpse of the sedan bearers bearing broadswords. Who would have known that this one look would make him furrow his eyebrows?\u201cHold it.\u201d Zhao Hui stopped the sedan chair and asked, \u201cIs this the chair used by the Commander-in-Chief?\u201dSure enough, the sedan bearers were the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. The one in the lead nodded and said, \u201cYou know who we are transporting, and you still have the audacity to block our way? Move out of the way quickly!\u201dZhao Hui raised his hand to reveal his own Libei waist token.3The Imperial Bodyguard nodded and said, \u201cGeneral, please excuse me for the offense!\u201dThe sedan curtain moved as a slender hand lifted it. A delicate face glanced lazily at Zhao Hui and pouted coquettishly to the person within. \u201cYour Excellency, he\u2019s looking for you!\u201dJi Lei had just returned with a hangover. Sitting unreservedly in the sedan, he said to Zhao Hui, \u201cGeneral Zhao! What\u2019s the matter?\u201dZhao Hui merely stared at the Imperial Bodyguard in the lead and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I heard Young Master went drinking with Your Excellency last night. Are you only just returning?\u201dJi Lei smiled and said, \u201cSo you\u2019re worried about the Second Young Master! The Young Master returned home the moment I opened my eyes this morning. Is the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0looking for him?\u201d\u201cI just can\u2019t help worrying.\u201d Zhao Hui bowed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have alarmed Your Excellency.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine! I just came from there myself.\u201d Ji Lei gestured with his hand. \u201cWho was it that butt heads with the General earlier? Hurry and apologize to the General.\u201dThe Imperial Bodyguard in the lead kneeled on one knee and said to Zhao Hui, \u201cThis humble servant, Ge Qingqing, was blind not to recognize the General, thus offending you. I\u2019m willing to accept my punishment.\u201dZhao Hui had not misread.Ge Qingqing\u2019s name was indeed written on the waist token hanging at the side of his blade.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Even after listening to Zhao Hui complete his report, Xiao Chiye was still looking at the storytelling script\u00a04\u00a0with one of his legs propped up.Zhao Hui said, \u201cFrom how it looks, he didn\u2019t lie. He was assigned to pick up Ji Lei before he could enter the palace.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Xiao Chiye said absent-mindedly. \u201cQingjun Pavilion is just nearly. Of course he can make it in time.\u201d\u201cBut something feels off to me.\u201d Zhao Hui\u2019s thumb caressed the hilt of his blade.Xiao Chiye turned the page and asked, \u201cYou can\u2019t figure it out?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d He suddenly sat up, crossed his legs, and propped up a hand on one knee. \u201cYou entered the Capital with my eldest brother. His Majesty the Emperor personally met and welcomed him. The Twelve Offices of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0followed closely behind in a ceremonial procession. How could he not recognize you now?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say.\u201d Zhao Hui said, \u201cPerhaps he didn\u2019t remember me.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t even changed your robe, and you carry a blade on you. Even if he doesn\u2019t recognize you, all he has to do is to use his brain a little, and he wouldn\u2019t dare to reproach you in such a condescending manner right there on the street.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cBesides, he doesn\u2019t seem like he has a bad memory to me. He could even recognize me clearly.\u201d\u201cI only find it too much of a coincidence.\u201d Zhao Hui pondered over it. \u201cI just happened to run into him.\u201d\u201cA coincidence is exactly what they want.\u201d Xiao Chiye cast aside the storytelling script. \u201cThis Shen\u2026\u201d\u201cShen Zechuan.\u201d Zhao Hui said.\u201cLetting him enter Zhao Zui Temple now looks like a losing move.\u201d Xiao Chiye said with a thoughtful gaze.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Ge Qingqing removed the fur collar and wiped his sweat.Wu Caiquan, who was outside, came running in pressing his legs together. He repeatedly said, \u201cThank you, thank you! Brother Qing, thank goodness for you!\u201dGe Qingqing said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. We are all comrades.\u201dWu Caiquan grinned and turned his head to yell at the person in the records room, \u201cOld Xu! Put Brother Qing on the record for today, he stood in for me to carry the sedan. I caught a cold last night and felt dizzy this morning. Fortunately, Brother Qing was there to help.\u201dGe Qingqing lowered his head to wipe his sweat. He said, \u201cYou caught a cold. Let\u2019s go to the Xu household\u2019s shop for mutton soup together later.\u201dWu Caiquan hastened to say, \u201cSure, it\u2019s Brother Qing\u2019s treat! Old Xu, did you hear that? Let\u2019s go together later! \u201c\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it.\u201d Ge Qingqing patted Wu Caiquan on the back. \u201cRest well. If you don\u2019t feel well the next time, don\u2019t hold it in like you did this time. Just tell me.\u201dWu Caiquan nodded his head like a puppy. He was craving mutton soup so much that he could hardly care about anything else.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Grand Mentor Qi was finally bundled up in a quilt at night. He sat opposite Shen Zechuan and said, \u201cIn another half a month, it\u2019ll be the Zhengdan Festival.5\u00a0Qudu\u00a0will host the \u2018Banquet of Ten Thousand Officials\u2019. When the time comes, all the Provincial Administration Commissioners and Prefectural Surveillance Commissioners of the various lands will enter the Capital to offer their greetings. I\u2019m still not clear about the current state of affairs, so tell me now.\u201dShen Zechuan was in the snow dressed only in flimsy clothes as he struck up the starting stance of the Ji Clan Fist. Despite it, sweat was dripping off his forehead. He said, \u201cThe Prince of Libei has been in poor health for many years, and all military affairs have been handed over to the\u00a0Hereditary Prince, Xiao Jiming, to handle on his behalf. In all likelihood, he won\u2019t attend this time. The Qidong Five Commanderies have rendered meritorious service in coming to the Emperor\u2019s rescue. The first one who came to receive his bestowed title was one of the four generals, Lu Guangbai. Commander-in-chief Qi should be arriving these few days. With this, two major military powers of Dazhou will be temporarily residing\u2014\u201d\u201cHold it.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi fished out a ruler6\u00a0from his quilt and asked, \u201cWhich four generals are the four generals?\u201d\u201cRiver of Ice Armored Cavalry, Xiao Jiming; Fire Beacon Amidst Blowing Sand, Lu Guangbai; Wind Guiding the Scorching Plains, Qi Zhuyin; Thunder Sinking the Jade Stage, Zuo Qianqiu!\u201d7\u201cI have only heard about Zuo Qianqiu. But I know that Lu Guangbai is most likely the son of the Earl of Biansha, Lu Pingyan. Although Lu Pingyan later came to guard the deserts of the Bianjun Commandery, he was from Libei in his early years. He\u2019s sworn brothers with the Prince of Libei, Xiao Fangxu. If this Lu Guangbai has a sister, she would definitely be the Xiao Clan\u2019s daughter-in-law, am I right? \u201c\u201cYes.\u201d Shen Zechuan said as he dripped with sweat. \u201cLu Guangbai\u2019s younger sister is the Consort of Libei\u2019s\u00a0Hereditary Prince.\u201d\u201cSo, where did the two major military powers come from?\u201d Grand Mentor Qi said, \u201cWith this connection, the Lu Clan is the mole Libei planted in the Qidong Five Commanderies to lurk within. Furthermore, there\u2019s still the Eight Great Training Divisions in\u00a0Qudu, and the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0under the Eight Great Training Divisions. The Eight Great Training Divisions don\u2019t have as many people as those from Libei and Qidong, and its reputation is not as valiant as theirs either. But you must remember that\u00a0Qudu\u00a0is the heart of Dazhou. What they are holding in their hands is the Emperor\u2019s life.\u201dGrand Mentor Qi weighed the ruler in his hand, then grabbed the gourd and warmed himself with a few sips of wine.\u201cYou also must remember this. Although the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0cannot be called \u2018soldiers\u2019, their advantage is far greater than that of \u2018soldiers\u2019. When the Emperor commands the troops, he must be assisted by influential officials and valiant generals. A general should exercise good discretion on the battlefield and not be bound by orders of his sovereign.8\u00a0Keep a tight rein, and it\u2019d be hard for them to make something of themselves. Maintain a loose grip, and you\u2019ll soon suspect them of becoming too much of a tiger.9\u00a0This yardstick is difficult to grasp. You need to act in accordance with the situation and understand how to adapt to changes. However, the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0is a different matter altogether. They are the vicious hounds under the Emperor\u2019s command, and that chain is held by the Emperor alone. Whether to tighten or loosen his grip, or to pamper or discard them, wholly depends on the Emperor\u2019s moods. Such a blade, such a dog\u2014If it were you, would you like them, or would you not?\u201dShen Zechuan pushed himself to hang on for a moment, then said, \u201cLike them\u2014and they will go wayward! Favor and trust them too much, and they will become the source of calamity.\u201d\u201cYour brother sure has taught you plenty.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Remember it. Commit it to memory! Favor and trust them too much, and they will become the source of calamity. Keeping the virtuous close and the flatterers far is a good virtue to cultivate. But when you are personally involved, black and white will intersect. How will you be forever able to distinguish who are the virtuous talents and who are the crafty sycophants? Besides, there are many matters that even a virtuous gentleman cannot do, while the crafty and the despicable ones can. The Emperor resides long-term in the Imperial Palace. He must understand the principle of checks and balances as well as listen to the voices of the various officials and ministers. As you can see, with the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0comes the\u00a0Eastern Depot, and with Libei comes along Qidong.\u201dAfter a pause, Grand Mentor Qi continued.\u201cWater brims only to overflow, the moon waxes only to wane.10\u00a0Do you know why the Xiao Clan hates Shen Wei so much this time? Not only is there nothing else to bestow or confer them with after this battle, but even if the Xiao Clan fights another battle, their defeat is a defeat, while their victory is also fundamentally a defeat. They have already reached their end.\u201dShen Zechuan asked, \u201cTheir victory is also a defeat?\u201d\u201cTheir victory is also a defeat! Didn\u2019t Xiao Jiming instantly offer up his younger brother after winning the battle? For every battle he wins in the future, he will be in even more of a peril. This time he paid for it with his younger brother. Next time, it might be his wife, his father, or even his own self.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 : PromotionSince the end of the year, many of the pedestrians on the streets of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0wore \u201cnao\u2019e\u201d1\u00a0made of black gold paper.2\u00a0As Zhengdan Festival3\u00a0approached, the common folks strove to prepare pastries and cooked meat at home. The palace had started procuring the ingredients for the \u2018Banquet of Ten Thousand Officials\u2019 half a month in advance. Everyone from the Court of Imperial Entertainments was busy running all over, yet the eunuchs still got to line their pockets.Xiao Chiye rustled his way through the book and said, \u201cWhen those officials on the outside enter the Capital, it is inevitable for them to have to pay \u2018ice respect\u20194\u00a0to the officials in the Capital. But Pan Rugui is so impressive that he drew up such a well-organized list: only when they shell out the money according to his list will they be left in peace.\u201d\u201cAnd these are only just the \u2018small changes\u2019 at the beginning of the year.\u201d Lu Guangbai brushed aside the foam in his tea. \u201cLet me give you an account. The money the little eunuch under Pan Rugui receives in a year far exceeds the two-year salary of a Battalion Commander Guard at the frontier. Dazhou uses the military troops every year, and each time the Ministry of Revenue asks us to deploy the troops, they have to plead with us and coax us to do so. But after the battle is over, we become the bastards who demand our payments.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the ones with the money who are the masters.\u201d Xiao Chiye smiled and said.\u201cWhen we came to the Emperor\u2019s rescue before the new year, our Libei troops braved the snow to march forward. The men and horses are tired, and the repairs for the Armored Cavalry\u2019s equipment need to be completed before the start of Spring. We have owed the workshop money for too many days. Everything requires money.\u201d Zhao Hui carefully made the calculations in his mind and said, \u201cBefore we entered\u00a0Qudu, the Libei troops engaged in farming duties5\u00a0converted the annual grain harvest into money. Every day, we have to count every cent and make every cent count. Our\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u2019s Consort does not even dare to purchase expensive attire for the Residence during the new year and other festivals. The money a palace eunuch like Pan Rugui has collected has already exceeded Duanzhou\u2019s total tax amount. The Investigating Censors throw their weight around when they are delegated to local governments. But so what? In\u00a0Qudu, they don\u2019t even dare to let out a fart!\u201d\u201cWhat to do, we are poor.\u201d Lu Guangbai lamented, \u201cEvery year, we have to worry about money. Jiming made a trip to the Capital this time, so the Ministry of Revenue did not dare to delay it on his account and had long submitted the request to the Grand Secretariat. Pan Rugui has also behaved himself and endorsed his approval. The funds should be handed over before he leaves the Capital.\u201d\u201cWe have Eldest Brother.\u201d Xiao Chiye set aside the book and looked towards Lu Guangbai. \u201cBut what are you going to do?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty wouldn\u2019t see me.\u201d Lu Guangbai said, \u201cThe Lu Clan is unpopular in\u00a0Qudu. The\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0have always regarded us as savages from the desert, and the Hua Clan wouldn\u2019t even look us right in the eyes. But even if you tell me to show my \u2018respects\u20196\u00a0to Pan Rugui, I don\u2019t have the money to. We are so poor at home we could barely put food on the table. Other places could cultivate lands for their troops to farm, and that is at least an emergency measure to meet needs. But our Bianjun Commandery has just yellow sand for miles around. Even if we want to farm, we don\u2019t have the fields. This time, we dispatched the troops out on a swift expedition, and all the food for the men and horses during the journey were paid for with Commander-in-Chief Qi\u2019s personal savings. To put it bluntly, it was all thanks to Commander-in-Chief Qi\u2019s understanding and sympathy. Otherwise, my troops would have never made it past Tianfei Watchtower. But how much money would Commander-in-Chief Qi have? She\u2019s using the remnants of her own dowry that the Old Imperial Consort has left for her! Her own private troops are almost on the verge of selling their own pants! The Ministry of Revenue keeps playing Taiji7\u00a0with me every day. Dereliction of duty, huh? They keep pushing my account aside and refuse to allocate the funds to me, figuring that a country bumpkin like me could do nothing about them.\u201dLu Guangbai lost his temper in a rare display of anger. He could not help it. The Bianjun Commandery was defending along the borders of the desert, and they were the Garrison Troops that had the most dealings with the Biansha Cavalry other than Libei. They worked themselves to death all year round, running all over the place just to eke out a living under the blades of the machetes. They barely had sufficient sleep, and would never get to eat their fill.\u00a0Qudu\u00a0was oppressing him, and the Earl of Biansha had long become a well-known pauper among the Princes. His clan had never even kept any of the rewards bestowed to them; all of it had been converted into money and used to supplement military supplies.Once Xiao Jiming was neatly dressed, the maidservants left in a single file, leaving only the four of them in the room. Xiao Jiming held up the teacup and took a sip of his tea. He said unhurriedly, \u201cThe timing is good this year\u2014Zhengdan\u2019 Banquet of Ten Thousand Officials\u2019. Qi Zhuyin should be here already, right?\u201dLu Guangbai said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. I was originally worried, but on second thought, let them do as they please and drag this matter on. If they delay it until the Commander-in-Chief enters the Capital, well then, good luck to them.\u201dXiao Jiming said, \u201cShe is now the most popular in\u00a0Qudu. Even those local ruffians and hooligans that are the \u2018loansharks\u2019 in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0have to give her face. The previous debt can be repaid, but you can\u2019t always rely on her alone. The Bianjun Commandery is important. From what I\u2019ve heard of the situation yesterday, the Ministry of Revenue will be asking you to recruit soldiers again this year.\u201dLu Guangbai caressed the rim of the teacup and said, \u201cRecruit? Don\u2019t even think about it. They are all afraid of death now that something happened to the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo. They are concerned about the Bianjun Commandery getting stabbed by the Biansha Twelve Tribes, and they even feel that my twenty thousand troops and horses aren\u2019t enough. The thing is that we can recruit the soldiers, but do we have the money to pay them? I can\u2019t afford to feed and train them. I will not do it even if they hold up a blade to my neck this year.\u201dXiao Chiye suddenly sat upright and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. In the past, the Ministry of Revenue was the quickest when it comes to assigning military funds and rations to the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo. The men died this time, so we can leave aside the issue of the money. But where are the grains? The Biansha Cavalry can\u2019t carry away that much grain with them when they flee.\u201dThe remaining three men looked at him.Lu Guangbai said, \u201cSilly lad, you can stop wondering about that. The grain was recovered and used to make up for the salary arrears owed to the Thirteen Cities of Juexi last year. Can\u2019t you guess the reason the Ministry of Revenue dodged the issue? In recent years, the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0have become the Eight Great Training Divisions, and their equipment and budgets are the best in Dazhou. All this money is taken right from the tax funds. Think about it, the sum of two million. Any human would know how insane this account is. But both the Empress Dowager and Secretariat Elder Hua did not pursue this matter. So who in the Ministry of Revenue who would dare to bring it up? The State Treasury is emptied of this portion of the money. Last year, the Thirteen Cities of Juexi were hit by a plague of locusts, and there was truly not a single grain harvested that year. So, where would they get the money for disaster relief? It was all thanks to the Provincial Administration Commissioner, Jiang Qingshan, who issued a peremptory order for all the officials of various ranks within the prefecture to release their private stock of grains to help the disaster victims. Because of this, Jiang Qingshan saved hundreds of thousands of commoners, but he ended up being hated by the various officials in Juexi. Before the new year, I heard that the debt collectors were even blocking the entrance to his house. He is a high-ranking provincial official of the second-grade, and yet his eighty years old mother still has to weave to pay off their debt! It would be forcing them to their death if\u00a0Qudu\u00a0still did not release the money. In the end, Secretariat Elder Hai submitted a memorial and contended with the Grand Secretariat and Pan Rugui for half a month before they barely made up for the shortfall.\u201dZhao Hui could not help but say, \u201cThose people say they are poor, but the amounts of bribe money are all large sums. On the other hand, those doing the real work are all walking on eggshells while tightening their belts. We might as well not come to\u00a0Qudu\u00a0this time. It really makes one disheartened.\u201dIt was snowing outside the house, but there was no festive atmosphere within. The mess kept piling up one after another, and all the new sights in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0were like mist skimming the surface. Its wound had yet to heal, and yet they still had to cover it up even as pus dirtied its entire grounds. The snow came at just the right time to conceal it all so beautifully that they could pretend not to notice. Everyone could all live like a drunk in this fool\u2019s paradise together.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8In the middle of the night, Pan Rugui sat on the couch with his eyes closed. The naturally-colored paper flower was placed by his hand so that he could wipe his hands after meditation. Xiaofuzi did not even dare to breathe heavily as he held a brush case in his hands and waited carefully on the footrest.After an hour, Pan Rugui exhaled and opened his eyes. Xiaofuzi immediately presented the brush to him. With a frown of concentration, Pan Rugui wrote a few words in his palm.Xiaofuzi buttered up to him and said, \u201cOur Forefather is becoming more and more sagely after having recently received His Majesty\u2019s teachings. Earlier, this grandson even saw a faint wisp of purple cloud8\u00a0rising!\u201dPang Rugui wiped his hands and asked, \u201cDo you know why you have never been able to join the\u00a0Directorate of Ceremonial?\u201dXiaofuzi replied, \u201cForefather dotes on me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to dote on you.\u201d Pan Rugui threw the paper flower into Xiaofuzi\u2019s bosom. \u201cNot being able to read the situation is another. His Majesty has been enlightened for two years, and he still doesn\u2019t give off purple aura. I\u2019m merely a slave. How can I ascend first? Isn\u2019t that overstepping my boundaries?\u201dXiaofuzi handed the hot tea over to Pan Rugui. He smiled ingratiatingly and said, \u201cForefather is my master, and so Forefather is my Heaven. Seeing Forefather meditating is just like seeing the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord9\u00a0 descending to the mortal world! How on earth would I give it that much thought?\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201d Pan Rugui rinsed his mouth. \u201cThis filial piety of yours could be called a skill in itself.\u201dXiaofuzi let out a \u201chehe\u201d as he moved close to Pan Rugui\u2019s leg and said, \u201cI have to show my filial respect to Forefather since it\u2019s the Zhengdan Festival. While I was procuring for the Festival before the new year, I saw a stunning beauty in Prince Chu\u2019s Manor! I made some inquiries around. His Majesty can\u2019t use her anyway, so it\u2019s of utmost importance for me to\u00a0 give her to you as a show of my filial piety instead.\u201dPan Rugui said, \u201cHow stunning is she? Can she compare to Third Missy? Furthermore, isn\u2019t that Prince Chu\u2019s woman? Given that overbearing and domineering temper of his, I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t let her go that easily.\u201dXiaofuzi said, \u201cNo matter how noble Prince Chu is, he can\u2019t be even nobler than his Majesty, can he? His Majesty didn\u2019t even say anything, so isn\u2019t it only right for me to present her to Forefather? Besides, you don\u2019t have to worry about this matter. I assure you that all the proper arrangements will be made before the beginning of Spring. It\u2019ll be her good fortune when the time comes for you to lay your eyes on her regardless of whether or not you accept her.\u201dPan Rugui set aside the teacup and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. I\u2019m not an avaricious or a lecherous man. Since you brought up Prince Chu, then how is the one who has the same temper as him, Mister-Muddling-Along Second Young Master Xiao, doing lately?\u201dXiaofuzi pounded Pan Rugui\u2019s thigh in a massage and said, \u201cHeh! Forefather, this Second Young Master Xiao is really a legend. From the first night since he came to the Capital, he has been out drinking with the others! He has never done any serious work except to drink and make merry. Prince Chu and that clique of his all like to have fun with him. Birds of a feather truly flock together!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine\u2026 but he is still a member of the Xiao Clan after all. His Majesty placed him in the Imperial Regalia Service, which is too close for comfort. It makes me uneasy.\u201d Pan Rugui thought about it for a moment, then suddenly smiled and said, \u201cI have thought of just the perfect place to send him away to. Put on my shoes. I\u2019m going to Mingli Hall to serve His Majesty!\u201dIt was the Zhengdan Festival\u2019s \u2018Banquet of Ten Thousand Officials\u2019 the next day. There was nothing much going on during the feast, and just as the banquet was about to break up, they all heard Emperor Xiande say.\u201cA-Ye, has it been comfortable for you in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0these days?\u201dXiao Chiye stopped peeling the tangerine and answered, \u201cTo reply Your Majesty, it\u2019s comfortable.\u201dEmperor Xiande turned towards Xiao Jiming and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it. Putting A-Ye in the Imperial Regalia Service is a waste of talent. He\u2019s a good child who has been on the battlefield. Keeping him before me is too much of an aggrievement for him. How about this? Let A-Ye go to the\u00a0Imperial Army. The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0Viceroy10\u00a0used to be Xi Gu\u2019an, but he now has the Eight Great Training Divisions to manage. He is really up to his ears in work. Let A-Ye take his place.\u201dRight at once, Lu Guangbai frowned.At the very least, the Imperial Regalia Service would be on duty before the Emperor. If anything were to happen, His Majesty could not turn a blind eye to it. But what good was the\u00a0Imperial Army? The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0was now the errand-runners of\u00a0Qudu. Was this a reward? How could this even be considered a reward?!Lu Guangbai was about to rise to his feet when he saw that Xiao Chiye had already bowed his thanks.\u201cA Viceroy sounds imposing, just like a Commander-in-Chief.\u201d Xiao Chiye smiled frivolously and said, \u201cThank you, Your Majesty!\u201dSecretariat Elder Hua laughed out loud and said, \u201cHis Majesty is wise!\u00a0Hereditary Prince, here\u2019s a young hero in the making.\u201dThe sounds of congratulations rose and fell like the tide during the banquet. Xiao Jiming smiled and said nothing as he looked at Xiao Chiye.Lu Guangbai drank the wine and lowered his head to say to Zhao Hui at the side. \u201c\u2026 Such an arrangement is clearly a death sentence aimed at Jiming\u2019s heart.\u201dAfter the banquet broke up, Xiao Chiye disappeared without a trace.His rowdy bunch of friends wanted to congratulate him on his promotion. So he took them drinking. When they reemerged at midnight after drinking, they were all staggering on their feet.Prince Chu, Li Jianheng, was a few years older than Xiao Chiye. He was a true scoundrel. Before getting into the sedan chair, he even tugged at Xiao Chiye\u2019s sleeve and said in a drunken stupor, \u201cHow capable of you! The\u00a0Imperial Army, huh. You need not bother about patrols or defenses. It\u2019s a very idle job, and yet you still get to collect a salary. You get the money, and you don\u2019t have to put your life on the line. All the best things in the world have fallen into your lap! You must be secretly smug!\u201dXiao Chiye smiled too; it was even a wicked smile. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s why I lose no time in inviting you for a drink. Together in the future, we\u2019ll run amok in\u00a0Qudu!\u201d\u201cRight, right!\u201d Li Jianheng patted Xiao Chiye vigorously on his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit! Come to my residence a few days later. I\u2019ll get them to\u2026 celebrate for you again\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye watched the sedan move away into the distance and flipped atop his horse. He had personally trained and tamed his horse \u2013 the offspring of wild horses \u2013 at the foot of the Hongyan Mountain Ranges. It was a swift and brave divine steed that was black all over except for a patch of white on its chest.Xiao Chiye clapped his horse forward. The stores on both sides of the street were about to light the lanterns to send him off. He raised his hand and said, \u201cPut them out. Don\u2019t illuminate them.\u201dThe stores\u2019 attendants looked at each other, but they did not dare to disobey him. The lanterns went out one by one until there was only the dim glow of the frosty moon and icy snow on the road.Xiao Chiye whistled, and the gyrfalcon swooped down from the darkness of the night amid the whistling of the wind. He then hit the horse to spur it on. The steed under his saddle snorted out a puff of hot air and broke into a sudden dash.The strong wind launched a frenzied assault against Xiao Chiye, dissipating the hot flushes he had from drinking. In the darkness, he looked like a cornered beast on a rampage. The sounds of hooves became the massive crashes of collisions. He galloped through the deserted streets. The darkness ripped his smiling face away until all that remained was a cold and lonely silence.The steed had been running for an unknown period of time when Xiao Chiye suddenly tumbled off it. He crashed heavily into the pile of snow and remained there with his head lowered for a moment.The horse raised its hooves and trotted around him before it lowered its head to nudge him. The gyrfalcon remained perched on the back of the horse and tilted its head to look askance at him.Xiao Chiye endured it for a moment, then propped himself up with his arms and vomited. After a long time, he stood up and leaned against the wall. The bone thumb ring on his thumb was a little large and had fallen off somewhere. He searched for it in the snow, but then he heard someone whispering a question a short distance away. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dXiao Chiye ignored him.The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0Squad Commander felt for his lantern to shine at him and said, \u201cHow dare you\u2026 Your Excellency?\u201dXiao Chiye turned his head and asked, \u201cKnow me?\u201dThe\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0Squad Commander shook his head honestly. \u201cI don\u2019t know which of the Lords you are\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m your big brother.\u201d Xiao Chiye cast away the dirtied cloak and lowered his eyes to continue looking for the thumb ring. He cussed in irritation under his breath and said, \u201cGive me the lantern. You can scram.\u201dThe\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0Squad Commander cautiously came nearer and said, \u201cYou are Second Young Master, right? We have just received the order. It\u2019s still dark, and it\u2019s too early for an investigation. There\u2019s still time if you come again tomorrow\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye held out his hand, and the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0Squad Commander handed the lantern over to him. Xiao Chiye asked, \u201cWhat is this place?\u201dThe\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0Squad Commander respectfully replied, \u201cThe perimeter of\u00a0Qudu. Zhao Zui Temple.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cYou may leave.\u201dThe Squad Commander retreated and was about to leave when he heard Xiao Chiye speak. \u201cShen Zechuan is here? Beyond this wall?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d The Squad Commander was getting more and more apprehensive. \u201cHe\u2019s detained in\u2026\u201d\u201cGet him to come out.\u201dThe stunned Squad Commander hastened to say, \u201cHow would that do?! Even if you are the Viceroy, you can\u2019t do that! His Majesty the Emperor strictly commanded\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye lifted the lantern and said, \u201cI have the final say in the\u00a0Imperial Army.\u201dThe Squad Commander said tentatively. \u201cDon\u2019t kill, kill\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fucking telling him to come out and sing me a tune!\u201d Xiao Chiye flung the lantern aside suddenly. The light swiftly went out. He stood in the darkness, his eyes malicious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 : DrunkenXiao Jiming gathered his cloak around him as he stood under the lantern. Zhao Hui stood guard behind him and said, \u201cCounting the hours, he should be back now. The man who went to pick him up said that the Young Master had left by himself on his horse. Why isn\u2019t he here yet?\u201dXiao Jiming let out a breath of cold air and looked at the sky in silence for a moment. He said, \u201cWhenever he\u2019s unhappy in the past, he would go galloping on horseback at the foot of Hongyan Mountains. This habit won\u2019t change.\u201dZhao Hui said, \u201cAt the very least, the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0is a post.\u201dXiao Jiming shifted his gaze and asked, \u201cDo you know what Father regrets the most in his life?\u201dZhao Hui shook his head honestly.Xiao Jiming said, \u201cIt\u2019s that he has fathered A-Ye too late. Three years ago, we were ambushed at the foot of Hongyan Mountains. Before Father\u2019s reinforcements arrived, A-Ye led the twenty members of the cavalry that had been originally assigned to guard him and rode his horse across the Hongjiang River at night. He groped around in the quagmire for half the night and burned Biansha\u2019s grains. When I saw him, he was smelly and dirty all over as he soaked in the water until the wounds on his legs festered. That year, he was only fourteen of age. I asked if he was afraid, and he said that he had a blast of a time. Father often said that the Lu Clan are the eagles of the desert, while the Xiao Clan are the dogs of Libei. I don\u2019t like this choice of phrasing, but we are like chained dogs every time we deploy troops from that time onwards. It\u2019s no longer as satisfying as it was ten over years ago. Battling all these years has long drained the valor in me. The members of the Xiao Clan are not dogs, but the only one left today with the nature of the wolf is A-Ye. What he yearns for in his dreams are the mountains of Libei. And yet, he now has to remain in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0and forget about the freedom of riding horses. Father and I have both let him down.\u201dAfter a moment\u2019s silence, Zhao Hui looked at Xiao Jiming and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0to put yourself down. The Young Master is impetuous by nature and is not the best choice of person to lead and continue the legacy. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s born earlier or later; the reins of Libei must not be handed over to him. The Commander-in-Chief must have the tenacity of one shaped by experience, and a willpower as unwavering as a rock. The Young Master is not up to it.\u201dXiao Jiming did not say a word more.The strong wind that night sent the lanterns swinging ceaselessly. Master and slave waited for a little less than an hour before they saw someone urging the horse on towards them from a distance away.\u201cHereditary Prince!\u201d The man on the horse tumbled off and said, \u201cSomething happened to the Young Master!\u201dZhao Hui immediately held up his blade and said, \u201cWhere is the Young Master?\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8An hour earlier.The Squad Commander shoved a shackled Shen Zechuan down the stairs.\u201cSing.\u201d The Squad Commander egged him on from behind. \u201cQuick, sing a few lines!\u201dShen Zechuan did not utter a word as he looked at the man squatting under the shadows of the wall. His chest hurt the moment he saw the gyrfalcon. He could not help but purse his lips into a tight line as he stood where he was.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cCome over and stand here.\u201dShen Zechuan exhaled a breath of hot air and slowly shuffled forward to stand a short distance away from Xiao Chiye.Xiao Chiye rose to his feet and asked, \u201cWho is your mother?\u201dShen Zechuan replied, \u201cA dancer from Duanzhou.\u201d.\u201cYou know how to sing a tune, right?\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s gaze was so terrifying that it made one flustered. \u201cOld Dog Shen didn\u2019t teach you anything, but someone must have taught you something.\u201dShen Zechuan lowered his head to evade his gaze as if he was afraid of him. He said, \u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to.\u201d\u201cLift your head.\u201d Xiao Chiye pushed aside the lantern with his foot. \u201cOr are you afraid of me?\u201dShen Zechuan could only raise his head. He caught a whiff of wine.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to sing. Find something for me.\u201dShen Zechuan spread out his palms to show that he was still being chained.Xiao Chiye frowned and said, \u201cJust look for it like that.\u201dSo Shen Zechuan squatted down and grabbed a few handfuls of snow.Xiao Chiye stared coldly at the top of his head and said, \u201cStand up again.\u201dSo Shen Zechuan propped himself up with his hands on his knees and stood up.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cYou can squat down and up freely, and your legs are unaffected. Were the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0carrying out the floggings too considerate, or is a worthless life easier to sustain?\u201d\u201cNaturally, it\u2019s because a worthless life is easier to sustain.\u201d Shen Zechuan said in a muffled voice. \u201cHow lucky for me.\u201d\u201cThat makes little sense.\u201d Xiao Chiye pressed his whip against Shen Zechuan\u2019s chest. \u201cThat kick was meant to end this life. Your martial art skills are pretty good.\u201dThis whip gave Shen Zechuan the chills. He cowered from fear and said, \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 hanging on to my last breath. Second Young Master is righteous. Why make life difficult for a nobody like me? This matter has already come to such a point, and I\u2019ve gotten what I deserve. Please let me off.\u201dXiao Chiye asked, \u201cDo you truly mean that?\u201dShen Zechuan had already been reduced to sobs. He nodded his head vigorously.Xiao Chiye retracted the whip and said, \u201cYou can say anything, but who knows whether or not they are true. How about this? Bark a few times like a dog. Once I\u2019m satisfied, I\u2019ll let you off tonight.\u201dShen Zechuan said nothing.The Squad Commander was scared witless by Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes and shoved Shen Zechuan a few times.The color drained from Shen Zechuan\u2019s face as he said timidly, \u201c\u2026 At least let me do it before you alone.\u201d\u201cScram.\u201d Xiao Chiye kept it short and to the point.The Squad Commander instantly felt relieved and said joyously to Shen Zechuan. \u201cScram! Let\u2019s us scram now\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s cutting gaze fell upon the Squad Commander\u2019s face. The Squad Commander went weak in the knees. He pointed to himself and said, \u201cMe, me? Sure\u2026 Sure thing!\u201dGritting his teeth, he curled up into a ball and rolled1\u00a0a few rounds in the snow before standing a short distance away.Shen Zechuan coyly shifted a little closer and whispered into Xiao Chiye\u2019s ear. \u201c\u2026 Even if you let me off, will I let you off?\u201dBits of snow suddenly flew up as Xiao Chiye gripped Shen Zechuan\u2019s arm and pressed it down forcefully. With a sinister expression, he said, \u201cShowing your true colors now, huh. I was wondering what\u2019s with this helpless and pitiful act you are putting on!\u201dBoth men suddenly toppled over onto the snow. With his hands dangling from the handcuffs, Shen Zechuan kicked Xiao Chiye in his lower abdomen and scrambled to prop himself up. \u201cThe imperial decree was for me to be confined. Yet the Xiao Clan dares to defy the imperial edict to take my life. After tonight\u2014\u201dXiao Chiye dragged Shen Zechuan towards him by his shackles.Shen Zechuan knocked hard against the ground and yelled through clenched teeth. \u201c\u2014You are all the Xiao Clan\u2019s accomplices in defying the imperial edict! My death is not to be regretted, but the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0will all die with me tonight!\u201d2Xiao Chiye clutched Shen Zechuan\u2019s throat from behind and forced him to raise his head. He gave a few short laughs and said harshly, \u201cDo you think of yourself as a golden child? Die with you? Are you even worthy?! Killing you is just like pulling weeds!\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s breathing was strained. He suddenly looped his shackles around the nape of Xiao Chiye\u2019s neck and summoned all his strength to wrench the latter to the ground. Xiao Chiye was caught unawares by this move. As he raised his arms, Shen Zechuan kicked him in the chest. Both men instantly tumbled upside down.\u201cKill me like pulling weeds?\u201d Shen Zechuan bent his head and stared into Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes, finally meeting him eye to eye amidst the chaos. He said in a hoarse voice, \u201cYou\u2019ve missed the opportunity. It remains to be seen who will be the hound and who will be the\u00a0jade\u00a0baby rabbit in time to come!\u201d\u201cWhoever dares to help you in secret!\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s intent to kill had been ignited. \u201cI\u2019ll kill one for every one of them I dig out!\u201dThe Squad Commander was scared to death by this sudden change and rushed over to stop them. \u201cYour Excellency! Your Excellency mustn\u2019t kill!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Shen Zechuan snapped. \u201cThe Second Young Master wants to kill me tonight!\u201d\u201cShut your trap!\u201d Xiao Chiye made a sudden move to gag his mouth.Who would have known that Shen Zechuan would open his mouth to clamp his teeth down hard on him? He pressed down on half of Xiao Chiye\u2019s body, having already bitten through the skin and flesh of the web between Xiao Chiye\u2019s thumb and forefinger.Xiao Chiye said in a cold voice, \u201cDo you think you can cover it up by making a scene and acting shamelessly? Your martial arts prowess is by no means average!\u201dThe Squad Commander could not stop them, and so he hurriedly called for help. \u201cPull him off, quick!\u201dBlood was oozing out between Shen Zechuan\u2019s teeth, but still, he refused to let go. Xiao Chiye had already sobered up by now. He grabbed and lifted Shen Zechuan by his back collar and flung him away. The pain in his purlicue was penetrating. Yet it was Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes that were vividly seared into Xiao Chiye\u2019s memory.\u201cYoung Master!\u201d Zhao Hui shouted on horseback.Xiao Chiye turned his head and saw his elder brother on horseback too. The latter had already dismounted and was hurrying towards him. Right at that very instant, he felt ashamed. It was as if someone had peeled him bare of his skin and battered him back into his worthless original self.Xiao Jiming went down on one knee, and Shen Zechuan immediately let go. Xiao Chiye\u2019s purlicue was badly mangled, and the teeth marks on it were deep.\u201cWhy did you fight?\u201d Zhao Hui followed closely behind and saw his wound.\u201cLock him up.\u201d Xiao Jiming said in a deep voice.Zhao Hui picked Shen Zechuan up and headed inside.\u201cThe Young Master is drunk.\u201d Xiao Jiming looked at the Squad Commander and said, \u201cDon\u2019t let what happened tonight get out. I will personally make an apology to His Majesty.\u201dThe Squad Commander kowtowed to him several times and repeated, \u201cI\u2019ll leave the arrangements to the\u00a0Hereditary Prince!\u201dXiao Jiming stood up. Zhao Hui had already thrown the man back into the temple. On seeing this, he said to the Squad Commander, \u201cIt has been hard on our\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0brothers tonight in sending the Young Master back to the residence all safe and sound. It isn\u2019t easy to stand guard on a winter night. I\u2019d like to invite all of you for a drink of hot wine. I hope the various gentlemen will not turn this invitation down.\u201dNot daring to say no, the Squad Commander tactfully agreed.Only then did Xiao Jiming look at Xiao Chiye, although it was in wordless silence.Xiao Chiye did not even wipe away the blood on his hand. He wanted to say something, but then he saw that his elder brother had already turned around to mount the horse.\u201cDage.\u201dXiao Chiye called out to him in a mutter.Xiao Jiming heard him, but he spurred his horse on and left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 : New YearShen Zechuan\u2019s shackles were removed. He moved his wrists as he listened to the Squad Commander grumble on and on. Ji Gang pushed the wheelbarrow and swiftly finished unloading the wine for the\u00a0Imperial Army. With a coarse cloth wrapped around his head, he shifted over to them.After ordering Ji Gang to finish tidying up the courtyard before spring, the Squad Commander went outside again to instruct the squad on guard duty that night not to spread word of the incident.\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Ji Gang pulled Shen Zechuan\u2019s arm.\u201cNo.\u201d Shen Zechuan raised his hand to wipe the nape of his neck, where Xiao Chiye had left strangulation marks. He called out, \u201cShifu.\u201dJi Gang asked, \u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201dShen Zechuan shook his head. He considered it for a moment, then said, \u201cHis external martial arts1\u00a0is strong and fierce, and his fists and kicks are powerful. It feels familiar to me.\u201dJi Gang\u2019s burned and disfigured face looked astonished. He said, \u201cOur Ji Clan Boxing Style has never been imparted to outsiders.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t dare to counter his moves the moment he struck.\u201d The taste of blood seemed to linger in Shen Zechuan\u2019s mouth. He licked the edges of his teeth with the tip of his tongue and thought for a moment. He said, \u201cI was afraid he might get an inkling, so I did not dare to pull out all the stops. It\u2019s just that making a scene and playing dumb could not deceive him either.\u00a0Shifu, why does he hate me so much? Teacher spoke of the current political situation. Aren\u2019t those relatives of the Empress Dowager with her at the lead the ones he should hate the most?\u201d\u201cThat brat is drunk!\u201d Ji Gang said with loathing. \u201cAnd bullies always pick on the weak. So he could only turn to you.\u201dShen Zechuan shook out his left hand. \u201cHe was looking for this. Does\u00a0shifu\u00a0recognize it?\u201dLying quietly on his palm was that aged and worn out bone thumb ring.\u201cThose with impressive arm strength in the army often use large bows and must wear these kinds of thumb rings when they are pulling the bowstring.\u201d Ji Gang scrutinized the thumb ring and said, \u201cThis kind of wear and tear is most likely from drawing the Libei Cavalry\u2019s Great Bow of Heaven. However, this Second Young Master Xiao is not heading into war. So what is he wearing this for?\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xiao Chiye slept in silence. It was Lu Guangbai who woke him up.\u201cYou were really a piece of work last night.\u201d Lu Guangbai did not hold back. He sat on the chair and said, \u201cYou have only just gotten a post, and you have already gone and looked for trouble. I just saw Jiming leaving the residence earlier to head for the palace.\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s throat felt uncomfortable as he lay covered under the quilt. He said, \u201cI drank too much.\u201d\u201cIn a few more days, we will leave the capital.\u201d Lu Guangbai said in all earnestness. \u201cYou can\u2019t continue drinking like this. What are you going to do if you drink until your martial art skills are rendered useless and your body collapses?\u201dXiao Chiye did not reply.Lu Guangbai continued, \u201cThey devastated your elder brother\u2019s heart at the banquet last night, so you should show him some understanding. He is busy with Libei\u2019s military affairs and, at the same time, concerned about your sister-in-law. And now he has to leave you behind here. He feels terrible. A-Ye, who doesn\u2019t speak highly of him before others? But all of them hope that he will never come back again every time he sets off for battle. For these people, he has to lead the troops to the battlefield year after year. He won\u2019t say it himself, but he\u2019s made of flesh and blood. So how would it not hurt him?\u201dXiao Chiye lifted the quilt and let out a long sigh. He said, \u201cDo I not understand all that you have said?\u201d\u201cWhat do you understand?\u201d Lu Guangbai threw the tangerine in his hand at Xiao Chiye and said, \u201cIf you understand, then get up and apologize to your eldest brother.\u201dXiao Chiye caught the tangerine and sat up.Lu Guangbai looked at the bandaged wound on his hand and could not help but laugh. Sitting on the chair, he ate the tangerine and said, \u201cWhy did you provoke him? You just had to go and get yourself bitten before you are satisfied!\u201d\u201cI told him to sing a tune.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cBut he said I wanted his life. How is this guy a pushover?\u201d\u201cYou are no pushover either to start a fight with a confined prisoner on the street. Fortunately, Jiming reached in time. Otherwise, there will be another uproar in the city again today. \u201cLu Guangbai asked, \u201cAre you badly hurt?\u201dXiao Chiye raised his hand for a look and said in irritation, \u201cHe\u2019s born in the year of the dog.\u201d2\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xiao Jiming came back only in the afternoon. Zhao Hui followed behind him and saw Xiao Chiye waiting under the eaves.\u201cDage.\u201d Xiao Chiye called out.Xiao Jiming took off his cloak, and Zhao Hui took it. The maidservant came over, carrying a copper basin in her hands. Xiao Jiming washed his hands and ignored him.Zhao Hui looked back at him and said, \u201cYoung Master, aren\u2019t you going for the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0investigation today? Go get the Viceroy token3\u00a0and come back for dinner tonight.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cI\u2019ll go if my elder brother tells me to.\u201dXiao Jiming wiped his hands and finally looked at him. He said, \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you to go last night, but you still went ahead, didn\u2019t you?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cI ran in the wrong direction. I had meant to return home.\u201dXiao Jiming placed the handkerchief back into the copper basin and said, \u201cGo get the token, then come back for your meal.\u201dOnly then did Xiao Chiye leave.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Since the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0was dismissed from its duty of guarding the capital, the former office had fallen into a state of desolation. Xiao Chiye spurred his horse over and saw several men in short jackets secured with waist sashes sitting around basking in the sun chatting. Their idle and lazy looks had none of the valor one would expect of an \u201carmy\u201d.Xiao Chiye dismounted his horse. Carrying his whip, he strode into the courtyard. There was a bald pine tree standing in the courtyard, with the accumulated snow casually shoved into a heap. No one removed the icicles hanging on the eaves of the veranda, and from the looks of it, the tiles on the rooftop were due for a retiling too.Welp, they were poor.Xiao Chiye continued to scrutinize the surroundings. The paint was already peeling off the plaque. He went down several steps to the main hall. Then, lifting the curtain with his whip, he bent over slightly to enter.The men sitting around the stove cracking peanuts inside immediately turned their heads over to look at Xiao Chiye.Xiao Chiye laid down his horsewhip on the table and lifted over the chair to sit down without standing on ceremony. He said, \u201cSo, everyone\u2019s here.\u201dThe people around him all stood up with a clatter, stepping noisily over those peanut shells under their feet. Most of them were over forty years of age from old military households. Having muddled along in the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0for such a long time, they had no other capability to speak of, except for being adept at acting shamelessly to extort money. Seeing Xiao Chiye now, their gazes sized him up and down before they exchanged sneaky looks at one another with ulterior motives in mind.\u201cSecond Young Master!\u201d One of them wiped his hands on his robe and said with a smile, \u201cWe have been waiting for you to collect the token today!\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cI\u2019m here now, no? Where\u2019s the token?\u201dThe man said smilingly, \u201cWe waited for you this morning, but you didn\u2019t come, and the Ministry of Works were urging us to get to work, so Assistant Commander Cao took the token first to deploy the men. He will be back late. Once he\u2019s back, I\u2019ll send someone to deliver it to your residence.\u201dXiao Chiye returned his smile and said, \u201cAnd you are?\u201dThe man said, \u201cMe? Just call me Lao Chen!4\u00a0I used to be the Company Commander of Dicheng\u2019s Company.5\u00a0Master Hua Shisan recommended me for a promotion, so here I am now in our\u00a0Imperial Army.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d With one hand on the chair\u2019s handle, Xiao Chiye leaned his body to the side and looked at Lao Chen. \u201cRight below the Viceroy should be the Imperial Guards Regional Vice Commander. How did it end up in the hands of an Assistant Commander?\u201d\u201cYou aren\u2019t aware of it but\u2026.\u201d When Lao Chen saw Xiao Chiye listening attentively, his body, which had been bent over in a bow, straightened up imprudently. \u201cThe Zhongbo\u2019s troops were defeated last year, and the grains from Jincheng could not be shipped over. That led to an emergency of food shortage in\u00a0Qudu. The bureaucrats from the Ministry of Personnel could not afford to pay out yearly salary, and so they cut the staff in the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0Office by half. At present, we do not have a Vice Commander. The closest is Assistant Commander Cao. All that\u2019s left are just the few of us.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cAnyone can get their hands on the Viceroy\u2019s waist token?\u201d\u201cOur usual practice in the past was to just take the token and go. The Ministry of Works\u2019s tasks can\u2019t wait, and it\u2019s all lifting lumber to the palace. We are in a humble position, and our words carry little weight. We can\u2019t afford to offend anyone. We don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d Lao Chen started pinning the blame. \u201cIf you think this is against the rules, you have to make it clear to the Ministry of Works.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a legitimate viceroy with a token of authority.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cWhy do I have to explain myself to the Ministry of Works? The one in command above the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0is the Emperor. It was on account of camaraderie that the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0helped the Six Ministries6\u00a0out in the past without settling accounts with them when they wanted our help. But whoever wants manpower from today onwards, if they can\u2019t give a proper explanation of the tasks involved and a clear accounting of the schedules, then they better not count on the deployment of my men.\u201d\u201cYou can say anything you want.\u201d Lao Chen and the others began laughing. He said, \u201cHowever, we aren\u2019t in charge of patrols and defenses now; we are errand-runners and odd-job laborers! We could still prove ourselves useful by helping out at the Six Ministries. Besides, His Majesty the Emperor had never said a word about this over the past few years. Second Young Master, having money in your pocket is not as good as having friends in the imperial court. You lived in Libei in the past, but the situation of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0differs from the Armored Cavalry of Libei. Some things simply won\u2019t work here! Moreover, our\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0is no match for the Eight Great Training Divisions. Who\u2014\u201dXiao Chiye stood up and said, \u201cWho did you say recommended you for a post here?\u201dLao Chen\u2019s expression glowed as he straightened his back. How he itched to repeat it out loud thrice. \u201cMaster Hua Shisan! You know him too? He\u2019s the Empress Dowager\u2019s grandson of common birth. He\u2019s Third Missy Hua\u2019s\u2014\u201dWith a lift of his foot, Xiao Chiye gave him a kick! Lao Chen was still speaking with a glowing face, and the kick caught him off-guard and sent him toppling over and crashing into the table and chair. The teapot smashed onto the ground, splashing tea all over the floor. It startled Lao Chen back to his senses, and he trembled as he crawled and kneeled on the ground.\u201cThe loafer raised by a concubine from the Hua Clan.\u201d Xiao Chiye swept aside the peanut shells on the table. \u201cHe used to carry my boots in the past. What kind of influential backer do you think he is? At best, he\u2019s just a small potato. I want the Viceroy\u2019s token of authority. Instead, you tell me the rules. Are you so blinded that you can\u2019t even tell who I am? From now on, I\u2019m the one who has the final say in the\u00a0Imperial Army!\u201dLao Chen propped himself up with his hands and kowtowed to him. Having received a rude awakening, he hurriedly said, \u201cSecond Young Master, Second Young Master\u2026\u201d\u201cWho the fuck is your Second Young Master?\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes were piercingly cold. \u201cAs the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0Viceroy, I\u2019m your master who is in control of your life. Putting on airs before me and pretending to be some local ruffian? The Ministry of Works needs manpower for manual labor, and the men deployed are all from the\u00a0Imperial Army. If there were no money exchanging hands in between, then would you have found it worthwhile for you to throw yourselves at their feet? Everyone at the bottom is working themselves to their deaths, but you sure have kept yourself fat without lifting a finger. What? Hua Shisan said he would protect you, and you really think of yourself as having the Death-Exemption Golden Token7\u00a0in your possession?!\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare. I wouldn\u2019t dare!\u201d Lao Chen shuffled a few steps on his knees and said, \u201cYour Excellency! This humble servant was spouting nonsense\u2026\u201d\u201cHalf an hour.\u201d8\u00a0Xiao Chiye said. \u201cAuthority token, register of names, and twenty thousand soldiers. I want to check them all. It\u2019s fine if one is missing, you gentlemen can just substitute it with your heads.\u201dLao Chen hurriedly rose to his feet and dashed out.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8The various generals left the capital a few days later. Emperor Xiande led hundreds of officials to send off Xiao Jiming. He coughed intermittently as he held Xiao Jiming by the arms in the heavy snow.\u201cJiming.\u201d Emperor Xiande was wrapped in a cloak, and yet he was still frightfully skinny. He said, \u201cWe can only meet again next year once you leave today. It has been restless over at the Libei frontier. Although the Biansha Cavalry had beaten a withdrawal, they still refused to bow and submit to us. The rapacious ambitions of the Twelve Tribes are crystal clear for all to see. You are my trusted official, and also a valiant general of Dazhou. You must be cautious in everything you do.\u201d\u201cWe came to Your Majesty\u2019s rescue late this time, and yet Your Majesty still showed favor to us. Both Father and this humble servant feel stricken. As long as Your Majesty gives the command in the future, Libei will surely risk life and limb for Your Majesty.\u201d Xiao Jiming said.\u201cEver since your father fell ill, he has not met with me for many years.\u201d Emperor Xiande slowly turned his head back and gazed at masses of human heads within the city gates. Then he looked at the magnificent palace that had towered over\u00a0Qudu\u00a0for a hundred years. He said softly, \u201cI\u2019ve let all the loyal soldiers who have lost their lives on the battlefield down with the way the matter of the surviving member of the Shen Clan played out. But I have been on my sickbed for such a long time, and there are too many matters where my hands are tied.\u201dXiao Jiming followed his gaze. After a while, he said, \u201cThe wind and snow are raging in\u00a0Qudu. Your Majesty, please take care of your health.\u201dEmperor Xiande slowly released his grip on Xiao Jiming\u2019s hand and said, \u201cMy good son, go.\u201dLu Guangbai spurred the horse out of the city. As expected, he saw Xiao Chiye waiting alone at the pavilion at the foot of the mountain. He remained on his horse as he whistled at Xiao Chiye from afar and said, \u201cBrat, we are leaving!\u201dXiao Chiye led the horse and said, \u201cStorms are rife in the\u00a0martial fraternity; a vessel dreads its captain abandoning ship.9\u00a0You must be careful!\u201cJust say it if you have something to say. Why recite a poem?\u201d Lu Guangbai laughed heartily. \u201cJust wait. You will eventually be able to return home one day.\u201d\u201cThat depends on fate.\u201d Xiao Chiye smiled too.The sound of horse hooves rang out behind them. Lu Guangbai looked back. The horse rider coming towards them in the snow was dressed in a simple old robe and had black hair tied up in a high ponytail. Lu Guangbai quickly turned his horse around and shouted, \u201cCommander-in-Chief! Let\u2019s leave together.\u201dQi Zhuyin slowed down. She was dressed light in an overcoat and an old outer robe while carrying a long sword on her back. If one were to look at just her appearance, then she could have been merely an ordinary woman in the\u00a0martial fraternity. It was only after the wind passed that her face crystallized into a surprisingly lovely face.\u201cThat horse of yours is second-rate.\u201d She raised her eyebrows and smiled, instantly showing her might. \u201cIt can\u2019t catch up with mine, can it?\u201dBut Lu Guangbai liked it. He said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t as agile and brave as the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s steed, but it\u2019s a good boy that has survived the battlefield. Let\u2019s have a race, and we\u2019ll find out if it can keep up or not.\u201d\u201cNow, that one over there looks rare to me.\u201d Qi Zhuyin raised her chin at Xiao Chiye. \u201cSwap with me?\u201dXiao Chiye stroked his steed\u2019s mane and said, \u201cNo, thanks. No matter how I look at it, I\u2019m the one losing out.\u201dQi Zhuyin raised her hand and threw an object to Xiao Chiye. Xiao Chiye caught it with both arms. It was an unusually heavy executioner\u2019s blade10\u00a0still in its sheath.\u201cBefore the new year, Libei raised a batch of fine battle steeds for Qidong, and the credits go to you. That thing was forged by the best craftsman in my account books. It cost me a lot of precious materials.\u201d Qi Zhuyin said, \u201cHow about it? Not losing out now, huh.\u201dXiao Chiye weighed it in his hands and laughed. He said, \u201cCommander-in-Chief, from now on, you\u2019re my dear\u00a0jiejie! The blade I\u2019ve brought from home might be good, but it\u2019s too light. It\u2019s not as smooth to wield as this one.\u201dQi Zhuyin said, \u201cJiejie? Wait till you unsheathed the blade, and you\u2019ll be calling me\u00a0yeye!\u201dXiao Chiye asked, \u201cHas this blade been given a name?\u201d\u201cI did think of one.\u201d Qi Zhuyin said, \u201cHe who speaks of the ruthlessness of the wolf is himself insatiable and ruthless.11\u00a0Isn\u2019t that just perfect for you?\u201dBut Lu Guangbai said, \u201cThe word \u2018ruthlessness\u2019 is a little too fierce. He\u2019s just\u2014\u201d\u201cFierce.\u201d Qi Zhuyin flung the horsewhip out with a crack, and the steed under her saddle instantly galloped away. Without looking back, she said, \u201cWhat you\u2019d want for a man of Libei is precisely for him to be fierce! \u201dThe main army on the other side had already started moving. The red tassels12\u00a0from the sea of spears of the Qidong Garrison Troops followed closely behind Qi Zhuyin and surged towards the wilderness in the east. Lu Guangbai did not linger. He waved his hand at Xiao Chiye, then spurred his horse on to catch up with them.The next moment, Xiao Chiye could hear the Armored Cavalry stomping across the ground. It almost seemed as if the earth beneath his feet was quaking slightly. Xiao Chiye looked out into the distance and saw his eldest brother in the lead. Like a wave of black tide, the familiar Armored Cavalry of Libei swept across the snowy plains and galloped north.The gyrfalcon broke through the wind to chase after them. It hovered in the air over the Armored Cavalry of Libei and screeched. Xiao Chiye stood clenching his blade, watching on as the Armored Cavalry of Libei vanished amidst the boundless sea of snow.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan\u2019s mind was wandering, and Grand Mentor Qi knocked him back to his senses.\u201cNow that the various generals have returned to their positions,\u00a0Qudu\u00a0has once again lapsed back into a stage of impasse.\u201d With his hair all disheveled, Grand Mentor Qi craned his neck and looked at Shen Zechuan. \u201cYou don\u2019t have much time. You can\u2019t keep on being willing to remain a trapped turtle in a jar!\u201d13\u201cThey are the butcher knife, and I\u2019m the meat on their chopping board.\u201d14\u00a0Shen Zechuan looked up and said, \u201cTeacher, do I really still have a chance to leave this place?\u201d\u201cFortune and misfortune are interdependent. Being confined is not necessarily a bad thing.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi opened the gourd stopper and took a few gulps of wine. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to lay low and bide your time if you remain behind closed doors. You will have plenty of opportunities in the future!\u201dThe palace bell tolled in the distance. The new year had begun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 : Dragon Boat FestivalEighth Year of Xiande.1\u00a0Midsummer.The round-collared robe2\u00a0of the Secretary of the Ministry of Revenue, Wang Xian, was drenched in sweat. He sat uncomfortably on the chair as if he was sitting on pins and needles. It was not the first time he raised his\u00a0wusha\u00a0hat3\u00a0to wipe his sweat.\u201cYour Excellency Xiao.\u201d Wang Xian hemmed and hawed. \u201cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s not that the Ministry of Revenue doesn\u2019t want to allocate the funds to you. It\u2019s just that the expenditure of the treasury has yet to be tallied, and Pan-gonggong\u00a0up there has not given his endorsement. There\u2019s really no way we can allocate you the sum!\u201d\u201cIt takes time to work out the accounts.\u201d Xiao Chiye held up the teacup to take a few sips. \u201cAm I not waiting here now? Take your time.\u201dWang Xian\u2019s throat throbbed. He looked at Xiao Chiye, who was as cool as a cucumber, and at the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0standing still on the veranda outside.\u201cYour Excellency.\u201d Wang Xian said almost pleadingly. \u201cThe weather is hot, and I feel really bad to let the soldiers stand outside. Let me invite the various gentlemen for some cold drinks. The ice in reserves\u2014\u201d\u201cWe have not made any contribution to deserve it.\u201d Xiao Chiye smiled superficially. \u201cOur\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0are sturdy and burly men who deal with manual labor. So what\u2019s the harm in standing for a few hours? Pay it no mind, Your Excellency. Focus on your accounting.\u201dWang Xian grasped the account book. For a long time, he could not bring himself to lower the brush.That had been the beginning of spring, and the Emperor was seriously ill. For this reason, the Empress Dowager instructed men to carry out large-scale construction in the palace to build a temple so that she could chant the scriptures to accumulate blessings for him. The Ministry of Works, having received this assignment, had to receive large quantities of lumber from Duanzhou. To save money, they ordered the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0to transport them. The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0transported the lumber into\u00a0Qudu, but the Empress Dowager withdrew her plan to build the temple upon receiving Secretariat Elder Hai\u2019s memorial against it. The Ministry of Works was thus short of this sum of money on hand. For two months, they had dragged this matter on, delaying settlement of payment to the\u00a0Imperial Army.Money was in short supply. If this had been a time where the state treasury was full, then this matter would not have been an issue at all. Who would be willing to offend Second Young Master Xiao for such a small sum? But right now, the Ministry of Revenue was suffering themselves. Last year, they had spent almost a million for the Empress Dowager\u2019s birthday just by hosting the banquet and giving out monetary rewards alone.Wang Xian set aside his brush. He might as well stick his neck out. He said, \u201cYour Excellency, there\u2019s no way the money can be settled now. To tell you frankly, the expenditure at the end of the year doesn\u2019t match up to our budget going by the current accounting. Even our salaries might not necessarily get paid out. We really have no money. Even if you give me, Wang Shoucheng,4\u00a0a stab today, there\u2019s still nothing I can do!\u201d\u201cThe salaries and provisions of the Eight Great Training Divisions are paid out as usual without delay. But when it comes to our\u00a0Imperial Army, you are always desperately broke. We are all officials serving the Emperor.\u00a0 It serves me, Xiao Ce\u2019an,5\u00a0right to be so lowly that all I can do is to hold on to this debt and wait for you guys to have enough money to pay us.\u201d Xiao Chiye threw the teacup onto the table with a \u201cclatter\u201d. \u201cThe Ministry of Revenue cries about being poor every year. But what has it got to do with me? Pay up, and we\u2019ll work. It\u2019s all down in black and white. Once we are done with our tasks, you have to settle the payment. Don\u2019t talk to me about anything else; those aren\u2019t my responsibility. If all the problems of the Ministry of Revenue have to bank on the understanding of others, then what else is there for you people to do? Vacate the position earlier and let someone else take over.\u201dHis words turned Wang Xian\u2019s expression livid. Wang Xian stood up and said, \u201cSince we are all serving the Emperor, then why does Your Excellency have to push us into such a tight corner? Who would be unwilling to settle the payment if we have the money? If the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0is so capable, then why do manual labor? Go serve as the Eight Great Training Divisions too! We\u2019ll see who would still not dare to pay up!\u201dJust as the atmosphere was hostile between both parties, a man outside the room lifted his robe and strode in.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for Your Excellency Wang to get angry. The Second Young Master is just being a forthright man speaking his mind.\u201d He took off his\u00a0zheyang\u00a0hat,6\u00a0wiped his hands with a handkerchief, and said, \u201cThis humble one is the Chief Supervising Secretary from the Office of Scrutiny for Revenue,7\u00a0Xue Xiuzhuo. I\u2019m here regarding this account.\u201dThe Chief Supervising Secretary of the Office of Scrutiny for Revenue was merely a seventh-grade8\u00a0position. By all reasonings, it would not even be considered an official in\u00a0Qudu. But it was special. Not only could he supervise the work progresses of the various ministries and\u00a0yamen, he could also participate in the reviews and appraisals of the officials\u2019 virtuous achievements that took place every six years at\u00a0Qudu\u2019s\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau.9\u00a0Furthermore, he could sidestep the Six Ministries to submit a memorial directly to the Emperor himself.Wang Xian could not afford to offend him, so he swallowed his anger and rolled along with it. He said, \u201cHow would I dare to get angry? The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0has done so much. I myself wouldn\u2019t want His Excellency Xiao to have worked for nothing. But Yanqing, take a look at this account. The Ministry of Revenue can\u2019t afford the funds at all.\u201dXue Xiuzhuo\u2019s courtesy name10\u00a0was Yanqing, and he looked particularly scholarly and refined. Without looking at the accounts, he said to both men, \u201cI\u2019m aware of the Ministry of Revenue\u2019s difficulties. Second Young Master, how about this? Quancheng supplied us with a batch of silk a few days back. We\u2019ll have it converted into cash and settle your account with the same number of silk. Does that work for you?\u201dAs soon as Xiao Chiye left, Wang Xian\u2019s expression turned cold. He said to Xue Xiuzhuo, \u201cIs he even asking money for the\u00a0Imperial Army? More like he\u2019s taking it for himself to squander away. Ever since this Second Young Master took up the post of\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0Viceroy, he has been leading a life of debauchery all day long. Every time, he coerces us into a corner. He\u2019s not in the least bit sympathetic!\u201dXue Xiuzhuo smiled and said nothing to continue the conversation.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xiao Chiye left the Ministry of Revenue office and mounted his horse to head for Donglong Street. He was obviously taller than he was five years ago, and the drive and vigor that could be seen in him in the past has diminished some.Prince Chu, Li Jianheng, had been waiting for him an entire morning. On seeing him, he hurriedly said, \u201cWhere the heck have you been? The anxiety is killing me!\u201d\u201cFooling around.\u201d Xiao Chiye sat down and gulped down the cold drink. On seeing the basin of ice in the inner part of the room, he stretched out his limbs and lay down on the Arhat bed.11\u00a0He said, \u201cThis is so comfortable. It\u2019s so hot outside it makes my head spin. I\u2019m going to sleep for a while.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t do!\u201d Li Jianheng waved his moso-bamboo fan vigorously. With his clothes spread open, he sighed. \u201cWait for me to finish saying my piece before you sleep!\u201dXiao Chiye had been up to something at night, and so he was unbearably tired and sleepy at the moment. He let out an absent-minded \u201chmm\u201d.Li Jianheng took a sip of the iced wine with his pampered, delicate hands and said, \u201cDo you still remember that woman I told you about the last time? It\u2019s the one I kept five years ago in my manor and was prepared to take her as mine. But that son of a bitch, Xiaofuzi, took her to give12\u00a0to Pan Rugui, that castrated bastard!\u201dXiao Chiye uttered an \u201coh\u201d.Li Jianheng said with even more gusto, \u201cA few days ago, I went away to avoid the summer heat and saw her again around the manor! That little lady has kept herself so smooth and tender. She looks even more lovely than she was five years ago. My heart goes into overdrive just by looking at her. How I hate those eunuchs! Thieving son of a bitch wrestled away my love by force and broke up a potentially good marriage. He thinks that\u2019s the end of it? No!\u201dXiao Chiye yawned.Li Jianheng fumed, \u201cAre you my buddy or not? You have to help me think of a way to fix him! We can\u2019t touch Pan Rugui, but Xiaofuzi needs a thrashing!\u201dXiao Chiye was truly tired. He said, \u201cHow? Drag him out of the palace?\u201dLi Jianheng pushed aside the delicate concubine waiting on him and shut his fan. He said, \u201cThe Dragon Boat Festival13\u00a0is around the corner. His Majesty wants to go to Xiyuan14\u00a0to watch the dragon boat race. When the time comes, Pan Rugui will no doubt go along. If he follows, so will Xiaofuzi. When the Directorate of the Imperial Stables are racing horses, we can lure him out and beat him to death!\u201dXiao Chiye seemed to be asleep. Seeing his silence, Li Jianheng said, \u201cCe\u2019an, are you listening?\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t do to beat him to death.\u201d Xiao Chiye said with his eyes shut. \u201cIf Pan Rugui comes to hate you because of this, all you\u2019ll be having in the future is trouble.\u201dResentful, Li Jianheng said, \u201cThen we can at least give him a beating, right? If I don\u2019t vent this anger, I won\u2019t even be able to eat. That said, what\u2019s up with you lately? You always look exhausted. What have you been doing at night? Why did you send away the virgin I picked for you the last time?\u201dXiao Chiye said nothing more as he waved his hand to indicate his awareness of Li Jianheng\u2019s words. There was no bone thumb ring on his thumb, but the teeth marks on the web between the thumb and forefinger had left scars. Li Jianheng went on to speak about something else, but Xiao Chiye turned a deaf ear to it all.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8It was the Dragon Boat Festival a few days later. Emperor Xiande, who had not held court sessions for a long time, braced his sickly body and moved to Xiyuan in an imperial carriage. The imperial concubines accompanying him all donned muslin clothes, while Ji Lei and the Commander-in-chief of the Eight Great Training Divisions, Xi Gu\u2019an, escorted the Emperor. The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0had free time, so they summoned Xiao Chiye over as well.By the time Xiao Chiye arrived, it was already full of people. Emperor Xiande finished sticking in the willow15\u00a0and was waiting for the Directorate of the Imperial Stables to start the horse race. The Court of Imperial Entertainments, which was also part of the retinue, served sticky rice dumplings16\u00a0and pastries near the seat. Li Jianheng stayed on the Prince\u2019s seat and waved his hand at Xiao Chiye.Xiao Chiye threw his horsewhip to Chen Yang behind him and entered his seat while undoing his arm guards.17Still weighing the bamboo fan in his hands today, Li Jianheng said, \u201cWhy are you here only now? The anxiety is killing me!\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cYou\u2019re anxious every day. Are you really alright?\u201dLi Jianheng fanned himself and said, \u201cI\u2019m just used to saying it! Look, see that? Xiaofuzi is serving over there. \u201cXiao Chiye looked and saw Xiaofuzi beaming as he spoke beside Pan Rugui\u2019s ear. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t charge up later. Just get someone to beat him up.\u201dAn hour later, Xiaofuzi stepped at the edge of the latrine pit. He was preparing to relieve himself when everything went black before his eyes as someone threw a sack over him.\u201cEh!\u201d Xiaofuzi shrieked, wanting to shout, but someone dealt him a punch so hard that he saw stars.On seeing the sack, Li Jianheng lifted his robe without demur and kicked him. Xiaofuzi, covered with the sack and gagged, groaned in pain as he writhed on the ground.The race ahead was at its most crucial juncture right this moment, so no one heard the sounds.They beat up Xiaofuzi for a little less than an hour, but before Li Jianheng could vent all his pent-up anger, Chen Yang stopped him. Chen Yang shot a glance at the guards from the Prince\u2019s Residence behind him, and they quickly lifted the sack and darted off.\u201cYour Highness.\u201d Chen Yang said, \u201cHe will die if you continue beating him. Perhaps next time.\u201dLi Jianheng pulled on his robe to adjust it. He took two looks at Chen Yang and asked, \u201cWhere are you going to throw him?\u201d\u201cThe Viceroy has ordered us to throw him in the woods beside the lake. Once the banquet starts later, all the serving eunuchs will pass by, and he will then be freed of his bindings.\u201dLi Jianheng spat at the spot where Xiaofuzi had rolled about earlier and returned to his seat.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8By the time the banquet started, Li Jianheng had already forgotten all about him. Xiao Chiye kept his eyes open as he looked over at Pan Rugui, but he did not see any signs of Xiaofuzi.Li Jianheng picked up the dishes with his chopsticks and said, \u201cMost probably, he found it humiliating and ran back to change his clothes. Eunuchs like them who serve the Emperor fear getting dirty and disdained by their master the most. Do you want to go to my manor a few days later for some fun? I can let you see the little lady too. \u201cXiao Chiye drank the cold tea and said, \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201dLi Jianheng let out a \u201cheh\u201d and said, \u201cYou still want to put on an act before me? You, busy? The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0is almost on the verge of getting disbanded. What\u2019s there to be busy with in such an idle position?\u201d\u201cBusy drinking.\u201d Xiao Chiye laughed too. Those eyes of his stared at the tea in his hand. His side profile looked a tad flippant. \u201cOnce autumn arrives, it\u2019ll be the inspection. It\u2019s only by treating others to some wine that I can secure this idle position.\u201d\u201cBeing human,\u201d Li Jianheng pointed at him with his chopsticks and said, \u201cis to treat yourself as if you are living a life of luxury and to live life as if you are whiling the time away. What did they say about the Pan Rugui and those relatives of the Empress Dowager? Aren\u2019t they tired of fighting one another to the death? What\u2019s the joy in that?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s smile grew wicked, \u201cIsn\u2019t that just making yourself more stressed and vexed? Having fun is still the most gratifying.\u201dLi Jianheng looked at that gaze of his and smiled too. He said, \u201cSo what\u2019s with the\u00a0Censorate? Who dares to deny my buddy his post? You were personally appointed by His Majesty. We are loafing around on imperial orders. How about this? Before autumn, I\u2019ll host a flower appreciation feast at my residence. You go ahead and invite them all.\u201d\u201cNo hurry.\u201d Xiao Chiye surveyed Xiyuan and saw the Hall of Zhao Zui Temple at the corner of the rising and falling tiers of eaves. He frowned and said, \u201cThis place is pretty near to Zhao Zui Temple.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still thinking about it, huh.\u201d Li Jianheng said, \u201cThat thumb ring has been lost for so long.\u201dXiao Chiye stroked his thumb out of habit.\u201cThat last member of the Shen Clan has been locked up for five years, and there has been no news of him. His Majesty has never even asked if he has died or gone insane.\u201d Li Jianheng said, \u201cIf the one imprisoned inside was me, I\u2019d have gone crazy in just half a month, let alone five years.\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s purlicue ached. He had no wish to bring up that man.Just then, the sound of drums rose by the side of the lake. Li Jianheng threw aside his chopsticks and rose to his feet to urge him on. \u201cLet\u2019s go! The dragon boat race. They are certain to bet money on it!\u201dXiao Chiye was about to get up, but then he saw Ji Lei hurried his way through the crowd and leaned over to Pan Rugui to say something to him. Pan Rugui suddenly turned his head over for a fleeting instant. And then he slapped down heavily on the table.Xiao Chiye immediately looked at Chen Yang behind him.Stunned, Chen Yang said, \u201cVice\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d Ji Lei was already kneeling before the Emperor. He spoke in a clear voice. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not possible to go ahead with the dragon boat race. This humble subject led the Imperial Guards on patrol earlier, and we unexpectedly fished out Xiaofuzi, who was on duty in the imperial palace, from the water!\u201dEmperor Xiande coughed violently and Pan Rugui stepped forward to stroke his back. It was only when Emperor Xiande\u2019s coughing eased a little that he asked, \u201cWhat is he doing in the water?\u201dJi Lei raised his head. One could not tell if he was looking at Emperor Xiande or the Empress Dowager. He said in a heavy voice, \u201cHe drowned.\u201dA commotion rose from the entire seat of imperial concubines as they used their silk handkerchiefs to cover their mouths.All at once, Li Jianheng knocked over the teacup on the table. He picked it up in a panic and looked at Xiao Chiye. \u201cI was merely just saying\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 : Little CicadaWithout looking at Li Jianheng, Xiao Chiye righted the lid of the teacup slowly with his fingers. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t fret.\u201dLi Jianheng sat back in his chair, scared out of his wits. He heard the Empress Dowager ask, \u201cHis Majesty the Emperor is here, and the patrol is strict. How could a person drown for no reason?\u201dJi Lei said, \u201cTo reply Your Majesty, this humble subject has already sent someone to take the corpse to await the coroner\u2019s examination. We will know the details soon.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Being chronically sick had laden Emperor Xiande\u2019s brows with an aura of gloom. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me there is something fishy about his death?\u201dJi Lei said, \u201cYour Majesty, he was bruised all over when we fished him out of the water. It\u2019s clear that he had received a beating. Although Xiaofuzi was a court eunuch of the palace, he didn\u2019t hold any important post in the twenty-four\u00a0yamen;1\u00a0he was merely His Majesty\u2019s personal eunuch. If he was tortured before he died, then I\u2019m afraid the murderer might be plotting something major.\u201dSupporting himself on the table, Emperor Xiande stood up and said coldly, \u201cI have only just stepped out of the palace, and already there are people who can\u2019t wait.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d Hai Liangyi stepped out and kneeled to say, \u201cThe Imperial Guards and the Eight Great Training Divisions are on rotation duty with one another today to conduct patrols. If the murderer was really plotting something, how would he have dared to do such a sloppy work of it? Xiaofuzi usually took on the job of leaving the palace to make purchases. It\u2019s not impossible for him to make personal enemies out of others elsewhere.\u201dSecretariat Elder Hua, Hua Siqian, who had been sitting upright without moving, said, \u201cRenshi,2\u00a0you can\u2019t put it that way. A man who dares to strike before His Majesty clearly has no regard for His Majesty and all the officials present. Who among the ordinary commoners outside the palace would have this kind of guts?\u201dXiao Chiye sat still as the gears turned in his mind.At the third quarter of the hour of Wu,3\u00a0Chen Yang had dragged Xiaofuzi into the woods. In just an hour,4\u00a0the eunuchs serving the dishes at the start of the banquet and the Eight Great Training Divisions taking over the patrol would pass by. All those present today were bigwigs. No one would remember everyone who left their seats to change attire, drink tea, or make a trip to the latrine. What\u2019s more, the accompanying soldiers and eunuchs all had the right to move around the garden too. Someone only needed to give Xiaofuzi a light kick in that timespan of an hour, and he would have drowned in the pond.Looking at the situation now, the thorny issue was not explaining how the bruises on Xiaofuzi\u2019s body came about. Instead, it was that Ji Lei had changed the course of investigation and turned this murder case into a suspect case for rebellion.Xiao Chiye tapped his fingertips on the lid.This fire must never burn its way to Prince Chu.The Emperor was gravely ill now, and the Imperial Physician was at his wits\u2019 end. No one could even predict the day of his demise. However, Emperor Xiande had no heirs. Once the unexpected happens, Li Jianheng would be the next one in line to the throne.What happened today was all because he did not think things through. It was too brazen for Li Jianheng to leave his seat. This was something he could not simply dismiss with a perfunctory excuse.The Xiao Clan was treading on thin ice. If they were to be suspected of being implicated in the tussle for the imperial throne again, then the one hundred and twenty thousand military forces of Libei would be the executioner blade on Xiao Jiming\u2019s neck.This matter had come bearing down on him too fast; it was already staring at him right in the face. He could not let it continue burning.Xiao Chiye suddenly flung down the teacup, shattering it. The clear, crisp sound of \u201cclatter\u201d rang out, attracting the sidelong glances of everyone at the banquet.Li Jianheng looked at him in apprehension and said, \u201cCe, Ce\u2019an\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye stood up and strode swiftly towards the Emperor. He kneeled and said in a clear voice, \u201cYour Majesty! This humble subject dare not hide this from you. I was the one who ordered my men to hit him.\u201dEmperor Xiande stared at him and asked, \u201cHe was a court eunuch. What grudge did he have with you that you would be so ruthless to him?\u201dJi Lei also looked askance at him and said, \u201cYour Excellency Xiao, this matter is one of grave importance. You mustn\u2019t take the blame for someone else because of some personal relationship.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, actually.\u201d Xiao Chiye said frivolously. \u201cBesides, this humble subject doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a crime. So what if I beat an insignificant and lowly eunuch to death? I\u2019m a second-grade Viceroy of the Imperial Army. Don\u2019t tell me I still have to put up with this condescending dog of a slave?\u201d\u201cFor the Second Young Master to be this furious,\u201d Hua Siqian said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not just any typical grudge. It\u2019s just that Xiaofuzi normally had no dealings with you. So why are you this furious?\u201d\u201cSecretariat Elder doesn\u2019t know it, but\u2026\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cwhen I rode my horse to the military drill ground a few months ago, this dog\u2019s sedan blocked my way. He looked like a big shot. If he had not lifted the curtain, I\u2019d have thought him to be Pan-gonggong. I rebuked him a few words, and he mouthed off at me. I\u2019m a real man, and yet I was humiliated by a wretched castrated eunuch right there on the street. If it had been someone else, I doubt they would have been able to swallow this humiliation either.\u201dPan Rugui was still waiting on the Emperor at the outer side. The entire banquet of attendees all wiped their sweat for Xiao Chiye when they heard him say \u201ccastrated\u201d.As Emperor Xiande turned it over in his mind, the Empress Dowager said, \u201cEven so, killing at the slightest provocation is not what a gentleman should do.\u201dTheir words seemed to hit Pan Rugui\u2019s sore point. The gray-haired man kneeled with tears in his eyes and said, \u201cSlaves like us are all lowly creatures. How could we be compared to the Second Young Master? Her Majesty is already showing us favor with her compassion. Xiaofuzi had been spoiled so rotten that he didn\u2019t know to observe the etiquette when encountering military officials of the court. Even with the Second Young Master\u2019s advice, he remained unrepentant\u2026 This is all this slave\u2019s fault for being tardy in my teaching of the child!\u201d5He spoke in such a conciliatory and accommodating way. Yet, the law stipulated that eunuchs had to dismount and step back to kneel and kowtow in a greeting whenever they saw a minister or major court official.The Empress Dowager was a staunch Buddhist, so she was displeased with the killing of lives. As such, she said to Emperor Xiande, \u201cThere has been a saying since time immemorial that all men are equal in the eyes of the law. Xiao Chiye is so violent and wild. By all sentiment and reason, we can\u2019t let him off too lightly. Besides, the Xiao Clan are all loyal and upright men. The Prince of Libei sent his son into Qudu to be raised close to Your Majesty. If we indulge him to the extent that he thinks so highly of himself, then I\u2019m afraid that we would have let down the Prince of Libei who has entrusted him to us.\u201dJi Lei was indignant. He was unwilling to let the matter go this easily, so he said, \u201cThe Second Young Master has always been on friendly terms with Prince Chu. Now that he has done such a thing, His Highness\u2014\u201d\u201cThis humble subject still has something to say. I might be the one who beat him up, but I didn\u2019t kill him. Your Majesty, this humble subject originally had the intent to kill him to vent my fury. But when His Highness Prince Chu knew of this matter, he persuaded me against it. This humble subject was the one who ordered the guards today to drag him over and give him a thrashing on the quiet. Who would expect His Highness Prince Chu to get an inkling of what was happening midway and leave his seat to save Xiaofuzi\u2019s life? With His Highness giving counsel at the side, this humble subject would not dare to make His Highness lose face no matter how bold this humble subject may be. So, this humble subject let Xiaofuzi off. As for how he drowned, this humble servant finds it strange too. Who would want to vent my hatred on my behalf and do such an ill-advised thing? Your Excellency Ji.\u201d Xiao Chiye turned to Ji Lei, his eyes faintly gleaming with delight. \u201cThe Imperial Guards are usually meticulous and impeccable in their work. Today, he was lying by the side of the road. Yet he could still dodge the patrol squads and fall into the pond\u2026. Perhaps he was the one himself who could not tell the direction with his head covered and rolled down.\u201dHai Liangyi said, \u201cThat\u2019s true. Such a big man fell into the pond, and the Imperial Guards never realized it even though they were coming and going on patrol. If assassins were to infiltrate Xiyuan today, the Imperial Guards probably wouldn\u2019t even notice it either!\u201dHow would Ji Lei dare to muddy the water further? He kowtowed in a panic several times and said, \u201cYour Majesty! The Imperial Guards can\u2019t do anything about it either. The Imperial Guards rotate with the Eight Great Training Division today to conduct patrols, so we have to organize the manpower carefully when relieving each squad. We wouldn\u2019t dare to neglect even the tiniest detail!\u201dThe Seal-holding Commander-in-Chief of the Eight Great Training Divisions, Xi Gu\u2019an, kneeled as well and said, \u201cThat\u2019s indeed the rule. The Eight Great Training Divisions do not dare to make light of it either. The rotation of the patrol follows a fixed schedule. It\u2019s not impossible for someone to memorize it and seize the chance to kill Xiaofuzi. This is a personal feud between a court official and eunuch. It should be handed over to someone to investigate exactly how many people have a grudge against this Xiaofuzi.\u201d\u201cInvestigate.\u201d Emperor Xiande laughed scornfully and suddenly threw the teacup at Gu Xi\u2019an. He said in a towering rage, \u201cSomeone died right under your noses. Instead of self-reflecting, you just want to shirk responsibility! To think I actually put my, my safety in all your hands\u2026 You\u2026\u201dEmperor Xiande\u2019s voice went hoarse as he covered his mouth and started coughing again. He was so enraged that he had to support himself with the table before he toppled over backward.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dThe imperial concubines around him let out shrill cries of alarm. The banquet was thrown into complete chaos.\u201cSummon the Imperial Physician, quick!\u201d The Empress Dowager held on to someone for support and said in reproach.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Li Jianheng looked as if he had seen his own mother when he saw Xiao Chiye again. He said, \u201cMy dear brother! You scared me just now!\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cI have been kneeling for so long that I\u2019m starving now. Bring me some snacks.\u201dLi Jianheng waved his hand to motion for someone to hurry and get the snacks. He stood with Xiao Chiye at the base of the long veranda in Xiyuan and looked at those bright lights in the palace hall.\u201cIf His Majesty regains consciousness, he will summon you.\u201d Li Jianheng said, \u201cHow did that Xiaofuzi die? I\u2019m really down on my luck! \u201cXiao Chiye ate his snacks with herbal tea.It was hard to say with this matter.Pan Rugui has always favored Xiaofuzi. If someone had deliberately wanted to take Xiaofuzi\u2019s life, how could his timing coincide so perfectly with Li Jianheng\u2019s beating? If it wasn\u2019t a deliberate attempt to kill Xiaofuzi, then it was a spur-of-the-moment decision. Yet, it would have been far more advantageous to untie him than to kill him.The thing was that Pan Rugui and Ji Lei reacted way too swiftly. Since the man was already dead, they might as well make full use of him. If they could frame it on Prince Chu, they would be killing two birds with one stone.\u201cHas His Majesty summoned anyone to his chamber recently to spend the night?\u201d6\u00a0Xiao Chiye asked off-handedly.\u201cYeah.\u201d Li Jianheng answered. \u201cThe one he favors the most lately is the lady of the Wei Clan. The Empress Dowager likes her too.\u201dXiao Chiye looked thoughtful.It was already dark by now, but no one dared to leave. All of them stood in small groups on the veranda and waited for Emperor Xiande to regain consciousness.Xi Gu\u2019an left the garden midway. When he returned, he received the Empress Dowager\u2019s orders and headed into the room to wait. After another hour, Xiao Chiye suddenly saw the Eight Great Training Division guards leading an errand-runner, who was dressed in clean cotton clothing, in from the side gate.\u201cWho is that?\u201d Xiao Chiye asked.Li Jianheng craned his neck and said, \u201cAn errand-runner. There aren\u2019t many errand-runners in Xiyuan. But what are they bringing an errand-runner here for?\u201dWith the help of the dim light from the lantern, a sharp-eyed Xiao Chiye saw that the errand-runner had an ugly appearance with burn scars. He did not know why, but his heart suddenly leaped as an ominous speculation took hold in his mind and lingered.\u201cAn errand-runner of Xiyuan.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cXiyuan is a noble ground used to receive the Emperor. It is a requirement for all those who wait upon him to look refined. Where would such a person come from?\u201dAfter a while, Pan Rugui strode out of the door and shouted, \u201cSummon the eighth son of the Shen Clan! Hurry over for an audience with the Emperor!\u201dAn uproar broke out amidst the throng of officials. The sound of discussion rose multifold.There had not been a final judgment on whether Shen Wei had been guilty of treason after his death, but the name of Shen Wei had already spread across the country. The wounds of Zhongbo had yet to heal, and the blame for the defeat of the troops still existed. The fact that the remaining member of the Shen Clan had undeservingly got to keep his life had already roused resentment at the frontiers. So why was he still permitted to come out now?\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d A stunned Li Jianheng said. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me they discovered something? Ce\u2019an, there\u2019s enmity between you and him. Both of you see red whenever you meet. For the sake of the Xiao Clan\u2019s face, they shouldn\u2019t have let him out!\u201dXiao Chiye said nothing. He merely shifted his gaze to the entrance and stared at it closely.In less than half an hour, the guard at the lead strode in. A man followed not far behind him.After five years, this man\u2019s hair has grown long. It hung behind him, secured with a crude wooden hairpin. He did not wear a crown. His old wide-sleeved robe sheltered his wrists from view, while the rest that extended out of those sleeves were as fair and lustrous as that of white porcelain. The lantern obstructed Xiao Chiye\u2019s sight. When the man walked out, the teacup in Li Jianheng\u2019s hand tumbled off.Li Jianheng muttered aloud distractedly. \u201cYou never told me this is how he looks like\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s thumb crooked slightly.Shen Zechuan passed through the front of the veranda. At the very instant both of them crossed paths, Xiao Chiye looked at this man with coldness and detachment. Right that split second, he locked gazes with a pair of eyes that held deep memories.These eyes were narrow and long, with the ends raised and curved into thin arches. Divine light shone in them. Even under the dim light of the lantern, those eyes still looked as if they were hiding the remnant of stars within.In this rush of a moment, Shen Zechuan seemed to let out a hint of a smile at Xiao Chiye. But it was so faint that there were no traces of it left behind after Shen Zechuan brushed past him, much like the wind of the night\u2014thin and cold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 : Praying MantisShen Zechuan followed the man inside and kneeled outside the hanging screen.Emperor Xiande leaned back partially against the head of the bed, while the Empress Dowager sat by the side of the bed. With both hands holding the bowl of medicinal decoction, Pan Rugui retreated a little to reveal Shen Zechuan\u2019s figure.Emperor Xiande made an effort to gather himself and said, \u201cThe patrol squad of the Eight Great Training Divisions said that they saw your errand-runner appear at the side of the pond. I\u2019m asking you, what is he doing there?\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cTo reply His Majesty, Uncle Ge was waiting for Fu-gonggong\u00a0from the palace.\u201d\u201cOn whose orders?\u201dShen Zechuan paused, then kowtowed. He said, \u201cIt was this sinful subject\u2019s.\u201dEmperor Xiande let out a few coughs and said, \u201cYou are being imprisoned in Zhao Zui Temple. Every month, the palace will allocate and deliver food and clothing to you. How would you come to have connections with Xiaofuzi?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty showed concern and allowed this sinful subject to self-reflect at Zhao Zui Temple. Not only did His Majesty bestow kindness upon me, but even grant me food. This sinful subject recently came down with a cold. Coupled with my old ailment, it became increasingly harder for me to get up every day.\u201d Shen Zechuan looked sorrowful at this point. \u201cAlthough the palace deliver my meals, they don\u2019t send medicine. Uncle Ge has been on duty in Zhao Zui Temple for a long time. Taking pity on this sinful subject, he asked Fu-gonggong, who left the palace to procure goods, for some medicine from the palace on behalf of this sinful subject. And that\u2019s how this sinful subject came to entrust Uncle Ge again this time to beseech Fu-gonggong\u00a0to buy some blessing oil lamps1\u00a0for me.\u201d\u201cYou have no family.\u201d The Empress Dowager asked. \u201cWhy do you need oil lamps to pray for blessings?\u201d\u201cThis sinful subject is aware of my heinous sins, so I\u2019ve been praying by the lamp in the temple day and night for His Majesty and Her Majesty. At the same time, I\u2019ve also been chanting sutras all day for the loyal martyrs who lost their lives at the battle of Zhongbo\u2019s Chashi.\u201d Shen Zechuan said devoutly. He continued, \u201cHaving planted some vegetables on the temple\u2019s grounds, this sinful subject entrusted Uncle Ge to sell them for some money at the morning market. The illness of this sinful subject is already in such a state. Instead of using the money to buy medicine, I might as well get some blessing oil lamps.\u201dThe Empress Dowager gave a long sigh. \u201cAlthough you are guilty of sin, it is not unpardonable.\u201dEmperor Xiande wearily closed his eyes and said, \u201cXiaofuzi is now dead. Do you know anyone who has a dispute with him?\u201dShen Zechuan shook his head and said softly, \u201cAlthough this sinful subject might be bold enough to beseech Fu-gonggong\u00a0to buy lamps, I have never seen Fu-gonggong\u00a0before or exchange letters with him.\u201d\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Emperor Xiande motioned to Ji Gang. \u201cTell me. Has he mentioned anything to you?\u201dJi Gang did not dare to look at the Emperor directly in the face. Like any other ordinary errand-runner, he answered with fright and fear. \u201cTo reply Your Majesty, whenever Fu-gonggong\u00a0left the palace, it was all for purchasing purposes. With such a busy schedule, he would usually send those serving him to meet this humble one.\u201dOn hearing this, Emperor Xiande cast a self-mocking glance at Pan Rugui, who stood as still as a wooden statue.Ji Gang went on to say, \u201cBut there was a time when this humble servant greeted Fu-gonggong\u00a0before his sedan and heard him mention something to his attendants about His Highness flying into a rage out of humiliation and wanting to create trouble for him. At that time, this humble servant was anxious to give Fu-gonggong\u00a0the money to buy the oil lamps, and so I moved closer to him. But Fu-gonggong\u00a0was busy that day too, so he told this humble one to come to Xiyuan today to wait for him. That was how the military gentlemen came to see this humble servant pacing up and down by the pond.\u201dPan Rugui said, \u201cDid you hear it correctly? That it was \u2018Your Highness\u2019 and not someone else?\u201dJi Gang kowtowed repeatedly and said, \u201cI dare not deceive His Majesty. Many people saw this humble servant in the market that day. All you have to do is to ask around to know that this humble one isn\u2019t lying.\u201dEmperor Xiande said nothing for a long time. The smell of medicine in the room was heavy. The Empress Dowager covered her nose and mouth with her handkerchief and leaned over to say to Emperor Xiande, \u201cYour Majesty, whether or not Xiaofuzi\u2019s death was premeditated, you can\u2019t just listen to Xiao Chiye\u2019s side of the story. The case happened just a few steps away from Your Majesty. If it was Prince Chu who wanted Xiaofuzi\u2019s life like this person said, then why would Xiao Chiye prevaricate to such an extent?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d Pan Rugui said softly as well, \u201cXiaofuzi\u2019s life is insignificant. Never mind if Prince Chu killed him because of personal grudges. But I\u2019m afraid things are not that simple. His Majesty hardly steps out of the palace, while Xiaofuzi frequently did so. Why didn\u2019t Prince Chu choose some other day? Why did it have to be today?\u201dEmperor Xiande suddenly broke out in a violent coughing fit again. He pushed aside Pan Rugui\u2019s hand and used his own handkerchief to wipe away the bloodstains. Without looking at anyone, he said, \u201cJianheng is my own brother. I understand his temperament best. Since this case is already at this stage, then let Ji Lei settle it. This all happened because Xiaofuzi used his own position to lord it over others and overstepped his boundaries when it came to the rules of propriety, thereby causing resentment and envy among others. Punish Xiao Chiye by grounding him in his residence for half a month, and punish Ji Lei and Xi Gu\u2019an by docking their salaries for three months! Pan Rugui, go relay the message. Once you are done, dismiss them.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Pan Rugui looked at the Empress Dowager.The Empress Dowager said nothing.Thus, Emperor Xiande looked at the Empress Dowager and said earnestly, \u201cImperial Mother, we are currently in troubled times. Autumn is approaching, and the frontier is in a precarious position. Trade conflicts at the frontier are increasing day after day. Libei, Qidong, and the Bianjun Commandery all need to stabilize and maintain the soldiers\u2019 morale. If we pursue this matter, and it ends up implicating too many people and causing casualties at the frontier, then the ones to suffer will be the common folks. Although the pain of Zhongbo has passed, its humiliation has yet to be avenged. Imperial Mother, it\u2019s not advisable to drag this matter on for too long, lest we lose the faith of the commoners.\u201dExpressing concern, the Empress Dowager tucked in the quilt for Emperor Xiande and said, \u201cIt\u2019s truly a blessing for the empire that His Majesty is still worrying about state affairs when His Majesty has yet to recover. Pan Rugui, go.\u201dPan Rugui acknowledged her orders and gingerly retreated out of the door.The Empress Dowager continued. \u201cThe way I see it, this eighth son of the Shen Clan truly wants to repent and mend his ways. He is completely different from Shen Wei. He is a child you can use.\u201dEmperor Xiande said, \u201cHis health isn\u2019t good. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s unable to take on any duties. Maybe it\u2019d be better for him to remain in the temple for recuperation.\u201dHowever, the Empress Dowager slowly put her hand down and said, \u201cWhat His Majesty has said is logical. But he is already out. If we send him back again for no reason, it will inevitably arouse suspicions about the case. Isn\u2019t that contrary to what His Majesty wants?\u201dEmperor Xiande smiled and turned to Shen Zechuan. He said, \u201cThe Empress Dowager likes and thinks highly of you. You must keep this in mind in the future. Don\u2019t go down the same path that disloyal and unfilial father of yours did. Let\u2019s send you to the Imperial Bodyuards then. The Twelve Offices have varying degrees of duties. There will naturally be something you can do.\u201dShen Zechuan prostrated himself and kowtowed to thank the Emperor for his benevolence.After all the others had left, Emperor Xiande leaned over the edge of the bed and vomited out all the medicine he had drunk earlier. The quilt covering his hand had been wrung until it was all creased. Under the dim light of the candles in the room, Emperor Xiande\u2019s face was ashen. His illness was evidently already at the critical stage.With Pan Rugui supporting her, the Empress Dowager walked along the water veranda.2\u00a0Hua Xiangyi held the newly picked lotus in her hands and followed behind them at a distance together with the other maidservants in attendance.\u201cSince his last bout of illness, His Majesty has been acting more and more arbitrarily.\u201d The Empress Dowager strolled and said, \u201cHow can a critically ill person work so hard for the state?\u201d\u201cAs they say, illness comes like an avalanche.\u201d3\u00a0Pan Rugui said, \u201cHis Majesty is getting anxious.\u201d\u201cBack then, when I chose Jianyun, it was because I valued his gentle and refined ways, as well as his deference and submissiveness. Although he has been ill over the years, he could be said to have done his best.\u201d The Empress Dowager looked at Pan Rugui and said, \u201cBut who would anticipate that he would be so fearful of the Xiao Clan? Every time he has to make a choice, he would always prefer not to offend anyone. But how in the world would things always go the way he wishes it to be?\u201d\u201cWhen all is said and done, your orders are the ones we obey when it comes to the matters in\u00a0Qudu.\u201d Pan Rugui said, \u201cWait for a few more days for the Imperial Concubine, Wei-niangniang,4\u00a0to get pregnant with a son, then Your Majesty will no longer need to worry.\u201dThe Empress Dowager turned her hand over and patted Pan Rugui on the arm. She said meaningfully, \u201cBefore Imperial Concubine Wei is with child, we\u2019ll still need you to keep watching over His Majesty\u2019s health.\u201d\u201cEver since receiving Your Majesty\u2019s order,\u201d Pan Rugui responded, \u201cThis slave has been paying attention.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8The people outside had already more or less dispersed by the time Shen Zechuan came out.\u00a0He walked with Ji Gang in a single file down the stairs and saw Xiao Chiye leaving on his horse.\u201cWasn\u2019t the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0written off?\u201d Looking at Xiao Chiye\u2019s waist and legs, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cBut from all appearances, he clearly has not fallen behind on his martial arts.\u201d\u201cAn expert in horseback archery.\u201d Ji Gang squinted his eyes and sized him up for a moment. \u201cBut without exchanging blows with him, I won\u2019t know the extent of the lad\u2019s strength. If he could already draw the Great Bow of Heaven five years ago, then I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s even stronger now. Chuan-er, don\u2019t engage in a fight with him unless absolutely necessary.\u201dShen Zechuan did not answer. But he was taken by surprise when the man who was about to turn the corner suddenly reined in his horse and turned back to charge straight at him.Shen Zechuan looked at Xiao Chiye without dodging or giving way. When Xiao Chiye\u2019s horse was right before him, it suddenly brushed past him. Shen Zechuan\u2019s sleeves and robe went fluttering from the gush of wind, falling back down after a moment.\u201cWhat does this case have to do with you?\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s horse circled around Shen Zechuan.\u201cIt has nothing to do with me.\u201d Shen Zechuan smiled at him again. \u201cBut it has a great deal to do with the Second Young Master.\u201d\u201dPan Rugui lost his lapdog, and I took a tumble. No one benefits from it today, and yet you get to reap from it.\u201d Xiao Chiye leaned over from his horse and looked at him. \u201cHow does someone who is a tough cookie still get to be so lucky?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all by virtue of the Second Young Master\u2019s noble aura.\u201d Shen Zechuan also looked at him and said with humility, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the move the Second Young Master made, then how would I have made it out?\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s eyes were cold. He said, \u201cYou are well-informed.\u201d\u201cJust a cheap little trick.\u201d Shen Zechuan said.Xiao Chiye looked at the sky. The gyrfalcon had caught a sparrow back and was hovering in the air to seek its reward.\u201cThere\u2019s no harm in letting you out.\u201d Xiao Chiye whistled, and the gyrfalcon immediately landed on the tile. It stepped on the sparrow and tore it apart. He looked at Shen Zechuan again. \u201cQudu\u00a0is so big. One has to find entertainment somehow.\u201d\u201cA noble is truly a noble.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cEven the entertainment you seek differs from others. Dining, wining, whoring, and gambling are all beneath your notice. You just had to have your fun with people. However, having fun alone isn\u2019t as good as having fun together. How boring would it be if I\u2019m the only one accompanying you?\u201d\u201cLook at you.\u201d Xiao Chiye grasped the horsewhip and lifted the corners of his mouth. \u201cYou are such a delight. Why would I want others to butt in between us?\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cThat would be too much for me to bear. I have even found so many friends for the Second Young Master.\u201d\u201cBetter worry about yourself than worry about me.\u201d Xiao Chiye retracted his gaze. \u201cThere are good career prospects in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, and Ji Lei thinks so highly of you. I\u2019m sure he will be looking forward to your presence.\u201dShen Zechuan chuckled aloud. He looked at Xiao Chiye with smiling eyes and said in a gentle tone, \u201cYou and I are but birds in a cage. I may have good future prospects, but aren\u2019t you having it easy too? I have no worries and concerns, and being all alone, I\u2019m free from constraints. But Second Young Master, can you do the same?\u201dAgainst the backdrop of hanging lanterns on both sides, Shen Zechuan looked increasingly pretty, like that of jade. The gyrfalcon finished feeding on flesh and blood and landed back onto Xiao Chiye\u2019s shoulder.\u201cSince we are all caged birds,\u201d Xiao Chiye flicked away the dust on the gyrfalcon\u2019s feathers. \u201cThen why pretend to be carefree?\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan returned to the temple at night. Once he took his medicine, he sat across Grand Mentor Qi in the courtyard with a small table between them.Ji Gang had built a small courtyard in Zhao Zui Temple and acceded to Grand Mentor Qi\u2019s request to plant some bamboo and set up a vegetable garden. It was truly a refreshing experience to be sitting outside on a summer night.\u201cHis Majesty has no wish to pursue the matter.\u201d She Zechuan said, \u201cJust so he could protect Prince Chu. That was why he allowed me out. Teacher truly has incredible foresight.\u201d\u201cIncredible or not, it\u2019s still too early to come to a verdict yet.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi tapped the chess piece on the table and clicked his tongue. He said, \u201cLast time, they said that His Majesty had been so sick since the beginning of the year that he could not get up. He is now in the prime of his life, and there is the Imperial Academy of Medicine to take care of him. And yet he is even weaker now than he was in his former residence.5\u00a0It may well be said that Pan Rugui deserves the credit for this.\u201dJi Gang squatted at the entrance grinding a stone. He said, \u201cHis fury was most likely directed at them. Even Ji Lei was punished with them. Obviously, he has been harboring hatred against them for a long time.\u201d\u201cIf one feels that time is running out for him, then he will grow bolder.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi said, \u201cAll along, he has been an Emperor who spends his entire life making concessions for the sake of overall interest.\u201d\u201cThe Empress Dowager doesn\u2019t like Prince Chu, but there is only Prince Chu left to ascend to the throne. Today, Ji Lei kept incriminating Prince Chu. If this was because Pan Rugui put him up to it,\u201d The bitterness of the medicine lingered in Shen Zechuan\u2019s mouth. He scrunched up his forehead and said, \u201cThen, I\u2019d believe it. Since Pan Rugui has the intent to send Prince Chu to his doom, it must be because he no longer has any concerns about future consequences. There is another heir in the palace. One who is far easier to manipulate than Prince Chu.\u201d\u201cThe former Emperor exercising self-restraint?\u201d Ji Gang blew away the dust and said, \u201cI seriously doubt that. Furthermore, if there is really an heir, how would they have been able to hide him all these years? \u201c\u201cAs long as the Li blood runs in him, he\u2019s the imperial heir.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi knocked the chess piece and said, \u201cThe former Emperor might not have one, but can\u2019t the current one beget another? Once his harem gives birth to an heir, and he breathes his last, then the Empress Dowager will be able to carry the baby in her arms to hold court and administer affairs of the state without even hanging up the bead curtain.6\u00a0When the time comes, they can appoint Hua Siqian as the minister in custody of the infant. By then, Dazhou will truly take on the surname Hua.\u201d7\u201cBut Xiao Chiye is on good terms with Prince Chu, and the Xiao Clan has everything to gain and nothing to lose if Prince Chu ascends to the throne.\u201d Shen Zechuan stroked his chess piece. \u201cLibei will not simply sit idle and do nothing. As long as Prince Chu is still alive, Xiao Jiming and Liu Guangbai from the Bianjun Commandery can command their troops to storm\u00a0Qudu. How could the Eight Great Training Divisions afford to fight this battle?\u201dGrand Mentor Qi pressed down on the small table with his elbows and scratched his messy hair. He said, \u201cLanzhou,8\u00a0how muddle-headed are you?! You think the Empress Dowager wouldn\u2019t have thought of that? Then what would they want Xiao Chiye five years ago for? With Xiao Chiye in their hands, Xiao Jiming would not dare to make a rash move.\u00a0Qudu\u2019s Eight Training Divisions can\u2019t win if they come up against Libei\u2019s Armored Cavalry, but what about Qidong\u2019s Garrison Troops? There is no reason for the Qi Clan to get involved in this fight. Just for the sake of the words \u201cloyalty to the sovereign\u201d, Qi Zhuyin would still have to deploy the troops to stop Xiao Jiming.\u201dSeeing Shen Zechuan contemplating it in silence, Ji Gang said, \u201cIsn\u2019t the current Emperor still alive? So why worry about it?! What\u2019s more crucial is tomorrow. Tomorrow, Chuan-er will join the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, right under Ji Lei\u2019s command. I\u2019m worried.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I said I didn\u2019t have incredible foresight!\u201d Grand Mentor Qi said irritably. \u201cHis Majesty assigned Lanzhou to the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0to achieve his own purpose and to acquiesce to Her Majesty\u2019s wish. But does he really not remember who was the one who interrogated Lanzhou in the\u00a0Imperial Prison? What do you think he\u2019s planning by having adversaries come face to face with one another? There\u2019s still something I want to ask you, Ji Gang! When you found Xiaofuzi today, was he really still breathing?\u201dJi Gang wiped the stone with his fingertip. After a moment of silence, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. The timing was too tight for me to take a careful look.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi looked at Shen Zechuan. \u201cThink about it carefully. If Xiaofuzi was already dead before we could lay our hands on him\u2014then who did it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 : OrioleThe next day was the day Shen Zechuan ought to make a trip down to the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0to receive his post. It coincided with the day Xi Gu\u2019an\u2019s younger brother of the same parents, Xi Hongxuan, hosted a banquet. He had invited all the up-and-coming scholars and promising talents in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to have a civilized discourse at the Chaodong Tavern.Xi Hongxuan was an obese man. When he sat down, someone had to attend to him at the side and fan him. Grasping on to a bamboo fan, he said, \u201cThis year is this humble one\u2019s lucky year. Although I did not get to invite Yanqing1, I managed to invite Yuanzhuo!\u201dXue Xiuzhuo had to attend to his official duties, so he could not make it this day. The \u201cYuanzhuo\u201d Xi Hongxuan mentioned was the current Secretariat Elder\u2019s, Hai Liangyi, beloved disciple\u2014Yao Wenyu. These three men could address each other with such familiarity as they were all from the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0and had forged a friendship since childhood.Just then, the bead curtain was lifted, and in walked an elegant scholar as gentle and as pure as jade. He was dressed in a raven blue, wide-sleeved robe with slanting collars, along with a\u00a0zhaowen\u00a0bag2\u00a0hanging on his waist. On hearing that, he merely smiled. The various Confucian scholars3\u00a0at the feast rose in a welcome. For a moment, the sounds of conventional greetings being exchanged rang out.Yao Wenyu said his greeting to them one at a time. It was only after he invited everyone to take their seats that he sat down and responded, \u201cWe meet every year. How am I worthy of the two words, \u2018rare presence\u2019?\u201dAs humble as he was, none of those present dared to belittle him. Because Yao Wenyu was the child prodigy of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0in his early years. He composed poems at eight years of age, and eulogies4\u00a0and proses5\u00a0at twelve. He was the \u201cjade\u201d the Old Master of the Yao Clan held in his palms. In order not to let his talents wane, he took Hai Liangyi as his teacher. Hai Liangyi was, by nature, inflexible and stern. To this day, he only had this one student\u2014one that he prized greatly.After the small talk, they began to discuss the current situation.Xi Hongxuan waved his hand to signify to his attendant to stop fanning him and said, \u201cThere is indeed something strange going on lately in\u00a0Qudu. I wonder if the various brothers still remember the Prince of Jianxing, Shen Wei, who set himself on fire for fear of punishment five years ago?\u201d\u201cThe vile man who colluded with the enemies and cowered without fighting!\u201d One of them seated in the row straightened up and said, \u201cHe should have been beheaded under the law. Even executing his entire clan wouldn\u2019t be too much. It is regrettable that His Majesty is so benevolent that he just had to spare the life of that last remaining member of the Shen Clan. This morning, I heard that he had been released. The evidence for Shen Wei\u2019s crime is conclusive. As the son of a criminal-official whose troops had suffered a defeat, how could he take up a post? How do they expect the virtuous talents from all over to accept this?!\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201d Xi Hongxuan said, \u201cHow is this going to work out? There has never been such a precedent before.\u201d\u201cMost likely, it\u2019s Her Majesty who wants to protect him.\u201d Someone else said, \u201cI have long heard that this remaining member has some relationship with the Hua Clan. But how could personal relationships prevail over state laws? Isn\u2019t this a violation of the law itself?\u201dXi Hongxuan sighed, heavy-hearted. \u201cI\u2019m afraid this will set a precedent that will give all the future heirs of officials guilty of crimes a loophole to exploit.\u201dThis immediately stirred up the Confucian scholars. Owing to the severity of Shen Wei\u2019s crimes, they could not allow Shen Zechuan to be released.\u201cWhat does Yuanzhuo think?\u201dYao Wenyu drank his tea and said amiably, \u201cI haven\u2019t been in the capital for a long time, so I am not aware of the details. I\u2019m not in the position to say a word.\u201dXi Hongxuan said in understanding, \u201cThat\u2019s right. You are often away for studies, so you aren\u2019t aware of what\u2019s happening in\u00a0Qudu.\u201dSomeone among them spoke, \u201cAll of us here are learned men who are widely read in the classics and literature. We are all men with a sense of honor and shame, and we are all well-acquainted with the law. We mustn\u2019t simply sit and do nothing.\u201dXi Hongxuan said, \u201cThen, what should we do?\u201dThat person answered, \u201cWe are all students of the Imperial College.6\u00a0If the public sentiment is roused, then His Majesty would have to reconsider it. Why not let us return and kneel together before Mingli Hall to beseech His Majesty to retract his order and punish the remaining member of the Shen Clan severely?!\u201dSounds of assent rose among those at the feast. Xi Hongxuan clapped his hands and said in commendation, \u201cExcellent! All of you here are indeed the pillars of the country. You will be remembered throughout the ages for this kneel today! This humble one is ashamed. Although I\u2019m not a student of the Imperial College, I\u2019m still willing to join all of you.\u201dThe Confucian scholar who had spoken earlier said, \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t do. Brother Hongxuan\u2019s elder brother is the Seal-holding Commander-in-Chief of the Eight Great Training Divisions. If you get implicated in this matter, then you would only stand to lose. Gentlemen, let\u2019s us be the ones to go!\u201dAs the feast came to an end, Yao Wenyu called the shopkeeper to steam some tender and palatable meat dishes. As he waited, he listened to the whisperings of the Confucian scholars who had gone downstairs.\u201cWhat \u2018Yuanzhuo the Unpolished Jade\u2019?7\u00a0Isn\u2019t he just a coward? Look at him earlier. He didn\u2019t even dare to say a word. How can he be compared to Brother Hongxuan\u2019s benevolence?\u201dYao Wenyu sent a pine nut to his mouth and let loose a soundless laugh. However, he did not step out to contend with them. By the time he came out after his meat bun was ready, the scholars had already more or less dispersed.Xi Hongxuan said, \u201cYuanzhuo, shall I give you a lift?\u201d\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d Yao Wenyu lifted the meat in his hand. \u201cI\u2019m heading for Teacher\u2019s residence.\u201dBoth men bid each other farewell. Xi Hongxuan looked at Yao Wenyu\u2019s departing back and sneered for a moment before he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dOn the other side, Shen Zechuan had already arrived at the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019 courtyard. He strode across the threshold and earned himself the gaze from everyone all around. The entire compound of hurrying and busying\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0just had to catch a glimpse at him even when they were just passing by.The one leading the way was Ge Qingqing. He took Shen Zechuan to the duty records room and said, \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are sorted into four groups of men. The first group is selected from civilian households,8\u00a0where their sister is the \u2018female head of household\u20199\u00a0who sweeps10\u00a0in the palace. The brother would then come to the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0and put on a temporary waist token.11\u00a0Although he is exempt from service, he is not paid a salary. An example of this group is Xiaowu. The second group are those who have received a recommendation by the palace-gonggong, called \u2018Conferment by Eunuch\u2019s12\u00a0Recommendation\u2019. A case in point is the Commander-in-Chief. The third are those born of military households, with the position inherited. I\u2019m a prime example of this. The fourth group are those with specialized skills and talents in different fields. These are chosen by His Majesty himself irrespective of their backgrounds. This category of men are all very formidable. You will naturally get your chance to meet them in the future.\u201d [1]13As Ge Qingqing spoke, he lifted the hanging screen and informed him, \u201cThis is the place where you need to register in the official records to receive your post.\u201dWhen Shen Zechuan entered, the noise in the records room came to an abrupt halt. All the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0with different attires and different waist tokens turned their heads over. A strange silence descended upon the hall.\u201cShen Zechuan?\u201d The man sitting behind the table with his legs crossed pushed aside the book before him and looked at him. \u201cThat\u2019s you, huh?\u201dShen Zechuan saw him dressed in a flying fish attire.14\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0whose ranks were not of Assistant Regional Commander and above were not allowed to wear this attire. So he gave a slight bow and replied, \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201dThis man\u2019s hair was hanging over his forehead, and his stubble had yet to be tidied. His behavior and bearing were rather unconventional. He touched his chin and smiled. \u201cAs expected of the son of a dancer-courtesan. Shen Wei\u2019s extravagant spending all just to win the smile of the beauty back then had not been in vain. Qingqing, give him the token.\u201dSaying so, he tossed the token on the table that had already been prepared to Ge Qingqing.Ge Qingqing caught the token and handed it to Shen Zechuan. He said, \u201cLanzhou, this is the Judge15\u00a0of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. He made a special trip here today just to deliver the token to you.\u201d\u201cThis humble servant is Qiao Tianya.\u201d Having said that, Qiao Tianya motioned for Shen Zechuan to look at his token.Shen Zechuan turned the waist token over and looked at Qiao Tianya again.Qiao Tianya said, \u201cThe Domesticated Elephants Office, is it? That\u2019s where you will be going. Qingqing will lead you there later. But first, there are some rules I have to tell you. Our\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0tokens are as precious as the tokens from the Eight Great Training Divisions. When you are not on duty on your days off, you have to keep it properly. You cannot lend it out to outsiders. Although everyone is assigned to duties in the Twelve Offices, those aren\u2019t your main job. Our job is to serve His Majesty. We do whatever His Majesty tells us to do. Other than the assignments in the Twelves Office, we also have to take turns to serve as \u2018eyes and ears\u2019. If something major happens, such as our arrest of you five years ago, we will need His Majesty\u2019s \u2018imperial edict\u2019.16\u00a0Only when we have the document and the special tokens for arrests in hand that we can proceed. Allocation for any missions we get will not be decided by me or the Commander-in-Chief. Instead, everyone will \u2018draw lots\u2019 and let the lots decide.\u201d [2]17Ji Gang had briefed Shen Zechuan on this before. So he nodded his head and said nothing.\u201cOne last thing.\u201d Qiao Tianya stood up and looked around everyone in the hall. He said, \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are all of one mind. Once you hang our waist token, you are our brother. All kinds of grudges in the past will disperse with the wind. There will be no secret attempts to frame or make a fool of our own brother. If there is, and you are discovered, then all your tokens will be revoked with your names struck off, and you will all be kicked into the\u00a0Imperial Prison\u00a0to be dealt with severely.\u201dEveryone around them turned their gazes away and focused on their own work.Satisfied, Qiao Tianya turned and said to Shen Zechuan, \u201cYou may go.\u201dShen Zechuan bowed in farewell and followed Ge Qingqing out of the door.\u201cI thought it would be an Imperial Regalia post like the Fan Office.\u201d18\u00a0Ge Qingqing looked at Shen Zechuan and said, \u201cThe Domesticated Elephants Office\u2026 works fine too.\u201d\u201cI have had many conjectures too.\u201d Shen Zechuan smiled and said, \u201cBut I never thought that I\u2019d be going to raise elephants.\u201d\u201cThe Domesticated Steeds Office is currently a good place to be posted to. The golden saddled horses are all raised on behalf of the nobles. It\u2019s easy to get a recommendation for a promotion once you have contacts with them and go on to be on familiar terms with them. As for the Domesticated Elephants Office\u2026\u201d Ge Qingqing had an odd expression on his face. \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s not really an idle job. You even have to attend\u00a0morning court\u00a0sessions.19\u00a0And those batches of elephant lords are really a pain in the ass to serve. But the Commander-in-chief hardly goes there, so it won\u2019t be easy for him to create trouble for you.\u201dThe Domesticated Elephants Office was close to Mingli public road in\u00a0Qudu\u2019s Imperial City, which led right to Kailing River. When the weather was hot, they had to herd the elephants over to the river to drink and bathe. Not only that, during the daily\u00a0morning court\u00a0sessions, they also had to lead six elephants to stand at both sides of the imperial stairs. If there was a major festive court meet, or a hunting extravaganza, then they had to increase the number of elephants. These elephants would not only attend\u00a0morning court\u00a0sessions like the\u00a0morning court\u00a0officials did, but they would also be dismissed from court sessions together with the\u00a0morning court\u00a0officials. But while the\u00a0morning court\u00a0officials would find it a challenge to recuperate if they were to fall ill, the elephants could, since they were just like the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0who took turns to be on duty. [3]20Shen Zechuan had never even raised a dog before, and now they were giving him the impossible challenge of raising elephants. All he could say was that,\u00a0life\u2019s unpredictable.Both men were still on their way when they heard someone running after them.Ge Qingqing looked back and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dThe Imperial Bodyguard who came after them looked at Shen Zechuan and said with a solemn expression, \u201cThe token is suspended. He can\u2019t take up the post today. Return to the records room quickly!\u201dShen Zechuan asked, \u201cIs there a new deployment order from the palace?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no new order from the palace. But three thousand students of the Imperial College are on hunger strike and kneeling in protest to beseech His Majesty to retract his order and to deal with the Shen Clan severely!\u201dGe Qingqing\u2019s countenance changed as he looked at Shen Zechuan.Having been grounded for punishment, Xiao Chiye lay on the couch and flipped through the storytelling script.21\u00a0Even when he heard Chen Yang announce Prince Chu\u2019s arrival, he could not be bothered to get up.\u201cI\u2019m being grounded.\u201d Xiao Chiye ate a fruit without raising his head. \u201cSo why are you swaggering in this brazenly?\u201dLi Jianheng tossed down Xiao Chiye\u2019s viceroy token and said in agitation, \u201cCe\u2019an! Something big has happened!\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s eyelid twitched.Li Jianheng continued, \u201cThree thousand students have kneeled to ask His Majesty to punish Shen Zechuan severely! They kneeled until it was dark and went on a hunger strike to force His Majesty to retract his orders. When His Majesty heard of this during dinner, he was so angry that he collapsed back onto the bed again!\u201dXiao Chiye looked at that waist token and said, \u201cToss it out.\u201d\u201c\u2026 The Eight Great Training Divisions won\u2019t break the students up. So they told me to deliver the token back to you. If the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0can disperse the students tonight, then your score with them will be written off!\u201d Anxious, Li Jianheng stamped his foot and said, \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0can\u2019t do anything else, but isn\u2019t it easy to deal with a few students who don\u2019t even have the strength to truss a chicken? It\u2019s a good thing!\u201dXiao Chiye lifted the book to cover his face. After a moment of silence, he said through clenched teeth, \u201cAnd what a fucking good thing it is.\u201dThe students of the Imperial College were future candidates for the Imperial Court, and they could influence the way the wind blew among the local Confucian scholars. Xi Gu\u2019an knew that they were hot potatoes he could not lay a hand on. If Xiao Chiye really moved these three thousand students today, then the first one to be buried under their brushes and spit in the future would be him!\u201cWhere is Shen Zechuan now?\u201d Xiao Chiye suddenly sat up and asked with his hands on his knees.\u201cI heard that he went to the Imperial Bodyguard\u2019s records room early in the morning.\u201d Li Jianheng looked at him putting on his clothes and followed up with a question, \u201cWhere are we going? Are we going to look for Shen Zechuan?\u201dXiao Chiye went down the stairs where Chen Yang had already prepared his horse. He mounted it and spurred it on to depart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 : RainstormThe wind rose a while later, followed by the fall of rain.Xiao Chiye braved the rain and galloped his horse through it. He arrived at the Imperial College just in time to hear Gao Zhongxiong shouting with his head raised. \u201cAs long as the traitor is not executed, the wrath of the public will not be appeased!\u201dThe students at the back kowtowed and echoed in unison. \u201cAs long as the traitor is not executed, the wrath of the public will not be appeased!\u201dThe rain spattered upon the earth, soaking the students\u2019 robes and hair.Xiao Chiye reined in his horse, and the horse trod its hooves on the same spot. He looked at them for a moment, then said in a loud voice, \u201cWhat have you been doing earlier? If all of you gentlemen here had kneeled to make your case back then when that surviving descendant entered the capital, then he would never have lived to this day.\u201dGao Zhongxiong\u2019s chest heaved. He said, \u201cViceroy, as they say, it\u2019s better late than never. This surviving descendant is still wet behind the ears, and he has yet to spread his wings. As long as His Majesty is willing to retract his order and deal with him severely, it will still be a consolation to all the loyal souls of Zhongbo!\u201d\u201cThere is absolutely no reason to rescind an imperial edict of the\u00a0Son of Heaven.\u201d1\u00a0Xiao Chiye said, \u201cBy kneeling, you are not beseeching His Majesty to revoke his decree, but forcing him into it. The various gentlemen here are all loyal and filial men of the world. There are a hundred ways you can use to make your appeal, so why insist on making such an unwise move?\u201d\u201cYour Excellency.\u201d Gao Zhongxiong looked up. \u201cMen who wield brushes die in remonstrations, while men who wield swords die in battles! If we have to watch helplessly as His Majesty is deceived into handling affairs in such a muddleheaded way, then we might as well spill our blood on the imperial terrace tonight to die for our beliefs!\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cUsing the threat of death at every turn. Is that all civil servants since ancient times are capable of?\u201dThe rain intensified. The students did not budge.Xiao Chiye dismounted and squatted before Gao Zhongxiong. The heavy rain poured like a waterfall. He leaned in and asked, \u201cWho is the instigator?\u201dWith a look of great resolve, Gao Zhongxiong said, \u201cMy loyalty to my sovereign is what drives me!\u201dGiving off the air of a ruffian, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Of course, if you want to protect an outsider, you can. It\u2019s just that your action tonight has implicated all those three thousand fellow students behind you. If the Emperor flies into a rage and turns tonight into a bloodbath, then you will be no different from that last descendant of the Shen Clan\u2014all of you will be sinners condemned through the ages. And this isn\u2019t even the scariest thing. What\u2019s worse is that His Majesty would still be unwilling to rescind his edict even if your head rolls. You persevered in your studies despite the hardships for twelve years, all just to do the dirty work for another?\u201dGao Zhongxiong lifted his arm and wiped away the rainwater on his face. He said, \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is a matter of loyalty and righteousness. It\u2019s completely different from the Shen Clan\u2019s traitorous act! Even if all three thousands of us were to die here tonight, even if our blood were to overflow the imperial terrace, we are doing it all for His Majesty!\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cThe situation now is that the palace has neither withdrawn its order for Shen Zechuan to take up post, nor have they sent out an imperial edict to appease the students. Do you still not understand His Majesty\u2019s intention from this?\u201d\u201cFor each day His Majesty does not retract his decree.\u201d Gao Zhongxiong persisted, \u201cWe will neither eat, rise, nor retreat!\u201dThe thunderstorm rumbled. Xiao Chiye rose to his feet. Chen Yang wanted to hold up an umbrella for him, but he raised his hand to stop him. Rain seeped into his robe. Even the token hanging on his waist was dripping water.\u201cViceroy.\u201d Chen Yang suddenly spoke in a soft voice. \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are here!\u201dXiao Chiye turned his head back in the rain and saw Qiao Tianya arriving on his horse. The latter dismounted and cupped his fists together from afar to pay his obeisances.A sudden commotion rose among the students when they saw the Red Cavalry.2\u201cThis is a knotty issue. It wouldn\u2019t do to trouble the Viceroy over it.\u201d Qiao Tianya held on to his blade and smiled. \u201cOne of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0is the target here. So naturally, the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0should be the one to resolve this ourselves.\u201d\u201cResolve.\u201d Xiao Chiye raised his arm almost thoughtlessly and placed it on Qiao Tianya\u2019s shoulder. He said, \u201cHow does the Judge3\u00a0want to resolve this matter? They are just a bunch of unarmed students; there\u2019s no need to trouble the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0over them.\u201d\u201cThe Emperor is the highest authority in\u00a0Qudu.\u201d Qiao Tianya looked askance at him. \u201cWhoever has the gall to defy His Majesty\u2019s orders are the enemies of the Imperial Bodyguard.\u201dXiao Chiye looked at him right in the eyes. After a moment, both men burst into laughter.\u201cMy man.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cYou are gutsy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s raining hard and cold.\u201d Qiao Tianya tightened his grip on his blade and said, \u201cI\u2019ll send someone to escort you back to your residence.\u201d\u201cI just arrived a moment ago.\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s hand remained on Qian Tianya\u2019s shoulder to hold his\u00a0 arm, which was grasping the hilt of his blade, in place. He was still smiling as he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no harm in staying a little longer.\u201dQiao Tianya said, \u201cThis matter is a difficult one. Why muddy the waters?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cIt\u2019s precisely because it\u2019s tough to handle that we can\u2019t get rid of them all at once. These students are all great minds of the state. None of us can take responsibility for it if there\u2019s one of them less.\u201dThe man dismounting his horse at the back was dressed in a thin, wide-sleeved garment. He did not carry a blade with him. Sandwiched between the pack of\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, he stood out conspicuously like a sore thumb.Qiao Tianya loosened his grip on his blade and shouted, \u201cLanzhou, come here.\u201dShen Zechuan turned around and exchanged glances with Xiao Chiye.Qiao Tianya leisurely shifted Xiao Chiye\u2019s arm away and said, \u201cThe Viceroy\u2019s worry is valid. However, the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0don\u2019t merely know how to bulldoze our way through our jobs. I still have some other arrangements on my end. In a while, the Emperor\u2019s order will arrive\u2026 Oh. Both of you are old friends, aren\u2019t you? Lanzhou, stay here with the Viceroy for a moment. He\u2019s scared.\u201dShen Zechuan gathered his sleeves and looked at the students in the rain.Xiao Chiye took a few glances at him and commented, \u201cYour waist token has been hung up pretty fast.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cThe Second Young Master\u2019s token has been returned pretty fast too.\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s expression was cold, but he smiled and said, \u201cYou may seem to be the target of this matter, but the truth is that the real target is the palace. So how\u2019s it? Because your gains were too little yesterday, you have to stir up trouble the moment you get out of your cage?\u201dShen Zechuan tilted his head slightly and looked at him with pure, kind eyes. He said, \u201cThe Second Young Master thinks too highly of me. Where on earth would I have the capability to stir things up? Since the target is the palace, then wouldn\u2019t the Second Young Master know better than I who currently harbor the most desire to see His Majesty fall out with the Hua Clan?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cI don\u2019t get what you mean. Circuitous stuff is all beyond my understanding.\u201dShen Zechuan smiled at him and said, \u201cWe are old acquaintances; you don\u2019t have to stand on ceremony with me.\u201dXiao Chiye did not answer him. Instead, he offhandedly lifted a finger to flick Shen Zechuan\u2019s waist token. He said, \u201cThe Domesticated Elephants Office is a good place. You must be happy, huh?\u201d\u201cI am.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cIt just happens that I have some experience in taming ferocious beasts.\u201d\u201cNot really an experience.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cThat was a deep conversation between the same kind.\u201d\u201cHow would I dare to call it such?\u201d Shen Zechuan coughed softly and said, \u201cIf the talks break down and I receive yet another kick, then wouldn\u2019t all my previous efforts go to waste?\u201d\u201cUse your teeth then.\u201d Xiao Chiye took the umbrella from Chen Yang\u2019s hand and held it up above his head. At the same time, he blocked Shen Zechuan and said, \u201cYou have a sharp tongue and a smart mouth, don\u2019t you? So what are you afraid of?\u201d\u201cI value my life.\u201d Shen Zechuan sighed as if with emotion. \u201cAs they said, the kindness of a drop of water given in times of need should be repaid multifold with a gushing spring.4\u00a0There is so much more I wish to repay the Second Young Master with.\u201d\u201cHave you gotten the wrong person?\u201d Xiao Chiye scoffed.\u201cThat can\u2019t be.\u201d Shen Zechuan cast a sidelong glance at Xiao Chiye and said calmly to him, \u201cI recognize you.\u201d\u201cFine, then.\u201d Xiao Chiye looked askance at him as well and said, \u201cI want to see how much I owe you too.\u201dThe voices outside the umbrella were cut off. Both men stood shoulder to shoulder, accentuating the height difference between them.\u201cActually, there is no way you can stay out of this matter.\u201d Xiao Chiye gazed at the students in the rain. \u201cIf one dies tonight, there will naturally be someone who will lay the blame on you.\u201d\u201cThere will only be more and not less of the forty thousand souls who have died unjust deaths.\u201d Shen Zechuan played it down. \u201cSince they are afraid of death, then why be someone else\u2019s weapon? Even if someone wants to pin this on me, it doesn\u2019t mean I have to plead guilty, do I?\u201dBoth men fell silent again.Qiao Tianya sat astride under the shed and cracked melon seeds. Seeing as it was almost time, he shook the seeds off his robe and rose to his feet. Sure enough, he saw a sedan chair coming towards them amid the color of the night.The curtain lifted. Unexpectedly, it was Pan Rugui who came.The little eunuch supported Pan Rugui with a hand, while Ji Lei followed at the side holding up an umbrella for him. Wearing a robe with a\u00a0tiger, mugwort, and five poisons5\u00a0mandarin square6\u00a0and a\u00a0yandun\u00a0hat7\u00a0on his head, Pan Rugui let Qiao Tianya lead him to the students.\u201cSuch a heavy downpour.\u201d Qiao Tianya reined in his smile and said, \u201cTo think they actually sent the Director to grace us with your presence.\u201dPan Rugui looked askance at Gao Zhongxiong and asked Qiao Tianya, \u201cHe won\u2019t retreat?\u201dQiao Tianya replied, \u201cScholars are all bull-headed. They are neither enticed by the carrot nor brow-beaten by the stick.\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019m afraid the stick isn\u2019t hard enough.\u201d Pan Rugui had lost his right-handed man yesterday, and he had nowhere to vent all his pent-up anger. With the little eunuch supporting him, he came to stand before Gao Zhongxiong. \u201cYou are all men who are well-read in the classics and literature. How is it that you can\u2019t understand the words \u2018overstepping your authority\u2019? The affairs of the imperial court are to be discussed in the imperial court itself. It is not something brats like you who are still wet behind the ears can influence!\u201dOn seeing this well-known lackey of the \u2018Hua Faction\u2019, Gao Zhongxiong could not help but straighten his back and say, \u201cEvery man has a duty to his country. Since the Imperial College students receive a stipend from the sovereign, then they must serve him loyally! Treacherous toadies abound all around His Majesty now. If we still don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cTreacherous toadies!\u201d Pan Rugui laughed coldly. \u201cWhat a fine way to put it! Who instigated you to slander the imperial court and malign His Majesty?\u201d\u201cA loyal\u2026\u201d\u201cCut the crap.\u201d Pan Rugui suddenly commanded, \u201cYou act upon the instigation of those with sinister motives and publicly defy the imperial decree. You incite your clique to slander the imperial court and the people. If this man goes unpunished, then what\u2019s the use of the law? Men, take him down!\u201dGao Zhongxiong had never expected Pan Rugui to be so daring that he would indiscriminately take others down. He immediately braced himself in the rain and shouted himself hoarse, \u201cWho dares to? I was chosen by His Majesty himself to study at the Imperial College! The villain stands before us, and eunuchs endanger the state! The Empress Dowager wields control over the state affairs and refuses to return governance to its rightful master. The ones who should be taken down are treacherous ministers and traitors like you!\u201d\u201cDrag him away!\u201d Ji Lei immediately said in reproach when he saw Pan Rugui enraged.The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0stepped forward to drag him away. Gao Zhongxiong\u2019s attempt to climb to his feet was thwarted. He raised his arms in the direction of the palace and shouted, \u201cMy death today is truly a remonstration to the death! Since the eunuch wants to kill me, then let him kill! Your Majesty\u2026\u201dQiao Tianya gripped Gao Zhongxiong by the neck. Unable to breathe, the latter struggled and shouted intermittently.\u201cYour Majesty\u2014 The treacherous ministers are in power. Then, what\u2019s the point of loyalty and righteousness?!\u201dXiao Chiye said inwardly to himself,\u00a0oh shit.What happened next was just as he expected. Sorrow and indignation ran high among the three thousand students. Life and death had no place here right this instant as it was forced out by this vehement elegy. Rising to their feet in the rainstorm, the students charged at the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards.\u201cEunuchs endanger the state!\u201d They pulled their\u00a0zhaowen\u00a0bags8\u00a0off their waists and flung them at Pan Rugui. Bitter cries rang out. \u201cTreacherous ministers are in power!\u201dJi Lei hurriedly shielded Pan Rugui and guarded him as he ushered the latter back in a retreat. He chided them furiously, \u201cWhat are you doing? Staging a rebellion?!\u201d\u201cThis is the real traitor to the nation!\u201d The students threw themselves against the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0as the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0held them back. Their fingers almost jabbed Ji Lei\u2019s face, while specks of saliva sprayed towards them. \u201cTraitor! Traitor!\u201dXiao Chiye swiftly tossed the umbrella to Shen Zechuan and hurried down the stairs.Shen Zechuan stood alone on high ground and watched the chaos with cool detachment. Pan Rugui had been shoved back into his sedan, and Ji Lei even lost his shoe in the melee.\u201cStorms are rife in the\u00a0martial fraternity.\u201d From a distance away, Shen Zechuan said softly to Ji Lei, \u201cYour Excellency Ji, what a truly wonderful sight.\u201dA chuckle rose from under the umbrella. He leisurely turned the umbrella and looked at Xiao Chiye\u2019s back.Grand Mentor Qi and Ji Gang were drinking wine and tea under the eaves.Ji Gang drank his tea and said, \u201cWas killing Xiaofuzi a ploy to let Chuan-er out?\u201dGrand Mentor Qi took small sips of the wine as though he could not bear to drink it. He hugged the gourd and said, \u201cWho knows? Make a guess yourself.\u201dJi Gang turned around and said, \u201cNo matter what, his safety is the most important.\u201dGrand Mentor Qi shook the gourd and said, \u201cIt is only by making a risky move that a soldier can take his foe by surprise. You taught him martial arts so that he could stay calm in hours of peril. Sometimes, we have to put safety aside. It is only when you leave no room for maneuver or escape that one will put up a desperate fight for survival and emerge victorious.\u201dJi Gang watched the rain intensify with a worried frown and said, \u201cI have already made proper arrangement for the task you entrusted me with.\u201d\u201cThis is called casting a long line.\u201d9\u00a0Grand Mentor Qi scratched his foot. \u201cIf you don\u2019t let it brave the water for a few years before you haul in the net, then all you will catch are lousy fishes and prawns.10\u00a0 Should there come a day you and I both lose our lives in the midst of this, the arrangement today will be the killer move that will preserve his life.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 : StormIt was in the middle of the night that the Empress Dowager draped her clothes over herself and asked through the bed canopy, \u201cWhat\u2019s that din about?\u201dHua Xiangyi nudged the canopy aside and helped the Empress Dowager out of the incense-scented-and-warmed bedding. She replied in a soft voice, \u201cThe students of the Imperial College want the Emperor to retract his appointment edict.\u201dThe Empress Dowager got up, and the maidservants on both sides quietly lit the lamps and raised the curtains. Hua Xiangyi helped the Empress Dowager to the Arhat bed with a girdled waist, horses\u2019 hooves legs, and plain boards at the sides.1\u00a0A soft cushion and heater were presented together to the Empress Dowager, while fermented milk2\u00a0was warmed up for her.The Empress Dowager stirred the spoon with a light frown on her face, \u201cHow did that happen out of the blue?\u201d She pondered it over for a moment. \u201cThe appointment order was only given yesterday, and they came to stir up a ruckus tonight. Isn\u2019t that way too fast?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s more, the ones creating a commotion are those from the Imperial College.\u201d Hua Xiangyi went along with the Empress Dowager and said, \u201cAuntie,3\u00a0all the literary talents in the world look to the Imperial College. Even the Secretariat Elder himself would find it ill-advised to step in.\u201dThe Empress Dowager scooped up the fermented milk. Although her makeup-less face showed signs of aging, it added character to her looks. She gradually put aside the bowl and leaned back against the cushion to stare at the glazed lampshade. After a short while, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Shen Wei is now notorious for his crime. By all sentiment and logic, the Secretariat Elder cannot come forward to rebuke the students. If the students force His Majesty to rescind his order, then I\u2019ll have to swallow this bitter pill in silence this time.\u201d\u201cAuntie.\u201d Hua Xiangyi said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t His Majesty\u2019s original intent to release Shen Zechuan. Now that he has earned himself the infamy of being \u2018muddle-headed\u2019 for no reason because of this order, I\u2019m afraid it will create a distance between you both.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d The Empress Dowager said, \u201cOnce Imperial Concubine Wei is with child Dazhou will have an heir. The imperial heir is the foundation of the empire. As long as I have the heir in my hands, I\u2019m still the Empress Dowager of Dazhou. His Emperor has long been at odds with me ever since he fell ill. Even if he flies into a rage this time, it\u2019s merely a tantrum thrown during a moment of illness. Let him vent.\u201dAfter his illness, Emperor Xiande gradually stopped going along with the Empress Dowager\u2019s will. Although these were all trivial daily matters, it was already an indication of his dissension. The Empress Dowager had assumed command in the palace with Pan Rugui at her side and Secretariat Elder Hua in the imperial court. If she wanted to ensure the continuation of the burgeoning power and authority of the Hua Clan, then she needed a submissive and obedient Emperor.If Emperor Xiande could no longer fit the role, then all she had to do was to replace him.The sole reason the Empress Dowager did not like Prince Chu, Li Jianheng, was because he had already come of age.4\u00a0He was not a weak child, nor was he a child who had grown up under her. How could such a person, if he were to ascend to the throne, be as obedient as an imperial grandson raised by her?\u201cWhat\u2019s more, the appeal today is a blow to His Majesty\u2019s dignity.\u201d The Empress Dowager said calmly, \u201cThe nine years His Majesty has been on the throne, his food and clothing, as well as all other matters, whether important or trivial, have to go through me. But now, he wants to be an independent and imperious Emperor. For this, he emboldened himself to show goodwill to the Xiao Clan. Not only did he refuse to release Shen Zechuan, he even wanted to protect the Prince Chu. But I understand him. He is outwardly strong and inwardly weak. He fears me. That\u2019s why he always aimed to be on both parties\u2019 good sides. Instead, he appears to be of two minds, and ends up thoroughly offending both parties.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t His Majesty imprison Shen Zechuan for so many years for the sake of the Xiao Clan?\u201d\u201cWhat does imprisonment mean?\u201d The Empress Dowager took Hua Xiangyi\u2019s hand and said soberly. \u201cImprisonment is a reprieve from death. His Majesty thought he did a favor to the Xiao Clan, but he\u2019s really just sowing the seed of disaster. Xiao Jiming lost his younger brother. What Libei wants is for Shen Zechuan to die. As long as Shen Zechuan remains alive, His Majesty will let down all those one hundred and twenty thousand Armored Cavalry who came to his rescue. Think about it. Xiao Jiming worked himself to the bone all to prove that he harbors no thoughts of disloyalty. He even dares to leave his younger brother behind in\u00a0Qudu. He has conducted himself with frankness and sincerity towards His Majesty. Yet, in order not to offend me, His Majesty turned around and dismissed Shen Zechuan\u2019s death penalty and locked him up instead. If Shen Zechuan doesn\u2019t die, he will become the root of trouble. This is the period of the struggle between life and death, and yet His Majesty is still so na\u00efve. And need I mention the incident this time? To protect Prince Chu, His Majesty was not willing to launch a full investigation into Xiaofuzi\u2019s case and consequently cut off Pan Rugui\u2019s subsequent move. At the same time, he\u2019s afraid I\u2019d harbor ill-feelings against him, so he reluctantly let Shen Zechuan off\u2014He thought the Xiao Clan would understand his difficulties, but Xiao Jiming is far away in Libei. Once he learns about this matter, he will not be happy.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case.\u201d Hua Xiangyi said, \u201cCould it have been someone from the Xiao Clan who incited the Imperial College students to stir up trouble? Forcing His Majesty to rescind his edict this time would not only drive a wedge between His Majesty and the Hua Clan, it would also prevent the Secretariat Elder and Auntie from stepping forward. At the same time, it can also eliminate Shen Zechuan through the hands of another.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s so clear-cut.\u201d The Empress Dowager brushed aside Hua Xiangyi\u2019s stray hair and said dotingly, \u201cThen what\u2019s the need for Xiao Jiming to be one of the Four Generals of the world? That lad has always been prudent in his conduct. If he were the perpetrator, he would not be found out this easily. Besides, Libei has no dealings with the Imperial College.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t guess.\u201d Hua Xiangyi leaned against the Empress Dowager and said like a pampered child, \u201cTell me, Auntie.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d The Empress Dowager was childless this life, and she was not close to those on her maternal grandparents\u2019 side. The only one she doted on was Hua Xiangyi. She said,\u00a0 \u201cAuntie will teach you. Look at the surrounding Eight Cities established beyond\u00a0Qudu. The Eight Cities are where the current\u00a0Eight Great Clans5\u00a0originated. Our Hua Clan resides in the city of Dicheng at the south of the capital. It has always been the city of choice for imperial concubines. But it\u2019s only during my time that the Hua Clan was considered to be at the height of its glory and came out tops among the\u00a0Eight Great Clans. A few years earlier, when the former Emperor had only just ascended to the throne, it was the Yao Clan who was the most favored and honored. This was because the Yao Clan had been conferred as the Emperor\u2019s tutor thrice. If it weren\u2019t for Old Master Yao\u2019s lack of literary talents during his time, that Qi Huilian from Yuzhou might not even get to be the Grand Mentor of Yongyi.6\u00a0Moreover, of the current Xi Clan, only Xi Gu\u2019an has been promoted to the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Eight Great Training Divisions to manage the younger generations of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans. Just think of him as a teacher of the military camps. The Xi Clan has always been men of inferior morals and virtues; they will not achieve great things. Meanwhile, the Xue Clan has already begun its decline after the glorious death of Grand Master Xue. Xue Xiuzhuo is the only one now who has an official post in the Central Administration. As for the remaining Wei, Pan, Fei, and Han Clans, I\u2019ll tell you about them next time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard Father mention these before.\u201d Hua Xiangyi said, \u201cSo Auntie is telling me these to suggest that the secret instigator of the Imperial College this time might be someone else from the\u00a0Eight Great Clans.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I suspect.\u201d The Empress Dowager said. \u201cGlory is enjoyed in turn. It has been many years since the Hua Clan has enjoyed its rise following my ascend. It\u2019s possible for someone to harbor some other intent on seeing how gravely ill His Majesty is now. Summon Pan Rugui over tomorrow morning and let him have the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0conduct a thorough investigation in secret.\u00a0Qudu\u00a0is such a big place. I don\u2019t believe there is not a single loose lip within.\u201dXiao Chiye wrung away the water on his clothes and entered Mingli Hall together with Ji Lei.It was already late at night, and Emperor Xiande was still awake.\u201cYou have been grounded to self-reflect on the errors of your ways.\u201d Emperor Xiande held a memorial7\u00a0as he glanced at Xiao Chi Ye and asked in a hoarse voice, \u201cSo why are you running around with the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards?\u201dXiao Chiye was really wronged. He said, \u201cThe Commander-in-Chief was the one who asked this humble subject to go. This humble subject thought that it was Your Majesty\u2019s verbal orders.\u201d\u201cAfter you went,\u201d Emperor Xiande asked, \u201cHow did it go?\u201dJi Lei immediately kowtowed and said, \u201cTo reply to Your Majesty, the students of the Imperial College acted upon someone else\u2019s instigation and not only spoke presumptuously on state affairs and slandered Your Majesty, but also lay their hands on Pan-gonggong. The scene was a chaotic mess. This humble subject wanted to take them into custody, but Viceroy Xiao was unwilling to.\u201dAnd he wasn\u2019t just unwilling. That\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0was simply cast in the same mold as Xiao Chiye! They had acted shamelessly to obstruct the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0to prevent them from rounding up the students. All that was left of them was to lie on the floor and roll around! This bunch of idle military ruffians sure had skins as thick as the city wall.Emperor Xiande asked Xiao Chiye, \u201cYou obstructed the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0from arresting the students?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cThey are just a group of students. If they are really taken to the\u00a0Imperial Prison, most of them might not survive. We can disregard their lives, but what are we to do if it damages Your Majesty\u2019s virtuous name?\u201d\u201cThey banded together for selfish purposes and colluded with malicious people. They clearly intended to throw the Imperial Court into chaos! If we do not take these kinds of people to trial, then what\u2019s the use of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0in the future?\u201d Ji Lei said indignantly.Emperor Xiande coughed for a long time before he said, \u201cCe\u2019an has done well.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d Ji Lei could not believe it. \u201cThis group of students rallied to stir up trouble. They even dared to shout the word \u2018rebellion\u2019. If we do not deal with them severely,\u00a0 it will endanger the empire and state!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be frank.\u201d Emperor Xiande said in a lukewarm tone. \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t been forced to this pivotal moment, why would they come to blows with the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0and yell such words instead of attending classes? That remaining descendant of the Shen Clan should have never been released! If it weren\u2019t for\u2026 If it weren\u2019t for!\u201dEmperor Xiande cast aside the memorial and started to cough. He was back to normal after his coughing eased up a little.\u201c\u2026\u00a0 No matter what, they have to be punished. Reduce the Imperial College\u2019s fund for provisions by half and change their meals from twice a day to once. Impose the punishment on them for half a year.\u201dKnowing that Emperor Xiande had already made up his mind, Ji Lei said nothing more. He kneeled in silence, but Emperor Xiande knew what he was thinking.\u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are dogs of mine.\u201d Emperor Xiande stared at Ji Lei, \u201cAs the Commander-in-Chief of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, why are you going around acknowledging others as your godfather, god-grandfather? I have never brought this up on account that you were still considered deferential! Tonight, I want you to appease the students of the Imperial College. Do you understand?\u201dJi Lei kowtowed and said, \u201cThis humble servant obeys. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0serve only Your Majesty!\u201dBy the time they came out, the rain had already lightened. A little eunuch from the bailiff office came to hold up umbrellas for both of them.Ji Lei did not look good as he raised his hand at Xiao Chiye and made to leave. But Xiao Chiye was unconcerned as he said, \u201cOld Ji, I had no choice too. I was grounded yesterday. Even if I wanted to come out and play, I wouldn\u2019t dare to lay a hand on the students without careful consideration.\u201dLooking at how much of a jerk Xiao Chiye was made Ji Lei furious, but there was nowhere for him to vent, so he merely nodded his head at random, hoping that Xiao Chiye would leave.\u201cBut what do you think of my\u00a0Imperial Army?\u201d Xiao Chiye took the umbrella from the little eunuch\u2019s hand and dismissed him. He continued to head out of the palace with Ji Lei.Ji Lei thought,\u00a0what else? Aren\u2019t they all nothing more than a bunch of scoundrels?! They are even worse off now that they are following you!But he said politely, \u201cThey seemed to be much more spirited than before.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201d Xiao Chiye said shamelessly, \u201cI think the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s drill ground is too small to be put to good use. Can you ask the Commander-in-Chief on my behalf if he could allocate a place for the\u00a0Imperial Army?\u201dJi Lei had heard a long time ago that Xiao Chiye had led the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0to play polo at the drill ground. He never expected the latter to have the guts to ask for more land. But it wasn\u2019t good for him to turn the latter down right in the face, so he said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that would be tough. Prince Chu expanded his residence last month, and his forcible seizure of civilians\u2019 residences had even been reported to the prefectural\u00a0yamen. There are people everywhere in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0now, so where is Gu\u2019an going to find the place for you to use as a military drill ground? Besides, even if there\u2019s a spot in the city, it has to be granted to the Eight Training Divisions.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Xiao Chiye said under the umbrella, \u201cEven if it isn\u2019t the turn of our\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0to get a piece of land within the city, we can also make do with land outside of it. As long as the place is big enough to let us play to our hearts\u2019 content.\u201dIt was then Ji Lei grasped the intent of his words. He looked at Xiao Chiye and laughed. He said, \u201cAlright, Second Young Master. You\u2019ve long taken a fancy to a piece of land, haven\u2019t you? So why still play dumb with me?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already here to ask you for a favor, am I not, Old Ji?\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cYou\u2019re the one people give face to the most in\u00a0Qudu. How would the Commander-in-Chief turn you down if you put in a request to him? We can negotiate if it\u2019s a done deal.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to talk about money with me.\u201d Ji Lei finally softened his attitude. \u201cI\u2019ve acknowledged a godson, and I was just wondering where to find a good horse for him! When it comes to horses, there\u2019s no one who is more knowledgeable than the Second Young Master, is there?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll send him a few horses to play with.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThe horses bred from the Hongyan Mountains are no worse than mine. In a few days, I\u2019ll send someone to deliver them directly to your residence.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll speak to Gu\u2019an.\u201d Ji Lei said. \u201cHow big can the matter of a drill ground be? Just wait for my news!\u201dThe rain had stopped by the time both men parted ways. Xiao Chiye got into the horse carriage. Chen Yang looked at Ji Lei\u2019s sedan and said, \u201cIs the Viceroy really going to give the residence\u2019s horses to him? What a pity!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no free lunch.\u201d8\u00a0 Xiao Chiye kicked off his boots. His feet had long been soaked. \u201cWe need to have a drill ground. It\u2019s too conspicuous in the capital. If that old crook can\u2019t deliver after accepting the horses.\u201d He said coldly, \u201cThen I\u2019ll send his son to meet his ancestors.\u201dThe carriage began to sway. Xiao Chiye wiped his face with a handkerchief and asked, \u201cWhere is that man?\u201dChen Yang repeated, \u201cThat, that man?\u201d\u201cShen Zechuan!\u201d\u201cHe went back a long time ago.\u201d Chen Yang poured tea for Xiao Chiye and said, \u201cHis steps seem weak and unstable to me\u2026 With that kind of health, how is he going to take up a post in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards?\u201d\u201cRearing elephants.\u201d Xiao Chiye took the tea and gulped it all down. \u201cInvalids are only too anxious to dodge manual labor. He\u2019s most definitely the kind of person who will want to loaf on the job.\u201dThe man who wanted to loaf on the job sneezed. He sat in the dimness for a short while, wondering if he had caught a cold.Suddenly, the door was pushed open, and a rotund figure strode in. Xi Hongxuan marveled in wonder the moment he entered. \u201cThis place sure is fine. Even the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0won\u2019t be able to figure it out.\u201dWithout turning his head back, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cJust a dilapidated house with a courtyard that no one wants to rent. That\u2019s the only good thing about it.\u201d\u201cBut this compound isn\u2019t easy to get your hands on.\u201d Xi Hongxuan rubbed his hands and sat down. He looked at Shen Zechuan. \u201cThis was the old courtyard that the former Emperor bestowed to the Crown Prince, who then awarded it to Qi Huilian. It was later sold away after Qi Huilian\u2019s death. How did you get your hands on it?\u201dShen Zechuan sipped his tea as he exchanged a meaningful look with Xi Hongxuan for a moment.Xi Hongxuan raised his hand unhurriedly and said, \u201cLook at this cheap mouth of mine, always trying to pry into others\u2019 backgrounds. I heard on the way here earlier that Pan Rugui was hit too. This move of yours is truly delightful.\u201d\u201cEldest Master Xi is the Commander-in-Chief of the Eight Training Divisions.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cAfter this incident, he will rouse the Empress Dowager\u2019s suspicions. His life in the days ahead will not be easy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll feel good if Xi Gu\u2019an has a hard time.\u201d Xi Hongxuan placed his fleshy palms on the table and said, \u201cInstead of waiting for the major figures in the Imperial Court to say a word, we might as well get the students to do so first as a preemptive move. After this incident, you could be said to be truly released.\u201dShen Zechuan took the chopsticks and picked up some vegetarian food, \u201cJust a small trick. I\u2019ve made a mockery out of myself before the Second Young Master.\u201d9Xi Hongxuan watched Shen Zechuan eat before he touched his own chopsticks. He said, \u201cWhat are you going to do in the future?\u201d\u201cJust trying to get by in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cJi Lei is Pan Rugui\u2019s godson and Xi Gu\u2019an sworn brother. You want to kill Xi Gu\u2019an, but how are you going to get past Ji Lei? Why not you and I split their lives each among us and let them be good buddies for life?\u201dXi Hongxuan sniggered for a moment. He leaned over the table and asked Shen Zechuan sinisterly, \u201cWhat\u2019s your grudge with Ji Lei?\u201dShen Zechuan picked away the Sichuan peppers.10\u00a0Without even lifting his eyelids, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t like those shoes he\u2019s wearing.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 : Donkey RoastXiao Chiye had a quiet time for half a month before he finally received a reply from Ji Lei informing him that the matter of the military drill ground was a done deal. He immediately headed out of the city with Chen Yang to take a look at the place.It was a piece of wasteland that was originally a mass burial site. The platform used for execution by decapitation1\u00a0was later shifted away to another place, and so this place became empty.\u201cAlthough Mount Feng stands between it and the city,\u201d Chen Yang dismounted the horse, sized up the area, and continued, \u201cit\u2019s still too far.\u201d\u201cWe just have to run for three hours before dawn to reach it.\u201d Xiao Chiye pointed his horsewhip at one end. \u201cWe have to treat those wily old men from the Ministry of Works to a good meal to cobble together some materials so that we can fill up this side. Tidy it up a little and make do with it. This place is so remote that even the patrols of the Eight Great Training Divisions will not make it here. \u201c\u201cViceroy, for us to spend money on them.\u201d Chen Yang said, \u201cI can\u2019t even say how uncomfortable that makes me.\u201d\u201cHold it in even if you are uncomfortable.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cEven if they squat on our heads to pee on us, we still have to fix up this place.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Chen Yang did not dare to say a word more.Xiao Chiye stayed until it was evening before he rode his horse back. The moment he entered the city, he saw Li Jianheng\u2019s guard waiting for him at the entrance.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Xiao Chiye reined in his horse and asked.The guard paid his obeisances and said, \u201cHis Highness has organized a feast at Huixiang Tavern on Donglong Street. He\u2019s waiting for Your Excellency to go over for a meal.\u201dXiao Chiye thought for a moment, then spurred his horse over.The main street of Donglong faced Kailing River. Lanterns blazed the moment night fell. Wine taverns and pleasure houses flanked both sides of the street, while all kinds of gaily painted pleasure boats and small, light boats parked on the river.Xiao Chiye dismounted his horse at Huixiang Tavern. The shopkeeper followed at his beck and call and personally led him up upstairs. It was only when he raised the curtain for a look that he realized this feast was not simple.Everyone present at the feast was either well-known or young masters whose fathers or elder brothers were working as governmental officials. Next to Prince Chu was a fair-faced little eunuch who looked delicate and pretty. This should be the grandson Pan Rugui had found for himself again after Xiaofuzi\u2019s death.\u201cCe\u2019an is here!\u201d Li Jianheng called out to him. \u201cCome and take a seat. We\u2019re waiting for you!\u201dXiao Chiye picked a vacant seat at random to sit. He said with a smile, \u201cWhat a large turnout.\u201d\u201cLet me introduce. This is Pan-gonggong\u2019s grandson, Feng Quan, Feng-gonggong!\u201d Li Jianheng said to Feng Quan, \u201cThis is my good buddy, the Second Young Master of the Libei\u2019s Xiao Clan, and the Viceroy of the\u00a0Imperial Army, Xiao Ce\u2019an.\u201dFeng Quan was more pleasing to the eye than Xiaofuzi had been. He bowed respectfully to Xiao Chiye and said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about the Viceroy.\u201dXi Hongxuan sat opposite them with one leg crossed over the other. He took up two seats and was so warm that his plump face was perspiring profusely. He said, \u201cLet\u2019s dispense with the formalities. Your Highness, which other guest has yet to arrive today? If everyone is here, let\u2019s start the feast!\u201dLi Jianheng raised his eyebrows at Xiao Chiye and said, \u201cI have also invited a distinguished guest whom everyone wants to meet.\u201dXiao Chiye was baffled by his unexpected gesture. Just then, he heard the waiter behind him lift the curtain and announce, \u201cThe distinguished guest has arrived!\u201dEveryone at the feast fell silent.Xiao Chiye looked back just in time to see Shen Zechuan, dressed in his\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019 robe, striding in. Shen Zechuan was visibly stupefied on seeing him. However, his expression was so obvious that Xiao Chiye did not believe it at all.Everyone present knew that there was discord between them. For a moment, the atmosphere was strange. Those waiting to watch the drama exchanged meaningful glances at one another.Li Jianheng said warmly, \u201cThis is Shen Lanzhou. Everyone knows who he is, right? Lanzhou, take a seat. Shopkeeper, start the feast!\u201dXiao Chiye felt that Li Jianheng must have been possessed to invite Shen Zechuan over just because of that face of his.Of all places to sit, Shen Zechuan just had to pick the seat beside Xiao Chiye. Both men looked at each other as he sat down.\u201cSo, this is Shen Lanzhou, whose name has been making waves in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0lately.\u201d Xi Hongxuan looked askance at Shen Zechuan. \u201cSeeing is truly believing.\u201d\u201cI heard that Lanzhou\u2019s\u2026\u201d Li Jianheng said, \u201c\u2026 mother was an unparalleled beauty in Duanzhou back then. Shen Wei had to stake half of his princely residence before he won her heart! So how could Lanzhou not be born pretty?\u201dA scattering of laughter rose in the room. Everyone openly and surreptitiously glanced at Shen Zechuan\u2019s face. Even Feng Quan made noises of appreciation and lamented, \u201cIf this Master had been born a female\u2026\u201d\u201cThen what will the lady of the Hua Clan be good for?!\u201dThe group of rich young masters tacitly burst into laughter. Out of the corner of his eye, Xiao Chiye saw Shen Zechuan with his head partially lowered. He could not read the latter\u2019s emotions.The nape of this man\u2019s neck was shrouded under the dim light of the glazed lamp beside him. It extended under his collar like white jade, looking as if one could taste ecstasy by kneading it. It waited defenselessly for someone to make a move. The contours of his side profile were smooth and beautiful, and the arch of the bridge of his nose was gorgeous. The corners of his eyes were the most devastating; everything that could make one\u2019s heart itch all lay within them. A faint hint of a smile followed as those corners curved upward.Xiao Chiye took another look.Shen Zechuan was indeed smiling.\u201cHave you mistaken me for someone else?\u201d Shen Zechuan tilted his eyes towards Xiao Chiye.\u201cJust looking at you in a different light.\u201d Xiao Chiye retracted his gaze.Shen Zechuan raised his eyes and smiled subserviently at the various gentlemen present at the feast. He said, \u201cI\u2019m just of average looks. Everyone has been too kind to me.\u201dOn hearing his words, those who were still carrying themselves with decorum loosened up. The more they spoke, the more vulgar their words.Xi Hongxuan said, \u201cWasn\u2019t there a new trick that had come into vogue recently on Donglong Street? It\u2019s called \u2018playing with cups\u2019. Fill up a golden cup with top-grade wine and place it in the fragrant shoe of a beauty and pass it around to drink for fun. Your Highness, have you played it before?\u201dLi Jianheng laughed and said, \u201cI have the wine, but I can\u2019t find a beauty.\u201dXi Hongxuan motioned flippantly, \u201cIsn\u2019t one sitting right here?\u201dAll along, Shen Zechuan looked as if he was not acquainted with him. He forced a smile and said, \u201cI\u2019m not worthy of the \u2018beauty\u2019 label. If everyone really wants to have fun, then I\u2019ll invite everyone to the brothel tonight to play to your hearts\u2019 content.\u201dWhen all is said and done, Shen Zechuan still had the Hua Clan to back him. On seeing this, the others did not dare to push it. Only Xi Hongxuan seemed as if his eight characters2\u00a0conflicted with Shen Zechuan\u2019s. The more ruckus he created, the uglier the situation became. There had been news lately that Xi Gu\u2019an had lost favor with the Empress Dowager, so all of them simply thought that Xi Hongxuan was venting his anger on Shen Zechuan for his elder brother.Shen Zechuan was about to speak when he suddenly heard Xiao Chiye say beside him, \u201cHow can you ask His Highness Prince Chu to play what others have played before? This drinking from shoes and playing with cups is such an old game from centuries ago. Even the prostitutes in the south aren\u2019t interested in it. How about we try a different way of playing? Second Young Master Xi, take off your shoes, and we can use them as boats to fool around with.\u201dThose at the feast roared with laughter. Xi Hongxuan was obese, and his feet were much bigger than the average man. No one usually dared to bring it up, so they did not expect Xiao Chiye to poke fun at it.\u201cThat works too.\u201d Xi Hongxuan rolled with it and graciously raised his legs. He ordered, \u201cMen! Remove my shoes!\u201dLi Jianheng started to have fun and cussed a few words.Shen Zechuan did not expect Xiao Chiye to help him out of a fix either. He and Xi Hongxuan had been putting on a show. He looked at Xiao Chiye again.Xiao Chiye ignored him and picked up his chopsticks to grab some food to eat.The little eunuch, Feng Quan, sat for a moment. When he saw that the dishes were more or less served, he said, \u201cHaving fun is a matter for you gentlemen here. So let me add another dish for everyone tonight.\u201dAs he spoke, he clapped his hands. The waiters downstairs who were already prepared a long time ago hurriedly entered to serve the dish.However, this \u201cdish\u201d was a small donkey that was still alive.Feng Quan said, \u201cOf all the delicacies in the world, donkey meat is the best. Gentlemen, have you ever tried \u2018donkey roast\u2019?\u201dThe noise in the room died down. Everyone looked at the donkey in the center.Li Jianheng asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018donkey roast?\u201dThe waiters dumped some soil on the ground and deftly made a small circular plot of land out of the soil. They chased the donkey onto the soil and buried its four hooves in it so that the donkey\u2019s belly was touching the soil. Then, they covered the donkey with a thick padded quilt.\u201cGentlemen.\u201d Feng Quan said amicably. \u201cWatch.\u201dA waiter half-crouched as he took the ladle and scooped out the boiling soup that came fresh out of the pot and poured it all over. Those assisting beside him held down the quilt and wiped it down over the head of the braying donkey to scald off its fur while it was still alive. But they were still not done. The waiter who had poured the boiling soup set aside the ladle and gouged the meat out of this seared donkey\u2019s body.The meat was placed in the dish, and the man by the side of the stove roasted it on the spot. After he was done, he passed the plate one at a time to everyone present.The braying of the donkey grew even more tragic. Even the people downstairs were alarmed.The color drained from Li Jianheng\u2019s face. He looked at this donkey meat and covered his nose and mouth to say, \u201cFeng-gonggong, isn\u2019t this dish a little too\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Highness, why don\u2019t you try it first? This donkey meat is the most delicious when it is gouged out right after boiling soup has been poured over it. Food must be eaten fresh.\u201d Feng Quan pointed out. \u201cThere\u2019s a meaning to this \u2018donkey roast\u2019. Let\u2019s take a certain person as an example. If said person were to fall into the hands of others, then he must put himself at the mercy of others. If the master tells him to kneel, he must kneel. If the master wants him to cry, he must cry. And if the master is eyeing his flesh, he must let others gouge him like this.\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s situation was like this donkey. He looked at the bloodstained quilt. The blood trickled into the soil until the stench of it permeated the air. It was as if he was looking at Ji Mu and himself five years ago.\u201cExcellent taste!\u201d Xi Hongxuan ate a few slices. He seemed like he did not grasp the meaning behind and was only concerned about proclaiming how much of a thrill it was.All this time, Shen Zechuan\u2019s chopsticks did not move, while Xiao Chiye\u2019s chopsticks never touched the meat.Li Jianheng felt something odd about those words when he heard it. He said apprehensively, \u201cIt\u2019s really too depraved. Take it away!\u201d\u201cHold on.\u201d Feng Quan finally looked at Shen Zechuan. \u201cYoung Master Shen, my godfather was the one who specifically asked me to serve this dish. Why aren\u2019t you eating it?\u201dPan Rugui was his god-grandfather, so by extension, Ji Lei could really be considered his godfather! Exactly what connection or backing did this lad have for him to get Pan Rugui\u2019s favor and trust this quickly? Not only did he take over Xiaofuzi\u2019s duties, he even got into Ji Lei\u2019s good graces.Ji Lei could not kill Shen Zechuan. And now that Shen Zechuan had come under his command, he could not touch him either. Coming up with such a lowdown way to humiliate Shen Zechuan tonight was to make it clear that the grudge between them was not over.Shen Zechuan picked up the chopsticks.\u201cI\u2026\u201dBefore Shen Zechuan could finish his words, the chair beside him was suddenly pushed aside as Xiao Chiye rose to his feet. He picked up the plate containing the donkey meat and flung it in Feng Quan\u2019s direction. It crashed to the ground with a \u201cclatter\u201d.Li Jianheng hurriedly stood up and said, \u201cCe, Ce\u2019an\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye stared at Feng Quan.Whoever Feng Quan wanted to humiliate on Ji Lei\u2019s behalf was not something he could interfere with. But he, Xiao Chiye, was also a caged beast right this hour and day. He was no different from this donkey.This was a slap in his face too. And it hurt.Feng Quan looked at him in puzzlement and asked, \u201cIs it not to the Viceroy\u2019s liking?\u201dXiao Chiye pressed his thumb down on the hilt of\u00a0Langli Blade3\u00a0at the side of his waist. Screams rose in the entire room as he drew his blade. His hand rose, and the blade fell to decapitate the donkey, killing it. Its miserable braying ceased. Blood seeped out of the soil onto the ground, turning the floor vividly red. The others all held their breath, not knowing what Xiao Chiye would do.With his back to the dim light, Xiao Chiye wiped the edge of his blade clean with the tablecloth. Only then did he casually turn around and smiled at all those present. \u201c\u2014Gentlemen, please continue.\u201dLi Jianheng stared at his blade and said softly, \u201cCe\u2019an, Ce\u2019an, keep, keep it away.\u201dXiao Chiye kept the blade back into its sheath and threw a look at Feng Quan. He raised his foot to lift a chair over and sat unreservedly in the middle. He said, \u201cRoast it all together. I\u2019ll be here tonight to watch Feng-gonggong\u00a0eat.\u201dIn the end, Feng Quan called for his sedan chair and left in a hurry.Li Jianheng drank some wine and wept as he said to Xiao Chiye, \u201cCe\u2019an, I really didn\u2019t think of this. Who would know that castrated crook to be so despicable? We are buddies. You mustn\u2019t let this matter hurt our friendship!\u201dXiao Chiye tugged at the corners of his mouth and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a distinction between those close to you and those distant from you. I understand. You go on ahead first.\u201dLi Jianheng tugged at his sleeves, wanting to say more. Xiao Chiye simply got Chen Yang to stuff Li Jianheng into the sedan.\u201cSend Prince Chu back.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cI\u2019ll walk back myself.\u201dIn no way would Chen Yang ramble on when he saw the unhappiness in Xiao Chiye\u2019s expression, so he got on his horse and left with Prince Chu\u2019s sedan.Xiao Chiye alone stood under a lantern. After a moment, he kicked over somebody else\u2019s potted plant.The potted plant, which was worth a lot of money, tumbled on the ground and hit the bottom of the stairs. A hand gently held it up.Shen Zechuan stood on the stairs and said unperturbedly, \u201cAre you that rich? You\u2019ll have to compensate for this, you know?\u201dXiao Chiye replied coldly, \u201cI have lots of money.\u201dWith that, he felt around his waist. But it was empty.Shen Zechuan waited for a while, then turned to the shopkeeper and said, \u201cPut it on this master\u2019s tab. He has lots of money.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 : Truth vs. LiesThe breeze caressed past the hot summer night, whilst the moon hung over the lush treetops.Xiao Chiye was in tiptop form, so the rush of wine promptly made him hot. At the moment, he was irritable. He stared at Shen Zechuan as the latter made his way down. He said, \u201cSo Zhao Zui Temple can still teach one to purify one\u2019s heart of desires and change one\u2019s temper.\u201dShen Zechuan dismissed the waiter and said, \u201cI\u2019m the best at grinning and bearing it.\u201dXiao Chiye accepted the waiter\u2019s tea to rinse his mouth. Then he wiped his mouth and said, \u201cAt least do a decent job if you want to make it up. You probably don\u2019t even know how to spell those last four words.\u201d\u201cWe are all just playing along for fun.\u201d Shen Zechuan wiped his hands and smiled at him. \u201cYet, you took it seriously.\u201dXiao Chiye did not look at him. He simply threw the handkerchief onto the tray and said, \u201cThe show is over. Who would believe that? Someone has to play that particular role, no? I, Xiao Ce\u2019an, was just perfect for it. Didn\u2019t you feel good watching it too?\u201d\u201cThat blade is a treasure.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes wandered down.Xiao Chiye raised his hand to block his view and said, \u201cAnd the person isn\u2019t?\u201dOne of the lanterns upstairs went out. Shen Zechuan sighed and said \u201cHow do you expect me to reply to that? That\u2019s rather inappropriate.\u201d\u201cYou have a good eye.\u201d Xiao Chiye moved his hand away and stared at him ruthlessly and fiercely. \u201cFew people can recognize a good blade.\u201d\u201cThe man himself is precious.\u201d1\u00a0Shen Zechuan went along with his words, \u201cSo naturally, everything he wears is quality stuff. Even a blind cat can stumble upon a dead mouse.2\u00a0I was merely guessing.\u201d\u201cWhy is it that when you praise me,\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cI feel as if I\u2019ve seen a ghost?\u201d\u201cYou hardly get praised, huh?\u201d Shen Zechuan comforted him and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t even voiced my most sincere ones yet.\u201dThe surrounding people had all dispersed.Xiao Chiye said in a lukewarm tone, \u201cYou sure can endure.\u201d\u201cGrand plans are ruined by a lack of forbearance. There\u2019s more of my capability to come.\u201d Shen Zechuan smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t be so anxious.\u201d\u201cGrand plans.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cQudu\u00a0is only this big. What else is there for you to strive this hard for?\u201d\u201cI was just saying.\u201d Shen Zechuan paused and looked affectionately at Xiao Chiye. \u201cAnd you really believed it. Second Young Master, I really couldn\u2019t tell that you are the kind who are na\u00efve and artless.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just a frivolous young master who\u2019s just loafing around drinking and dining and waiting to die.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cHow would I know how treacherous the world is? There\u2019s even someone like you to coax me.\u201d\u201cMy bad.\u201d Shen Zechuan moved a step. \u201cI saw how pitiful you were with your talons and fangs sealed off. Slaying with your blade tonight must have been pretty gratifying for you.\u201d\u201cA little.\u201d Xiao Chiye lifted his leg to block Shen Zechuan\u2019s way and said, \u201cWhere are you going? We aren\u2019t done talking yet. \u201c\u201cSending you back to your residence.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cYou helped me out a tight spot tonight. I\u2019m so grateful I\u2019m shedding tears. There is no way I can ever repay you for this kindness.\u201dXiao Chiye smiled and said, \u201cYou are so full of lies. You must have deceived quite a number of people, huh?\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t many who have been taken in.\u201d Shen Zechuan looked back. \u201cA man always has to tell a few lies, like \u2018I\u2019ve lots of money\u2019 that kind.\u201dXiao Chiye withdrew his leg and said, \u201cI\u2019m nothing compared to you.\u201d\u201cSee.\u201d Shen Zechuan said gently, \u201cYou\u2019re being polite again.\u201dThere was simply no way to chat with this man.Because there was no way he could tell which of his words were the truth and which were the lies. Every sentence was like the superficial surface of muddied water. Even if he circled around it, he could still not pry anything out of it.Xiao Chiye turned around and whistled for his horse. He said, \u201cIt was because of the incident tonight that you speak on such close terms to me. Everyone is gone now. It\u2019s meaningless to keep on pretending.\u201d\u201cThen what can I do?\u201d Shen Zechuan picked up the lantern and looked at him gently and obediently. \u201cGive you another bite?\u201dXiao Chiye swiftly took a step closer and said with ease, \u201cYou use this mortal flesh of yours to bewitch others. What do you want me to think by looking at me like that?\u201dUnperturbed, Shen Zechuan said to him in a soft voice, \u201cI was born with such a pair of expressive eyes.\u201dXiao Chiye used his whip to point between Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyebrows without touching it. He said derisively, \u201cWhat a waste of those eyes. All they contain within are machinations.\u201d\u201cI was born to be lowly.\u201d Shen Zechuan lifted his finger and slowly pushed aside his whip. He said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t machinate, then how am I going to have my fun?\u201d\u201cI did what I did tonight for myself.\u201d Xiao Chiye said mercilessly. \u201cDon\u2019t you go around thinking it was because I\u2019m interested in you.\u201d\u201cThe moon is so beautiful tonight.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cWhy do you have to spoil the mood and stop me from thinking so?\u201dXiao Chiye flipped onto the horse and looked at him for a moment as he held the reins. He said frivolously, \u201cI fear that you will latch on to me because of this bit of kindness and get on my nerves with all those weeping and wailing.\u201d\u201cDid you have too much to drink?\u201d Shen Zechuan insinuated. \u201cYou are beyond cure.\u201d\u201cWho knows about that?\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have never made such an unreasonable scene before.\u201dThe night quietened down.Xiao Chiye withdrew his eyes. This could be said to be a small victory. He spurred his horse on a few steps when he suddenly heard the man behind him say with a smile.\u201cHave you found what you lost five years ago?\u201dXiao Chiye abruptly looked back and instantly reined in his horse. He demanded in a frosty voice, \u201cReturn me the thumb ring.\u201dShen Zechuan looked at him, but Xiao Chiye found the expression in his eyes wicked.Shen Zechuan said, \u201cWant the thumb ring? Easy. Bark twice like a dog, and I\u2019ll give it back to you.\u201dThe gyrfalcon swooped down and landed on Xiao Chiye\u2019s shoulder. Together with its master, it stared frostily at Shen Zechuan. It was in the dead of night. An unnamed watchman3\u00a0struck his clapper4\u00a0and startled the lantern in Shen Zechuan\u2019s hand into extinguishing.The road went dark.It was several days later before Li Jianheng dared to show his face before Xiao Chiye. He was surprised to find that Xiao Chiye\u2019s anger had yet to subside. Ice fragments kept scattering all around them while they were listening to the music, scaring those delicate, smooth-skinned ladies so much that not one of them dared to come over to wait upon them.Li Jianheng held the teacup in his hands to shield himself and whispered, \u201cAre you still angry?\u201dXiao Chiye chomped the ice to pieces and said, \u201cNope.\u201dLi Jianheng\u2019s hair stood on end as he heard those \u201ccrunch\u201d sounds. He said, \u201cAutumn is right around the corner, so don\u2019t eat ice like that. It\u2019s rather terrifying.\u201d\u201cSuch a big cellar of ice is prepared every year. It\u2019d be a waste to leave it there.\u201d Xiao Chiye propped up both his legs and leaned back.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll tell you something happy.\u201d Li Jianheng could not help but shift his butt over. He said, \u201cThat Feng Quan. You know who he is?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cRemember that little lady I told you about.\u201d Li Jianheng beamed and said with shifty eyes, \u201cFeng Quan is her younger brother. She has now won the favor of Pan Rugui, so how could Pan Rugui not promote Feng Quan? This Feng Quan is such a glib talker. He even coaxed Ji Lei until Ji Lei was over the moon and wanted to take him as his son!\u201d\u201cFrom the looks of it.\u201d Xiao Chiye propped up his head with one arm and glanced at Li Jianheng. \u201cYou really have your heart set on that little lady.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Li Jianheng said, \u201cSo, the incident that day was all done by that bastard, Ji Lei. As his son, how would Feng Quan dare to defy his father\u2019s order?\u201d\u201cSo, you are saying you want me to let him off?\u201d Xiao Chiye asked.Li Jianheng was a flexible man who did not have the aspirations expected of the descendants of the imperial clan. He hurriedly slipped down from his chair and squatted before Xiao Chiye to implore him. \u201cBuddy, please let him off this once for the sake of my romance. Besides, didn\u2019t we make him eat until he puked? He\u2019s Pan Rugui\u2019s man, after all. It isn\u2019t good not to give him face. It has only been a few days since Xiaofuzi\u2019s incident. His Majesty is still watching us.\u201dXiao Chiye suddenly stared at him. He sat up and asked, \u201cDid you touch her?\u201dLi Jianheng hummed.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cYou touch Pan Rugui\u2019s woman right under his nose?\u201d\u201cIf he were a real man, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Li Jianheng reluctantly stood up and said, \u201cHe\u2019s just an old eunuch with just that bit of trick to liven things up. He beat up a delicate and ravishing beauty all day long until she wept! This beauty was originally mine. If you were in my shoes, would you do it or not?!\u201d5Exasperated at Li Jianheng\u2019s failure to live up to expectations, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cNo!\u201dLi Jianheng pleaded again, \u201cCe\u2019an, we are buddies! How big an issue can it be? Hm? Just turn a blind eye. If you let Feng Quan off, I\u2019ll give you something else to play with!\u201dXiao Chiye lay back again and said nothing.If Pan Rugui found out about this incident, then Xiaofuzi\u2019s episode would be nothing in comparison. That old dog would definitely think of ways to kill them both. His promotion of Feng Quan alone was sufficient for anyone to get a glimpse of how much he doted on that woman.Pan Rugui was already sixty-five years of age. He had no biological son, and none of the pretty women around him these years could remain by his side for so long. If he truly regarded this woman as his wife or concubine, then he might even dare to hack Li Jianheng to death.Xiao Chiye listened to Li Jianheng\u2019s incessant chatter and said, \u201cSince you dared to do this, does it mean you already have a plan thought out?\u201dLi Jianheng sat on the carpet and lowered his head to study his moso-bamboo fan. He said in a small voice, \u201c\u2026 Not really\u2026 It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve heard, heard that Pan Rugui had once kept a toy boy. All I have to do is to just have to send him one to play with, no?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cThere aren\u2019t many who could surpass that beauty of yours, are there?\u201dLi Jianheng was on tenterhooks and did not dare to hide it from him. He said, \u201cLately, quite a number of people have been asking around about that\u2026 Shen Lanzhou.\u201d\u201cAsking about what?\u201d\u201cAsking about his price, and whether they could afford to raise him.\u201d Seeing Xiao Chiye\u2019s expressionless face, Li Jianheng hurriedly grabbed the chair and said, \u201cMoney is not an issue. But I don\u2019t dare to look for him. If he were to take desperate measures after being pushed into the corner\u2026 Ce\u2019an, help me this once! You just need to send him to Pan Rugui. After the job is done, I\u2019ll give him silver! Or even gold!\u201dXiao Chiye rested his hands on his knees in silence.Thinking there was hope, Li Jianheng said again, \u201cDon\u2019t you hate Shen Wei? Once you fix him this time, Shen Zechuan would not dare to throw his weight before you in the future! Think about it. If he didn\u2019t die, he would be able to turn things around. But if he were to be involved in such a shady deal in\u00a0Qudu, he would lead a life worse than death! Furthermore, isn\u2019t the Empress Dowager also thinking of\u2026\u201d\u201cI thought you were using your brain while speaking.\u201d Xiao Chiye slowly pulled out his legs and said, \u201cTurns out it\u2019s all fucking mush inside.\u201d\u201cCe\u2019an, Ce\u2019an!\u201d Seeing him leave, Li Jianheng lifted the hem of his robe and chased after him out of the door.Xiao Chiye stepped out of the building and mounted his horse. Without even turning his head back, he left.Even if they let Shen Zechuan be Pan Rugui\u2019s forbidden pleasure, would Pan Rugui dare to accept him? This man was the man the Empress Dowager was always watching with the intent to protect. If Pan Rugui dared to take him, then he would be burning his own bridges. Li Jianheng was out of his mind!But, if Li Jianheng really dared to do that.If Li Jianheng really dared to do that\u2026How would he suddenly dare to do that?Shen Zechuan got off work. He had only just removed his waist token and stepped out of the door when he saw that excellent, handsome steed of Xiao Chiye.He descended the stairs and asked, \u201cHere to ask for your thumb ring back?\u201dXiao Chiye snapped off a branch with leaves and held it between his teeth. He looked at him for a moment and said, \u201cIt\u2019s broad daylight, and you are still not sober? Return it to me. Stop bullshitting me.\u201d\u201cYou weren\u2019t this short-tempered that other night.\u201d Shen Zechuan looked at the sky. \u201cIt would be too humiliating for the Viceroy if you were to stand here and bark like a dog. Which means you aren\u2019t here for the thumb ring. So what\u2019s the matter? Spit it out.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you well aware of what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Xiao Chiye sat on the rock with his long legs to prop up his elbows and arms. \u201cPrince Chu wanted to give Xiaofuzi a thrashing, and you could even get a line on it from inside the temple. I forgot all about it at the turn of the head. But now that I think about it, you must have planted a man by his side, right? If he wasn\u2019t an informer, then he was the instigator who told him to do so.\u201d\u201cIf I were that capable.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cI would not have been reduced to raising elephants.\u201d\u201cWho knows if that\u2019s the truth or a lie?\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes were aloof and cold. \u201cYou have to give me a clear account before I can decide whether or not to believe it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 : Decision\u201cI\u2019m so wronged.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cIf anything were to happen now, it\u2019s definitely all Shen Lanzhou\u2019s fault.\u201d\u201cThere has been trouble after trouble ever since your release.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cXiaofuzi, the Imperial College, Pan Rugui\u2026 How is it that every incident has something to do with you?\u201dShen Zechuan said wryly, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Why is it that they all have something to do with me? Don\u2019t you know the reason for this? Back then, the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0found me in the Chashi Sinkhole. If he had used his blade to end me, then these incidents today would never have happened. \u201cXiao Chiye took down the branch of leaves and said, \u201cBack then, you fought to survive and drag out an ignoble existence. Did you only come to realize what it feels like to live today?\u201dThe calmness in Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes was so placid that Xiao Chiye found it surreal.This man was extremely odd.It was the same that day during the feast. His every move carried with it an undercurrent of \u201chaving left behind the past.\u201d But Xiao Chiye could still clearly remember the look in Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes when the latter had bitten him five years ago on that snowy night.Such disconnect from reality seemed to be like a bottomless abyss he could not get a grasp of. Those spurts of hatred seemed to have been worn away until others had no way of telling where his limit lay. Everyone at the feast humiliated him, and yet he merely lowered his head and smiled. When Xiao Chiye had said that he was seeing him in a different light, he had truly meant it.If a man could grin and bear it to this extent, then that darkness under that calm was, on the contrary, all the more disturbing to Xiao Chiye.\u201cWhat it feels like to be alive.\u201d Shen Zechuan smiled again. \u201cI can feel it every single day and night while I was in Zhao Zui Temple. Now that I\u2019ve been released, all the more I find that living isn\u2019t easy. I treasure my life. And I\u2019m afraid. But they want me to shoulder this sin and pay for all those human lives with my own. I, Shen Lanzhou, has only this one life. How is that even enough to pay for them all? I ingratiate myself with everyone in so many ways all in the hope that Second Young Master and the various nobles will be magnanimous and won\u2019t be too hard on me. Today, you want me to give you an account. Second Young Master, at least give me a reason.\u201dBy the time Xiao Chiye listened to this point, he had already changed his mind. He has a keen nose and he always vaguely felt uneasy every time Shen Zechuan cooperated in such a compliant and docile manner. But Shen Zechuan yielded to neither cajolery nor coercion. No matter how hard Xiao Chiye tried to pry it out of him, he could not tell the truth from his lies.He did not believe a word of what Shen Zechuan said. Just as Shen Zechuan had said that night, everyone was just playing along for fun. Since that was the case, so why take it seriously?But although people could lie, the traces left behind could not. He just had to mingle among the Nine Schools of Thoughts1\u00a0in\u00a0Qudu, and ten to one he would be able to pry something loose. Shen Zechuan wanted to plant a man by Li Jianheng\u2019s side, and it was certain that this person would not be an expert. Based on Shen Zechuan\u2019s current circumstances, he could only bribe an errand-runner or an attendant.This Li Jianheng\u2019s matter was questionable both on the inside and on the outside. If he could not investigate this thoroughly, then there will be no end to troubles in the future. Ever since Xiao Chiye cast his lot with Prince Chu, he found himself sleeping less.\u201cI came looking for you to play. How did it become an interrogation?\u201d Xiao Chiye changed the topic. He blew the leaves on the branch and lamented, \u201cI heard that someone is making enquiries about you recently. This involves Prince Chu\u2019s dignity, so naturally, I have to come and ask you.\u201d\u201cEach time you come finding me to play.\u201d\u00a0 Shen Zechuan said, \u201cI\u2019ll lose sleep for a night.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t put it that way.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t having an easy time, and I\u2019m not having a good time either. We can turn the page on the old grudges between us and let bygones be bygones.\u201dShen Zechuan laughed and said, \u201cTens of thousands of lives in the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo were lost. And the Second Young wants to bury the hatchet with me.\u201d\u201cTimes are different now.\u201d Xiao Chiye finally threw away the branch. He rose to his feet and said, \u201cYou have now received the favor of the Hua Clan, and you\u2019re the man in the Empress Dowager\u2019s good graces. How would I still dare to offend you? Calling me Second Young Master sounds so distant. We could be said to be nodding acquaintances now. Right? Lanzhou.\u201dShen Zechuan merely smiled and said, \u201cSecond Young Master, goodbye.\u201dXiao Chiye got on his horse and looked at him from above. He said, \u201cWhen are you going to return the thumb ring to me, Lanzhou? A worn-out thumb ring isn\u2019t worth a cent and keeping it will just revolt you. But why is it that\u00a0 instead of returning it to me, you seem like you have come to treat it as a treasure?\u201d\u201cI wear it on me.\u201d Shen Zechuan said to Xiao Chiye, \u201cJust to rely on Second Young Master\u2019s ferocious aura to ward off evil. So how would I bear to return it to you this easily?\u201dXiao Chiye lashed his horsewhip with a \u201ccrack\u201d and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know? It\u2019s exactly evil aura that Your Second Young Master has.\u201dShen Zechuan stood where he was and watched him gallop away into the distance. His smile faded away, leaving only an unfathomable stillness. The setting sun dipped, and the orange light reflected under his feet extended into the shadow of Xiao Chiye\u2019s gradually disappearing back.Stars adorned the night sky. Grand Mentor Qi opened the newly drawn map and showed it to Shen Zechuan.\u201cThe former Eastern Palace did not have the authority to deploy troops at the frontier. But it came to receive intimate knowledge from the Ministry of War on the setups of the various lands\u2019 garrison troops. This is of the Libei Great Commandery\u2019s.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s backed by Hongyan Mountains, and its west leads to Luoxia Pass, while the east overlooks the Biansha Twelve Tribes.\u201d Shen Zechuan pointed at the Hongyan Mountains on the east side. \u201cAutumn is around the corner. There is an under-supply of pasture for the Biansha Cavalry, so they are bound to rob the mutual trade market at the boundary. Xiao Jiming wants to deploy his troops. So why isn\u2019t there a memorial2\u00a0seeking instructions being sent to\u00a0Qudu\u00a0these days?\u201d\u201cBecause His Majesty is severely ill.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi pondered over it. \u201cThis year Spring, Xiao Jiming had only submitted one memorial. He surely has an informant in\u00a0Qudu. Since he still has yet to submit a memorial for the deployment as of today, then it could only mean one thing.\u201dShen Zechuan said under his breath, \u201cHis Majesty doesn\u2019t have long to live.\u201d\u201cSo, exactly who is it that can secure the imperial court is Xiao Jiming\u2019s reason for biding his time now.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi took out a brush, dipped it in ink, and drew a circle around Li Bei. \u201cPrince Chu\u2019s accession to the throne will only benefit the Xiao Clan. They have been at odds with the Hua Clan for too long. Because of the Zhongbo incident, they have fallen to the disadvantageous position of being under the control of others, and the opportunity to turn the tide in their favor is now right before them. Xiao Jiming will definitely not pass up this opportunity.\u201d\u201cBut Teacher has also said that day.\u201d Shen Zechuan pointed to\u00a0Qudu. \u201cAs long as the gates of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0remain closed, Xiao Chiye remains the hostage from Libei. With him in the Empress Dowager\u2019s hand, how is Xiao Jiming able to act?\u201d\u201cSince you mentioned this matter.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi cast aside his brush. \u201cThen, I will tell you of another matter.\u201d\u201cTeacher, please speak.\u201d\u201cIn your view, what kind of man is this Xiao Chiye?\u201dShen Zechuan lowered his eyes to look at the map and replied, \u201cSharp. Smart. Doesn\u2019t like to follow the steps.\u201d\u201cI think he is.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi scratched his head as if he could not think of a suitable word. After a moment of frustration, he sprawled over the table and said mysteriously to Shen Zechuan, \u201cI think he is the opportunity Heaven sent to Libei to turn things around. He\u2019s a natural-born talent.\u201dShen Zechuan swung his brush and asked, \u201cWhy does Teacher say so?\u201dGrand Mentor Qi immediately got under the table and pulled out the book he had written with his own hands. Over the years, he sensed himself becoming old and forgetful, and so he had recorded down many matters on paper. With swishing sounds, he flipped through several pages, then leaned over the table again and pushed the book to Shen Zechuan.\u201cThese are the details Ge Qingqing managed to pry from the Ministry of War. In the first year of Yongyi,3\u00a0that is, eight years ago, Xiao Chiye was fourteen years of age when he followed Xiao Jiming into battle at Biansha. In the middle of the summer, Xiao Jiming was besieged by three Biansha Tribes at the eastern side of the Hongyan Mountain Ranges. His retreat route was cut off, and he was trapped before the Hongjiang River. The Prince of Libei\u2019s reinforcements did not arrive for three days, and Xiao Jiming pressed on with his desperate battle for survival. But the cavalries of the three Biansha Tribes were nimble. As you know, Libei has a legion of Armored Cavalry. They can deal a powerful blow head-on like a wall of iron, but they can\u2019t respond agilely enough to a battle that entails back-and-forth pursuits. Drag it on for too long, and the one exhausted will be Xiao Jiming\u2019s troops.\u201dGrand Mentor Qi downed a few mouthfuls of wine.\u201cBut on the third night, Biansha retreated like the ebbing of tide. Because their heavily guarded army provisions were set on fire. The fire spread from the center and threw their rear formation into disarray. Xiao Jiming seized the opportunity to fight a decisive battle and broke through the siege in one night. However, the statement from Libei was cut off at this point. The following details were all information that your\u00a0Shifu\u00a0took a lot of effort to find out. Can you guess how the heavily guarded army provisions were sent up into flames? Allegedly, the three Biansha Tribes constructed and dug a trench for lavatory purposes near the river. Xiao Chiye silently felt his way from the Hongjiang River to the trench and crawled in that filthy and stinky ditch for half a night.\u201dAt this point, Grand Mentor Qi stroked his chin.\u201cYet, Libei suppressed such a meritorious service and did not report it. Not only that. Xiao Chiye came to\u00a0Qudu\u00a0and became an idle hoodlum\u2014but how could a loafer have such endurance? Just imagine. Under that kind of circumstances, if he fails, then his eldest brother would be the one to die. Yet, he could lay dormant for two days until the Biansha troops let their guards down before he set the fire. Did he know that his eldest brother\u2019s life was at stake during those two days? And what if he had not set the fire correctly, or if he failed.to grasp the timing accurately? One minute earlier, and Biansha would strengthen. One minute later, and Libei would weaken! Yet, he struck right at that exact timing. How could he have done it if he didn\u2019t have extraordinary insight?\u201dShen Zechuan seemed to be moved.At last, Grand Mentor Qi said, \u201cMoreover, this lad is insanely wild. When he did this, he only brought with him this many people.\u201dGrand Mentor Qi extended two fingers and paused for a moment.\u201cLanzhou, I thought Pan Rugui transferred him to the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0to avoid trouble, but it turned out to be a blunder. They thought the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0was already written off, but what was the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s background? They were all from military households who followed the Emperor back then to get into the Eight Cities. The\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0did not think much of them, so they relied on the backing of the Emperor alone. But now, the Emperor doesn\u2019t want them anymore, and so these twenty thousand men became weapons without a master. It\u2019s fine if they really fall into the hands of a hedonistic young master. But if they fall into Xiao Chiye\u2019s hand\u2026 then what else is there to deter Xiao Jiming from deploying troops to protect Prince Chu?!\u201dSo that\u2019s it!The part where Shen Zechuan had been puzzling over previously suddenly cleared up.He had thought that since Xiao Jiming left Xiao Chiye in the\u00a0Qudu, then he should understand that this was a pawn under the control of others. Either he abandoned it, or acted with prudence. If he was being prudent, then he should not and must not let Xiao Chiye get so close to Prince Chu. Otherwise, he would be asking for trouble. No matter what he did, he would always be on tenterhooks and cleaning up messes.\u201cThis bout of autumn chill in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0is about to break out in full fury. We lack influence and power, so it\u2019d be best to steer clear of it.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi\u2019s mouth was parched. He continued, \u201cBecause of the Imperial College incident, a distance has already formed between the Empress Dowager and Xi Gu\u2019an, as well as with His Majesty. In order to ensure that her authority does not decline, the matter of the imperial heir would be of emergency. If anything were to happen to Prince Chu these days, then the Xiao Clan\u2019s efforts would have been in vain, much like drawing water with a sieve. So it would seem that Xiao Chiye\u2019s urgency to meet you today must have been because he was already on the alert. However, the Empress Dowager herself is more wary and sensitive. Back then, to let Prince Ning ascend to the throne, she did not hesitate to exterminate everyone from the Eastern Palace. So, today, to guard against the unexpected, she will also wipe out Prince Chu. Xiao Chiye wants to ensure Prince Chu\u2019s safety, but I\u2019m afraid that it won\u2019t be an easy feat to achieve.\u201d\u201cSince the Empress Dowager will not use Xi Gu\u2019an, then the only one left is Ji Lei.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes were calm. \u201cThe experts in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are as plentiful as clouds. And they are clean and efficient in their jobs.\u201d\u201cThe fight between those in power is one thing.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to decide whether to pursue Prince Chu or follow the Empress Dowager.\u201dShen Zechuan extended his hand and covered the map.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 : Autumn HuntIt rained several times in the tenth month of the lunar year, following which the maple leaves in Mount Feng turned red. Shen Zechuan had already caught sight of some slight frost while herding the elephants during the\u00a0morning court. Emperor Xiande\u2019s illness improved somewhat along with the coming of autumn. Word had it that his meals had resumed, and his coughing during the\u00a0morning court\u00a0had eased off a lot.According to tradition, the Emperor could only head to the Nanlin1\u00a0Hunting Grounds only in the eleventh month. But Emperor Xiande seemed to be worried that traveling might prove difficult in cold weather, so he gave orders for the preparations of the Autumn Hunt to be carried out at the start of the tenth month.\u201cThe ones responsible for patrol duty are still the Eight Great Training Divisions and the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards.\u201d Chen Yang carried the blade for Xiao Chiye and said, \u201cViceroy, didn\u2019t His Majesty flew into a rage the last time?\u201d\u201cThat was last time.\u201d Xiao Chiye had just come from the military drill grounds. He wiped his sweat. \u201cHis Majesty was furious last time because he felt that there were safety concerns both on the inside and on the outside. But it\u2019s different this time. Xi Gu\u2019an had been despised and shunned by Her Majesty. Having been left out in the cold for two months, he will be desperately wanting to put himself back into the limelight.\u201d\u201cAre such small favors able to move Xi Gu\u2019an?\u201d When Chen Yang saw no one nearby, he said, \u201cAfter all, Her Majesty has been gaining power for a long time, and His Majesty is ill. Even if he is willing to hand Xi Gu\u2019an an olive branch, Xi Gu\u2019an wouldn\u2019t dare to accept it, would he?\u201d\u201cYou said it yourself, that it\u2019s a small favor.\u201d Xiao Chiye put on the outer garment he had grabbed. \u201cWhat if His Majesty gave Xi Gu\u2019an great power and authority? A few days ago, His Majesty even asked about the age of the Xi Clan\u2019s daughter. Prince Chu does not have a Princess Consort. If he really bestowed marriage upon them, then even if Xi Gu\u2019an did not have the intent to, it would appear differently to Her Majesty.\u201dChen Yang said, \u201cA pity we don\u2019t have a Missy at home.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better that way.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cIf I were to have a sister, she would have to be like Commander-in-Chief Qi. Otherwise, she would have no control over her life. Most likely, she will be forced to marry a husband she has never seen before.\u201d2Having said to this point, he slowed his pace.\u201cThe\u00a0 Hua Clan has always been the first choice for imperial concubines. At this age, Hua Xiangyi, who has been raised and nurtured by the Empress Dowager, has yet to be bestowed a marriage. Even His Majesty does not dare to offend her and could only call her his younger sister. When it comes to whom she will be betrothed to in the future, it\u2019s Her Majesty\u2019s arrangements that they still have to go along with.\u201dChen Yang said, \u201cFortunately, our\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0is already married\u2026 But who else can Third Missy Hua be betrothed to? Viceroy, I really can\u2019t tell at all. \u201c\u201cThe Qi Clan is the best choice.\u201d Xiao Chiye smiled. \u201cIf Qi Zhuyin was born a man, the Empress Dowager would have long betrothed Third Missy Hua to her. A pity Qi Zhuyin is a girl, and the Hua Clan does not have any man of lawful birth in this generation. So they can only eye this piece of meat but not move their chopsticks. They are getting anxious.\u201dThe horse was led over, and Xiao Chiye stroked it.\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go to the East Market on Donglong Street again.\u201dShen Zechuan had only just stepped into Donglong Street.Having been released from his imprisonment, he could naturally no longer stay in Zhao Zui Temple. As no one mentioned it at the outset, this matter was set aside. But in the eighth month, Qiao Tianya suddenly took notice of it and followed him to Zhao Zui Temple. When he saw Grand Mentor Qi all covered in mud acting like a lunatic, he got Shen Zechuan to open an account in advance with the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0so that he could find a proper place to live in. Thus, at the end of the ninth month, Shen Zechuan moved to an old alley. The rent was cheap, and the place, suitable for his current status.\u201cWho exactly is this person\u00a0Shifu\u00a0wants me to find?\u201d Shen Zechuan took the indenture3\u00a0and looked at the word \u201cSongyue\u201d. The place of origin above was blank.Ge Qingqing looked around the crowd and said, \u201cUncle didn\u2019t mention it either. He only said that the teacher has permitted it. That is, to let this person take care of your daily living in the future.\u201dAfter Shen Zechuan moved out of Zhao Zui Temple, it became inconvenient for him to communicate with Grand Mentor Qi. He was unwilling to raise messenger pigeons. Firstly, it was too easy to expose themselves, and secondly, Xiao Chiye\u2019s gyrfalcon was too fierce\u2014it left a deep impression on him. At present, they could only rely on Ji Gang and meet up when Ji Gang used his identity as an errand-runner to venture outdoors to make purchases. It was extremely inconvenient, but they had no better option for the time being.\u201cHe should be in the East Market.\u201d Shen Zechuan said to Ge Qingqing. \u201cLet\u2019s go for a look.\u201dDonglong Street was near Kailing River. It was a pleasure district. There was a trading market set up on the eastern side to deal in \u201chuman goods\u201d. Those who were selling themselves to bury their parents would also choose this place to kneel.4\u00a0Because the common households and residences would all come here to pick errand-runners or maidservants.Xiao Chiye gripped a register of names from Prince Chu\u2019s residence with the intention to come here to investigate some of the men\u2019s origins.He had only just strode out of the middleman\u2019s place when he saw a familiar nape.Chen Yang said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye raised his hand, and Chen Yang fell silent.Shen Zechuan kept the indenture. Feeling a chill on his nape, he looked back. Xiao Chiye was already standing behind him.\u201cOh, a bigwig.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cWhy are you standing behind me?\u201d\u201cLooking at you.\u201d Xiao Chiye stuffed away the register in passing and strolled over to Shen Zechuan\u2019s side. \u201cAre you here to buy servants?\u201dShen Zechuan said, as if in jest, \u201cI\u2019m selling myself. How on earth can I afford to buy someone?\u201d\u201cAlready reduced to such a state, huh?\u201d Xiao Chiye sized him up. \u201cIsn\u2019t it said that many people are seeking you at high prices?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all about the feels.\u201d Shen Zechuan continued to walk. \u201cThey have to catch my eye before I can decide whether to receive them or not.\u201d5Xiao Chiye knew what kind of men they were and said, \u201cIt sure isn\u2019t easy to choose between the ugly and the repulsive, is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m no match for the Second Young Master.\u201d Shen Zechuan looked askance at him. \u201cFollowing Prince Chu must have given you your fair share of flesh.\u201d6Xiao Chiye said, \u201cEnvious? Come look for me.\u201dShen Zechuan smiled too and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t been reduced to that stage yet.\u201dBoth men had almost arrived at the end. Shen Zechuan turned aside and said, \u201cThen I won\u2019t bother Second Young Master to accompany me further. I\u2019m heading back.\u201d\u201cNo hurry.\u201d Xiao Chiye remained where he was. \u201cThis Autumn Hunt, we still have to look out for each other.\u201d\u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0and the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0have no common ground.\u201d Shen Zechuan looked at him. \u201cSo what is there for me to look out for you?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cHow distant. If I often go over to you to stretch my legs, we can come to share a common ground.\u201dShen Zechuan did not answer him. After he left, Xiao Chiye was still rooted at the same spot.\u201cWho is he looking for in this place?\u201d Xiao Chiye gently stroked the hilt of the blade with his thumb. \u201cGe Qingqing\u2026 As expected, it\u2019s Ge Qingqing. Chen Yang.\u201d\u201cHere!\u201d\u201cGo and check it out.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cLook into all eighteen generations of Ge Qingqing\u2019s ancestors.\u201d7After Shen Zechuan\u2019s search for the man had been disrupted by Xiao Chiye, he was placed on consecutive rotational duties, and so he did not manage to find any more free time. On the eve of the Autumn Hunt, it was finally his turn to receive an assignment. Sure enough, it was to accompany the Emperor to the Nanlin Hunting Grounds.One day, Shen Zechuan got off work and returned home. Before pushing the door open, he sensed the presence of someone else in the house.With a cloak around him, Feng Quan drank his tea with his fingers sticking up8\u00a0and said from the other side of the door, \u201cAren\u2019t you coming in?\u201dShen Zechuan pushed the door open. There was no light lit in the house. With his snow-white face immersed in the darkness, Feng Quan looked like a wandering soul.He set aside the tea and said, \u201cI\u2019m here to convey a message from Her Majesty.\u201dShen Zechuan threw his dirty robe on the small clothes rack9\u00a0with curvy raised ends and said, \u201cThank you for the trouble.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Feng Quan looked at Shen Zechuan maliciously and tossed him an object. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t a matter of urgency, would I have needed to come in person? You have been graced with so many favors from the Empress Dowager. And now it\u2019s time to repay it all one at a time. If this matter falls through this Autumn Hunt, then you won\u2019t be able to survive through it either.\u201dShen Zechuan caught the object. It was an eastern pearl10\u00a0wrapped in a strip of cloth. A wipe of his fingertip revealed the ink traces of half a character on the strip of cloth\u2014Lin.11\u2014Chu.12Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes shifted back to Feng Quan\u2019s face.Feng Quan stood up and walked over to Shen Zechuan. He said, \u201cIf you succeed, the Empress Dowager can still spare your life and treat you like a dog to order around. But if you fail, then there\u2019s no point in keeping you.\u201d\u201cMartial arts experts will be as plentiful as trees in a forest.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201dFeng Quan stared daggers at him for a while before he let out a mocking smile. He strode out of the door, shook on his cloak, and melted away into the darkness of the night.Shen Zechuan lit a lamp and stood by the side of the table as he burned away the strip of cloth.The tongue of the flame licked the fabric, turning the word \u201clin\u201d into ashes.The Nanlin Hunting Grounds was located on the southeast side of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0and encompassed a wide area. Half of the usual ingredients used by the Court of Imperial Entertainments came from this place. The Eight Great Training Division forces, half of which had been mobilized, followed after the Emperor in a grand display of might.Shen Zechuan was herding the elephants when he heard the thunderous sounds of galloping horse hooves. He did not have to look back to know whose horse it was. Sure enough, he saw the gyrfalcon swoop over his head and haul up a wild mouse from among the grass before it went soaring into the sky again.Xiao Chiye and Li Jianheng, along with a group of rich young masters from\u00a0Qudu, spurred their horses past him and noisily dashed straight ahead. The jet-black steed with a snow-white patch on its chest under him was truly a conspicuous sight.Xiaowu looked up in envy and said, \u201cThis Viceroy Xiao\u2019s eagle and horse are all wonderful treasures!\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cAll wild animals.\u201dXiaowu was young and could not stand loneliness, so he was always wanting to converse with Shen Zechuan. Sitting on the horse, he munched on dried sweet potatoes13\u00a0and said in a Huaizhou accent, \u201cChuan-ge, do you know the names of that horse and eagle?\u201dShen Zechuan smiled and said, \u201cThey are wild\u2026 there\u2019s only so much they can be called.\u201dXiaowu stretched his body out and said expressively, \u201cThat eagle is called Meng! Don\u2019t you think it sounds fierce? But that horse\u2019s name isn\u2019t fierce. It\u2019s called\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin.\u201dHe enunciated each word, sounding so childlike that it amused the group of adults.Gasping for breath, Li Jianheng looked back and said to Xiao Chiye, \u201cMan, each time I see him, I always wonder why he wasn\u2019t born a woman!\u201dXiao Chiye turned around the horse and looked at Li Jianheng.Li Jianheng said, \u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m not befuddled to that extent!\u201d\u201cWhen we arrive at the venue in a moment.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cYou have to tell me when you venture out. Don\u2019t stray away from the guards around night time. Not one of the women you brought must be allowed into the tent either.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t bring a woman along.\u201d Li Jianheng put on a bold front to quibble.Xiao Chiye threw him an indescribably wicked smile.Behind them, Chen Yang spurred his horse on and caught up to them. He said, \u201cViceroy, I\u2019ve gotten someone to send all those women back.\u201dUpset, Li Jianheng bit the tip of his tongue. After a while, he said, \u201cCe\u2019an, honestly speaking, if you won\u2019t even let me sleep with them, then what fun is there to be had at the Autumn Hunt?\u201d\u201cPlenty.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cEven basking in the sun is more interesting than you being cooped up in the tent.\u201dLi Jianheng kept sighing as he continued on, listless and dejected, with the rest of the journey.When they arrived, it was nearly dark.Shen Zechuan was not on duty on the first day, so he stayed behind to do odd jobs. Qiao Tianya came too and called the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0over to treat them to some meat.He saw the bowl in Shen Zechuan\u2019s hand and suddenly said, \u201cSo you can drink, huh.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cJust a bowl.\u201dQiao Tianya did not expose him. This man did not look like an Imperial Bodyguard. He was more like someone from the\u00a0martial fraternity.\u00a0 He used a dagger to wipe the roast meat and said, \u201cEat all you can now that you are at the hunting ground! This happens only once a year. What you are eating is all stuff the palace usually uses. So seize the opportunity before you miss it.\u201dHe chewed on the meat and said.\u201cYou have to bring a blade while you are on duty. When your turn comes tomorrow night, use Qingqing\u2019s blade. Why didn\u2019t you bring one? Didn\u2019t the Domesticated Elephants Office teach you two stances?\u201d\u201cThe blade is too heavy.\u201d Looking as though he was too weak to lift it, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cIt\u2019s too much for me to carry it along with me.\u201d\u201cThe bones in your body\u2026\u201d Qiao Tianya said, \u201cCouldn\u2019t have been broken by that kick of Second Young Master Xiao, could it? What a pity. That\u2019s a first-grade hoodlum, we can\u2019t extort him. Otherwise, with that one kick, this older brother can fleece him out of all his family fortune.\u201dThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0around them laughed.Shen Zechuan moved the corners of his lips. As he sipped the wine, he took a quick look around along the rim of the bowl.All of them were inseparable from their blades.Other than him, who else was here to kill Prince Chu? Apart from those present here, there were still the assassins in the unseen shadows, and how many of them were lying in wait with cool detachment? Even if Xiao Chiye was a natural-born talent, what were the odds that he could successfully protect Prince Chu under this heavy siege?Several tents away, Xiao Chiye and Li Jianheng were still drinking wine and playing dice with the others.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 : ThunderThe next morning, Emperor Xiande assumed personal command over the Autumn Hunt\u2019s arena. His health did not permit him to go hunting on a horse, so he prepared some rewards and ordered the men present to head to the hunting grounds to try their luck at winning a prize.Li Jianheng could not get on his horse and had to make several attempts before he could hoist himself onto it. Emperor Xiande looked at him and said, \u201cJianheng will lead by example. I\u2019ll be waiting to have a taste of your prey!\u201dLi Jianheng gripped the reins. He had already given instructions to his guards. Even if he could not hit a target, he would not return empty-handed. So he set out in high spirits with a bunch of guards following closely behind him. Xiao Chiye rode his horse beside him.There was a stretch of forest at the end of the vast expanse of grassland at the Nanlin Hunting Grounds. Morning dews hung on branches and leaves that had yellowed. Startled by the shouts and sounds of horses\u2019 hooves, prey of all sizes that had been set loose scattered among the undergrowth.Clenching his bow as he sat on his horse, Li Jianheng drew the string apart with great effort and fired an arrow at a rabbit. The arrow jabbed feebly into the ground some distance away from the rabbit. Blind applause and cheers first rang out at the sides, then the guard who had gone over to take a look brought back a rabbit that had been prepared in advance.Satisfied, Li Jianheng said to Xiao Chiye, \u201cMy archery skill isn\u2019t bad, right? It was Imperial Grandpa who taught me back then!\u201dXiao Chiye said sincerely, \u201cI have never seen such a display of archery prowess even in Libei.\u201dLi Jianheng immediately laughed and said, \u201cYou have been in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0for so long, you couldn\u2019t have forgotten how to draw a bow, could you?\u201dXiao Chiye had only brought an ordinary bow along. It was not even as good as the ones the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0used. He said, \u201cLet me show you my skill too.\u201dWith that, Xiao Chiye drew his bow and fired an arrow at the clearing before him. His shot was even weaker than Prince Chu\u2019s; it did not even stab into the ground. Blind cheers and exaltation rang out from the sides again. Xiao Chiye reveled in it.Qian Tianya had already grown impatient waiting behind them. Amused when he saw this scene, he said, \u201cSee that? If you don\u2019t train well, you\u2019ll be treated like a fool!\u201dLooking at Xiao Chiye\u2019s shoulders and arms, Shen Zechuan was once again reminded of that piece of bone thumb ring. He could not help but smile.Prince Chu had not ridden for long when his back ached. It dampened his willingness to go further. This was the result of having too much to drink last night. At the moment, he was not feeling well all over. He led the horse and wandered around aimlessly for a while, enduring it until it was almost time before he urged his men back.The guards at the back had not even finished shooting all their arrows when they escorted him back like a gust of wind. They did not even head to the forest in the east.Li Jianheng dismounted the horse and kneeled before the Emperor. At the side, Pan Rugui made an inventory count of the prey for Emperor Xiande. The more Li Jianheng heard, the more pleased he was. He said, \u201cImperial Elder Brother! There\u2019s even a red fox. What an excellent fur color. It\u2019ll make the perfect fur collar for you.\u201dEmperor Xiande was pleased too. He said, \u201cI feel even more spirited now than I was back in\u00a0Qudu! Pan Rugui, give the stuff to Prince Chu.\u201dLi Jianheng lifted the silk fabric with great delight, only to see a great bow no ordinary man could draw presented underneath. He instantly lost interest, although he still had to say, \u201cThank you Your Majesty for the reward!\u201dEmperor Xiande laughed and coughed a few times before saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t like it? This isn\u2019t meant for you to use either. This bow was left behind by the Great Ancestor Emperor1\u00a0in the early years. It\u2019s made of black iron coupled with keel and weighs one hundred and twenty catty.2\u00a0Even the current Four Great Generals cannot draw it. Bestowing it upon you is because I want you to be diligent at all times. When you face this bow, remember the hardships of the Great Ancestor Emperor in his great undertaking to establish the Empire.\u201dLi Jianheng acknowledged his words and called for his men to carry the bow away.During dinner, Emperor Xiande called Li Jianheng over to sit with him and leaned against him. This was a hint that could not be any more obvious. All the officials presented knew it, but they still had to play dumb because Secretariat Elder Hua, Hua Siqian, was still on an equal footing with Prince Chu.Once everyone had their fill of wine and food, a bonfire was started.Emperor Xiande had not retreated this whole day, and so all those present could not leave either. Li Jianheng had already grown tired of sitting, but then, he saw that Emperor Xiande still had no intent to retreat for a rest.What\u2019s going on?Li Jianheng cast a questioning gaze at Xiao Chiye.Xiao Chiye pretended not to notice.By this time, the singing and dancing had already receded, and the flame of the bonfire was raging. Emperor Xiande suddenly gathered his clothes and called out, \u201cMy dear minister Hai.\u201dHai Liangyi tidied his robe and respectfully kneeled before the Emperor to answer, \u201cThis old subject is here!\u201dEmperor Xiande asked, \u201cWhat were you going to do today?\u201dHai Liangyi kowtowed and replied, \u201cThis old subject would like to recommend the Chief Supervising Secretary of the Six Ministries\u2019 Office of Scrutiny for Revenue, Xue Xiuzhuo, to be given the authority to submit a petition before Your Majesty!\u201dHua Siqian had already sensed something going on. He stroked his beard and said, \u201cRenshi, why put it in such a way? To begin with, the Chief Supervising Secretary has the authority to remonstrate directly with His Majesty.\u201d\u201cThat may be so.\u201d Hai Liangyi said, \u201cBut Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s memorial3\u00a0has repeatedly failed to reach His Majesty. He might as well seek a direct audience with His Majesty.\u201d\u201cHow could there be a memorial that couldn\u2019t make its way to His Majesty?\u201d Hua Siqian asked.Emperor Xiande said, \u201cI\u2019m curious too. My dear minister Hai, call him up to say his piece.\u201dHaving received the command, Pan Rugui exchanged looks with Hua Siqian and strode two steps out to call out, \u201cSummon the Chief Supervising Secretary of the Office of Scrutiny for Revenue, Xue Xiuzhuo, for an audience with His Majesty!\u201dXue Xiuzhuo was not wearing his official robe. He looked travel-worn as though he had just dismounted from his horse. He did not look at anyone when he made his way up. Instead, he kneeled first to kowtow and pay his obeisances to Emperor Xiande.\u201cWhat do you have to report?\u201d Emperor Xiande asked amid the wind.Xue Xiuzhuo said, \u201cThis subject is the Supervising Secretary of the Office of Scrutiny. My key task is to audit the financial affairs of the Ministry of Revenue in minute details. In the third month of the fifth year of Xiande,4\u00a0this subject audited the expenditure ledger for the fourth year of Xiande and discovered a subsidy of 2,000,000 taels recorded. For the sake of prudence, especially in the light of the Ministry of Revenue\u2019s statement that it was a 'subsidy to the Thirteen Cities of Juexi\u201c, this subject personally made a trip to Juexi. The Provincial Administration Commissioner of Juexi, Jiang Qingshan, conducted a reconciliation of the accounts with this subject and discovered that out of the subsidy allocated in the fourth year of Xiande, only 1,530,000 taels had been given to Juexi for real. The remaining 470,000 taels had vanished without a trace. Following this, in the eight month of the same year, the Ministry of War disbursed the salaries and provisions to the troops at the frontiers. The Ministry of Revenue allocated 2,800,000 taels for this purpose. Of that amount, 1,800,000 taels were for Qidong Five Commanderies Garrison Troops, and 1,000,000 taels were for Libei Great Commandery. But by the time this subject chased the money to Luoxia Pass after it was handed down, there were only 830,000 taels left! And this goes on, incident after incident. The deficit of the State Treasury is such a huge sum. Where has all the money gone? Who took them? Elder Secretariat Hua may be unsure, but this subject has the records to submit for His Majesty\u2019s perusal!\u201d\u201cYou are spouting nonsense!\u201d Hua Siqian denounced him in a cold tone. \u201cThe Ministry of Revenue has to reconcile the accounts at the beginning of the year right in the palace itself! How is it that you just had to be the one to know when the Minister of Revenue, Grand Secretariat, and the Brush-holding Director of the Imperial Palace\u2019s\u00a0Directorate of Ceremonial\u00a0all had no idea that there was a deficit?!\u201dHai Liangyi raised his head and said in a steady voice, \u201cThis old subject knows! Starting from the second year of Xiande, the account books submitted by the Ministry of Revenue have been split into real and fake copies. When it comes to deciding what is handed over every year, it\u2019s not the Minister of Revenue\u2019s words that counts, but yours, Hua Siqian!\u201dThe \u201ccrackle\u201d of the bonfire exploded like a sudden burst of thunder that struck everyone present into silence. None of them had expected Emperor Xiande to raise tough questions in such a manner so suddenly.\u201cFine.\u201d Hua Siqian laughed and slapped the table to get up. \u201cSo you are making up wild charges now? What Hua Faction?! All the lands in the world belong to the Emperor. I, Hua Siqian, have been open and aboveboard in everything I have done. All along, I\u2019ve placed His Majesty first! If there are any dubious accounts, take them out now. Zheng Guoshi, tally it with him!\u201dThe Minister of Revenue, Zheng Guoshi, kneeled down in a fluster and said, \u201cYour Majesty, this subject would like to ask Chief Supervising Secretary Xue a question. Since it\u2019s the accounts for the Fourth Year of Xiande that has a problem, why did he wait until today to bring it up? If there is truly a problem with it, then wouldn\u2019t he have held up a major issue!\u201dXue Xiuzhuo quickly said, \u201cNowadays, the local officials who have entered the capital do not meet their superiors nor pay obeisance to Your Majesty. Instead, they first send a visitation card5 and head over to the Hua Residence and Pan-gonggong\u2019s secondary residence to pay their respects. The Hua Faction is so powerful and influential. It may well be asked who still wouldn\u2019t dare to follow the lead of Secretariat Elder Hua?!\u201d\u201cEvery year, I have to tell the delegated Investigating Censors to just voice it out if there is a problem! What do I have to fear?! The account ledgers of my Hua Clan have all been presented before His Majesty; it\u2019s all clear and aboveboard!\u201d Hua Siqian stared at Xue Xiuzhuo. \u201cXue Yanqing, do you still remember who gave you a recommendation when you had to enter\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to be an official during the years of Yongyi? I could be partially considered your teacher, and yet you framed me like this!\u201dXue Xiuzhuo raised his head and met Hua Siqian\u2019s eyes for a moment. He said, \u201cOn the imperial court, there is only the ruler and his ministers; there is no teacher and his student.\u201dHua Siqian turned to Emperor Xiande and asked, \u201cDoes Your Majesty believe it?\u201dEmperor Xiande lowered his eyelids and said, \u201cI believe the accounts.\u201dHua Siqian raised his head and burst out laughing. He joined his palms together and said,\u00a0 \u201cFine! Your Majesty, it was a turbulent period in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0back then, and the former Emperor chose you on his deathbed. Do you still remember who was the one who supported you, who protected and escorted you all the way?! But tonight, you believed it because of a few disloyal and unfilial scums?!\u201dEmperor Xiande raised his hand to drink the tea. He finally looked at Hua Siqian. With his eyes brimming with loathing, he said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be clear whether that was protecting and escorting or coercing and commanding a prince?\u201dHua Siqian suddenly shoved aside the table and said, \u201cJi Lei!\u201dThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0at the feast drew their blades with a swoosh.Hai Liangyi said, \u201cThe audacity of you to rebel!\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d Hua Siqian said. \u201cBut you are already forcing the blades right at me now. Surely you don\u2019t expect me to sit and wait to be killed, do you?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Emperor Xiande said coldly, \u201cXi Gu\u2019an!\u201dThe Eight Great Training Divisions suddenly strode a step forward to stand before the Emperor.\u201cTake down Hua Siqian!\u201d Emperor Xiande commanded.\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d Hua Siqian bellowed. \u201cXi Gu\u2019an, your wife and child are now having tea with the Empress Dowager. If you dare to take another step forward, the lineage of the Xi Clan will be severed! The Empress Dowager has treated you well over the years, but you have been repeatedly instigated by others. It is still not too late for you to turn back.\u201dXi Gu\u2019an had originally been forced and left without a choice. Now, he took a slight step back, afraid.Emperor Xiande said in a sinister voice, \u201cNot too late? Xi Gu\u2019an, was it not too late for the former Crown Prince? Was it not too late for Shen Wei? Which of them weren\u2019t more loyal than you were?! They retreated, but did the Empress Dowager let them off? I have already asked them to draft an imperial edict. As long as Prince Chu ascended to the throne in the future, the daughter of the Xi Clan will be the Empress of the Empire!\u201d\u201cIt has already become a usual practice for His Majesty to issue and rescind his orders. And you still dare to harbor such wishful thinking?!\u201d Hua Siqian flicked his sleeves. \u201cHis Majesty has gone muddle-headed from his illness! Imperial Concubine Wei is already half-a-month pregnant, so how can Prince Chu ascend to the throne?!\u201dXi Gu\u2019an gripped his blade. His forehead was drenched in sweat.Layers and layers of dark clouds had already shrouded the night sky. The wind before the eve of a rainstorm ceased too. Banners of flags at the hunting grounds flapped. No one moved.Gritting his teeth, Xi Gu\u2019an drew out his blade and turned to Emperor Xiande. With some difficulty, he said, \u201cThe illness of His Majesty is\u2026 beyond cure.\u201d\u201cI gave you a chance.\u201d Emperor Xiande looked at Xi Gu\u2019an and gradually began to laugh. The more he laughed, the louder he became. And the louder he was, the more he coughed. He braced himself against the table and said frostily, \u201cIf I did not have total confidence when I came to this Autumn Hunt, then how could I hunt down and kill treacherous ministers and traitors like you?! Qi Zhuyin is already leading the troops over to come to my aid. She should be here within four hours! So who are you killing? Hm? Who dares to?!\u201dJi Lei suddenly piped up. \u201cCommander-in-Chief Qi is far away in the Cangjun Commandery in Qidong. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are responsible for all incoming and outgoing correspondences. Your Majesty, it\u2019s time for you to wake up from your dreams!\u201dEmperor Xiande glared furiously at him and said, \u201cQi\u2026\u201dPan Rugui suddenly covered Emperor Xiande\u2019s mouth and forced him to sit down. He looked around the crowd and smiled. \u201cHis Majesty is having a relapse of his illness.\u201dAll the civil servants\u2019 legs were trembling. Hua Siqian looked at Li Jianheng and grinned nastily as he said, \u201cPrince Chu harbored the intent to stage a revolt at the hunting grounds. He even brought a bow and arrows along. The evidence against him is conclusive! What are you waiting for? Kill him!\u201dExcept for the guards beside him, the cold gleams of blades suddenly erupted all around.Li Jianheng dropped his chopsticks in shock. As he retreated, he tumbled onto the ground along with his seat. He said, \u201cSecretariat, Secretariat Elder! I have no intent to proclaim myself the Emperor!\u201d\u201cYour Highness.\u201d Hua Siqian said, \u201cDo you know how the four words, \u2018in spite of oneself\u2019 is written?\u201dThunder exploded in the sky.Hearing the swarm of footsteps towards him, Li Jianheng hid among his guards. He could not even stand up as he said in a teary voice, \u201cI\u2019m an idle prince by nature! So why go to such an extent?\u201dThe gleam of a blade flashed past before him, and Li Jianheng held his head and yelled. But then, he heard a tremendous crash, and the table before him overturned with a \u201cbang\u201d. Someone gripped his back collar and lifted him up.\u201cHis Majesty bestowed the Conqueror Bow upon you, and so you are the Crown Prince of Dazhou!\u201d Xiao Chiye let out a sinister smile. \u201cAs the Viceroy of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0in\u00a0Qudu, I, Xiao Ce\u2019an, want to see who will meet their fates under this blade of mine! Chen Yang, help the Crown Prince up the horse!\u201d\u201cXiao the Second.\u201d\u00a0 Ji Lei slowly drew out his blade. \u201cOn account of the friendship between us, do you have to do this tonight?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been fooling around for so long.\u201d Xiao Chiye released Li Jianheng. \u201cI\u2019m itching for a fight.\u201d6\u201cCapture him.\u201d Ji Lei said, \u201cAs long as there is no danger to the Second Young Master\u2019s life, it\u2019s fine to break his arms and legs.\u201dXiao Chiye took off his cumbersome outer robe, only to reveal a body-fitting\u00a0jinzhuang7\u00a0underneath. He cast a glance around and said, \u201cWhoever is able to break my arms and legs, I will not only award him a hundred taels of gold, but also call him Master.\u201dLangli Blade, which had almost never once left its sheath in\u00a0Qudu, steadily slid out. Inch by inch, light the color of snow glinted, along with a frosty, murderous aura that intimidated.\u201cBut if he can\u2019t break them, then his life is forfeited.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 : DownpourA gale assailed across the grass of the hunting grounds. The instant the flame leaped, the sudden sound of blades colliding against one another erupted.The feast was thrown into chaos. Hai Liangyi climbed up from the ground. With a burst of unexpected energy, he slammed headlong into Pan Rugui and bellowed, \u201cCastrated traitor! Don\u2019t hurt my Lord!\u201dLi Jianheng was on the horse, trembling all over as he watched the glinting and flashing display of cold steels. Clinging on to the horse\u2019s neck, he closed his eyes and cried out, \u201cCe\u2019an! Ce\u2019an, save me!\u201dAll of a sudden, Xiao Chiye kicked Ji Lei back into a retreat. Without even looking back, he backhandedly stabbed the Imperial Bodyguard who was attempting to launch a sneak attack behind him and snuffed the life out of the latter. Warm blood spattered over half of his body. He pulled out\u00a0Langli Blade, took two steps forward, and struck the Eight Great Training Divisions soldier charging at him to the ground.Chen Yang had already flipped atop the horse. He hauled Li Jianheng up, whistled at the top of his voice, and shouted to Prince Chu\u2019s guards, \u201cFollow me to protect His Highness. We\u2019ll break through the siege towards the east!\u201dBefore the horses could move, Ji Lei said in a cold voice, \u201cStop him\u2014\u201dJi Lei had yet to finish his word when he saw a blade slashing down on him. He held up his blade horizontally to block it. The next moment, both his arms sank down heavily as Xiao Chiye\u2019s blow pained and numbed them. A sound escaped from Ji Lei\u2019s throat as the impact sent him staggering. Astonished, he looked before him.Xiao the Second!\u201cYou played dumb to exploit the situation for your own ends.\u201d Ji Lei crouched abruptly with legs astride and forcibly lifted his blade. He bellowed in fury, \u201cI\u2019ve misjudged you!\u201dA gust of wind assaulted from the side, and Xiao Chiye turned his head to dodge the attack. He swept the edge of his blade in a diagonal arc on his right, and a stream of glistening blood followed in its trajectory. Following right after, his blade collided with Ji Lei\u2019s once again.Lang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0charged in, knocked over the table, and dragged the tablecloth along with it as it galloped through the bonfire. In that moment, the fire surged, setting tents and withered grass on fire. The very instant\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0brushed past him, Xiao Chiye flipped atop its back. With the back of his blade, he swatted the buttocks of the horse Prince Chu was on and said a deep voice, \u201cGo!\u201d\u201cProtect His Majesty!\u201d Xue Xiuzhuo strode over to pull Hai Liangyi away. \u201cElder Hai! Let us go to protect His Majesty!\u201dEmperor Xiande gasped for breath. His lips and face were pale. Xue Xiuzhuo squatted down to hoist Emperor Xiande over his shoulder and fled from the fire along with the other civil officials.Xi Gu\u2019an wanted to give chase, but Hua Siqian pointed directly at Prince Chu and said, \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s fate is sealed, so there\u2019s no need for us to kill or not kill him. But Prince Chu must die tonight! If he escapes, then you and I will be labeled as the traitorous party! Ji Lei, gather the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0and join forces with the two thousand Garrison Troops in the City of Tuancheng to surround the hunting grounds. You must kill Prince Chu! Xi Gu\u2019an, hurry back to the capital at top speed! The Eight Great Training Divisions will take charge of protecting\u00a0Qudu!\u201dBy the time he spoke to this point, he had calmed down.\u201cWe have the imperial heir in our hands, and the Empress Dowager in command. As long\u00a0Qudu\u00a0doesn\u2019t fall into chaos, even Qi Zhuyin herself will not be able to act rashly if Prince Chu dies! As for the Xiao Clan, there will be plenty of opportunities to deal with them in the future!\u201dThe stench of blood on Xiao Chiye was thick and heavy. His lips were tightly pursed as he killed everyone in his path the entire journey. Whoever dared to block his way,\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0would decapitate that person, regardless of whose camp they were in!Li Jianheng\u2019s stomach lurched. But he covered his lips and did not dare to puke.The remaining forty men at the sides were all Xiao Chiye\u2019s personal guards. The steed under his legs galloped away without a moment\u2019s pause. Behind them, the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0followed hot on their tails.Just as their group galloped to the front of the forest, Xiao Chiye suddenly commanded, \u201cScatter!\u201dThe remaining forty men tore off their guard attires in unison to reveal riding outfits that were exactly the same as Li Jianheng\u2019s. Then, the procession dispersed with a loud clamor and charged into the forest from various spots.With dark clouds shrouding the moon, there was no way anyone could tell the direction in which Prince Chu had fled under the darkness, especially from a distance away.Ji Lei reined in his horse outside the forest and turned his head aside to spit. He said, \u201cSurround the hunting grounds! Dig deep and search! If you encounter Xiao the Second, don\u2019t engage him in a one-on-one fight. Form a team of at least four men and attack him from all sides!\u201dBranches kept whipping across his face, hurting Li Jianheng so much that he kept using his arm to shield his face. The surrounding guards had already dispersed, leaving only Xiao Chiye and Chen Yang beside him.\u201cDismount.\u201d Xiao Chiye lifted Li Jianheng and threw him to the ground to let Chen Yang take over.Li Jianheng tumbled until even his head was soiled with dirt and earth. He said in a plaintive voice, \u201cCe\u2019an, Ce\u2019an, what are you going to do?\u201d\u201cYour Highness, please follow me.\u201d Chen Yang pulled Li Jianheng up. \u201cIt\u2019s too conspicuous to travel on a horse through the forest! The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are experts at encirclement and assassination. Riding a horse is like being a live target. We can\u2019t take this risk!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not leaving!\u201d Li Jianheng fearfully yanked his arm back and pleaded, \u201cCe\u2019an, you are the only one who can protect me!\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cKnock him out and carry him away!\u201dWith that, he turned the horse around without waiting for Li Jianheng to reply and galloped away deeper into the forest.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Lightning flashed in the sky, illuminating the sinister forest with layers upon layers of spooky shadows. The sounds of horses\u2019 hooves, of blades being drawn, and of men dashing rang out in succession. The only thing missing was the sound of people speaking.A whiff of the impending rainstorm wafted through the dark night. Xiao Chiye did not know how long he had been fleeing for.\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0gradually came to a halt.Dead silence suddenly descended all around.Raindrops came pelting down from the sky, and a drop shot down before Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes. The darkness, amid that soundless drip, looked as if a monstrous creature was creeping slowly out of it. Countless\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0stalked towards Xiao Chiye like a tightly woven net of oppressive darkness spreading towards him.No one gave orders.Rain pattered down, and the sharp end of a Xiuchun Blade1\u00a0sliced through the water droplets. In the twinkling of an eye, it reached the side of Xiao Chiye\u2019s neck.At the same time Xiao Chiye bent his head,\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0left its sheath. With a \u201cclang\u201d, the back of the blade halted the retracting momentum of the Xiuchun Blade. He pressed\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0back into its sheath again. There was an ear-piercing sound of scraping as the damaged sharp edge of the Xiuchun Blade cracked. Along with its master, it was kicked back. Both tumbled and fell into the rainwater.Numerous figures abruptly leaped up from all four sides of his horse.Xiao Chiye clapped his palm on the back of the horse. His entire body leaped out of the saddle, and once again,\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0left its sheath. This time, the glint of the blade swept across, splitting open skin and flesh in a ring around him. Blood spattered onto his face and trickled down to his chin along with the sound of human bodies dropping.Xiao Chiye landed back onto the back of the horse but did not sit on it. Instead, he maintained a crouching posture with the edge of his blade partially sheathed.The sound of breathing. The pattering of rain.In this pitch-dark night where one was as good as blindfolded, Xiao Chiye had already used his ears and hearing to its maximum capacity. Not one of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0who had been wounded earlier made a sound. Those closely woven footsteps circled around him a short distance away, forming an indestructible encirclement with him in its center.He who was impatient right this moment would expose his weakness.Xiao Chiye waited in silence, and it was in this moment that Qiao Tianya, who was hiding in the darkness, truly realized what being a lone wolf meant.Xiao Chiye was so unhurried and calm that it was as if the more precarious and dangerous the situation he found himself in, the more cool-headed and unpredictable he could be. And that blade of his was the fangs he bared this very night.Qiao Tianya felt a rare sense of restlessness. The source of this fretfulness came from his order not to kill Xiao Chiye. It was far harder to trap and thwart this kind of dangerous predator than to kill him. Because more often than not, there was only one chance they had to get close to him. If they could not take him down, then they would end up slaughtered by this man.Qiao Tianya closed his eyes. When he opened them again, ruthlessness brimmed in them.He pulled out his own Xiuchun Blade and took a step out. The next moment, there was a flash of his figure as he burst into action and hacked down on Xiao Chiye\u2019s back with a lightning move of his hand.Xiao Chiye reversed his blade to parry the blow and turned around to kick Qiao Tianya on his abdomen. The men from the remaining three sides slashed their blades down on him in unison. He stopped the blades with one arm, but someone saw an opening on his left and sliced the sharp end of his blade towards his face. Xiao Chiye struck his elbow at the side of the blade. The blade swung sideways along with Xiao Chiye\u2019s elbow as he slammed the other man in the face with it and sent the latter flipping over to the ground.Once again, Qiao Tianya followed closely on his heels.The rain fell in torrents. There was no shouting, only the sound of blades. Rainwater had scrubbed away at Xiao Chiye\u2019s facial features until they looked all the more ferocious. In this never-ending encirclement, he maintained the acuity that was specific to him and him alone. Time and time again, he warded off the onslaught of assault led by Qiao Tianya, moving in the darkness as though he was treading on thin ice.Qiao Tianya pressed on with his offensive. They were indeed experts at drawn-out encirclement. Was a lone wolf terrifying? They just had to surround him and wear down his patience and calmness into nothingness. He would surely reveal a weak point once they tire him out with their never-ending attacks!Pressure from the intense flurry of blades gradually made Xiao Chiye breathless. The downpour masked some of the finer details in the surroundings, like the crossbow being pulled out under the cover of darkness.The more Xiao Chiye fought, the more fierce he was. The blood under his blade flowed endlessly. But all of a sudden, Qiao Tianya waved his hand and led the group of black shadows into a withdrawal, plunging Xiao Chiye once again into a silence without human voices to rattle his soaring fighting spirit.The rainwater glided across the back of his hands. Xiao Chiye could no longer hear the footsteps. Heavy rain drenched him thoroughly. Under him,\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0anxiously treaded its hooves.\u201cTwang.\u201dThe sound from the crossbow trigger was very soft, yet Xiao Chiye seemed as though he had heard a deafening sound. He suddenly slapped his horse.\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0leaped away, but he rolled off the horse instead. In a flash, there was a succession of \u201cthud, thud, thud\u201d as a row of short arrows stabbed into the muddied water behind him.Xiao Chiye wiped away the rain on his face, only to hear the sounds of \u201ctwang\u201d from all directions. He leaped up at once and darted away.The irritating footsteps followed him relentlessly!An arrow suddenly grazed Xiao Chiye\u2019s arm. At the same time a gash of blood materialized, he felt a twinge of numbing itch.Anesthetic!They were really treating him like a violent beast to subdue and capture!There was a dip in the terrain ahead. Xiao Chiye sprang up with all his might and leaped across the ditch. He had only just landed on his feet when a sudden gust of chilly wind came assaulting him from the side.Xiao Chiye seized the momentum to roll forward as a blade hacked down on the spot he was just at. Before the killer could extract his blade, there was a tightness in his throat as Xiao Chiye shoved him down into the muddied water and broke his neck.A jumble of arrows stabbed into the tree trunk beside him. Before Xiao Chiye could get up, he was suddenly kicked in the back. Caught by surprise by the man behind him, he tumbled into the undergrowth. But in this brief period of oversight, he braced himself against the ground to steady himself.When Xiao Chiye got a clear look at the man before him, he licked away the traces of blood between his teeth and called out to him as though they were lovers, \u201cOh, Lanzhou.\u201dShen Zechuan was also bracing himself on the ground with a hand. A thin blade was sandwiched between his fingers. He stared at Xiao Chiye in the rain and pounced.Xiao Chiye\u2019s palm was next to the hilt of his blade. But unexpectedly, Shen Zechuan was already right before him. The latter slapped back\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0with one hand and grabbed the front of Xiao Chiye\u2019s clothes with the other hand to fling him over to the ground.Mud splashed all over. Xiao Chiye hooked his arm around the back of Shen Zechuan\u2019s neck and turned the freed\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0over and sent it slashing towards Shen Zechuan.Shen Zechuan immediately pressed his body down and came face-to-face with an upside-down Xiao Chiye. The instant their eyes met, he struck the side of\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0aside with a lighting move of his hand. Blood droplets on the edge of the blade hit his face and slid along his chin to mingle with the rain before dripping onto the center of Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyebrows.The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0behind closed in on them. Shen Zechuan wanted to lift his body, but Xiao Chiye slid his palm up to press him down until they could almost hear each other\u2019s breathing.Panting slightly, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cYou want to court death with me that much?\u201dBut Shen Zechuan bowed his head and said, \u201cEven a wolf will not be able to run anymore once struck by an arrow. Your movements have slowed down by so much. You can\u2019t go on anymore, can you?\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s fingers teasingly caressed Shen Zechuan\u2019s nape. His thumb slipped to Shen Zechuan\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple and pressed against it forcefully.\u201cI can still break a neck like this.\u201dThe thick growth of grass rustled as a human figure bore his way out of it. Without even looking, Shen Zechuan raised his hand to toss out his blade. The other party instantly collapsed to the ground. The killing intent in Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes did not recede, but he pushed away Xiao Chiye\u2019s touchy-feely hand and dragged him along with him as he slid down the slope.Qiao Tianya was a little late. By the time he arrived, there were only two corpses. He briefly turned them over for a look and plucked the blade from the throat of the dead man. He narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem to belong to Xiao the Second\u2026 And how did these killers get in? Xiao the Second is the dog leash to hold Libei in check. He cannot die. Wasn\u2019t that the fucking consensus?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 : Rainy NightLightning flashed and thunder boomed. Rain poured like curtains of waterfalls.Qiao Tianya stood up and handed the blade to the man behind him to put away. He said, \u201cXiao the Second has been hit by an arrow. He won\u2019t be able to make his escape.\u201dAt the bottom of the slope, Xiao Chiye and Shen Zechuan lay prone in the mud with bated breath.Right this moment,\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0were everywhere around them, and there were also unknown assassins in hiding. It would prove to be harder than ascending to Heaven for both men to escape. But breaking through the encirclement was even tougher. The most fatal of all was Xiao Chiye. His left arm, which the arrow had grazed, was going numb. In just an hour, the drug would spread throughout his body and paralyze him.Qiao Tianya brushed aside the tousled grass with his foot and saw the messy tracks of footprints. He silently raised his hand and pointed down the slope.Behind him, the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0filed out, crouching as they slowly surrounded and edged towards that sunken ditch.Xiao Chiye\u2019s body tensed as he listened to the approaching sound of men stepping on mud. The hilt of his blade was pressed against his palm. As long as someone jumped down prematurely, he would immediately leap up like a wolf and end the other party in a single blow.The Xiuchun Blades1\u00a0had already swung their way to the edge of the slope. Xiao Chiye suddenly\u2014was stopped by Shen Zechuan who had grabbed hold of his soaked clothes. He shifted his gaze over and saw Shen Zechuan\u2019s calm eyes.Right at this moment, several figures suddenly sprang down in the forest to engage the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0in a battle. Qiao Tianya drew his sword at them and saw a flash of flying blades. Following right after, a few\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0toppled to the ground. With their morale boosted, the other party instantly pounced.Once chaos descended above them, Shen Zechuan kept away the few remaining blades he had left. Without needing him to say more, Xiao Chiye had already leaped to his feet. He climbed along the muddy slope and rolled into the thick growth of grass on the other side.\u201cCatch them!\u201d Qiao Tianya bellowed.The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0streaked across the air in a retreat. Xiao Chiye extended and hung his arms up on a tree trunk and swiftly flipped atop it. Below him, Shen Zechuan had only just reached when the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0behind him arrived too. Like a ferocious tiger springing down the mountain, Xiao Chiye swiftly hacked down on them with\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0like a heated knife cutting through butter, forcing the crowd of\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0simultaneously back in a retreat.Qiao Tianya sprang up from behind and brandished his blade to sweep it towards Xiao Chiye, who could not retract his own blade in time. Xiao Chiye abruptly ducked his head. Then there was a \u201cthud\u201d as the edge of Qiao Tianya\u2019s blade collided into a sheath.Shen Zechuan pressed his sheath against the other blade. With one foot, he stepped onto Xiao Chiye\u2019s back, whose powerful lift of his own body raised Shen Zechuan\u2019s whole body up to close in towards Qiao Tianya. The thin blade between his fingers on his other hand suddenly went assailing towards Qiao Tianya\u2019s eyes.Qiao Tianya did not dodge. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0at both sides swiftly cleaved down their blades to obstruct the attack.Having already gotten up, Xiao Chiye lifted his leg to kick Qiao Tianya right in the chest. Both parties retreated in unison. Qiao Tianya flung off the droplets of blood on his blade. The locks of hair before his forehead had already been sliced off by Shen Zechuan earlier.Xiao Chiye and Shen Zechuan took two steps back. Without even saying a word, they turned and ran.Qiao Tianya stared at their backs and said, \u201cGive chase!\u201dXiao Chiye reached out an arm to pull over Shen Zechuan and said, \u201cEast!\u201dShen Zechuan brushed aside the stray branches and said, \u201cThere\u2019s one man in every five steps and a squad in every ten. Not to forget there\u2019s still the Tuancheng Garrison Troops in the east!\u201dXiao Chiye slowly retracted his arm. He said resolutely and decisively, \u201cThe east is the way out.\u201d\u201cThe gate of death is right before us.\u201d Shen Zechuan backhandedly tossed out his blade, and the soldier hiding in an ambush in the tree promptly fell headfirst to the ground. When Shen Zechuan passed by him, he conveniently extracted the other party\u2019s Xiuchun Blade.Xiao Chiye backhandedly grasped the hilt of his blade. The next moment, he sliced through the pitch-black night to hold up two blades in the rain. He had already lost all sensations in his left arm. Even the fingers on his right hand were now slightly stiff.It would be a tough battle tonight!Shen Zechuan brandished his blade to slay the man, then kicked over the body.As Xiao Chiye strode forward, he staggered. He suddenly pressed his chest against Shen Zechuan\u2019s back and brought him tumbling into the billowing waves of grass and rolling into the stream.The rain was still falling, and penetratingly cold water scoured their bodies. Xiao Chiye\u2019s heavy breathing weighed down beside Shen Zechuan\u2019s neck, forming a bizarre duality of scalding heat and icy cold.\u201cKilling me won\u2019t do you any good.\u201d Propping himself on\u00a0Langli Blade, Xiao Chiye raised his body a little. \u201cSo I\u2019m counting on you for the rest of the journey.\u201dShen Zechuan wiped his face with the stream water and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no point in saving you either.\u201d\u201cYou are here to look for Prince Chu.\u201d When Xiao Chiye heard him, he pinned him down again. \u201cWhat\u2019s to be done? The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0can\u2019t ferret him out either. Only I know where he is. You have already missed your opportunity. No doubt the Empress Dowager will fail tonight! Dote on me. I\u2019m your way out.\u201dShen Zechuan looked back, and the tips of both men\u2019s noses came face to face with each other. He said coolly, \u201cI\u2019ll hack you to death. We can all just die together.\u201d\u201cYou expended so much effort to get out of imprisonment.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cJust to die with me in the name of love?\u201d\u201cYou might as well use that mouth to have a chat with Qiao Tianya.\u201d Shen Zechuan grasped hold of Xiao Chiye\u2019s hands with his icy fingertips. The next instant,\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0swept back and beat the pursuing troops back for a moment.Having received an opening, Shen Zechuan lifted his leg to shove Xiao Chiye aside. He grabbed Xiuchun Blade with one hand, carried\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0in the other, and calmed his panting caused by the sprint earlier.\u201cPut that life of yours on account.\u201d Shen Zechuan looked as Qiao Tianya dashed closer to them and tightened his grip on the blade. \u201cAfter tonight, I\u2019m your master.\u201dSnow-white light glinted in the ink-like night. Without giving Qiao Tianya the chance to speak, Shen Zechuan slashed down on him head-on.Sprays of water splashed along with his footsteps. Every single one of Shen Zechuan\u2019s blow was deadly. As blades collided, the edge of his Xiuchun Blade was damaged. Qiao Tianya flung it aside with his own blade and sent it flying.The two men instantly separated. Shen Zechuan\u2019s empty left hand soaked in the stream water, which washed away the blood that had trickled down.\u201cA beauty should sit high behind a curtain in a pavilion.\u201d2\u00a0 Qiao Tianya looked as though he had caught a whiff of some scent. \u201cCarrying a blade will hurt the hands. What if you break them?\u201dShen Zechuan weighed\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0with his right hand. \u201cIsn\u2019t breaking my hands and legs\u00a0 just the thing to make me compliant?\u201d\u201cThere is a kind of people in this world who cannot be provoked.\u201d Qiao Tianya said. \u201cMen like you who can even be ruthless to your own self.\u201dShen Zechuan strode forward to attack.Langli Blade\u00a0was heavy, so he could not wield it smoothly and effortlessly enough. But being heavy had its own advantage. Just like how Qiao Tianya was now too occupied to counteract his blows as he relied on the forcefulness of the Ji Clan Blade Technique to hack away at the former.As Qiao Tianya retreated, the pressure almost made him fold over backwards. However, the moment he drew near to the stream, he had an ill sense of foreboding. Sure enough, he saw Shen Zechuan\u2019s injured left hand suddenly splashed up from the water. The dirty mud spattered into Qiao Tianya\u2019s eyes, causing him to momentarily expose a weak point. Then, his chest received yet another heavy blow as Shen Zechuan kicked him down and sent him crashing into the stream.When reinforcements arrived, Shen Zechuan retreated a few steps. He would definitely not persist in engaging in combat, so he started dragging Xiao Chiye in an attempt to leave. How could he have expected Xiao Chiye to be so tall with such long legs that he could barely hoist him away?\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8The search intensified, and time passed particularly slowly.Everyone they found in the entire forest was all smokescreens. What\u2019s more, they were well-trained men who would give their lives for the cause. Once they fell into the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019 hands, they would take their own lives by biting off their tongues to deny Ji Lei of the chance to interrogate them.Exactly where was Prince Chu?Only Xiao Chiye knew!\u201cLittle bastard!\u201d Somewhat frustrated, Ji Lei rose to his feet to survey the place. \u201cGet Tuancheng Garrison Troop search along the hunting grounds!\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan climbed out of the water and dragged Xiao Chiye out. But this slope was too steep. He bit down on Xiao Chiye\u2019s back collar and hauled, finally dragging him up.The wound on Shen Zechuan\u2019s left hand bled incessantly. He tore his clothes, rinsed it in the water, and wrapped it around the wound.Xiao Chiye leaned against the moss-covered rock and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a handkerchief in my bosom.\u201dShen Zechuan reached into the clothes on his chest and fished out a handkerchief that was a pile of mud. He squeezed out all the muddy water onto Xiao Chiye\u2019s chest.Xiao Chiye asked, \u201cWhen will the effects of this drug pass?\u201d\u201cTwo hours. Soon.\u201d\u201cCrouching in a tree is better than taking cover in the water.\u201d Xiao Chiye looked at him and saw that he was soaked to the skin. His back collar was slightly open, and there were still specks of mud on his neck. The contrast between them was very\u2026\u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0have offices for domesticating beasts. Animals can smell the scent of blood.\u201d As Shen Zechuan spoke, he lowered his head and took a light sniff of the fingertip that had bled earlier.Very seductive.Xiao Chiye watched him.What sorcery was this? This man was still wielding a blade to kill earlier, and he wasn\u2019t acting like a woman, so why had he thought of such a term?He must have really been possessed by Li Jianheng! Harp, harp, harp. The latter had kept harping on and on about this every day that even he himself had come to think and see it this way, just like those old men in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0with their special fetishes.\u201cYour swordsmanship is pretty good.\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s gaze looked as though they could peel off Shen Zechuan\u2019s back collar. \u201cYou must have trained hard in the temple. And yet one can\u2019t tell from your body\u2019s physical appearance alone. Did you use medicine on yourself?\u201dShen Zechuan looked askance at him. Following his gaze, he raised his hand to touch the back of his neck. He asked in response, \u201cHow many times a day do you have to look at it? Are you that obsessed with it?\u201dXiao Chiye licked the residual taste of blood with the tip of his tongue and said, \u201cThe way you put it is so ambiguous. You make it sound like I\u2019m a lecherous ghost.\u201dShen Zechuan reached over and covered Xiao Chiye\u2019s face with the dirty handkerchief and said, \u201cI thought you only fool around with women and courtesans. I never expect you to have a taste for both men and women.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cWhat\u2019s this flirting? This Second Young Master just wants you to wipe the mud off your neck.\u201d\u201cDo you want me to wipe it?\u201d With the handkerchief serving as a partition, Shen Zechuan\u2019s fingertip stopped between Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyebrows. \u201cOr do you want to wipe it for me?\u201dIcy cold rainwater trickled down along his fingers and dripped between Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyebrows. As if they had fully absorbed that alluring temptation, the droplets that dripped all blossomed into ripples of water that flowed tide after tide into his collar, stirring up in him a wet, ticklish restlessness.Xiao Chiye wanted very much to drink some water. At the same time, he wanted Shen Zechuan to stay a little farther away from him.After a moment of silence, he smiled and said, \u201cYou sure are something.\u201d\u201cYou think too much.\u201d Shen Zechuan tightened his collar around him, held his blade, and spoke no further.The rain gradually abated.The barking of hounds in the woods rang out from afar. Neither man moved. This rock was propped against the side of the stream, and it was covered with shrubs above. It was an exceptionally small and narrow hiding-place, large enough for just one man.Xiao Chiye waited for quite a while, listening as the man leading the hound closed in on them. Shen Zechuan wedged\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0in midair and crouched over to climb his way in from below.Xiao Chiye felt a weight on his body as that man edged along his legs to his chest. Both men squeezed, body to body, into this narrow space. Xiao Chiye could feel the heat of their thighs rubbing against each other when the other man straddled him. He could also feel the latter\u2019s breathing as he leaned in close beside his temple.Xiao Chiye covered his eyes. In the darkness, he could freely visualize Shen Zechuan\u2019s posture. He could not shake off the image of that white-as-lotus-root neck either.\u201cI beg of you.\u201d Xiao Chiye sighed. \u201cSit on my stomach. Don\u2019t sit farther down.\u201dShen Zechuan did not move, because the rustling sound above came closer.Xiao Chiye adjusted his breathing. But if he raised his head up in this posture, he could touch Shen Zechuan\u2019s chin. Move down a little, and the tip of his nose could nuzzle along the contour of that neck.Shen Zechuan was originally listening attentively to the movements when he suddenly lifted Xiao Chiye\u2019s handkerchief to look at him without saying a word.Xiao Chiye was also looking at Shen Zechuan. He did not know if the scent of blood tonight had gone to his head, or whatever it was that was going on. In any case, that gradually hardening part of his was pressing up against the man above. It made both men uncomfortable. Fabrics that had been soaked through by rainwater clung so closely to their skins that it was akin to physical contact between bare skins. It was as if he shifted just a little more, he would be intentionally creating friction to ignite a fire.The hound above was still sniffing around.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 : DaybreakHuman feet trampled over the shrubbery. As though it had smelled something, the hound nudged aside the branches and leaves with its snout and pawed at the ground.Shen Zechuan was doused with dirt all over his neck. Moving up or down were both out of the question, so he could only remain frozen in position.Xiao Chiye felt even more uncomfortable. This posture made it hard for him to loosen up. Every single moment, he was in constant contact with firm, delicate skin. The man riding on his body was not a person at all, but a mass of clouds enveloping him like wet mist\u2014ubiquitous, and all-pervasive.This atmosphere whipped him up. The place he had not relieved for a long time remained in high spirits. It was so hard he just wanted to take a cold shower right at once.Raindrops splashed his hair wet.In this endless stalemate, Xiao Chiye finally regained some of his strength. His fingers twitched as the sense of numbness slowly receded.The man above their heads finally moved away, but Shen Zechuan\u2019s tensed body did not relax. Pressing up against each other in a corner of this danger zone turned it into another precarious situation concerning their safety in another way.Keeping his cool, Xiao Chiye did not shift his eyes away.He could not look away. He only had to show just a fraction of evasiveness and it would look like he really had a thing for Shen Zechuan.\u201cYou are pressing me too tightly.\u201d Xiao Chiye said nonchalantly.Shen Zechuan did not reply.For the first time, Xiao Chiye knew how to read the words \u201che who rides a tiger finds it difficult to dismount\u201d.1\u00a0He wanted to raise his head and gasp for air, but he did not do so, because doing so would look like he was a rascal who was too impatient to even wait.He swore that he did not have that intention.It was just that they were too close to each other. He was instinctively bewitched by this minute touch and distinctive scent, and his body consequently submitted to the impulses of his bestial desires.Xiao Chiye felt Shen Zechuan sliding down along his chest. The very instant Shen Zechuan separated from him, he breathed out a light sigh of relief as if he had been relieved of a huge burden.But before he was done heaving his sigh of relief, his collar tightened around him. His person rose, scraping against the moss before he was hurled into the stream without warning.Before Xiao Chiye landed in the water, he backhandedly grasped hold of Shen Zechuan\u2019s wrists. Then he lifted his leg to hook and trip\u00a0 Shen Zechuan. Just as Shen Zechuan fell into the stream too, Xiao Chiye rolled over, lifted Shen Zechuan\u2019s wrists, and heavily pinned him under his body.\u201cWe have already done the amorous stuff.\u201d An uncompromising Xiao Chiye refused to let Shen Zechuan move. \u201cIsn\u2019t it too unrighteous to raise your hand at me now?\u201dThe ten fingers on both of Shen Zechuan\u2019s clasped hands were slightly parted, and his hair scattered in the water. He could only gasp for breath with his chin slightly raised. Pulling at the corners of his lips slightly, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a good choice to force yourself upon others.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have that intention.\u201d Xiao Chiye itched so much to crush every word into pieces with his teeth.Shen Zechuan pressed his knee against him and looked at him with a meaningful gaze.With a hint of forbearance in Xiao Chiye\u2019s expression, he hung his head down and shook his dripping wet hair. The water droplets spattered over Shen Zechuan\u2019s face. Without waiting for Shen Zechuan to react, he had already reached out his hand to rub the back of Shen Zechuan\u2019s neck ruthlessly and stubbornly until that bit of mud that was always on his mind was all but rubbed away. Then, he fastened Shen Zechuan\u2019s collar tightly and securely around him..\u201cRainy nights are wet and cold.\u201d Xiao Chiye loosened his grip on Shen Zechuan and stepped down from his body. \u201cTake care of your body!\u201dWith that, he dunked his head into the water without giving Shen Zechuan a chance to reply. Water droplets slid down and dripped when he raised his head up again, and he had already more or less calmed down.Splashing a handful of water, Xiao Chiye grasped his blade up with penetrating eyes and said, \u201cIt\u2019s almost dawn. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Ji Lei noticed that the day was about to break, yet they still had yet to find the man. He could not help but increasingly fret.Qiao Tianya peeled away the collar of the dead soldier, but he did not find any traces.\u201cThis batch of men are Xiao the Second\u2019s men.\u201d Qiao Tianya squatted down and pondered it. \u201cEvery move of his in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0cannot escape our eyes. When did he come to raise these kinds of formidable soldiers who have no fear of death?\u201d\u201cFinding him now is the top priority!\u201d Ji Lei looked toward the northwest of\u00a0Qudu. \u201cThe Eight Great Training Divisions should have already taken control of all the main city gates of\u00a0Qudu. We mustn\u2019t lose our heads.\u201dLooking at Ji Lei\u2019s hand that had never once left his blade, Qiao Tianya felt that his restlessness was definitely not just because Xiao the Second and Prince Chu had yet to be found. It seemed as though there was another reason.\u201cXiao the Second is the life-saving token.\u201d2\u00a0Qiao Tianya maintained his composure and watched Ji Lei. \u201cYet there are other assassins thrown into the mix tonight. Does Your Excellency have any idea?\u201d\u201cThe number of people the Xiao Clan has offended isn\u2019t small. Someone wants to fish in troubled waters.\u201d Ji Lei suddenly stared at Qiao Tianya. \u201cHow would I know who it is?\u201dQiao Tianya spontaneously spread his hands out and said, \u201cWe can\u2019t find Xiao the Second at present. Your Excellency, he must have come prepared, that\u2019s why he has slipped from our fingers the entire night. It\u2019s almost dawn now, and he has played us into running around in circles. It seems more like we have fallen into his trap.\u201d\u201cFallen into his trap?\u201d Ji Lei furrowed his brows.\u201cI\u2019m afraid the reason he put himself in danger is to delay time.\u201d Qiao Tianya stood up and looked out into the grassland in the distance. \u201cMy guess is that he has reinforcements.\u201d\u201cThe troops on all four sides have not moved. So where is his reinforcement from?\u201dQiao Tianya did not answer, because he did not know either.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xi Gu\u2019an rode his horse back to the capital and found it silent all around when he entered the city gates. With his doubts roused, he drew his blade while on horseback and asked his deputy general, \u201cAre there any anomalies in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0tonight?\u201dThe deputy general came over to lead the horse. Seeing his nervous expression, he replied, \u201cNo, it\u2019s all as usual.\u201dXi Gu\u2019an said, \u201cGather the men. Except for those on strict guard duty at the various city gates, all the rest will follow me to encircle and defend the palace!\u201dWith that, he spurred his horse on towards the palace. His wife and son were still in the palace. As long as the night was not over, the Empress Dowager would definitely not let him see his wife and son. So even if he had to risk his own life, he had to ensure the Empress Dowager\u2019s safety.The deputy general went to deploy his men, but as he led the patrol squad, he came across a group of drunken men from the\u00a0Imperial Army.The Eight Great Training Divisions had always looked down upon the\u00a0Imperial Army. Without getting off his horse, he brandished the whip and cursed, \u201cScram!\u201dThe vice commander of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0was a man with a blade scar on his face. After getting lashed, he unexpectedly grinned and rolled at the hooves of the horse. He shouted, \u201cWe are both a part of the garrison guard system.3\u00a0My rank is a little higher than yours. Why did you hit me? How dare you hit me!\u201dThe deputy general sneered, \u201cLowlife pests of the government coffers.4\u00a0Scram! Don\u2019t hold up the Eight Great Training Divisions from important business!\u201dThe man swiftly turned and rose to his feet in a single move and smiled malevolently at the deputy general. He said, \u201cImportant business? The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0is the important business you will get a taste of tonight!\u201dHe had only just said that when the\u00a0Imperial Army, whom had been in various stages of drunkenness, drew their swords in unison. The deputy general reined in his horse in shock. The rows of men behind him already had their throats slit.The deputy general snapped, \u201cIs this a rebellion?!\u00a0The Eight Great Training\u2026\u201dThe glint from a blade flashed before him, and he instantly fell off the back of his horse. His blood spilled over the ground.The man kicked the deputy general\u2019s head aside and wiped his blade clean on the deputy general\u2019s chest. He said in a steady voice, \u201cKeep daydreaming. The political situation has changed. It\u2019s time for my\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0to piss on your heads from the top!\u201dFaint white lines appeared on the horizon. Sunrise was fast approaching.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Qiao Tianya hurriedly drank some water and tossed the water bag5\u00a0in passing to the man behind him. He wiped his mouth and said, \u201cKeep searching.\u201dBut then, after he took a few steps, something clicked in his mind. He suddenly turned his head and carefully sized up the subordinates behind him.Where was Prince Chu hiding?There was no way he could have escaped out of here, so why had they been unable to find him? Because they had been pursuing \u201cPrince Chu\u201d all night, but it was possible that Prince Chu had already become an Imperial Bodyguard!Qiao Tianya instantly gave his order. \u201cInspect the waist tokens!6\u00a0Everyone on the duty record tonight must be verified face to face. Check now!\u201dThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0removed their waist tokens and presented them without exception to the Judge to authenticate against their faces. The Judge7\u00a0checked each token and swept a glance across each man it belonged to. He conducted his check with his photographic memory until the very end of the line.\u201cWaist token.\u201d The Judge raised his eyes and stared at the other party like an eagle. \u201cHand your waist token over.\u201dThe other party pushed his waist token onto the tray, and the Imperial Bodyguard leaning closely next to him suddenly began to tremble. The latter hung his head down, not daring to raise it.The Judge did not seem to notice. Using his brush, he drew a tick in the book and said, \u201cWhich bureau?\u201dChen Yang replied, \u201cOffice of Ceremonial Swords.\u201d8\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you during a mission.\u201d The Judge said, \u201cFirst time?\u201dLi Jianheng trembled so much that Chen Yang knew they could not escape this. He remained unruffled and said, \u201cStrangers at the first meeting, friends at the second. You will find me familiar enough after seeing me a few more times.\u201dThe Judge pointed at Li Jianheng with the brush and said, \u201cWaist token .\u201dLi Jianheng did not manage to pull it off even after a few attempts. The Judge smiled and reached a hand out as if to remove the token for him.The moment the Judge extended his hand, Chen Yang\u2019s body tensed. Who would have expected Li Jianheng to have already lost heart? As the Judge moved, Li Jianheng flinched back holding his head and cried out involuntarily, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt me!\u201d\u2014Oh, shit!Right at this critical moment, they suddenly heard a shrill whistle. Following right after, a horse with a white chest and black back unexpectedly galloped out of the forest. As the day broke, the gyrfalcon finally led the way back, circling in the air towards them.Hua Siqian heard the movements and saw a troop of military forces galloping across the grassland towards them in an attack. He asked in a stern tone, \u201cThe Eight Great Training Divisions?\u201dBut these men had no insignia on their armors. They did not even carry banners.Knowing that the time had come, Chen Yang immediately supported Prince Chu and said in a loud voice, \u201cUnder the protection of the\u00a0Imperial Army, all those who bear swords before His Royal Highness the Crown Prince will be slain. Move back now!\u201dHua Siqian took two steps forward in disbelief. He looked back and shouted, \u201cPrince Chu is being held hostage by traitors. What are you all waiting for?!\u201dLi Jianheng had no way to retreat. Seeing the Judge pounce on him, he could not help but yell. A long blade that was suddenly tossed out from the forest stabbed into the ground right before Li Jianheng.Xiao Chiye leaped down, took off his waist token, and threw it into the tray. He said a deep voice, \u201cWith the main forces bringing up the rear, who still dares to move?\u201dJi Lei had just arrived riding his horse. On seeing this, he bellowed too, \u201cWhat a load of bullshit! Just a mere\u00a0Imperial Army\u2014\u201dThe gyrfalcon landed on Xiao Chiye\u2019s shoulder. Xiao Chiye stroked the gyrfalcon as though he was rewarding it. He said, \u201cIf Old Ji has the balls to, then try.\u201dJi Lei looked towards the grassland again. The vanguards of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0had already arrived. Yet there seemed to be no end to the long stretch of military forces behind. The Qidong Cangjun Commandery banner suddenly unfurled, and he saw that the one at the head of the galloping horses was precisely Qi Zhuyin.Hua Siqian retreated several steps. Holding on to Pan Rugui, and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cThe letter to Qidong has been intercepted. How could they so soundlessly\u2026\u201d\u201cIf all the letters in the\u00a0Qudu\u00a0have to go through the hands of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards,\u201d Xiao Chiye kept away his blade. \u201cThen how troublesome would that be?\u201dSeeing that the situation was beyond salvation, Hua Siqian sat on the ground and murmured, \u201cThe Empress Dowager is still around\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Empress Dowager is advanced in years. In order to take care of her health, she has already handed all matters pertaining to the patrol and defense of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0to take charge.\u201d Xiao Chiye had run for the entire night, and now, he pulled up Li Jianheng and said, \u201cYour Highness has been on the move all night. It has been hard on you!\u201dQi Zhuyin\u2019s horse had already arrived. She turned to dismount and kneeled to Li Jianheng to pay her obeisances. She said loudly, \u201cYour Highness, do not worry. The 200,000 military forces under Qidong\u2019s command are on full alert. This subject, Qi Zhuyin, will go all out to ensure the safety of Your Highness!\u201dAs if he was in a dream, Li Jianheng looked blankly at Qi Zhuyin, then looked to his left and right. Qiao Tianya was the most discerning and astute. Seeing that the outcome was a foregone conclusion, he immediately kneeled. As soon as he did so, the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0discarded their blades and kneeled down one after another in succession.\u201c\u2026 I\u2026\u201dLi Jianheng clenched his empty palms as though he was clutching on to some life-saving straw. He practically wept with joy. The tears in his eyes trickled down even while he was still muttering.\u201cNow that I\u2019m the Crown Prince\u20269\u00a0I\u2019ll surely heavily reward everyone\u2019s great kindness in the future!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 : FrostImperial Concubine Wei was on tenterhooks as she walked. Seeing the unfamiliar palace walls around her, she could not help but ask in fear, \u201cGonggong, why aren\u2019t we there yet? Where is the Empress Dowager?\u201dThe eunuch walking ahead ignored her.Imperial Concubine Wei\u2019s hair stood on end in this quiet and secluded place. She stopped in her tracks, then feigned a stomachache and stirred up a ruckus about wanting to head back.She had never seen this eunuch leading the way before. He looked unfamiliar and young. The eunuch turned his head back to look at her and said in a gentle voice, \u201cWe will be there soon. Support Imperial Concubine Wei as she walks. We mustn\u2019t let\u00a0Niangniang\u00a0fall.\u201dThe eunuchs on both sides immediately held on to Imperial Concubine Wei to support her. Imperial Concubine Wei started to struggle. She raised her voice to yell, but was gagged. The eunuchs nimbly hoisted her up and speedily walked on ahead.There was a well in the deserted courtyard, with some water remaining at the bottom of the well.The eunuch craned his head to look and said, \u201cRight here. Send\u00a0Niangniang\u00a0in.\u201dImperial Concubine Wei struggled with all her might, and her well-maintained fingernails scratched the arm of the leading eunuch. Her bun was disheveled as she shook her head and sobbed while clinging to the edge of the well.The eunuch stroked her pretty hand and told the men in a pitying voice to lift the stone.Then, a \u201cplop\u201d startled away the birds on the branch over the vermilion wall.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Emperor Xiande lay inside the horse carriage, while Li Jianheng kneeled by his side holding a\u00a0 medicine bowl in his hands.Emperor Xiande\u2019s breathing was so weak that he could not even cough. He beckoned to Li Jianheng. The latter quickly put aside the medicine bowl and moved over on his knees. He said, \u201cImperial Elder Brother, are you feeling better?\u201dEmperor Xiande placed his hand on the back of Li Jianheng\u2019s hand and said laboriously, \u201cJianheng.\u201d\u201cYour younger brother1\u00a0is here.\u201d Li Jianheng started crying again. He said, \u201cYour younger brother is right here.\u201d\u201cThe former emperor, in his later years, was impeded by others. At that time, the Crown Prince of the Eastern Palace was my eldest brother, while I\u2026\u201d Emperor Xiande looked at him, \u201cI was like you, an idle Prince. The ways of the world are unpredictable. In the end, this empire fell into my hands. But ever since I ascended to the throne, I have been under control. Every move I make is just like a puppet before a screen. If Imperial Mother wants me to laugh, then I have to laugh. If she wants me to die, then, I must now die.\u201dLi Jianheng choked with tears.Emperor Xiande said, \u201cIn the future, you will become that lonely man.\u201d2All at once, Li Jianheng burst into tears. He held Emperor Xiande\u2019s hand and pleaded, \u201cImperial Elder Brother! How could I be him? I\u2019m just a worm in this Li Clan\u2019s empire. How am I up to sitting at the peak? Imperial Elder Brother, I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m so scared.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d With a sudden burst of energy, Emperor Xiande held Li Jianheng\u2019s hand tightly and opened his eyes wide. \u201cYou are different from me\u2026 the Empress Dowager\u2019s kin3\u00a0have lost! There\u2019s only death left for Hua Siqian. Likewise for Pan Rugui. If you kill them, then the Empress Dowager will have no one left to aid her! From then on, power will fall back to you, and you will be\u2026 the ruler of all lands under Heaven! What I couldn\u2019t do\u2026 You can\u2026 I\u2026\u201dEmperor Xiande started coughing so violently that he trembled all over. Unwilling to release Li Jianheng, he continued with blood in his mouth.\u201cEliminate the Empress Dowager\u2019s kin and supervise the court officials. The Hua Clan has lost. And\u2026 and something else\u2026 you must bear in mind. Allow no one to sleep too soundly in the bed of imperial power!4\u00a0Those\u2026 who save you today\u2026 can kill you\u2026 tomorrow! Military power is like a fierce tiger\u2026 Xiao\u2026\u201dEmperor Xiande vomited fresh blood, throwing Li Jianheng into a panic.\u201c\u2026 Never\u2026\u201d Emperor Xiande gasped for breath and gripped Li Jianheng so hard that the latter hurt. \u201cNever ever\u2026 release\u2026 A-Ye\u2026\u201dNever ever release A-Ye back to Libei!It did not matter if he was a rich young master or an extraordinary talent. As long as he was here, the Xiao Clan was just a dog. Even though the Empress Dowager\u2019s kin have been defeated, it did not mean that the frontier would not assemble their own personal army and consolidate their power to challenge the central administration. Without the Hua Clan, who else could hold the Xiao Clan in check?! Since Xiao Chiye had the disposition to be able to endure it in silence for five whole years to transform the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0from a degenerate bunch into remarkable soldiers, then imagine if they gave him another five more years before letting him return to Libei\u2026 Would he not become a menace then?!Li Jianheng said blankly, \u201cImperial Elder Brother\u2026 How can we do that\u2026 Imperial Elder Brother\u2026\u201d\u201cStrip him of his power5\u00a0and reduce his troops.\u201d Emperor Xiande said weakly, \u201c\u2026 When necessary\u2026 kill\u2026 kill\u2026\u201dKill him.Li Jianheng saw him close his eyes and instantly wailed. Even before his death, Emperor Xiande never released his hand. The resentment and gloom in his expression never once dissipated.He ascended to the throne for nine years, and he had never made a decision even once before the Empress Dowager. It was the Empress Dowager who had the final say over his meals, clothing, expenses, and even the choice of woman to spend the night in his chamber.6\u00a0The craziest move he had ever made in this life was to communicate secretly with Qidong and draw Xi Gu\u2019an over to his side to pave, at the hunting grounds, what seemed like a smooth way to the throne for Li Jianheng.The long procession on their way back stopped, and tremendous cries of grief and sorrow rang out. Dense mass of ministers kneeled. Hai Liangyi took the lead in shedding tears and choking with sobs. He cried out, \u201cYour Majesty\u201d, and this, was the last of Emperor Xiande\u2019s honor.The funeral bell in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0tolled for a very long time, and the entire country wept bitter tears.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Empress Dowager Hua sat on the couch and fed Emperor Xiande\u2019s parrot.Listening to the sound of the bell, the parrot shouted, \u201cJianyun! Jianyun! Jianyun is back!\u201dThe eastern pearls7\u00a0 beside Empress Dowager Hua\u2019s ears swayed slightly as she nodded and said, \u201cJianyun is back.\u201dThe parrot then shouted, \u201cImperial Mother! Imperial Mother!\u201dEmpress Dowager Hua remained motionless as she tapped her wooden spoon. The white hair in the slanting shadow could no longer be covered up, and the fine wrinkles at the corners of her eyes looked like the cracks on valuable porcelain.The parrot shouted a few more times before it suddenly fell headlong into the cage and went permanently still.Empress Dowager Hua set aside the wooden spoon and sat quietly until the sound of the bell stopped. Only then she said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Imperial Concubine Wei? Why is she taking so long to come?\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Because of Emperor Xiande, Xiao Chiye was so busy after returning to the capital that he could hardly get a breather. For several days, he kneeled together with the other officials. By the time he could really get to lie down, he was already exhausted.But even though he was dead beat, he still had to bathe. As Xiao Chiye wiped his body, he saw that the scrapes and grazes on his shoulders had already scabbed over. He put on a new robe and came out to ask Chen Yang, \u201cWhere is that man?\u201dThis time, Chen Yang knew who he meant. He replied, \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are being reorganized, so he has to re-enlist these few days. He didn\u2019t even go home much.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking\u2026\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cWhere is Ji Lei? Who are you talking about?\u201dChen Yang scratched his head a little abashedly and said, \u201cOh, Ji Lei. He\u2019s been detained. He should be executed by beheading after the new Emperor ascends to the throne. Viceroy, weren\u2019t you the one who locked that man up?\u201dXiao Chiye put on his outer garment and said in all seriousness, \u201cI forgot.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan, Ge Qingqing and Xiaowu were eating their noodles at the noodle stall. When they were halfway through the meal, Xiaowu suddenly stared fixedly ahead.Shen Zechuan turned his head back and saw Xiao Chiye tossing some silver to the proprietor. He then lifted his robe to sit beside him and said, \u201cTwo bowls of noodles.\u201dXiaowu slurped his noodles down. Holding the bowl, he shuffled on his butt away to another table like a timid quail. Under Xiao Chiye\u2019s gaze, Ge Qingqing took his bowl and moved away too.Shen Zechuan picked at his noodles and said, \u201cI\u2019m full.\u201d\u201cFinish it.\u201d Xiao Chiye pulled out a pair of chopsticks and clamped them at Shen Zechuan, \u201cAfraid to see me? Look at how anxious you are to flee.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Shen Zechuan slowly took the last bite. \u201cAnyone who gets\u2026 pinned down once should be afraid.\u201d\u201cYou made your escape pretty fast that other day we were protecting the Emperor.\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s noodles came, and he poured vinegar into it. \u201cIt was such a good opportunity for you to get a promotion. Why did you run?\u201d\u201cI did nothing of the sort.\u201d Shen Zechuan blew at the soup and drank it. \u201cSo why join in the fun?\u201dXiao Chiye started eating his noodles. When he was almost finished, he suddenly piped up, \u201cCome to think of it, you squatted behind me that night for a long time, didn\u2019t you? Who to choose? Why not play it by ear? If Xi Gu\u2019an took down\u00a0Qudu, you will give me a stab. If Xi Gu\u2019an didn\u2019t, you will give me a hand. Keeping an eye on the perfect opportunity was just to wait for me to fall that one time before you would make your move.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019re lucky.\u201d Shen Zechuan inclined his head and smiled, \u201cYou\u2019re still alive.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t be the one who shot that arrow at me, could you? If I weren\u2019t in a perilous situation, then how could your favor have appeared all the more significant?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t even ask for anything in return for the great favor I did.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cWhy are you still thinking that I\u2019m plotting against you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not asking for anything in return that\u2019s the problem.\u201d Xiao Chiye did not seem to have eaten his fill. He set aside his chopsticks and said, \u201cThat day you dare not appear before Prince Chu, was it because you were afraid of Ji Lei, or because you were afraid Hua Siqian would blurt out something?\u201dShen Zechuan stacked his copper coins neatly, then leaned close to Xiao Chiye to whisper, \u201cWrong. I was afraid of you.\u201dXiao Chiye parroted, \u201cAfraid of me?\u201d\u201cThat hardness, man.\u201dThe human voices around him seemed far away. All that remained in Xiao Chiye\u2019s ears was this warm puff of \u201chard\u201d. Because of this word, he realized that Shen Zechuan was wearing a fastened collar today which half-surrounded that neck, denying him of the chance to eye it wantonly again.His expression underwent a few changes, then he looked at Shen Zechuan and squeezed out two words through clenched teeth, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cThe Second Young Master has come of age now too.\u201d Shen Zechuan sat back upright. \u201cTime to get a wife.\u201d\u201cYour Second Young Master has more tricks to play than you.\u201d Seeing that he was about to leave, Xiao Chiye grasped his wrist to forbid him from standing up. He said, \u201cYou are always wanting to leave before I\u2019m done talking. That\u2019s against the rules.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re always laying your hand on me at every turn.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cTell me again about the rules.\u201dXiao Chiye released his hand and said, \u201cI\u2019ll repay you for the friendly sentiment.\u201d\u201cCall me Master and I\u2019ll consider it repaid.\u201d Shen Zechuan said.\u201cBut you have to return me the thing.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t want me to keep chasing after you for the thumb ring, right?\u201dShen Zechuan tossed the bone thumb ring to him without demur.Xiao Chiye caught it and said suspiciously, \u201cWhat kind of conspiracy is this? To think you would return it the moment I said it.\u201d\u201cThe way honest people handle matters,\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cis just that straightforward.\u201dAt this point, there was nothing more to say.Xiao Chiye watched Shen Zechuan rise to his feet as he turned the thumb ring around with his fingertips. Somehow, he found it too easy.\u201cGoing home?\u201d He asked behind him.\u201cIt\u2019s my turn to be on duty tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0have been reshuffled. So what duty are you talking about?\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cWinter is a difficult time. Take care.\u201d\u201cSmall fry like me drift with the current and go with the flow.\u201d Shen Zechuan turned around. \u201cThe one who should take care isn\u2019t me.\u201dXiao Chiye touched his knuckles and said, \u201cAnd while you are at it, send my regards to Ji Gang-shifu.\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s leg that had already taken a step forward paused in mid-action as he swiftly stared towards him.Xiao Chiye wore his thumb ring properly and jested, \u201cLanzhou, want to go and play together?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 : Autumn ChillShen Zechuan immediately smiled and said, \u201cThis is no big secret anyway\u2026 Goodbye.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t hear me out first?\u201d Xiao Chiye was in a good mood after recovering his lost thumb ring. \u201cSince Ji Gang is your master, then we are fellow disciples. I\u2019m older than you, so it wouldn\u2019t put you at a disadvantage to call me\u00a0shixiong.\u201d\u201cThe Ji Clan has nothing to do with Libei.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s mind quickly recalled his fight with Xiao Chiye in the snow five years ago. Back then, he had felt a sense of familiarity that kept bugging him.\u201cNot necessarily so.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say for sure when it comes to stuff like affinity.\u201dShen Zechuan gestured to Ge Qingqing and Xiaowu and sat back down beside Xiao Chiye. He said, \u201cYou checked Ge Qingqing out.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t forget it.\u201d Xiao Chiye looked at him, \u201cFive years ago, he fled so fast. Five years later, he\u2019s close to you. How could I not get suspicious of something so glaring? So I took the opportunity to check him out and managed to dig out all about him.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Shen Zechuan asked with a smile.\u201cNothing.\u201d Xiao Chiye raised a finger to point and tap at Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to force a smile. We could be considered sworn friends in life and death. So there\u2019s no point in putting on an act of bravado. Your mind is already troubled. Afraid now, huh.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cNot quite there yet.\u201dXiao Chiye reversed his chopsticks and tapped the table intermittently. He said, \u201cSince Ji Gang is your\u00a0shifu, then it makes sense for the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0led by Ge Qingqing to spare your life back then.\u201d\u201cYou are oversuspicious.\u201d Shen Zechuan looked at the brown oil stain accumulated on the tabletop. \u201cJust because that kick didn\u2019t kill me, your suspicions were roused, and you kept probing into it. You are really dogged.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all the virtues I have.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cAnd I use them all on you.\u201d\u201cSince we are from the same school of martial arts,\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t do for you not to report your\u00a0shifu\u2019s name, right?\u201dBored stiff, Xiao Chiye tossed the chopsticks back into the bamboo holder and said, \u201cLet\u2019s hear you call me\u00a0shixiong\u00a0first.\u201dShen Zechuan said nothing.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cJi Gang could be considered a real man. I sent someone to Duanzhou to make enquiries. Everyone thought he was burned to death\u2014Was he the one who killed Xiaofuzi?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d Shen Zechuan righted the chopstick holder. \u201cMy\u00a0shifu\u00a0is already advanced in age. How could he have killed him?\u201dA slight wind rose right then. Neither man moved.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cYou looked like you have done nothing. Yet I feel as if you have done everything.\u201d\u201cWhether I did it or not, all of you will not let me go.\u201d Propping himself on his stool, Shen Zechuan turned to Xiao Chiye and smiled slowly. He said softly, \u201cThen why don\u2019t I do all the bad things so that you are justified in hating me?\u201dThe next day.It was only when Xiao Chiye entered the palace that he learned Imperial Concubine Wei was dead.Li Jianheng had already changed his attire. These days, he had cried until he looked wan and sallow. Seated in a high position, he said, \u201cThey said she slipped and fell into the well. They didn\u2019t find her body until last night.\u201dThis slip was really too coincidental.Seeing no one around, Li Jianheng asked in a whisper, \u201cCe\u2019an, don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s you\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye shook his head.Li Jianheng seemed relieved. He fidgeted in his seat and said, \u201cNow that I live in the palace, I can see the eunuchs the moment I open my eyes at night. It\u2019s rather scary. They used to call Pan Rugui\u00a0Lao Zuzong,1\u00a0and now this\u00a0Lao Zuzong\u00a0is still locked up in prison! Ce\u2019an, do you think they will hate me\u2026\u201dHe let loose a stream of grumbles, and they were all about how afraid he was. In the end, he got Xiao Chiye to transfer the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0over first to take over the key duty of the palace patrol.Xiao Chiye naturally would not refuse. He stayed for a moment and listened as Li Jianheng said, \u201cLibei has sent a message saying that the Prince of Libei and your eldest brother are on the way here. Ce\u2019an, you\u2019ll be able to see them in a few more days.\u201dLi Jianheng was somewhat playing up to him. To think he had to be even more timid than he was in the past, right before he was about to become the master of the lands under heaven. That insufferable arrogance of his seemed to have been worn away during the Autumn Hunt. He had already understood who was in power.Xiao Chiye did not intend to accept the reward bestowed upon him. His wish was something Li Jianheng could not be any more clearer about. But to date, Li Jianheng had said nothing about letting him back to Libei.Xiao Chiye\u2019s expression remained impassive, but his heart sank.Five days later, the Prince of Libei entered\u00a0Qudu.That day, the autumn rain continued uninterrupted. Xiao Chiye rode his horse out of the city early in the morning and stood in the pavilion where he had seen them off back then. After waiting for four hours, he finally saw several flying eagles materializing out of the sky.The \u201cMeng\u201d on his shoulder instantly grew excited and charged into the rain to hover and catch up with its brothers and sisters.The Armored Cavalry galloped over in the rain, looking much like a stroke of thick ink in the water sweeping towards Xiao Chiye. Without waiting for the Armored Cavalry to come nearer, he flipped out of the pavilion and dashed up in the rain to greet them.\u201cFather!\u201dSitting on his horse, Xiao Jiming laughed aloud and said to his father before him, \u201cHe looks so tall and strong now. But the moment he sees Father, he shows his real self.\u201dXiao Fangxu took off his bamboo hat and leaned over to rap on Xiao Chiye\u2019s head. He scrutinized him for a moment and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve grown taller.\u201dXiao Chiye grinned and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u00a0dage\u00a0is almost going to be half a head shorter than me!\u201d\u201cWhat a smug lad.\u201d Xiao Jiming said, \u201cEver since he outgrew me, he has to mention it every year we meet.\u201dXiao Fangxu let Zhao Hui lead his horse away as he dismounted and raised his arms to give his youngest son a sudden hug. Patting him heavily on the back, he said, \u201cSilly lad!\u201dThe pats made Xiao Chiye smile. He said, \u201cI have been waiting for a long time. Did something happen on the way?\u201dZhao Hui said, \u201cThe little Young Master caught a chill at home. So the Prince made a detour to Dengzhou to invite the Venerable2\u00a0Yigui back home for a look.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cAh Xun is sick? When did it happen? Why didn\u2019t\u00a0dage\u00a0mention it in the letter?!\u201dXiao Jiming said, \u201cIt\u2019s just something minor. There\u2019s Yizhi at home to look after him. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dXiao Chiye felt a little disappointed.Five years ago when he left Libei, his eldest sister-in-law had been pregnant. Now, little Ah Xun was four years old, and he had not even seen him yet. He could only learn of some interesting tidbits of his little nephew from his father\u2019s and brother\u2019s letters.He wanted to go home.Xiao Chiye\u2019s disappointment was fleeting. He smiled and said, \u201cI have already prepared a birthday present. When\u00a0dage\u00a0returns home this time, please bring it back on my behalf.\u201dXiao Fangxu dusted off the brim of his bamboo hat and said, \u201cBefore we set off, Xun-er specially painted a picture for you. I\u2019ll get Zhao Hui to bring it to you later. This is not the place to chat. I\u2019ll head for the palace first. It\u2019s not too late for us father and son to talk when I return to the residence at night.\u201dThe party of men mounted their horses and rode their way into\u00a0Qudu.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8It had already been many years since the Prince of Libei had shown himself in public. Now that the name of the Four Generals had spread far and wide, very few people would still remember the Prince of Libei, Xiao Fangxu.As Autumn came, Grand Mentor Qi ate so well that he put on weight. At present, he was washing his feet in the rain, wiggling and rubbing his toes against each other. He said, \u201cSpeaking of the Four Generals of the world, they actually existed twenty years ago. Back then, Xiao Fangxu of Libei, Qi Shiyu of Qidong, Liu Pingyan of Bianjun Commandery, and Feng Yisheng of the Suotian Pass, were the Commanders-in-chief of the military forces on all sides. Feng Yisheng later died in battle, and the Feng Clan\u2019s bloodline was severed. No one probably remembers this name today. But back then, they were all valiant warriors who stepped onto the frontier pass with their horses and wiped out the Biansha troops.\u201d\u201cFeng Yisheng?\u201d Ji Gang responded in a loud voice as he did the cooking inside. \u201cWhat do you mean no one remembers? Chuan-er! Both of General Feng\u2019s sons died on the battlefield. He later adopted a son, who is your\u00a0shifu\u2019s eldest brother.\u201dShen Zechuan scooped rice into the bowls and repeated, \u201cShifu\u2019s eldest brother?\u201dJi Gang smacked his own head and said, \u201cI forgot to tell you!\u201dGrand Mentor Qi yelled, \u201cIs the food ready? Aye, isn\u2019t his eldest brother Zuo Qianqiu?! What\u2019s there to tell? Anyone could guess!\u201dShen Zechuan served the dishes, laid out chopsticks for Grand Mentor Qi, and said respectfully, \u201cTeacher, please have your meal.\u201dGrand Mentor Qi gulped down a mouthful of wine and said, \u201cHaving someone wait on you is still the most comfortable feeling ever.\u201dJi Gang wiped away his sweat and sat on the other side of the table and said, \u201cYou said earlier that Xiao the Second told you he\u2019s from the same school of martial arts with us. Then, I\u2019m afraid his\u00a0shifu\u00a0is Zuo Qianqiu!\u201dShen Zechuan took two mouthfuls of rice.Ji Gang lamented, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him in years. Did you exchange blows with Xiao the Second this time? How was it? Were the strokes of his blade strong and forceful?\u201dGrand Mentor Qi said, \u201cLet Lanzhou eat first. We\u2019ll talk again when we have eaten our fill. It\u2019s dangerous this time, and there\u2019s no hurry. We can rest for a few days.\u201d\u201cI should have thought of it.\u201d Ji Gang said, \u201cXiao the Second wore a bone thumb ring. The one in this world who knows best how to wield a powerful bow is Zuo Qianqiu.\u201d\u201cPerhaps you will be able to meet your eldest brother now that Xiao Fangxu has entered\u00a0Qudu.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi picked out the dishes. \u201cZuo Qianqiu fought to the death at Tianfei Watchtower. Although he warded off the Biansha cavalry, his wife died. It was because of that battle that he obtained the name of \u2018Thunder Sinking the Jade Stage\u2019, but it was also because of it that he never recovered from the setback. Rumor has it that he has left home to become a monk, but it\u2019s also possible that he has been living incognito to teach Xiao Fangxu\u2019s son after receiving refuge from the latter.\u201dJi Gang said with sorrow, \u201cA general\u2019s success is built upon the sacrifices of tens of thousands of people. So what if he\u2019s renowned for his impressive military exploits? In the end, he\u2019ll still turn into a handful of loess. Those who died on the battlefield are loyal to the end, while those who survived aren\u2019t having a wonderful time either. Zuo Qianqiu lives incognito, Xiao Fangxu is ill, and Lu Pingyan is old. Twenty more years later, where would the current Four Generals be at? It\u2019s all but the slapping of waves on sand, with one generation after generation superseding the former.\u201dGrand Mentor Qi was slightly tipsy as he watched Shen Zechuan eat his meal. After a long while, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s too much of a loss to suffer through an entire lifetime for nothing. All of us will eventually die. So why not reach for the sky and fulfill your aspirations before you die?! Lanzhou, here! Have another bowl!\u201dBy the time they had eaten and drank to their heart\u2019s content, the sky was already dark.Grand Mentor Qi lay across the mat while Shen Zechuan sat under the eaves to wipe his teacher\u2019s feet. Ji Gang took out two outer garments and draped it over both of them. Then he squatted in the corner to smoke his pipe.Resting his head on a papaya, Grand Mentor Qi said, \u201cLanzhou, tell me the situation at the hunting ground again.\u201dShen Zechuan gave a detailed account of it again.Grand Mentor Qi listened with his eyes closed. When Shen Zechuan was done speaking, he remained silent.The vines in the courtyard soaked in rain, with each drop pitter-pattering on the leaves. After the rain drummed on the leaves for an unspecified amount of time, Grand Mentor Qi said, \u201cXiao the Second seemed to be in the limelight this battle, but he is trapped in the same situation as his father and elder brother. The new Emperor has called him his brother for as long as five years, but he has lain low and concealed himself so deeply, so how could the former not be afraid? Today, the new Emperor can let it slide on account of him saving his life, but how long can this friendship withstand until it\u2019s all worn away into nothing? I thought he could still tolerate it for a little longer given his endurance. There are countless ways he could have let Qi Zhuyin take the limelight, but he just had to do it on his own.\u201dJi Gang knocked off the ash under the dim light and said, \u201cThe wolf cub wants to go home too. All he dreams of are the grassland of Libei. How old is he? Having this bit of spirit is what being young is about.\u201d\u201cA little lack of forbearance upsets great plans.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi said. \u201cIf he had endured it this one time, then wouldn\u2019t he have been able to return home as a dandy young master?\u201dRight at this time, Xiao Chiye was standing outside the palace gates looking up at the\u00a0 shadowy palace. The overhanging eaves of these vermillion walls seemed to be a trial Heaven had given him. Under this frivolous appearance of his, a ferocious beast howled in silence.Shen Zechuan sat upright. It was at this moment that he oddly understood the meaning behind this move of Xiao Chiye.He wanted to go home.He wanted to go home, openly and above-board, as his own person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 : Drunk In The AlleyThe Autumn rain in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0never stopped falling after the new Emperor ascended to the throne. White lanterns hung high beneath old, black tiles. If one were to stand atop the city wall overlooking the place, they would see a bleak chill shrouding every single spot.Because of the Autumn Hunt incident, all the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0had their waist tokens1\u00a0revoked.\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0of fifth grade2\u00a0and above, such as Ji Lei and Qiao Tianya, were all imprisoned. Together with Hua Siqian and Pan Rugui, they were handed over to be tried in a joint trial by the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices.3Xue Xiuzhuo was transferred from the Office of Scrutiny for Revenue and promoted to the position of Assistant Minister in the Court of Judicial Review. This position did not seem to have as much authority and power as the Chief Supervising Secretary of the Office of Scrutiny for Revenue, but in truth, it gave him an in to the central administration of\u00a0Three Judicial Offices. In other words, he not only had the authority to examine any case reviews, but also had the power to participate in the deliberations and rebuttals of proposals from the Ministry of Justice and the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau.\u201cXue Xiuzhuo.\u201dEmpress Dowager Hua reclined against the\u00a0xumi\u00a0couch4\u00a0and idly tapped the jet-black jade chess piece5\u00a0against the board.\u201cI have never heard of this child before the Nanlin Hunting Grounds incident. Who is he to the Xue Clan?\u201dMatron Liuxiang gently fanned the incense censer and said, \u201cTo reply Your Majesty, he is the third son of common birth of the Xue Clan. This slave has never heard of this person before, and so this slave specifically went to make some inquiries about him.\u201d\u201cThe Xue Clan has no lack of successors.\u201d Empress Dowager Hua said. \u201cAll these years, Yao Wenyu is the one in the limelight. I thought that old fox, Hai Liangyi, would sooner or later recommend Yao Wenyu into the Grand Secretariat after having imparted all his knowledge to him. Who would have expected him to remain silent on it and use the unremarkable Xue Xiuzhuo instead?\u201dAunt Lixiang said, \u201cXue Xiuzhuo first joined forces with the Provincial Administration Commissioner of Juexi, Jiang Qingshan, to gather evidence on the sly, then joined up with Secretariat Elder Hai to act as a go-between. He had access to the Six Ministries when he held office as the Chief Supervising Secretary of the Office of Scrutiny for Revenue. Now he has been promoted to Assistant Minister of the Court of Judicial Review, he will be hearing the case of our Secretariat Elder. I fear that he has made up his mind to get to the bottom of the matter and will not let it go at that.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t go out now.\u201d Empress Dowager Hua looked contemplative. \u201cIf Xue Xiuzhuo wants to investigate, then let him investigate. The Hua Clan is already at such a critical juncture. Go and tell Eldest Brother that he needs to have the determination to act decisively and cut his loss. Only then will we be able to stage a comeback.\u201dMatron Liuxiang uttered an acknowledgement and quietly withdrew.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan shook the rainwater off his umbrella and sat in the run-down veranda of the deserted courtyard. Less than an hour later, Xi Hongxuan\u2019s mountain-like figure strode through the moon gate6\u00a0and walked over to him while holding up an umbrella.\u201cThis is the time when spies abound all around. I almost couldn\u2019t get away.\u201d Xi Hongxuan gathered up his clothes and frowned as he asked. \u201cIs there some urgent matter for you to call me here at this time?\u201d\u201cXi Gu\u2019an is in prison.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cYour long-time wish is right before you. Yet you aren\u2019t pressing home the attack now following the victory. Are you waiting for him to take desperate action instead?\u201d\u201cHis guilt of committing a capital offense is already but certain.\u201d Xi Hongxuan said. \u201cMaking any more moves now would be like drawing legs on a snake\u2014redundant.\u201d\u201cNothing in this world is \u2018certain\u2019.\u201d There was no trace of a smile on Shen Zechuan\u2019s fair face. He said, \u201cThe more critical the situation is, the more you cannot afford to be negligent. As long as he remains alive in this dangerous situation, there\u2019s a chance he will survive through it.\u201dXi Hongxuan looked at his side profile and said, \u201cThe Hua faction case has already been handed over to the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices. With so many pairs of eyes staring, how are you planning to make your move?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not making any moves.\u201d Shen Zechuan turned his eyes. \u201cAs the Hua Clan\u2019s lackey, his crimes during his term of office are too numerous to record. As long as one or two document proofs is handed over to the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices, then his death will be all but certain.\u201d\u201cBearing a weapon before the Emperor and trapping the Crown Prince in to hunt him down. These two matters aren\u2019t enough to put him to death?\u201d\u201cAs the Commander-in-chief of the Eight Great Training Divisions, he has the prerogative to bear a blade before the Emperor. The hunt of the Crown Prince has nothing to do with him. He could simply assert that he headed back to the capital to seek and deploy reinforcements on seeing the situation go wrong. The new Emperor now fears the\u00a0Imperial Army. Although he has taken down the Hua Clan, it is at the time where he needs the help and cooperation of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans. It takes time for the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices\u00a0to review the case. The longer this drags on, the harder it will be for Xi Gu\u2019an to die.\u201d Shen Zechuan sneered a little. \u201cAs long as Xi Gu\u2019an doesn\u2019t die, you will remain Xi the Second, never to step into the limelight.\u201dAfter a lengthy silence, Xi Hongxuan said, \u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d\u201cXi Gu\u2019an has been assigned special duty in the Eight Great Training Divisions since the fourth year of Xiande.7\u00a0In the four years so far, the Eight Great Training Divisions have received a total of 9 million taels of military funds and provisions. Only 7 million of the disbursement were accounted for. Where did the remaining 2 million taels go? They all disappeared after they passed through Xi Gu\u2019an\u2019s hands.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cThe audits of the account books are originally handled by Xue Xiuzhuo. In all likelihood, he will still be able to dig out more void expenses once he checks. Pan Rugui and Hua Siqian can take such a large sum, because if they do, they are just greedy and corrupt. But Xi Gu\u2019an can\u2019t. He cannot afford to be greedy or corrupt. Control of the Eight Great Training Divisions, whose key task is to patrol and defend\u00a0Qudu, lies in his hands. If he can\u2019t explain the whereabouts of all that money, then one could only suspect if he has been embezzling money to bribe the soldiers and to raise his own private army under the name of the Eight Great Training Divisions.\u201dA chill suddenly ran down Xi Hongxuan\u2019s back. He said, \u201c\u2026 Raise his own private army.\u201d\u201cHe stands beside the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u2019s8\u00a0couch. What other reason can there be for him to raise his own private army?\u201d Shen Zechuan said.\u201c\u2026 No way!\u201d Xi Hongxuan vetoed it. He raised his hand to wipe away his sweat and said, \u201cYou think I\u2019m out of my mind? If it\u2019s just associating with the Hua Clan, then he\u2019s the only one who dies. But if it\u2019s harboring the intent to rebel, then my whole family will die! It\u2019s a crime punishable by extermination of the entire clan!\u201dShen Zechuan laughed aloud and lowered his voice. \u201cA change of sovereign brings a change of ministers.9\u00a0It\u2019s a wonderful opportunity for you to distinguish yourself now that a new Emperor has ascended to the throne. This is just Xi Gu\u2019an giving you his life as a congratulatory gift for your promotion.\u201d\u201cYou want me to\u2026\u201d Xi Hongxuan stared at Shen Zechuan for a while and suddenly burst out laughing. He said, \u201cYou are really vicious. At the very least, the Empress Dowager has saved you twice. You really show no regard for the kindness shown to you.\u201d\u201cKindness, huh?\u201d Shen Zechuan picked up the umbrella. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to repay it after killing them. What\u2019s more, the power struggle today is all a game of chess between Xiao and Hua. What does it have to do with me?\u201dWith that, he opened his umbrella, nodded slightly at Xi Hongxuan, then stepped into the night rain. Xi Hongxuan sat alone in the veranda. After Shen Zechuan disappeared, he touched his own back, finding it all drenched in cold sweat.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8A few days later, the Court of Judicial Review re-processed the Autumn Hunt case.Jiang Xie, the Chief Minister of the Court of Judicial Review, served as the presiding judge, while Hai Liangyi served as the supervisor, and Xue Xiuzhuo, the jury. This was a major case examined and prosecuted by the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau, with the criminal charges of \u201cunconstitutional formation of an insurgent faction\u201d, \u201cembezzlement of taxes to corrupt governance\u201d, and \u201cendangerment of the state\u201d submitted to the Court of Judicial Review.Of these, \u201cunconstitutional formation of an insurgent faction\u201d made the Six Ministries jittery. Those who have been to the Hua Residence, or have received recommendations from Hua Siqian and Pan Rugui in the past all found themselves in a precarious position. Countless officials submitted memorials to impeach and report Hua Siqian and Pan Rugui these few days, with each one making an impassioned statement of loyalty for fear of getting implicated.Seeing those memorials10\u00a0gave Li Jianheng a headache. He was not a person who could sit still to begin with. Even so, he did not dare to fool around during a time where the entire nation was in national mourning. He had seen the way Hai Liangyi confronted Hua Siqian that night; thus, he was very much afraid of Hai Liangyi.Hai Liangyi was rigid and inflexible. His appropriately trimmed beard was always hanging before the second clasp on the front of his robe, while his crown was properly worn, and his hair, meticulously combed. He never left his clothes open during the three hottest periods of summer,11\u00a0and he never folded his arms during the severe winter months. He was like the pine tree on the mountain ridge when he stood, and the swift wind in the quiet valley when he walked. When it came to handling matters, he was never sloppy. He could even listen attentively to the details of the case for three days and three nights without showing any traces of weariness.Li Jianheng was used to fooling around. So he always went weak in the knees on seeing this kind of elder, scholar teacher-like12\u00a0minister.Because of the Hua faction case, Hai Liangyi\u00a0 was constantly looking for him to report the details. Li Jianheng found the Dragon Throne13\u00a0in Mingli Hall so hard that his butt was always hurting from sitting too long, so he got his men to pad it up with several layers of cotton-padded mattress. But Hai Liangyi saw it and remonstrated with him, advising him to be steadfast in his conduct.The thrill of having power and authority in his grasp seemed fleeting. What followed right after was an avalanche of heavy responsibilities. The never-ending\u00a0morning court\u00a0sessions14\u00a0made it difficult for Li Jianheng to persevere. He sat on the Dragon Throne, sometimes not even understanding what those people at the foot of his throne were arguing about.No money?Then, collect taxes! Kill a bunch of corrupt officials, and the money could be recovered, no? What\u2019s there to argue about?Li Jianheng did not dare to reveal his innermost thoughts. He was afraid of Hai Liangyi, and even more afraid of these civil servants and military commanders. He did not know what they were fighting about, or why the Hua faction could not be executed immediately by decapitation, let alone what the Empress Dowager\u2019s intention in sending him snacks every day was.He huddled up on the Dragon Throne, as if he were merely having a dream.\u201cIs His Majesty ill?\u201dHaving been summoned, Xiao Chiye entered the palace and met the Imperial Physician from the Imperial Academy of Medicine outside Mingli Hall.The Imperial Physician said, \u201cHe worried too much, and the Autumn chill has gotten to him. When the Viceroy enters later, please persuade His Majesty. \u201cXiao Chiye took off\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0and strode into Mingli Hall.Li Jianheng had just taken his medicine and was zoning out on the couch at the moment. On hearing that Xiao Chiye had come, he hurriedly wore his shoes like slippers and called Xiao Chiye in.\u201cCe\u2019an.\u201d Li Jianheng said. \u201cYou\u2019re just in time. The Imperial Bakery15\u00a0will send the silk-nested tiger\u2019s eye candy later. Come and try it too. We had it at the official banquet a few years ago.\u201dXiao Chiye kowtowed and said, \u201cThank you Your Majesty for the bestowment.\u201dWith his clothes draped around him, Li Jianheng went silent for a moment, then said, \u201cCe\u2019an, take a seat.\u201dXiao Chiye sat down, and those serving at the sides withdrew. Li Jianheng suddenly stood up and restlessly turned around in circles where he was. He said, \u201cCe\u2019an, why aren\u2019t they beheading Hua Siqian? What retrial is the Court of Judicial Review talking about? What else is there for them to go over? Argh!\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cThe Court of Judicial Review has to triple check the case. This is the rule to prevent miscarriages of justice. The evidence against Hua Siqian is conclusive. He will definitely be executed by decapitation before the new year.\u201d\u201cA long night is fraught with dreams.\u201d16\u00a0Li Jianheng said nervously. \u201cThe Empress Dowager doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s in a panic\u2026 You know, she keeps sending people to deliver snacks to me every day. What is she thinking of doing? Does she want to poison me to death too?\u201d\u201cThe Hua Clan now is the target of public criticism. So the Empress Dowager somehow has to put on a show of affection.\u201d Seeing Li Jianheng\u2019s flustered expression with dark circles under his eyes, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cIs Your Majesty not sleeping well at night?\u201d\u201cHow can I sleep?\u201d Li Jianheng said, \u201cThey aren\u2019t dead yet\u2026 So how would I be able to sleep? Ce\u2019an, go tell Hai Liangyi on my behalf to skip the retrial and carry out the execution on the spot.\u201dHow would that do?Xiao Chiye was the Viceroy of the\u00a0Imperial Army. He had nothing to do with the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices, so how could he interfere in the joint trial by the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices? Moreover, after what happened at the Autumn Hunt, the next person they would take down would be his own self, Xiao Chiye. The civil officials, with Hai Liangyi at the head, were unwilling to let Xiao Chiye go. Xiao Fangxu himself had gotten wind of it these few days as well.No one was willing to take a gamble when it came to this matter. It was only with Xiao Chiye in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0that Libei would prove to be diligent in all they did. The crisis in the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo was a sore point. Xiao Jiming could save\u00a0Qudu\u00a0once or twice, but could he save\u00a0Qudu\u00a0countless times without reservation? Even if he could, who would believe it?Xiao Chiye would definitely not get entangled in any disputes with the civil servants at this point in time.Li Jianheng himself knew that it would not work, so he became more and more dispirited. When the silk-nested tiger\u2019s eye candy was sent over, he took a few cursory bites of it, but could taste nothing.As soon as Xiao Chiye left, he lay on the couch, feeling that this Emperor was really boring to be.Shuanglu, who had always been following him to serve him, kneeled beside the couch and whispered, \u201cYour Majesty\u202617\u00a0How about this slave accompanies you out for a stroll?\u201dLi Jianheng replied, \u201cNot going. I\u2019m tired.\u201dShuanglu hit upon an idea and continued,\u201d \u2026 Then how about inviting Lady Mu Ru to play the pipa18\u00a0for you?\u201dLi Jianheng turned over and took another glance outside. Seeing no one, he said, \u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can. The nation is in mourning. Besides, she\u2019s still at Pan Rugui\u2019s Residence. If I bring her to the palace now, wouldn\u2019t I get a scolding?\u201dShuanglu let out an \u201coh, my\u201d and smiled, then said, \u201cYour Majesty, you are the Emperor. You have the final say within this palace. How would those officials on the outside know what eunuchs in the inner palace does? We\u2019ll do it on the sly\u2026\u201dLi Jianheng instantly felt his spirits soar. Not even eating the candy anymore, he said, \u201cSecretariat Elder Hai won\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cNo one will know.\u201d Shuanglu shuffled forward on his knees. \u201cYou are our master. He isn\u2019t. Us slaves run errands for Your Majesty. If Your Majesty doesn\u2019t want to let anyone know, then no one will know.\u201d\u201cGreat!\u201d Li Jianheng clapped his hands. \u201cGreat, I finally found an opportunity. Go quickly, the sooner the better. Bring Mu Ru in. Pan Rugui is going to die. Remaining in that compound will only be inviting bad luck!\u201dIt rained again when Xiao Chiye left the palace. He felt vexed for no reason. The zeal and drive he had before the Autumn Hunt seemed to have dissipated overnight. He did not even want to draw his blade at this moment.Chen Yang and Zhao Hui came to pick him up, and Xiao Chiye got into the horse carriage. Halfway through their journey back, Xiao Chiye suddenly lifted the curtain and said, \u201cTell Father and\u00a0dage\u00a0that I won\u2019t be going back tonight.\u201dWithout waiting for both men to respond, he jumped off the carriage and headed towards Donglong Street without taking anything with him.\u201cHe\u2019s gone drinking again.\u201d Zhao Hui got off the carriage as well and said to Chen Yang, \u201cYou head back and inform the Prince and the\u00a0Hereditary Prince. I\u2019ll follow the Young Master. It wouldn\u2019t look good for him to get drunk and make a scene during a time when the nation is in mourning.\u201dChen Yang said, \u201cIn just the time it takes for you to say all these, you would have already lost sight of him. Since the Viceroy doesn\u2019t want anyone to follow, then\u2026 let him be.\u201dZhao Hui was Xiao Jiming\u2019s deputy general, while Chen Yang was Xiao Chiye\u2019s deputy general. Although both of them were members of the Xiao Clan, the subject of their consideration were ultimately different. Zhao Hui was more like the older brother.He turned his head in the rain. Sure enough, he could no longer see Xiao Chiye\u2019s figure.With the waist tokens of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0revoked, its subordinates were all temporarily assigned to the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0to serve as patrols.Shen Zechuan just finished his rounds tonight. As he returned home, he passed by the back alley of Xiangyun Villa19\u00a0on Donglong Street.Because it was just a drizzle, he did not hold up an umbrella.As he was walking along the road, he suddenly heard a bout of puking sounds before him. Then, a courtesan wearing wooden clogs and no socks trotted out in pursuit of the person who had been puking. The latter gently fended her off.Xiao Chiye propped himself up against the wall and pointed at the back door to motion to the woman to stay away from him.The courtesans of Xiangyun Villa were all well-acquainted with him. They knew that he would not let others touch him while he was drunk, so this courtesan folded a handkerchief and lay it at the side and said in a gentle voice, \u201cSecond Young Master, please go in again once you feel better. I\u2019ve prepared hot soup for you.\u201dXiao Chiye did not respond.The sound of wooden clogs receded into the distance, and he squatted down. His stomach was churning so badly it was hard to bear.This was the way a man should live\u2014eat, drink and make merry as if in a drunken stupor. He had only this one way out.He felt a sudden weight on his back.Xiao Chiye suddenly looked back with a stare so cold it would make one flustered. On seeing the man, he thought for a moment before saying, \u201c\u2026 Why did you kick me?\u201dShen Zechuan said without blinking, \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201dXiao Chiye backhandedly touched his own back for a moment. He pulled at his clothes and said stubbornly, \u201cThis is evidence of your guilt!\u201dShen Zechuan scrutinized him for a moment and said, \u201cHave you drunk yourself foolish, Xiao the Second?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cDo\u00a0 I look like a fool?\u201dWithout waiting for Shen Zechuan to reply, he answered himself.\u201cI\u2019m not a fool.\u201dSmelling him reeking of wine, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cDon\u2019t block my way. I want to go home.\u201dXiao Chiye turned his head back and stared blankly for a moment before saying to the wall, \u201cDon\u2019t block my way. I want to go home too.\u201dShen Zechuan was about to laugh when he heard him continue.\u201cIf I can\u2019t go home, then you can forget about going home as well.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 : FateShen Zechuan said, \u201cOh.\u201dNot getting the answer he wanted, Xiao Chiye looked back at him and asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you rebutting?\u201dShen Zechuan raised his hands to open up the umbrella and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a father or a brother back at home. No acquaintances either. So what\u2019s the point of going back?\u201dXiao Chiye picked up the handkerchief to wipe away the water on the back of his neck. He stood up and said, \u201cOh right. The Prince of Jianxing\u2019s Residence in Dunzhou has already been cleared out. With your identity, you will only be cursed by all if you go back.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why when it comes to fate,\u201d Shen Zechuan looked at Xiao Chiye quietly for a pause before continuing, \u201cyou will only suffer if you don\u2019t get reincarnated into a good life.\u201dXiao Chiye did not look at him as he lifted his arm to rub away the raindrops on his forehead. He said, \u201cThen why are you still alive?\u201dShen Zechuan smiled and said, \u201cMillions of people want me to die. But how could I feel at ease myself if I were to fulfill the wish of others?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cThe way for you to survive is to remain in Zhao Zui Temple.\u201dShen Zechuan took two steps to bypass the water puddle on the ground and said, \u201cIf I remain in Zhao Zui Temple, then you will think that getting executed by decapitation is how I should end up. Xiao Chiye, even if you try your best to hide it, you are already used to looking down from above. You are no different from the people who look down on you today. And all those eyes on you now agonize you.\u201dHe laughed out loud and patted Xiao Chiye on the back with a palm.\u201cI seek to live. You seek to die. The Xiao Clan once had me trapped, and now the Li Clan does the same to you. Isn\u2019t the ways of this world strange? The bird in the cage longs for its former woods, while the fish in the pond misses the deep.1\u00a0Your lot in life has been laid bare from start to end. If you can\u2019t go back, then you are nothing but a loser with lofty aspirations sans actions. The most regrettable thing in this world is to train a wolf into a dog. How long can your fangs remain sharp in\u00a0Qudu?\u201d\u201cYou followed me during the Autumn Hunt,\u201d Xiao Chiye turned his head to the side to look at him, \u201cand saved my life just for this moment of gratification?\u201d\u201cI am but an insignificant nobody.\u201d Shen Zechuan said softly, \u201cEven if I didn\u2019t show up, you will still live.\u201d\u201cExactly what,\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s inebriation had worn off. He asked, \u201care you up to?\u201d\u201cRepaying a debt of gratitude.\u201d The brim of Shen Zechuan\u2019s umbrella sheltered Xiao Chiye\u2014This was how close he was to the latter. \u201cRepaying all of you for your mercy in not killing me.\u201dXiao Chiye suddenly grabbed Shen Zechuan by the collar and said, \u201cI thought you had repent and turned over a new leaf to become a better person.\u201d\u201cWhat wrong did I do?\u201d The glint in Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes was even colder than this Autumn rain. He pressed in a step closer, almost sticking to Xiao Chiye, and asked, \u201cWhat is my crime?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you take a look at various cities of Duanzhou when you climbed your way out of Chashi Sinkhole?\u201d Xiao Chiye tightened his grip. \u201cEveryone in the eight cities was massacred. When the hooves of horses trod through the city gates, all the blood that splashed up was the people\u2019s blood.\u201d\u201cShen Wei\u2019s troops were defeated.\u201d Shen Zechuan finally tore off that mask of his, exposing his burning hatred. \u201c40,000 people from Zhongbo were buried in Chashi Sinkhole! I lost my elder brother and\u00a0shiniang\u00a0to death that day! Where does my fault lie in this?\u201d\u201cShen Wei deserves to be killed!\u201d Xiao Chiye reached the end of his limit too. He suddenly pressed Shen Zechuan up against the wall and said, \u201cShen Wei should be put to death! You are a Shen too! So how are you blameless?!\u201d2The oil-paper umbrella tumbled to the ground\u00a0as Xiao Chiye slammed Shen Zechuan into the wall and lifted him until his toes could barely touch the floor. Shen Zechuan lifted his leg to stomp on Xiao Chiye\u2019s chest. Xiao Chiye retreated a few steps back in pain, but he did not release his grip as he pulled Shen Zechuan by the collar and flung him to the ground.The pattering rain suddenly intensified and came pouring down in torrents. A burst of crashes rang out from the dark lane, as overturned odds and ends were trampled underfoot.The courtesans of Xiangyun Villa who had been waiting for Xiao Chiye were startled by the commotion. All of them held on to the doors with their wooden clogs in hands to look.\u201cWhy did they start fighting?!\u201d Xiangyun hurriedly draped on her upper, outer garment and slipped on her wooden clogs to rush over. \u201cMy dear masters! Talk it over if you have something to say. This isn\u2019t worth coming to blows over!\u201dShen Zechuan rode Xiao Chiye and punched the latter\u2019s head aside. Xiao Chiye grabbed Shen Zechuan\u2019s wrist and tugged him hard towards himself. Licking the blood between his teeth with the tip of his tongue, he said, \u201cNeither you nor I shall dream of having an easy time!\u201dXiangyun had already called out the hired help, and they joined forces to drag both men apart. Xiao Chiye jerked his arm, and those tall and strapping hirelings felt the webs between their thumbs and forefingers going numb. However, Xiao Chiye did not pounce again. He raised his fingers to wipe at the wound on his face and said, \u201cPiss off.\u201dSeeing that the situation did not look good, Xiangyun motioned for the hirelings to hurry over to the prince\u2019s residence to call for help.Who would have expected Xiao Chiye to say, \u201cI\u2019ll break the legs of whoever dares to alert my father!\u201dXiangyun\u2019s voice softened and she took the opportunity to say, \u201cWhat is this about? Second Young Master has always shown tenderness towards the fairer sex. Why did you frighten the ladies tonight? It is common for gentlemen to swap pointers with one another after a bout of drinking. Let\u2019s forget it and bury the hatchet with a smile, alright?\u201dXiao Chiye rose to his feet, stripped off his dirty robe, and threw it to Xiangyun. He said, \u201cGo in.\u201dHolding his outer robe, Xiangyun attempted to persuade him. \u201cSecond Young Master, it\u2019s so cold outside\u2026\u201dHer voice trailed off as she lost the courage to let out even a squeak. She waved her hand quietly at the courtesans and led them back inside. However, the door was not closed tight this time. All the courtesans clung to the sides of the door and windows to steal a peek.Shen Zechuan picked up the umbrella. He was so filthy all over he was barely recognizable. He had been drenched by the rain, and strands of hair stuck to his cheeks. The contrast of black on white made his fair skin look even whiter.\u201cNext time.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cGo right to my door if you want to look for me. I won\u2019t necessarily make a trip through this alley even in eight hundred years.\u201d\u201cIf I knew you would be passing by.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cI would not come here even if I have to puke all over inside.\u201dShen Zechuan smiled mockingly and said, \u201cThen it must really be a small world for enemies to meet on such a narrow path.\u201dXiao Chiye walked up to him. \u201cI\u2019ll watch you closely from now on.\u201d\u201cYou can hardly look after yourself, and you still want to concern yourself over me?\u201d Shen Zechuan raised his umbrella and pulled apart the distance between them. \u201cOld institutions die hard. Just one Autumn Hunt, and you want to bring the Hua Clan down to their knees. You are really delusional.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d better find a way to preserve your life.\u201d Xiao Chiye pressed his chest against the umbrella and looked askance at him. \u201cHow long can you live without the backing of the Empress Dowager?\u201d\u201cThere is already a new master sitting in the Imperial Court.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it time for you to change all those assumptions you have been taking for granted too?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t kill any of them.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThe ones who owe you are the Biansha Cavalry and Shen Wei.\u201d\u201cWhatever you say.\u201d Shen Zechuan draped on that layer of tame outer coat again. He closed his umbrella and said gently to Xiao Chiye, \u201cI\u2019ll listen to you, okay?\u201dThat indescribable rage within Xiao Chiye suddenly bubbled up. He said, \u201cSure. Then you\u2019ll stay with me tonight.\u201d\u201cYou sleep under the bed canopy of a sweet, tender lady.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cAnd you still have the fetish to share your bed with another man? I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t.\u201dNo matter how Xiao Chiye looked at him now he looked as though he was up to no good, so he said, \u201cWhat are you shying away from? Didn\u2019t you say, whatever I say?!\u201d\u201cAre you,\u201d Shen Zechuan pointed to his head, \u201cout of your mind?\u201d\u201cAll the idlers of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0have been assigned to the\u00a0Imperial Army.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cSo who is the one out of his mind?\u201dShen Zechuan paused for a moment and said, \u201cWhat does the Viceroy want me to do?\u201dThere was still a red imprint remaining on Xiao Chiye\u2019s cheek. The hostility between his eyebrows dissipated, and he took on the appearance of a lazy slacker. He turned around to sit on the veranda under the eaves and pointed to his own boots.Shen Zechuan unhurriedly moved the corners of his lips at him and said, \u201cSure.\u201dEarly in the morning the next day, Chen Yang came to pick him up, and was stunned when he saw Shen Zechuan hugging\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0at the entrance of Xiangyun Villa.Shen Zechuan, who had been leaning against the door, straightened up his body and bowed a greeting to Chen Yang.Chen Yang had an ill sense of foreboding for an instant and asked, \u201cShen\u2026 Why is the Red Cavalry3\u00a0 here?\u201d\u201cJi Lei is still in prison and has not yet been sentenced.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are temporarily serving as\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0under the Viceroy\u2019s supervision.\u201dChen Yang looked at his calm face and felt a chill down his spine. He gave a slight nod of his head and hurried up the stairs.Shen Zechuan watched him go upstairs. At the same time, Xiangyun was coming down the stairs while lifting the hem of her skirt. She said tenderly, \u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten yet right? You haven\u2019t changed out of those dirty clothes of yours either. Ling Ting\u2014\u201dThe courtesan upstairs leaned against the railing with a tired expression and said, \u201cWhy is Madam4\u00a0still calling out for Ling Ting? You are always forgetting that little lass has been redeemed.\u201d5It dawned on Xiangyun then, and she said, \u201cI have gotten used to calling her! Go and bring some food over for this Red Cavalry Excellency.\u201dWhen Chen Yang entered, he saw Xiao Chiye still sprawled on the couch sleeping. There was no one around attending to him, so Chen Yang went forward and called out to him softly, \u201cViceroy, Viceroy?\u201dXiao Chiye wearily buried his face and slept for a little longer. He suddenly sat up and asked, \u201cWhy is it you? Where is Shen Lanzhou?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s keeping watch downstairs. Viceroy\u2026 What happened to your face?\u201d Chen Yang asked in astonishment.\u201cGot punched while I was hunting.\u201d Xiao Chiye got off the couch and moved his shoulders and arms. He asked, \u201cDid\u00a0dage\u00a0ask you to come for me?\u201d\u201cIt was His Lordship the Prince.\u201d Chen Yang said, \u201cWe received information early in the morning. The Shaqiu6\u00a0Mutual Trade Market was looted by the Biansha Cavalry last night. We still need to enter the palace later to discuss this matter in detail. Secretariat Elder Hai has summoned the Ministry of War and the Ministry of Revenue for a convention. Us Libei have to deploy our troops again.\u201dXiao Chiye wiped his face with water and immediately stepped out of the door. When he headed downstairs, he saw Shen Zechuan with a courtesan. He strode a few steps down, grabbed the small plate from behind, and tossed a pastry into his mouth.Shen Zechuan looked at him and said. \u201cEat slowly. No one can save you in time if you choke to death.\u201dXiao Chiye swallowed it clean. He smiled at him and put his arm on his shoulder. Leading him outside, he said, \u201cLanzhou\u2026\u201dShen Zechuan looked at him.Xiao Chiye said frivolously, \u201cWhy do you still hold an overnight grudge? I\u2019ve already forgotten all about it after a sleep. Let\u2019s go. Second Young Master will take you along to look for fun\u2026\u201dShen Zechuan swatted his hand away with the sheath of his blade and said, \u201cSecond Young Master, don\u2019t take advantage of the chance to touch the back of my neck.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Many people gathered in Mingli Hall.Li Jianheng remained seated on the Dragon Throne, not daring to move. He first tried to figure out Hai Liangyi\u2019s expression with his eyes, then shifted them over to the others while trying his best to look dignified and imposing.\u201cNow that the Brush-holding Director of the\u00a0Directorate of Ceremonial\u2019s position is vacant, this old subject will present all the various ministries\u2019 accounts to His Majesty once they are sent to the Grand Secretariat before signing off on them.\u201d Hai Liangyi first said to Li Jianheng, \u201cWhat does Your Majesty think of the accounts last night?\u201dLi Jianheng had been listening to the pipa7\u00a0with a beautiful woman in his arms last night. So when Hai Liangyi kowtowed to him, he immediately shifted his buttocks with a guilty conscience and said, \u201cOkay, okay!\u201dXue Xiuzhuo, who had been kneeling behind Hai Liangyi, initially had on a neutral expression. But he furrowed his brows on hearing these words.Hai Liangyi waited for a while. But when he saw that Li Jianheng had no intention of saying further, he said, \u201cAutumn is cold and frosty at present. If Libei is to deploy troops, then they must report to\u00a0Qudu\u00a0the military salaries and provisions to be paid in advance. Your Lordship, how much do you need this time?\u201dXiao Fangxu smiled and said, \u201cI have been ill and out of commission for a long time. All the military affairs have long been entrusted to Jiming. Jiming, tell Secretariat Elder Hai how much money we lack.\u201dXiao Jiming kowtowed and said, \u201cThe Twelve Tribes of Biansha looted the market at this time because winter snow is about to fall. The grain supply of the various Biansha Tribes have run out, so they could only loot the mutual trade market. If this were in the past, the military fields of Libei can provide for itself and would not need assistance with army supplies. But the former Emperor passed away this year, so it\u2019s likely that the Twelve Biansha Tribes is thinking of taking the advantage of our vulnerability now. If we are to mobilize troops, then we must not only expel them out of our territory but also station our troops there to guard it. I have already submitted the required sum to the Ministry of Revenue.\u201dThe newly appointed Minister of Revenue took out the memorial.8\u00a0Shuanglu presented it to Li Jianheng.Li Jianheng looked at it for a moment and said, \u201c1.2 million taels. What\u2019s so hard about it? As long as the soldiers don\u2019t go cold and hungry.\u201dThe Minister of Revenue, Qian Jin, was a little embarrassed and said, \u201cYour Majesty does not know it but\u2026 we still have yet to make up for last year\u2019s deficiency. The State Treasury does not have that much money at such a short notice.\u201dLi Jianheng said, \u201cThen, 1 million taels should be fine, right?\u201dQian Jin kowtowed and said, \u201cDuring the Autumn Hunt, the mobilization of the Eight Great Training Divisions cost us 230,000 taels, and the former Emperor spent\u2026 540,000 taels. The remaining money in the State Treasury still has to be used to pay out salary arrears to all the senior and junior officials. It\u2019s soon to be the end of the year, and the civil officials all need to celebrate the New Year. We definitely do not have 1 million taels. Your Majesty, we can only allocate 600,000 taels to Libei\u2019s Armored Cavalry. \u201cLi Jianheng truly never expected there to be a day he would be poor as an Emperor. He had wanted to do Libei a favor, and doing so could placate Xiao Chiye too. Who would have thought that he would have no money? This suddenly put him in such an awkward spot that he wanted so much to dig his way under the table. Instead, he merely uttered a few vague sounds of acknowledgements.Mingli Hall went silent for a moment.Xue Xiuzhuo suddenly piped up, \u201cYour Majesty, this humble subject has a way.\u201dAs though he had seen his savior, Li Jianheng said, \u201cPlease speak. Tell me.\u201dXue Xiuzhuo said, \u201cWhen the Hua faction was in power, they put a price on some sinecures and welcomed everyone who could pay up. The \u2018ice respect\u20199\u00a0they collected every year were all large sums. Then, there\u2019s Pan Rugui who took advantage of the loopholes in procurement to amass wealth blatantly. Both men are now in prison. Why not search both the Hua\u2019s and Pan\u2019s residences and confiscate their possessions to subsidize the military funds? The Second Young Master of the Xi Clan, Xi Hongxuan, has already made amends and submitted a document to the Court of Judicial Review yesterday to report Xi Gu\u2019an of raising his own personal army in private. He even leased out the Xi Clan\u2019s residence in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to repay the empty accounts of the Eight Great Training Divisions while Xi Gu\u2019an was in office.\u201dThe moment Li Jianheng heard they were going to raid the residences, he instantly showed interest. Eager to give it a try, he said, \u201cSure! I\u2026 I10\u00a0have been thinking of this too!\u201dHai Liangyi hesitated for a moment, then said, \u201cThat\u2019s not appropriate. The Court of Judicial Review\u2019s retrial is not concluded yet. How can we bypass the law and carry out the sentence straight?\u201dXue Xiuzhuo said, \u201cIt\u2019s an emergency. We do not have a choice.\u00a0Qudu\u00a0can wait for the retrial, but the Biansha Cavalry will not. We cannot let Libei\u2019s Armored Cavalry fight a war on empty stomachs.\u201dHai Liangyi was still hesitating, but Li Jianheng had already slapped the table to give his approval.When they came out, Xiao Jiming said to Qi Zhuyin, who had been silent the whole time earlier, \u201cHow is the Bianjun Commandery holding up?\u201dQi Zhuyin raised her head to look up at the rain beyond the eaves and said, \u201cLu Guangbai is still at Bianjun, so the Twelve Tribes of Biansha will naturally not make a move. But Libei is lacking a chief commander; that makes it inevitably tricky for you.\u201dXiao Jiming stood for a moment and sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to come by men with military talents. They aren\u2019t easy to find.\u201dQi Zhuyin said, \u201cNo matter how the situation changes in\u00a0Qudu, it\u2019s the duty of the commanders and generals to protect his home and defend his country. Jiming, military talents are hard to come by, and it isn\u2019t easy to nurture and train them. Libei is a heavily fortified land at Dazhou\u2019s frontier. It will only prove to be detrimental to Libei if you still don\u2019t choose a successor.\u201dIt was the original aspiration of each and every one of them to be a valiant general of one side and to become an impregnable fortress of Dazhou. However, a man would eventually age.Entrusting and tethering the lives of an entire army to one person could be overlooked if it was just for a few years, but let it continue for more than a decade, or even a few decades, and the Libei\u2019s Armored Cavalry would turn into one that could not do without Xiao Jiming.If one day, the Libei\u2019s Armored Cavalry were to lose Xiao Jiming, then what would become of the army that had reigned supreme on the battlefield for decades without any blemish to its reputation?\u201cI know you have high hopes for A-Ye.\u201d Qi Zhuyin descended the stairs and turned her head back unhurriedly. \u201cBut he is destined to never fly out of\u00a0Qudu. You put your eyes on him. Do you think he never noticed it all these years even though you never spoke of it? The more expectation you have for him, the more agony he\u2019ll be in. Libei is not his wings, but his cage. Jiming, you and I have been buddies for many years. Let me give you a word of advice. Choose someone else.\u201dThe palace eaves in the far distance were all shrouded in fog. A lone crow cawed a few times, and silence descended once more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 : King of WolvesXiao Chiye seems to have forgotten having lost his cool last night. He spurred his horse on through the street, causing cries of discontent to rise all around from the stall vendors on both sides of the street. He hurried over to the palace gate just in time to see the horse carriage from the Xiao Clan\u2019s Prince Residence.Zhao Hui lifted the curtain for Xiao Fangxu and said, \u201cSecond Young Master is here.\u201dWith his hand on his knee, Xiao Fangxu looked out of the carriage. His gaze passed past his youngest son and landed upon the man inept in riding behind him\u2014Shen Zechuan. He paused for a moment, but said nothing. When Xiao Chiye arrived before him, he saw the injury on Xiao Chiye\u2019s face and asked, \u201cWhat did you do last night?\u201d\u201cI went drinking.\u201d Xiao Chiye reined in his horse and laughed as he held his horsewhip. \u201cI forgot the time. By the time I woke up, it was already late. Father, are you done with the discussion?\u201dXiao Fangxu nodded and asked, \u201cIs that Shen Wei\u2019s son?\u201dThe Autumn wind suddenly came assaulting Shen Zechuan in the face. It grazed past his temples. He met Xiao Fangxu\u2019s eyes and felt a shudder for no reason. His grip on the reins tightened in uneasiness.But Xiao Fangxu did nothing.The sideburns of Libei\u2019s old King of the Wolves were white. Even though he was sitting all hunched over in the horse carriage, one could still make out his extraordinary height and build. That commanding presence was not something anyone could develop overnight. It was a majestic dignity honed out of a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood. It was a formidable strength so tempered with bones and blood that even his 'sickness\u201d could not overshadow it.Xiao Chiye\u2019s naturally endowed, sturdy physique was completely inherited from his father. His shocking arm strength, exceptional height, wide shoulders and back, and explosively swift long legs, were all gifts from his father.Compared with the gentler and more elegant Xiao Jiming, Xiao Chiye was the true wolf pup. If one were to glance over while the two brothers stood together, there would be no doubt that Xiao Chiye was the one who gave off a more aggressive vibe.And now, the real King of Wolves was watching Shen Zechuan attentively. Despite already learning how to restrain himself, Shen Zechuan still had the strong urge to flee.This was utterly different from being pinned down by Xiao Chiye. This was a gaze that would make one shiver subconsciously.At this very moment, Shen Zechuan recalled Grand Mentor Qi\u2019s words.\u201cIt\u2019s Xiao Jiming\u2019s time to shine now that Xiao Fangxu is off-commission from illness. Everyone fears Xiao Jiming. But, Lanzhou, twenty years ago, the one who truly secured the frontier with his steed was Xiao Fangxu. From today\u2019s point of view, Qi Shiyu clearly has more authority of office as the Commander-in-chief of the Five Commanderies, but he has not been conferred the title of a prince.1\u00a0That is because Qidong is a \u2018bestowed fief belonging to the Emperor\u2019. The five commanderies are all founding lands of Dazhou that belong to the\u00a0Son of Heaven. But it\u2019s different for Libei. The vast territory of Libei stretches from Luoxia Pass to the end of Hongyan Mountain Ranges in the northeast, and these are all hard-won lands Xiao Fangxu led the Armored Cavalry of Libei to conquer inch by inch during the years of Yongyi!\u201cXiao Jiming is now the Commander-in-chief of Libei\u2019s Armored Cavalry. \u2018River of Ice Armored Cavalry\u2019\u2014How awe-inspiring. But it was Xiao Fangxu who established this powerful regiment of cavalry. The Libei\u2019s Armored Cavalry doesn\u2019t have a long history like the Bianjun Commandery Garrison Troops. They are heavy cavalry that Xiao Fangxu specially set up to deal a heavy blow to our external foes during the years of Yongyi when the Biansha Cavalry repeatedly invaded Luoxia Pass. Libei\u2019s battle steeds, Libei\u2019s soldiers, and Libei\u2019s steel blades with hanging chains\u2026 Every symbol of the Libei\u2019s Armored Cavalry you can see today all came from Xiao Fangxu.\u201d\u201cThe\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0have forcibly entrenched themselves in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0For a long time. They are the sores and ulcers of Dazhou. The Xiao Clan can stand up to the Hua Clan as equals because Xiao Fangxu\u2019s status is secure in Libei. As long as Xiao Fangxu is alive, the Xiao Clan will be the towering tree firmly rooted in Libei! The title of the King of Wolves is, by no means, undeserved.\u201dXiao Chiye looked back and said, \u201c\u2026 He\u2019s Shen Wei\u2019s son.\u201dShen Zechuan dismounted and paid his obeisances to Xiao Fangxu.Xiao Fangxu looked at him for a moment and said, \u201cShen Wei is already dead, and his child is innocent. Since the former Emperor has let you out, that means he has absolved you of guilt. But why are you following this lad?\u201dShen Zechuan kneeled on one knee and hung his head down to say, \u201cThis humble servant was assigned to the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. Now that it\u2019s now temporarily under the\u00a0Imperial Army, I\u2019m at the Viceroy\u2019s disposal.\u201d\u201cSo I see.\u201d Xiao Fangxu looked towards Xiao Chiye. \u201cAnd why are you making things difficult for him?\u201dXiao Chiye licked the wound in his mouth and said, \u201cHow would I make things difficult for him? He and I are now sworn friends. Isn\u2019t that right, Lanzhou?\u201dWithout looking at Shen Zechuan again, Xiao Fangxu started to chat with Xiao Chiye.Shen Zechuan propped himself up with a knee and looked at Xiao Chiye\u2019s unrestrained smile and the way Xiao Fangxu gazed at his son through the puddle of water on the ground.Splashes of raindrops messed up the scene in the puddle.Shen Zechuan retracted his gaze.By the time Xiao Jiming emerged, Xiao Fangxu had already left. Qi Zhuyin walked a few steps with him and suddenly asked, \u201cWho is that?\u201dXiao Jiming looked beside Zhao Hui and replied without a change in expression, \u201cThat\u2019s Shen Zechuan.\u201dQi Zhuyin halted in her tracks and said with some surprise, \u201cShen Wei\u2019s son? Why is he following A-ye?\u201dXiao Jiming said, \u201cA-ye is playful. Most likely, he\u2019s making things hard for him.\u201dQi Zhuyin looked for a long time before saying, \u201cThat appearance of his is too outstanding. I heard that his mother was a dancer from Duanzhou. Fortunately, she was a dancer from Duanzhou and not the Cangjun Commandery.\u201dCommander-in-chief Qi Shiyu was the most fond of beauties. He was a man who would not move his feet whenever he saw a pretty woman. Although Qi Zhuyin had very few brothers, she had countless\u00a0yiniang2\u00a0back at home.\u201cSpeaking of which.\u201d Qi Zhuyin turned sideways. \u201cA-ye is already twenty-three years of age, right? Isn\u2019t he going to marry a wife?\u201d\u201cYizhi is also getting anxious on his behalf.\u201d Xiao Jiming said. \u201cLibei doesn\u2019t need him to marry a noble lady from a powerful and honorable clan. Just a girl from an ordinary family with a clean background will do. Yizhi keeps sending portraits of all the Libei women she picked out on his behalf to\u00a0Qudu\u00a0every year, but not one of them has ever caught his fancy.\u201dQi Zhuyin laughed. \u201cA noble lady tends to be haughty; she can\u2019t play with him. While a common girl is too timid; she will get frightened the moment she\u2019s near him. Besides, how many maidens can handle that temper of his? Finding someone who he is mutually in love with and vice versa is harder than ascending to Heaven. What\u2019s more, he loves to make his way to the alleys of pleasure houses. You\u2019d better keep an eye on him, or he\u2019ll really bring a courtesan back to marry one day.\u201dXiao Jiming knew that her stepmothers were all famous courtesans in Qidong. They would kick up such a row in the backyard all day long that she would always get a headache the moment she got home. That was why she had detested courtesans ever since she was young.\u201cWho can stop him if he really meets someone he fancies?\u201d Xiao Jiming felt like letting out a long sigh. He said with a headache. \u201cEven ten bulls won\u2019t be able to haul him home.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d better prepare for rainy days.\u201d Qi Zhuyin thought for a moment. \u201cNever mind about all the others, but her personality must not be too intense. Your Yizhi is gentle by nature. If he brings home someone with a temper, then Yizhi would have to suffer indignities every day, wouldn\u2019t she?\u201d\u201cNothing has even begun to take shape yet.\u201d3\u00a0Xiao Jiming suddenly laughed out loud. \u201cIt\u2019s still too early.\u201d\u201cMarriages are the most unpredictable.\u201d Qi Zhuyin laughed too. \u201cPerhaps someday he will see the light?\u201dXiao Chiye felt as though there was a chill on his back. He looked back warily and saw Shen Zechuan standing beside Zhao Hui, looking contemplative.\u201cI\u2019ll go to the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0Office in a while to collect the waist token.\u201d Xiao Chiye blocked the light in front of Shen Zechuan. \u201cBefore the final deployment order of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0is given, you will have to follow me day and night.\u201d\u201cDay and night.\u201d Shen Zechuan repeated the words and looked up at him. \u201cDo I still have to\u00a0 lift the chamber pot for the Second Young Master at night?\u201d\u201cIf you want to, then sure.\u201d Xiao Chiye took a step closer. \u201cI\u2019m busy these few days. I have to stay at the residence behind the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0office.\u201dShen Zechuan did not answer.Xiao Chiye had already turned around to receive Xiao Jiming.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8The review of the Court of Judicial Review had yet to conclude when both the Hua and Pan residences were searched and seized. Li Jianheng took the opportunity to close off access to the Empress Dowager\u2019s Enci Palace on the grounds that the Empress Dowager was \u201ctroubled by worries to the point of anxiety.\u201dWith some difficulty, enough money was finally gathered to make up for the shortfall in Libei\u2019s military fund for salaries and provisions. Xiao Fangxu and Xiao Jiming could not stay for long, and so they left a few days after.Xiao Chiye unexpectedly did not look reluctant to part with them. It was as if he had abandoned the ambitions he had during the Autumn Hunt after that night of inebriation. From time to time, Li Jianheng would bestow him with rewards, and each time, he would accept it with delight.Not only that, he also started to loaf on the job. Originally, the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0had the important task of conducting patrols. But he worked in fits and starts like the fisherman who fished for three days and dried the net for two days.4\u00a0There was often no sight of him where he should be. The Ministry of War gradually began to voice their doubts about him as they grew more inclined to have him replaced.But Li Jianheng refused to agree and even used the tactics of making a scene and throwing his tantrum. He even went to the extent of almost falling out with the Vice Minister of the Ministry of War who presented the petition.He flung away the memorial5\u00a0from the Vice Minister of the Ministry of War and said, \u201cXiao Ce\u2019an has made great contributions in coming to my rescue. Why isn\u2019t he up to being the Viceroy of the\u00a0Imperial Army? It\u2019s not like he has bungled matters or held things up. I won\u2019t replace him!\u201dBoth men reverted to the way they were before the Autumn Hunt, and Li Jianheng felt a little more relaxed. The Xiao Chiye of that night was more like a figment of his imagination, while this man without an iota of decorum was his buddy.Li Jianheng also felt glad that Xiao Chiye did not mention a word about returning to Libei. He was of the view that this was his buddy\u2019s consideration of his situation. There was really nothing he could do! And it was still possible to play while remaining in\u00a0Qudu, wasn\u2019t it? Now that he had even become the Emperor, Xiao Chiye could throw his weight around as he liked given their relationship, no?!So why return to Libei? How could that bitter cold land be as comfortable and carefree as in\u00a0Qudu?!When Xiao Chiye wanted to head out of the city to race his horse, Li Jianheng approved it. When Xiao Chiye wanted to expand the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0Office, Li Jianheng approved it too. And when Xiao Chiye wanted to be on duty for half a day and idle at home for the other half, Li Jianheng not only approved it, he even approved it with great delight.When both men had nothing to do, they would ride horses and play ball. Li Jianheng could not head for Donglong Street to fool around, but he could ask Xiao Chiye over to listen to the pipa6\u00a0together with him. That Mu Ru now lived in Mingli Hall. Li Jianheng originally thought that Xiao Chiye would say a few words of admonishments. Instead, Xiao Chiye said nothing and merely joined in the fun with him.It feels so fucking good to be an Emperor!During the last rain in\u00a0Qudu, Xi Gu\u2019an was sentenced to execution by decapitation by the Court of Judicial Review. Because Xi Hongxuan distributed his wealth and sought forgiveness, he got into Li Jianheng\u2019s good graces and was transferred to the Ministry of Revenue where he took up a modest position. Xi Hongxuan was originally adept at having fun, and this was just perfect for Li Jianheng, so Xi Hongxuan would go looking for Li Jianheng every day to offer him suggestions on what and how to play.Xi Gu\u2019an had only just been sentenced when Hua Siqian committed suicide by biting off his tongue in the prison. In the testimony he gave, he shouldered all the crimes without so much a word implicating the Empress Dowager. At present, it was just Ji Lei and Pan Rugui who had yet to be sentenced. Hai Liangyi wanted to pry a confession out of these two men\u2019s mouths, but he never succeeded.It was not until the house was damp that Shen Zechuan returned. As soon as he opened the door, he saw an eastern pearl7\u00a0on the table. Shen Zechuan closed the door. He had only just picked up the pearl in his hand when he heard Chen Yang knocking on the door.He opened the door, and Chen Yang said, \u201cThe Viceroy is calling for you.\u201dShen Zechuan grasped the eastern pearl in his hand. The strip of cloth it came with was soaked. He said naturally, \u201cI\u2019ll go once I change my clothes.\u201dChen Yang said, \u201cDon\u2019t bother. Just go like this. The Viceroy doesn\u2019t have the patience to wait for others.\u201dWith that, he took a step aside, wanting to leave together with Shen Zechuan. Shen Zechuan could only let his hands drop and stride out of the door to leave with Chen Yang.Xiao Chiye was wearing a cloak. When he saw him coming, he said, \u201cTake the blade and come with me.\u201dShen Zechuan went out of the door. It was only when Xiao Chiye led the horse over that Shen Zechuan realized Chen Yang had not followed them.Xiao Chiye got up the horse, and the gyrfalcon shook the water droplets off its neck before landing on Xiao Chiye\u2019s shoulder. Shen Zechuan could only follow after him. The horse left the city and braved the rain to head for the military drill grounds at Mount Feng.When they arrived at the drill grounds, it was empty and void of people. Xiao Chiye removed the reins for\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0and gave it a pat to let it run around to play by itself. Meng flew under the veranda, unwilling to soak in the rain any longer.\u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d Xiao Chiye turned around and said to Shen Zechuan as he untied his cloak.Shen Zechuan held the blade in his arms and raised his chin. The water trickled down the front of his clothes, exposing that fair, delicate neck of his.Xiao Chiye felt just like a person seeing a cat every time he looked at Shen Zechuan\u2019s neck; he always could not help wanting to give it a few rubs.What the heck is wrong with him?He had already taken off his outer garment while he was thinking. When he saw Shen Zechuan still not moving, he urged again, \u201cWhat are you standing there blankly for? Strip quickly!\u201dShen Zechuan raised his fingers and placed them on his own waist belt. He glanced at him and said slowly, \u201cIf I strip, there will be nothing left.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 : Nape\u201cThen all the more for you to strip.\u201d Xiao Chiye took off his arm guards and set them on the wooden ledge under the eaves together with his cloak and outer garment. The soldiers in the inner hall of the military drill grounds wanted to come over to pay their obeisances, but he raised a hand to stop them. He turned around to look calmly at Shen Zechuan and said, \u201cThat\u2019d be just perfect for me to see and experience for myself the difference between a body trained by the Ji Clan\u2019s mental cultivation techniques and mine.\u201d\u201cSince we are from the same school of martial arts.\u201d Shen Zechuan set\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0at the side. \u201cThen the stances and moves are naturally the same.\u201d\u201cNot necessarily so.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cMy\u00a0shifu\u00a0incorporated an external boxing style1\u00a0into it, so it was already quite different from the Ji Clan Boxing Style by the time it was imparted to me. If they were identical, you wouldn\u2019t have been totally oblivious of the fact that night.\u201d\u201cIf you want to exchange pointers, then just say so.\u201d Shen Zechuan slid a leg out in an arc. \u201cWhy speak of stripping? You sound just like a beast.\u201dIn that very instant, Xiao Chiye felt as though Shen Zechuan had suddenly turned into another person. Rainwater and mountain fog overlapped, washing out Shen Zechuan\u2019s facial features. In contrast, his slender body became all the more striking.\u201cMy wish is to be a beast in human clothing.\u201d Xiao Chiye strode down the stairs and stepped into the curtain of rain. \u201cI gave you a kick five years ago. Do you hate me for it?\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cIf I say yes, wouldn\u2019t that mean I have been tossing and turning having sleepless nights thinking of you? So nope. I don\u2019t hate you at all.\u201dXiao Chiye struck up a starting stance and said, \u201cWhat a pity. If you hate me, then you can get your revenge today.\u201dAmid the biting cold wind, Xiao Chiye slowly added on, \u201c\u2014That is, if you can.\u201dRaindrops came pitter-pattering down, bouncing for a few steps before spreading their wings on the veranda. At this moment, Xiao Chiye sprang up in the rain to make his move first.He threw out a punch, only to strike at empty air. But the vigor and strength of his blow sent the water droplets flying and splashing onto Shen Zechuan\u2019s cheeks.Having missed his target with that strike, Xiao Chiye swept his arm to the left. Shen Zechuan blocked his blow with a lightning move of his hand. When both men\u2019s arms collided, Shen Zechuan frowned from the pain and retreated a few steps back.Ji Clan\u2019s Boxing Style!Shen Zechuan pursed his lips into a tight line,\u00a0 but laughed out loud instead.Shifu\u2019s boxing style was steady and robust.\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er2\u00a0obviously lacked the steadiness but was far more ferocious. His strength was too astonishing. Just a collision like this, and the impact had already numbed Shen Zechuan\u2019s arm.The Ji Clan\u2019s Boxing Style was meant to be imparted to this kind of man, because his internal and external constitution all made it particularly suitable for him to train in it. Xiao Chiye\u2019s physique granted him the qualification to hold the various heroes in contempt. But was receiving an unfair advantage from Heaven the crux to determining victory?What Shen Zechuan did not believe the most was the fate Heaven decided for them!Shen Zechuan raised a leg up, and raindrops suddenly went splashing towards Xiao Chiye. His leg sweep3\u00a0was quick and brutal. Any other ordinary person would home in on the advantageous and avoid the dangerous; thus, they would first evade an incoming attack.But Xiao Chiye just had to meet difficulties head-on. He lifted his arm to block and fend off Shen Zechuan\u2019s leg with a \u201cthud\u201d, then strode a steady step forward.It was too late for Shen Zechuan to retract his leg. Facing off Xiao Chiye was just like facing off a tiger or a leopard poised for action. A wavering heart, an evasive gaze, an avoidant stance\u2014As long as he showed any signs of these, Xiao Chiye would instantly storm in. He would never miss any opportunity to attack his opponent.Letting Xiao Chiye go on the defensive was much easier to deal with than letting Xiao Chiye go on the offensive!Shen Zechuan exerted force with his leg, and the pressure slightly slowed down Xiao Chiye\u2019s movement. In a twinkling of an eye, Shen Zechuan was lifted into the air by Xiao Chiye. He leaned his entire body back, supported his weight with both arms on the ground, and straightened back up like a soft willow in the wind. The moment he sprang back to his feet, he swept his leg out again.Once again, Xiao Chiye bent his arm to block it. This time, his eyes were calm as he said, \u201cAn ant trying to shake a tree.4\u00a0Should I diss you for overrating your abilities, or should I commend you for your courage?\u201dXiao Chiye had only just said this when he backhandedly grabbed Shen Zechuan\u2019s calf. His shoulder sank as he attempted to flip Shen Zechuan over to the ground.Having already been swung up, Shen Zechuan made use of the momentum and stepped on Xiao Chiye\u2019s shoulder. That amazing waist strength of his came into play again as his legs twisted around Xiao Chiye\u2019s neck and spun him over to the ground together with him.Xiao Chiye\u2019s palm slid straight up along this straightness and hooked around the spot that had bent into an arch earlier. The suppleness in his palm was so smooth it was incredible.He simply wanted to touch Shen Zechuan.Because he could not fathom it. Whether it was the Ji Clan\u2019s Boxing Style or the Ji Clan\u2019s Broadsword Style, as long as a person trained all the year-round, his body muscles would definitely, and visibly, develop. But Shen Zechuan not only concealed it to the extent it looked as though he had never trained in martial arts, but also to the extent that both Chen Yang and Qiao Tianya were taken in, thinking him to be morbidly weak and sick due to a deficiency of vital energy and blood.5Shen Zechuan lifted his body off the ground and slammed his elbow towards Xiao Chiye\u2019s head. Xiao Chiye tilted his head to dodge the blow. He held on tight to Shen Zechuan\u2019s waist and pinned him against his own chest, then felt his way up from the latter\u2019s waist to his chest.The eastern pearl6\u00a0was still hidden in his bosom!The moment Shen Zechuan\u2019s back bumped into Xiao Chiye, he clasped hold of Xiao Chiye\u2019s arm and flung him over his shoulder into the rain.The spray of water instantly wetted his hair.Shen Zechuan wanted to retreat, but Xiao Chiye unexpectedly hooked him with his long leg and sent him tripping towards himself. Shen Zechuan\u2019s body was already tilting towards Xiao Chiye, but in that very instant, he trod on the water and gradually stabilized himself just like the reverberations of the strings on a qin.7Xiao Chiye straightened up and threw himself forward again. His hook struck at empty air, but he touched a lock of Shen Zechuan\u2019s long hair that had fluttered up in the rain as the latter spun around in a retreat to evade his blow.The rain-soaked lock of hair longingly slipped past Xiao Chiye\u2019s fingertips as if wanting for more, causing him to feel a wet itch.\u201cNot fighting anymore.\u201d Xiao Chiye suddenly clenched his fist and looked at Shen Zechuan. \u201cThe rain has gotten heavier.\u201dShen Zechuan looked back and asked, \u201cHave you touched enough?\u201dWithout batting an eyelid, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cNot soft, but not hard either.\u201dShen Zechuan said a little mockingly, \u201cI thought you were going to tear off all my clothes.\u201d\u201cIf I really wanted to.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cWe would be baring all of ourselves to each other right now.\u201d8With that, he raised his other hand and waved the thin blade Shen Zechuan always carried with him.\u201cThe Ji Clan\u2019s mental cultivation techniques need to be paired with the broadsword. Even if you use these things every day, you will not be able to defeat me in this lifetime. If you can\u2019t beat me, then how are you going to take revenge?\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s thin blades were originally hidden on the outside of his thighs. He glanced down, then looked at Xiao Chiye again. He said, \u201cFighting and killing will hurt relationships. Isn\u2019t it more pleasant to play the fool together?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cI only fear that you are hiding a blade behind your smile9\u00a0to stab me when I\u2019m the least unaware.\u201d\u201cOnly the word lust has a blade above it.\u201d10\u00a0Shen Zechuan spread out his hands. \u201cSecond Young Master is a gentleman. What\u2019s there to fear?\u201dXiao Chiye placed the thin blade in Shen Zechuan\u2019s palm and said unhurriedly, \u201cI\u2019ve just said that I\u2019m a beast in human clothing. Why do you always see me as a gentleman?\u201dShen Zechuan wanted to retract his hand.But Xiao Chiye grabbed him by the wrist and said, \u201cSeeing as you are so obedient today, this Second Young Master will take you someplace that\u2019ll make you feel good.\u201d\u201cViceroy.\u201d Shen Zechuan suddenly said with a severe countenance, \u201cPlease, I\u2019m not into men. Let us just part on good terms without hard feelings. Why pester me to such an extent?\u201dXiao Chiye was momentarily dumbfounded, then he turned his head to the side and saw a whole bunch of\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0soldiers clinging all over the doors and windows of the military drill grounds inner hall to watch the show.The Vice Commander of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0was the scar-faced man who led his men to kill the Eight Great Training Divisions that night. He clutched the window and took the lead to jeer.\u201cFighting like a hoodlum taking liberties. Viceroy, what the hell?! You never smiled at us when you lecture us every day!\u201d\u201cThat was pestering he said!\u201d They winked meaningfully at each other and started heckling, \u201cHow could that be the same?! The Viceroy is twenty-three now, and he has no wife at home to dote on. So all the energy in him has to be expended on someone else. It\u2019s not the same!\u201dXiao Chiye sensed that Shen Zechuan was going to run and so he pulled the latter hard towards himself. He said with a superficial smile, \u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m into pestering others. Lanzhou, why are you running? I\u2019m not done pestering you! The reason you aren\u2019t into men is that you have yet to get a sweet taste of them. Second Young Master will teach you.\u201dWhen it came to being shameless and stupid, he, Xiao Chiye, would only concede defeat to Li Jianheng. Who wouldn\u2019t know the trick of forcing yourself on someone else? Shen Zechuan was really belittling him by trying to use this kind of cheap trick to embarrass him.Without giving Shen Zechuan the chance to reply, Xiao Chiye dragged him away.Behind them, Tantai Hu touched his scar and asked the soldier beside him, \u201cWho\u2019s that man? I\u2019ve never seen him in our\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0before!\u201d\u201cHis surname is Shen.\u201d The man beside him winked. \u201cThe one from Zhongbo.\u201dThe smile on Tantai Hu\u2019s face cooled. He propped himself up with his arms to stick his head out, then looked back and said, \u201cHe\u2019s that fucking Shen who brought disaster upon Zhongbo? What\u2019s the Viceroy doing with him! Shen Wei caused the death of so many people. Even eight heads of his aren\u2019t enough for us to behead! The Prince of Jianxing\u2019s Manor has already been wrecked by others. Yet he\u2019s still eating and living well in\u00a0Qudu. The orphans who have lost their parents on the Chashi River frontline are still gnawing on mud! Fuck this! Why didn\u2019t you tell me earlier?!\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xiao Chiye led Shen Zechuan up Mount Feng.There was a narrow flight of stone steps in the mountain. The stream soaked through the soles of their shoes, chilling them to their bones. But Xiao Chiye did not even look back as he parted the maple leaves dripping with water and made his way onto a path. Their shoes sank into the mud they trod upon as they walked farther in with uneven steps.Less than an hour later, Xiao Chiye stopped in his tracks.The thatched cottage in the misty rain was small and exquisite, but it did not look like a place to live in.He turned sideways and said to Shen Zechuan, \u201cYou saved me once in the Nanlin Hunting Grounds. As a reward, I\u2019ll share half of this place with you.\u201d\u201cThe reward I want is cold, hard cash.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201c\u2026 not soaking in a bath together.\u201d\u201cMoney and fame are merely worldly possessions.\u201d Xiao Chiye stretched out both arms to lift the fabric curtain and enter. He stood at the entrance to strip off his attire and shouted, \u201cThis place is one that even the Emperor\u2019s old man himself had never enjoyed before.\u201dShen Zechuan lifted the curtain and saw Xiao Chiye\u2019s bare upper body. The contours of the muscles on the back of his shoulders were clean and neat, like a physique sculpted with a chisel.Other than a small clothes rack with curvy raised ends11\u00a0in the house, there was only a hot spring that led out. Xiao Chiye hung up his clothes on one side of the clothes rack. The other end was obviously reserved for him.Xiao Chiye took off his boots, looked back at Shen Zechuan, and said, \u201cDo you want to turn your back to me and strip, or do you want to strip while watching me?\u201dPulling at his waist belt, Shen Zechuan turned his back. The eastern pearl landed in his palm, and he conveniently put it away into his sleeve. The gaze on his back never shifted away. Shen Zechuan\u2019s hand paused for a moment before he pulled off his own outer garment.Xiao Chiye watched that garment slip to the ground. The fairness of Shen Zechuan\u2019s neck finally extended downward, very much like pear blossom rice paper immersed in moonlight. His back looked so thin and smooth.Xiao Chiye thought.That\u2019s right. It was as if he had been staring at Shen Zechuan\u2019s nape all for this very moment.How could a man\u2019s nape produce such breathtaking beauty? This was beyond everything Xiao Chiye had seen and heard in the past. It not only surprised him, but also baffled him.The fangs of the little wolf from Libei were sharp, but he had never bitten such a neck before, nor had he ever bitten such a man. His gaze slid down from Shen Zechuan\u2019s nape with a strength that felt like a caress, moving along that slightly heaving contour as it made its way farther down and down.Smooth.Xiao Chiye\u2019s mouth felt parched. He suddenly returned to his senses with a jolt and hurriedly averted his gaze.I must be mad!He thought.There were so many courtesans on Donglong Street! Which one of them wasn\u2019t a genuine beauty? Why was he looking at a man\u2019s back as though he was burning with hunger?Xiao Chiye used to turn his nose up at people who were seduced by beautiful women, because\u00a0the elders and seniors he admired were all men of resolute will. Every one of them could be said to be a true gentleman with the air of a man untempted by lust even with a beautiful woman in their laps.12Just like his father, his brother, his\u00a0shifu.The famous generals of the world changed generation after generation. But he had never admired Qi Shiyu before precisely because Qi Shiyu was a lecher. After the battle in Zhongbo, the one he loathed the most was Shen Wei, and it was because Shen Wei was not only guilty of monstrous crimes, but was also lecherous!But at this moment, he felt a little dizzy as that bestial instinct, captivated by beauty and stirred by desires, once again showed signs of rearing its head.Xiao Chiye strained himself to rein in his gaze and vividly felt the contradiction between his mind and his desire. He did not love this man, but because of this man\u2019s loveliness, the desire to embrace him, ravage him, and tear at him with his teeth sprang up within him for the second time.\u201cAren\u2019t you going in?\u201d Shen Zechuan was completely oblivious as he turned back and approached him, unperturbed.Xiao Chiye responded in an angry voice. \u201c\u2026Duh!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 : Mountain Night StayThick, steaming mist, coupled with the drumming sound of the rain.Shen Zechuan was about to enter and soak in the water. As he bent down, Xiao Chiye, who was behind him, got a clear look at the curvy contours of his waist and buttocks, which became more and more conspicuous with each of his movements.Has muscles. Very toned.But he did not look like a martial arts practitioner the slightest. Because the way Xiao Chiye saw it, he did not have that threatening vibe.Shen Zechuan submerged himself into the water. His legs, which had soaked in the rain until it was cold, gradually warmed up. Xiao Chiye entered the water and leaned far away from him at the other end.Shen Zechuan asked in astonishment, \u201cWhy are you hiding so far away?\u201d\u201cIt pleases me to.\u201d Xiao Chiye roughly folded the wet handkerchief to cover his eyes, then put up his arms without looking at Shen Zechuan again.But after a moment, Xiao Chiye found it inappropriate, so he raised his hand to pull off the handkerchief and stared fixedly at Shen Zechuan. Shen Zechuan felt that\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0was very much like his gyrfalcon right this moment; it was as if he would start going on the offensive with just a little jab.\u201cWhat do you want to see?\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s expression was as warm as the spring breeze as he used the tone of one cajoling a child eating candied hawthorns1\u00a0on the street. \u201cTell me. I\u2019ll let you see.\u201dXiao Chiye bent up a leg and pulled off the only remaining cover around his waist without batting an eyelid. He said, \u201cI\u2019ve already touched them all earlier.\u201dShen Zechuan sank a little lower into the water, exposing only a pair of eyes to look at him.Xiao Chye felt even more irritable being sized up by that gaze of his. He said, \u201cWhat?\u201dShen Zechuan revealed his lower jaw and replied, \u201cYou were in a good mood earlier. Why the sudden change?\u201d\u201cMy mood right now is also pretty good.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cSoaking in the bath means one can shut up; There is no need to talk\u2026 Can you stop looking up at me like that?\u201dShen Zechuan slowly lifted his body, and the water trickled down along his chest. His scattered hair spread out like ink saturating the water. It was as if he was a magnolia flower climbing out among this water mist.Xiao Chiye could not stand it anymore.Why had he thought of \u201cflower\u201d?He watched with wide-open eyes as Shen Zechuan came closer to him. He could even smell Shen Zechuan\u2019s scent when the latter sat beside him.Not fragrant. Mild scent. Feel like catching a few more whiffs.Xiao Chiye retracted the arms he had put up at the edges and suddenly pulled over a garment from the clothes rack. He stuffed all of it into the water to cover up his waist. After doing this, he looked calmly at Shen Zechuan and said, \u201cWhat? Surprised? I\u2019m afraid you might get funny ideas at the sensual sight of Second Young Master; hence, the cover.\u201d\u201cThen I thank you\u2026\u201d Shen Zechuan said with a displeased expression.Xiao Chiye lowered his head, only to realize that the clothing he had pulled off belonged to Shen Zechuan.\u201c\u2026For washing my clothes on my behalf.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cNow I\u2019ll have to soak in here until tomorrow.\u201dThe awkward silence permeated through the air rapidly as both men looked at each other. Outside, the wind rustled amid the cold and dismal autumn rain.After a long while, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThis clothing won\u2019t dry even if we leave it be. Meng can go and call Chen Yang over.\u201dWith that, he raised his head and whistled.There was a moment\u2019s silence in the hot spring. Neither\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0nor Meng came.Xiao Chiye whistled again.Outside, Meng shrank its head under its wing and ignored him. Such a heavy rain\u2014it had absolutely no wish to fly out and get itself wet.The silence seemed endless.Eventually, Shen Zechuan said, \u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll wring it dry.\u201dXiao Chiye pressed the clothes back down, and said while gnashing his teeth at him, \u201cWait a moment!\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Both men were stranded in the hot springs for a night. By the time their clothes dried, it was already the hour of\u00a0mao.2\u00a0Shen Zechuan finally put on his clothes at long last. As he secured his waist belt, he could still sense that ravenous gaze of a tiger eyeing its prey. But he said nothing and feigned unawareness.Xiao Chiye lifted the hanging screen. It was still dark outside. The air was thick with mountain fog and the scent of dampness after a rain. It was inconvenient to head down the mountain, as the stone stairs were all covered in thin ice.Both men moved in a single file, with one in front and one at the back.\u201cThe military drill grounds occupy the southwestern side of Mount Feng.\u201d Shen Zechuan surveyed the place from above. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s very close to\u00a0Qudu, its view is completely blocked by Mount Feng. The Eight Great Training Division won\u2019t conduct their patrols here. Your location choice is really excellent.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have chosen this land if not for Mount Feng.\u201d Xiao Chiye pushed aside the maple branches and turned back to indicate to Shen Zechuan to make his way over under his arm.Shen Zechuan passed under it. The scenery before him suddenly opened up as all the obstructions turned to mist. He could see the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s military drill grounds clearly. There were already squads running around the grounds.\u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0did not make a move during the Autumn Hunt.\u201d Shen Zechuan sized it up for a moment and said, \u201cBut I can see that they are all fully equipped. Hua Siqian is dead now, the moment the seizure of his assets following the Autumn Hunt is concluded, the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0will be coming for you.\u201dXiao Chiye obviously could not afford to raise 20,000\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0soldiers based on his salary alone, and he could not misappropriate the military salary and provisions of the Libei Armored Cavalry either. But going by the annual budget the Ministry of Revenue allocated to him before the Autumn Hunt, the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0obviously would not have the money to establish themselves on such a scale. Xi Gu\u2019an died because he \u201ccould not explain\u201d himself. And now, it was time for them to be demanding answers from Xiao Chiye.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cLet them come.\u201dAs for where the money had come from, he did not speak further on the issue, and Shen Zechuan did not ask again.After a while, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cMany errands from the Ministry of Works requiring manual labor were all handed to the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0to be carried out. Since five years ago, every sum of money paid out to the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0for the assignments were all recorded down in black and white in the account books. Even if the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0investigates it, they won\u2019t be able to find anything nefarious.\u201dIt was for this reason that Xiao Chiye became the infamous debt collector in the Ministry of Revenue. All of them thought he was asking for money to spend on women and wine. They did not know that he was actually saving money over the years, and that the only account he had that could be said to be an extravagant expense was money for wine. Li Jianheng might be muddle-headed, but he was generous when it came to his buddies. Every time he invited Xiao Chiye to Donglong Street, he was the one who paid out of his own pocket for the girls and for the feasts to treat his bunch of disreputable friends .Li Jianheng lived off government coffers, and he had no principal wife to keep him in line. If he had no money, he would ask the palace for it. Emperor Xiande had never been stingy with him when it came to him spending money. Even if he had to take the funds from his own coffers, he would also give him the money. So, Li Jianheng never lacked money.Xiao Chiye did not manage to return to Libei, but he had never resented Li Jianheng for it. Because he knew it better than anyone else that Li Jianheng regarded these disreputable friends of his as his real brothers.Thinking to this point, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThe reason the Empress Dowager saved you is naturally because she wants to use you. If all is calm, you can perhaps enjoy a steady rise to the top in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. But the former Emperor suddenly started resisting. The Empress Dowager\u2026 The Empress Dowager has gone looking for you, hasn\u2019t she?\u201dShen Zechuan met Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes.He must not evade it. Not even for a moment. Xiao Chiye had an extremely keen sense of smell. He only had to show a trace of guilt and Xiao Chiye could definitely tell.Shen Zechuan replied with certainty, \u201cNever.\u201dThe chilly wind brushed past them and swept up the hems of their clothes.Xiao Chiye slowly exhaled cold air and smiled unconcernedly. \u201cThen your luck is pretty good.\u201dIt was already daybreak by the time they returned to\u00a0Qudu. Xiao Chiye said from atop his horse, \u201cI have to rush over for the\u00a0morning court\u00a0session.3\u00a0You head back first.\u201dShen Zechuan nodded and watched as Xiao Chiye spurred his horse on to leave. When he returned to the abode, he did not see Chen Yang. Presumably, the latter had already left to wait for Xiao Chiye at the palace gate.Shen Zechuan took out the eastern pearl from his sleeve and held it between his fingertips to scrutinize it under the faint light. But before he could remove the strip of cloth, he paused.When he undressed, he had placed the eastern pearl into his right sleeve. But now, it was from the left sleeve he took the eastern pearl out of.Shen Zechuan clicked his tongue lightly and frowned.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xiao Chiye arrived at the palace gate, dismounted, and made his way into his family\u2019s horse carriage where he quickly changed into his official robe. Chen Yang had also prepared breakfast, and the porridge was still hot. Xiao Chiye drank a bowl.\u201cI went to the military drill grounds last night to look for you, but you weren\u2019t there.\u201d Chen Yang kneeled beside the curtain and whispered, \u201cIt isn\u2019t stable in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0these days. Someone ought to go along with you when you venture outdoors.\u201dXiao Chiye set aside the bowl and said, \u201cGet someone to keep a close watch on Shen Lanzhou at all times.\u201dChen Yang acknowledged his order and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all our own men outside the abode. As long as he ventures outdoors, he definitely will not escape your eyes. It\u2019s just that the Hua Clan has been defeated. Viceroy, what advantage is there for us to watch him closely now?\u201dXiao Chiye did not answer. He did not look too good as he lowered his eyes for a long time. It was not until Chen Yang mentioned the\u00a0morning court\u00a0session that he wiped his hands with a clean handkerchief and said, \u201cI find that man unpredictable. If you look at him now, can you tell that he knows a little martial arts?\u201dChen Yang replied, \u201cHe looks clearly weaker than he was when he joined the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. If Viceroy had not spoken of his help during the Autumn Hunt, I\u2019d definitely not be able to tell. But if Viceroy gets Zhao Hui to take a look, perhaps he might be able to catch something.\u201d\u201cZhao Hui met him face-to-face the last time he entered the capital, and he did not see anything off about him.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThat body of his\u2026\u201dHis voice stopped abruptly. After a while, he continued, \u201cSend a letter to Libei immediately and request\u00a0shifu\u2019s presence here.\u201dStunned, Chen Yang said, \u201cYou want to ask\u2026\u201d\u201cNo matter what method he used to cover it up, it will definitely not escape\u00a0shifu\u2019s eyes.\u201d Xiao Chiye twirled his thumb ring around and said apathetically, \u201cBesides, there\u2019s\u2026 something I need to speak with\u00a0shifu.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Li Jianheng shelved the\u00a0morning court\u00a0session today. He had yet to sleep his fill when he heard Shuanglu reporting to him that Hai Liangyi was kneeling just outside. Li Jianheng was immediately wide awake, but Mu Ru, who was in his arms, was still asleep. For a moment, he could not free himself, so he could only raise his neck and instruct Shuanglu in a whisper, \u201cGo! Send him away. \u201cShuanglu had only gone out for a while before he returned to kneel. He said, \u201cSecretariat Elder said he must see Your Majesty. This slave said Your Majesty is still asleep, so Secretariat Elder said he will kneel and wait for Your Majesty.\u201dLi Jianheng panicked. Mu Ru had only just woken up in his embrace when he hurriedly coaxed her, \u201cMy dear, get dressed quickly and go to Chenming Palace at the back for your meal! I have to receive and meet the Secretariat Elder!\u201dMu Ru was dainty and delicate, with black hair like a waterfall. At this moment, she did not pester him or make a commotion and simply dressed herself obediently. Once she was done, she glanced seductively at Li Jianheng with her adoring, affectionate eyes and helped him up as if the honor he had bestowed on her was too much for her to take.Li Jianheng loved this look of hers to bits. He tugged at her hand, reluctant to part, wanting so much to hold her on his knees while holding court.\u201cNext time,\u201d Li Jianheng kissed her several times in a row. \u201cNext time, I\u2019ll not ask you to retreat.\u201dHe embraced her and spoke for quite a while. It was only when Shuanglu entered again to hurry him up that Li Jianheng reluctantly let Mu Ru go.Hai Liangyi entered with a solemn expression and kowtowed.Li Jianheng sat on the dragon throne and said, \u201cPlease rise, Secretariat Elder. Please rise quickly.\u201dHai Liangyi remained in place and kowtowed again.Not getting a response, Li Jianheng looked left and right, feeling his face burning. He coughed twice and said, \u201cI\u2019ve caught a cold these two days, so I wanted to sleep in a little longer in the morning\u2026\u201dHai Liangyi said, \u201cThis old subject has heard that Your Majesty has been diligently holding night courts. It\u2019s just that there has been no responses to all the memorials that have been submitted. After giving the matter careful thought, this old subject has come to admonish Your Majesty in the face. Your Majesty is now in the prime of life and at the height of power. If Your Majesty exercises diligence in governing the state, then a bright, thriving future will be close at hand once the depressing atmosphere from before has been swept away.\u201dLi Jianheng let out a few dry laughs and said, \u201cI guess so\u2026\u201d\u201cBut Your Majesty resides deep in the inner palace surrounded by castrated traitors serving him. If I indulge Your Majesty and let Your Majesty be, then Your Majesty will over time turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to advice and stray far from current politics!\u201d Hai Liangyi said resolutely and firmly. \u201cThis subject has heard that Shuanglu, the eunuch personally serving Your Majesty, has been bribed into staffing plenty of dubious and low-down people around Your Majesty. According to the palace rules, anyone who isn\u2019t acting on imperial orders yet has the audacity to lead outsiders into the palace should be flogged to death!\u201dShuanglu fell to his knees with a \u201cthud\u201d and looked at Li Jianheng in terror. He said, \u201cYour Majesty, Your Majesty\u2026\u201d\u201cMingli Hall is a just and sacred place in this world. How can we tolerate eunuchs making a din here?\u201d Hai Liangyi looked at Li Jianheng, \u201cYour Majesty!\u201dLi Jianheng\u2019s chest was pounding hard. He looked at the stern Hai Liangyi and recalled the extreme danger of that night. His palms were sweating, and he wiped them on his dragon robe like a loser. He did not even dare to say a word in reply.The guards outside had already entered to drag Shuanglu away. Shuanglu cried out as he slid across the floor, \u201cYour Majesty, Your Majesty!\u201d\u201cHis crime\u2026\u201d Li Jianheng looked at Shuanglu. \u201cHis crime is not punishable by death\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d Hai Liangyi said firmly. \u201cPan Rugui formed an eunuch clique and colluded with Hua Siqian to stir up havoc within and outside\u00a0Qudu. It\u2019s now the time to nip it in the bud as a warning to others! Not only that, promiscuous members of the imperial harem who seduce and bewitch the Emperor in an attempt to sway him should also be flogged to death!\u201dTrembling with fear, Li Jianheng said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare, I wouldn\u2019t dare! With such a virtuous subject like Secretariat Elder to supervise and prompt me every day, how would I dare to act arbitrarily and fool around?! Secretariat Elder mustn\u2019t be taken in by those groundless rumors.\u201dBut Hai Liangyi said mercilessly, \u201cThere\u2019s no smoke without fire. Your Majesty,\u00a0 we must not allow beautiful women who are the sources of troubles4\u00a0to remain!\u201dLi Jianheng was really scared now. How could he bear to let Mu Ru die? He rose to his feet in a panic, cutting a sorry figure as he said, \u201cSecretariat Elder, I\u2019ve realized my mistakes. Shuanglu has served me for many years. Just\u2026 drop the matter today, and I\u2019ll surely administer affairs of state with due diligence in the future!\u201dHai Liangyi kowtowed, deferring to him when all had been said and done to preserve some of his dignity.Li Jianheng held on to the table and listened to the sound of flogging outside. Blow after blow, one after the other. It was as if the one being hit was himself. He looked at Hai Liangyi with mixed feelings; there was aggrievement and also fear.Xiao Chiye was just in time to see others splashing water and wiping the floor when he entered. Bloodstains spread under his feet. They were so vividly red that it was terrifying. All the eunuchs in Mingli Hall were quietly kneeling outside; not one of them dared to raise their heads.Xiao Chiye strode inside, where Li Jianheng was sitting stupefied like a piece of wood on the dragon throne. When Li Jianheng saw Xiao Chiye enter, he stared blankly at him for a moment before he burst out bawling.Li Jianheng smashed objects around as he cried and shouted, \u201cWhat kind of Emperor is this? To think someone would point a finger to my nose and humiliate me like this! Which land under the heavens isn\u2019t land of the Emperor?!5\u00a0What\u2019s wrong with me bestowing favors on a woman? Where\u2019s the wrong in it?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 : Uncle And NephewAfter Li Jianheng was done flinging stuff around, he covered his face and sobbed.Xiao Chiye avoided the shattered fragments and kneeled. When Li Jianheng\u2019s mood calmed a little after a while, he said. \u201cGet up! There\u2019s no need for you to kneel like this. You and I are buddies. Doing this will only make us feel estranged.\u201dXiao Chiye rose to his feet and said, \u201cThe Secretariat Elder is merely upright and frank by nature.\u201dLi Jianheng was in low spirits as he covered his face for a long time. He said, \u201c\u2026 They come here every two or three days to settle accounts, all of which I\u2019ve permitted. Even when money flows out like water, I\u2019ve never said a word. I\u2019ve been on tenterhooks all day long these days to the point I\u2019ve lost appetite. It hasn\u2019t been a good time for me. Can\u2019t I even ask for a few days to take a breather now that Hua Siqian is dead and Ji Lei is about to be executed? Ce\u2019an, you have no idea how dissatisfied they are with me sitting here. As long as there\u2019s another choice in this world, they would never want me.\u201dAt this point, he felt sad again.\u201cBut when have I ever thought of being the Emperor? They were the ones who pushed me into becoming one. And now they are also the ones to admonish me! The Censor of the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0keeps watching me every day. Even when I venture outdoors to appreciate flowers, they still had to submit memorials to reproach me in those erudite ways of theirs! Never mind if he killed a mere eunuch, but why can\u2019t he, Hai Renshi, show me due respect and give me some face? At the very least, I\u2019m also the Emperor of Dazhou!\u201dThe more Li Jianheng spoke, the angrier he became. But there was nothing else on the table that he could smash, thus he pounded his own thigh in indignation.\u201cHe made Mu Ru out to be a contemptible person, but it\u2019s not like they are noble and virtuous themselves! In the past when we were drinking in Donglong Street, which of them did not look dignified only for them to turn out to be scoundrels when they took off their pants?! Mu Ru was originally picked out by me from a clan with a clean background. If it weren\u2019t for that dog Xiaofuzi who got in the way, would she have fallen into that traitor Pan\u2019s hands? My heart aches so much it\u2019s going to break!\u201dXiao Chiye merely listened and said nothing as Li Jianheng gave vent to all his grievances. By the time Li Jianheng stopped his tirade, his anger had already mostly subsided.\u201cIf they truly treat me as the Emperor and respect me, then I\u2019d be willing to be diligent in my study. My Imperial Elder Brother entrusted this vast empire to me. I want to be a sovereign of a flourishing era too.\u201d Li Jianheng said with aggrievement. \u201c\u2026 Hai Renshi just doesn\u2019t think much of me.\u201dIt was only then Xiao Chiye said, \u201cOn the contrary. It was precisely because the Secretariat Elder has high hopes for Your Majesty that he dared to admonish Your Majesty so severely. Your Majesty must not bear a grudge against him. Your Majesty has to know that Secretariat Elder Hai is equally stern and exacting with that \u2018Unpolished Jade Yuanzhuo\u2019, Yao Wenyu.\u201dSkeptical, Li Jianheng asked, \u201cReally?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cIf this wasn\u2019t the case, then why would the Secretariat Elder kill Shuanglu today?\u201dLi Jianheng pondered it over for a moment, then said, \u201c\u2026 True that.\u201dIf Hai Liangyi did not think much of him, why would he keep asking his opinions on every matter?Li Jianheng recalled back to the day when he had just ascended to the throne. After Hai Liangyi learned that the Empress Dowager had sent him snacks, he had specifically instructed him in private to change all his spoons and chopsticks into silver.1Hai Liangyi was an inflexible man who conducted himself seriously in both speech and manner. But he was different from Hua Siqian. He has no disciples, only a student\u2014Yao Wenyu. As Hai Liangyi wanted to avoid rousing suspicion, Yao Wenyu had still yet to enter the government to become an official despite being so talented. Hai Liangyi had never joined any clique in the Grand Secretariat, and he was also the only one who staked all he had and charged out to save Emperor Xiande at the Nanlin Hunting Grounds.He was the lone minister2\u00a0mentioned in the books\u2014difficult ike a steep precipice, and upright like a lofty branchless tree.While Li Jianheng was thinking back on it, Xiao Chiye was thinking about it too.One thing Li Jianheng said was clear, and that was, as long there was another choice in this world, the one to ascend to the dragon throne today would not be him, Li Jianheng. But even Emperor Xiande could not do anything about it, because Li Jianheng was perhaps the one and only candidate they had in this world.Since they had given him his support, then they had to teach and guide him. Dazhou was a nation currently beset by difficulties. It might seem as if a wave of troubles had just calmed in\u00a0Qudu, but in truth, the storm had already begun to stir again.All the exceedingly loyal ministers with Hai Liangyi at the head were now all looking at Li Jianheng. In their eyes, he was perhaps a hopeless case, but Hai Liangyi had raised both of his hands to support and prop Li Jianheng up with that old back of his, wanting him to hang on, to turn over a new leaf, and to be an Emperor who would be able to leave his good name in history.Xiao Chiye and the civil officials had never gotten along with one another, because the Central Administration in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0feared the military power at the frontiers. These people were not only the reason for the invisible cage in which he was trapped, but they were also men of indomitable will and integrity in Dazhou who could still hobble on forward.Military commanders were not afraid of death, because they couldn\u2019t.Civil officials were not afraid of death, because they were conscientious.Li Jianheng was used to being fawned upon. He needed a teacher like Hai Liangyi who could castigate the contemporary failings of the times.\u201cWhen all is said and done, Lady Mu3\u00a0doesn\u2019t have a status. If Your Majesty\u2019s mind is truly set, then why not have a long heart-to-heart talk with the Secretariat Elder. This is the time when Dazhou needs a continuous line of imperial heirs. As long as Your Majesty can speak to him with honesty and sincerity, the Secretariat Elder will definitely not fob Your Majesty off.\u201d Finally, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cAs for Ji Lei and Pan Rugui, I heard that the Court of Judicial Review has yet to sentence them?\u201dAt the moment, Li Jianheng was occupied with thoughts of all that was good with Hai Liangyi. So he nodded absent-mindedly and replied, \u201cThe accounts don\u2019t tally. They still need another retrial\u2026\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8The eastern pearl was hollow. When Shen Zechuan hooked the thin fabric strip out of it, the writing on it was already smudged from the soaking. He burned away the fabric strip.Every one of Xiao Chiye\u2019s actions last night was on full display right before his eyes. Perhaps that man had touched the eastern pearl, but it was impossible for him to see what was written inside. Nevertheless, Xiao Chiye\u2019s suspicions must have been roused. Shen Zechuan had answered that question on Mount Feng wrong. Xiao Chiye had even told him the source of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0accounts, all because he was waiting for him to tell him the truth frankly. Yet, he had denied it with absolute certainty.Shen Zechuan decocted the medicine and drank it in one gulp. The bitter taste pervaded his mouth. He endured the bitterness, just like the anguish he revisited every day and night. At last, he let out a mocking smile, wiped his mouth, and lay down to sleep.He dreamed again.In the dream, the cold wind was still howling at the Chashi sinkhole. He was no longer lying at the bottom, but standing alone at the edge of the pit, overlooking those 40,000 soldiers who were struggling like ants to survive.The Biansha Cavalry surrounded the sinkhole like the black tide in the pitch-dark night. They blotted out the sky and the earth, engulfing all the Zhongbo Garrisons Troops\u2019 chances of survival, and turned this place into a slaughterhouse.A hand reached out among the churning waves of withered bones. Ji Mu stretched out his arrow-covered upper body like a puppet and sobbed as he called out to Shen Zechuan, \u201cGe hurts so much\u2026\u201dIt was as if Shen Zechuan was a statue carved in clay or wood; he could not move, nor could he shout. His breathing quickened, and he was drenched in cold sweat as he clenched his teeth tightly.The leader of the Biansha Cavalry was wearing a helmet. That hair fluttering in the wind had already turned a shade of a deep red in Shen Zechuan\u2019s recurring nightmare. He lifted his arm and pointed lightly at the sinkhole, and the arrows behind him all started falling one after another like a swarm of locusts. They stabbed into the men\u2019s bodies in dense clusters, piercing through flesh, spattering warm blood all over.The heavy snow all over the sky turned red too. Shen Zechuan watched Ji Mu fall into the bloody mud before he was swallowed up by a sticky red wave.His hands were cold. The blood on it was also cold.Shen Zechuan woke up.He sat up with his back to the light by the window as though nothing had happened. He lowered his head and went silent for a moment, then he got out of bed to get dressed.The guards lurking in the courtyard watched Shen Zechuan step out of his room to eat his meal before heading to the bathhouse.After an hour, the guard who had never taken his eyes off the bathhouse frowned and asked the man beside him. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he out yet?\u201dTwo men exchanged glances and smelled a rat at the same time. When the guards rushed into the bathhouse, all they saw was the neatly stacked clothes. Shen Zechuan was long gone.Xi Hongxuan had booked Bu\u2019er Tavern to invite others to tea. He sat until he needed to answer the call of nature, so he got up to head to the latrine. He had only just stepped out of the door and had not walked a few steps in the corridor when someone patted him from behind.Xi Hongxuan looked back and almost took a few steps back. Then he said, \u201cHow did you\u2026 Why are you always coming and going like a shadow?!\u201d\u201cA lot has been going on lately.\u201d Shen Zechuan poured cold tea in passing. \u201cThe reason Ji Lei and Pan Rugui have yet to be sentenced in the third trial by the Court of Judicial Review is because Hai Liangyi and Xue Xiuzhuo have yet to pry out whatever they wanted from those two men\u2019s mouths, am I right?\u201dXi Hongxuan glanced around, then whispered, \u201cYou want to kill Ji Lei, but what can you do with everyone\u2019s eyes on this case? The reach of Hua faction case is too widespread, and there are too many people who are afraid of being implicated by those two. It\u2019s precisely to prevent them from dying a sudden and inexplicable death that Hai Liangyi told the men to take strict precautions when standing guard. You won\u2019t be able to strike.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to.\u201d Shen Zechuan smiled derisively at Xi Hongxuan. \u201cBut I have a way to get Ji Lei to talk.\u201dXi Hongxuan looked at him for a long time. Then, he personally lifted the teapot to pour tea for him and asked, \u201c\u2026 What way?\u201dShen Zechuan sipped his tea and said, \u201cLet me see Ji Lei.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Ji Lei had been tortured for days, and at present, he was in shackles as he lay in the prison with disheveled hair and bare feet. He heard someone walking over to open the prison door, then cover his head before dragging him out.Ji Lei was shoved up a horse carriage. After a while, he was dragged down and thrown to the ground. It was quiet all around, with only the sound of water dripping off the corners of the walls.Ji Lei crawled up from the ground and asked with a black fabric bag covering his head, \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dA water droplet splashed with a \u201cplop\u201d. No one responded.Ji Lei felt a chill on his back. Bracing himself with his arms, he probed tentatively, \u201c\u2026 Secretariat Elder Hai?\u201dBut still, no one answered.Ji Lei\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple throbbed. He shuffled forward on his knees and bumped into the bars. He fumbled around, steadied himself, and shouted, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t Secretariat Elder Hai, then you are Xue Xiuzhuo! How are you planning to torture me today? Bring it on!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Say something. Why aren\u2019t you saying something?!\u201d\u201cWho are you? Who exactly are you? What do you want to do\u2026 Do you think I\u2019d be afraid if you don\u2019t talk? I\u2019m not afraid\u2026 I\u2019m not afraid!\u201dJi Lei bent his head down between his arms to scrape the bag off. He moved his eyes and saw Shen Zechuan sitting in a chair right in front of him.Shen Zechuan was all dressed in bluish-white, with one hand on the chair\u2019s armrest as he propped his head up to stare expressionlessly at Ji Lei.Laughter escaped from Ji Lei\u2019s throat. He grabbed the bars and squeezed his face in between the bars, then said in a low and deep voice, \u201cOh, it\u2019s you\u2026 the stray dog of Zhongbo. What does the vile beast want from your\u00a0shishu? Revenge for Ji Gang, or revenge for yourself?\u201dShen Zechuan said nothing. The smile vanished from those tender, expressive eyes of his, leaving only a heavy and dark gaze behind.Ji Lei could not even find hatred in them. He felt as if that was not a man with flesh and blood sitting there, but a famished stray cur that had already started to feed on human flesh.Ji Lei lowered his eyes and said with hatred, \u201cThe Ji Clan has no descendants, and the one who severed Ji Gang\u2019s bloodline is you. So what are you looking at me for? Shen Zechuan, it was your Shen Clan who killed Ji Mu, and it was also your Shen Clan who violated Hua Pingting. How do you face yourself having lived for so long? You are the devil beneath the tens of thousands of ghosts who died unjustly. You are the continuation of Shen Wei\u2019s ignoble existence. You deserve to be hacked to pieces\u2026\u201dJi Lei began to laugh softly. He looked demented.\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll be afraid of you? The bastard whom nobody wants. You think taking off your pants to follow Xiao the Second will give you better days ahead? Haha!\u201dShen Zechuan laughed too.Ji Lei\u2019s laughter gradually came to a stop. He said coldly, \u201cIs that funny? My plight today will also be your predicament in the future. \u201cShen Zechuan put down his leg and leaned against the chair like he was pondering it over. He said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m so scared.\u201dHis words were breezy with sarcasm the moment he opened his mouth.\u201cDevil, bastard, stray dog, vile beast.\u201d Shen Zechuan rose to his feet and crouched outside the bars. He began to laugh at Ji Lei, and said in an insane yet restrained tone, \u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m all of them. I\u2019m the devil who climbed my way out of the Chashi sinkhole, the bastard Shen Wei left behind after he burned himself to death, the stray dog without a home to return to, and the vile beast reviled by thousands.\u00a0Shishu, I\u2019m so delighted you know me so well.\u201dJi Lei began to tremble uncontrollably.Shen Zechuan looked askance at him. His gaze was far more sinister and malicious than how it was back then. It was as if a man had already died under this layer of gorgeous skin, and all that survived was an unnamed beast.\u201cFive years ago,\u201d Shen Zechuan drew closer to the bars and scrutinized Ji Lei\u2019s fearful expression. He said softly, \u201cThe one kneeling here was me. What was that you said to me the day you sent me into Zhao Zui Temple?\u201dJi Lei\u2019s throat and eyes tensed. He wanted to answer, but he could not voice it out.\u201cI have been remembering everyone\u2019s kindness with gratitude.\u201d Shen Zechuan said piously. \u201cEvery day. Every night.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 : Interrogation\u201cYou\u2026 What exactly are you\u2026\u201d Ji Lei pressed himself against the bars, looked at Shen Zechuan\u2019s smile, and swiftly moved back. \u201cWhat exactly are you up to?!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re asking me?\u201d Shen Zechuan said cheerfully. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me, huh?\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s gaze turned malicious as he beckoned haughtily to Ji Lei. Ji Lei did not move. He leaned back against the wall and refused to budge even a fraction closer to Shen Zechuan.Shen Zechuan said, \u201cPrisoners are all livestock waiting to be slaughtered.\u00a0Shishu, how dare you ask me?\u201dJi Lei countered, \u201cWhat else can you do? Kill me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not often us uncle and nephew get the chance to meet. There\u2019s not even enough time for us to play, so how could I kill you so quickly?\u201d Shen Zechuan slid his thumb across the bars and softened his tone. \u201cYou aren\u2019t saying a word because you feel that it\u2019s something you can exploit. With those secrets in your hands, no one would bear to lay their hands on you. Your days in prison become more comfortable, and you don\u2019t have to worry about food and clothing, nor fear for your life. There\u2019s Pan Rugui to accompany you, and you have plenty of leisure time. How carefree and happy.\u201dJi Lei broke out in cold sweat. He stuck to the wall, no longer looking into Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes.\u201cBut happy days are all fleeting. As long as the tongue is still there, it\u2019s not a big deal if a leg is missing, an arm is broken, or both eyes are gouged out. A few months ago,\u00a0shishu\u00a0treated me to donkey roast. I didn\u2019t get to taste it at that time. But now that the night is long, it\u2019s a good time to dine with wine.\u201d Shen Zechuan slipped the thin blade out between his fingers and tapped it between the bars. He said, \u201cJi Lei, time to serve you up to go with my wine.\u201d\u201cYou. Are. Insane!\u201d Ji Lei stretched his neck out and enunciated each word, \u201cShen Zechuan, you\u2019re insane!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m insane.\u201d Shen Zechuan stared at him and answered in the affirmative.\u201cHow would you dare to lay a hand on me?\u2019 Ji Lei said furiously, \u201cYour life is in the Empress Dowager\u2019s hands. How would you dare to even touch a strand of my hair?!\u201dShen Zechuan cheered up again and said with a smile, \u201cShishu, why do you always have to keep saying such hilarious words tonight? Who else do you think sent me here?\u201dEnraged, Ji Lei said, \u201cDon\u2019t even think of hoodwinking\u2014\u201d\u201cShen Wei is dead.\u201d Shen Zechuan quickly cut off Ji Lei\u2019s words. \u201cThe day Shen Wei set himself on fire, I heard that the Prince of Jianxing Manor in Dunzhou was ablaze in raging flames. He was burned beyond recognition when the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0dragged him out of the ruins and hung him atop Dunzhou city walls to be reviled by all. I didn\u2019t see that scene with my own eyes, but I kept attempting to imagine it over the years. After turning it over in my mind, I finally realized something.\u201dJi Lei swallowed his saliva.\u201cHis grand plan to collude with the enemy has succeeded. Isn\u2019t defecting right before the battle much better for him? Duanzhou had already fallen into the enemy\u2019s hands. If he led his troops forth to receive and welcome them, he could join the Biansha Cavalry and hurry to take down\u00a0Qudu\u00a0before the Libei Armored Cavalry crossed the River of Ice. However, he was so scared that he recoiled from advancing and only dared to retreat.\u201d Shen Zechuan stood up. \u201cHe had already succeeded. It\u2019s only by advancing that he would have a chance to survive. But he kept withdrawing. Even if he was a good-for-nothing, he should have known that retreating would only lead him to his doom.\u201dJi Lei\u2019s breathing intensified as he said in loathing, \u201cBecause he didn\u2019t dare. Who in the Biansha Twelve Tribes would give him a damn? He was already a dead man the moment he colluded with the enemy!\u201dShen Zechuan threw an eastern pearl into the cage, and the tumbling pearl knocked into the edge of the cage and rolled its way to Ji Lei\u2019s feet. Shen Zechuan scrutinized Ji Lei\u2019s face as the color gradually drained from it. He smiled.Ji Lei\u2019s hands trembled. He stared at that eastern pearl and said with difficulty, \u201cNo\u2026 Impossible\u2026\u201d\u201cEmperor Xiande is dead.\u201d Shen Zechuan leaned over and said, \u201cSo is Shen Wei.\u201dJi Lei suddenly kicked away the eastern pearl and said, \u201cCunning lad, don\u2019t even think of tricking me!\u201dShen Zechuan said happily, \u201cHua Siqian has committed suicide by biting off his tongue. Who will be the next one? You, or Pan Rugui? Shall we draw lots?\u00a0Shishu, you first.\u201dWith that, he spun out two more thin blades between his fingers and presented them before Ji Lei through the gap.\u201cIf it\u2019s chipped, we\u2019ll kill Pan Rugui. If it isn\u2019t, then we\u2019ll feed all of your flesh and blood to the dogs. Don\u2019t be afraid. Draw one.\u201dJi Lei looked at the cold glint of the thin blade. His lips opened and closed. He said, \u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Empress Dowager instructed me to be quick.\u201d Shen Zechuan stared at him. \u201cYet I gave you the opportunity to choose.\u00a0Shishu, there\u2019s a chance for things to turn for the better for each\u00a0 day you live.\u201dJi Lei was already in a daze having been tortured for days. And now, under this bizarre atmosphere, Shen Zechuan\u2019s words confused him until he could not tell the truth from lies. He fixed his eyes on those two thin blades. Finally, and curiously enough, he raised his hand. When his trembling fingers touched the thin blade, he saw Shen Zechuan slowly lifting the corners of his lips.\u201cOh.\u201d Shen Zechuan smiled regrettably. \u201cI forgot that the blades I\u2019ve brought along today are all new blades. The chipped ones have already been disposed of.\u201dThe shame of being played instantly overwhelmed Ji Lei. Losing control of himself, he threw himself forward and shouted hysterically as he yanked at the bars, \u201cDo it if you want to kill me or cut me to pieces! I\u2019ll not say a word of what you want to know! Kill me, kill me!\u201d\u201cWrong.\u201d Shen Zechuan remained in firm control of the atmosphere. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who wants to kill you.\u201d\u201cYou are!\u201d Ji Lei dug his fingers into the bars. \u201cYou are!\u201d\u201cAm I?\u201d Shen Zechuan gently nudged over the eastern pearl that had rolled out and stepped on it. He looked at him coldly and asked again, \u201cAm I?\u201dJi Lei held his head and tore at his unkempt hair. He slid down the bars to his knees and repeated over and over again. \u201cYou are\u2026 You are the one\u2026\u201dShen Zechuan suddenly said, \u201cShen Wei killed the Crown Prince.\u201dJi Lei raised his head to look at him in terror, as if he had plunged into an ice cave. He said, \u201cYou\u2026\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cYou and Shen Wei killed the Crown Prince.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me!\u201d Ji Lei clutched at his hair. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me! The one who killed the Crown Prince was Shen Wei!\u201d\u201cYou conspired with him to frame the Crown Prince for plotting a rebellion.\u201d Shen Zechuan said quickly, \u201cYou were the one who forged the document. You forced the Crown Prince into Zhao Zui Temple. He wanted to see Emperor Guangcheng, but you drew your blade and killed him.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me!\u201d Ji Lei had already gone crazy. He refuted vehemently in the face of Shen Zechuan\u2019s chaotic interrogation. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the one who drew the blade! It was Shen Wei. It was Shen Wei who insisted on killing him!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why Shen Wei is dead.\u201d Shen Zechuan circled back and repeated, \u201cShen Wei set himself on fire and was burned beyond recognition. You are the only one left now.\u201dThis succession of insinuations pushed Ji Lei into such a corner that all he could think of was the word \u201cdeath\u201d. He thought back clearly to the former Crown Prince\u2019s face when he was killed. At that time, he had stood in the spot where Shen Zechuan was now standing and looked down at the Crown Prince from above as if he was looking at swine. Now, by some act of ingenuity, his position had been reversed. The cage gave him the misconception that he was akin to a beast. He had become the ant1\u00a0under Shen Zechuan\u2019s foot. All he could do was to crane his neck out and wait to be slaughtered.2Ji Lei did not want to die.His desire to survive had never been so strong. He banged his forehead against the bars and said, \u201cWe are all just following orders. We had no choice! You want to avenge Shen Wei? I can help you! Shen Wei killed the Crown Prince and was conferred the title of Prince of Jianxing. He subsequently went to Zhongbo. He fled!\u201dJi Lei cut a sorry figure as he started to choke with sobs. He had no idea where this fear came from either. It was as if he had really turned into a livestock at the mercy of others. All he could do was to raise his head and look at Shen Zechuan.\u201cI didn\u2019t kill the Crown Prince; I wanted to save him! But Father suddenly died.\u201d Ji Lei said helplessly, \u201cFather died, and they want to frame me for it! If I took the rap for it, Eldest Brother would kill me, and so would Ji Gang! What could I do? I could only beg Pan Rugui for help! If Pan Rugui were to protect me, then I had to forge the documents! I was forced into that situation. I wanted to live too!\u201d\u201cHow did Ji Wufan die?\u201d Shen Zechuan asked out of the blue.\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how Father died\u2026 Father fell ill, because Ji Gang left. The sons he favored had all left.\u201d At this point, Ji Lei turned malevolent again. He hated them so much. \u201cI was the one who was with him in his last moments and the one who conducted funeral rites for him! Yet he said my core was rotten. He regarded Ji Gang and Zuo Qianqiu as his own sons and passed the mental cultivation techniques to both of them. But my surname is Ji too, and I didn\u2019t even do anything. So how could he treat me in such a way?!\u201d\u201cShen Wei couldn\u2019t sleep at night after killing the Crown Prince. He was afraid. When we were drinking, he told me that he had gradually come to sense someone watching him. In his residence, he could even hear someone moving on the roof in the middle of the night. I told him it wasn\u2019t the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. But in this\u00a0Qudu, is there anything that could hide from the eyes of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards? I presumed there were traitors in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards; Men from the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0were everywhere.\u201d\u201cThe Hua Clan was already in power, so we were careful. But Shen Wei\u2019s insomnia worsened. He wanted to flee. Thus, he bribed Pan Rugui with a lot of money, hoping to leave\u00a0Qudu. At that time, Libei was a rising force to be reckoned with. The Empress Dowager had no other military forces other than the Eight Great Training Divisions. In order to guard against the Xiao Clan, Shen Wei was conferred the title of the Prince of Jianxing. He went to Zhongbo, a large prefecture where the only routes between Qidong and Libei, and Libei and\u00a0Qudu, would pass through. The Empress Dowager wanted him to be her watchdog with his eyes on Libei and Qidong.\u201dJi Lei spoke more and more urgently.\u201cWho would have expected Shen Wei to collude with the enemy? He was asking for death! He had the documents with his correspondences with\u00a0Qudu. Once the documents fell into Libei Armored Cavalry\u2019s hands, Xiao Jiming would not miss the opportunity to deal\u00a0Qudu\u00a0a heavy blow! So Shen Wei had to burn himself to death! Do you understand now? Shen Wei colluded with the enemy. He was no longer willing to be under the control of others. Back then, the Hua Clan had a son of common birth. Going by the Empress Dowager\u2019s intent, once this child of common birth grew up, outsiders would no longer be needed to keep an eye on Zhongbo. Shen Wei had committed so many evil deeds in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0for the Hua Clan. If Zhongbo no longer needed him, then he would be but a useless chess piece3\u00a0of the Empress Dowager.\u201d\u201cNo one anticipated him to take desperate measures after being driven into a corner and let the Biansha Cavalry in to massacre the cities\u2026 This was vengeance! This was his revenge on\u00a0Qudu, on the Empress Dowager, and on Dazhou! \u201cJi Lei grasped the bars and pleaded. \u201cI\u2019ve said all I have to say\u2026 The Empress Dowager was the one who forced Shen Wei to his death. She was also the one who forced the Crown Prince to his death. And Emperor Guangcheng, Emperor Xiande, Hua Siqian\u2026 they were all the Empress Dowager\u2019s sacrificial chess pieces!4\u00a0And now you are carrying out jobs for the Empress Dowager. Look at me. I didn\u2019t tell her that you have already thrown in your lot with the Xiao Clan\u2026 You saved Xiao Chiye that night, didn\u2019t you? But the Xiao Clan will not help you. As long as Xiao Chiye is in\u00a0Qudu, the Xiao Clan cannot make their move. They can hardly look after themselves, so how would they care about you?!\u201dHe wanted to prove his usefulness, but his fear kept intensifying. His crumbling line of defense left him utterly defeated. The more inferior he felt, the more scared he became.Shen Zechuan asked him his last question through the bars. \u201cFive years ago, my\u00a0shiniang\u00a0died when Duanzhou fell into the enemy\u2019s hands. No one knows about this matter, so how are you so clear about it?\u201dJi Lei looked at the expression in Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes. In that dead silence, a drop of sweat slowly trickled down.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xi Hongxuan waited until he fell asleep. It was not until a stack of paper was thrown onto his body that he jolted awake. He took the papers and shook it open for a look in the dark and saw the vividly red fingerprints at the bottom. He let out an obscure laugh and said, \u201cYou sure are good.\u201dThere was a slight saltish stench on Shen Zechuan\u2019s body. He smiled for a moment, then said, \u201cWhether or not this confession can be submitted to the top depends on how Secretariat Elder Hai views it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s some great favor you did.\u201d Xi Hongxuan said, \u201cSurely you didn\u2019t help for nothing?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a man named Qiao Tianya in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. He\u2019s good with the broadsword. I want him.\u201d Shen Zechuan said calmly.\u201c\u2026 Not a problem.\u201d Xi Hongxuan hesitated for a while. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Yanqing.\u201d\u201cThank you for the trouble.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cIt\u2019s late now. I should go.\u201dWith that, he opened the door and took his leave.It was raining in the night outside. Xi Hongxuan wanted to call out to Shen Zechuan to get onto the horse carriage so that they could leave together. But then he had a thought and changed his mind. He flipped through the confession to look through it once, feeling that it had all gone too smoothly.As Xi Hongxuan was thinking that he had to show Xue Xiuzhuo this confession first, he said to the attendant at the side, \u201cGo. Drag Ji Lei out and send him back.\u201dThe attendant acknowledged his order and went to open the door. He had only just strode in when he fell to the ground on his butt with a loud clatter and screamed as though he had seen a ghost.Xi Hongxuan followed the opened door and saw Ji Lei. His stomach churned, and he covered his face to retreat, desperately knocking aside the table and chairs as he dashed into the rain to throw up violently.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan washed his hands until they reddened before he wiped them with a handkerchief. There were no bloodstains on his white outfit, but there was the lingering stench of blood. He picked up the front of his clothes and frowned as he sniffed it.What a stink.Shen Zechuan squatted under the rain by the edge of the water. Very quickly, the night rain drenched him. He slowly raised his head and gazed at the pitch-black sky until his neck was sore. Then, he rose to his feet and walked back.When Shen Zechuan reached the alley of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s residence, he saw a man standing at the entrance.Xiao Chiye was leaning against the door in the dark with folded arms, staring at him like a cheetah.At some point, snow had begun to fall with the rain, making one feel damp and cold to the bone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 : First SnowThe chill was bitingly cold as the wind blew at their sleeves.Right at this time, Shen Zechuan suddenly turned his head and sneezed, dispelling the confrontation that was on the verge of erupting. He was soaking wet as he waved his hand at Xiao Chiye and said in a muffled voice, \u201cHave a handkerchief?\u201dXiao Chiye strode a step forward and handed him one.The tip of Shen Zechuan\u2019s nose had been frozen red; even his fingertips were red. He took the blue handkerchief and covered his mouth and nose.It was only then Xiao Chiye unhurriedly opened up the umbrella. Without making way for Shen Zechuan, he asked, \u201cWhere did you go?\u201dShen Zechuan replied, \u201cTo play.\u201d\u201cIn any case, you\u2019re my guard. You have to inform the office when you head out to play.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cIt\u2019s really worrying if you run off without so much a word.\u201d\u201cI left my waist token in the bathhouse. Did the Second Young Master not see it?\u201d Shen Zechuan sniffed the scent on the handkerchief. It smelled rather good\u2014not the usual incense customarily used by the nobles, but more like the surging waves of strong, valiant wind under the scorching sun. It was the scent on Xiao Chiye.What a nice smell.Shen Zechuan lowered his eyes, almost fascinated by this scent. This was the sunlight beyond his reach; the spirit he no longer possessed in this life. A part of him did not want to return the handkerchief, thus he raised the corners of his eye to glance at Xiao Chiye out of the corners of his eyes, looking as if he had something to say but was hesitant to.\u201cNope, didn\u2019t see it.\u201d Xiao Chiye felt around his chest but did not touch the object he was looking for. He turned his eyes just in time to see Shen Zechuan\u2019s gaze on him. Taken aback, he said, \u201cWhat conscienceless deed have you done for you to look at me in such a way?\u201d\u201cWho knows?\u201d Shen Zechuan said a little smugly to him. \u201cI\u2019ve done plenty.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hear a couple.\u201d Xiao Chiye said.\u201cA heart-to-heart talk in the night should be done inside the house. It\u2019s rather cold to be standing here.\u201d Shen Zechuan coughed and said, \u201cIs the bathhouse still open?\u201d\u201cClosed.\u201d Xiao Chiye replied. \u201cYou can only go to my room if you want to take a bath. Your health is so bad. Should I call for a physician to take a look for you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d Shen Zechuan countered his move. \u201cWith the Second Young Master stepping in, I\u2019ll get to save on consultation fees.\u201d\u201cYou have yet to recover from a major illness, and running around all over only makes it even more worrying. I\u2019ll get someone to follow you in the future.\u201d Xiao Chiye chivalrously made way for him. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Second Young Master will hold up the umbrella for you and send you there.\u201dShen Zechuan looked at Xiao Chiye\u2019s shoulder, which was even taller than his own self, then looked at him again. He smiled and said, \u201cI can stand on tiptoe to hold up the umbrella too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid of veils.\u201d1\u00a0Xiao Chiye\u2019s side profile was tasteful, with a straight nose and a nice silhouette. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re too short.\u201dShen Zechuan strode through the main entrance with him and said, \u201cYou\u2019re really the one who\u2019s too tall.\u201d\u201cWhen I was young, I was a few heads shorter than my\u00a0dage, and with such a name to boot. It made me anxious, so I trained hard in martial arts every day and made it a habit to drink milk before going to bed.\u201d Xiao Chiye strode over the puddle of water with his long legs and continued, \u201cWho would have expected my height to shoot through the roof when I was thirteen or fourteen?\u201d\u201cAin\u2019t that great?\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cMy\u00a0dage\u00a0was very tall too.\u201dThe rain receded, but the snow intensified.Xiao Chiye raised the brim of the umbrella to gaze at the snow and said, \u201cIt\u2019s yet another year.\u201dShen Zechuan gazed at the snow too and echoed. \u201cYet another year.\u201d\u201cThe new Emperor ascended to the throne and granted amnesty to all.\u201d Xiao Chiye paused. \u201cThe Empress Dowager\u2019s power and influence have weakened. You can leave\u00a0Qudu\u00a0and go anywhere you want.\u201d\u201cThen conceal my name to live incognito, forget my past, and remain a mediocre person for my entire lifetime.\u201d Shen Zechuan said mildly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something a man who hates me should say.\u201d\u201cI hate the Biansha Cavalry,\u201d Xiao Chiye said coldly, \u201cI hate Shen Wei too.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cYou should hate me.\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s eyes stirred.Shen Zechuan continued, \u201cI\u2019m a man who lives on hatred.\u201dSnowflakes fell upon the stone slabs and melted in a twinkling of an eye.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThe current you understand those words from five years ago best.\u201d\u201cLiving is much more painful than dying.\u201d Shen Zechuan suddenly laughed. He exhaled and said to Xiao Chye, \u201cThat\u2019s not right. I\u2019m not in pain. Hatred itself is death by dismemberment; it\u2019s like a knife gouging out your flesh. Day after day. Anyone would eventually become numb. There\u2019s nothing else in this world that can make me feel \u2018pain\u2019 again. I feel comfortable living like this. You\u2019ve repeatedly advised me to drop the matter, but you yourself understand it best that \u2018stopping\u2019 has never been something you and I have the luxury of choosing. If warmth and tenderness can make you feel better, then I don\u2019t mind playing on for longer.\u201dShen Zechuan raised his hand as he spoke and drew that icy finger across Xiao Chiye\u2019s sturdy back. He said in what seemed to be a whisper.\u201cThere are some things that are vividly beautiful when seen through the mist; but when you take a closer look, they are just a pile of dead men\u2019s bones.\u201d2Xiao Chiye waited for him to retract his hand before shaking his umbrella impatiently. He said, \u201cDead men\u2019s bones won\u2019t touch people like this.\u201dShen Zechuan smiled and was just about to stride forward when Xiao Chiye grasped him around the shoulder.\u201cYou sure have guts\u2026\u201d Xiao Chiye wrapped his arm tightly around his shoulder, \u201c\u2026 to touch your Second Young Master while you are reeking so heavily of blood. Over ten men in the courtyard can\u2019t even keep an eye on you, so what room are you returning to? Just sleep with me.\u201dShen Zechuan was caught off-guard. Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThe favor you did me by saving my life has always been on my mind, and I\u2019ve repeatedly given you chances. Yet you just have to treat me like some kind of fool to coax. Is it that delightful to keep teasing me? If so, then why aren\u2019t you smiling? Shen Lanzhou, come on, didn\u2019t you say you don\u2019t mind playing on for longer?\u201dAs soon as he said that, he tossed away the umbrella, strode a step over, and simply hoisted Shen Zechuan over his shoulder.A wave of dizziness washed over Shen Zechuan with his head dangling down. He immediately covered his nose and mouth with the handkerchief and fumed, \u201cXiao\u2019Er\u2014\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cIf you dare to move, then I\u2019ll dare to turn\u00a0Qudu\u00a0upside down immediately to see who\u2019s the one who collaborated with you from the inside and outside to kill someone in the middle of the night.\u201d\u201cGo investigate then!\u201d The moment Shen Zechuan opened his mouth, Xiao Chiye gave him a jerk so hard that he almost threw up.\u201cLook at how fast you flee when there\u2019s a hole in the bathhouse for you to dig your way through.\u201d With Shen Zechuan over his shoulder, Xiao Chiye leaped over the railing and passed through the courtyard with withering greenery. He swiftly made his way through the moon gate3\u00a0and headed right for his own room.The sprawling man shadowing them on the rooftop poked his head out for a look and clicked his tongue in wonder. \u201cHe was still smiling and chatting in the snow earlier, looking all courteous and refined. Why the sudden urgency?\u201d\u201cThat guy doesn\u2019t want to be with Second Young Master, okay?\u201d The guard who was always watching Shen Zechuan took a gulp of his\u00a0shaojiu\u00a0wine4\u00a0and continued, \u201cHe fled so fast yesterday likely because he was afraid the Second Young Master would force himself on him tonight. I went to the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0to ask around this afternoon. Everyone all knows about this matter.\u201d\u201cDo we report this to the\u00a0Hereditary Prince?\u201d The one who had poked out his head to look around fished out a little book, licked his brush, and pondered over it. \u201cUgh, this isn\u2019t going to be easy to write.\u201d\u201cHe carried him into the room so brazenly.\u201d The one drinking wine took a few glances. Xiao Chiye had already kicked the door close with a \u201cbang\u201d. He thought for a moment, then said, \u201cOr let\u2019s just not\u2026 Being a homo5\u00a0can\u2019t be said to be a major issue, but it isn\u2019t a minor one either. It\u2019d be tough to explain to both sides if we say it wrong. The Second Young Master will get a beating.\u201dThe other one frowned and drew a few strokes, then said, \u201cWell\u2026 then I\u2019ll just record it but not report it yet. If the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0comes to settle scores later, we\u2019ll just say we buckled under the Second Young Master\u2019s abuse of power6\u00a0and did not dare to report it without grounds.\u201d\u201cBut how on earth did he escape?\u201d The one drinking wine pillowed his head on his arms, still unable to fathom it.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8There was a heater in the room. Xiao Chye did not release Shen Zechuan, but looped an arm around his waist as he circled around the room to rummage through his clothing chest.\u201cThere\u2019s more than enough hot water. Feel free to pick the fragrances7\u00a0and bath beans8\u00a0as you like.\u201d As Xiao Chiye spoke, he turned his head aside to sniff openly at Shen Zechuan\u2019s waist. He said, \u201cYou are not the kind of person who needs to bathe in milk and flower petals and pearl powder,9\u00a0are you?\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cPut\u2026 I\u2019m going to puke!\u201d\u201cThen puke the way you are now.\u201d Xiao Chiye took out the clothes stowed away at the bottom of the chest and closed the chest. Ignoring the mess of clothes dangling out through the closed gap, he took Shen Zechuan further inside.He lifted the hanging screen. There were two small sections of space separated by a screen inside. One side led to hot water, while the other side was a clothes rack. Xiao Chiye hung the attire up on the rack and easily shifted the screen away with one arm. Then he placed Shen Zechuan by the edge of the pool and dragged a chair over with his leg.\u201cTake your bath.\u201d Xiao Chiye sat without inhibitions and raised his chin at Shen Zechuan. \u201cEverything you need is all prepared. I\u2019ll see how you run.\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s face turned white as he asked in astonishment. \u201cYou watching?\u201dXiao Chiye stretched out his long legs and folded his arms. He said, \u201cYou shy? Don\u2019t run, okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid the one who\u2019s shy isn\u2019t me.\u201d Shen Zechuan retorted sarcastically.\u201cThen, go ahead and strip.\u201d Xiao Chiye was calm and unruffled. \u201cLet\u2019s see which of us throw in the towel first.\u201dWithout saying another word, Shen Zechuan pulled his waist belt open. Xiao Chiye looked right at him without the slightest intent to avert his eyes. By the time Shen Zechuan stripped to his inner garment,10\u00a0his knuckles had already turned white.\u201cWhether you are in pain or not, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Xiao Chiye teased him. \u201cBut from the looks of it, you\u2019re pretty angry.\u201dHe had not even finished his words when Shen Zechuan\u2019s clothes were tossed onto his face.Xiao Chiye grabbed the clothes and smiled for a moment. By the time he removed them from his face, Shen Zechuan had already entered the water.Shen Zechuan leaned over on the other side without turning or looking back. Water droplets condensed on that fair and smooth back of his; it was so silky and moist it looked like jade petals with dew.Xiao Chiye sat for a moment, then said, \u201cWhat a short temper. Don\u2019t you always have a way with your words in the past?\u201dShen Zechuan said,\u00a0 \u201cNot as\u00a0hardcore as the Second Young Master.\u201d11Never mind if he used such a double entendre for the first time. But after saying it several times, whatever bit of bashfulness Xiao Chiye had was all but snuffed out by him.So, he remained firmly seated and answered with composure, \u201cOf course.\u201dAfter a moment, Xiao Chiye probed, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell me where you went to play tonight?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re omnipotent.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cGo check it out yourself.\u201d\u201cThere are a few places where you can get to kill people at this time.\u201d Xiao Chiye took the eastern pearl out of Shen Zechuan\u2019s clothes and pinched it between his fingertips to size it up. He said, \u201cThe Empress Dowager is still rich. Things are already at such a stage and she still has to put on such an ostentatious display when sending secret messages. You couldn\u2019t have been dazzled silly by this pearl and set your heart on being her lackey because of it, could you?\u201d\u201cWho doesn\u2019t love money?\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cEven though His Majesty favors you and trusts you now, you still have to make up for the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s equipment shortfall. You know better than me the benefits of having money.\u201d\u201cShe told you to kill someone.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cAnd you simply went to kill?\u201dShen Zechuan had already soaked enough and reached a hand out for his clothes. But Xiao Chiye used his leg to hook the clothes rack away. He got up and said, \u201cAnswer me.\u201dBare-chested, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cLiar.\u201d Xiao Chiye stretched out his hand to take down the clean clothes and said to Shen Zechuan, \u201cThis pearl had been soaked rotten that night. How could you have been able to see the Empress Dowager\u2019s instructions clearly? The person you killed tonight is someone you wanted to kill, am I right?\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201c\u2026 Uh-huh.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t uh-huh me.\u201d Xiao Chiye caressed the fabric. \u201cAn ambiguous answer is equivalent to no answer.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s someone I want to kill.\u201d Shen Zechuan reached out a hand. \u201cYou got it right.\u201d\u201cJi Lei?\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cOr Pan Rugui?\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s fingertips had already reached the clothes. He said, \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be you?\u201dThere was a swish as the clothing was lifted high. Refusing to give it to him, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cJust an exchange of a few words and you\u2019ve changed your tone. Second Young Master doesn\u2019t buy sarcasm. Whether you kill Ji Lei or Pan Rugui, the Court of Judicial Review will definitely not let the matter drop tomorrow morning. You saved my life during the Autumn Hunt. The Empress Dowager doesn\u2019t know about this yet, but I can let her know. Once she finds out, you\u2019ll be my man even if you aren\u2019t now. So speak properly and don\u2019t tease your Second Young Master for fun.\u201dEach time Shen Zechuan attempted to reach for the clothes, Xiao Chiye would raise it high. Shen Zechuan put up with it again and again until he finally rose from the water to grab the clothes. He fumed, \u201cSpeak properly, while I\u2019m naked?!\u201dXiao Chiye leaned in for a closer look and said, \u201cSee, this is what I mean by speaking properly. Why put on an enigmatic dead men\u2019s bones\u2019 act before me? Ghost stories can\u2019t scare me.\u201dHaving said that, he paused for a moment.\u201cSince you\u2019ve touched me, I\u2019d have to touch back. We aren\u2019t on that good of a term for me to be nonchalant about it. So, where do I touch?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 : ScentShen Zechuan suddenly imitated Xiao Chiye\u2019s action from the last time and splashed water droplets onto his face, then seized the chance to grab the clothes from his hand.Unable to open his eyes from the spray of water, Xiao Chiye reached out an arm to pull off a dry towel. He covered it over Shen Zechuan\u2019s head and rubbed it at random. Shen Zechuan was still putting on his clothes, and Xiao Chiye\u2019s rubs sent half of his body swaying. Seething with hate, he used his bare leg to kick out at the latter\u2019s chair.With the chair under Xiao Chiye\u2019s butt pushed back from the kick, Xiao Chiye immediately stretched out his legs, clamped them around Shen Zechuan tightly, and forcibly dragged the latter towards him. Then he continued to rub Shen Zechuan\u2019s head as if he was wiping down a puppy.\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll do as I please!\u201d Xiao Chiye snapped.\u201cAs you\u2026 you\u2026 son of\u2026 \u2018Er!\u201d The towel rubs caused Shen Zechuan\u2019s voice to break up intermittently.Xiao Chiye pulled off the towel. Without saying another word, he pinched Shen Zechuan\u2019s chin with one hand, while his other hand slid down along Shen Zechuan\u2019s nape to his waist and hips.\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cDid you call me a son of a bitch?\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s waist belt was not properly secured, and the outfit on his body was Xiao Chiye\u2019s old clothes. Thus, it hung loosely on his body, exposing his collarbones. The water droplets on his body wetted Xiao Chiye\u2019s fingertips as the latter moved his hand down, blending into one with that satiny touch.\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d Shen Zechuan backhandedly pressed down on Xiao Chiye\u2019s hand to hold it in place. \u201cAs they say, one should reflect daily on three aspects.1\u00a0Second Young Master, you should really do some reflection.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s nimble fingers turned over to grasp Shen Zechuan\u2019s hand instead. \u201cThe first word I knew of was \u2018son of a bitch\u2019. I\u2019ve long told you that your Second Young Master is a jerk. There\u2019s absolutely no need for me to reflect. And isn\u2019t this waist of yours too slender?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you who have touched too little.\u201d Shen Zechuan said callously.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Xiao Chiye pretended not to understand and wandered into another direction. \u201cI naturally haven\u2019t touched your waist that many times.\u201dShen Zechuan had no wish to put on a show with him any longer. He tightened his waist belt with one hand and said, \u201cSince you have touched me back, then this matter is closed.\u201dXiao Chiye released his legs that were wrapped around Shen Zechuan, and Shen Zechuan fastened his waist belt. Even his face had turned red from the rubs Xiao Chiye was giving him with a handkerchief.Feeling hot, Xiao Chiye rose to pick up the eastern pearl on the ground and happened to see Shen Zechuan\u2019s bare legs again. It dazed him for a moment, then he swiftly straightened up and took two steps back before pressing in another two steps. He said, \u201cSleep.\u201dShen Zechuan poured a bowl of hot ginger soup. After rinsing his mouth, he sneezed again.Xiao Chiye found the way he looked when he sneezed amusing, just like a cat\u2026 He soaked the handkerchief with cold water and wiped his face.\u201cDon\u2019t go that way.\u201d Xiao Chiye undressed and pointed to his bed. \u201cYou sleep in my bed.\u201dShen Zechuan wiped his mouth and said, \u201cThen I won\u2019t stand on ceremony.\u201dHe dispensed with the formalities and sat on Xiao Chiye\u2019s bed.Xiao Chiye shifted the tables and chairs away, and then dragged the\u00a0xumi\u00a0couch2\u00a0in the room to the vacated spot about the distance of a stepping block away from Shen Zechuan. He rolled over to lie down, then pillowed his head on both arms and said, \u201cLan Zhou, extinguish the lamp.\u201dShen Zechuan blew the lamp out and lifted his blanket to lie down with his back facing Xiao Chiye.It was still snowing outside, but the inside of the room was warm and quiet.Xiao Chiye shut his eyes, looking as if he was sleeping. The sensation of touching Shen Zechuan lingered on his fingertips, and it was becoming more and more vivid at this time in the darkness. Xiao Chiye opened his eyes to stare at the roof and began to think about the skies in Libei.It\u2019s only when one is without desires that one can become a sage.When his\u00a0shifu\u00a0taught him to hold the bow, it happened to be the season when the pastures of Libei were luxuriant. He had sat on the fence at the edge of the horse ranch and looked up at the azure blue sky with his head propped up with his hands.Zuo Qianqiu had asked, \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201dHanging around Xiao Chiye\u2019s neck was the bone thumb ring. He swung his calves and said, \u201cI want an eagle.\u00a0Shifu, I want to fly.\u201dZuo Qianqiu sat on one side and looked at him. He patted the back of his head and said, \u201cYou are also a lad burning with desires. But in this world, it\u2019s only when one is without desires that one can become a sage. There are many matters that will end up being your cage once you harbor the desire for it.\u201dRestless, Xiao Chiye grasped hold of the railing with both hands and swiftly hung upside down from it, his little robe covering his face in turfs of grass and dust. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s only human nature to want.\u201d\u201cWanting is the prelude to joy and misery.\u201d Zuo Qianqiu carried his own great bow in his arms and wiped it carefully. \u201cIf you acknowledge that you are but a mortal with desires, then you will be swayed by considerations of gain and loss. If you want it, you must get it. You will be a little wolf with such a character. But A-Ye, there will be many things in the future that you want, but will never get. What should you do then?\u201dXiao Chiye landed on the grass. He grabbed at the hem of his robe and caught hold of a big locust. He pinched the struggling locust and said half-heartedly, \u201cFather said, where there is a will, there is a way; there is nothing that can\u2019t be obtained.\u201dZuo Qianqiu sighed, thinking he was still too young after all. So he helplessly pointed to the sky and said, \u201cAlright. You want to fly, but can you really fly?\u201dXiao Chiye released the locust and raised his head to look at Zuo Qianqiu. He said in all seriousness, \u201cI can learn how to tame eagles. Once I tamed one, then its wings will belong to me. The sky it flies past will be the sky I fly past.\u00a0Shifu, a man has to be adaptable.\u201dZuo Qianqiu looked at him for a long time before he said, \u201cYou are stronger than me\u2026 I\u2019m a fool who can\u2019t adapt to circumstances.\u201dImitating an eagle, Xiao Chiye spread his arms open and ran a few steps on the grass in the wind. He said, \u201cI want to tame a horse too.\u201d\u201cEagles and horses are both strong-willed creatures.\u201d Zuo Qianqiu followed after him and said, \u201cLooks like our A-Ye likes people who are recalcitrant and hard to tame.\u201d\u201cTaming.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of process I like.\u201dXiao Chiye thought.It was not that he liked such a process. He enjoyed it. He was fascinated by it. It was just like torturing an eagle.3\u00a0He would not let the eagle sleep for seven days, and not feed it for four. He would hang it until the feathers on the top of its head puffed up, and torture it until its \u201ceyes were comparable to that of sesame seeds.\u201d Only when it obeyed his orders that he could take it out for hunting.And now, 'sexual desire\u201d was his newly acquired eagle.Xiao Chiye tilted his head slightly and looked at Shen Zechuan\u2019s back. That slanted clothes revealed Shen Zechuan\u2019s nape. In the darkness, it was like a piece of unpolished jade that felt wonderful to the touch.Xiao Chiye was hard again.CANG JI LOVES LIANYIN @ CANGJI.NETHe did not move, nor did he look away. He did not believe that this kind of shallow lust could dominate him. He did not believe that he would succumb to this kind of crass instinct.Before dawn the next day, both men sat up in unison as if they finally have had enough of it.The guard who had been sprawling on the roof all night huffed out a breath of hot air and watched as the maidservants entered the room in a single file. He said, \u201cHuh, nothing happened last night.\u201dThe one drinking wine said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t succeed.\u201dThe one holding the brush asked suspiciously, \u201cAnd you know that how?\u201dThe one drinking wine shifted his body and watched as Shen Zechuan stepped out of the door. He said, \u201cLook at him. He\u2019s moving as per normal today. Other than the black circles under his eyes, he clearly looked rested.\u201dBoth men systematically turned their heads as their eyes followed Shen Zechuan. Then they looked back at Xiao Chiye, who had just stepped out.The one holding the brush said, \u201c\u2026 Second Young Master doesn\u2019t look too happy.\u201dThe one drinking wine said, \u201cHe\u2019s sex-deprived.\u201dChen Yang draped a coat around Xiao Chiye. Seeing his grave expression, he said, \u201cViceroy, did he screw something up?\u201dXiao Chiye replied, \u201cUh-huh. You could say so.\u201dAlarmed, Chen Yang said, \u201cLast night, he\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s pretty proficient in feigning sleep.\u201d Xiao Chiye secured\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0and braved the snow to descend the stairs. \u201cLet\u2019s go. To the military drill grounds at Mount Feng.\u201dChen Yang chased up to him and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no one on duty today. And it\u2019s snowing. Viceroy\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye flipped atop the horse and lowered his voice, \u201cI\u2019m going to see the new equipment that has just arrived. Tell Gu Jin and Ding Tao to keep an eye on him.\u201dChen Yang nodded.Xiao Chiye raised his head and shouted to the two men on the roof. \u201cIf you lose him again, both of you can scram too.The two heads that had popped out from the rooftop gave a uniform nod and shrank back again.Ding Tao put the brush and book properly back in his bosom and said, \u201cThis is just great. We have turned from Second Young Master\u2019s guards into his guards.\u201dGu Jin shook what was left of his wine and said, \u201cI feel that he can fight eight men on his own. We\u2019ll just keep an eye on him.\u201d\u201cJust keep an eye on him.\u201d Ding Tao readied himself, then placed both hands mannerly on his knees. After sitting for a while, he said, \u201cBut, where is he?\u201dBoth men looked at each other, then rose at the same time and said, \u201cShit!\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Eating his steamed bun, Shen Zechuan opened the back door to Zhao Zui Temple.Ji Gang was shadowboxing in the courtyard. When he saw him coming, he wiped his sweat with a towel and asked, \u201cWhy are you here today?\u201dShen Zechuan replied, \u201cI\u2019ll be busy in a few days. It\u2019s convenient today.\u201dGrand Mentor Qi was sleeping among a stack of papers. His snores boomed like thunder, so Shen Zechuan and Ji Gang did not enter the house but sat under the eaves to chat.Wiping his face, Ji Gang asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t use your martial arts lately, did you?\u201dShen Zechuan lifted his sleeve up to reveal the bruises, courtesy of the sparring with Xiao Chiye the day before. He said, \u201cI fought once with\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er.\u201dJi Gang was stunned, then he flew into a rage. \u201cHe actually dared to hit you?!\u201d\u201cMy guess is that he wants to see my internal martial arts.\u201d4\u00a0Shen Zechuan put down his sleeve and said, \u201cShifu, he\u2019s truly blessed by Heaven. His physique is a notch better than the Prince of Libei. I countered his blows with the Ji Clan\u2019s Boxing Style, but it was just like an ant trying to shake a tree.5\u00a0I couldn\u2019t move him at all.\u201d\u201cBack then, Zuo Qianqiu left the capital to head to Suotian Pass, where he met Suotian Pass\u2019s Feng Yisheng.\u201d Ji Gang said, \u201cFeng Yisheng took in Zuo Qianqiu as his adopted son and imparted the Feng Clan\u2019s Art of Broadsword to him. By the time it was imparted down to Xiao the Second, it has probably already become a skill that incorporates a blend of martial arts from various schools, thus differing from us. But the Ji Clan\u2019s style naturally has the Ji Clan\u2019s strengths. If you can truly have a match with him on broadsword techniques alone, then you will be able to compare the differences.\u201d\u201cLangli Blade\u00a0was forged by a famous craftsman on Commander-in-chief Qi\u2019s payroll. It slices through metal like cutting through mud. Common blades are useless when facing up against it.\u201d Shen Zechuan said thoughtfully.\u201cThe blades forged by the Qi Clan\u2019s craftsmen are all \u2018General\u2019s Broadsword\u2019, specially designed for combat on the battlefield. Look at Xiao the Second\u2019s\u00a0Langli Blade; if it can make an appearance on the battlefield, it would be able to split human bones with one straight slash. It was entirely made to fit the arm\u2019s strength of that lad.\u201d As Ji Gang spoke, he stamped the snow off his shoes. \u201cAs for us, we might not necessarily get used to wielding it even if we have the chance to. But you don\u2019t have to worry about your blade.\u00a0Shifu\u00a0has already found one for you.\u201d\u201cMy blade?\u201d Shen Zechuan was slightly taken aback.\u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0is a good place.\u201d Ji Gang smiled at him. \u201cThe amount of time you\u2019ve been there is still short, but you will slowly come to understand in the future that it\u2019s a place full of hidden talents in Dazhou. She, Qi Zhuyin, may have a famous craftsman, but we have no lack of them in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0either. I keep thinking of that blade of Ji Lei. Once\u00a0shifu\u00a0brings you that blade and hands it to an old friend to reforge, it will be no less inferior to Xiao the Second\u2019s\u00a0Langli Blade!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t Ji Lei\u2019s blade Xiuchun Blade?\u201d6\u201cXiuchun Blade is the blade he generally carries along with him, but he also has my father\u2019s blade hidden in his collection.\u201d Ji Gang said with a snort. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he dead yet? Once the Court of Judicial Review sentences him, that blade will be sealed into the armory. As long as it is in there,\u00a0Shifu\u00a0will have a way.\u201d\u201cHe has been tortured for such a long time,\u201d Shen Zechuan said softly. \u201cHe won\u2019t be able to endure it for much longer.\u201d\u201cDid you find the person I asked you to find before the Autumn Hunt?\u201d Ji Gang remembered this matter and hastened to ask.\u201cI\u2019ve found him.\u201d Shen Zechuan smiled. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for him to come out.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xiao Chiye did not return even during dinnertime, so Shen Zechuan rested in his own room. It was in the middle of the night when he heard hurried footsteps outside. Following right after, someone knocked on his door.Shen Zechuan wanted to pretend that he did not hear it when he heard a sound at the window. Xiao Chiye raised the window with his sheath and whistled at him.Meng landed on the edge of the window and tilted its head to look inside too.\u201cWe agreed to sleep together,\u201d Xiao Chiye was not pleased. \u201cWhy did you run back here again?\u201dCANG JI LOVES LIANYIN @ CANGJI.NETShen Zechuan threw a pillow out of the window, and Xiao Chiye caught hold of it. So Shen Zechuan could only get up and hugged his blanket to open the door.Carrying his pillow in his arms, Xiao Chiye suddenly took a sniff and asked, \u201cDid you put on some fragrance?\u201dShen Zechuan replied, \u201cI apply ten catty7\u00a0of rouge a day.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Xiao Chiye smiled and said.Shen Zechuan walked in front. With Xiao Chiye standing behind him, even the night wind could not blow onto Shen Zechuan. Sensing a coolness on his nape, Shen Zechuan swiftly looked back.Xiao Chiye scraped him with a finger, then sniffed his own finger a little dubiously.\u201cWhat is this scent on your body?\u201d Xiao Chiye wondered, \u201cA whiff\u2026\u201dShen Zechuan swung the blanket over Xiao Chiye\u2019s head and replied calmly, \u201cThat\u2019s the smell of gunpowder on your own body.\u201dXiao Chiye stood for a brief moment, then lifted the edge of the blanket with lightning speed and enveloped Shen Zechuan within it too.With his head protruding from the eaves, Ding Tao speedily fished out a small book and exclaimed in excitement, \u201cWay to go, Second Young Master! You caught him!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 : BlunderbussThe world darkened before Shen Zechuan; he was now much closer to Xiao Chiye. He heard Xiao Chiye say, \u201cSo it\u2019s really the smell on me. This is way too pungent.\u201dShen Zechuan switched the topic and asked, \u201cDid you just add the blunderbuss1\u00a0to the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s arsenal?\u201d\u201cBronze blunderbuss.\u201d Xiao Chiye moved his finger closed to the tip of Shen Zechuan\u2019s nose to let him take a sniff. \u201cIt was mixed together with the scent on you, so I couldn\u2019t tell it apart for a moment.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no scent on me.\u201d The tip of Shen Zechuan\u2019s nose twitched slightly. He said, \u201cDid you raid the Eighth Great Training Divisions\u2019 military armory?\u201dThe blunderbuss was restricted by the imperial court. After it was improved from the original bamboo tube design into the bronze version, it became the equipment of the Eight Great Training Divisions\u2019 Chunquan Battalion. This weapon was lethal, but it was not easy to control. The projectiles had limited range, and it took time to load. However, the Eight Great Training Divisions\u2019 job was to guard\u00a0Qudu, and it was mostly street fights when they came to blows with others. Not only was it hard to bring out the firearm\u2019s full potential to do what it was meant to do, but it also became a burden. That was why the Eight Great Training Divisions did not popularize the use of it and chose to set it aside instead. It was only during the yearly drills at the military drill grounds that they would take it out to use.It might not suit the Eight Great Training Divisions, but it was very suitable for Libei\u2019s Armored Cavalry. The Armored Cavalry of Libei were heavy cavalry, with a very small number of infantry and light cavalry.2\u00a0They favored straight-on assault that hit like a surge of monstrous wave. In the early years, Dazhou set up a cavalry garrison at Luoxia Pass. In order to deal with the fast speed of the Biansha Cavalry, they spared no expense to purchase horses and attempted to build Dazhou\u2019s very own cavalry\u2019s horse ranch. However, all the horses sent by the Biansha Tribes were often inferior steeds in their own tribes, while their own horses were true brave horses who had fought against packs of wild wolves at the foot of the Hongyan mountains. Paired up with machetes and sturdy warriors, they were invincible everywhere they went.It was because of this that Xiao Fangxu established the Libei Armored Cavalry with heavily armored men and horses. They formed a living metal wall in the northwest so that there was no way the Biansha Cavalry\u2019s storm-like assaults could pass through this steel wall.The northwest was a vast, boundless expanse of grassland. If the Libei Armored Cavalry could be equipped with blunderbusses, then the long-ranged attacks of the Biansha Cavalry would turn into Libei\u2019s Armored Cavalry\u2019s advantage. Long-ranged attacks could leave enough time for the blunderbusses to be charged. By the time the cavalry arrived before them, they would be within the shooting range of the blunderbusses.To Libei, this simply served to boost their power and strength, much like a tiger that had been given wings.\u201cEven with Xi Gu\u2019an removed, the Eight Great Training Divisions are still the Eight Great Training Divisions.\u201d Xiao Chiye took a step closer and pushed Shen Zechuan forward with his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s no raiding to talk of for a military armory. It\u2019s just a change of master. Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m only just taking it to play with.\u201dShen Zechuan walked a few steps as if he really did not care and said, \u201cCan you just lift the blanket away and walk?\u201d\u201cThe days are short, and the nights are long. Why not hold a candle for a leisure walk?\u201d3\u00a0Xiao Chiye smiled. \u201cWant to play with me too?\u201d\u201cSince it was not obtained in an open and above-board manner, then it\u2019d be safer to hide it.\u201d Shen Zechuan lifted the blanket and made his way out. \u201cMaking your way through\u00a0Qudu\u00a0while reeking of gunpowder all over. You\u2019re lucky it\u2019s the middle of the night.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter even if it\u2019s during the day.\u201d Xiao Chiye clamped the pillow under his arm and raised one arm high to prop up the blanket as he walked. He swept his eyes across the veranda\u2019s eaves. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t know that I, Xiao Ce\u2019an, love to play? Even if I hold a blunderbuss, it\u2019s also to shoot\u00a0birds.\u201dHe emphasized the word \u201cbirds\u201d, causing Ding Tao and Gu Jin, who were sprawled above, to shudder in unison.After entering the room, Xiao Chiye threw the blanket and pillow onto his bed, kicked off his boots in two or three tries, and stepped across the woolen rug with the intent to take a bath. He had already taken off half of his clothes when he extended his upper body out from behind the curtain.\u201cHave you taken your bath?\u201dShen Zechuan rinsed his mouth and said, \u201cYeah.\u201dSo Xiao Chiye took a bath himself, moving fast. When he stepped out while wiping the water on his nape, he saw that Shen Zechuan had already lain down with his back towards him. Xiao Chiye looked at the nape Shen Zechuan had covered up tightly, then wiped his hair hastily and blew out the lamp.CANG JI LOVES LIANYIN @ CANGJI.NETShen Zechuan listened as Xiao Chiye sat on the couch and opened a box to look for something.\u201cLanzhou.\u201d Xiao Chiye closed the box and asked, \u201cAre you asleep?\u201dShen Zechuan answered without feelings. \u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cThe Court of Judicial Review summoned many physicians today. Yet they did not dare to alert the Imperial Academy of Medicine.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cWhat did you do to Ji Lei?\u201dShen Zechuan asked, \u201cDo you want to listen to ghost stories late at night?\u201d\u201cThey are going to interrogate the\u00a0Imperial Prison\u00a0guards tomorrow morning.\u201d Xiao Chiye said.Just going through the motions.Shen Zechuan did not know whether Hai Liangyi could tolerate such a thing, but he knew Xue Xiuzhuo could. Xue Xiuzhuo had already gotten the confession he wanted, so Ji Lei was now useless. This mess was created by Shen Zechuan, but never once had he thought to clean up the mess, because Xue Xiuzhuo and Xi Hongxuan\u00a0had\u00a0to clean it up.When Shen Zechuan thought to this point, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been toeing the line. Even if they investigate\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye lay down, then suddenly sat up and said, \u201cWipe my hair.\u201dShen Zechuan closed his eyes and pretended to sleep.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cStop pretending to sleep. Hurry up.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cLanzhou.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cShen Lanzhou.\u201dThe bed suddenly sank. Shen Zechuan opened his eyes in shock. His blanket had already been lifted away. Xiao Chiye squeezed in behind him and nuzzled his dripping wet head on Shen Zechuan\u2019s back, instantly soaking it.Pulling his blanket, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cXiao\u2019Er, you a three years old?!\u201d\u201cMore or less.\u201d Xiao Chiye replied lazily, \u201cDidn\u2019t you already fall asleep? Please continue.\u201dThe more Shen Zechuan slept, the wetter he became. That cold mop of hair stuck to him. And following in its wake was Xiao Chiye, who smelled the same as the scent on the handkerchief last night.Shen Zechuan opened his eyes and said, \u201cMy clothes are wet.\u201dNo one replied.Shen Zechuan said, \u201cStop pretending to sleep.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cXiao\u2019Er.\u201dShen Zechuan propped himself up with his arms and said in the darkness, \u201cXiao Ce\u2019 an, you\u2019re a jerk.\u201dThe jerk handed him a dry handkerchief out of consideration, then turned his back to him and waited.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8On the rooftop, Ding Tao pulled back his hands and said, \u201cIt\u2019s so cold even on snowy days. I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be having an easy time this winter.\u201dGu Jin handed him the wine bag4\u00a0and rubbed his hands and said, \u201cWe have kept watch for two nights. There should be a shift change tomorrow morning.\u201dDing Tao took a sip of the wine, which warmed him up a little. Folding his arms up into his sleeves, he lay down too and said as he looked at the night sky, \u201cNothing\u2019s happening tonight either.\u201d\u201cThe task is arduous, and the road is long.\u201d Gu Jin covered the wine bag. His ears suddenly twitched, and he turned over to lie on his stomach. His eyes moved back and forth in the boundless darkness like a falcon.A subtle sound of snow being trodden on rang out in the wind. Gu Jin acted decisively and flipped over his hand to toss out a flying blade. He whispered, \u201cThe northwest corner!\u201dDing Tao suddenly leaped up, flew across the rooftop, and hacked at the darkness with a lightning move of his hand.The jet-black robe in the night dodged his blow smoothly. Like a ghost, the man concealed himself into the shadows and attempted to flee. A lithe Ding Tao fell over to hang upside down from the eaves. He did not expect steel needles to come for him right in the face. Using the shaft of the brush in his hand, he struck away the needles with a \u201cthwack\u201d. When he took a look again, the person had already made his escape.Ding Tao landed soundlessly on the ground. His\u00a0qinggong\u00a0was so outstanding that he did not leave any footprints when he landed on this thin snow.Gu Jin surveyed the area from the rooftop and said, \u201cExcellent martial arts. To think he could escape my eyes. Tao-zi,5\u00a0could you tell who it was?\u201dDing Tao picked the steel needles from the veranda and pinched them between his fingertips to scrutinize. In just a short instant, he had already learned a lot. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s thin as hair and dipped in snake venom. It\u2019s not a product of\u00a0Qudu, but a foreign gimmick imported by the Yongquan Harbor in the Thirteen Cities of Juexi. His\u00a0qinggong\u00a0is good, and his ability to mask his breathing is exceptional. Although he did not carry a broadsword with him, he\u2019s likely from the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards.\u201dHe carefully put the steel needles into his own bamboo tube and somersaulted back on to the rooftop.\u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0have removed a bunch of officials from office. Skilled men of fourth grade6\u00a0and below are few and far between.\u201d Gu Jin said, \u201cWho would come to our Prince\u2019s Manor at this moment to scout around?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say.\u201d Ding Tao touched his chest with trepidation. \u201cHe almost stabbed my book.\u201dGu Jin drank his wine, lost in thoughts.Ding Tao sat cross-legged and began to say in a hushed tone, \u201cThis book has been with me for many years. What\u2019s more, it was a reward from the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u2019s Consort. Even when I went to fight those Biansha baldies, it had never been stabbed before. What a close call. It\u2019s really too close of a call. There are still many things written in it. Do you know? My father\u2019s own book was stolen when someone slit his throat. Oh my god. Recorded in it are all major stuff. Back then, I chased after the book until I almost died. Jin-ge, I\u2019m telling you. A man should always keep a journal because they will become forgetful when they grow old. Like you. You drink so much wine all day that before the age of forty, you will probably forget how much money you have been squirreling away. Why not you tell me, and I\u2019ll write it down and remember it for you\u2026\u201dGu Jin stuffed cotton into his ears and began to meditate.The next day, Shen Zechuan was the first to wake up.He did not sleep. With Xiao Chiye crowding behind him, both of them had been up to their neck pulling the blanket back and forth in the night. Besides, Shen Zechuan could not sleep with such a hulk of a person beside him.Xiao Chiye was lying still in a pretty sound sleep while hugging the pillow.Shen Zechuan waited for him to wake. But he ended up waiting for something else instead.That erected portion pressed against his buttocks. Brimming with vigor. Hot and obvious. The temperature on the bed rose. He did not know if Xiao Chiye was awoken by the heat or by the hardness. In any case, he cussed in a hoarse voice and sat up in one smooth movement.CANG JI LOVES LIANYIN @ CANGJI.NETXiao Chiye tossed the pillow aside. He cast Shen Zechuan a look and saw that Shen Zechuan was also looking at him. He grabbed at his own hair and reached out a hand to cover Shen Zechuan with the blanket to forbid the latter to look. Then he got out of bed and headed straight into the pool without even wearing his shoes.Chen Yang was waiting outside listening to signs of activities when he saw Shen Zechuan stepped out. He did not know what to say as both men faced each other. But Shen Zechuan simply pointed naturally in the direction of the bath hall and walked away.By the time Xiao Chiye emerged, he was already clear-headed. He ate a little of his breakfast and listened as Chen Yang told him about the intruder last night.\u201cImperial Bodyguards?\u201d Xiao Chiye thought for a moment and said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t come for me. He should be someone here to keep an eye on Shen Lanzhou.\u201d\u201cThen, he\u2019s the Empress Dowager\u2019s man.\u201d Chen Yang said, \u201cBut manpower is scarce now. How would there still be such skilled men in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards?\u201d\u201cThe waters of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0run deep..\u201d Xiao Chiye stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll head out for\u00a0morning court.7\u00a0We\u2019ll talk again when I return.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8At the end of the court session, Li Jianheng, holding the hand warmer,8\u00a0sat in Mingli Hall and watched as the various officials split up into both sides. He asked apprehensively, \u201c\u2026 So the verdict has been passed?\u201dXue Xiuzhuo kneeled and said, \u201cTo reply Your Majesty, Ji Lei had made a full confession regarding his intent to rebel at the Nanlin Hunting Grounds. The evidence against him is now conclusive. The Court of Judicial Review worked through the night last night to straighten out the confession, and it has been submitted to Your Majesty by Secretariat Elder Hai. In the half-months before and after the Hua Faction case, the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices\u00a0have repeatedly conducted joint trials. The two vice Commanders and four Assistant Commanders of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0headed by Ji Lei are all sentenced to immediate execution by decapitation,9\u00a0while the Judge10\u00a0and accompanying Battalion Commanders at the Nanlin Hunting Grounds are all sentenced to prison to await execution.\u201d11\u201cAs long as the sentence has been passed, it\u2019s all good.\u201d Li Jianheng said. \u201cYou have worked hard, Secretariat Elder. It\u2019s inadvisable to stand for long. Men, bring him a seat.\u201dAfter Hai Liangyi sat down, Li Jianheng continued, \u201cIt\u2019s truly abhorrent of the Hua Clan to collude with the eunuchs and\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0to plot a rebellion! Pan Rugui, as the Brush-holding Director of the\u00a0Directorate of Ceremonial, is greedy for power and wealth. He\u2019s wicked beyond redemption. This person must not be held in custody to await execution; he should be beheaded right away! The words Secretariat Elder has previously said to me gave me sleepless nights. After thinking about it for a long time, I\u2019ve decided to work hard for the prosperity of the state from now on.\u201dHai Liangyi immediately rose to bow again.Li Jianheng quickly raised his hands and said, \u201cSit, Secretariat Elder, please sit. There are now many matters that I\u2019ll need the Secretariat Elder\u2019s advice on. In the future, I hope that everyone will work as one to assist me. If you have something to say, you can boldly speak your mind here.\u201dXue Xiuzhuo looked up in surprise, but his expression remained neutral. He kneeled in unison with the various officials on his left and right and commended the decision.Li Jianheng excitedly motioned for everyone to get up. After saying a little more, he dismissed them and invited only Secretariat Elder Hai to stay and have a meal with him.Xiao Chiye happened to be with Xue Xiuzhuo when he came out.Xue Xiuzhuo said, \u201cI wonder what the Viceroy said to His Majesty. To think His Majesty would be willing to show such respect to the wise.\u201d\u201cHis Majesty is young and strong. This is just the time for him to show his might. Even if I said nothing, he would still do this on his own accord.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThe Court of Judicial Review has been busy these days. It has been hard on Your Excellency Yanqing.\u201d\u201cOne would naturally concern himself with all matters pertaining to his post; it\u2019s my duty.\u201d As Xue Xiuzhuo spoke, he looked at Xiao Chiye and said with a smile, \u201cI heard that the Viceroy has been diligently heading to Mount Feng these two days. Is there anything fun there?\u201dXiao Chiye smiled too and replied, \u201cThe first snow on Mount Feng is unparalleled in the world, and several deers have been sighted recently. I\u2019m thinking of hunting a few rounds for fun. If you are free, would you like to go and have a look together?\u201dXue Xiuzhuo gave a light wave of his hand and said, \u201cI am just a weak scholar. What would I know about hunting? I wouldn\u2019t want to dampen the Viceroy\u2019s spirits.\u201dBoth men parted ways at the entrance of the palace. As Xiao Chiye watched him recede into the distance, his earlier smile waned.Chen Yang was waiting by the horse carriage. He waited until Xiao Chiye arrived before he lifted the curtain for him and said at the same time, \u201cViceroy, the venerable\u00a0shifu\u00a0has already left for\u00a0Qudu.\u201dXiao Chiye nodded.Chen Yang hesitated for a moment, then continued, \u201cOur tail in the Court of Judicial Review has brought back word that Ji Lei\u2019s dead.\u201dXiao Chiye asked, \u201cHow did he die?\u201dChen Yang raised his hands to gesture as he kept his voice down to say, \u201cHe was skinned until he looked neither human nor ghost. He was on the verge of dying last night, but Xue Xiuzhuo kept him hanging onto his last breath until the confession was presented to His Majesty. Only then did he let him breathe his last.\u201dXiao Chiye sat down in silence.Chen Yang said, \u201cJi Lei interrogated Shen Zechuan in the\u00a0Imperial Prison\u00a0five years ago, and got Fengquan to humiliate him in public with \u2018donkey roast\u2019. Now, Shen Zechuan has returned tit for tat and also turned Ji Lei into\u2026 This person\u2019s vindictive nature is evident. Viceroy, there\u2019s animosity between him and us too. It\u2019s too dangerous to let him stay with us now.\u201dXiao Chiye twirled the thumb ring on his thumb and did not reply.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 : Military DisciplineThe snow fell for three or four days. Xiao Chiye became lazy to the point he hardly went to the military drill grounds. He had recently made the acquaintance of several Longyou merchants1\u00a0and purchased some valuables such as pearls imported from Yongquan Harbor and jasper produced from Hezhou, all of which were exquisite items.Li Jianheng was very diligent now. No matter how cold the weather was, he would attend court sessions as usual and ask Hai Liangyi to give lectures every day. When he saw Xiao Chiye neglecting his tasks, he would also exhort him a word or two. He seemed as if he genuinely had a change of heart.Xiao Chiye was glad to see the change in him. He hunted two deers from Mount Feng and presented them to the palace. Frightened by the donkey roast the last time, Li Jianheng kept wild creatures at arm\u2019s length and bestowed the deers to Hai Liangyi instead.It was soon to be the end of the year, when the sacrificial ceremony2\u00a0and officials\u2019 banquet were major events. The Six Ministries and\u00a0Twenty-four Yamen\u00a0of the Imperial Palace were all up to their neck in work. The\u00a0Directorate of Ceremonial\u00a0lacked manpower, and there were many matters that they could not get a grasp on, so they still had to ask Li Jianheng. Li Jianheng was baffled when it came to these matters too, so he had to trouble Hai Liangyi and the Ministry of Rites to decide every time.It began to grow busy in\u00a0Qudu. When Li Jianheng saw that Xiao Chiye had nothing to do, he gave him an important job and handed him the task of reviewing the Eighth Great Training Divisions\u2019 roster. This way,\u00a0Qudu\u2019s patrols and defenses fell completely into Xiao Chiye\u2019s hands.Xiao Chiye could not turn it down, so he had no choice but to start busying around.Shen Zechuan followed Xiao Chiye as the latter bustled about. Consequently, that made it inevitable for him to run into the\u00a0Imperial Army.Tantai Hu had yet to remove his blades after his patrol ended this one day. When he returned to the office, he saw Shen Zechuan standing outside. He rubbed his frozen, scarred face and strode over.Shen Zechuan turned his head and watched as Tantai Hu moved menacingly towards him.\u201cShen the Eighth?\u201d Tantai Hu stopped in his tracks and said coldly to Shen Zechuan. \u201cShen Wei is your old man, right?\u201dCANG JI LOVES LIANYIN @ CANGJI.NETShen Zechuan asked, \u201cAre you looking for my old man or for me?\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019m looking for you. Shen Wei has already been fucking burned to ashes.\u201d Tantai Hu paced around Shen Zechuan and said, \u201cYour days in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0are still comfortable. Look at this figure. It\u2019s comparable to the courtesans in Donglong Street. The pampered kind with an appetite for food and wine.\u201dHearing his tone, Shen Zechuan knew that he did not come with good intentions. Chen Yang said nothing beside him, while the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0in the courtyard all craned their necks to watch the show.Tantai Hu continued, \u201cPerky ass and a slender willow waist. Rosy peach blossom cheeks and foxy eyes. In Xiangyun Villa, you\u2019d be a first-class top courtesan material. Why are you running around in the wind and snow with our Viceroy instead of living the good life?\u201dTantai Hu stood fixed in place and stared daggers at Shen Zechuan. He continued, \u201cIt was only because Shen Wei licked the hooves of the Libei Armored Cavalry horses five years ago that the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo did not turn into manure pits for the Biansha Twelve Tribes\u2019 horses. And now you are also learning from your old man. Which part of our Viceroy are you going to lick? The brothel prostitutes are all great talents skilled in a certain technique once they let down the bed curtains. What skill do you have that makes you worthy of standing together today with all the men who have fought battles?\u201dShen Zechuan said with a smile, \u201cIf I\u2019m not worthy, then is the Vice Commander going to revoke my waist token and drive me out of the courtyard?\u201d\u201cWhy would I want to waste that much effort?\u201d Tantai Hu said, \u201cYou are the dog at our\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s doors. Even a kick is an honor to you. It\u2019s also on account of the Viceroy that I\u2019m here saying a few words to you. Since you have become another man\u2019s \u2018thing\u2019, then you must have the cognizance of being an object.\u201d\u201cI hung up the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0waist token on the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u2019s3\u00a0orders. And that means I\u2019m here on official business. How is that being someone else\u2019s \u2018thing\u2019?\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cIf I\u2019m the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s dog, then all of you sirs aren\u2019t that different either. We are all men receiving a salary from the imperial court walking around\u00a0Qudu. If there is any awareness to be had, then everyone must work with one mind and heart to be enlightened.\u201dTantai Hu\u2019s tiger-like eyes widened in a stare as he held up his twin blades and fumed, \u201cYou, the same as us? Disrespectful Shen dog! Back then, I was the Senior Battalion Commander of the Dengzhou Garrison Troops of Zhongdu.\u201d He strode a sudden step forward and seethed with hatred. \u201cAt that time, when Chashi River was defeated, my brothers were in the Chashi sinkhole! Do you know what a sight that was? Men shot alive with arrows until they turned into hedgehogs! Forty thousand men buried together in the sinkhole! Forty thousand men!\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s expression remained unchanged.Tantai Hu said, \u201cMy old man and mother were in Dengzhou too. The Biansha Cavalry came attacking, and that traitor Shen fled, abandoning all the old, weak, women, and children in Dengzhou like my parents to the Biansha Cavalry! They massacred the cities one after another. My younger sister was dragged by the Biansha Cavalry for two\u00a0li4\u00a0before she was raped and slaughtered at the city gates! But you are living such a carefree life with no need to worry about the necessities! Just stick out your ass for others to fuck, and any sin you are guilty of can be pardoned!\u201dThe cold wind blew in the courtyard. Chen Yang saw that the situation was getting out of hand and wanted to stop him, but it was already too late.Tantai Hu lifted Shen Zechuan by the collar and said, infuriated, \u201cHow dare you talk back when I\u2019m lecturing you today? You are all young masters used to a life of luxury. How would you know exactly how many people died in that battle? How would you know there are still countless people who have starved to death in Zhongbo even in this day and age?! How\u2019s life in\u00a0Qudu, huh? You sleep well, live well, and there are always people absolving you of sin one after another. Then what about those people in Zhongbo who have died? Who is going to be held accountable for their deaths?!\u201dShen Zechuan grabbed hold of Tantai Hu\u2019s arm and suddenly flung him over to the ground. It was such a shocking move that everyone around them retreated in unison.Shen Zechuan rubbed two handfuls of snow and looked at Tantai Hu. He said, \u201cWho? Ask your own people. It took an entire month for the Biansha Cavalry to enter our territory and moved along the banks of Chashi River to Dengzhou. When Shen Wei cowered back from battle, you iron-willed, valiant men should have broken his neck and dispatched troops to fortify defenses.\u201dShen Zechuan stood up.\u201cEven if you humiliate me and hate me, it\u2019s no skin off my nose. This world calls for repaying a debt of blood with blood. Killing me is thus considered enforcing justice on behalf of heaven and appeasing public wrath.\u201d He spat at Tantai Hu and smiled maliciously. \u201cWhat a fucking load of crap. The one who massacred the cities is the Biansha Cavalry. They are also the one who killed those forty thousands soldiers. You want to screw me, Shen Zechuan, then get your ass straight first and wash the Biansha Cavalry\u2019s piss off your head. My life is lowly, and my death is not to be regretted. But will my death write off the Biansha Cavalry\u2019s debts?\u201dTantai Hu said, \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking try to absolve yourself from guilt! Wasn\u2019t your old man the one who let the Biansha Cavalry into the territories?!\u201d\u201cThen kill me.\u201d Shen Zechuan raised a finger to make a slashing motion across his neck. \u201cPlease, hurry and kill me. Kill me, and the Shen traitor\u2019s bloodline will be severed.\u201dTantai Hu suddenly stood up, pulled out his twin blades, and pounced on Shen Zechuan.Having just woken up, Ding Tao had only just strode through the door when he saw what was happening. Alarmed, he shouted, \u201cLaohu,5\u00a0don\u2019t hurt him! I have to keep watch on him!\u201dTantai Hu was already beyond listening. He slashed out with his twin blades and sent the wind whistling. Ding Tao leaped three feet6\u00a0high, intending to charge in, but Gu Jin lifted him by his back collar to stop him from going.\u201cLaohu\u2019s entire family died in Zhongbo.\u201d Gu Jin said. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect him to let Shen Zechuan off.\u201dDing Tao said, \u201cBut wasn\u2019t the culprit Shen Wei? What does it have to do with Shen Zechuan?!\u201dGu Jin hesitated for a moment, but did not continue the conversation.Tantai Hu\u2019s blade sliced the air before Shen Zechuan\u2019s face, and Shen Zechuan spun around to kick his blade-holding wrist askew. As soon as Tantai Hu\u2019s arm went numb, he hurled his blade out.Right at that time, the curtain to the office was lifted. Yang Zongzhi, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of War, stared at the blade with widened eyes as it came hurtling towards him.Chen Yang instantly raised his arm in an attempt to grab the hilt. But who would expect Xiao Chiye to be faster? With a swing of his sheath, he struck the blade down into the snow.The steel blade stabbed into the ground with force so violent it shocked the entire courtyard of\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0into kneeling. They said in unison, \u201cViceroy, please pardon our offense!\u201dIgnoring them, Xiao Chiye hung his blade back and raised his hand to lift the curtain for Yang Zongzhi. With an apologetic smile, he said, \u201cI failed to discipline my subordinates and have thus caused alarm to Vice Minister Yang.\u201dHow would Yang Zongzhi dare to linger? After concurring awkwardly for a couple of times, he hurried out of the courtyard, got into his horse carriage, and slipped away without even wanting anyone to see him off.Once Xiao Chiye was done seeing him off, he turned back to look at the entire courtyard of kneeling men.Knowing that he was in the wrong, Chen Yang hastened to say, \u201cViceroy, it\u2019s this subordinate who has been negligent in my supervision and didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve watched the show long enough.\u201d As Xiao Chiye spoke, Meng landed on his shoulder. He took out some white meat and fed it to the gyrfalcon, saying only, \u201cZhao Hui wouldn\u2019t do such a thing.\u201dChen Yang\u2019s face turned white.Xiao Chiye did not reprove Chen Yang as he stood before the others, because Chen Yang was his chief of guards and his trusted aide. He could not give Chen Yang a slap in the face right under the watchful eyes of the men, since that would make him lose his standing among his\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0brothers and make him unable to hold his head up before them. But these words of his cut Chen Yang\u2019s heart the deepest.Chen Yang and Zhao Hui were both men with good potential that Xiao Fangxu selected himself. Zhao Hui was calm and steady, and his meritorious military deeds were innumerable as he followed under Xiao Jiming\u2019s command. He was a deputy general whom few would dare to show displeasure to when he came to\u00a0Qudu. Meanwhile, Chen Yang had remained behind in the Libei Prince Manor until he finally followed Xiao Chiye five years ago. He was prudent, and he was most fearful of others saying that he was inferior to Zhao Hui. This was a contest between them brothers of the same clan.And Xiao Chiye\u2019s words today not only gave him a wake-up call, but also made him extremely ashamed.\u201cWhen I took over as the viceroy five years ago, it was said that the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0was all a bunch of rotten ruffians who gave scant regard to military discipline and rules and who held the viceroy in contempt.\u201d Xiao Chiye stroked Meng and said, \u201cI can\u2019t lead these kinds of soldiers. If you want to remain in the\u00a0Imperial Army, either you buck up and abide by the rules, or you pack up and scram right now.\u201dTantai Hu\u2019s chest heaved as he said indignantly, \u201cIt\u2019s as what the Viceroy said. We have all listened to you in the past. But what is he? Can he even be called a soldier? I\u2019m appointed the Vice Commander, and I\u2019m several grades higher than him. Was it wrong of me to lecture him? I may feed myself with this job, but no way am I going to bend myself over for someone who sells his ass!\u201d\u201cThe waist token he\u2019s hanging on his waist is of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. And now he is on the job as a guard. If you can sit in my position before giving him the attitude, then you\u2019d have proven yourself capable. \u201cXiao Chiye lowered his eyes to look at him. \u201cYou think you aren\u2019t in the wrong?\u201dTantai Hu straightened up his neck and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dCANG JI LOVES LIANYIN @ CANGJI.NET\u201cThen why stay on and suffer indignities?\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cLeave.\u2019Tantai Hu suddenly raised his head in disbelief. \u201cFor this man, the Viceroy wants to remove me from office?!\u201d\u201cThere shall be no personal grudges in the\u00a0Imperial Army. So don\u2019t fucking try to play matchmaker. I\u2019m not doing this for anyone.\u201d Xiao Chiye lowered his voice. \u201cI have the final say in the\u00a0Imperial Army. Since you can make your own decisions, then why call me Viceroy? Strip off this armor and remove these twin steel blades, then you are free to demand repayment for any blood debt you are owed. If you can take him down within three moves, I, Xiao Ce\u2019 an, will immediately kowtow to you and acknowledge my mistake. But when you don this armor and hang up the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s token on your waist, then you can only obey me. Every one of you here had a great show to watch today. You trample all over my dignity to your great delight. You have backbone. You\u2019re gutsy enough. So what\u2019s there for us to talk about military discipline? Wouldn\u2019t it be much more gratifying for all of you to scram and become the Kings of the Mountains7\u00a0instead?!\u201dEveryone lowered their heads and dared not say a word more. Meng finished eating his meat and raised his head high to stare at them.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cDon\u2019t you usually like to say that I\u2019m a muddle-headed lecher? Then I\u2019ll do precisely that today. I\u2019ll revoke Tantai Hu\u2019s waist token and send him out of the door!\u201dThe\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0said in unison, \u201cViceroy, please be appeased!\u201dTantai Hu would not admit his mistake. He pulled the waist token off with a trembling hand and said, \u201cAs brothers with the Viceroy, I\u2019ve received the Viceroy\u2019s kindness these five years, and I\u2019m even willing to lay down my life for the Viceroy! But what wrong am I guilty of today? The Viceroy wants to break my heart and dismiss me from my post because of a pretty man. Fine! I, Tantai Hu, concede defeat!\u201dWith that, he placed his waist token and helmet together on the ground and kowtowed thrice \u2014\u00a0thud, thud, thud\u00a0\u2014 to Xiao Chiye. Then he rose to his feet and stripped off his armor. Wearing only his inner garment,8\u00a0he looked at Shen Zechuan.\u201cI\u2019ll see how long you can survive by seducing those you serve!9\u00a0I will naturally seek vengeance on the Biansha baldies in the days to come. But you won\u2019t be able to run either!\u201dTantai Hu wiped his eyes and cupped his fists to everyone around him.\u201cMy brothers, we shall meet again!\u201dThen he strode a step forward and left for real.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 : Wolf &amp; TigerA charcoal fire burned in the hall, making the room hot.Chen Yang had already been kneeling for a little less than an hour. Xiao Chiye sat at the head seat reading military books.\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0generals of all ranks were also kneeling beyond the curtain. It was silent, both on the inside and outside.As the saying goes, \u201cif the general has yet to have the prestige to speak of, then he should first awe and intimidate to boost his prestige.\u201d1\u00a0When Xiao Chiye took over the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0five years ago, he had put on an initial show of strength and power upon assuming office. What he wanted was the absolute authority to command this pack of heroes. In these five years, he had been fair in meting out rewards and punishments. He never skimped on the money that was meant to be paid out to the\u00a0Imperial Army. Not only did he not give less, he even spent much more to make up for any deficiency. He was very generous to his subordinates. Yet, that cloak of his was still the same one his eldest sister-in-law had sent over three years ago.The Autumn Hunt enabled the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0to hold their heads high. It put them in the limelight, overshadowing the Eight Great Training Divisions. For a moment, they had the world at their feet. These soldiers, who have been oppressed for a long time in\u00a0Qudu, used to put on a submissive front before the Eight Great Training Divisions. Now, they even dared to boss the Eight Great Training Divisions around.This was not a good sign. Complacency would lead one to get too carried away by success.Xiao Chiye needed an opportunity to knock some senses into the\u00a0Imperial Army. And the Tantai Hu today was it.Chen Yang did not dare to raise his head. Xiao Chiye rapped on the table, and Chen Yang immediately got up to refill the tea for Xiao Chiye. Once the cup was filled, he kneeled back down again.Xiao Chiye never said a word the entire night, so Chen Yang kneeled on the ground all night.Many words, left unsaid, could make one feel more ashamed than if it had been said.Xiao Chiye had to attend\u00a0morning court\u00a0the next day. After dressing and tidying himself up, he said to Chen Yang, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to follow me today. Take a break.\u201dChen Yang had kneeled until both his legs were numbed. With his hands on the ground, he kowtowed and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cMaster\u2026\u201dHe had always addressed Xiao Chiye as Viceroy. This call came right from the heart.Sure enough, Xiao Chiye stopped in his tracks. But still, he did not look back.Chen Yang kowtowed again and said, \u201cI implore Master to punish me.\u201dXiao Chiye raised his hand to signal to those waiting upon him to leave. It was only when there was no one else in the hall that he turned aside to look at Chen Yang. \u201cIf a man has done nothing wrong, then what punishment is there to speak of?\u201dThe sweat on Chen Yang\u2019s forehead dripped past his eyes. \u201cThis subordinate has realized the errors of his ways.\u201d He said.After a long silence, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThese years, Zhao Hui has followed\u00a0dage\u00a0on war expeditions to the frontier. He has been climbing the ranks. Within five years, he should receive his own residence and a conferred title. You are both good men Father himself picked out. Why is it that he, Zhao Hui, could have that kind of honor and glory while you, Chen Yang, have to follow and rot away with a hoodlum?\u201dChen Yang\u2019s lips paled. He said, \u201cHow would this subordinate dare to think so? The\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0has his own strengths. But it\u2019s Master who is my pillar! Zhao Hui and I are both brothers of the same clan. We share weal and woe together.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019d be best if you truly understand this principle.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cBrothers who fight among themselves and family who draw swords at each other2\u00a0are all rotten to the core. Outsiders don\u2019t even have to make their moves for you to meet your end before them. You followed me and remained in\u00a0Qudu, leaving all the matters back at home to Zhao Hui to look after. His younger sister married the Vice Director of the Ministry of Rites, and you are the one who filled in the role of family from her maternal home and backed her during Spring Festival3\u00a0and other festivities. You can contend with will and spirit if you want to make great contributions and accomplish great tasks, but not so when it comes to moral principles. It\u2019s having righteous ardor and heroic spirit that makes a good man. What\u2019s your fear and hurry to compete with him? Zhao Hui wouldn\u2019t do what happened yesterday, because he has\u00a0dage\u2019s dignity to consider. You are now the chief of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s guards, yet you still need to rely on that bit of trick to inspire confidence in others. For that bit for gratification, you would even let others trample over your Master\u2019s dignity.\u00a0 Tantai Hu came from Zhongbo. You know that. But you still swapped him to yesterday\u2019s roster so that he could vent his anger and resentment. So, what is it, Chen Yang? Have you been following me to fool around to the point that you now have to play games like this to win others over? For this moment of satisfaction, you would not even hesitate to dent your Master\u2019s dignity.\u201dStung by remorse and self-reproach, Chen Yang lowered his head and said, \u201cI\u2019ve let Master down\u2014\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve let yourself down.\u201d Xiao Chiye suddenly said in an indifferent voice, \u201cCome back on rotational duty once you\u2019ve figured it out. Let Gu Jin follow me these few days.\u201dDazed, Chen Yang kneeled on the ground and raised his head to watch as Xiao Chiye lifted the curtain and stepped out.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan finally had a night of sleep last night. At present, he was standing beside the horse carriage, puffing out warm air as he watched the gyrfalcon hover in the snowy sky.Xiao Chiye stepped out of the door and got up the horse carriage. Gu Jin took the horsewhip and looked at Shen Zechuan.Shen Zechuan did not look at him. The curtain partially opened, and Xiao Chiye signaled to him with his eyes.Shen Zechuan immediately felt the stares on his back as the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0who had been freezing in the courtyard the entire night all looked at him. He smiled at Xiao Chiye, then made his way up.Gu Jin drove, and the carriage started to sway.Xiao Chiye handed a hand warmer4\u00a0to Shen Zechuan. When Shen Zechuan accepted it, Xiao Chiye stuck the back of his hand to the back of Shen Zechuan\u2019s hand.\u201cSo cold.\u201d Xiao Chiye said.CANG JI LOVES LIANYIN @ CANGJI.NETShen Zechuan raised his finger to push away Xiao Chiye\u2019s hand. He leaned against the wall and held the hand warmer.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cYou don\u2019t look too happy.\u201dShen Zechuan warmed up his hands and said, \u201cI\u2019m happy.\u201d He looked at Xiao Chiye and said with a smile, \u201cIt makes me happy that the Second Young Master spoke up for me and helped me out of a predicament.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cThis Second Young Master did not do it for anyone.\u201d\u201cThat may be so.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cNow that the prestige has been established, then when are you going to bestow them favors?5\u00a0There aren\u2019t many days left for me to be a guard. If you want to use me, you must hurry.\u201dXiao Chiye looked at him and said nothing.Shen Zechuan lifted his chin slightly in a pose similar to a relaxing posture. He exhaled and said after a pause, \u201cI\u2019m not your match when it comes to governing others. Shen Lanzhou is a good target. Put him before you, and you can defend yourself and put on a deliberate show of strength to intimidate the tiger.6\u00a0Maybe he can even warm your bed. This kind of killing three birds with one stone is truly hard to find.\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er, you sure are impressive.\u201dThere was a cacophony of human voices outside the carriage, while the atmosphere within the carriage grew increasingly heavy. Both men were just a few inches apart, but they seemed to be separated by a natural chasm. When the carriage arrived at its destination, Gu Jin tactfully did not say a word to disturb them.Having warmed his hands, Shen Zechuan put the hand warmer back on the small table and said, \u201cWhat a pity.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cEveryone thinks you enjoy yourself to your heart\u2019s content every night,\u201d Shen Zechuan licked the tip of his teeth and said unhurriedly to him. \u201cWho would have known you,\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er, to be a diligent and conscientious Liuxia Hui?7\u00a0I haven\u2019t even touched your saliva before, let alone talk about being fucked by you.\u201dWith that, he made to lift the curtain and get off the carriage. He did not expect Xiao Chiye to hook his waist belt.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Xiao Chiye smiled playfully. \u201cLook at how eager you are to cross swords on the bed. I shall comply with your wish.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone with such fierce eyes.\u201dThe curtain swayed. He had already gotten off the carriage.Xiao Chiye\u2019s fingertips turned up empty. He waved them, as if wanting for more.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8After Tantai Hui\u2019s incident, the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0became less ostentatious. All of them tucked their tails between their legs and behaved themselves, thus reverting to the way they were before the Autumn Hunt. Chen Yang, even more prudent now, no longer dared to close an eye when others stirred up trouble. He had previously hurt his foot in Libei, and the cold was harsh in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0a few days later, so his foot would hurt for each day he was on duty.One day, after dinner, Xiao Chiye threw Chen Yang several bottles of medicinal paste. When Chen Yang went back and opened them, they turned out to be the valuable paste that Xiao Jiming had gotten from the Venerable Yigui a few years back. He could not help but reproach himself again. From then on, he was even more diligent in his work.On the other side, Tantai Hu went home and found himself in dire straits just a few days later. Everyone in his family was dead, yet he had adopted three children from Zhongbo, all of whom lived on his salary. He was not married either, so he had no wife to manage affairs at home. All the money he received every month was spent until nothing was left. At present, he was in a short supply of rice and noodles, and he also had to prepare for the new year too. He was a veteran of Dengzhou, and he had buddies in\u00a0Qudu. But all along, he had always been the one to take care of others. Now that it was his turn, he could not bring himself to borrow money from others, so he tightened his belt to feed the children. But this was, after all, not a long-term solution.Tantai Hu was even thinking of being a loan shark and tagging along with others to collect debts when Chen Yang appeared on his doorsteps for a visit.\u201cThe new year is right around the corner,\u201d Chen Yang put down the money and said. \u201cThe Viceroy still remembers that there are three children in your family.\u201dTantai Hu turned his face away as he sat on the chair and said, \u201cSince I\u2019m no longer a soldier of the\u00a0Imperial Army, then there\u2019s no reason for me to accept money from the\u00a0Imperial Army.\u201d\u201cYou are truly a bonafide tiger.\u201d8\u00a0Chen Yang said with a severe countenance. \u201cWhy are you still pissed with the Viceroy? You struck out at Shen Zechuan with many people watching that day. Where is your respect for the Viceroy? Being too lax in military discipline is a major taboo. You have been a Vice Commander for so long. Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t understand that.\u201dTantai Hu said, \u201cWhat can I do? Whenever I see Shen the Eighth, I\u2019ll remember my parents!\u201dChen Yang sighed and said, \u201cEven so, you shouldn\u2019t have humiliated him and, consequently, the Viceroy too. You know the Viceroy\u2019s temperament after following him for a few years, so why did you still shoot your mouth off?\u201dTantai Hu rubbed his head.Chen Yang continued, \u201cI was at fault too. I knew you were rash, but I didn\u2019t stop you. Admit your mistakes if you make one, and accept your punishment if you receive one. A real man can take temporary setbacks and adapt to circumstances. Must you go to the extent of quitting before you think yourself a real hero?\u201d\u201cThen what can I do? I have already handed in the waist token!\u201d When Tantai Hu spoke to this point, he felt aggrieved and sad, \u201cI\u2019ve followed the Viceroy for five years and worked myself to the bone during the Autumn Hunt. It wasn\u2019t easy for the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0to finally make a name for itself. I get afraid when I see that fox going in and out the whole day! The way he looks\u2026 I was really afraid that the Viceroy\u2019s future would be ruined! I was getting anxious, and I hate him to death! Ding Tao said something about how it\u2019s not his fault. That\u2019s right, who doesn\u2019t know that? But who could stand it if they were in my shoes? It was my parents and siblings who died, not a dog by the roadside!\u201dChen Yang was silent too.Tantai Hu stamped heavily on the ground and wiped his face haphazardly. The scar-faced man still shed tears when he recalled the past. He choked with sobs and said, \u201cAnyone would not be happy to see a person they hate right in front of them, let alone someone with such enmity. That year when Zhongbo troops were defeated\u2026 Chen Yang, all of us who survived had our families broken up and ruined, while we ourselves barely escaped by the skin of their teeth! Who\u2019s going to take pity on us? Look at those three children in my house. They haven\u2019t even begun to recognize a few words before they were turned into orphans who have to dig mud under the hooves of the Biansha Cavalry\u2019s horses in order to live. We are all lowly creatures.\u201dChen Yang patted him and waited for him to calm down a little before saying, \u201cBut now that you have joined the\u00a0Imperial Army, the Viceroy is king. Hu-zi,9\u00a0five years ago, when the Viceroy cleaned up the\u00a0Imperial Army, he had wanted to take in non-native military households10\u00a0like you guys, but the Ministry of War did not agree. Do you still remember what the Viceroy said?\u201dTaitai Hu\u2019s shoulders shook slightly.Chen Yang continued, \u201cIsn\u2019t the reason you still want to be a soldier today because of what the Viceroy said that day\u2014\u2018The feuds of our families has yet to be avenged, and the humiliation of our nation has yet to be redressed\u2019? The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0will one day ride the horses out of the mountain pass. Isn\u2019t killing the enemies with your own hands then much more gratifying than blaming another man today? How is it that you\u2019ve forgotten this all with the passage of time?!\u201dTantai Hu said, \u201cHow would I dare to forget? I\u2019ve never forgotten it for even a day. I gave this life to the Viceroy to use as he wished, all for that one day to come.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s all good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Chen Yang got up and pushed the money to Tantai Hu. \u201cBrothers don\u2019t bear each other overnight grudges. The Viceroy treats us as brothers. This money is from the Viceroy himself. After you\u2019ve celebrated the Spring Festival, return to your original squad, hang up the Squad Commander waist token, and do your duties well.\u201dWith mixed feelings, Tantai Hu saw Chen Yang out of the door.When Chen Yang returned, he saw Shen Zechuan. Both men greeted each other on the veranda. As he lifted the curtain and went in, Shen Zechuan knew that the matter was done.Shen Zechuan was bored to death as he watched the falling snow.A vicious man like this could be disguised as fake even if he was real, and be made real even if he was fake. Others simply would not be able to tell whether the expression he put on was happiness or anger, nor would they be able to tell if he was being sincere or hypocritical.It did not take long before Chen Yang came out again. He lifted the curtain, nodded at Shen Zechuan, and said, \u201cThe Viceroy is waiting inside for you to have a meal together.\u201dShen Zechuan turned around and saw Xiao Chiye looking at him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 : Tearing &amp; BitingFresh vegetables were a rare sight in winter, and so the ones that fetched a high price in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0now were all green vegetables. Having been rewarded by Li Jianheng, Xiao Chiye\u2019s dinner table tonight included a plate of crisp, shredded cucumber.\u201cSide dishes that accompany the main dishes help to invigorate the spleen and eliminate toxins.\u201d1\u00a0Xiao Chiye scooped up a bowl of hot soup and pushed it towards Shen Zechuan. \u201cYou\u2019ve been standing outside for so long. Warm yourself up and have a refreshing meal before you take a rest.\u201d\u201cAs the saying goes,\u201d Shen Zechuan wiped his hands and took a seat. \u201cOne who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions.2\u00a0So, what instructions does the Second Young Master have?\u201d\u201cPlenty.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk as we eat.\u201dBoth men lifted their chopsticks together.There was no one else inside the room. The two bowls of rice were quickly eaten clean, as was the plate of shredded cucumber that they split between themselves. Neither of them touched the meat dishes.\u201cThe Spring Festival3\u00a0 is right around the corner, and my\u00a0shifu\u00a0is coming to the capital.\u201d Xiao Chiye drank the soup. \u201cIf Ji Gang-shifu\u00a0is free, we can arrange for both elders to meet.\u201d\u201cA new year celebration, or a Hongmen banquet?4\u00a0You have to make it clear.\u201d Shen Zechuan set down the chopsticks. \u201cMy\u00a0shifu\u00a0doesn\u2019t stake his life on games.\u201d\u201cNew year celebration.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cThere are only both of them left in this generation, and they have not seen each other in so many years.\u201d\u201cSure. I\u2019ll prepare a big gift later and ask\u00a0shifu\u00a0to come out of obscurity.\u201d Shen Zechuan had eaten his fill.Seeing him get up, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cRest in my room as usual tonight.\u201dShen Zechuan looked back and smiled as he said, \u201cNaturally, I won\u2019t run. We\u2019ll take our turns in the bath. Take your time. I\u2019ll go first. \u201cWith that, he lifted the curtain and headed inside to wash his face and rinse his mouth.Xiao Chiye called for the servants to clear the table. As he stood by the window, he saw that it was snowing outside. He turned his head and saw Shen Zechuan\u2019s silhouette through the hazy curtain fabric.Shen Zechuan removed his outer garment. It was as if he was peeling away a layer of coarse shell to reveal the fresh, tender, and succulent flesh within. When he lowered his head to undo his waist belt, the curve of his nape danced with tangerine-yellow light as if to add a velvety touch of exquisiteness to that already smooth part.Looking at him through the curtain fabric was just like scratching an itch through a boot. It magnified that temptation, which was brimming with desire, and scattered it, sending it wandering aimlessly through his limbs and bones. It tickled him so badly that it made him irritable and gave him certain violent thoughts. The man being like jade himself counted for nothing. What bothered Xiao Chiye the most was Shen Zechuan\u2019s desire.That pair of eyes. And that kind of smile. Whether by design or accident, he seemed to exude such a sexual desire.\u201cCome and hug me.\u201d\u201cCome and touch me.\u201d\u201cCome and sweat it out with me to your heart\u2019s content.\u201dThis desire was as unaggressive as a drizzle, but unbeknownst to him, it had invaded his mind. Shen Zechuan himself seemed oblivious to it. He retained another kind of indifference that was diametrically opposed to lust as he breezily threw out this contradictory puzzle for others to think about.Xiao Chiye did not want to continue to think. He was keenly aware that the \u201ceagle\u201d this time was not that easy to tame. He could only be his own master; he could not tolerate himself getting so easily and repeatedly aroused by his impulses.Xiao Chiye turned back his head, closed the window, and went to the bath hall.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Both men slept on each side with a block in between. Their backs were to each other, and their breathing was steady as if they had already fallen asleep.Xiao Chiye kept close to his thumb ring and thought of many matters.This thumb ring did not belong to him. At first, it belonged to Feng Yisheng of the Suotian Pass. When Feng Yisheng died in battle, he left the thumb ring to Zuo Qianqiu. Wearing this thumb ring, Zuo Qianqiu made a name for himself during the battle at Tianfei Watchtower, where he shot an arrow at his wife, killing her.It was because of this that Zuo Qianqiu\u2019s hair turned white, and also because of this that he never recovered from the setback. He had achieved fame and glory, but the person was dead. There was no way Zuo Qianqiu could go on the battlefield again. His hands, which once made significant achievements at Tianfei Watchtower, could no longer wield the bow freely.As a child, Xiao Chiye had followed Zuo Qianqiu to ask him, \u201cHow did you end up shooting your wife to death?\u201dZuo Qianqiu sanded the bowstring and asked, \u201cDo you really want to be a general?\u201dXiao Chiye nodded.Zuo Qianqiu said, \u201cThen don\u2019t start a family. A general dying in a hundred battles is actually not that terrifying. What\u2019s terrifying is that the general, in all likelihood, will come to be confronted with choices. What you want, and what you must shoulder, are all different things.\u201dZuo Qianqiu looked at the bow in desolation. The grassland wind caressed his white hair. He said in a daze, \u201cI hope you will never be trapped in such a desperate situation. When a man reaches that stage, he will die no matter what he chooses.\u201d\u201cYou saved tens of thousands of people at Tianfei Watchtower.\u201d Xiao Chiye leaned over the railing. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you want to be conferred a title?\u201dZuo Qianqiu laughed and said, \u201cBecause I died in battle.\u201dIt was not until Xiao Chiye grew up to be a youth that he understood Zuo Qianqiu\u2019s words. In the battle at Tianfei Watchtower, Zuo Qianqiu\u2019s beloved wife was taken prisoner. Between opening the gates to surrender, or shutting the gates to fight to the death, he could only choose one.Zuo Qianqiu chose neither. He headed out of the city all by himself and drew his bow to shoot his beloved wife to death.Legend had it that the shot was the most steady shot he had ever fired in his life. He hit his target among countless people. The rain was pouring that night. No one knew if he had cried himself hoarse, or when his hair turned white. When the soldiers retreated at dawn, Zuo Qianqiu stood upon the white expanse of bones to collect his wife\u2019s corpse and bury her.From then on, his reputation of \u201cThunder Sinking the Jade Stage, Zuo Qianqiu\u201d spread far and wide. Those who respected him would also curse him behind his back. A man who was that heartless would only make the common man think of him as a scourge, as if generals like him were all naturally born to be this cold-blooded.Xiao Chiye treasured this thumb ring very much. But he also feared it. He was afraid that he would one day be caught in a dilemma too. So he had never spoken of \u2018like\u2019 lightly.Chen Yang had been with him for so long, and he still did not know what Xiao Chiye was fond of. The wine he loved. The food he liked. The clothing he preferred. The truth was so mixed up with falsehood that no one could really tell.Libei, Libei!It was as if only this word was the destiny he had no way of hiding. He already had a taste of being in someone else\u2019s control because of desire. So how could he court trouble for himself again?Xiao Chiye sat up soundlessly and looked at Shen Zechuan. He raised his hand. He just had to exert some force, and he could smother this desire to death.Shen Zechuan looked like he was having a nightmare. As he frowned, his temples were both drenched in a cold sweat. His back was already a little damp.Xiao Chiye bent over to look at him and saw a Shen Zechuan he had never seen before.Shen Zechuan was trapped in the tide of blood. He was soaking wet all over. He touched himself. It was blood. The dream repeated itself every single day. He felt as if he was going mad.All of a sudden, Shen Zechuan gave a few subtle twitches. His tightly pursed lips slowly loosened apart to mutter something in his sleep amid his outbreak of cold sweat.He was this helpless.Something else from that deep, heavy fear suddenly dawned on Xiao Chiye. He scrutinized Shen Zechuan, like a massive beast observing its prey.Shen Zechuan was not invulnerable. Other than that unexplainable probing and dreading of each other, what they had was an even more inexplicable empathy between fellow sufferers.Shen Zechuan felt weary. He would no longer cry in his dreams, or strive to dig through the corpses. He had seen through the nightmare. He knew Ji Mu was dead.Hurry up.It was as if Shen Zechuan was an apathetic bystander.Let\u2019s get this over and done with.He urged it on brutally and ruthlessly, even wanting this blood to spill even more, and this snow to fall even harder. How else could he lay bare this nightmare? He no longer had any fear. This flesh and marrow had already been soaked rotten in the blood! He was a stray dog feeding on rotting flesh. The filthy water and abhorrence were merely evidence of his existence.Shen Zechuan suddenly opened his eyes and reached out to put his hands against Xiao Chiye\u2019s chest. In just a few moments, he asked calmly while dripping with cold sweat, \u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s chest was scalding hot. He could feel the iciness of Shen Zechuan\u2019s palms through the thin fabric. He replied, \u201cI ate too much.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cA timid person would have been scared to death if he saw a person right upon opening his eyes in the middle of the night.\u201d\u201cI heard you calling me,\u201d Xiao Chiye said without batting an eyelid. \u201cI have to determine if you were cursing me.\u201d\u201cIf I curse you, it wouldn\u2019t be in my dreams.\u201d Scalded by Xiao Chiye\u2019s body temperature, Shen Zechuan wanted to retract his fingers.Unexpectedly, Xiao Chiye pressed his hands back and asked, \u201cAre you cold?\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s temples were still soaked. He smiled and said, \u201cYeah. I\u2019m so cold.\u201dHe had reverted to that seductive Shen Lanzhou. He did not care the least whether Xiao Chiye had been tempted. This kind of ability was innate; it came to him naturally. He was a scum.Xiao Chiye gripped his hands and pinned them down at the head of the bed. Sniffing his scent in the darkness, he said, \u201cYou sleep in my bed. You know very well what I think of every night. You said that I\u2019m impressive. Shen Lanzhou, the impressive one is you. \u201c\u201cUh\u2026 what\u2019s to be done then?\u201d Shen Zechuan still sounded a little hoarse. He said nonchalantly, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201cI want to do it.\u201d Xiao Chiye bent his head down to stare at him. \u201cI want to do you.\u201d\u201cChoose some other ways to let me die.\u201d Shen Zechuan let him clasped both of his hands together. \u201cIt\u2019s too much of a failure to die in bed.\u201d\u201cI changed my mind.\u201d Xiao Chiye caressed aside Shen Zechuan\u2019s damp hair with a freed hand and looked at him as if he was scrutinizing a jewel he had bought. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to die.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cI\u2019d advise you not to bite this neck.\u201d\u201cLanzhou.\u201d Xiao Chiye said his name with a sigh and jested, \u201cWill you let me off even if I didn\u2019t?\u201dShen Zechuan looked at him.Xiao Chiye asked, \u201cIs it such a pleasure to tease me?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Shen Zechuan sensed Xiao Chiye gradually drawing closer to him. \u201cIt pleasures me to see the pitiful look of a little wolf at a loss.\u201d\u201cThen, we can be even more pleasured.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThe Empress Dowager has been putting up with it without making any moves. What did she promise to give you? Throw it away. I\u2019ll give you much, much more.\u201d\u201cUh-huh\u2026\u201d Shen Zechuan laughed, \u201cI guess freedom is not included in the list of things you\u2019re giving me.\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er, how is it that you never know that everything you want is all written in your eyes. You want to lock me up right this moment, am I right?\u201d\u201cI want to make a gold chain.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cIt\u2019s too much of a pity for this neck not to be adorned with something.\u201d\u201cDog chains were originally used to leash wolves.\u201d Shen Zechuan was so close to Xiao Chiye that he could hear the latter\u2019s breathing. He said, \u201cI want to put a gold chain around your neck too. For each word you say, I\u2019ll yank it once.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not.\u201d Xiao Chiye raised his eyebrows. \u201cWith your salary, you won\u2019t be able to afford it even if you empty your pockets.\u201dThe tips of their noses were about to bump into each other. Xiao Chiye\u2019s thumb ring was pressing against Zechuan\u2019s wrist, which had already reddened from his grip.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cSince it\u2019s\u2014\u201dShen Zechuan raised his head and kissed him on the lips. Icy derision followed right on the heels of this encounter of soft lips.\u201cWant to go wild with abandon?\u201d The expression in Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes was deranged as he murmured, \u201cDo you dare? Try tearing me apart,\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er. I don\u2019t care.\u201dThe tightly wound string that was Xiao Chiye\u2019s limit snapped with a \u201ctwang\u201d, and those already tempestuous waves of emotions gushed forth with a roar. Amidst this mocking and instigation, he ruthlessly pinned down Shen Zechuan and kissed him back as if he was biting him.Lust interweaved with murderous intent. Hatred entangled with pity. Exactly who between them was the more detestable and pitiable one?Tongues intertwined in this wet kiss, where Xiao Chiye kissed Shen Zechuan, and Shen Zechuan gave all he could to respond. There was the sensual sound of licking between their lips and teeth as desire burned up two abnormal men.Xiao Chiye suddenly released his grip on Shen Zechuan\u2019s wrist and supported his back up, wanting them to press against each other intimately, skin to skin.This was mutual loathing.Tainting the other party with the filthy stain that was their own. Letting hatred turn into a bond that could not be torn apart. It was too much of an agony to live like this, being the only ones who could hear their own howls in the night. So why not come together and tear each other bloody? Let this visceral intimacy metamorphose into a form of solace they could rely on.This life was already rotten enough.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 : LanzhouClothing was shoved up high, and skin that radiated out like moonlight felt icy cold to the touch. There were no caresses, only the tearing apart of each other. The thick, tangible night melted away into an expanse of spring water\u2014into a night of heated passion and intoxicating pleasure. Xiao Chiye scooped up this water. He struggled to prop himself up among the tidal waves of emotions and saw Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes as he gasped for breath.In this pair of eyes, there was none of the temperature of one drowning in lust. They even reflected his absurd behavior at this very moment.Xiao Chiye felt a wave of thrill cutting through him like a blade. He fondled Shen Zechuan until he made him hot\u2014until he made this water rage. He bound Shen Zechuan from high in the clouds into the crooks of his arms and squashed him hard as he licked and nipped at him wantonly. Biting down on the back of Shen Zechuan\u2019s neck was like taking in a mouthful of enchantment potion1\u00a0into his mouth.The night was thoroughly wet, and the bedding was soaked in sweat. Intertwining limbs thrashed around on the bed, and it was in these urgent collisions that Xiao Chiye gradually got a grasp on happiness. He progressed swiftly, surrendering himself in that mass of soft clouds, and hardening in the same mass of soft clouds. He pushed up hard silently against Shen Zechuan\u2019s vital spot, so much that Shen Zechuan had to strain to gulp even as his raised neck fearlessly exposed itself before Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes.Xiao Chye kissed this neck and scooped up both of Shen Zechuan\u2019s knees. He was no longer a hypocrite untempted by lust.2\u00a0He was an ordinary man who stormed the enemy\u2019s den and went in for the kill in the dark. He made it impossible for Shen Zechuan to remember the Chashi sinkhole, and made it just as impossible for Shen Zechuan to forget this intense merging of bodies.They had no life-saving straw to clutch at. This was a night of indulgence to break free of their misery. Pleasure blazed through their bodies like a raging inferno. Shen Zechuan reached out for the headboard, and Xiao Chiye dragged him back and locked him in an embrace.\u201cGo on, show me how feral you can get.\u201d Xiao Chiye whispered, \u201cYou want me to go wild with abandon, so how dare you run? Don\u2019t you want to see who is more savage? I\u2019m not afraid.\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s cheek chafed against the bedding as he closed his eyes and gasped for breath. The expression of pain, of being unable to take it, on this face was all a captivating seduction.How did he blossom into such a visage?Xiao Chiye pinched his chin and held it up to kiss him without letting him pant or rest. In the time the sides on the back of his waist3\u00a0were numbed, he ejaculated completely into him.Shen Zechuan was still shuddering from the climactic high, but Xiao Chiye did not stop. He turned Shen Zechuan over and thrust in again.The cold wind howled endlessly outside the window, and the suppressed sounds of panting cut through the darkness. Xiao Chiye dripped with sweat as he kissed Shen Zechuan over and over again.He did not want to concede defeat.But he had already been vanquished.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xiao Chiye fell asleep.The ferocity and fury in his features had all dissolved away into a kind of displeasure from being brash. He held onto one of Shen Zechuan\u2019s wrist, making it seem like both men were snuggling against each other this winter night, consequently turning those merciless kisses into a scalding hot furnace.Outside, the snow fell for the entire night, drifting gently like willow catkins. The sound of wind was nowhere to be heard.When it was nearly daybreak, Shen Zechuan extracted his wrist from Xiao Chiye\u2019s grip. Xiao Chiye\u2019s fingers chased after him, moving under the bedding.Chen Yang, who was outside the door, saw Shen Zechuan come out of the room.\u201cMilitary drill grounds.\u201d Shen Zechuan said concisely.Chen Yang nodded. As he was about to make way, he caught a glimpse of the injury on Shen Zechuan\u2019s lips. He looked as if he was about to say a word, but hesitated.Shen Zechuan glanced at him and saw through what he was thinking, so he said, \u201cThe Imperial Bodyguard\u2019s reorganization deployment order should be issued these few days. Thank you for your kind treatment during this period of time.\u201dChen Yang said, \u201cA few days earlier\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s over is over; there\u2019s no need to speak of it.\u201d Shen Zechuan was gratuitously cold today. He said, \u201cWe will all be patrolling\u00a0Qudu\u00a0in the future, so it\u2019ll be inevitable for us to bump into each other. I\u2019ll act with caution, and I\u2019d advise the various\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0brothers to be prudent as well.\u201dChen Yang paused.But Shen Zechuan smiled and continued, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy for the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0to be where they are today. But time changes, and every dog has its day, so who can say for sure when it comes to the future?\u201dWithout waiting for Chen Yang to answer, he lifted his robe and left.Ding Tao patted the snow off his shoulders and fell over to hang in mid-air. Swinging with his brush in his mouth, he gazed at Shen Zechuan\u2019s back with a frown.On seeing this, Chen Yang asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dCANG JI LOVES LIANYIN @ CANGJI.NETDing Tao said: \u201cDon\u2019t you think he is a little sad today?\u201dChen Yang turned his head to see the corner of Shen Zechuan\u2019s robe. He said, \u201cIs that so? He seems fine to me. He\u2019s smiling.\u201dDing Tao fished out his book from his bosom and wrote a few characters while suspended in mid-air. He lamented, \u201cMaybe it was because he had a fight with the Second Young Master last night. That was quite the commotion from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201dFeeling a little embarrassed, Chen Yang looked up and said, \u201cGu Jin, didn\u2019t you teach him about the birds and bees? From my calculations, this lad is already sixteen. In Libei, it\u2019d be time for him to marry a wife.\u201dGu Jin did not reply.Chen Yang said, \u201cDo you hear me?\u201d\u201cHe has cotton stuffed in his ears!\u201d Ding Tao stuffed the book back into his bosom and turned back to remove the cotton in one of Gu Jin\u2019s ears. He shouted, \u201cJin-ge! Chen Yang is calling you!\u201dGu Jin gave a start and nearly slipped down from above. He shoved Ding Tao\u2019s face away and frowned as he poked his head out to ask, \u201cWhat?\u201dChen Yang pointed to Ding Tao and said, \u201cSend him away. Sell him and add to your wine budget this month.\u201dGu Jin grasped Ding Tao by the neck and said, \u201cHe can\u2019t sell for much going by this weight.\u201dThere were movements inside the room, and all three men simultaneously fell silent. After a while, Xiao Chiye came out of the room. As he put on his clothes, he swept a glance around, then looked at Ding Tao.\u201cDage\u00a0will be coming to the capital in a few days,\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s lips hurt a little when he spoke. He pressed his tongue against it but gave up quickly. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to submit reports of trivial issues.\u201dDing Tao nodded his head hard, like a little chick pecking at grains.After a moment\u2019s pause, Xiao Chiye asked, \u201cWhy are you still here?\u201dDing Tao scratched the back of his head in puzzlement. He looked at Chen Yang, then at Gu Jin, and finally back at Xiao Chiye. He said, \u201cYoung Master, I\u2019m on duty today.\u201dXiao Chiye questioned, \u201cWhere\u2019s the man I told you to keep an eye on?\u201dDing Tao said, \u201cHe, he already left\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye said nothing. When Chen Yang led the horse over, Xiao Chiye flipped onto it. Just before he left, he pointed to Ding Tao. \u201cThrow him out.\u201dDing Tao had yet to climb up the horse. Before he could react to Xiao Chiye\u2019s words, he was already hoisted up by Chen Yang and Gu Jin. The color drained from his face as he clutched his little book and said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t. Young Master, Young Master! I did nothing wrong these days\u2014\u201dHe had already been tossed out.After throwing him out, Chen Yang stepped forward and said, \u201cMaster,\u00a0shifu\u00a0should be arriving today.\u201dWithout saying a word more, Xiao Chiye spurred his horse on and headed out of the city.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan did not go to the military drill grounds at Mount Feng. Instead, he braved the snow to return to Zhao Zui Temple.Ji Gang had not seen him for several days, so he rushed to buy roast chicken after letting Shen Zechuan in. It had been a while since Grand Mentor Qi last saw him too. At this moment, he was holding a brush and squinting his eyes to write characters. On seeing Shen Zechuan enter, he hurriedly threw the brush away and called out to him, \u201cLanzhou!\u201dShen Zechuan lifted his robe to sit upright opposite Grand Mentor Qi.Grand Mentor Qi said, \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019 deployment order is about to be issued soon, right? Where do you want to go?\u201dShen Zechuan replied, \u201cThe Imperial Carriages Office. Close to the Emperor.\u201dGrand Mentor Qi nodded. On seeing the wound on Shen Zechuan\u2019s lips, he switched the topic and asked, \u201cHas something happen outside lately?\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cNow that His Majesty has Hai Liangyi to protect him, I fear that even a hopeless case can pose as a pillar of the state, much like a rotten wood pretending to be a beam.4\u00a0Back then, when I saved\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er, it was because the ascension of His Majesty to the throne was a foregone conclusion. Killing him would, on the contrary, mess up the chessboard.\u201d\u201cA messed-up chessboard is nothing. What\u2019s to be feared is a messed-up heart and mind.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi looked at him. \u201cHave you gained any new perspectives all these days you were staying by Xiao the Second\u2019s side?\u201dShen Zechuan wiped the ink stains on his fingertips and thought for a long time before saying, \u201cIt\u2019s too much of a pity for him to be born after Xiao Jiming. It\u2019s fine if they can keep him under control in this life, but if they can\u2019t\u2026\u201dShen Zechuan looked at Grand Mentor Qi, but did not continue his words.But Grand Mentor Qi said, \u201cLanzhou, you still don\u2019t get it.\u201dShen Zechuan was slightly stunned.Grand Mentor Qi stood up and paced for two steps. Gazing at the snow in the courtyard, he suddenly let out a long sigh. \u201cYou killed Ji Lei.\u201dShen Zechuan stopped wiping.In a rare philosophical state, Grand Mentor Qi said, \u201cLanzhou, we are both trapped here. We live on hatred, but we mustn\u2019t let ourselves be killed by hatred. Five years ago, you couldn\u2019t have done such an utterly ruthless act. But five years later, you can already take charge to do such a clean and efficient job of it. I imparted the classics to you, but I don\u2019t want you to be manipulated by hatred. It\u2019s hard to be righteous when you take the lives of the living. You won\u2019t be able to turn back if you fall too far. Without exorcising your inner demons, you will forever be trapped in a nightmare. Ji Lei deserves death, and it\u2019s still death for him even if you end him in one slash. Think about your days in Duanzhou. I have no wish to see you walk a cold-blooded and cold-hearted path. You said it\u2019s a pity Xiao Chiye was born after Xiao Jiming. What I\u2019m going to tell you is the exact opposite.\u201d\u201cJust imagine for a moment that Ji Mu is the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0of Libei today. Can there be no other reason for him to leave you in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0other than a lack of alternatives?\u201d\u201cThe sharp edge of a treasured sword comes only by honing it. Xiao Chiye is a sword. He has yet to notice it himself, but his elder brother has, for many years, placed high hopes on him. Libei has never been stingy with praises that he deserves either. If he\u2019s a son without a use,5\u00a0they would have chosen to dote on him to make him happy. But Xiao Jiming not only took him to battles, he even gave him a free hand in leading the troops. Since he\u2019s already left with no room for retreat, then was his handing over his younger brother really just to make him miserable? Five years ago, in Libei, Xiao Chiye did not know how to exercise restraint, but now, he has already learned how to rein in his arrogance and willfulness. Everything learned from word-of-mouth can be superficial; It\u2019s only those you come to understand through your own sufferings that are the real masterstroke. Xiao Jiming is a great elder brother. Being born after Xiao Jiming is never the most pitiful thing about Xiao Chiye. Lanzhou, this brotherly sentiment should be something you understand the most. Yet it has now become the brotherliness you understand the least.\u201dGrand Mentor Qi paused for a long time, looking somewhat gloomy and depressed. Then he looked at Shen Zechuan again and kneeled to pat Shen Zechuan slowly on the head with his wizened palm.\u201cTeacher taught you the classics and gave you the courtesy name Lanzhou. Unruffled is the orchid6\u00a0that grows on stone steps. Boundless is the horizons of the boat7\u00a0that crosses the sea of misery. Wide is the heart that accommodates a hundred rivers, and broad is the vision that encompasses a thousand lakes. You\u2019re a good child. Killing is merely a means to an end.8\u00a0Hatred may be hard to eliminate, but your heart must never change.9\u00a0Lanzhou, oh Lanzhou, don\u2019t you still have your\u00a0shifu\u00a0and teacher? Why must you force yourself into such a corner? It may not be a bad idea to just voice out your unhappiness these five years.\u201dShen Zechuan stared blankly at Grand Mentor Qi.\u201cTwenty-five years ago, His Royal Highness the Crown Prince left. How I long every day, and resent every night, for not being able to take that blow for him, to kill the enemy with my own hands. I stewed in resentment until I turned into this state. I became your teacher. I.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi choked a little with emotion. \u201cI want you to kill my enemy for me. But I can\u2019t have you turn into a blade who has forgotten who you are\u2026 You are a person, Lanzhou. Don\u2019t forget your carefree days in Duanzhou. Although Ji Mu died, he didn\u2019t die because of you. It\u2019s Heaven\u2019s decree. What is past is past. You did not escape and survived the Chashi sinkhole to shoulder a sin. You are the continuation of existence for him, for those 40,000 soldiers! Silly child, Ji Gang has been so careful, so how did he still let you lead yourself so astray that you\u2019d blame the wrong person?!\u201dShen Zechuan closed his eyes.He heard Ji Mu\u2019s calls, and he thought of Xiao Chiye\u2019s scent. At this very moment, he finally understood why he was so infatuated with that scent. That was the brilliance of the scorching sun\u2014the light that could allow him to escape from the Chashi sinkhole.Even if it were only for a moment, it would allow him to forget the tides of blood and the rain of arrows, to forget the cold and the corpses. He could no longer remember the days in Duanzhou. They were too distant. So distant that they seemed to be the memories of his past life. He could no longer even recall Ji Mu\u2019s heartily laughing face. He had plunged into a nightmare, tormenting himself every single moment.Ji Mu was dead.CANG JI LOVES LIANYIN @ CANGJI.NETWhy wasn\u2019t he the one to die that day?The fact that his\u00a0shifu\u00a0did not blame him was the greatest reproach of all. What he could not struggle free of was the sense of guilt that would haunt him for a lifetime. There was no way he could tell Grand Mentor Qi candidly that, with the passage of time, he had finally killed off himself.Xiao Chiye was the reflection on the other end who had everything he did not have. He observed Xiao Chiye, clumsily trying to imitate him so that he could let himself look more like a person. He could not tell anyone that the Shen Zechuan living in this body was a repulsive killer.He was already standing at the edge of the abyss.Shen Zechuan lowered his eyes under Grand Mentor Qi\u2019s palm like a child respectfully listening to his teachings. He listened devoutly. Yet, it was in this very instant that he realized he was no longer able to shed tears.His throat throbbed slightly. Eventually, he said, feeling comforted, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 as Teacher said.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Three days later, the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019 deployment order was announced. Han Cheng, the original Assistant Commander of the Eight Great Training Divisions, was transferred over to be the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019 Commander-in-chief, while staff from the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019 Twelve Offices were reassigned. Shen Zechuan was redeployed from the Domesticated Elephants Office to the Imperial Carriages Office, and Ge Qingqing was promoted from Company Commander to Judge.10Shen Zechuan\u2019s new waist token had the word \u201cEmperor\u2019s Entourage\u201d. The Imperial Carriages Office was a great place to go, since being close to the Emperor would make it easiest for him to get into the Emperor\u2019s good graces.Xiao Chiye, originally the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s Viceroy, also took on the post of the Eight Great Training Divisions\u2019 Commander, thereby legitimizing his authority over the patrols of\u00a0Qudu. After that one night, he welcomed Zuo Qianqiu and stayed at the military drill grounds in Mount Feng. Even until the time Shen Zechuan left the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s residence, both men never saw each other again.\u201cMaster.\u201d Chen Yang attended to Xiao Chiye at the latter\u2019s side and said in a soft voice, \u201cThe original arrangement was the Domesticated Steeds Office. Who would have expected it to be the Imperial Carriages Office when the deployment order was issued.\u201dXiao Chiye was solving a \u2018Chinese Rings\u2019 puzzle.11\u00a0His hand movements slowed as he said, \u201cThat could only mean he didn\u2019t care for it.\u201dChen Yang said, \u201cBut isn\u2019t going to work in the Emperor\u2019s presence makes it much easier for him to meet with misfortune that\u2019ll cost him his life? Secretariat Elder Hai was the one who urged the former Emperor to kill him back then.\u201d\u201cDemanding repayment right on the crux of the matter. His heart is not on carrying out his duties lawfully.\u201d Xiao Chiye tossed away the rings and said, \u201cJi Lei is dead. Han Cheng is a stand-in from the Eight Great Training Divisions. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0is now without a master. What do you think he wants to do by stepping up now?\u201dChen Yang pondered for a moment and said, \u201cIf he becomes\u2026\u201d\u201cIf he succeeds.\u201d Xiao Chiye looked towards the military drill grounds. \u201cThen he will have his claws and fangs.\u201d12Chen Yang did not venture to speak.A little while later, Xiao Chiye continued, \u201cThe Ji Clan dominates the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. He has Ji Gang as his shield. It\u2019s simply effortless for him to move up using past relationships and old sentiments as his blade. Although we can\u2019t get our men in, we can limit his chances. There has to be a justification for getting a promotion and riches. If nothing goes wrong before the Emperor, then he can be held back from making any moves. Since the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0now has the responsibility of patrolling, then why trouble the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards?\u201dChen Yang said, \u201cThis subordinate understands it now .\u201dXiao Chiye drank a mouthful of water, thought for a moment, then said, \u201cPick a low-key place and lay the table for a feast. Him and I \u2013 we\u2019ll pick our fights and we\u2019ll still have our meals.\u201dHe pursed the part of his lips that had been bitten.\u201cAfter all, we could be considered fellow disciples of the same school of martial arts.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 : Red Plum BlossomsXiao Chiye fixed the date for the feast before the Banquet of a Hundred Officials. Chen Yang went to deliver the invitation, but Ge Qingqing was the one who came to receive it.\u201cLanzhou has been on duty in the Emperor\u2019s presence lately. He doesn\u2019t have any free time, so I\u2019ll receive this on his behalf.\u201d Ge Qingqing kept away the invitation. Once he was done exchanging conventional greetings with Chen Yang, he said. \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0now has the world at its feet. I suppose Deputy General Chen is busy as well?\u201d\u201cThe Viceroy has been working hard on official documents every day. As men who follow and serve him, there\u2019s no such thing as being busy.\u201d Chen Yang drank the tea and said, \u201cGe-xiong received a blessing out of misfortune this time and was promoted to Judge.1\u00a0Your future is bright. That\u2019s truly impressive.\u201dBoth men feigned civility as they spoke cordially with one another and tried their best not to disgrace themselves. Conflicts had arisen between the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0and\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0lately, resulting in some discord. They were now at a point where they would loathe each other on sight.It was only when his cup was changed to a fresh cup of tea that Chen Yang got up to say his farewell. Ge Qingqing saw him out, and Shen Zechuan, who was inside, lifted the curtain to walk out.\u201cThis invitation came at a bad time.\u201d Ge Qingqing handed the invitation to him. \u201cAre you really going?\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Shen Zechuan opened the invitation and saw Xiao Chiye\u2019s forceful and bold calligraphy.\u201cXiao the Second\u2019s inhibition of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0is building up momentum these days. Our missions keep getting intercepted by the\u00a0Imperial Army. Furthermore, he has the trust and favor of the Emperor. If he were to do something right this moment\u2026\u201d Ge Qingqing\u2019s voice trailed off.\u201cWhat he wants to do couldn\u2019t be any more obvious.\u201d Shen Zechuan closed the invitation. \u201cHe wants to suppress the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0and turn\u00a0Qudu\u00a0into a territory under his control so that His Majesty only has his\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0to rely on. As to be expected, he will still deal a few more blows to the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards.\u201d\u201cExactly. It\u2019s too risky at present to take Uncle Ji along to the feast.\u201d Ge Qingqing said.Shen Zechuan offhandedly tossed the invitation onto the table and said, \u201cThis involves Zuo Qianqiu. He won\u2019t lay a trap here.\u201dGe Qingqing still did not feel too reassured.The wound on Shen Zechuan\u2019s lips had healed. He put on his overcoat and said, \u201cI\u2019m going out for a while.\u201dShen Zechuan waded through the snow and headed out. The snow was not heavy today, but the wind was strong. He arrived at Donglong Street and made his way to Ouhua Pavilion at the opposite corner of Xiangyun Villa.Xi Hongxuan had recently composed some classical poems.2\u00a0The tunes on the music scores were handed to the courtesans on Donglong Street to sing, and it unexpectedly turned into a grand occasion. Best of all, he had hollowed out the ground at the foot of Ouhua Pavilion stage and filled it with open-mouthed copper jars with only a layer of wooden plank spread out on top. At the same time, he also bought a new batch of young girls from Juexi. After training them for many days, he secured bells on their ankles, so that when they danced on the stage with their wooden clogs stepping out a rhythm, the sounds of the bells would merge into the copper jars. It was ethereal and wonderful.At present, those on the stage were still singing Xi Hongxuan\u2019s poem. Grasping his folding fan, he reclined against a rattan chair on the third floor and listened with closed eyes. A maidservant did not make any sound as she stepped on the woolen rug wearing only plain socks. She kneeled outside the bead curtain and said softly, \u201cSecond Master, the guest has arrived.\u201dWithout opening his eyes, Xi Hongxuan shut his fan.LIANYIN @ CANGJI.NETThe maidservant rose to her feet and lifted the curtain for Shen Zechuan.Shen Zechuan entered and saw another girl kneeling at Xi Hongxuan\u2019s feet to massage his legs for him.\u201cInvite Young Master Shen to take a seat.\u201d Xi Hongxuan was still tapping out a rhythm as he focused on the singing.The kneeling girl shuffled over on her knees and attempted to help Shen Zechuan take off his shoes. Shen Zechuan raised a hand to stop her and sat down on a chair.It was only when the tune ended that Xi Hongxuan sat up. As he drank his tea, he pointed at the girl with his fan and said, \u201cShe\u2019s new and untainted.\u201dShen Zechuan did not look at her.Xi Hongxuan laughed. Looking at him, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve really involved yourself with Xiao the Second? What? You still want to keep yourself chaste for him?\u201dThe hair on Shen Zechuan\u2019s temples looked as if they were soaked in ink, yet in this warm room, the contrast made his facial features seem distant. It gave him an otherworldly aura. He said, \u201cSince you\u2019ve called me here, then cut the chatter.\u201dXi Hongxuan spread open his folding fan. With his obese body crammed into the rattan chair, he said, \u201cWe are buddies. I see you having a hard time staying by Xiao the Second\u2019s side, so I called you here today to let you have a good time. If we were to speak of being pitiful, then you, Shen Lanzhou, wins hands down. Xiao the Second gave you a kick in the past, sowing the seeds of illness and making you chronically sick and frail. And now you still have to pretend to be chummy with him. He is really your nemesis.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Shen Zechuan did not evade the topic. He seemed resigned. \u201cHe\u2019s such a jerk.\u201d\u201cBut from how I see it, he doesn\u2019t seem to be planning to leave the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0any leeway.\u201d Xi Hongxuan said. \u201cLanzhou, looks like your pillow talk didn\u2019t really sway him.\u201d\u201cYou are a besotted man.\u201d Shen Zechuan accepted the warm handkerchief the girl presented to him to wipe his hands. A smile at the turn of his eyes, and that coolness he wore when he stepped through the door vanished without a trace and subconsciously embellished his usual expression. \u201cYou think of your dear sister-in-law with such perseverance and consistency. After bedding her once, you shower her with favor and love her to bits. But it\u2019s just a one-night stand between\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0and me. How could it be considered love?\u201d\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is\u2026\u201d Xi Hongxuan picked up the chopsticks. \u201cYou\u2019re just having a fling?\u201d\u201cEven having a fling is an art.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cEveryone tumbled in bed once, each with his own needs. It\u2019s over once the merrymaking is done. If you keep thinking of it every day, then it wouldn\u2019t be purely a fling anymore, would it?\u201dXi Hongxuan clasped his hands and laughed out loud. He said, \u201cWell, well! What a fine Lanzhou. I was afraid he might have you by the balls, and you\u2019d forget that we are the ones who are comrades in the same boat. Here, here. Come and taste this dish. These are wild vegetables delivered with the greatest urgency from Qinzhou. It\u2019s good stuff that even the Imperial Kitchen doesn\u2019t have.\u201dBoth men picked the dishes to sample.Xi Hongxuan said, \u201cThis Xiao the Second is truly something else. No one paid him any attention in the past, and then he showed his true mettle in the Autumn Hunt. Now he can\u2019t hide it anymore, so he simply charges head-on with disregard to obstacles posed by the others. He took over the military affairs of the Eighth Great Training Divisions, yet handed all the key positions to his trusted aides. As a result, none of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0has any real power. But he kept up his pretenses so flawlessly that no one could get any dirt on him at all. Tell me. Doesn\u2019t that piss you off? Isn\u2019t that hateful?\u201dShen Zechuan saw a dish of shredded cucumbers on the table, but he did not touch any of it. He said, \u201cXiao\u2019Er\u00a0burned all his boats at the Nanlin Hunting Grounds. He staked it all on the chance that His Majesty will remember their friendship and let him go. But this hope was all in vain, much like drawing water with a sieve. What\u2019s more, he ended up being closely watched by the Six Ministries. He can\u2019t turn back time, so he could only ensure that he holds real military power in\u00a0Qudu. Compared with the Eight Great Training Divisions, the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0is like fireflies and the bright moon. They are useful, but not\u00a0that\u00a0useful. It hasn\u2019t been easy for him to finally gain the upper hand now. Naturally, he will not pass up the opportunity.\u201d\u201cIn the past, there was still Pan Rugui in the\u00a0Twenty-four Yamen, and the\u00a0Eastern Depot\u00a0could, no matter what, take him down a notch. But now that Pan Rugui is dead, the\u00a0Eastern Depot\u00a0has gone into decline too. Fine then, there\u2019s really no one in such a big\u00a0Qudu\u00a0who can beat him, Xiao Ce\u2019an!\u201d Xi Hongxuan took a bite of the food and said, \u201cI\u2019ve not been in His Majesty\u2019s favor these days. His Majesty now listens to Hai Liangyi, having made up his mind to be a wise monarch of a golden age. He\u2019s no longer that willing to play with me now.\u201dShen Zechuan finished his food and said unhurriedly, \u201cA person who has lived for over twenty years would have already formed a fixed temper. If a mere few words can make him mend his ways, then nothing else in this world will be difficult.\u201dXi Hongxuan\u2019s chopsticks paused. He said, \u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d\u201cHai Liangyi is a gentleman among gentlemen.\u201d Shen Zechuan set aside his chopsticks. \u201cHe\u2019s like the water so crystal clear you can see its bottom. His encounter with the current Emperor is like water coming into contact with hot oil. Sooner or later, it will explode and splatter all over. Xue Xiuzhuo has long reached this position, but why isn\u2019t he willing to go further? Grand Secretariat, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s not like he isn\u2019t qualified. What the Central Administration lacked right this moment are precisely talents.\u201dXi Hongxuan mulled it over in silence.Shen Zechuan said, \u201cNow that foreign enemies are before us, how can the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0still stand divided and do things their own ways? You have already become the head of the Xi Clan. As they said, fortunes rise and fall. Now that the opportunity is within reach, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to let it go?\u201dXi Hongxuan set aside his chopsticks. He wiped his sweat with his handkerchief and looked at Shen Zechuan to ask, \u201cYou want me to contact the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0and get them to join forces to deal with Xiao the Second?\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cXiao\u2019Er\u00a0is only just one of them. Nowadays, the civil officials are in favor. Consequently, the Imperial College looks to be on the up and up. Within a few years, the sons of common birth from humble families will enter the official ranks one after another. When that happens, what\u2019s going to happen to all the precious sons of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0who are used to loafing around? If the poor rise in power, leading to an emergence of new nobles, then Second Young Master,3\u00a0the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0will no longer be the \u2018Eight\u2019 Great Clans.\u201dXi Hongxuan said, \u201cEven so\u2026 this is too thorny an issue. Leaving everything else aside, that Yao Wenyu will never agree. He\u2019s Hai Liangyi\u2019s student, one whom Hai Liangyi himself personally instructs. These years, he has traveled over the world for his studies and made the acquaintance of countless talents and sages. He definitely won\u2019t form an alliance with us.\u201dShen Zechuan said with a smile, \u201cEight Great Clans\u00a0just mean the\u00a0eight great clans. There\u2019s no reason for it to be just these eight clans. If the Yao Clan doesn\u2019t cut it, then just change to another one.\u201dXi Hongxuan did not eat anymore. He pushed aside his chair and walked around the room. After some time, he looked at Shen Zechuan. \u201cBut do you have any way to keep Xiao the Second still? If he wants to protect the Emperor, then he won\u2019t just sit and do nothing. I\u2019m not worried if it\u2019s just him. But there\u2019s the Libei Armored Cavalry standing behind him. With Xiao Jiming around, Xiao Ce\u2019an can\u2019t be touched nor harmed. He\u2019s too tough to deal with!\u201d\u201cXiao Jiming is formidable, but his power and prestige all lie at the frontier.\u201d Shen Zechuan propped up his head. The eyes under the shadows could not be seen clearly. He gave Xi Hongxuan one last push. \u201cQudu\u00a0is your place. As they said, a mighty dragon is no match for a serpent in its territory.4\u00a0Ways are aplenty if you want\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0to be too up to his neck dealing with his own affairs to interfere.\u201dXi Hongxuan was so deep in thought that he did not realize that Shen Zechuan had said \u201cyour\u201d and not \u201cour\u201d. He asked, \u201cWhat ways?\u201dShen Zechuan let out a soundless laugh and said, \u201cXiao\u2019Er\u2019s influence depends entirely on His Majesty\u2019s trust. They have been buddies for many years with merry days of drinking behind them. What\u2019s more,\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0has saved his life. So there\u2019s indeed nothing to be done about it for a moment. But things like friendship are just like autumn dew hanging on branches. It\u2019ll be gone once you leave it out to dry under the full, blazing sun.\u201dXi Hongxuan looked at Shen Zechuan. He recalled Ji Lei on that rainy night, and all the mountain games and wild vegetables he had swallowed earlier churned in his stomach. He forcibly braced himself so that he would betray nothing in his expression and said with a smile, \u201cSince you have got it all worked out, then tell me.\u201dAfter Shen Zechuan left, Xi Hongxuan lay back on the rattan chair and got the waiters to clear the table. It was a challenge for him to turn over, so he needed someone to help him. He felt alarmingly stifled for no reason and had the men open the windows.Xue Xiuzhuo came out from the partitioned-off area. Xi Hongxuan lamented, \u201cYou heard it too, right? Fortunately, he was born as Shen Wei\u2019s son. If he were to rise in power, he would be even more difficult to deal with than Xiao the Second.\u201d\u201cTo use someone, you have to use the right method.\u201d Xue Xiuzhuo poured tea. \u201cThere is no one in this world who has no desires and wants. Shen Lanzhou has his weaknesses too. As long as we have a grasp on it, then even the most vicious dog is nothing to be feared.\u201d\u201cBut we can\u2019t find any.\u201d Xi Hongxuan tapped the center of his forehead with his fan. \u201cLook at how callous he is towards Xiao the Second. It\u2019s obvious he turned his back on him after getting off the bed. Humiliation and flattery don\u2019t work on this kind of evildoers. You can\u2019t even threaten him.\u201dXue Xiuzhuo swallowed the tea, smiled, and said in a gentle and refined manner, \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry? Just do as he says. Success or not, it\u2019s all a disaster for Xiao the Second. When the time comes, he will expose his own true motives.\u201dShen Zechuan headed downstairs, but did not rush to leave. The procuress greeted him. She only knew he was Xi Hongxuan\u2019s honored guest, so she fawned on him and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s Master looking at? Looking cannot be compared to trying them out in person.\u201dShen Zechuan sized up the gorgeously dressed courtesans and asked, \u201cDo you have male courtesans?\u201dThe procuress twisted her body around and said to the person behind her, \u201cLead this Master upstairs and get a few clean, tender-faced boys to serve him.\u201dShen Zechuan sat in the room for a short while before three male courtesans entered. He swept a glance at them; they were all neatly tidied up.The procuress was astute and knew how to choose appearances. After looking through the entire building, she could not find anyone who was more gorgeous than Shen Zechuan, so she took the unconventional gambit of sending him delicate-looking youths.The boys stepped forth to take off Shen Zechuan\u2019s shoes, but Shen Zechuan slightly shifted his feet away; thus, they kneeled and did not dare to move again.Shen Zechuan gazed out of the window. After a while, he said, \u201cStrip.\u201dThe three of them obediently shed off their clothes. Shen Zechuan looked at those fair shoulders when they were midway through stripping, but from start to end, his heart remained as calm as still water. He then looked at their hands; each looked like girls\u2019 hands, as if they had led pampered lives.There were no calluses on their hands. And they were not wearing thumb rings either.Shen Zechuan slowly breathed out a sigh and rose to his feet. Without even bothering to announce his departure, he pushed the door open and left, leaving behind the three male courtesans to look at each other in astonishment.Ding Tao had been following Shen Zechuan. Seeing him finally walk out of Ouhua Pavillion, he meticulously jotted down a note in the little book that was now crumpled from being clutched by him. By the time he was done recording, he saw Shen Zechuan merging into the crowd. Ding Tao did not dare to be negligent, so he hurriedly chased after Shen Zechuan and followed him at a safe distance.Shen Zechuan was not really walking that fast, yet, in just a blink of an eye, he disappeared.Ding Tao let out an exclamation of surprise and hurried over, only to have his path blocked by a tall and sturdy man wearing a bamboo hat. As soon as he neared the other party, he knew that this was a man well-versed in martial arts!It was jam-packed with people all around. Ding Tao did not wish to hurt them, so he endured it and did not act out. This, consequently, allowed Shen Zechuan to shake him off. He shook a fist, but then he felt a sense of familiarity from that tall and sturdy man earlier.The snow intensified as soon as it was dark.The tall and sturdy man walked for some distance while holding down his bamboo hat. But the moment he turned, he entered a blind alley.Shen Zechuan stood behind him and cast a glance at him. He said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been following me for half a month. What do you want?\u201dThe tall and sturdy man pressed his bamboo hat lower, but let out a laugh and said, \u201cHow sharp. To think you noticed it early on.\u201d\u201cYour breath-concealing skills are outstanding.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you teach me some tricks yourself? You disappear without a trace the moment you are released from prison, so that they\u2019d chase after you out of\u00a0Qudu. You sure have gone to great pains.\u201dThe man lifted his bamboo hat to reveal a face with stubble. Qiao Tianya blew at the wisp of hair before his forehead and said, \u201cIt\u2019d have been fine for you to lure me into a wine shop. Do we have to stand here and talk?\u201d\u201cJade\u00a0Rabbits are hard to catch.\u201d Shen Zechuan looked at him for a moment and said, \u201cShould I call you Qiao Tianya? Or Songyue?\u201dLIANYIN @ CANGJI.NET\u201cAs you please.\u201d Qiao Tianya said, \u201cCall me Qiao Tianya, and we\u2019d be acquaintances. Call me Songyue, and you\u2019d be my master.\u201d\u201cYour Excellency is a capable man. How did you come to bow down and submit to my teacher?\u201d Shen Zechuan asked.\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Qiao Tianya let out a self-mocking laugh. \u201cI owe my life to Grand Mentor Qi, and I have to repay it by toiling hard like an ox or a horse for him for the rest of my life.\u201d\u201cSo the reason everything went smoothly at the hunting grounds that night\u2026\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201c\u2026 was because of your help.\u201d\u201cTaking you as my master means that it\u2019s your cues I\u2019m taking.\u201d Qiao Tianya said, \u201cYou originally wanted to kill the Prince of Chu that night, but you didn\u2019t expect Xiao the Second to be so bold as to stuff him right before the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0to dupe them and lead them on a wild goose chase. However, you are quick-witted. You could actually even seize the opportunity to give Xiao the Second a helping hand.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all the capability I have.\u201d Shen Zechuan said.Qiao Tianya patted the snow off his shoulders and said, \u201cI\u2019ll follow you in the future, Master. If there\u2019s meat to eat in the future, don\u2019t forget to give me a bowl of soup to drink. I\u2019m much easier to provide for than those guards of Xiao the Second.\u201d\u201cDing Tao is young,\u201d Shen Zechuan threw the money pouch at him in passing. \u201cChen Yang and Gu Jin are the ones who are the tough nuts.\u201dQiao Tianya took the money and said, \u201cYou have gotten such a clear handle on Xiao the Second. But he is still thinking about how you\u2019ve saved his life.\u201dShen Zechuan smiled, \u201cYou really want to follow him, huh.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a guard with unwavering loyalty,\u201d Qiao Tianya innocently raised his hands. \u201cIf Xiao the Second is willing to buy me for a thousand gold, I\u2019ll naturally be willing to go through fire and water5\u00a0for him.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cA pity it\u2019s already crowded around him. How would there be any place left for you?\u201d\u201cMy littler master\u2026\u201d Qiao Tianya tilted his head and squinted an eye to say, \u201c\u2026 has a truly vicious mouth.\u201dShen Zechuan put on a \u201cyou flatter me\u201d expression.\u201cBut this line\u2026 \u201cQiao Tianya grinned, \u201c\u2026 is applicable to both of us.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Eight days later, Shen Zechuan and Ji Gang arrived as planned.Ding Tao had obviously made his complaint known. Gu Jin, who did not drink today, stood outside the door. From a distance away, he saw Qiao Tianya, who was following behind Shen Zechuan.Ding Tao immediately tiptoed and whispered, \u201cJin-ge, that\u2019s him. He\u2019s the one!\u201dShen Zechuan and Ji Gang were led through the door by Chen Yang. Qiao Tianya naturally had to remain outside. But he did not have that self-awareness, and his leg that was about to stride forward was blocked by Gu Jin.\u201cI heard you stood in this lad\u2019s path a few days ago.\u201d Gu Jin looked at the bamboo hat with sharp eyes. \u201cWhat kind of hero are you for bullying a child?\u201dDing Tao snorted with righteous indignation and parroted, \u201cWhat kind of hero?!\u201dQiao Tianya burst out laughing. He backhandedly took off his bamboo hat and said with a cheeky grin, \u201cAren\u2019t we here for a meal tonight? So why are we still going to fight? It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen this little buddy here. Bro, have you gotten the wrong person?\u201dDing Tao let out an exclamation and fumed, \u201cHow can you say that? I wouldn\u2019t mistake you for someone else!\u201dGu Jin stopped Ding Tao and faced Qiao Tianya.Two men of almost the same height came face-to-face until they were almost bumping against one another.Gu Jin said, \u201cToday is not the right time. Let\u2019s set a date for later.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not free.\u201d Qiao Tianya tugged at that wisp of hair before his forehead and threw Gu Jin a provocative smile. \u201cAfter all, my Master only has me. Where on earth would I have that much free time to raise a younger brother for fun?\u201dGu Jin coldly spat out a mouthful of saliva and said, \u201cTell me your name. There will be plenty of occasions for us to meet in the future.\u201d\u201cThis humble servant is Qiao Yueyue.\u201d Qiao Tianya tapped his temple at Ding Tao with two fingers. \u201cAlso known as Xiaosongsong.\u201d6Chen Yang led Shen Zechuan and Ji Gang inside. This courtyard was deep. They passed the\u00a0chaoshou\u00a0veranda7\u00a0and stepped through a moon gate8\u00a0to the elegant view of an entire courtyard full of red plum blossoms.Xiao Chiye was standing under a tree waiting when Shen Zechuan stepped in. They exchanged glances for a fleeting second, but before that subtle feeling could be conveyed, both men simultaneously averted their gazes.Xiao Chiye welcomed Ji Gang and greeted him with a smile, \u201cPlease excuse me for not going out to meet\u00a0shishu\u00a0even though\u00a0shishu\u00a0has\u00a0 braved the snow to come here. The wine and dishes have been prepared.\u00a0Shifu\u00a0has been waiting inside for a long time.\u201dJi Gang looked at Xiao Chiye and stopped him from paying his respects. He said, \u201cYour\u00a0shifu\u00a0has broken away from the Ji Clan over twenty years ago, and your martial arts now has a distinctive style of its own. Since we aren\u2019t from the same school of martial arts, there is no need to be overly polite.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cOur martial arts can be traced to the same origin, and so that means we are from the same school. It\u2019s all thanks to the initiation of the Ji Clan Fist Style that I could master the blend of martial arts from various clans today. I\u2019ve long heard of\u00a0shishu\u2019s\u00a0reputation, and I admire\u00a0shishu\u00a0for it. So no matter what, this respect must be paid.\u201dXiao Chiye bowed in respect and led Ji Gang inside. He did not forget to turn his head and said to Shen Zechuan, \u201cLanzhou and I have not seen each other for a long time, too.\u201dShen Zechuan strode through the door and said with a smile, \u201cShixiong\u00a0has such power and influence now. You must be busy.\u201d\u201cWe are from the same school of martial arts.\u201d Xiao Chiye said in a neutral tone. \u201cI\u2019ll have to leave some time aside for you no matter how busy I am.\u201d\u201cHow would it do for you to delay your work because of me?\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cI\u2019ve been on idle duties every day lately, and this is already all thanks to\u00a0shixiong\u00a0for looking out for me.\u201d\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d Xiao Chiye lifted the curtain. \u201cIf you want to be busy, just come to me. I will sweep the couch clean to await you any time.\u201d9Shen Zechuan\u2019s nape started aching when he heard the word \u201ccouch\u201d. There seemed to be a lingering heat at those spots where he had been bitten before; it was so scalding that his smile faded.Zuo Qianqiu was dressed in a wide-sleeved robe with slanting collars, with white hair pulled up into a bun. He did not look like a refined scholar or an awe-inspiring general. He was clearly several years older than Ji Gang, yet he looked younger than Ji Gang. If he had to be described, then it would be that he had an otherworldly aura to him. It seemed that the rumors in the\u00a0martial fraternity\u00a0of him becoming a monk were not totally groundless.Zuo Qianqiu turned around and saw Ji Gang.Ji Gang was dressed in short-length plain cotton clothing10\u00a0with a thick jacket. He stood there, with a disfigured face, and looked at him. In an instant, the past came surging forth. Cheers and laughter of youths rang close in his ears, but the man before him was already old and white-haired.Xiao Chiye broke the silence and said, \u201cBoth\u00a0shifu\u00a0shall have their meals in here, while Lanzhou and I shall wait outside.\u201d\u201cChuan-er, fasten your overcoat properly.\u201d Ji Gang looked lonely as he turned sideways and urged Shen Zechuan, \u201cCome in if you feel cold.\u201dShen Zechuan nodded.LIANYIN @ CANGJI.NETZuo Qianqiu said, \u201cA-Ye, take care of your\u00a0shidi.\u201dXiao Chiye smiled in acknowledgment, and both men retreated out.It\u2019s cold outside, yet it\u2019s a rare clear night.Shen Zechuan descended the stairs and saw the deep woods of red plum blossoms. There was a bridge within. This courtyard was so refined it did not seem to be Xiao Chiye\u2019s style.\u201cThis courtyard was bought with money from the Yao Clan.\u201d Xiao Chiye seemed to know what Shen Zechuan was thinking. He stood behind Shen Zechuan and raised his hands to brush aside the red plum blossoms to reveal the surrounding clear stream. \u201cPretty. And expensive too.\u201d\u201cAnd you still bear to part with the money.\u201d Shen Zechuan did not look back.Xiao Chiye bumped lightly into Shen Zechuan\u2019s back with his chest and raised a hand to cover the top of Shen Zechuan\u2019s head. He leaned in close to Shen Zechuan\u2019s ear and said flippantly, \u201cRed plums blanketed in snow. Fragrance enveloped Lanzhou. His smile\u2019s worth a thousand gold.\u201d\u201cYou must have even put up your pants as collateral.\u201d Shen Zechuan really began to smile slowly.\u201cI had to spend a sum, yes. But Yao Wenyu was already selling it at a low price.\u201d Xiao Chiye paused and continued, \u201cYou ran pretty fast. To avoid me, you\u2019ve spent a lot of effort too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m avoiding you.\u201d Shen Zechuan lifted his finger to push away Xiao Chiye\u2019s palm. \u201cBut is there an important matter we need to discuss face-to-face?\u201dXiao Chiye smiled and said with a little ruthlessness thrown in, \u201cCan\u2019t you dote on your Second Young Master a little after bedding him?\u201dShen Zechuan took a few steps forward to leave Xiao Chiye\u2019s chest, then turned to scrutinize Xiao Chiye without saying a word.In this starry night adorned with plum blossoms, both men finally, in retrospect, came to understand something.Xiao Chiye discovered that what he had grabbed that night was water. Once it flowed past, it was really gone. Shen Zechuan was not even the slightest reluctant to leave. After the frenzy of biting and tearing at each other, that lingering heat had also ended up buried under the colors of the night. In the ecstasy where Shen Zechuan had raised his neck in intoxication, he had not seared him \u2013 Xiao Ce\u2019an \u2013 into his memories at all.Once again, Xiao Chiye distinctly realized one thing.He was the only one who was defeated by lust that night.\u201cI advised you before.\u201d Shen Zechuan raised his fingers to hold down the plum blossoms branch\u00a0 and said bewitchingly to Xiao Chiye, \u201cThat it\u2019d be best not to bite this nape.\u201d\u201cBedroom pleasure\u2026\u201d Xiao Chiye revealed a frivolous smile. \u201c\u2026 is not something I can do alone.\u201d\u201cThe greatest difference between you and me is desire. You are covered in desire all over. You spare no effort to hide your wild ambitions. A nape is merely one of the minor adversities. You hold me back, wanting to resist it, wanting to defeat it, but in the end, you still lose to it. But Ce\u2019an.\u201d Shen Zechuan plucked a plum blossom, tore the petal, and delivered it to his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t even have lust. So how are you going to pit yourself against me?\u201dXiao Chiye drew a step closer and grabbed Shen Zechuan\u2019s flower-holding hand. He bent over to press in close to him and said breezily, \u201cWhat is one time? So boring. We should do it a few more rounds. You couldn\u2019t use those courtesans from Ouhua Pavilion, and you didn\u2019t dare to touch those boys too. You pretend to be a celibate and aloof sage. But I wasn\u2019t the one who gasped and panted so delicately that night.\u201dXiao Chiye pulled Shen Zechuan\u2019s hand to his lips, pressed against it dangerously, and scoffed.\u201cIt\u2019s true I\u2019ve lost to lust. But if you are that steadfast, then why did you try stirring up a storm under the sheets11\u00a0with me? Shen Lanzhou, you are much more afraid of succumbing to desire than I am, aren\u2019t you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 : AtlasAfter three bouts of drinking in the house, much of the sense of estrangement had dispersed. Although they still had not warmed up to each other, it was already more than enough for them to have a chat over wine.Ji Gang removed the muffler around his neck and took a sip of wine. When Zuo Qianqiu saw the burn marks on his exposed neck too, he could not help but ask, \u201cBack then, the Biansha Cavalry invaded Duanzhou. How did you\u2026 how did you end up in this state?\u201dJi Gang twirled his wine cup around and smiled, \u201cShen Wei beat such a quick retreat that Duanzhou did not even hold out for a day. The horses of the Biansha Cavalry were too fast, and my legs aren\u2019t as fast as they used to be, so how could I have escaped? At that time, I was already ready to fight to the death.\u201dAt this point, he thought of Hua Pingting and could not help but choke with emotion. He turned his head aside and rubbed his face. He did not continue.Zuo Qianqiu downed the cup of wine and said, \u201cShen Wei deserved to be killed!\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Shen Wei who deserves death.\u201d Ji Gang said bitterly, \u201cThe defeat of the Zhongbo troops was so fishy. For the blame to be pushed to Shen Wei alone means that they were certain he wouldn\u2019t survive.\u201dZuo Qianqiu said, \u201cYou have been away from\u00a0Qudu\u00a0for a long time. How can you be so sure that Shen Wei was a scapegoat?\u201d\u201cFive years ago, when Chuan-er entered the capital, someone plotted against him while he was in the\u00a0Imperial Prison.\u201d Ji Gang said, \u201cAt that time, Shen Wei was already dead. Yet someone still wanted to wipe out his family to eradicate potential sources of trouble. Why? Wasn\u2019t it precisely because they wanted to silence him?\u201dZuo Qianqiu drank his wine in silence. After a while, he said, \u201cNow that they are all dead, I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t be easy to relaunch a thorough investigation into the defeat of Zhongbo troops. Is your disciple thinking of seeking revenge for Shen Wei?\u201dThe wine had already gotten to Ji Gang\u2019s head. These five years, he had completely abstained from drinking, and he could be said to have broken his vow of abstinence tonight for Zuo Qianqiu. Holding on to the table edge for support, he sneered, \u201cRevenge. Why would Chuan-er want to seek revenge for Shen Wei? Zuo Qianqiu, how can you be as narrow-minded as they are?! Are you telling me that everyone in the world with the surname Shen is guilty of sin? Chuan-er has grown up. He\u2019s sensible enough to know better, and he can tell right from wrong. He and Shen Wei just happened to be born as father and son. Other than that body of flesh he got from Shen Wei, they have nothing to do with each other. Why are all of you pushing him into such a corner? Shen Wei is already dead! Shouldn\u2019t you look to the Biansha Cavalry to avenge this so-called blood feud of Zhongbo?!\u201dJi Gang suddenly smashed the wine cup. His chest heaved.\u201cConducting a thorough investigation of the Zhongbo\u2019s troops defeat isn\u2019t for anyone, but to get to the bottom of the matter. Why should he be made to bear such a sin?! You have been a general too. Haven\u2019t you thought of it? Five years ago, someone could make the Zhongbo\u2019s troops suffer a defeat. Five years later, he could do the same to another place! Back then, the Biansha Cavalry could keep up with such a tight pursuit. Would they have been able to do it without inside help and map?!\u201dZuo Qianqiu sighed and said, \u201cGang-di,1\u00a0 please be appeased. Back then, when Jiming rushed over to Zhongbo, the first thing he did was to cut off the main route leading from Zhongbo to Dancheng in order to investigate where the Twelve Tribes of Biansha\u2019s information came from. But the situation was critical at that time. Do you know how difficult it was? All the evidence pointed to Shen Wei. Yet, Shen Wei just had to burn himself to death, leaving behind a son of common birth whom he did not favor. How could anyone not get suspicious?\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Ji Gang said, \u201cThat kick your disciple gave him almost killed him.\u201dZuo Qianqiu downed the wine again and said, \u201cI won\u2019t defend him, but listen. Gang-di, we each have our own experiences, and we each act in accordance with our own wants.\u201dJi Gang sneered and said, \u201cSure thing. Just pay lip service and consider it a closed case.\u201dWithout saying a word more, Zuo Qianqiu turned over an empty cup and shouted out, \u201cA-Ye!\u201dThe door opened right at once. Zuo Qianqiu poured wine with one hand and tossed a cup over with the other hand and said, \u201cApologize to your\u00a0shishu\u00a0and\u00a0shidi.\u201dLIANYIN @ CANGJI.NETJi Gang leveled his chopsticks and caught the wine cup on the tip. He said, \u201cWe were the ones whose skills left much to be desired back then. Chuan-er, come and make the toast!\u201dAs soon as the words left his mouth, he turned the wine cup towards Shen Zechuan. Xiao Chiye blocked it mid-air and said, \u201cLanzhou, let\u2019s not fight with\u00a0shixiong\u00a0over this, alright?\u201dShen Zechuan lifted his leg to hit Xiao Chiye\u2019s arm askew. That wine cup wobbled and fell. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard for one to defy his\u00a0shifu\u2019s orders.\u00a0Shixiong, please give way to me.\u201dBoth men\u2019s palms intersected. Xiao Chiye backhandedly pushed back Shen Zechuan\u2019s arm. That wine cup was about to hit the ground, but Shen Zechuan extended his leg and lifted it to bring the wine cup up again.There seems to be the sound of the wind as both men exchanged blows. That wine cup rose and dropped, but not even a drop of wine was spilled.Without letting up his chopsticks, Ji Gang ate a few mouthfuls of cold dishes and said, \u201cThis martial art stance is not imparted from the Ji Clan.\u201dZuo Qianqiu looked at both men and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the Xiao Clan\u2019s martial arts. It\u2019s like a raptor grabbing its prey. Once caught, it\u2019ll be hard to break free. Lanzhou, focus on attacking his lower body to throw him into confusion.\u201dShen Zechuan immediately withdrew his hand and took a step back to throw out a sudden kick. Xiao Chiye dodged a little. He wanted to say something to Shen Zechuan, but in the end, he said nothing in the presence of both\u00a0shifu. As he parried the blow, he grabbed hold of Shen Zechuan\u2019s ankle and took advantage of the obstruction of his body to grope Shen Zechuan\u2019s leg along the curve of Shen Zechuan\u2019s calf. Then he gently led Shen Zechuan toward himself.\u201cHow ruthless,\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s expression was calm. \u201cYour kick makes me too powerless to resist.\u201dBeing touched by Xiao Chiye caused Shen Zechuan to almost lose his balance, and he still had to catch hold of the wine cup. Xiao Chiye patiently waited for him to catch the wine cup before he suddenly threw out a punch right in Shen Zechuan\u2019s face.\u201cJi Clan Fist!\u201d Ji Gang\u2019s chopsticks paused. He held back for a moment, but in the end, he conceded, \u201c\u2026 No wonder Chuan-er praised him.\u201dThis body of his was simply too suitable. His punch was so perfectly executed that even Ji Gang could not find fault with it.Shen Zechuan made a grab for the wine cup with one hand, but it was ill-advised for him to press on and catch hold of it, so he abruptly leaned back. The wind that exploded forth from Xiao Chiye\u2019s fist swept past his temple. Before he could get up, Xiao Chiye strode forward and pressed in towards him. In passing, he lowered the fist he had thrown out and reached inside Shen Zechuan\u2019s collar to pinch out the remnant of the plum blossom that Shen Zechuan had bitten earlier.\u201cYou\u2019ve fallen for my trap.\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes glinted with mischief as he sent this half of the plum blossom into his mouth. Shen Zechuan wanted to get up, but Xiao Chiye thwarted his attempt and raised his head to say quickly, \u201cThe wine is spilled!\u201dStunned, Shen Zechuan lifted his head for a look\u2014and Xiao Chiye grasped hold of his hand and pushed his thumb up along Shen Zechuan\u2019s inner wrist to drink up the wine in one toast from Shen Zechuan\u2019s hand.\u201cThank you\u00a0shidi, for the wine.\u201d Xiao Chiye immediately stepped back and said gentlemanly, \u201cThe taste of it leaves a lingering aroma on the buds.\u201d2The inner side of Shen Zechuan\u2019s wrist was still scalding from being stroked by Xiao Chiye. He rose to his feet and bowed with a brandish of his sleeves before putting the wine cup back on the table.Ji Gang did not know about the exchange of undercurrents between them. On seeing the outcome, he said, \u201cThe difficulty in blending the stances of a hundred schools of martial arts is in threading them together into one. You have taught him well.\u201dZuo Qianqiu said, \u201cHe still has a long way to go. Lanzhou specializes in Ji Clan mental techniques. His focus is truly impressive.\u201dBoth men poured wine again, while Xiao Chiye and Shen Zechuan retreated out for the second time.The moment the door closed, Xiao Chiye grabbed hold of Shen Zechuan and said, \u201cThis bout of drinking won\u2019t end tonight. It\u2019s cold outside. Let\u2019s sit inside the house.\u201dThe original study of the Yao Clan was to the north of the corridor. In order to keep the room dry so that the books would not be damaged, a sleeper wall was built underneath. The books had yet to be removed at the moment, and all four shelves of the open bookcase were full of antique calligraphy and paintings.Xiao Chiye took off his overcoat and sat at the desk with one leg over the other to flip through a book. He said, \u201cThis courtyard was originally built by the Old Master of the Yao Clan. Plenty of good stuff is hidden here. Yao Wenyu doesn\u2019t like to play with them, so they have been shelved here all this time and have never been moved before.\u201dShen Zechuan wiped his hands clean before touching the books on the bookshelf.Those from the Yao Clan loved books. The Old Master of the Yao Clan had sorted them out into different categories and arranged them neatly. It had been so long, and yet the pages were still clean. It must have been Xiao Chiye who got someone else to take good care of them once he took over the compound. There was not even a speck of dust on them.Both men each stayed at a side. No one spoke again.Shen Zechuan, having kept his eyes open, saw a Hongyan picture book in the local records. He opened it and, sure enough, saw the chorographical map of the Hongyan Mountains.[For help with the upcoming text, you can refer to the maps\u00a0HERE.]Hongyan Mountains were divided into two ranges: the east and west. The west mountain range passed through Luoxia Pass to connect to Quancheng and separate out Huaizhou. It used to be the line of defense at the borders of Dazhou. Later, Xiao Fangxu expanded the territory and extended the line of defense all the way to the east mountain range, thereby shaping Libei\u2019s Great Commandery into the way it was today.Shen Zechuan flipped towards the back and saw a detailed description of the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path.Qudu\u00a0dispatched to all the granaries in the world, with army provisions mostly transferred from Juexi\u2019s Qinzhou. Deliveries towards the two major regions of the north and east could not be done through the waterways, so they could only dig out bridle paths for the specific purpose of transporting provisions. The situation in Qidong was more complicated, whereas Libei\u2019s Northeast Provisions Bridle Path was clear-cut. Food provisions were transported from Qinzhou to Yongyi Harbor,3\u00a0from Yongyi Harbor to\u00a0Qudu, then from\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to Quancheng. From Quancheng onwards, they could spur the horses on in a straight line along the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path to reach Libei Great Commandery.The Northeast Provisions Bridle Path was an important military supplies transportation route of Libei, guarded by multiple layers of Libei Armored Cavalry. Even if the Emperor himself went, he would not be able to pass through without Xiao Jiming\u2019s Commander\u2019s Tally4\u00a0for Authorization of Passage. All along, the defense of the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path had always been unassailable no matter how brutal the battles at the borders were. Not once had they ever allowed the Biansha Cavalry to get close before.In fact, five years ago, when the troops of Zhongbo were defeated, the reason Xiao Jiming had been able to deploy troops to the south so swiftly was because the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path just happened to cut across the northwestern side of Cizhou. This gave him the confidence to dispatch his troops right at once.\u201cThe Northeast Provisions Bridle Path.\u201d At some point in time, Xiao Chiye had leaned over towards him. He swept a few glances down along Shen Zechuan\u2019s hands and asked, \u201cAre you interested in the deployment of troops into battles too?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d Shen Zechuan replied without thinking.\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Second Young Master will teach you.\u201d Xiao Chiye held Shen Zechuan by the wrist and led his finger to slide towards the easternmost Chashi River. \u201cYou recognize this place, right? The Chashi River of Zhongbo is Dazhou\u2019s easternmost line of defense. Pass through it, and you\u2019d be in the Great Desert of Biansha. Come to think of it. It\u2019s pretty interesting. All along, Biansha had only dared to attack the Bianjun Commandery.\u201dShen Zechuan looked down along his finger at the southeast corner of Tianfei Watchtower. There, close to the desert looking like the only breach to Dazhou, was the Bianjun Commandery.\u201cBecause the Bianjun Commandery is too much of a coincidence. The places above it have Tianfei Watchtower to bar the way, while the places below it have Suotian Pass to block off access from the side. Only the Bianjun Commandery is a strategic point in the southeastern part of Dazhou that cannot make use of the terrain to fortify its defenses.\u201d Xiao Chiye moved closer and focused on the map. \u201cIt\u2019s here where the Lu Clan defends. You know of Lu Guangbai\u2019s title? The reason he\u2019s called \u2018Fire Beacon Amidst Blowing Sand\u2019 is because the Lu Clan defends tens of thousands of\u00a0li5\u00a0of desert fire beacon towers. The Biansha Cavalry are crafty. They like to launch night assaults. Every time they cross swords, Lu Guangbai has to light up the fire beacons. The Bianjun Commandery Garrison Troops is Dazhou\u2019s best infantry for night attacks. They are experts at laying ambushes.\u201dXiao Chiye was a little excited by the time he spoke to this point. So he simply held Shen Zechuan\u2019s finger and pointed to the Bianjun Commandery.\u201cOf the four generals in the world,\u00a0shifu\u00a0is the general most skilled in defenses, as necessitated by the terrain of the Tianfei Watchtower, so there is no need to press an attack or dispatch troops. Don\u2019t be fooled by how unremarkable the Bianjun Commandery look. In fact, the one best at attrition warfare6\u00a0is Lu Guangbai. Even my eldest brother and Commander-in-chief Qi aren\u2019t as formidable as him when it comes to this.\u201d\u201cThere are no cavalry in the Bianjun Commandery.\u201d Shen Zechuan turned his head slightly to the side and cast a glance at him.Xiao Chiye smiled. He seemed particularly relaxed at this moment. He said, \u201cLu Guangbai doesn\u2019t need them. His soldiers are the bane of all cavalries. The Lu Clan has been standing guard in the desert for generations. The climate is bad, and the wasteland can\u2019t be cultivated at all. They are genuinely poor, so they can\u2019t afford to raise horses. But even without horses, the battles still need to be fought. So the Lu Clan developed a battle array through trials and errors for the specific purpose of resisting cavalries.\u201dShen Zechuan looked back at the map. \u201cBy interesting, are you referring to how unusual it was for the Biansha Cavalry to deviate from their usual way of doing things to storm the Chashi River\u2019s line of defense five years ago?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d When Xiao Chiye was deep in thought, he would turn his thumb ring out of habit. But at this moment, he was holding Shen Zechuan\u2019s hand; thus he ended up pinching the latter without seeming to be conscious of this act. \u201cYou have to know one thing first. The Twelve Tribes of Biansha is a collective title. At the start, there were over twelve tribes of them in the desert. The Huiyan Tribe, which has dealings with Libei\u2019s mutual trade market, is a small tribe that was driven out of their land rich in water and grass by the other tribes. To survive, they threw in their lot with Dazhou. In short, the current Twelve Tribes of Biansha are distinguished between the strong and weak too. They never had a designated sovereign, so they have never been able to come to an agreement with us and could only fight. Actually, each battle fought is a heavy blow to Biansha. Their strongest tribe \u2013 the Hanshe Tribe \u2013 lies to their north, dealing primarily with the Armored Cavalry of Libei. While their swiftest Gouma Tribe lies to the south, dealing primarily with the Garrison Troops of the Bianjun Commandery. These are fixed patterns formed over long periods of confrontations\u2014but five years ago, the Hanshe Tribe and Gouma Tribes came together in the middle to deliver a severe blow directly to the Chashi River\u2019s line of defense without warning.\u201dXiao Chiye paused.LIANYIN @ CANGJI.NET\u201cThere is only one possibility in such a situation.\u201d\u201cThey had a plan all worked out in advance.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cThey were sure that Zhongbo could not stop them, and Libei and the Bianjun Commandery would not come to the rescue in time.\u201d\u201cAnd that was how rumors that Shen Wei had colluded with the enemies came about.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cIt was a very risky thing for them to dive straight in. It won\u2019t be easy for them to rely solely on their spoils of war to continue battling7\u00a0in an unfamiliar environment. They are already used to galloping across the desert. To them, combat on the streets is like fighting with their hands and feet bound. Furthermore, the closer they got to\u00a0Qudu, the more obvious the intent for their troop deployment was.\u201d\u201cBreaching\u00a0Qudu\u00a0was not at all a good choice.\u00a0Qudu\u00a0is the heart of Dazhou. Stay here for too long, and they would end up trapped in a three-way siege from the Libei Armored Cavalry, Qidong Five Commanderies Garrison Troops, and the Eight Great Training Divisions.\u201d Shen Zechuan lowered his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve never believed that the Biansha Cavalry wanted to attack\u00a0Qudu.\u201d\u201cYou are too smart.\u201d Xiao Chiye praised him. He slid Shen Zechuan\u2019s finger across the entire map and pointed to Juexi at the westernmost part. \u201cI think they wanted to head here. Juexi faces the sea. It has two major harbors and three major grain reserves prefectures. All the military provisions from Libei,\u00a0Qudu, and Qidong come from here. As long as they entered within Juexi\u2019s boundary, they wouldn\u2019t even need to attack and take down the cities and towns and they would already have all three parties by the throats.\u201d\u201cIf there were no inside help, then this would be a flight of fancy.\u201d Shen Zechuan pondered over it and said.\u201cIt\u2019s just a straight line from east to west from Zhongbo to Juexi. Crossing through Zhongbo is the shortest route. Shen Wei opened the gates for them and gave them the courage and provisions to continue further in. Without the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path,\u00a0dage\u00a0would not be able to send troops for at least another seven days. Seven days. If the Eight Great Training Divisions failed to defend\u00a0Qudu, then the Biansha Cavalry would have already arrived at Yongyi Harbor.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThis was one reason for Libei\u2019s wrath. There is no room for blatant disregard of ethics in the face of the enemy\u2019s forces. We can forgive Shen Wei for the defeat of his troops, but we will never forgive Shen Wei for this stab in the back.\u201dShen Zechuan suddenly turned his head and looked at Xiao Chiye in close proximity.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Xiao Chiye did not intend to release him.\u201cShen Wei colluded with the enemies,\u201d Shen Zechuan revealed an odd smile. \u201cShen Wei colluded with the enemy\u2026 The Twelve Tribes of Biansha wanted to attack Juexi. But where did Shen Wei get his hands on Juexi\u2019s military map?\u201d\u201cThe Ministry of War has it.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cMoney makes the mare go. Bribe them heavily, and you can buy it.\u201d\u201cIn that case,\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201c\u2026 anyone else beside Shen Wei could have done it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 : Night Chat\u201cThat may be so.\u201d Xiao Chiye lowered his eyes, \u201cBut the one directly connected to the success or failure on the frontline was Shen Wei.\u201dThe expression in his eyes looked particularly tender and loving when he lowered them this way. The brilliance from earlier had yet to dissipate. It shimmered in his eyes, like fireflies in the night.Shen Zechuan looked at him for a moment and said, \u201cThe Ministry of War has no personnel transfer these years.\u201d\u201cInvestigate if you want to.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cI won\u2019t stop you.\u201d\u201cOf course you won\u2019t.\u201d Shen Zechuan shifted his gaze back to the book. \u201cBecause you want to investigate too. The most obvious suspect should have been the Hua Clan, but Shen Wei was already a tainted blade. There are thousands of simpler ways to dispose of him. Involving too many people would only just make it easier to leave behind a trail that could be used against them.\u201d\u201cYou killed Ji Lei, no?\u201d Xiao Chiye smiled. \u201cHe should have given you plenty of information. There is no fun in hiding it away, is there? Lay it out on the table so that we can speculate together.\u201d\u201cI know everything you have said, yet what I\u2019ll be saying is known only to me.\u201d Shen Zechuan extracted his hand bit by bit. \u201cIt\u2019s really too unfair a trade.\u201dXiao Chiye thought for a moment, then said, \u201cHow about this then? We\u2019ll do a one-for-one exchange.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cYou go first.\u201dMaking use of his height, Xiao Chiye barricaded Shen Zechuan at the side of the bookshelf and raised a hand to flip through the pages at random. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know the rules? Secrets have to be said on the quiet.\u201dShen Zechuan leaned forward and said, \u201cSaid on the quiet, not said while sticking together.\u201d\u201cWhat if the walls have ears?\u201d Xiao Chiye put the book back, propped up his arm, and smiled at him. \u201cAfter all, I\u2019ve only just bought this compound. I have yet to acquaint myself with it that well. It\u2019s better to exercise caution.\u201d\u201cXiao\u2019Er.\u201d Shen Zechuan looked at the book. \u201cYou\u2019re truly an asshole.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cBut what can you do? Alright, I\u2019m going to start.\u201dShen Zechuan waited for a moment but did not hear any sound. The moment he turned his head, he realized that Xiao Chiye was still looking at him.It was only when both men\u2019s breathing intersected that Xiao Chiye said, \u201cShen Wei didn\u2019t set himself on fire. The fire at the Prince of Jianxing Manor was set by the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. The one who went there with the orders was Ji Lei. You know that, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Shen Zechuan said calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret.\u201dLIANYIN @ CANGJI.NET\u201cThen, do you know the real reason for the fall of Duanzhou?\u201d Xiao Chiye asked.Shen Zechuan could not turn his eyes away. He could not even take his time to ponder over it. Because the instant he could not keep up with Xiao Chiye\u2019s train of thought, he would easily fall into the other party\u2019s trap.Shen Zechuan said, \u201cWhen the Chashi River was attacked, Shen Wei ordered the Duanzhou Garrison Troops to retreat, leaving behind the\u00a0Hereditary Prince, Shen Zhouji, to head over to Chashi River to provide support. Shen Zhouji was cut from the same cloth as his old man. He abandoned the Chashi River soldiers and took his own bodyguards to flee right before the battle, but he was dragged through the public road to his death on the same day itself by the Biansha Cavalry. With Shen Zhouji\u2019s death, the Chashi River\u2019s morale took a beating. After the soldiers were massacred, Duanzhou no longer had any military forces to stand before them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cBut there\u2019s one thing you don\u2019t know. While Shen Zhouji was still alive, he worked with Shen Wei to strangle the Commander of the Duanzhou Garrison Troops, Tantai Long, to death.\u201dTantai Long. Tantai Hu!No wonder Tantai Hu said that his own brother had been in the Chashi Sinkhole too.Shen Zechuan frowned and asked, \u201cStrangled to death?\u201d\u201cBecause Tantai Long insisted on deploying troops to meet the enemy head-on. He repeatedly contradicted Shen Wei in public. After Shen Wei\u2019s withdrawal order was issued, Tantai Long defied the command and refused to obey. So Shen Wei pretended to make amends with wine. After the drink, he joined forces with Shen Zhouji to strangle Tantai Long to death in his room.\u201d Xiao Chiye paused. \u201cLaohu\u00a0doesn\u2019t know. He thought Tantai Long was killed in battle. And this is the first matter I\u2019m telling you. Your turn.\u201dShen Zechuan quickly sorted out his thoughts and said, \u201cShen Wei was a participant in the struggle for the throne and carried out assassinations for the Empress Dowager. Afterward, he was closely watched by the Empress Dowager. Sensing danger, he bribed Pan Rugui and went to Zhongbo.\u201d\u201cOne mustn\u2019t lay a hand on one\u2019s watchdog.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cUnder normal situations, the Hua Clan would not choose this kind of risky way to take down Shen Wei. There is no benefit to the Empress Dowager, who is already in control of Dazhou\u2019s administration and governmental affairs. The demand for money after the battle far exceeded the availability in Dazhou\u2019s Treasury. The Empress Dowager still wants to be the Grand Emperor1\u00a0behind the screen.2\u00a0Doing so would be detrimental to herself. Shen Wei wasn\u2019t worth the price.\u201dShen Zechuan gave a slight nod of his head and said, \u201cSo whatever Ji Lei said might not necessarily be entirely right, because he himself was just a pawn too. If you want to investigate this matter, you have to start from the Ministry of War, which could lead you either way to the top or bottom.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cI\u2019ll investigate the top. You investigate the bottom.\u201d\u201cTop and bottom are all linked; they are inseparable.\u201d It was only when Shen Zechuan spoke to this point that he realized that Xiao Chiye was making a pass at him. He flipped through the book and feigned obliviousness.With a hint of a smile, Xiao Chiye stepped aside and said, \u201cTake a seat.\u201dIt was hot inside the house. Xiao Chiye was dressed in a scarlet court robe3\u00a0with an embroidered lion.4\u00a0He was now a bona fide Second-Grade5\u00a0Viceroy of two armies in\u00a0Qudu. Presumably, he had headed straight here after leaving the palace and had yet to change out of his attire. His facial features were all the more dashing set against the contrast of his outfit as he sat in the chair; it had even dismissed the frivolous air around him.Both men faced each other across the table. Xiao Chiye looked on as Shen Zechuan read the book. He did not even bother to hide it now, and that undisguised interest of his circled Shen Zechuan\u2019s neck and settled on Shen Zechuan\u2019s hands. He was no longer fixated on one spot; he wanted to see all of Shen Zechuan\u2019s body.Shen Zechuan\u2019s fingers would bend when he reached out to flip the pages. This made Xiao Chiye think of a different moment when Shen Zechuan\u2019s fingers \u2013 slicked with hot, damp sweat \u2013 would also curl up like this to grip the bedding even as they rocked like the surging waves.Shen Zechuan felt as though his fingers were still being grasped and played with in a certain man\u2019s palms. Feeling restless out of the blue, he closed the book and looked right at Xiao Chiye.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cHm?\u201dShen Zechuan slightly clasped his fingers together and said with a curve of his lips, \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0is bogged down with tasks lately. I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t have the time to investigate other matters.\u201dXiao Chiye twirled his thumb ring around and said, \u201cBeing busy is just temporary. If the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0have the time to spare, they can share our\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s worries and help with our problems.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just a mere soldier. I have no official post, nor do I enjoy the trust and favor of the Emperor. How could I command the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards?\u201d Shen Zechuan leaned back slightly against the back of the chair. \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0has to manage patrols in\u00a0Qudu, as well as private cases of the Imperial Court. They have to be prudent in everything they do, while the Viceroy has to go to great pains and expend great effort. It isn\u2019t easy.\u201dXiao Chiye was truly busy now that he had suppressed the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. He could read the provocation in Shen Zechuan\u2019s words. So he laced his fingers, set them right before Shen Zechuan, and said with certainty, \u201cYou want to create trouble for me.\u201d\u201cTit-for-tat.\u201d Shen Zechuan said mildly. \u201cYou intercepted all my duties, thereby giving me free time. Naturally, I have to thank you properly.\u201d\u201cThere are so many ways to express your thanks. Why not choose one that would delight everyone?\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cLooks like you indeed have friends in the Six Ministries.\u201d\u201cHaving money at home is not as good as having friends in the Imperial Court. My friend told me something. I guess you\u2019d be interested too.\u201d Shen Zechuan said.Xiao Chiye stared at him and said, \u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201dBut Shen Zechuan surveyed the study and said, \u201cCome to think of it, it\u2019s a pity that I have yet to meet this \u2018Unpolished Jade Yuanzhuo\u2019,6\u00a0Yao Wenyu. Are you on good terms with him?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cA passing acquaintance. He can\u2019t be compared to you.\u201d\u201cThe Yao Clan is on the decline, yet they still stand among the\u00a0Eight Great Clans. It\u2019s inevitable that there would be people who can\u2019t accept this.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cYao Wenyu is Secretariat Elder Hai\u2019s pupil, yet he doesn\u2019t join the Imperial Court as an official. This is just like throwing away his weapon to let others slaughter him as they please.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cEven though the Yao Clan seems to be on the decline on the surface, the remnants of power and prestige accumulated over three reigns are still there. Yao Wenyu might be a refined man of leisure, but he is by no means a fool. Who would want to mess with the Yao Clan?\u201dShen Zechuan put on a contemplative expression and said, \u201cHow would I know about that?\u201dXiao Chiye fell silent, but he reacted quickly and said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t that generous a person. By going out of your way to give me news, you\u2019ve instead made me uneasy, Lanzhou.\u201d\u201cWe are going to investigate the case together. Anything I can help with, I\u2019ll not decline to.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cIt\u2019s only when I saw you on good terms with the Yao Clan that I remembered this. The\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0have stood tall for a very long time. Seeing how powerful and mighty you are now, wouldn\u2019t it only to be expected if they were to be scheming something? If the Yao Clan isn\u2019t willing to associate with them, then they would inevitably become the target of their ire.\u201dXiao Chiye took over command of the Eight Great Training Divisions and upset the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u2019 military power. All along, the Eight Great Training Divisions were the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u2019 assets for contingency purposes that circled around\u00a0Qudu. Losing an official post was nothing; they still had the younger generations at home to replace them. But losing the Eight Great Training Divisions meant that they would fall under the control of others for real. It was one thing for them to mutually contain one another, and another to be controlled by Xiao Chiye. As the saying goes, it\u2019s a general truism of the world that anything long divided will surely unite, and anything long united will surely divide.7\u00a0And now, Xiao Chiye was the common foe the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0had to reunite again to deal with.What Shen Zechuan had said was not wrong, but Xiao Chiye could still smell something fishy about these seemingly honest words.Xiao Chiye said without batting an eyelid, \u201cThe threat I pose to them hasn\u2019t reached that extent yet.\u201d\u201cThe permanent solution would be to nip it in the bud. You have already displayed your abilities during the Autumn Hunt. Pretending that nothing had happened now is merely deceiving yourself, much like plugging your ears while stealing a bell.\u201d Shen Zechuan said.Xiao Chiye suddenly asked, \u201cWho\u2019s your friend?\u201dLIANYIN @ CANGJI.NETShen Zechuan smiled at him and said, \u201cEven if I tell you the truth, would you dare to believe it?\u201dXiao Chiye stared restlessly at Shen Zechuan.He wouldn\u2019t believe him.Shen Zechuan was good at bewitching others. Every word he said while he was sober was a cocktail of truths and lies. This man was so difficult to deal with that Xiao Chiye even felt that he was much easier to talk to in bed.\u201cI\u2019ll ferret him out.\u201d Xiao Chiye leaned closer to him. \u201cYou only need to expose your trail, and you won\u2019t be able to escape my eyes.\u201d\u201cYou are already about to be unable to fend for yourself.\u201d Shen Zechuan said cheerfully. \u201cYou\u2019d best think of a way first to ride out this storm safely.\u201d\u201cTo think your heart doesn\u2019t even ache for me at all.\u201d Xiao Chiye suddenly made a switch away from his solemn expression. \u201cOne night together as husband and wife is affection for a hundred more.8\u00a0Lanzhou, you are too callous.\u201dShen Zechuan imitated his previous words and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. But what can you do?\u201dXiao Chiye sat down and propped up his leg again. Reclining back against the chair, he pondered for a moment and said, \u201cThis matter is an easy one to resolve. It\u2019s not really that big of a deal. I\u2019ll have to thank you for your reminder tonight.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s really too kind of you.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cOne hundred taels will do.\u201d\u201cNo money.\u201d Xiao Chiye dragged out his words. \u201cMy annual salary as a second-grade official is only one hundred and fifty taels. But even without money, I can use something else in exchange. This Second Young Master will warm your bed for you.\u201d\u201cThen forget it.\u201d Shen Zechuan smiled politely. \u201cI\u2019m used to sleeping alone. I don\u2019t need to warm my bed.\u201d\u201cHabits can be changed.\u201d Xiao Chiye lifted his fingers to his nose to take a sniff. Casting a sidelong glance at him, he jested, \u201cAre you getting used to sniffing my handkerchief so far?\u201dCaught off-guard, Shen Zechuan clenched his hands, leaving red marks on his fingertips.Xiao Chiye sized up the beauty under the lantern. He looked as the latter forcibly braced himself to put on a calm front, then at his reddened fingertips. Finally, he pointed to his own ear and said in a wicked tone, \u201cLanzhou, you\u2019re blushing.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 : New BladeBlush.Shen Zechuan\u2019s heart was originally as still as deep waters, but at this moment, even he was shaken by that word. Xiao Chiye\u2019s handkerchief, which lay in his sleeve pocket, was like a fire that had been stuffed within. It inexplicably obeyed Xiao Chiye\u2019s commands and sent the flames burning all the way up to his ears. He knew that the slight redness flushed on the snowy paleness of his skin was particularly striking. Even if he denied it, it would convince no one.He seemed to be caught by Xiao Chiye in a certain predicament where bright mirrors surrounded them on all sides. The way Xiao Chiye looked was as if he wanted his true colors to be revealed, and his protective shell to be cast aside.Shen Zechuan licked his lips to get rid of the troubling dryness. He balled up his fists and ignored such a provocation from Xiao Chiye, refusing to give Xiao Chiye a chance to pry further.\u201cIt\u2019s time to sleep.\u201d Shen Zechuan declared, \u201cLet\u2019s call for them.\u201dXiao Chiye felt Shen Zechuan\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m ignoring you\u201d reaction to be like a scratch that tickled him so suggestively that it stirred up his desire to press home the attack after his victory. However, if he were to emerge victorious, he could not rush it; impulsiveness would only make it easy for him to fall into traps. So he let him off this time and said, \u201cBoth\u00a0shifu\u00a0have their own arrangements, so there\u2019s no need to worry about them. If you want to sleep, the East Wing has been vacated.\u201dShen Zechuan stood up right away.Ji Gang and Zuo Qianqiu were so dead drunk that they were still not sober the next day. Shen Zechuan carried Ji Gang onto the carriage and took him back.Xiao Chiye watched the carriage ride away and said to Chen Yang, \u201cKeep your eyes closely on the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0these two days. See who\u2019s on the move.\u201dChen Yang nodded in acknowledgment of his order.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Accompanied by the swaying of the carriage, Shen Zechuan closed his eyes and rested. The carriage made a detour, and midway through the journey, they swapped to an unremarkable horse-cart before arriving at Zhao Zui Temple.Qiao Tianya carried Ji Gang on his back and followed Shen Zechuan into the courtyard. Ge Qingqing had been waiting for a long while. When he saw them, he hurriedly stepped forward to receive them.\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Shen Zechuan assured. \u201cShifu\u00a0is just drunk.\u201dGrand Mentor Qi, who was standing under the eaves, instructed, \u201cQingqing, help Ji Gang inside and let him sleep it off.\u201dGe Qingqing took Ji Gang from Shen Zechuan and carried him into the house.Qiao Tianya strode forward in a few steps, went on his knees in the snow, and asked, \u201cHas Grand Mentor been doing well?\u201d\u201cAll is well upon seeing you.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi lifted his hand and said, \u201cNow that you have already changed your name to Qiao Tianya, that indenture1\u00a0is no longer of any use, yet you are willing to stay for that bit of sentiment. I should thank you.\u201d\u201cTo Grand Mentor Qi, what happened in the past was merely an effortless lift of your finger. But to me, it was a kindness that saved my life.\u201d The merriment on Qiao Tianya\u2019s face vanished. He added, \u201cDuring the year of Yongyi,2\u00a0when Emperor Guangcheng had corrupt officials killed, my father and brother were both framed by others. If Grand Mentor had not been judicious and discerning enough to offer a helping hand, the twenty lives of the Qiao Clan would have died unjust deaths before the Meridian Gate.\u201d3\u201cYour father and brother were both honest and upright subjects. It was just a brief moment of misjudgment that they were wrongly accused. Even without me, they would still be safe and sound.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi replied.Qiao Tianya paused for a long while before he professed, \u201cThe Qiao Clan cannot thank Grand Mentor enough for his kindness.\u201dDuring the years of Yongyi, when Qiao Tianya\u2019s father still served as an official in the Ministry of War, Emperor Guangcheng was tough on corruption. Senior Qiao, having been reported by others, was found by the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0to be in the possession of properties and lands of unidentified origins. While he was helpless against accusations, Qi Huilian re-investigated the case and freed Senior Qiao and a few others from the Ministry of War. Consequently, Qi Huilian married off his daughter to the eldest son of the Qiaos. Yet, this was not the end of the matter; a few years later, the Eastern Palace was falsely accused, and Qi Huilian was demoted from the Grand Mentor to a commoner. The same time when he followed the Crown Prince into Zhao Zui Temple, Senior Qiao defected to the Empress Dowager.The Eastern Palace fell. Empress Dowager Hua had its remnants thoroughly investigated using Pan Rugui\u2019s authority of office in endorsing memorials4\u00a0and Emperor Guangcheng\u2019s name. As a result, Senior Qiao was thrown into prison again. This time, without Grand Mentor Qi as his guarantor, both he and his eldest son were beheaded. The rest of the Qiao household were banished to Suotian Pass. Qi Huilian\u2019s daughter died on the way. She was Qiao Tianya\u2019s eldest sister-in-law.\u201cLet us not bring up the past,\u201d Grand Mentor Qi tugged on his snow-white hair and spoke, \u201cIt was not easy for you to be freed of the underclass status.5\u00a0But you must think it through: once you become subjected to Lanzhou, it will be a lifelong commitment. You will no longer be in control of your life or death.\u201dQiao Tianya\u2019s hair fluttered in the wind; his smile was unruly and unrestrained. He said, \u201cGrand Mentor, I already have no home to return to. In this lifetime, I\u2019ve repeatedly received favors from both you and Eldest Sister-in-law. These were originally sinful debts that I had no way of repaying. Now that I can be of use, I shall dedicate my life to Master. Qiao Songyue died with Eldest Sister-in-law in the Cang Commandery. The Qiao Tianya of today is merely a blade. There is no life nor death, let alone freedom, in a blade. Since this is a dark time when evil powers hang over us like overcast clouds that make the road you walk difficult, then pull out this blade that is myself and use it as you please.\u201dGrand Mentor Qi slowly walked out. Holding the pillar for support, he looked towards Shen Zechuan and said, \u201cLanzhou, this year is about to end. Teacher has yet to give you a gift for your coming-of-age.\u201d6Shen Zechuan\u2019s sleeves were blown apart by the breeze. He had a feeling of what was to come.Grand Mentor Qi said, \u201cYou can face everything head-on by yourself now. But this road will be long: killing the sworn enemies, demolishing the\u00a0Eight Great Clans, overturning the past trials, and bringing peace to Zhongbo. None of it is easy. Ji Gang will give you a blade, so will I. Receive it well.\u201dFlurries of snow drifted down in the inner court. Shen Zechuan lowered his head and let Grand Mentor Qi lay cold fingers on top of his hair.Ji Gang woke up when it was time for dinner. He had some congee before he called Shen Zechuan into the house.\u201cDo you still remember the blade I mentioned to you the last time? It was delivered last night. It\u2019s been on my mind since.\u201d Ji Gang shifted aside the shelf inside the house to reveal a blade stand in the back.The first time Shen Zechuan saw this blade, his heart stirred. He could no longer move his eyes away.\u201cJi Lei cannot use it.\u201d Ji Gang used a clean handkerchief to wipe at the blade\u2019s edge slowly, \u201cBut this blade suits you very well. I had someone re-forge the sheath. Its past name cannot be used anymore; you should give it another name yourself.\u201dStill engrossed in the blade\u2019s luster, Shen Zechuan studied it with fascination.The straight blade of almost three and seven tenth\u00a0chi7\u00a0meant that its unsheathing had to be sufficiently fast. Its width of two fingers would make swift attacks especially easy to maneuver. The hilt, made of sandalwood, was also newly forged. There was no decorative carving on it. Only the top was plated in gold with a white pearl embedded within.This was an excellent blade that had been thoroughly tempered. Even after having been shelved and forgotten for so long, it still cut an imposing, grim presence when unsheathed. It was as if it were immersed in the clear waters of autumn; not only was it pristine and untainted, but it also carried with it an air of solitary haughtiness.\u201cShifu\u00a0has recently been pondering over a matter. It was only when I saw\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0last night that I realized I have been too inflexible in my teachings that you have become a little too overcautious and hesitant.\u201d Ji Gang laid down the handkerchief and said, \u201cOnce you wield this blade, even\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u2019s\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0will not be able to match its speed. The sandalwood hilt is sufficiently light and will allow you to be more agile. Of all martial arts in this world, speed is the only thing that cannot be defeated. This is my father\u2019s beloved blade. When it comes to the Ji Clan\u2019s martial arts, we now say that one has to be firm and ferocious. But the Ji Clan\u2019s mental technique was founded and created by my father. What worked for him will surely work for you. You can take a different approach and blaze out a new trail as well.\u201dShen Zechuan held the hilt of the blade and lifted it.\u201cGive it a name.\u201d Ji Gang retreated several steps aside.Shen Zechuan held it lovingly, unwilling to let go, and asked, \u201cShifu\u00a0would give me a blade of this caliber?\u201dJi Gang laughed heartily and said, \u201cShifu\u00a0wants to box. I don\u2019t like using blades. This blade would be wasted if I didn\u2019t give it to you.\u201dShen Zechuan thought for a while, then said, \u201cThen I shall change its name to \u2018Yang Shan Xue\u2019.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8In the evening, Grand Mentor Qi sat on his heels across the table. He wrote down the surnames of all the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0on a piece of paper.\u201cIt will soon be the Feast of A Hundred Officials. The Four Great Generals will soon be reunited, and the regional officials will be returning as well.\u201d Letting the ink dry, Grand Mentor Qi spoke, \u201cWith the ascension of the new Emperor, there will surely be \u2018surveillance\u2019 next year. This matter is of utmost importance and is tied to the political stability during the year of Xianyang. Everyone will use the Feast of a Hundred Officials and the annual leave as an opportunity to reassess the situation in court. If Empress Dowager wants to stage a comeback and return to power, she will definitely not let this opportunity slip.\u201d\u201cAfter the death of Hua Siqian, the Empress Dowager has been restrained inside the Palace and has not shown her face since. The younger generation of the Hua Clan has been demoted and banished. If she wants to make a move now, she could only use external help.\u201d Shen Zechuan furrowed his brows. \u201cBut with the failing precedence of Xi Gu\u2019an, who would still dare to act rashly and be the Empress Dowager\u2019s accomplice?\u201d\u201cCowardly rats will not achieve greatness. All collaborations in this world are motivated by mutual benefits. As long as the Empress Dowager still holds the bargaining chips, why would she worry about finding a new ship to board?\u201d Grand Mentor Qi drew a few strokes under \u201cHua\u201d on the paper, and continued, \u201cMoreover, the men in her clan cannot be depended on. You\u2019ve forgotten: it is a woman that the Empress Dowager has been personally mentoring.\u201d\u201cThe Third Missy.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cTeacher is referring to Hua Xiangyi.\u201d\u201cGiven the height of her favors while Emperor Xiande was still alive, Hua the Third was going to be conferred the title of Princess of Dazhou.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi said, \u201cBut she eventually did not become the Princess of Dazhou. It was not because Emperor Xiande was stingy, but because the Empress Dowager would not allow it.\u201dShen Zechuan sipped a mouthful of tea and contemplated for a moment. Swallowing the tea, he said, \u201cI understand now.\u201d\u201cThen let us hear your thoughts on it.\u201dShen Zechuan propped his arm on his knee and said, \u201cIf Hua Xiangyi had become the Princess of Dazhou, then her marriage would be out of the Empress Dowager\u2019s hands. The marriage of a princess is a state affair, subject to the discretionary choice of the Emperor and the court officials. But if she remains as the Third Missy, then only the Empress Dowager has a say in whom she will be married off to. In that case, Teacher, does the Empress Dowager want to marry her off?\u201d\u201cIf the mountain does not come to me, then I will go to the mountain.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi dipped his brush in ink. \u201cThe Empress Dowager has forsaken a chariot to save the general.8\u00a0Losing Xi Gu\u2019an means that she has lost control of military power in\u00a0Qudu; but if Hua Xiangyi marries Xiao Chiye, then this matter will be easily resolved.\u201dShen Zechuan lightly tapped on his teacup. Holding the cup, he lowered his eyes and said, \u201cThis is harder than ascending the heavens.\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0will never hand over his power.\u201d\u201cI have heard that Hua Xiangyi\u2019s beauty could make an entire city swoon. There is no guarantee that\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0would not change his mind if lust overcomes him.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi commented pointedly.Shen Zechuan held a mouthful of tea in his mouth and did not say a word.Grand Mentor Qi said, \u201cBut this is indeed not easy to do. Even if\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0had the heart to do so, Xiao Jiming would not sit idly and let him. The Hua Clan and the Xiao Clan are like fire and water who cannot mix; there is no reason to bury the hatchet and make peace when the advantage is on their side.\u201dShen Zechuan gave it some thought and said, \u201cLosing military power but having the central administration in his control is a good choice as well. But at this time, there are barely any exceptional up-and-coming officials. Hai Liangyi still heads the Grand Secretariat, and the Empress Dowager cannot lower Hua Xiangyi\u2019s status and have her become a concubine. Then, there is no other fitting candidate for a groom in all of\u00a0Qudu.\u201d\u201cIf there isn\u2019t any in\u00a0Qudu, she can look elsewhere,\u201d Grand Mentor Qi wrote the word \u201cQidong\u201d and said, \u201cLibei won\u2019t do, but there is still an opportunity in Qidong.\u201d\u201cCommander Qi and Lu Guangbai have both yet to marry.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cThen it can only be Lu Guangbai. However, the Lu Clan are longtime close friends with the Xiao Clan. Theirs is by no means a relationship one can drive a wedge between overnight.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you put your guess on the Qi Clan?\u201d Grand Mentor Qi said with dissatisfaction. \u201cOther than Qi Zhuyin, the Qi Clan still has one more person.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d Shen Zechuan looked astonished.A few days later, Xiao Chiye accompanied Li Jianheng outside the city to welcome the two Qidong Commanders-in-Chief. Lu Guangbai returned with him. On the way, he removed his helmet and said, \u201cI heard some news during the journey. Do you know about it?\u201dXiao Chiye spurred his horse forward and asked, \u201cWhat?\u201dBefore Lu Guangbai got his chance to speak, Qi Zhuyin spurred her horse towards them from behind and slapped him on the back.\u201cCommander!\u201d Lu Guangbai yelled in pain.Qi Zhuyin rarely looked unhappy. She grabbed her blade and leaned forward to ask Xiao Chiye, \u201cWhen did these rumors spread in\u00a0Qudu?\u201dXiao Chiye was even more confused.Qi Zhuyin clenched her teeth and fumed, \u201cSomeone is going to be my stepmother.\u201d9Stunned, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cOld Commander Qi wants to take a new concubine?\u201d\u201cConcubine.\u201d Qi Zhuyin sneered derisively, \u201cThey\u2019re already saying that he\u2019s going to take a second wife! Third Missy Hua is going to be my stepmother. Is she even my age?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 : BanquetHua Xiangyi was indeed not as old as Qi Zhuyin. She was younger than Qi Zhuyin by two years. Having been kept deep in the inner palace these days, she had thinned down a lot. Realization dawned on her when she saw Qi Shiyu\u2019s portrait on the table in front of the Empress Dowager.The Empress Dowager held her hand and grasped it for a long time before saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a May-December marriage, but Qi Shiyu will still dote on you.\u201dHua Xiangyi touched the purple palace robe and laid her head on the Empress Dowager\u2019s knee. The Empress Dowager stroked her long hair and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to feel aggrieved. All of Hua Clan\u2019s daughters are married away like this. A few years after you marry him, you will become the bonafide mistress of the Qidong Five Commanderies.\u201dAfter lighting the incense in the palace hall, Matron Liuxiang wordlessly motioned for all the maids and eunuchs to leave.Hua Xiangyi smiled and said, \u201cI just can\u2019t bear to leave you, aunt. Cangjun Commandery is so far away; I\u2019ll have to wait a year if I wish to see you again.\u201d\u201cAunt can\u2019t bear to leave you either.\u201d The Empress Dowager hugged her gently. Hua Xiangyi snuggled against her like she did when she was little, listening as the Empress Dowager said, \u201cWhen I married Emperor Guangcheng, I was only fifteen. That year I left Dicheng, the one thing I couldn\u2019t bear parting with the most was my family\u2019s swing. I liked sitting on it. With each swing in the wind, I could hear the clamor beyond those high walls. My mother coaxed me and told me that after I came to the Imperial Palace of\u00a0Qudu, the Emperor would build me an identical swing as long as I wanted it.\u201dHua Xiangyi stayed still and silent.The Empress Dowager was the person most favored by Emperor Guangcheng, yet what Emperor Guangcheng gave was not what the Empress Dowager wanted. The moment she set foot into\u00a0Qudu, she discovered that all the doting her husband showered on her was merely fleeting, like the clouds in the sky. She had to vie endlessly with countless women in the harem just for that one moment of joy.In\u00a0Qudu, the most worthless thing of all was love.The Empress Dowager patted Hua Xiangyi\u2019s head and said, \u201cSince I came to\u00a0Qudu, thirty-seven years have already passed by in a blink. Now my little baby niece is also to be wedded. I\u2019ve really grown old. In\u00a0Qudu, I realized that men are powerful in this world because they can take the imperial exams and serve as officials to rise in rank; they can also ride horses into battles whilst wielding spears. Us women are taken into lady\u2019s chambers and taught virtue and precepts. No matter how talented and intelligent you are with a thirst for knowledge, there will come a time when you have to eventually marry.\u201dThe Empress Dowager\u2019s eyes were calm.\u201cWhen Father taught me, he said that in this world, he and the Emperor would be the sky above my head. How ridiculously funny. Becoming the Empress means that I share the empire equally with the Emperor. Who could be the sky above my head? No one! My brothers at home are all useless and muddleheaded. Generation after generation, the Hua Clan can only rely on marrying off daughters to keep up the appearance of an affluent clan; yet we aren\u2019t allowed to make a single complaint. What kind of kinship is this? Since the world wants to differentiate between the strong and weak to determine success and failure, then I, too, can emerge victor.\u201dThe Empress Dowager stroked Hua Xiangyi\u2019s temples.\u201cRemember this: this time, it is not Qi Shiyu who chose you but you who chose him. I may be defeated in the days to come, but it certainly won\u2019t be now. My baby niece is going to Qidong not because there is no other option, but to bide your time and ready yourself for action. No matter what happens in the future, you may sigh, but you must never wallow in self-resentment and self-pity. In this game of chess with the world at stake, one can only make a move with no regrets. Since we are surrounded and eyed by a pack of wolves with no way of escape, then we shall fight them to the bitter end.\u201dThe bamboo tube in the palace hall swung lightly. Hua Xiangyi slowly grasped the Empress Dowager\u2019s hand back.\u201cI will not forget Aunt\u2019s teachings.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8The Feast of A Hundred Officials was on Yuanchun1\u00a0night. Local officials entered the capital one after another. There were a lot fewer family feasts and banquets this year, as they all knew that Hai Liangyi was keeping a close watch on them. Even coming together in great numbers could turn into evidence of clique forming. It had not been long since Li Jianheng\u2019s ascension to the throne. Everyone all wanted to use the Feast of A Hundred Officials as an opportunity to observe this new master of theirs.They still did not know which way the wind was blowing in\u00a0Qudu, so everyone spoke and acted with prudence. Only the matter of Hua the Third spread like wildfire, leaving Qi Zhuyin with nowhere else to vent her unhappiness.Xiao Chiye was still secretly investigating the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0in recent days, but this matter had also piqued his interest. It just happened that Xiao Jiming had entered the capital, so both brothers had a chat in the residence.\u201cThe Hua Clan wants to rise again from the ashes. No matter how much of a lecher Old Commander Qi is, he must not agree to this marriage.\u201d Xiao Chiye said off-handedly as he took out Libei Armored Cavalry\u2019s current year expenditure accounts for a look.\u201cThat\u2019s really hard to say.\u201d Xiao Jiming sat at the table and flipped through the military affairs.Xiao Chiye raised his eyes and asked, \u201cHow would this benefit his Qidong?\u201dXiao Jiming endorsed the document with his name and said, \u201cYou\u2019re in\u00a0Qudu, and you have taken over the Eight Great Training Divisions. Haven\u2019t you checked the Eight Great Training Divisions\u2019 accounts?\u201dXiao Chiye responded, \u201cI took a look at the account when the Court of Judicial Review was purged. The surplus money and military provisions from the Eight Great Training Divisions were all supplied to the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0this year to make up for the shortfall. What\u2019s wrong?\u201dXiao Jiming pondered over the document for a moment and said, \u201cWhen Hua Siqian was still alive, the annual salary and provisions for the Eight Great Training Division was several times higher than that of the Bianjun Commandery. The money that Xi Gu\u2019an couldn\u2019t account for\u2014Where could it have gone? Since Hua Siqian could have two accounts for one payment, then couldn\u2019t the Empress Dowager have kept another account book? Money comes and goes like flowing water, but the audit remains a constant. As long as he could swap the auditing official to his own and place the said official right under the Eight Great Training Divisions\u2019 noses, they could write the account book in any way they so desire every year. The Hua Clan\u2019s properties have been searched and their possessions, confiscated. But who would dare to touch the Empress Dowager\u2019s private coffers? This money is now Hua Xiangyi\u2019s dowry. Whether it\u2019s for official or personal reasons, Qi Shiyu ought to be tempted.\u201dLooking displeased, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThe current commander-in-chief of Qidong Five Commanderies\u2019 military forces is Qi Zhuyin. Qi Zhuyin will not agree to it.\u201d\u201cEven so.\u201d Xiao Jiming finally looked at Xiao Chiye. \u201cShe can\u2019t stop it.\u201dXiao Chiye lay down and thought for a while before saying, \u201cAll these years, the Qi Clan has had a pretty good relationship with us. If Qi Shiyu really marries Hua the Third, Libei will no longer be Qidong\u2019s buddy.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s of little importance. Once the Biansha Twelve Tribes come attacking, everyone still has to fight side by side.\u201d Xiao Jiming said, \u201cWith Hua the Third, the Qidong Five Commanderies\u2019 Garrison Troops will have money.\u201d\u201cThen tell them to buy Libei\u2019s horses in the future.\u201d There was a cold, tough glint in Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow long can the Empress Dowager\u2019s private coffer last? Providing for 200,000 soldiers is not as simple as raising 20 dogs. The consumption of military expenditure is alarming. It\u2019s definitely not something a single person can sustain.\u201d\u201cIf the Empress Dowager has the Qi Clan to assist her, then the impasse in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0can be broken.\u201d Xiao Jiming said, \u201cOnce power returns to her hand, she will be able to recoup the money.\u201dXiao Chiye sat up again and said, \u201cThis marriage must not come to pass.\u201dXiao Jiming said, \u201cThere\u2019s still a way.\u201dXiao Chiye looked towards him and said, \u201cThe easiest is to kill Hua the Third.\u201dXiao Jiming looked at him in surprise and said, \u201cYou are also a thorn in others\u2019 flesh now. The Eight Great Clan will only be too anxious for you to make a move.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cRumors are rife now. If we try to stop it after the new year, it\u2019d be too late.\u201dXiao Jiming pondered it over in silence. After a while, he said, \u201cIf the Empress Dowager wants to put this marriage together, then she must show herself, and the Feast of A Hundred Officials is her only opportunity. This matter is of great importance. Hai Liangyi might not necessarily be willing to let it happen. When the time comes, there will be a war of words.\u201d\u201cThe Hua clan has three generations of daughters who were married away to Qidong. If we were to delve into it seriously, then Hua the Third might really turn out to be Qi Shiyu\u2019s distant blood relative.\u201d Xiao Chiye set aside the book and suddenly burst out laughing. \u201cNo\u2026 I want Hua the Third to become a distant blood relative of Qi Shiyu. This marriage must not come to pass.\u201dXiao Chiye got up and pushed the door open to call for Zhao Hui.\u201cIt\u2019s the Spring Festival.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cYou still have yet to see your younger sister.\u201dZhao Hui looked at Xiao Jiming, who smiled faintly.Zhao Hui understood and said, \u201cI\u2019ll pay her a visit tomorrow morning.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Han Cheng, the new Commander-in-chief of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, was the third son of lawful birth from the Han Clan, one of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans. He used to be the Assistant Commander of the Eight Great Training Divisions. During the Nanlin Hunt, he happened to be on a break. He did not follow Xi Gu\u2019an, nor did he heed the Empress Dowager\u2019s instructions. Rumor had it that he was still asleep when the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0knocked on his door. As such, he escaped the autumn wind2\u00a0that had purged the Hua Faction.But Shen Zechuan knew that this man was someone Xue Xiuzhuo had planted there.On the eve of the Feast of A Hundred Officials, the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0sorted out their duty arrangements. According to the plan, Shen Zechuan had to remain before the Emperor, so it came as no surprise when he got the waist token.Han Cheng personally delivered the waist token to Shen Zechuan. Both men were inside the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019 office. He said, \u201cEverything is in order, except the easterly wind.3\u00a0When the time comes, I\u2019ll be at the side too. No matter what, His Majesty mustn\u2019t be hurt.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Shen Zechuan hung up the waist token and said with a smile, \u201cThis time, we will be depending on His Excellency the Commander-in-chief.\u201dHan Cheng felt apprehensive, but it would not do for him to reveal it. So he could only repeat, \u201cIf this matter fails and gets exposed, you and I will be sentenced to death for this crime. But if it succeeds, then the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0will be able to swipe a slice of the pie from the hands of the\u00a0Imperial Army. Everyone will live well from then on, and good days will be upon us.\u201d\u201cPlease rest assured, Your Excellency.\u201d Shen Zechuan said with a serious expression. \u201cWe brothers are of one mind. Nothing will go wrong.\u201dSeeing how composed and confident he was, Han Cheng breathed a sigh of relief.Outside, the snow fell increasingly harder. Even by the time it was dawn, it never stopped.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Before the Feast of A Hundred Officials, there was a sacrificial ceremony.4\u00a0The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0was already on the alert and ready for battle early in the morning. Xiao Chiye was neatly dressed in his court attire today. When he strode through the palace gates, he came face to face with Han Cheng. Just as he was exchanging conventional greetings with the latter, he saw Shen Zechuan.\u201cThe Left Guard stands guard before the Emperor.\u201d Xiao Chiye asked Han Cheng, as he looked at Shen Zechuan and pretended not to be acquainted with the latter, \u201cSo why is it assigned to\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0of the Company Commander rank and below?\u201d\u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0have now been reorganized, and many positions have been left vacant.\u201d Han Cheng said and looked back. \u201cThe ones who were picked are all first-rate experts. Many of them are disadvantaged by the fact that the year for promotion is not upon them yet, so they all seem to be of junior positions.\u201dXiao Chiye was on guard when he saw Shen Zechuan. But even if he could suppress the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0a notch, he did not have the authority to command the other party to swap the men. Because no matter how much the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0was inhibited, both it and the\u00a0Eastern Depot\u00a0took commands directly from the Emperor. As long as Li Jianheng said nothing, anyone else who gave orders summarily would be overstepping their authority.As if knowing what he was thinking, Shen Zechuan exchanged glances with him with eyes that spoke of a meaning Xiao Chiye could not read.Ahead of them, the Domesticated Elephants Office had already herded the elephants out. Li Jianheng was about to step out of the hall soon. Unable to stay for long, Xiao Chiye strode forward and left.This was the first time Li Jianheng held the ceremonial greatsword in his hands. It was so heavy he almost could not lift it. Even before he stepped out of the palace doors, he already felt his neck aching with that royal crown atop his head. This coronation attire,5\u00a0which had him shouldering the sun and the moon and bearing the stars on his back,6\u00a0finally revealed in him a trace of sober, imposing bearing from his typical gleeful and playful attitude.Li Jianheng\u2019s palms were sweating. He held up the greatsword before striding out of the door.The court elephants, draped with red velvet and gold saddles, stood at both sides. The various officials kowtowed and shouted out wishes of longevity upon the Emperor. Li Jianheng stood atop the stairs, his broadened field of vision taking in the panorama of thick clouds in the east, with skies and lands cloaked in a blanket of boundless snow. He stood up high above, so high it was almost as if he was up there in the clouds. The deafening sounds of \u201clong live, Your Majesty\u201d reverberated in his ears. Li Jianheng\u2019s heartbeat quickened. Pleasant surprise gradually washed over his face as his eyes successively moved down from Hai Liangyi to Xiao Jiming to all living beings in the world kneeling before him. He was the one and only supreme ruler!This is how it feels like to be the Emperor.Li Jianheng could not help but grasp the greatsword tightly. In this grand show of obeisances made to him, he felt as if he had obtained the strength and courage to contend with Heaven. This feeling was poles apart from the feeling of sitting in the Imperial Court. It was the thrill of being kowtowed to for the first time ever since the hunting grounds.Li Jianheng advanced along the long stairs and walked towards the ceremonial terrace. He walked very, very slowly, reveling in this entire journey of honor and glory.Of the tens of thousands of people, only Shen Zechuan slowly raised his head. He looked along the tall stairs past Li Jianheng\u2019s figure, where he, too, saw the dark and gloomy sky amidst the dancing snow.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8As the feast began, the Court of Imperial Entertainments began to dish out meals, while the Imperial Winery followed on their heels to serve wine without pause. Li Jianheng was fond of sweets, so the Imperial Bakery made quite a number of silk-nested tiger\u2019s eye candies.Li Jianheng sat on the Dragon Throne, with the Empress Dowager and Hua Xiangyi below him, followed by Muru, who had just been conferred the title of Imperial Concubine. Shen Zechuan and Han Cheng stood at the bottom of the steps, opposite the\u00a0Imperial Army. A eunuch from the Imperial Food Service kneeled behind Shen Zechuan to the right. Every dish on Li Jianheng\u2019s table had to be first tasted by the Imperial Food Service eunuch.Li Jianheng was in high spirits tonight. He repeatedly urged all those present to drink up, while he himself was somewhat intoxicated. Sitting on top, he said, \u201cEver since I\u2019ve ascended to the throne, I\u2019ve been fortunate to be assisted by wise talents. With a clear mirror7\u00a0like Secretariat Elder Hai by my side, there isn\u2019t a day I dare to forget to self-reflect.\u201dHe began to shoot his mouth off as soon as he drank too much.\u201cI\u2019m very grateful to Secretariat Elder Hai, and I wish to regard Secretariat Elder Hai as the Second Father8\u00a0of the Court. Such honor and glory have never been accorded to past Secretariat Elders before. Now, I shall give Secretariat Elder\u2026\u201dSecond Father!How could he speak of such words? The way he put it drained the color from Hai Liangyi\u2019s face. Hai Liangyi had already got up in astonishment, wanting to kneel in protest. At the same time, Li Jianheng belched from the wine, still waving his hand.\u201cNo need for Secretariat Elder to panic. It\u2019s what I should do\u2026\u201d\u201cI think this is improper.\u201d The Empress Dowager looked at Hai Liangyi and paused for a moment. It was as if she saw through Hai Liangyi\u2019s shock at that very moment. Turning to Li Jianheng, she said softly, \u201cSecretariat Elder Hai is the leader revered by all scholars in the world. His character is solemn and dignified. Since entering the court to serve as an official, he has had clean hands. He speaks bluntly and resolutely. If His Majesty were to equate this kind of trusted aide to a Second Father, then even if this would demonstrate Your Majesty\u2019s favor, the Secretariat Elder\u2019s intent to criticize social evils of the times for public interests would be lost.\u201dSeeing the Empress Dowager\u2019s mild demeanor, Li Jianheng laughed and said, \u201cIn the past, King Xiang9\u00a0valued relationships and respected Fan Zeng10\u00a0as his Second Father. Today, I want to express my gratitude for Secretariat Elder\u2019s assistance too, and address him as Second Father. It sounds intimate, and the title itself would give me pause for self-reflection! Secretariat Elder, Secretariat Elder, so how about it?\u201dHai Liangyi, already kowtowing, said, \u201cThis absolutely mustn\u2019t be done!\u201dIt was as if Li Jianheng was splashed in the face with cold water. That sternly uttered phrase of \u201cmustn\u2019t be done\u201d put a damper on his enthusiasm, making him displeased. His expression underwent a few changes before he eventually forced a smile and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a form of address for me to be on more intimate terms with the Secretariat Elder. So what does it matter?\u201dHai Liangyi said, \u201cYour Majesty is the sovereign, poles apart from an overlord11\u00a0confined to a narrow corner. This old subject was born in the mountain ridges of Hezhou. I\u2019m truly nothing but an uncouth, lowly person. How can I share the same address of \u2018father\u2019 as the sagely Emperor Guangcheng?!\u201dLi Jianheng\u2019s original intention was to win over the hearts of Hai Liangyi as well as all the scholars in the world. He wanted to use this to affirm that he was not an idiot who disrespected learning. But that was all the few books he had read. How could he have known that a mere address could evoke such vehement rejection from Hai Liangyi? He had no way to back down this very moment, like a man who found it difficult to dismount a tiger he had ridden.12\u00a0He even sobered up a few degrees.Li Jianheng could not bring himself to insist on it and embarrass himself further, so he thought of playing dumb and glossing it over. Thus, he said, \u201cIf the Secretariat Elder is unwilling, then forget it\u2026\u201d\u201cMy thinking is that,\u201d Hai Liangyi said, \u201cThose at the bottom will imitate the propensity of those at the top! Now that His Majesty has created this precedent tonight, then there will be people who will attempt to follow suit in the future. When that happens, they will collude to form cliques and factions that impede the imperial court, thereby jeopardizing the entire state. It has only been a month since the dust from the Hua Faction case settled. Past experiences, if not forgotten, will serve as a guide for the future. It\u2019s truly improper for Your Majesty to drink until dead drunk tonight!\u201dLi Jianheng clenched the wine cup tightly in his hands and surveyed the crowd below. It was only when he saw the officials hanging their heads low and not daring to look directly at him that his fury eased off some. He could not flare up at Hai Liangyi, but he did not want to admit the errors of his way today either. He sat restlessly on this Dragon throne. Having tasted the sweetness of submission from all living beings, how could he willingly open himself up to censure?He was the Emperor.Li Jianheng\u2019s eyes were already bloodshot from enduring it. He drank the last mouthful of wine and said, \u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s drop this matter. Help Secretariat Elder back to his seat.\u201dHai Liangyi was aware that tonight was not the time to admonish him, but it was hard to change his frank and outspoken nature. \u201cI still have something to say.\u201dLi Jianheng pursed his lips into a tight line and said nothing.Silence reigned in the banquet hall. Without getting a response, Hai Liangyi continued to kneel in place. They were now at a deadlock. No one else touched their chopsticks. Even the music from the reed instruments had ceased.Suddenly, a \u201cclack\u201d rang out.Xiao Chiye laid down his chopsticks at his own seat and laughed out loud, \u201cIt delights me to see the relationship between Li Jianheng and Secretariat Elder. The so-called sagely ruler and virtuous subject is nothing more than precisely this, with the Emperor and his subjects in harmonious council on state affairs, so the ancient saying goes. The presence of such a sagely ruler and upstanding official in Dazhou means that the age of prosperity is sure to fall upon us soon.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the blessing of the officials that His Majesty advocates freedom of speech and is receptive to criticisms.\u201d Xue Xiuzhuo raised his cup for a toast, \u201cIt\u2019s the new year tonight. Why not offer a toast to this sacred scene?\u201dThe group of officials lifted their cups and said their greetings in unison.Li Jianheng felt a little appeased amidst the sounds of greetings and wishes. On seeing a still kneeling Hai Liangyi, he could not refrain from letting loose a sigh. \u201cSecretariat Elder, please rise.\u201dWith the crisis averted, the Empress Dowager looked at Xiao Chiye for a moment before she prompted, \u201cIt\u2019s said that a man\u2019s lifelong wish to start a family and establish one\u2019s career. Does Ce\u2019 an have a betrothal candidate in mind?\u201dThere was a flash in Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes as he looked towards Xiao Chiye too.Xiao Chiye smiled without the slightest scruple and answered, \u201cTo reply Your Majesty, which of the noble ladies in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0would be willing to marry down to me the way I am now? Besides, it\u2019s not my aspiration to settle down.\u201dThe Empress Dowager said, \u201cThe Viceroy is too humble. Up-and-coming upstarts in the capital are few and far between nowadays. With your appearance, there will be beauties beckoning to you even when you cross the bridge on the eastern street.\u00a0Hereditary Prince, if you don\u2019t urge him, it may then be too late.\u201dXiao Jiming smiled too and replied, \u201cMy dear Father at home thinks his temperament is still volatile. He\u2019s afraid he would hold up the marriage and life of a maiden from some family.\u201dThe Empress Dowager turned her head aside once again and looked at Li Jianheng with a smile. \u201cLook at how not a single one of them is in a hurry. When the Prince of Libei was at this age, he was already married for three to four years.\u201dLi Jianheng had not come around from the previous situation, and he was feeling a little lackadaisical at the moment. Not daring to leave the Empress Dowager hanging, he glanced at Xiao Chiye and replied, \u201cMother may not be aware, Ce\u2019 an is reckless in nature. The common noble lady from\u00a0Qudu\u00a0will not be able to hold their own against him.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t put it this way and delay his marriage for no good reason.\u201d The Empress Dowager continued, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a noble lady from\u00a0Qudu. I\u2019m aware that Marquis Helian\u2019s daughter, Commandery Princess13\u00a0Zhaoyue, is of similar age with Ce\u2019 an. It\u2019s a good match.\u201dMarquis Helian was the Marquis of Chuancheng. He was a member of the Fei Clan, which was one of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans. The Empress Dowager had indeed appointed a marriage14\u00a0well-matched in status.Marquis Helian, Fei Kun, promptly gave a toast and looked in Xiao Jiming\u2019s direction.Xiao Chiye thought that the Empress Dowager would talk about Hua Xiangyi\u2019s marriage at the banquet. He did not expect the discussion this time to come directly for him instead. Outright rejection was not an option, but neither could he marry straight off in a muddle.Li Jianheng was caught off guard too. Dazed for a moment, he looked at Xiao Chiye and stuttered, \u201cI\u2026 Commandery Princess Zhaoyue\u2026\u201d Struck by a brainwave, he said, \u201cThe nation is still in mourning. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not appropriate to appoint marriage at this time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to pledge marriage and another to complete the marriage. We have not been having any good times lately. We could fix the betrothal first and wait for summertime to seek an auspicious day to hold the rites for the union.\u201d The Empress Dowager added affectionately, \u201cZhaoyue and Xiangyi are bosom friends. It\u2019d be perfect for them to get married at the same time.\u201dShe remained tight-lipped about who Hua Xiangyi was going to marry and merely pushed Commandery Princess Zhaoyue to Xiao Chiye. This made it clear that she regarded Xiao Chiye\u2019s marriage as a state affair and Hua Xiangyi\u2019s marriage as a private matter.Qi Zhuyin\u2019s expression was solemn, but unexpectedly enough, she said nothing.Seeing this, Lu Guangbai knew that it did not bode well and guessed that Qi Shiyu had already given his approval and told Qi Zhuyin not to say anything. However, getting married to Commandery Princess Zhaoyue was absolutely out of the question. If this marriage was decided and the Empress Dowager lifted Zhaoyue\u2019s status to Princess, Xiao Chiye would be marrying a princess. The Consort of Dazhou had no power, with only a title in name. It would strip Xiao Chiye of his military power in\u00a0Qudu, which he had only just grabbed on to.The wine in Xiao Chiye\u2019s throat burned like a raging fire. He had already risen to his feet, but then he saw the Empress Dowager smiling again.\u201cThe\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0is married to the daughter of the Lu Clan\u2019s Earl of Biansha from the Bianjun Commandery. Your little son is now around four to five years old, right?\u201dXiao Jiming replied, \u201cHe is now four years old.\u201d\u201cThe Grandson-Heir is already four years old, yet General Lu still does not have a wife.\u201d The Empress Dowager looked towards Lu Guangbai and added, \u201cBianjun is a desert land. It\u2019s not easy for the General to guard and defend it. Starting a family early will reduce one of the Earl of Biansha\u2019s concerns. General Lu seems to me to be of similar age to the\u00a0Hereditary Prince. Why? Is it also not the General\u2019s aspiration to start a family?\u201dLu Guangbai was momentarily at a loss for words. \u201cTo reply Your Majesty\u2014\u2014\u201dThe Empress Dowager continued, \u201cZhaoyue\u2019s disposition is lively and playful. Frankly speaking, Ce\u2019 an is indeed quite reckless. The General seems a lot more reliable instead. Ce\u2019 an, what do you think about it?\u201dIf Xiao Chiye did not marry Commandery Princess Zhaoyue, it would fall upon Lu Guangbai to marry her. This headache laid out in the banquet was precisely meant to put him in a dilemma.Xiao Chiye had already sent Zhao Hui to bribe someone from the Ministry of Rites. Once Her Majesty opened her mouth tonight, he would testify to the fact that Hua Xiangyi was Qi Shiyu\u2019s distant relative related by blood. With the law of propriety in the way and a wide gap in seniority, this marriage would fall apart. But the Empress Dowager would not give him the chance to counter at all. Who would have guessed that it would be his marriage that would be handed over tonight?It was at this moment Xiao Chiye saw the look in Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes. As both men stood under the watchful gaze of everyone present with this thorny issue pressing down upon them, their eyes met for the briefest flicker of an instant.Xiao Chiye strode a step forward and said, \u201cTo reply Your Majesty.\u201dThe Imperial Food Service eunuch was transferring dishes on behalf of the Imperial Bakery. He submissively divided out the portion he was to sample and picked up the chopsticks before looking at Li Jianheng who was about an arm away from him.Li Jianheng was still undecided as he listened to their confrontation with a frown. Sensing the lack of movement from the eunuch near him, he cast a sidelong glance over and asked, \u201cWhy are you standing\u2014\u201dIn the twinkling of an eye, the eunuch clenched the gold-clad chopsticks and, with a lightning move of his hand, stabbed it right towards Li Jianheng\u2019s neck!It happened so abruptly that Li Jianheng did not even have the time to react. All he could do was to watch helplessly as the tip of that chopstick came stabbing towards him. His entire body stiffened as his eyes betrayed the fear in them. He could not even move his fingers.In the split second the color drained from everyone\u2019s faces, Shen Zechuan had already drawn out\u00a0Yang Shan Xue. The cold glint of the straight blade flashed past.Li Jianheng\u2019s throat tightened as he yelled as loud as he could. As soon as he did so, hot, fresh blood splattered onto the front and hem of his robe. Li Jianheng shouted at the top of his voice, \u201cPROTECT ME\u2014\u201dThe eunuch\u2019s head rolled forward and fell onto Li Jianheng\u2019s body. Li Jianheng held on tightly to both sides of the dragon throne for support. Under this heavy stench of blood, he watched as someone caught hold of that headless body which was toppling over towards him.Shen Zechuan cast aside the body and turned around indifferently to command, \u201cProtect His Majesty!\u201dGe Qingqing immediately drew his sword. Snow-white glint cut through the air with a 'swish\u201d as the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0stood before the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0like a fortified, impregnable city, becoming Li Jianheng\u2019s primary shield.With the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0between them, Xiao Chiye had to look up before he could see Shen Zechuan\u2019s face.The balanced status quo they had always maintained was finally shattered right this very moment. Shen Zechuan looked down at him from high above and threw him a meaningful smile. That expression in his eyes was as concrete as it could be as it trampled down upon Xiao Chiye\u2019s chest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 : Power StruggleTerrified, Li Jianheng kicked that human head away with his leg shaking. He no longer cared about keeping up appearances. Right this moment, he wanted so much to shrink into the Dragon Throne. There was a roaring in his ears as he watched the fresh blood soak through his robe. It felt as though someone was strangling him by the throat; for a long time, he could not utter a single word.Shen Zechuan kneeled on one knee and said with a severe countenance, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Your Majesty. The assassin has already been executed. This humble subject was late in coming to your protection. For this sin, I deserve death!\u201dLi Jianheng\u2019s limbs seemed to be paralyzed as he struggled with the effort to grasp hold of the armrests of the throne and shift his gaze from the corpse to Shen Zechuan\u2019s face. He almost choked with sobs as he grabbed Shen Zechuan\u2019s sleeve and said, \u201cNot late\u2026 not late at all! You\u2026 Lanzhou, you\u2019ve done well! I, I almost\u2026\u201d\u201cSummon the Imperial Physician!\u201d Ignoring the bloody corpse, the Empress Dowager hurried over. She held Li Jianheng\u2019s hand and called out softly to him, \u201cYour Majesty, Your Majesty?\u201dLi Jianheng was still in a panic from the fear. He swallowed his saliva with some difficulty and hastily pulled out his hand from the Empress Dowager\u2019s palms to grasp Shen Zechuan\u2019s sleeve tightly. He pleaded, \u201cStay here. Lead the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0and remain here to protect me!\u201d\u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are\u00a0His Majesty\u2019s guards.\u201d Shen Zechuan said without blinking an eye. \u201cFor His Majesty, the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0will willingly brave through fire and water. This humble subject will immediately escort Your Majesty back to Mingli Hall.\u201dEveryone at the banquet was still badly shaken. Xue Xiuzhuo took a few steps forward and said sharply, \u201cArrest and detain everyone from the Imperial Food Service, Court of Imperial Entertainments, Imperial Bakery, and Imperial Winery. To think there is an assassin hiding among the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u2019s personal attendants. All those involved in the arrangements of the inner palace eunuchs and guards\u2019 defenses must be held accountable!\u201d\u201cWho is in charge of patrols tonight?\u201d The Empress Dowager asked.The banquet hall fell silent. Xiao Chiye bowed and said, \u201cTo reply Your Majesty, it\u2019s this subject.\u201dThe Empress Dowager did not pursue further. Instead, she looked at Li Jianheng, as did the other officials.For this eunuch to be someone from the Imperial Food Service, he first had to have a clean family background and a clean history. The time he entered the palace, the services and offices among the Twenty-four Yamens he had worked in, and even which inner palace eunuchs he had been on good terms with in the past, all had to be investigated. Not only that, even the people he came into contact with had to be checked and recorded in the official files. Xiao Chiye was responsible for the guards\u2019 defenses. He was supposed to vet all these matters thoroughly before the Feast of A Hundred Officials. The assassin had walked in through his layers of defenses. There was no way he could escape responsibility.With his lips pale as he dripped cold sweat, Li Jianheng said, \u201cTake the eunuchs of the various services into custody first. I\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his words, he fainted.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Tonight was destined to be a sleepless one. Li Jianheng was lying unconscious in the inner room. The Imperial Physicians gathered in a group, while the Empress Dowager listened to their diagnosis behind the hanging curtain once more. Hai Liangyi waited on the side, as instructed explicitly by the Empress Dowager.Han Cheng led the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0to stand guard with their swords under the eaves, while the court officials kneeled outside. The night of Yuanchun1\u00a0was incredibly cold. Many elderly officials were already shivering from the freezing cold, hanging on with their sheer will alone.The whole palace, shrouded in a particularly chilling atmosphere, was dead silent.Xiao Chiye was not among them. He needed to arrest the inner palace eunuchs with the relevant personnel from the Ministry of Justice and the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau. Furthermore, the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0also had to be detained. The\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s Assistant Commander responsible for screening the manpower tonight had his waist token suspended. Together with the eunuchs, he was thrown into prison.There was no fire brazier set up inside the hall. Only the lanterns were lit.Xiao Chiye was sitting on the lower right of the Minister of Justice, Kong Qiu. On the left was the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u2019s Left Censor-in-chief, Cen Yu, and Right Censor-in-chief, Fu Linye.If this had proceeded like before, Xiao Chiye would have held the same authority as the Minister of Justice to conduct trials, which would have placed him on equal footing and seating as the latter. But this time, to avoid arousing suspicion, he could only make do with the lower right seating and hand the authority of supervision over to the two head officials from the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau.This year was a period of troubled times, where a fresh wave of problems rose before the former had subsided. The\u00a0Three Judicial Offices\u00a0had never judged cases consecutively like this; what\u2019s more, all the cases were major ones that concerned the Emperor\u2019s life.Kong Qiu finished the tea that had cooled and said nothing as they waited for the prisoner to be summoned. In fact, from the moment they had sat here, no one had dared to make small talk. Everyone knew that it was not the time to jest and joke around. All of them wore solemn expressions on their faces.Xiao Chiye sat in his seat and rotated his thumb ring in silence as he lost himself in contemplation.They had come prepared for this case, just like Xiaofuzi\u2019s case back then. It became all the more convoluted in the instant it had occurred. If one could look beyond the facade the moment it happened, it would look like countless strings being pulled behind the scenes, concealing a deep-seated motive.The inner eunuchs from the Imperial Food Service had to test the dishes for the\u00a0Son of Heaven. As such, each one from top to bottom had been thoroughly vetted for all three generations. To use this kind of person and turn him into an assassin would be extremely difficult. Yet, it was also very easy.First of all, it must be someone who could come into contact with the inner palace eunuchs, or a eunuch who was hiding in the palace but working for powers on the outside. Only these two kinds of people could coerce or entice the eunuch into assassinating the Emperor.Xiao Chiye suddenly remembered something at this point and stopped turning his thumb ring. Right at this time, the summoned prisoner was brought over. It was the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s Assistant Commander.Kong Qiu cut the crap and went straight to the point. \u201cAs the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s Assistant Commander, you are the one responsible for examining the armed staff of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0who would stand before the Emperor tonight, as well as the eunuch the Imperial Food Service arranged to taste-test the dishes. How much do you know about this eunuch?\u201dThe name of the Assistant Commander was Meng Rui, a man from a military household2\u00a0Xiao Chiye had promoted in the sixth year of Xiande.3\u00a0He was a very prudent man who originally served as the Office Manager4\u00a0in the\u00a0Imperial Army. With a gaze that never wavered, he answered in a steady voice, \u201cThe eunuch assassin went by the name Guisheng. He was twenty-six and a native of the City of Chuncheng. His father, a resident of Baishui Street in Chuncheng, passed away from illness in the sixth year of Xiande. As the only child in the family, Guisheng entered the palace in the year of Yongyi and had been here for twelve years since. He joined the Imperial Food Service in the first year of Xiande and started to taste dishes for the former Emperor from the fourth year of Xiande onwards. He had no special hobbies, and there is hardly anyone he associated with.\u201dKong Qiu thought for a moment and asked, \u201cWho was the one who arranged for him to taste the dishes tonight?\u201dMeng Rui answered, \u201cThe Female Official of the Imperial Food Service, Fuling.\u201dKong Qiu first looked at the men from the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau, then at Xiao Chiye before he nodded and said, \u201cThe weapon used for the assassination was the golden chopsticks used by the Emperor. The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0could do nothing about it even if they did a body search or a background check on him. How about this? Assistant Commander Meng, please wait for a moment. Summon Fuling of the Imperial Food Service.\u201dMeng Rui retreated to the side. From start to end, he never made eye contact with Xiao Chiye.Xiao Chiye was actually not as nervous as the others expected him to be. He knew fully well that this assassination could not strip him of his military power. Perhaps he would be punished and have his salary reduced after this incident, but these would not have any significant impact on him. When the incident happened, he was too far away. There was no way he could beat Shen Zechuan to it and save the Emperor. Plus, the seating arrangement was planned according to the customs, so no one could criticize it either. And there was one more thing. That is, the speed at which Shen Zechuan had drawn his sword back then was simply too fast. In almost the blink of an eye, his blade had already returned to its sheath, and the assassin\u2019s head had toppled to the ground. This differed completely from the speed he had exhibited last time on that rainy night. Even if Xiao Chiye had been standing beside him at the time of incident, he might not have necessarily been faster than him. But it was what was going to transpire after the assassination that bothered Xiao Chiye the most. He had to plan ahead and save for a rainy day. He needed to curb the possibility of this matter burning its way to him.Xiao Chiye thought again of that final expression in Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes.The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019 usual practice was to have a period of promotion once every eight years. The subordinates would first be assigned to one of the twelve offices according to their household register classification,5\u00a0then promoted according to their on-the-job performance. There were just too few opportunities for an exception to be made. Shen Zechuan\u2019s family background was unusual. Although he was now absolved from sin and exempted from punishment, he still could not be considered to have military status. If he wanted to lead and command the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, then he had to find a way to get promoted.The reasons Xiao Chiye had been suppressing the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0these few months were to consolidate the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s influence and clout, and to guard against Shen Zechuan\u2019s advancements through the ranks. The situation in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0was chaotic, yet it was also as distinct as the waters of the Jing and Wei Rivers.6\u00a0Everyone was already familiar with one another. All of them collaborated with one another for their own interests, then fought with each other for their own interests. Only Shen Zechuan was an unpredictable variable. Xiao Chiye had tried every possible way to sound and feel him out, but he never found out what Shen Zechuan\u2019s actual intent was.If he could not figure out his motive, then he could not cooperate with him with peace of mind.Xiao Chiye had hoped that Shen Zechuan could stay quietly at the bottom rank. But the assassination case this time was Shen Zechuan\u2019s answer.Impossible.He was his own blade. He would kill out a path for his own. He would not deign to be at the beck and call of others. He wanted to tear others apart, not to obey.What could a night of bedroom pleasure change?That was the howls of their resentment being vented in the pitch-dark night, a panting which stemmed from the entanglement of both men\u2019s desires. It was amidst the collision of bodies and pounding of flesh that gave rise to the feeling of fellow sufferers commiserating with one another. But this was still not enough to hamper both men from making the choices they did.Xiao Chiye would never give up the power in his hands. This was the blade on which his survival depended. If he could not return to Libei, then he must grasp tightly onto this blade. Likewise, Shen Zechuan would not tolerate himself being subservient to others. He would not let others decide the course of his fate. He needed to rise through the ranks. He\u00a0had\u00a0to.Xiao Chiye suddenly clenched his fist.Seeing that Shen Zechuan was involved in the plotting of this case, then who were his accomplices?\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Li Jianheng had yet to regain consciousness. Shen Zechuan was switched off duties so he could get a little rest. As he wiped his hands in the office, he heard the door behind him open, followed by someone entering.\u201cAccording to the plan you spoke of, Han Cheng should be the one stepping forward to save the Emperor.\u201d Xue Xiuzhuo rolled up his sleeves a little and washed his hands in the cold water basin. He smiled and said, \u201cThe few of us brothers have been played for fools by Your Excellency Shen.\u201d\u201cThe situation was critical.\u201d Shen Zechuan did not look back. \u201cIf Han Cheng has that ability, then it wouldn\u2019t matter to have him do the saving. But he just had to be slow. What can I do?\u201d\u201cThis matter won\u2019t take\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0down. At most, he will just be impeached for governance negligence. You, however, showed your true colors before him this time. Even if you move up the ladder, you will not have an easy time in the future.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in the same boat with Your Excellency, the Assistant Minister of the Court of Judicial Review. If I\u2019m having a hard time\u2026\u201d Shen Zechuan looked back and said with a smile, \u201c\u2026 then do you think you can rest easy?\u201d\u201cI heard that there is a kind of mad dog ruthless enough to bite one of its own.\u201d Xue Xiuzhuo dried his palms in the air and looked at Shen Zechuan. \u201cBeing on the same boat with someone who uses others as stepping stones this unreservedly will, instead, strike fear in one\u2019s heart.\u201d\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cThe ones who gain the upper hand tonight are all my brothers. Am I not the scapegoat before\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0who takes the fall for everyone? I\u2019ll be a thorn in\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u2019s flesh in the future. He ought to hate me to death right now.\u201d\u201cThe friendship between His Majesty and\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0runs deep. His act of saving His Majesty\u2019s life at the Nanlin Hunting Grounds is the hardest to forget. Even if you stand out this time, you might not necessarily be able to top and replace\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er.\u201d\u201cThe first step is always the hardest.\u201d Shen Zechuan smiled. \u201cIf His Majesty truly is grateful to\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0for saving his life, then he wouldn\u2019t continue to keep him trapped in\u00a0Qudu. The so-called gratitude of man is only worth so much.\u201dXue Xiuzhuo wiped his hands and laughed for a moment before he said, \u201cAlthough there was a slight deviation in our plan tonight, it was, nevertheless, still a success. Your Honor the Judge,7\u00a0please be sure to look out for me in the future.\u201dThe Judge of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0was a fifth-grade8\u00a0official post. By this, Xue Xiuzhuo was telling Shen Zechuan how much he could get during the conferment of reward in the days to come.Shen Zechuan was not surprised. He said, \u201cThe people from the Imperial Food Service are going to stand trial. The Minister of Justice, Kong Qiu, is an impartial and incorruptible official. All of you better not buckle under his interrogations.\u201d\u201cSince we dared to do it, then we aren\u2019t afraid of them investigating.\u201d Xue Xiuzhuo tidied up his sleeves and said courteously, \u201cI hope we can continue to work together in the new year. May we soon get what our hearts desire.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m indebted to Your Excellency the Assistant Minister for looking after me.\u201d Shen Zechuan stared at him and said genially, \u201cNo doubt I will fulfill this long-cherished wish.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 : Beating Them At Their Own GameLi Jianheng had a nightmare.He dreamed of that rainy night at the Nanlin Hunting Grounds, where the branches slapped at his face harshly as he covered his head and dodged frantically.The horse he rode galloped wildly onward. Li Jianheng wanted to clutch the reins in fear, but Xiao Chiye suddenly turned around and grabbed him by the collar to toss him off the horse.\u201cCe\u2019an, save me!\u201d Li Jianheng pleaded on his knees after falling to the ground. \u201cCe\u2019an, Ce\u2019an! We are brothers! Don\u2019t leave me here!\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s expression was grave amidst the flashes of lightning and claps of thunder. He faced him and said callously, \u201cKnock him out and hoist him away!\u201dLi Jianheng watched with his snot and tears flowing as Chen Yang approached him. He could not help but feel so frightened that he moved backward and brandished his arms as he bellowed, \u201cI \u2026 I\u2019m the Emperor! How can you treat me this way?\u201dLi Jianheng\u2019s back bumped into someone. He turned his head and looked back to see Emperor Xiande stooping over to grab hold of his wrist. He immediately called out, \u201cImperial Brother, Imperial Brother, save me!\u201dEmperor Xiande tightened his grip, his fingers digging into Li Jianheng\u2019s flesh. He coughed blood and said in a frosty voice, \u201cHe who saves you today can kill you tomorrow! Do you understand?\u201dLi Jianheng struggled painfully, but he could not free his arm no matter what he did. The rain from the above suddenly turned into drops of something sticky. Li Jianheng touched it. His palm came away full of blood. He looked up, and a head tumbled down from the darkness with a \u201cthud\u201d.With an inscrutable burst of strength, Li Jianheng pushed and kicked himself free from Emperor Xiande\u2019s hand. Gasping, he crawled up from the mud and trembled as he kicked the human head aside before crying and shouting at the black shadows around him, \u201cI\u2019m the Emperor. I\u2014I\u2019m the\u00a0Son of Heaven! Who wants to kill me? Who?!\u201d\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d Someone called him softly. \u201cYour Majesty.\u201dLi Jianheng abruptly opened his eyes. He stared at the golden roof absent-mindedly and murmured, \u201cWho wants to kill me\u2026 Who wants to kill me\u2026\u201dThe Empress Dowager wiped away the sweat for Li Jianheng with a handkerchief and bent over to say, \u201cJianheng, Imperial Mother is here!\u201dJianheng!Sorrow overcame Li Jianheng. His mother had died early, and Emperor Guangcheng had never once looked at him in the eyes. In all the years he had indulged in carnal pleasures, no one had ever called him Jianheng.\u201cImperial Mother\u2026\u201d Li Jianheng choked with sobs and cried out, \u201cMother!\u201dThe Empress Dowager turned her head slightly, as though she was wiping away her tears, and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been out for the entire night. I was truly afraid. If you\u2019re still in pain somewhere, you must tell me.\u201dLi Jianheng looked at the Empress Dowager and noticed that she was still wearing the ceremonial robe from last night. She must have been here watching over him the entire night. Li Jianheng immediately propped himself up and saw the gray hair on the Empress Dowager\u2019s temples. Both her eyes were slightly red, and she looked so much more haggard.Li Jianheng felt warm inside. He wiped his eyes, held the Empress Dowager\u2019s arms, and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have worried Mother. I\u2019m fine.\u201dHai Liangyi was kneeling outside, where he had also been keeping watch for the entire night. He knew that Li Jianheng had already woken up when he heard sounds of speaking inside and could not help but feel relieved.A moment later, the palace maids entered with light movements to wait on Li Jianheng and help him wash up. The Empress Dowager personally held the medicine bowl and tasted it herself before feeding it to Li Jianheng.Li Jianheng finished up the medicine. He still did not look too good, but his complexion was much better than last night. He put on his boots and walked out, where he saw a still kneeling Hai Liangyi. Greatly touched, he stepped forward to help Hai Liangyi up and said, \u201cSecretariat Elder, I\u2019m fine!\u201dHai Liangyi almost could not stand up. Li Jianheng did not want him to continue keeping watch and consequently dismissed him along with all the major officials kneeling outside, leaving only Kong Qiu, Cen Yu, and Fu Linye, who had been investigating all night.\u201cWhat have you found out?\u201d Li Jianheng asked impatiently, \u201cMinister Kong, tell me quickly.\u201dKong Qiu kowtowed and said, \u201cThe Ministry of Justice has been investigating through the night. Our investigations show that the eunuch assassin was named Guisheng. He was assigned by Fuling, a female official of the Imperial Food Service, to assume the duty of tasting the dishes at the Feast of A Hundred Officials.\u201d\u201cFemale official?\u201d Li Jianheng wondered in astonishment. \u201cWhy is this female official trying to harm me?\u201dKong Qiu replied, \u201cThe reason is unknown.\u201dLi Jianheng said anxiously, \u201cYou didn\u2019t find out after investigating for the whole night?\u201dKong Qiu exchanged glances with the other two men. After a moment of silence, he said, \u201cYour Majesty is unaware, but Fuling, knowing that she can\u2019t escape the long arm of the law, has already consumed poison to mute herself. She\u2019s now awaiting her punishment.\u201dUnderstanding suddenly dawned on Li Jianheng. He said, \u201cShe\u2019s a female official in the palace. Why would she do such a thing? She must be afraid of letting something slip under heavy torture, so she consumed poison first to make herself a mute! There must be an instigator behind this!\u201dKong Qiu said again, \u201cYour Majesty is wise. My two colleagues from the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0and I think so too. Hence, we dug deep into this woman and discovered that she still has an aged mother who resides in a remote corner alley on Donglong Street. Although her dwelling is small, it\u2019s not something a mere female official of the Imperial Palace can afford. This humble subject continued investigating and discovered that she was indeed not the one who bought the house herself. Instead, it was a human broker of Donglong Street who let her stay there on credit.\u201dLi Jianheng was intimately acquainted with Donglong Street, and Kong Qiu\u2019s words immediately roused his doubts. He said, \u201cSince it\u2019s only her and her widowed mother in the family, then, in all likelihood, there\u2019ll be nothing of value she can put up as collateral for a house.\u201dKong Qiu said, \u201cExactly. I find there to be many questionable doubts in this case, so I summoned the human broker over to question him and learned that it was on account of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0that the human broker let her have the house on credit.\u201dLi Jianheng\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He was on tenterhooks as he paused for a moment before asking, \u201cWhat does this have to do with the\u00a0Imperial Army?\u201dKong Qiu said, \u201cThis was what Yuan Liu, a sixth-grade Judge1\u00a0of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s Judicial Office, specifically told the human broker. Although Yuan Liu and Fuling aren\u2019t betrothed, there\u2019re long-standing rumors of an illicit affair between them.\u201dLi Jianheng suddenly rose and asked, \u201cDoes Viceroy Xiao know?\u201dKong Qiu knew that he was on good terms with Xiao Chiye. For a moment, he could not tell if he intended to protect Xiao Chiye or was planning something else, so he could only answer truthfully, \u201cThe Viceroy pleaded to be unaware of this matter.\u201dLi Jianheng remained rooted in place. His expression underwent a few changes before he eventually said, \u201c\u2026 There are many people in the\u00a0Imperial Army. It stands to reason that he\u2019s not in the know about this. Don\u2019t disclose or make this matter known first. You may withdraw for now. Summon Han Cheng and Shen Zechuan in. I want to reward them!\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Standing on the hardened snow, Xiao Chiye kicked the door to the torture prison open. The prison guard within had already gotten news of his arrival, so he hurriedly led Xiao Chiye inside.Fuling, only twenty-three years of age, was locked up within. Because of the torture she received, she was now sitting motionlessly on the hay with her bun all disheveled.Xiao Chiye stepped through the cell door. Chen Yang took off his cloak for him. He was so tall and imposing that the sight of him caused Fuling to tremble out of fear the moment he strode through the door.Xiao Chiye was actually very dashing. He gave off a complicated vibe that was a blend of frivolousness and ferocity. As a result, he could be either a frivolous young master or a glacial lord of the Asura.2\u00a0 He changed his mask freely, and once swapped, even his bearing would change to befit the occasion.Right now, he was a noble young master who was just passing by this place.Xiao Chiye first sized up the cell. He bent over slightly to look through that narrow window and saw that it was still the prison\u2019s high walls outside. He could not help but lose interest. Retracting his gaze, he straightened up again, then turned his head and lowered his eyes to look at Fuling, who was on the ground.Fuling clung to the wall, feeling as if those eyes were filled with innate contempt.\u201cFemale official of the Imperial Food Service.\u201d Xiao Chiye said.Fuling did not raise her head and merely stared at his boots.Chen Yang carried over a chair for Xiao Chiye to sit. He propped a knee and looked at the top of Fuling\u2019s head. \u201cYuan Liu has a wife and concubines, yet he still risked the suspension of his waist token to arrange a residence for you. How gorgeous are you that he could even be coaxed into abandoning his own life? Raise your head. Let me see.\u201dFuling shrank into herself and did not respond.Xiao Chiye leaned back and said, \u201cHe\u2019s old enough to be your father, and you\u2019re still willing? Becoming a female official is different from becoming a palace maid. When you are released, you could at least be married to a descendant from a proper background. Yuan Liu is a sixth-grade official of insignificance, and a military ruffian to boot. He has neither affluence nor influence. Are you too blind or too infatuated to be choosing him?\u201dThe prison cell was quiet.\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about Yuan Liu for now. What could you possibly have used to coerce Guisheng into assassination? You don\u2019t have money either, so the instigator must have been someone else. You\u2019re now a mute, a scapegoat whose fate has been decided early on. Your master is a brilliant manipulator to use the likes of you all he can and kick you aside after. Whether you live or die has nothing to do with me. But since you implicated me, Xiao Ce\u2019an, in this mess, then do you think you can just die easily like this?\u201d Xiao Chiye chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, lady.\u201dChen Yang turned around and nodded to the prison guard behind him. The clanking sounds of chains and shackles rang out as Yuan Liu, who was filthy all over, was dragged out.Yuan Liu stumbled towards Fuling and snapped, \u201cYou bitch! To think you\u2019d bring me down this way!\u201dFuling trembled and crawled along the wall towards the other side. Yuan Liu grabbed hold of her ankle and said dismally, \u201cWhat am I to you? I treated you so well, and this is how you repay me!\u201dFuling\u2019s tears would not stop as she was pulled back. She kicked Yuan Liu and let out a raspy, glottal scream.Yuan Liu tugged at her and said, \u201cWhen your elderly mother was critically sick, I carried her on my back to see the physician! I gave you whatever you wanted. You not only deceived me; you even want to drag my whole family to die with you! You despicable woman!\u201dThe shackles made a sound as Yuan Liu, who had lost control of himself, was pulled back by Chen Yang. His arms were still outstretched as he said with a ferocious expression, \u201cI will not let you off! I will never let you off, even when I become a ghost!\u201dXiao Chiye looked again through the small window where he sat and saw a piece of the sky the size of a\u00a0square\u00a0cun3\u00a0outside. There was no snow today, only pale clouds piling up in the sky. He was indifferent to the drama of grudges being played out before him.Yuan Liu sat on his heels on the ground as he bawled inconsolably. He then crawled towards Xiao Chiye and kowtowed to him while begging, \u201cViceroy, Viceroy! Forgive me this once! I\u2019m begging you. I was bewitched and blinded by lust! I\u2019m willing to slave it out for you like an ox or a horse as repayment for this favor!\u201dXiao Chiye looked at him, \u201cI\u2019m not the one who holds your life in my hands. Spare me your begging and go beg her instead. Kowtow to her for the sake of all the young and old in your family. Consider it a repayment of the debt you owe your wives and sons for seeking the momentary pleasure of an affair behind their backs.\u201dYuan Liu then turned to Fuling, begging and kowtowing, \u201cLet me off! Can\u2019t you just let me off? I have nothing to do with this matter! I\u2019m begging you! I\u2019m begging you! My whole family of eight\u2014I don\u2019t want them all to die here!\u201dFuling shed tears but did not look at him.Yuan Liu\u2019s tears poured in torrents. Genuinely afraid now, he kowtowed until his forehead bled. He said, \u201cFuling\u2026 One night of husband and wife is worth a hundred days of gratitude\u2026 Even though we have yet to be married, the sentiments of these past years are still here! I\u2019m begging you, please don\u2019t pin this on me! I\u2019ll be your son, your grandson in my next life! Please let me off! I wanted to give that residence to your elderly mother as a show of filial respect. How could you\u2026\u201d He was sobbing so hard that he almost choked as he struggled to continue, \u201cHow could you take it and\u2026 threaten my entire family\u2019s lives with it? Do you not have a heart?\u201dFuling hoarsely uttered something with a pained expression as she kowtowed to Yuan Liu too. Her mouth opened and shut as she mouthed words that were clearly 'sorry\u201d.Yuan Liu moved forward on his knees and held Fuling by the arms. The blood streamed down his forehead as he cried sorrowfully, \u201cI don\u2019t want your kowtows! I want you to explain this clearly! I don\u2019t want to die\u2026 Fuling! Don\u2019t ruin me\u2026\u201dOn seeing this, Xiao Chiye commented, \u201cPlotting an assassination will not land you a sentence of execution by decapitation. It\u2019s fine if you want to die. But it\u2019s such a pity for your mother to be this old and still have to endure the tortures. Do you not know the kind of place the\u00a0Imperial Prison\u00a0is? Being skinned and flayed are all possible outcomes if she were to fall into the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019 hands.\u201dFuling looked up and wept.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cDid your master not communicate this to you? I\u2019ll make sure this case doesn\u2019t end quickly. Another day of delay is another day of punishment, for you, for him, and for your mother. You can keep taking the tortures until I\u2019m satisfied, then we can say our goodbyes.\u201dFuling sobbed hatefully at him.Xiao Chiye remained still and merely looked at her as he said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it said that you should look who the owner is before you beat up a dog? Now that you\u2019ve bitten me, Xiao Ce\u2019 an, then we shall all suffer together. I\u2019ll whip you until your skin flays and your flesh is torn, until you\u2019d rather die than live. Let\u2019s see who will succumb first. Chen Yang, drag her elderly mother over.\u201dChen Yang answered and exited the prison door.Fuling suddenly screamed, but her throat was already damaged, and the scream sounded like the cry of a beast at the brink of desperation. She charged towards Xiao Chiye and pounced onto the ground, using her fingers to scrawl out characters.Xiao Chiye leaned over and watched for a while before saying, \u201cGive her paper and a brush. I want this to be written down in black and white.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Fuling was taken away by Chen Yang to sign her confession, leaving only Xiao Chiye and Yuan Liu in the prison cell. Seeing that Xiao Chiye was about to leave, Yuan Liu immediately grabbed hold of the corner of Xiao Chiye\u2019s robe.\u201cV-Viceroy!\u201d said Yuan Liu, \u201cIt\u2019s all good now\u2026 Does that mean I can\u2026\u201dPutting on his cloak, Xiao Chiye turned his head back and said, \u201cWhen did you take up the post as a Judge at the Judicial Office?\u201dYuan Liu hurriedly gestured with his fingers and answered, \u201cThe third year after the Viceroy was appointed.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cIf so, then you\u2019re with me.\u201dYuan Liu nodded his head in a panic and said, \u201cI\u2019m Viceroy\u2019s man!\u201dXiao Chiye was now feeling somewhat vexed after having stayed up all night. He held onto his blade and used the sheath to push away Yuan Liu\u2019s hand. He said, \u201cMy men don\u2019t have this much clout to get Donglong Street\u2019s human brokers to sell to them on credit. All the newly bought estates by the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0need to be reported, but you didn\u2019t. Apart from this residence, you also have farmlands outside the city. You\u2019re faring pretty well for a sixth-grade Judge. Do you really not know who\u2019s feeding you?\u201dTears and snot flowed as Yuan Liu burst into tears. \u201cI\u2019ve been deceived. I shouldn\u2019t have coveted those bits of things! Viceroy, Viceroy! But I didn\u2019t betray the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2026.\u201dXiao Chiye slightly stretched his neck that was becoming sore. Without sparing him another look, he said, \u201cHow old is your son?\u201d\u201cFour\u2026 four years old.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take care of him for you.\u201d Xiao Chiye said expressionlessly, \u201cEnd yourself after this case concludes.\u201dThe moment the prison cell door slammed shut, Yuan Liu collapsed limply to the ground.Xiao Chiye stepped into the dark and damp prison hallway. As he listened to the wails behind him, he received the confession statement from Chen Yang. He had only just strode out of the prison\u2019s main gate when he saw Gu Jin rushing over.\u201cYoung Master.\u201d Gu Jin said, \u201cFuling\u2019s mother is dead.\u201dChen Yang furrowed his brows. \u201cFortunately, Master didn\u2019t enter the palace this morning. Otherwise, Fuling would be left without misgivings, and we wouldn\u2019t have gotten our hands on this confession.\u201d\u201cA stack of papers.\u201d Xiao Chiye flipped through the confession statement under the light. \u201cFuling didn\u2019t even see the other person\u2019s face. We can\u2019t snare anyone with this alone.\u201dChen Yang said, \u201cAt least the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0is in the clear. Master, will you go into the palace and present this to his Majesty?\u201dXiao Chiye looked at him and asked, \u201cWhy must the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0be in the clear?\u201dChen Yang and Gu Jin were both dumbfounded.Xiao Chiye sneered, \u201cIf I\u2019m to be the caged beast, I should act the part of being besieged by others. They\u2019re in such a hurry to splash dirty water4\u00a0on me. It\u2019s not enough. I\u2019ll not only take this dirty water right to the face, I\u2019ll even roll in the mud. The filthier, the better. Let them vilify me so that they can pull off their unified front and be the accomplished ones pulling the wool over the public. If they can even trample upon the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0Viceroy this easily, then His Majesty ought to be suspicious and afraid once he returns to his senses. It\u2019s only recently that the Hua Clan is done for. Whoever wants to be the new faction will be just asking for death.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 : Cold GlintBefore Xiao Chiye entered the palace, Shen Zechuan already had an audience with Li Jianheng at Mingli Hall and was conferred the title of a fifth-grade1\u00a0Judge2\u00a0of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. As such, his waist token was replaced to a gold-plated bronze token embossed with a\u00a0Xiezhi3\u00a0amidst patterns of clouds, and with the words \u201cGuard\u201d on one side and \u201cEmperor\u2019s Entourage\u201d on the other.Having only received some rewards this time, Han Cheng was inwardly unhappy. He knew that he had been used by Shen Zechuan as a stepping stone. But he also knew that Shen Zechuan was now in the Emperor\u2019s good graces, so he must not let ill will form between them.Back at the office hall, Shen Zechuan\u2019s comrades all came forth to congratulate him. Shen Zechuan responded to them one by one. When Han Cheng saw that the men had more or less dispersed, he said, \u201cThis is the first time you\u2019re wearing a gold token. There are matters that you\u2019re still unsure of, right?\u201dShen Zechuan humbled himself and said, \u201cI\u2019ll still need Your Excellency the Commander-in-chief to guide me.\u201dFeeling flattered, Han Cheng said, \u201cThis gold token for guards must be worn at the waist when you are on duty, and should not be shown externally when you are on break. Those who are part of the Emperor\u2019s entourage usually still hold a post in the Twelve Offices. You can\u2019t behave like you used to; you have to be more prudent with your words. Although you have carried out missions in the past, it\u2019s different now. For future missions, if it\u2019s an \u2018arrest warrant\u2019, don\u2019t be in such a hurry to initiate the arrest. You have to head to the Office of Scrutiny for Justice and let the Supervising Secretary there affix his signature. If it is a \u2018local order\u2019, then you will have to leave\u00a0Qudu\u00a0for said place to investigate the case. Before you leave, you have to make a trip to the Ministry of Justice and\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0to sign off on it.\u201dWith modesty, Shen Zechuan listened to his teachings.When Han Cheng saw that his attitude was respectful and was no different from how he was before his promotion, he could not help but to feel an urge to foster this talent. He continued, \u201cIn the past, the\u00a0Eastern Depot\u00a0lorded it over us. Each time we see the\u00a0Eastern Depot\u00a0eunuchs when we head out, we have to bow down to them and fawn on them. But now the\u00a0Twenty-four Yamen\u00a0is vacant and unattended, and the\u00a0Eastern Depot\u00a0is all but dismissed from office. They are the ones who should bow on seeing us now. There\u2019s no need to play nice to the eunuchs. However, there is one thing you must remember\u2014that is, although the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0take orders from the Emperor, we still need to have dealings with the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices. Most of the time, when we go elsewhere for fieldwork, it\u2019s with the Censor from the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau. Everyone\u2019s functions and authority seem detached from one another, but in fact, they still need each other. So when you are out on missions, you must maintain a good relationship with the officials from the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices. Never lose your temper at them. If you unwittingly leave behind pent-up animosity, you will have a hard time with your future assignments.\u201dShen Zechuan already knew these matters by heart, but he listened intently as if this were his first time hearing of them.Lastly, Han Cheng gave him a favor and told him, \u201cIf you need a new batch of manpower, go to the Duty Records Room and choose from the book register.\u201dAfter thanking him, Shen Zechuan stepped out of the door and walked along the corridor to make his way outside. He was not in a rush to head to the Duty Records Room to choose his men. When he walked out of the palace gates, Xiao Chiye was sitting in the horse carriage waiting for him.Shen Zechuan paused in his tracks and was about to turn around.Xiao Chiye partially lifted the curtain and said unhurriedly, \u201cNow that you\u2019ve gotten a promotion and a raise, you wouldn\u2019t be too stingy to treat me to a drink, would you?\u201dShen Zechuan saw Ding Tao and Gu Jin standing on either side of Xiao Chiye, glaring at him like tigers watching their prey. So he scoffed a breath of cold hair and answered calmly, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t. I was just looking for you.\u201dBoth men went to the courtyard that Xiao Chiye had used to invite both of their\u00a0shifu\u00a0for a meal. The inside of the house had been cleared of tables and chairs. Small screens4\u00a0were used to partition out seats on all four sides, and there was a simple but exquisite table with curved ends5\u00a0in the middle. It was a very suitable place to have a drink and a chat.It was hot in the room. Both men both took off their coats.Xiao Chiye sat cross-legged in a casual pose, whereas Shen Zechuan sat on his heels in a dignified fashion. Xiao Chiye laughed and said, \u201cWhen it comes to our bearings, you look more like the gentleman of noble birth. Did Ji Gang-shifu\u00a0also teach you all these?\u201dThis had all been beaten into him by Grand Mentor Qi\u2019s ruler.6\u00a0Instead of answering, Shen Zechuan asked, \u201cSo why were you waiting for me by the palace gates today?\u201dXiao Chiye looked on as the maidservant served the wine dishes and waited until she closed the door before saying, \u201cWeren\u2019t you looking for me? You first.\u201d\u201cI noticed that you didn\u2019t enter the palace to seek an audience with the Emperor. You were busy working the entire night last night. I presumed you were at the torture prison.\u201d Shen Zechuan took a few sips of tea first to warm his body, then continued, \u201cFuling was an easy one to investigate, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d Xiao Chiye poured wine for himself. \u201cShe was such a breeze to investigate that she doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of person you should use.\u201d\u201cNot only does she have an elderly mother, but she is also soft-hearted. Someone like her with so many weaknesses to exploit is the easiest to manipulate, but also the most likely to change her tune.\u201d Shen Zechuan smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. If it were me, I\u2019d surely not use someone like her.\u201d\u201cBut Shen Lanzhou.\u201d Xiao Chiye stared at him as he drank, taking a moment to moisten his throat before saying, \u201cEven if you did use this kind of person, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m human too.\u201d Shen Zechuan took the wine jar from Xiao Chiye\u2019s side. \u201cI still have some feelings.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019ve reserved none of those feelings for me,\u201d Xiao Chiye lamented.Shen Zechuan poured wine slowly and said, \u201cSame goes for you.\u201d\u201cI reached out to you repeatedly.\u201d Xiao Chiye said with a genial expression. \u201cBut you turned a blind eye to my efforts, and even hardened your heart to fight it out with me, no?\u201d\u201cEven if you reach out, but only give me useless information,\u201d Shen Zechuan set down the wine jar before looking at him and continuing, \u201cthen wouldn\u2019t this alliance be too cheap of a deal?\u201d\u201cSo you turned around and allied with Xi Hongxuan.\u201d Xiao Chiye scoffed, \u201cWhat is he that he\u2019s even better than your Second Young Master?\u201d\u201cSecond Young Master was more impressive when he beat me down.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cYou can\u2019t blame a capable man for taking up the top position.\u201d\u201cHow could I bear to blame you?\u201d Xiao Chiye asked through the steam from the pot, \u201cAre you annoyed that you couldn\u2019t trample over me last night?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Shen Zechuan answered with a smile.\u201cSometimes your gaze is truly very ruthless.\u201d Before Shen Zechuan could reply, Xiao Chiye continued, \u201cBut of course, a little ruthlessness gives you flavor.\u201dShen Zechuan restrained himself for a moment before retorting, \u201cThen you have very special tastes.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not lacking either.\u201d Xiao Chiye made a double entendre. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve met someone who likes getting bitten.\u201d\u201cBack to the topic.\u201d Shen Zechuan diverted the course of conversation. \u201cWhy were you looking for me?\u201d\u201cTo have a drink.\u201d Xiao Chiye downed the wine in his cup. \u201cAnd to have a little chat while we\u2019re at it. The human broker on Donglong Street has a backer. However, we each minded our own business, so everyone has lived in harmony in the past. But now that they are framing this on me, I\u2019d naturally have to investigate the one backing them.\u201dShen Zechuan scooped a portion of the dish from the pot.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cHow strange that my investigation only led me to Xi Hongxuan. When we were here the last time, you even went out of your way to tell me that the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0would ally together to deal with me. But then you turned around and trampled on me together with the\u00a0Eight Great Clans. After thinking it over for a long time, I still couldn\u2019t figure out what your motives were. But as soon as I reversed the course of events, I understood.\u201dShen Zechuan ate the fish like a cat did\u2014neatly and beautifully. Without raising his head, he merely mumbled an \u201cuh-huh\u201d to indicate that he was listening.Xiao Chiye twirled the wine cup on the table and continued, \u201cI should have rearranged and put your scheme to \u2018trample me\u2019 before \u2018alliance with the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u2019. That way, everything would make sense. Your aim was not to bring me down at all. You incited Xi Hongxuan and urged him to ally with the other clans, but you also leaked news of it to me. You wanted me to react and use my authority of office over the Eight Great Training Divisions to convince the other clans not to ally with Xi Hongxuan. What do they call it? The art of political maneuvering?7\u00a0Using words alone to sow discord within and to sabotage the potential alliance of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0is but a trivial issue. Leaving bad blood between them from the subsequent fallout is the real prelude to the great task that you truly intend to undertake.\u201dShen Zechuan glanced at him and asked, \u201cDid you come up with this just from finding out that Xi Hongxuan was one of the backers of the human broker on Donglong Street?\u201d\u201cSome clues are like spider webs and horse tracks.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cYou can\u2019t wipe them clean. When Xi Gu\u2019an was held in the\u00a0Imperial Prison, Xi Hongxuan sold out the former\u2019s life in exchange for an official position. Now that I think of it, that should have been your suggestion too. Otherwise, Xi Hongxuan wouldn\u2019t heed your advice so readily.\u201dShen Zechuan wiped his fingers with a handkerchief and thought for a moment before saying, \u201cThe one who can make him listen to advice readily isn\u2019t me.\u201d\u201cI initially thought that you were in a hurry to be promoted so that it\u2019d be easier for you to investigate the case of Zhongbo troops\u2019 defeat.\u201d Xiao Chiye poured wine once more and continued, \u201cWho knew your appetite would be so great? What good would it do you to divide the\u00a0Eight Great Clans? You are well aware that\u00a0Qudu\u00a0is surrounded by the Eight Great Cities and that they have far outlasted the Li Clan. You\u2019ve seen Hua Siqian\u2019s rebellion at the hunting grounds and how big of a case it was, yet the Emperor Dowager has still emerged unscathed. How can you harbor the delusion of using the power of one man to break them up and oust them from power? Pry apart this mist of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0and take a good look underneath. You will see that they have already been standing tall for several hundred years with their roots deeply entrenched underground.\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s chopsticks came to a complete stop. When he sat upright, it felt as though he was about to launch into light intellectual conversations. He was not angry. In fact, he was very composed as he said, \u201cI\u2019ll only ask you one question.\u201dXiao Chiye paused for a moment before saying, \u201cGo ahead.\u201dShen Zechuan spoke, \u201cAll along, the Xiao Clan and Hua Clan have been holding each other back. Owing to the Nanlin Hunting grounds incident, the Hua Clan started to show signs of decline, while the Xiao Clan got the upper hand. But, did you win?\u201dXiao Chiye gripped his wine cup tightly.It was already dusk outside, but the lamps in the room were still not lit. Shen Zechuan\u2019s seated shadow before the window appeared frail. He said, \u201cYou\u2019ve quickly come to the realization that it\u2019s not just the Hua Clan you are facing. Perhaps in the beginning, you could still console yourself that they only want the Eight Great Training Divisions. But you only have to think of the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo to understand that what they want is far more than this.\u201d\u201cThere isn\u2019t a decisive ruling on the defeat of Zhongbo yet.\u201d Concealed in the dark, Xiao Chiye stayed silent for a brief while. \u201cAnd yet you\u2019re so sure that they are the ones who did it?\u201d\u201cThis is a bad debt.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through the case regarding the defeat of Zhongbo again and again with the intent to ascertain whose fault it was. But in fact, this was never a matter that a single person could control. Furthermore, there was one thing in the defeat that no one could quite figure out even to this date.\u201dXiao Chiye stated, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Why?\u201d Shen Zechuan affirmed his words. \u201cBiansha defeated the frontier and entered our territory, and everyone\u2019s morale and spirit took a beating. The tens of thousands of lives lost in Zhongbo was only a temporary issue. The dilemmas that followed also include the loss of years of taxes from the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo, the resettlement of the population, the redistribution of the farmlands, and the rebuilding of the massacred cities and towns. The State Treasury could not bear this burden, and so Zhongbo became the national debt. The most difficult part was the restructuring of the Garrison Troops. Without sufficient manpower, Zhongbo will be defeated once more. How much longer can the reinforcements from Libei and Qidong last? This directly concerns the safety of\u00a0Qudu. Did all these questions not pass through anyone\u2019s minds before the Zhongbo\u2019s troops defeat, or was it done precisely because these were expected? Perhaps the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0were not the main instigators, but without their power and influence, this sort of thing could not have been done either.\u201d\u201cThey are always involved each time there\u2019s political unrest in Dazhou. The turning point for Hua Clan\u2019s rise to power began twenty-five years ago while Emperor Guangcheng was on the throne. To fortify her power, the Empress Dowager killed the Crown Prince, a virtuous talent who observed propriety. But eighty years ago, during Emperor Yong\u2019an\u2019s time, the clan who held sway over the Imperial Court was the Yao, a prestigious clan that produced three talents. Even the Grand Secretariat was known as the \u2018Hall of Yao\u2019. Then, there was the Xi Clan who became the key to Dazhou\u2019s granaries when Juexi opened up Yongyi Harbor a hundred years ago. Making use of this opportunity to claim the gulf saltern of the Xu Sea to the west, they became the head of all the tycoons in the world. Even the Li Clan has to borrow money from them for the matrimony of their nobles. None of these happened because of personal scores. Rather, they were taking turns to be the leading powerhouse of the clans while Emperors came and went. Since the beginning, none of these clans have truly been on the decline.\u201d\u201cPoor households do not produce noble sons. Very few of Dazhou\u2019s significant officials who could influence the political situation of the imperial court were born from a poor family. How many years did it take for a Qi Huilian to surface? And how many years did it take for a Hai Liangyi to appear? They are just like a sloppy stroke of the brush that, despite having endured and making it this far, was also hastily brushed off as a mere mention in history.\u201d\u201cIf we must mention someone who is able to stand tall amidst the iron web of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans, then this man is someone you are most familiar with.\u201dShen Zechuan watched Xiao Chiye as he enunciated each word.\u201cThe Prince of Libei had a humble beginning and was born at the foot of the Hongyan Mountains. At the age of fifteen, he was drafted into the army at the Luoxia Pass, where he was promoted to the Luoxia Pass Garrison by age twenty. The Garrison Troops was defeated at the foot of the Hongyan Mountains when he was twenty-three. He went on to build the horse range of Luoxia at twenty-six and established the cavalry of Luoxia at twenty-eight. When he was thirty, he battled against the Biansha Hanshe tribe once more. He crossed the Hongyan Mountains by thirty-two and set foot all over the eastern Hongyan mountain range by thirty-five. From here onwards, the Luoxia Cavalry was disbanded and took on the name of Libei Armored Cavalry. No longer part of the Luoxia Pass Garrison, he was thrice bestowed and conferred the title of the different-surnamed Prince8\u00a0of Libei in Dazhou. The scale of Libei\u2019s Great Commandery was then determined, and Dazhou thus occupied the entire range of the Hongyan Mountains.\u201d\u201cThe war between the Xiao Clan and the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0is not only a power struggle, but also a battle between nobility and the common people. The man who had broken through the barrier to reach the peak was Xiao Fangxu. From a very long time ago, you and the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0were already at the stage of irreconcilable antagonism.\u201dShen Zechuan lowered his gaze slightly and arranged the bowl and chopsticks in front of him neatly. He said, \u201cTo ally with me, you have to bring forth a sincerity like mine at the very least, and not just a word or two about the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s accounts. Those are worthless to me.\u201dThe small screens isolated the sound of wind from them as both men sat each in their own posture opposite one another. The window lit up slightly, and the indistinct glow of snow gleamed upon both men\u2019s side profiles, reflecting the chills of the pitch-black night. Placed in opposition with one another,\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0and\u00a0Yang Shan Xue\u00a0were sheathed; yet the room still flashed with cold glints from the cutting edges of both blades.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 : In The Same Boat\u201cSounding somebody out is merely to test the waters.\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes were cold. \u201cHonest sincerity is like the process of undressing. It\u2019s only by proceeding in a proper sequence that we can come to have a heart-to-heart talk today. You are right. After the incident at the Nanlin Hunting Grounds, I thought that there would be changes to the Grand Secretariat led by Hai Liangyi. However, he still reused Xue Xiuzhuo of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans, putting him in an important post. This shows that even when he reached the position where he could overhaul the system, he still had to bow to the noble clans\u2019 power and influence. Under such circumstances, the Xiao Clan alone cannot do anything, much like one log alone cannot prop up an entire building.\u201d\u201cThen how should one describe them?\u201d Shen Zechuan pondered over it a little. \u201cWhen there is no common enemy, they are their own enemies. Keeping the balance and not letting the bowl of water overturn due to inherent bias is far more difficult than dealing with someone else. Before the Xiao Clan\u2019s appearance, the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0merely underwent internal change following the rise of one clan and the fall of another. But after the Xiao Clan surfaced, they began to separate the wheat from the chaff. The defeat of the Hua Clan is just temporary. The Imperial Court purged itself of the Hua Clan\u2019s remnants, but no one, not even Hai Liangyi, proposed to hold the Empress Dowager accountable. The current marriage alliance between the Hua and Qi Clans is to preserve the Hua Clan\u2019s usefulness and to whittle away external help that the Xiao Clan can seek. Some things, when seen on its own, might not necessarily tell you anything. It\u2019s only when the dots are connected that they will give you the shivers.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the defeat of the Zhongbo troops and the Hua-Qi marriage alliance?\u201d Xiao Chiye asked.\u201cThe strategy of befriending a distant state while attacking one nearby.\u201d1\u00a0Shen Zechuan extended a finger and drew a circle on the table. \u201cAfter taking down the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo, a void will open up in Libei\u2019s defense on the southwest side. Cizhou lies close to the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path, which is the lifeblood of Libei. With no one from Zhongbo to defend it now, it becomes the territory of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0of\u00a0Qudu. Bring the marriage alliance with the Qi Clan of Qidong into play, and you will be left high and dry with your back to Hongyan Mountains, the Biansha Tribes to the east, and double enemies to the south.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a five-year gap between both events. Who could have guaranteed that Hua Siqian would definitely rebel? And who could have ensured that I\u2019d surely come to the Emperor\u2019s rescue?\u201d Xiao Chiye slowly furrowed his eyebrows.\u201cThere must be a purpose for the defeat of Zhongbo\u2019s troops.\u201d Shen Zechuan said after a moment of silence. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to control the situation. The difficulty lies in controlling the direction in which the situation progresses. If my guess is right, then there is someone hidden among the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0who can control the way the wind blows.\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s really such a person,\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cthen it means that everyone is on the chessboard, and every step is within his anticipation. He is no longer a genius, but a \u2018God\u2019 who has Dazhou in his control. How are you going to fight him? The strategy of driving a wedge between the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0can\u2019t overcome the relationship forged through decades of marriage alliances between clans. They are inseparable in the face of public enemies.\u201d\u201cThe unpredictability of the turbulent tempest is better than the tranquility of the calm sea. It\u2019s only when the water is muddied that they won\u2019t be able to distinguish between friend or foe. In actuality, they are not invulnerable to attacks.\u201d Shen Zechuan retracted his finger and continued, \u201cHow is it that Xiao Fangxu was able to break through the noble clans\u2019 defenses? If this web is really tight enough, then how could significant ministers like Qi Huilian and Hai Liangyi rise in spite of their humble backgrounds? Your father was able to establish the Libei Armored Cavalry\u2019s predecessor, Luoxia Cavalry, because the officials of the Eastern Palace headed by the Crown Prince implemented the Yellow Register system2\u00a0to keep records of households. This enabled the frontiers to conscript soldiers for its troops. At the same time, it allowed the soldiers to have a hereditary household register3\u00a0so that they could belong under the jurisdiction of the commandery city\u2019s military. This separated it from the command of the\u00a0Qudu\u00a0noble clans\u2019 younger generation who have been appointed a post outside the capital, thereby allowing the Prince of Libei to unify military power so that he would no longer be subjected to the control and surveillance of the local civil officials. Not only that, the current well-trained and powerful army of Libei also has Dazhou\u2019s implementation of the state farm system4\u00a0to thank. You know better than I how important these military troops who carry out both garrison and farming duties5\u00a0are.\u201dWhy was Lu Guangbai having a harder time than Xiao Jiming?Because the Bianjun Commandery had no way of putting the policy of army farming into practice. The desert wastelands could not be cultivated to produce food, so Lu Guangbai could only rely on the subsidy of\u00a0Qudu\u2019s military funds and provisions. Deploying \u201c70% of the military troops for farming and 30% for military affairs and defense\u201d might not allow the frontier troops to achieve full self-sufficiency. But it still greatly reduced the pressure for provisions on the frontier troops. And this was of vital importance to the frontier troops.Grand Mentor Qi would rather pretend to be a lunatic if it allowed him to drag out an ignoble existence. Other than his unappeasable hatred, he was also loath to abandon the wounds that had been torn open. The Eastern Palace had dozens of subordinates, all of whom were officials from humble families the Crown Prince had personally hand-picked himself. To assist the Crown Prince, Qi Huilian forked out all that he had learned in his lifetime and invested it in him. Each word of \u201cthe die is cast\u201d he shouted with his hands raised five years ago was tears of blood that represented his inability to simply resign himself to it.\u201cYou encroach into my territory one step at a time, and indulge me again and again as I test your limit, all just for tonight\u2014to get me into the same boat as you.\u201d Xiao Chiye leaned forward slowly, his eyes cold. \u201cBut if I had not followed the trail to Xi Hongxuan tonight or figured out your purpose, would you really trample down on me and use me as a stepping board?\u201d\u201cYou are a wolf with a keen sense of smell.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cWhy do you make yourself out to be so pitiful? If I weren\u2019t me, you wouldn\u2019t give me a chance to step in at all. We wouldn\u2019t even be having a conversation. You and I are such a breed of people. Instead of asking me, why don\u2019t you ask yourself first?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cYou are an asshole.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to find like-minded assholes.\u201dXiao Chiye stopped contending with him and went straight to the point. He said, \u201cYou are now the one who wants to borrow and make use of my power. But one needs a little bargaining chip before a treaty of alliance can be established.\u201d\u201cWe share weal and woe.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cYour Yao Clan is about to be kicked out of the game soon. Doesn\u2019t that make you anxious, Second Young Master?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t use Yao Wenyu.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. The reason why the Yao Clan is on friendly terms with me is really not to vie for power. It\u2019s purely because Yao Wenyu is\u2026 Well, if you get to meet him, you\u2019ll understand. The reason he didn\u2019t enter the ranks of officials is not because Hai Liangyi couldn\u2019t bear to let him, but because he himself was unwilling. The members of the Yao Clan all used to be some important ministers in the past. It was only until his father\u2019s time that they started to fall into decline. But the remaining prestige of his grandfather is still present. They are a major clan highly respected among the literati, and their reputation among the civil officials is by no means something people like Hua Siqian could ever compare to. It\u2019s not difficult if he wants to make a comeback, but he\u2019s willing to be free and unrestrained like a wild crane rising above the drifting clouds. If Xi Hongxuan can really kick the Yao Clan out, then he will be all the more carefree and unfettered by worldly concerns.\u201d\u201cSeeing as the Yao Clan is already linked to the Fei Clan through a marriage alliance, then he is Commandery Princess Zhaoyue\u2019s elder cousin brother?\u201d Shen Zechuan asked suddenly.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Xiao Chiye picked up his chopsticks and confirmed. \u201cZhaoyue most likely wants to marry him, but Marquis Helian is so cowardly that he dances to the Empress Dowager\u2019s tune.\u201d\u201cThen perhaps both of you can become relatives.\u201d\u201cThe marriage fell through, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cYou sabotaged my marriage and cost me a beauty. Shouldn\u2019t you compensate me?\u201dShen Zechuan raised his eyebrows slightly.Xiao Chiye rinsed his chopsticks in the cold tea and lifted his eyes to look at him. He asked, \u201cDo you know that there is only a two-word difference between \u2018sharing a boat on the same river\u2019 and \u2018sharing a pillow on the same bed\u2019? If you ask me, there\u2019s no harm in mixing up these sayings, or even these actions, in the future.\u201dThe heat in the room smothered Shen Zechuan and made him slightly dizzy. Without replying, he turned to open the window.Xiao Chiye did not touch any of the dishes. Instead, he said, \u201cI brought you here, let you eat my dishes, drink my wine, and you aren\u2019t even the least suspicious?\u201dShen Zechuan looked at Xiao Chiye. The caress of the cool wind finally made him feel a little parched and hot. Thin sweat materialized. His fair neck lay within that tightly fastened collar of his, and the red plums leaning down from the window complimented his black hair, making him look all the more indescribably ravishing.Salt-like snow drifted outside the window, and some fell along the window onto the back of Shen Zechuan\u2019s hand, where they quickly melted into a splotch of water. This bit of coolness made the heat in his body even more distinct. In his trance, Shen Zechuan really had some other thoughts\u2014he wanted to undo his clasps.\u201cThis clause is not part of the alliance treaty.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cAnd I\u2019ve no shortage of people to warm my bed of late.\u201dXiao Chiye put up his long legs and said, \u201cRight now, you don\u2019t look like the kind of person who has no shortage of people to warm your bed. Work and personal affairs are separate matters. Now that we\u2019re done talking about work, we can slowly straighten out our personal affairs. Was the one from Ouhua Pavillion last time given to you by Xi Hongxuan? I heard he only likes ladies. Since when has he changed his taste too?\u201d\u201cHomosexual relationships between men are no longer uncommon.\u201d Shen Zechuan replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know if his taste has changed. Why? Has the Second Young Master\u2019s taste changed?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a fixed taste.\u201d Xiao Chiye picked up the hair hanging down before Shen Zechuan\u2019s knees. \u201cIt always depends on my mood.\u201dShen Zechuan lifted a finger to pull back his hair that was already matted with sweat. He said, \u201cSome people make themselves out to be romantic and charming. They look like they can conduct themselves in an orderly manner when, in fact, they only know how to gorge themselves ravenously. They must have been out of practice.\u201dXiao Chiye pushed aside the small table and grasped the wrist Shen Zechuan was about to pull back. He said, \u201c\u2026 And some people look so pitiful when they are drenched in sweat.\u201dThe heat in Shen Zechuan persisted, and the spot that Xiao Chiye was holding onto scalded him intensely. Propping himself up with an arm on his knee, Shen Zechuan demanded, \u201cWhat drug did you add?\u201d\u201cMake a guess.\u201d Xiao Chiye tugged Shen Zechuan on the wrist. Changing the topic, he said, \u201cJi Gang isn\u2019t up to teaching you such stuff, so who is your\u00a0shifu\u2026 or should I say, teacher?\u201dThe corners of Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes reddened as he replied softly, \u201cI\u2019m not telling you.\u201dXiao Chiye took a light sniff from a short distance away and suddenly said, \u201cYou smell so good.\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s breathing quickened as he countered, \u201cHave you reached the stage where you\u2019d use your beauty to ensnare a man?\u201d6\u201cI\u2019m far from being a \u2018beauty\u2019. Why? Just a little chat, and you\u2019re getting impatient?\u201dSweat soaked through Shen Zechuan\u2019s inner garment. His heat, tempted by this ambiguous atmosphere that had taken shape for no rhyme or reason, turned even more sticky and damp. He wanted to wipe his sweat. Frowning, he asked, \u201cWhat exactly did you add?\u201dXiao Chiye laughed aloud and said flirtatiously, \u201cJust fooling around with you. It\u2019s just medicinal wine.\u201dShen Zechuan found his gaze extremely dangerous. He could not help but close his eyes and force himself to stay calm. He said, \u201cXiao\u2019Er\u2014\u201dXiao Chiye raised his cup and downed the cold wine. At Shen Zechuan\u2019s words, he suddenly bent his head down and covered his lips. Shen Zechuan was pushed back towards the window, and the plum blossom branch shook on contact. He leaned back slightly, feeling like his waist was going to break under the tight hold. Some snow fell on Xiao Chiye\u2019s nape, but he ignored it. Half of his body was almost pressing down on Shen Zechuan. His fingers pushed their way through the gaps between Shen Zechuan\u2019s fingers, forcibly interlocking them together.Ever since that glance at the Feast of A Hundred Officials, Xiao Chiye had already wanted to kiss him! He wanted to even more so during their night talk today; he had already been enduring and restraining himself for an entire night. Xiao Chiye saw how ruthless and merciless he was, and how he could retreat and advance as he pleased. He could not get a feel of him among the myriad sensations, and so he only wanted to pin him down and kiss him until he was flushed all over with desire brimming in his eyes.Shen Zechuan\u2019s chest heaved. The wind had blown through his entire body of sweat, chilling him so much that he shuddered. His teeth could not stop the wine that Xiao Chiye was feeding him. As it slid to his throat, he started to choke. But Xiao Chiye was biting the tip of his tongue, preventing him from coughing it out. So all he could do was to endure it until his eyes watered. Even if the sky were to fall right at this moment, Xiao Chiye would not release him.A sudden \u201cthud\u201d rang out above, and someone tumbled down immediately after. Ding Tao plunged headlong into the pile of snow, then abruptly popped out his head. It was so freezing cold that he rubbed his arms hard. About to give someone a piece of his mind, he raised his head and came face-to-face with the window. He could not help but gape in shock, frightened out of his soul.Shen Zechuan instantly kicked Xiao Chiye away and held on to the window, coughing. The back of his ears were all flushed, and his mouth was saturated with the fragrance of wine. Xiao Chiye\u2019s breathing was a little urgent as he looked darkly out of the window.Ding Tao\u2019s teeth chattered as they fought against each other. Trembling, he stretched out his forefinger slowly to point up and whispered, \u201cSo-so-sorry, Young Master\u2026\u201dAbove them, Qiao Tianya and Gu Jin held their breaths and looked on with rapt attention as they wisely pretended not to be there. Without waiting for Xiao Chiye to say a word, Ding Tao sprang up and fled. He climbed the tree with swift movements, then made his way back to the roof with a 'swoosh\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 : Commander-in-ChiefIn the darkness, Xiao Chiye used his thumb to wipe the corner of his mouth, where there was still residual wine. He said, \u201cOne kick for one kiss. Neither of us loses out.\u201dShen Zechuan turned back to look at him.Xiao Chiye smiled at him. \u201cEach is a horse of a different color; let\u2019s not confuse them. Aren\u2019t you still going to trample on me in public in the future? Go ahead and step on me, Lanzhou. I\u2019ll pay each debt back in full plus interest.\u201dShen Zechuan used his tongue to wet the spot he had been bitten and told him, \u201cYou won\u2019t have this kind of opportunity every single time.\u201dXiao Chiye took a step closer, completely shrouding him under his own shadow. He replied, \u201cAnd you won\u2019t be able to run away every single time.\u201dHaving said that, Xiao Chiye extended his hand to pluck the red plum beside Shen Zechuan. He rubbed the petals into mush and sent that redness into his mouth. Under his gaze, Shen Zechuan had the illusion that he himself was that red plum. In his evaluation of Xiao Chiye, he quietly added \u201chaving the determination to win\u201d in addition to having a \u201ckeen sense of smell\u201d.Shen Zechuan once thought that desire would overcome Xiao Chiye and make him retreat from the setback. But Xiao Chiye\u2019s behavior was beyond Shen Zechuan\u2019s expectation. That arrogant character of his meant that he only knew how to march forward bravely. Any retreat or concession was only in preparation for the next time he made a better-planned attack.He was an overwhelmingly dangerous threat.\u201cLight the lamps.\u201d Xiao Chiye turned his head to shout out.After a short moment, the maidservants pushed the door open and entered. They moved out a small screen, cleared away the leftovers, spread a mat over the rug, and swapped to a big, square tea table with girdled waist and horse hooves\u2019 legs.1\u00a0Chen Yang changed his shoes and entered. He placed the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s military affairs and name register of personnel on the tea table, then took over the teapot from the maidservant\u2019s hands and kneeled at the side to steep tea for both men.With someone else present, both men resumed the roles of upright gentlemen when they took their seats again.Shen Zechuan had partially sobered up. Bathing in the wind had helped him break free of his earlier hot flushes and tipsiness. Only the scarlet on his face remained, further accentuated by the dim light of the lamp that enveloped him. Even Chen Yang did not dare to look straight up at him, for fear that his gaze would be an affront to both Shen Zechuan and Xiao Chiye, making them displeased.Chen Yang brewed the tea and thought,\u00a0no wonder Tantai Hu is worried. Shen Lanzhou is clearly born with the looks of one capable of bringing ruin to the nation and misfortune upon the commoners. What\u2019s more, he has such a temperament. Anyone who is on familiar terms with Master, even a little, should be afraid.What was Xiao Chiye most fond of?Taming horses and tormenting eagles!2\u00a0During the tormenting process, Xiao Chiye would not sleep when the eagle wasn\u2019t sleeping. The harder it was to tame, the more attention he would pay it. The harder it was to domesticate, the more he would favor it. Back then, while they were fighting the Biansha Cavalry, Xiao Chiye could lay in wait for so long simply because he adored the process of domestication and torture. He inherited from Xiao Fangxu the desire to conquer and subjugate, far surpassing that of the common man. This was the most different trait between him and Xiao Jiming.Chen Yang presented the tea to both of them, made a slight bow, and said, \u201cIf Master has any instructions, please call for me.\u201d Then he rose and retreated to change back into his boots and stand guard outside the door.Gu Jin hung his head down from the rooftop, tossed a wine bag to Chen Yang, and cast him an inquiring gaze to ask about the inside situation.Chen Yang slowly exhaled and said, \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s all fine. Master has a measure of propriety.\u201dDing Tao was still hugging his head and murmuring, \u201cAm I going to die, die, die\u2026\u201d\u201cHard to say.\u201d Qiao Tianya nudged against the snow to pull out his pipe and laughed out loud. \u201cOn this day next year,\u00a0gege\u00a0will remember to burn paper offerings for you.\u201dDing Tao\u2019s tears were about to fall. Grabbing his hair, he glared at them in anger and complained, \u201cIt\u2019s all you two\u2019s fault! If you didn\u2019t fight, I wouldn\u2019t have tried to break up the fight. If I didn\u2019t intervene, then I wouldn\u2019t have tumbled off. If I didn\u2019t fall, then I wouldn\u2019t die! I hate you both!\u201dQiao Tianya concentrated wholeheartedly on starting a fire with the flint, while Gu Jin folded his arm and dozed off.Ding Tao hated them so much that he fished out his book and jotted at high speed to vent all his fury within, cussing them both as the world\u2019s greatest bastards. Once done, he wiped the tears at the corners of his eyes, then turned around to continue venting his thoughts as they gushed forth like spring water.Having had a change of tea, the men in the room continued their discussion.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cReturning to the topic, you said that there is someone hiding in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0who is able to manipulate the\u00a0Eight Great Clans. I thought about it and found it highly unlikely.\u201dThat medicinal wine burned up Shen Zechuan\u2019s throat so much that it was billowing smoke. He drank several cups of tea before saying, \u201cYou think it is not possible because it is too difficult to do such a thing effectively.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Let\u2019s leave the others aside for now. Even the Empress Dowager herself would not deign to listen to the directions of another.\u201d\u201cWhat if she wasn\u2019t aware of it herself?\u201d Shen Zechuan asked, \u201cSometimes, you don\u2019t need to command others in order to manipulate the situation. With just one finger, you can nudge the \u2018powers\u2019 into action and change a lot of things from there.\u201d\u201cYou have to prove the existence of this person first.\u201d Xiao Chiye looked at him and said, \u201c\u2026 You look like you\u2019re feeling quite warm.\u201dShen Zechuan lifted his fingers to undo his clasp. That clasp gently broke free of its fastener to gradually reveal his smooth neck between his fingers before coming to a stop at the top of his collarbone. Tiny beads of sweats slid along the contour of his neck into that depression, wetting his fingertips.\u201cAlthough Xi Hongxuan is a chess piece in the open, he\u2019s very important. Xi Hongxuan is needed to confirm whether this person exists or not, so you can\u2019t take him off the game this time.\u201d Shen Zechuan paused for a moment. \u201cYou can\u2019t take him down, anyway. He never once showed himself during this assassination case. Fuling\u2019s confession can only prove that she was coerced. And the most likely suspect is now you.\u201d\u201cIt was your idea to frame it on me.\u201d Xiao Chiye looked at that disappearing bead of sweat.\u201cYou are now an official in the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u2019s inner ministerial circle, one deeply favored by the Emperor. If this incident can remove you from position and put you off duty, Xi Hongxuan will not pass up the chance. He will definitely try to seize an opportunity to seek the Eight Great Training Divisions\u2019 authority of office. It\u2019s only by luring them out of their lairs that we can get a clearer look at whom to attack. Besides, His Majesty trusts you. Even if he demotes you, he will not immediately and easily put his trust in others. After a period of time, he will see the blazing rise of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u2019 power and arrogance, and he will realize that he had been played for a fool. He will instead harbor guilt towards the innocent ones who have been implicated, and then he will try ways to make it up to you.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed as he drank the tea. He said, \u201cMy guess is that you had already thought of a countermeasure before you came to me.\u201d\u201cSure, let\u2019s play.\u201d Xiao Chiye poured tea for him. \u201cI\u2019ll merely be beating you at your own game and letting you guys trample on me.\u201d\u201cThis is much wiser than fighting back at this point.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cThe more anxious you are at this time to clear your name and involvement in this matter, the more suspicious His Majesty will be.\u201d\u201cI know His Majesty.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cHe is a credulous man and easily susceptible to persuasion. He cannot stand being instigated,3\u00a0 but he cannot stand being humiliated either. I\u2019m his buddy, and the first person he promoted to his side after he ascended to the throne. I\u2019m kind of a symbol for the way he faces his court officials. Trapped both on the inside and the outside, I\u2019ve become livestock in his hands\u2014one that he penned in and raised. To him, I\u2019ve no one to rely on, and it\u2019s only with his backing that I can secure this position of mine. If someone were to scheme against me, thereby kicking me down, then he will definitely have the feeling of sharing the same fate, just like how teeth feel cold when the lips are gone.4\u00a0The Hua Faction is his sore point and the source of his anxiety. The reason he feels reassured in getting Hai Liangyi to make decisions regarding government affairs is because he knows that Hai Liangyi will not form cliques or join political factions.\u201d\u201cWe mustn\u2019t let such a golden opportunity slip.\u201d Shen Zechuan held his teacup and considered it for a moment before saying, \u201cThis time, we must make Xi Hongxuan take action.\u201d\u201cI have to remind you of one thing.\u201d Xiao Chiye propped up his elbow on the table and beckoned to Shen Zechuan.Shen Zechuan put down his teacup and leaned over.Xiao Chiye whispered, \u201cIf you can\u2019t hold your liquor, then don\u2019t go drinking with others. Not every bastard has Second Young Master\u2019s level of willpower to remain unswayed by distracting thoughts5\u00a0and remain an honorable, well-behaved gentleman before you.\u201dShen Zechuan looked askance at him and emphasized his words, \u201cBut this honorable gentleman has harbored quite the thoughts too, hasn\u2019t he?\u201dXiao Chiye gazed at him and said, \u201cOnce we step out of this door tomorrow morning, you and I will be mortal enemies. Since enemies know best how to hold each other in high regard, then isn\u2019t it only fitting for me to think of you?\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cI don\u2019t think of you.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cEvery plan you make these days can\u2019t escape me. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not that you don\u2019t think of me, but that you think of me day and night.\u201d\u201cHow did that kick from the Feast of A Hundred Officials not get to you?\u201d Shen Zechuan raised his hand to block Xiao Chiye\u2019s breath on him and said, \u201cIt could have sobered up the Second Young Master.\u201dThe tip of Xiao Chiye\u2019s nose was pressing against Shen Zechuan\u2019s palm. He stared at Shen Zechuan and said wickedly, \u201cHow callous, Lanzhou. You tease me in all ways possible before bedding me. And now that you\u2019ve bedded me, you set up defenses in every way possible to guard against me. You heartless cad, fickle man.\u201dHis gaze made Shen Zechuan slightly averted his eyes. Shen Zechuan said, \u201c\u2026\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er, you sure are drunk tonight, aren\u2019t you?\u201dXiao Chiye suddenly retreated and said, \u201cDuring the court session tomorrow morning, someone will surely raise questions and apportion blame. Kong Qiu will present Fuling\u2019s previous confession statement as it is. When the time comes, the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0will have to hold me accountable for my negligence in supervision.\u201dWith his palm now empty, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cEven if you wish to take a step back, you can\u2019t make it too obvious.\u201d\u201cOnce I\u2019m caught in a vicious siege of verbal and written condemnation, it\u2019ll be up to His Majesty to decide on my punishment.\u201d Xiao Chiye said.\u201cAt best, your salary will be halted for a few months. At worst, your tablet will be suspended and you will have to reflect on your mistake. The\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0is still in\u00a0Qudu. Everyone still has to give him face, so they won\u2019t overdo their criticism of you.\u201d\u201cDage\u2019s time in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0is very short.\u201d Xiao Chiye stopped. \u201cOnce I\u2019m punished, there\u2019ll be no one else to stop the marriage between Hua Xiangyi and Qi Shiyu.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll take time for the union between Qi and Hua to happen.\u201d Shen Zechuan thought for a moment. \u201cThe current Commander-in-chief of Qidong Five Commandery military troops is Qi Zhuyin. Perhaps we can start with her.\u201dXiao Chiye thought of something and said, \u201cI have an idea.\u201dShen Zechuan asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe Ministry of Rites has past marriage records of the Hua Clan. I\u2019ll get someone to polish it up a little, then give this transcribed copy to Qi Zhuyin. She will not accept Hua Xiangyi easily.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not taboo for distant relatives to marry in Dazhou; even marriage between cousins is fine.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cOr is Commander-in-Chief Qi bothered by it?\u201d\u201cShe is.\u201d Xiao Chiye explained. \u201cAs we all know, Qi Shiyu is a lecher, and he has taken many beautiful women all over Qidong Five Commandery into his residence as his women. One of them is his niece. A few years back, this madam gave birth to a baby, who was born with a defect and was abnormally sick and weak. The baby lasted for only a few days before it was buried. From then on, each time Qi Shiyu takes in a concubine, Qi Zhuyin would be particularly wary of breaking this taboo. As long as there were some blood relations between them, even if she was a distant relative, Qi Zhuyin would not allow the woman to marry into the family.\u201d\u201cBut Hua Xiangyi\u2019s marriage to Qi Shiyu was specifically dictated by the Empress Dowager herself.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cI doubt the Commander-in-Chief can stop it even if she wants to.\u201d\u201cSince there\u2019s already no way she can stop it, then she can only take a step back to make a concession and let Hua the Third marry.\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes were cold. \u201cBut she can\u2019t let her give birth to a child. Hua Xiangyi is marrying Qi Shiyu as his second wife, which means she will be the legitimate and rightful madam of Qidong. The child she gives birth to will be a child of lawful birth6\u00a0who can claim to be of the same direct line of descent as Qi Zhuyin. Qi Zhuyin is a woman. It\u2019s indeed not easy for her to subdue and bring Qidong Five Commandery military forces under her control for all these years. She is a great general who has truly shed blood. But who can guarantee that no one will have something else in mind? If Hua Xiangyi were to give birth to a son, Qi Zhuyin would have no choice but to be caught up in an internal struggle for military power. She is in need of a reason to suppress Hua Xiangyi.\u201d\u201cI heard that there are male sons in the Qi Clan. But Qi Shiyu was hell-bent on having his own way to give to Qi Zhuyin the Commander-in-Chief position of the military forces.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cWasn\u2019t this out of an appreciation for talents?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cQi Zhuyin was born by his first legitimate wife, and she is also a talented field commander he personally taught. When he still had no sons, he treated and raised Qi Zhuyin as one. He came to have sons later on, but none of them could be compared to her. At that time, Qidong was still at war with Biansha. Qi Shiyu was seriously injured and was unable to lead the troops. They were trapped at the east side of Biansha linked camps, and none of the Qi Clan sons dared to step up to take up the mantle. It was Qi Zhuyin who carried a blade on her back and rode a horse through the night to go canvassing for reinforcements from the Chijun Commandery, Bianjun Commandery, and Suotian Pass Garrison Troops and got them to follow her into battle. Then, with the help of the wind, she set fire to the Biansha linked camps and burned them all down. This was the battle that made her famous. She\u2019s now called \u2018Wind Guiding the Scorching Plains\u2019 precisely because of how she led the soldiers that battle to draw their swords while braving the fire to carry out Qi Shiyu on her back. Qi Shiyu was originally hesitant and undecided. But after that time, he immediately handed over the commander seal and gave the Five Commandery military troops all to Qi Zhuyin.\u201d\u201cThe conferment of the Commander-in-Chief title requires the approval of\u00a0Qudu.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy feat to achieve.\u201dXiao Chiye smiled. He touched the thumb ring on his thumb and said, \u201cYou would have never imagined that Emperor Guangcheng was not the one who conferred the title on her.\u201dShen Zechuan tilted his head slightly.\u201cBack then, when news of it spread back to\u00a0Qudu, the various parties all denounced it. Because Qi Zhuyin is a woman, the Ministry of War questioned whether her military exploits were fabricated. Thus, they submitted a petition to the Grand Secretariat requesting them to dispatch the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0Censor and\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0to Qidong to carry out a thorough investigation. Seeing how worked up the crowd was, Emperor Guancheng delayed Qidong\u2019s request and did not approve it. Her meritorious military service was later verified, and the Ministry of Rites submitted a memorial allowing her conferment. However, she was not allowed up Yulong Terrace,7\u00a0which is used by military officers and generals, to receive her conferment. She could only kneel and kowtow before the stairs of Mingli Hall.\u201dXiao Chiye paused for a long time.\u201cIt was the Empress Dowager who stood her ground against the objections and obstacles and allowed her to step onto Yulong Terrace so that she could be conferred, in an open and aboveboard manner, the title Commander-in-Chief of Qidong\u2019s military forces.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 : DenouncementWhite snow fell in a flurry. The night was coming to an end.Shen Zechuan could not stay any longer. Just as he was leaving, Xiao Chiye rose to his feet, took down the overcoat from the rack, and handed it to him.\u201cThis blade of yours looks unfamiliar.\u201d Xiao Chiye bent over to pick up\u00a0Yang Shan Xue. It felt light and handy in his hands. \u201cNew?\u201dShen Zechuan nodded and faced the door as he put on the overcoat.Xiao Chiye pressed the sword slightly out of its sheath with his thumb to reveal a cold glint. He said, \u201cExcellent blade. What\u2019s its name?\u201dShen Zechuan answered, \u201cYang Shan Xue.\u201d\u201cA lift of its head, and three mountains worth of snow it spouts; a spread of its mouth, and a hundred rivers it devours.\u201d1\u00a0Xiao Chiye returned the blade to its sheath and took a step forward and stuck to Shen Zechuan from behind. With practiced fingers, he put back\u00a0Yang Shan Xue\u00a0to the side of Shen Zechuan\u2019s waist. He lowered his head slightly and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not only pretty; even the name is pretty.\u201dShen Zechuan abruptly looked back, but Xiao Chiye beat him to it and grasped him by the waist to take him into his arms.\u201cHow are you going to look at me after leaving here today?\u201d\u201cHowever I ought to be looking at you.\u201d Shen Zechuan hurriedly turned his head back. It looked as if he was intimately rubbing their faces together.\u201cIf you can\u2019t handle it, you can always ask your Second Young Master for help.\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s fingers roughly obtained a measurement as he smiled and said.\u201cThe Second Young Master can barely fend for himself.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cSeems more likely for you to ask me for help.\u201dXiao Chiye released him and said, \u201cYou are much thinner than the last time. If my guess is right, you are still taking medicine that can conceal your figure.\u201dShen Zechuan fastened his overcoat and said nothing.\u201cLet me offer you a word of advice,\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThat medicine hurts the body the more you take it. In a few years, it\u2019ll be your own body that will be wrecked.\u201dShen Zechuan sighed softly as he stopped by the door. \u201cYour\u00a0shifu\u00a0has sharp eyes. He met me only once, and he could tell just by looking.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cYou\u2019re willing to go to such an extent just for these matters?\u201d\u201cMy life and death hang in the balance at the mere whim of another, so naturally, I\u2019d have to exercise caution in everything I do and pay due diligence everywhere I go.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s hands were ice cold. He said, \u201cI\u2019ve practiced the Ji Clan boxing style for a long time. I wouldn\u2019t be able to deceive Ji Lei unless I resort to this.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cJi Lei is already dead.\u201dShen Zechuan still smelled a little of wine. He said, \u201cI\u2019ve stopped taking the medicine.\u201dAfter Shen Zechuan had left, Xiao Chiye stood in the blizzard as he recalled Zuo Qianqiu\u2019s words.\u201cThis medicine comes from the East. Once taken, a person can fake illness to pull the wool over the eyes of others. It\u2019s not a problem if it\u2019s taken once or twice, but it could cause serious consequences if consumed for a long time. The damage is negligible if the toxin remains in the body for a short while, but it\u2019ll eventually act up in the future.\u201d\u201cAct up?\u201dZuo Qianqiu fixed his gaze on the teacup in his hand and said, \u201cToxin accumulates to become a malady that harms. If he doesn\u2019t take good care of it, he might be rendered invalid when the time comes.\u201dXiao Chiye raised his hand and let the windstorm blow away the lingering warmth on his palm. He reminisced back to that night when he thought he had almost melted Shen Zechuan with his caresses, but it seemed that the warmth he gave Shen Zechuan was merely fleeting.A beauty always gives off the illusion of fragility.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8With a bamboo hat on his head, Qiao Tianya drove the horse carriage and rushed towards Shen Zechuan\u2019s old house on Donglong Street. Shen Zechuan leaned against the interior wall of the carriage and closed his eyes to take a nap.Upon reaching the entrance, Qiao Tianya commanded the horses to stop and lifted the curtain open for Shen Zechuan. Shen Zechuan bent over to get off the carriage and returned to his room to take a bath and have a change of clothes.According to the memorial, Shen Zechuan had enjoyed a meteoric rise this time to become a fifth-grade Judge of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0in just one leap. But this position was split into two\u2014the south and north. The Southern Judge was in charge of the affairs of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019 military craftsmen, while the Northern Judge was in charge of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019\u00a0Imperial Prison. Li Jianheng put him in an important position with the intent to use him. But the civil officials of the Grand Secretariat all had their own misgivings and considerations. Because of Shen Zechuan\u2019s background, they were not willing to let him take charge of the\u00a0Imperial Prison. Therefore, after everyone deliberated over it, they rejected Shen Zechuan\u2019s appointment as the Northern Judge and had it changed to the Southern Judge.For this reason, the Grand Secretariat raised Shen Zechuan\u2019s military appointment to one of a fifth-grade\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019 Battalion Commander. This was already a great honor, especially when coupled with the additional embroidered python robe2\u00a0and phoenix-tail belt3\u00a0that Li Jianheng had bestowed upon him.Shen Zechuan had long anticipated the Grand Secretariat\u2019s rebuttal.This time, he had made his way up by using Han Cheng as a stepping stone. As per their agreement, Xue Xiuzhuo let him have his promotion, yet he gave him a kick at the most crucial part. This was to make him understand that even if he had the merit that came with going to the Emperor\u2019s rescue, he was still far from being able to cross swords with them.When Shen Zechuan emerged all neatly dressed, Qiao Tianya was holding up an umbrella. The latter said, \u201cWith Master\u2019s promotion, this house is already considered simple and shabby. It would not be able to accommodate all the coming and going visitors in the future.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry.\u201d Shen Zechuan lifted his robe to get on the carriage. As he dropped the curtain, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s still not too late to change it after I\u2019m promoted to Commander-in-Chief.\u201dWith that, the curtain drooped, and he continued to rest.The weather was bad today. The officials waiting outside the palace all had snow on their shoulders. They could not walk around as they please, nor could they move at will. They could not make a racket either, or even cough.Shen Zechuan followed Han Cheng to stand at attention while bearing his blade. His skin was like icy snow set against the contrast of his crimson python robe. He was shockingly gorgeous whenever there was a smile in the corners of his eyes. Yet, amidst that affability, he gave off an air of malice that spoke of danger.Xiao Chiye was donning a red robe too. The second-grade lion on his body4\u00a0made him stand out even more from the crowd, like a crane among a flock of fowls. He looked to be in low spirits and merely glanced askance at Shen Zechuan.Both men were standing apart from one another, yet they gave others the sense that they were facing off each other in a confrontation. Even Hai Liangyi turned his head aside to take a few looks.The civil officials made eye contact with one another, each coming to a mutual, tacit understanding.A little while later, Han Cheng said in a hushed tone, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dWhen those palace doors opened, the eunuchs from the\u00a0Directorate of Ceremonial\u00a0and major ministers of the Grand Secretariat would be the first to enter. But now that the\u00a0Directorate of Ceremonial\u00a0had been vacated, only the important ministers of the Grand Secretariat with Hai Liangyi at the head went on ahead. Han Cheng followed behind them, leading Shen Zechuan up the stairs to take up position at the lower left side of the dragon throne.Li Jianheng sat on the dragon throne with both hands on his knees and said, \u201cIt has been two nights since the assassination case. Has there been any new progress from the Ministry of Justice?\u201dThe Minister of Justice, Kong Qiu, stepped out and said after paying his obeisances, \u201cTo reply Your Majesty, the evidence against Fuling, the female official of the Imperial Food Service, in instigating Guisheng to carry out the assassination is conclusive. This subject will hand her over to the Court of Judicial Review for a retrial today.\u201dFor some reason, Li Jianheng cast a glance at Xiao Chiye and turned back to continue asking, \u201cHave you gotten to the bottom of why she did this?\u201dKong Qiu said, \u201cOur checks show that Fuling once broke the imperial plate of the Court of Imperial Entertainments in the palace. Consequently, this left a record in her file, and, to work it off, the day she could leave the palace was put off to the indefinite future. She often told the others that her mother was already advanced in age, and she wanted to leave the palace to wait upon the latter, but owing to the palace rules, she was unable to do so. She repeatedly bribed the former Brush-holding Director of the\u00a0Directorate of Ceremonial, but it was a wasted effort, and she was cheated out of her entire life savings. And so she lost it and began to harbor the intent to exact revenge.\u201d\u201cThis subject has a memorial to present.\u201d The Vice Minister of the Court of Judicial Review, Wei Huaixing, was the second son of lawful birth of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u2019 Wei Clan. He was also the elder brother of Imperial Concubine Wei during Emperor Xiande\u2019s time. He stepped out and paid his obeisances.Li Jianheng said, \u201cYour Excellency Wei, please speak.\u201d\u201cThis subject has ascertained that the female official of the Imperial Food Service, Fuling, had a power-for-sex transaction with Yuan Liu from the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s Judicial Office. It was Yuan Liu who personally stepped forward to negotiate credit for the house where her mother lived.\u201d Without looking at anyone, Wei Huaixing continued, \u201cThis case is presided over by the Ministry of Justice, and this matter concerns Your Majesty\u2019s safety; It cannot be said to be unimportant. Yet, Minister Kong mentioned only half of the confession before Your Majesty. Is there something that cannot be said, or someone who cannot be incriminated?\u201dKong Qiu turned his head to the side and said, \u201c\u2026 This matter is mentioned all in my memorial, so what deception is there to speak of?\u201d\u201cThe\u00a0morning court\u00a0is an important venue for the discussion of governmental affairs. His Majesty asked if you have gotten to the bottom of it. Yet you were evasive before all the officials, focusing on what\u2019s favorable while skipping the damning statements.\u201d Wei Huaixing raised his head. \u201cOfficials, on entering service, should diligently and earnestly serve with utmost loyalty.5\u00a0The imperial court hall is by no means a place to condone corruption and abet corrupted officials. What are you afraid of? If you don\u2019t dare to voice it in the person\u2019s presence, then I\u2019ll say it. Your Majesty, this matter concerns not only the various\u00a0twenty-four yamen\u00a0in the Imperial Palace, but also the\u00a0Imperial Army!\u201dXiao Chiye looked displeased, as if he were sneering.Li Jianheng had initially meant to keep it under wraps. But now, it would not do for him to continue fooling the others. After hesitating for a long time, he said, \u201c\u2026 Ce\u2019 an, what do you have to say to this?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0has 20,000 men on its payroll. This subject can check their household registers one at a time, but not all of their personal affairs one by one. This time, I\u2019m at fault for being negligent in my supervision of my men. Your Majesty may punish me as you deem fit.\u201dLi Jianheng wanted to open his mouth to say a word.Wei Huaixing kowtowed first and said, \u201cViceroy Xiao, why aren\u2019t you telling the truth before His Majesty either? It\u2019s indeed true that it\u2019s not easy to probe into the personal affairs of the 20,000 men in the\u00a0Imperial Army. But that Yuan Liu doesn\u2019t have a common relationship with you at all. So how can you feign ignorance too?!\u201dShen Zechuan looked over.\u201cThere are too many people who have special relationships with me.\u201d Xiao Chiye swept a glance at Shen Zechuan and smiled without a care. \u201cBut with a beauty in my arms, I\u2019d be blind to bed an old fellow. That Yuan Liu is old enough to be your father. Your Excellency Wei, never mind if you don\u2019t have any proof or evidence, but why go to this extent to bring such a false charge against me, Xiao Ce\u2019 an?\u201dHai Liangyi gave a slight cough and said, \u201cPlease watch your language on the Imperial Court, Viceroy.\u201d\u201cHis Majesty is fully aware of the kind of jerk I am. I have never needed to put on false pretenses here.\u201d Xiao Chiye was a tyrant when he played the scoundrel. He did not even show any respect to Hai Liangyi. \u201cYou want to investigate the\u00a0Imperial Army, sure thing. To steer clear of suspicion, I\u2019ll hand over my waist token and let the various Excellencies investigate. But if you want to pin that groundless, trumped-up charge on me, then sorry, I won\u2019t plead guilty.\u201d\u201cSuch vulgar language. Acting all rebellious before His Majesty. The Xiao Clan sure has produced a good son!\u201d Wei Huaixing took out a memorial from his sleeve. \u201cThe Viceroy says I\u2019ve no evidence or proof. But as an official of the Court of Judicial Review, how would I dare to say so if that\u2019s the case?\u201dXiao Jiming, who had been listening without moving all this while, slightly raised his head to look at Wei Huaixing, wanting to see what evidence the latter could have.Wei Huaixing said, \u201cYuan Liu was originally a Squad Commander of the\u00a0Imperial Army. It was the Viceroy who personally promoted him to be a Vice Judge. Not two years later, the Viceroy promoted him again into the position of a Judge. I\u2019d like to ask the Viceroy. These few years, the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0had no important duties. So on what grounds does he get to be promoted again and again?\u201dXiao Chiye sneered and said, \u201cHe\u2019s already at that age. Although he has no merits to speak of, he has committed no grave errors. The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0has been mass recruiting rookies in recent years. Yuan Liu isn\u2019t the only old-timer I\u2019ve promoted on account of old ties. Why doesn\u2019t Your Excellency Wei list them all out clearly and count them all among my personal affairs?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the Viceroy\u2019s words the law in the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0in recent years?!\u201d Wei Huaixing said unhurriedly. \u201cThe one each of them pledged loyalty to is the Xiao Clan, not His Majesty, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHis words were laced with double layers of meaning\u2014In itself, it referred to Xiao Chiye, but it also implicated Xiao Jiming.As expected, Xiao Chiye flipped. He said, \u201cKeep the discussion to the topic at hand. Stop fucking bringing in the Xiao Clan at every mention! I, Xiao Ce\u2019an, followed His Majesty to the position I am at now. I\u2019m not like Your Excellency Wei who is born with a silver spoon in his mouth and with his path to officialdom all smoothly paved out for him.\u201dIt was only when Wei Huaixing saw Xiao Chiye losing his temper that he opened the memorial and said, \u201cThe Viceroy went drinking with others before the new year. During the feast, Yuan Liu gifted you a large sum of money. Does the Viceroy admit to this?\u201dEven Li Jianheng was stunned the moment this word was spoken. He clenched his fist and said nothing further.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cI have never gone drinking with Yuan Liu before.\u201d\u201cThe courtesans of Xiangyun Villa on Donglong Street can attest to it. That night, Yuan Liu spent a large sum of money to entertain the Viceroy. The Viceroy got drunk during the feast, and Yuan Liu gifted you a basket of golden peaches.\u201d Wei Huaixing said, \u201cDoes the Viceroy still not admit it?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cI\u2019ll just ask you. Yuan Liu is a minor sixth-grade official. Where on earth would he get the golden peaches to gift?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s something we will have to ask the Viceroy.\u201d Wei Huaixing finally took out his killing move. He said, \u201cThe same time Yuan Liu got the house on credit for Fuling, he also got three street-facing houses on Donglong Street on credit. I have ascertained that he acted upon the Viceroy\u2019s written instructions at that time! In recent years, the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0first carried out repairs on its barracks, then expanded the military drill grounds on Mount Feng. Where did all the money for these come from? Wasn\u2019t it the Viceroy who used his position in the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0to obtain it illegally from the broker? Yuan Liu was the one who handled and completed this matter for you. And now that Yuan Liu has instigated Fuling to assassinate His Majesty, do you dare to say that it has nothing to do with you?\u201dXiao Chiye did not answer.Fu Linye, the Right Censor-in-chief\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau, stepped out and said, \u201cThis subject also has a memorial to submit.\u201dFor some reason, Li Jianheng\u2019s fingertips were trembling violently. He commanded, \u201cSpeak!\u201dFu Linye said, \u201cThis subject wants to bring charges against the Viceroy of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0too today. According to the law, before the Joint Trial by the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices\u00a0concludes, no irrelevant person is allowed to enter the torture prison to visit major criminals unless he has His Majesty\u2019s imperial edict. Yet, the Viceroy acted on his own initiative and went to the torture prison yesterday without an imperial edict and made no report of it afterward.\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s expression grew more and more somber.\u201cThe moment the Viceroy left the torture prison, Fuling\u2019s mother died.\u201d Fu Linye kowtowed. \u201cAs for what happened in between, I\u2019d like to ask the Viceroy to give a clear account of it in His Majesty\u2019s presence.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cBoth of you are really taking action at the same time, huh. Such coincidence!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t dodge the topic, Viceroy.\u201d Wei Huaixing said coldly, \u201cI\u2019d advise you to explain yourself at the earliest opportunity!\u201d\u201cHe who wants to incriminate a man will always trump up a charge against him.\u201d As if surrounded in a trap, Xiao Chiye fell silent for a moment, then said to Li Jianheng, \u201cI\u2019ve never done any of the stuff they said. I\u2019ll let His Majesty make the judgment tonight.\u201dUnder such a tense, anxious atmosphere, Li Jianheng clenched his knees until they were soaked with sweat. He looked at Xiao Chiye too, then suddenly asked, \u201cHow do you explain those written instructions?\u201dXiao Chiye lowered his gaze and said with a spurious smile, \u201cThis subject has never written such a thing.\u201dLi Jianheng stood up in an instant. He took a few steps forward impatiently and demanded, \u201cLet me see!\u201dWei Huaixing handed over the item. Li Jianheng flipped through it for a moment and suddenly began to tremble. His lips quivered. \u201cIsn\u2019t this your handwriting\u2026 Ce\u2026 Ce\u2019 an!\u201dXiao Chiye said resolutely, \u201cThis subject has never written such a thing!\u201dLi Jianheng was terrified. He set the document in his hands, then quickly threw it away like a hot potato. Nearly losing control, he asked, \u201cThen, that Yuan Liu\u2014is he your man or not?!\u201dXiao Chiye raised his eyes.Upon seeing this, Li Jianheng clutched onto the armrests. Fear began to rise within him. In this fleeting moment of dread, he recalled the coldness and indifference with which Xiao Chiye had abandoned him in the past. An endless disgust also rose within him. As if he was swatting away something terrifying, he said with all of his might, \u201cStrip him of his waist token first!\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cThis subject\u2013\u2013\u2013\u201dWei Huaixing straightened up and bellowed, \u201cIf he dares to disobey, we can detain him right here according to the laws!\u201dXiao Chiye stared at Wei Huaixing before he looked at Li Jianheng. He said in an aloof voice, \u201cIt is fine to detain me, Xiao Ce\u2019 an, but there must be an acceptable allegation.\u201dLi Jianheng felt that he had misplaced his trust. Caught in the crossfire taking place in the imperial court, he was already inclined to believe the others. And now, seeing the way Xiao Chiye was acting caused his fury to momentarily get the better of him. He reprimanded in a stern voice, \u201cKneel! I will take away your waist token today without fail!\u201dXiao Chiye had yet to move.But Li Jianheng could no longer contain his rage and barked, \u201cI command you to kneel!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 : Compound SearchThe imperial court was so solemn and quiet that one could even hear the drop of a pin.Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes gradually dimmed as he removed his own waist token.With his chest heaving violently, Li Jianheng announced, \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0Viceroy, Xiao Chiye, is suspended from duties and confined to his residence to await investigation! The internal and external patrols of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0shall now be taken over by the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0and the Eight Great Training Divisions.\u201dXi Hongxuan, who was among the crowd, looked stolidly through his\u00a0wusha\u00a0hat1\u00a0at Xiao Jiming, who had never once uttered a word. Xiao Jiming remained stable and still on his feet, unperturbed by what was happening.He sure is steady!Xi Hongxuan cursed inwardly.As expected, this Xiao Jiming was a tough nut to deal with. To think he could still maintain his composure on seeing Xiao Chiye in such a predicament. He was not in the least flustered; he did not even look like he had the intent to speak up.After\u00a0morning court\u00a0was dismissed, they gathered at Ouhua Pavillion.After taking his golden token and changing into an elegant pale-blue patterned robe with wide sleeves, Shen Zechuan let the courtesan lead him upstairs. Xi Hongxuan was lying on the\u00a0xumi\u00a0couch2\u00a0watching someone brew tea.On seeing him enter, Xi Hongxuan laughed out loud and said, \u201cLanzhou, that was such a delight today! Ever since the hunting ground incident, Xiao the Second has been one-upping me in every matter. This payback feels so gratifying!\u201dShen Zechuan took his seat and said, \u201cFu Linye was a good move. I never thought you could even take him under you.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think the Fu Clan was in the past? They were cow dung collectors outside Chuncheng\u2019s city gates. If not for our Old Master\u2019s appreciation of talent and assistance in helping them to break free of their original registration,3\u00a0 their Fu Clan would still be herding cattle today.\u201d Xi Hongxuan accepted the tea the maidservant presented to him and sampled a few mouthfuls before continuing, \u201cBut what a waste of the trap Elder Wei set. Xiao Jiming didn\u2019t take the bait.\u201d\u201cSuppressing\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0is already a challenge.\u201d Shen Zechuan tasted the tea and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid the loss will far outweigh the gain if you touch Xiao Jiming now.\u201d\u201cThe best policy is to follow up on our victory and press home the attack. If we don\u2019t fight now, then when are we going to wait for?\u201d Xi Hongxuan raised his hand to dismiss the maidservant. He straightened up in his seat. \u201cEven if we can only make Xiao Jiming suffer a small loss in\u00a0Qudu, it\u2019d still be a chink in their armor.\u201d\u201cI thought your intent was\u00a0Qudu. I didn\u2019t think you would already be thinking of eyeing the outskirts for a fight even before your foundation is stable.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cThe Eight Great Training Divisions have yet to get a firm grip on power. You\u2019ll most likely tumble and suffer a setback if you skip over\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0now.\u201dXi Hongxuan set aside the teacup and asked, \u201cThen, in your opinion, what else should we do?\u201d\u201cYou said it earlier.\u201d Shen Zechuan smiled. \u201cThe best policy is to follow up on victory and press home the attack.\u201dXi Hongxuan pondered it for a moment and said, \u201cOur move today has already caused Xiao the Second to lose the Emperor\u2019s confidence and trust in him. Even his waist token was removed, making it impermissible for him to move about before the start of spring. But he has been buddies with the Emperor for many years after all. It is impossible to take him down with just this incident alone.\u201d\u201cAs long as\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0is still the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0Viceroy, the authority over\u00a0Qudu\u00a0patrols will still fall back into his hands. Did you all go through so much trouble with me just to get temporary authority of the Eight Great Training Divisions to play around with for a month or two, before returning it to him with your thanks?\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cYou dealt\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0a blow this time. But once he bounces back after spring, how are you going to face his counterattack?\u201dXi Hongxuan spread his folding fan open and fanned himself with it a few times before saying, \u201cWhat else can we do? We definitely won\u2019t be able to knock him down now.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t. But you can wear him down.\u201d Shen Zechuan was not fond of drinking strong tea, so he did not touch it again after a taste. He said, \u201cHis Majesty is already suspicious of him, and his suspicion in the days to come will not be lower than this. This is the time for you to act.\u201d\u201cI have neither talent nor merit.\u201d Xi Hongxuan smiled and said, \u201cSo how can I be compared to him?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to be humble.\u201d Shen Zechuan tapped on the tabletop. \u201cThe tunes in this Ouhua Pavillion are unconventional and original. Even His Majesty, who is used to fooling around red-light districts, would find it a breath of fresh air. Second Young Master Xi, do you still feel that you can\u2019t be compared to\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0when it comes to playing?\u201d\u201cLeaving aside Secretariat Elder for now, even if I play, there\u2019s no way for me to play my way up to Xiao the Second\u2019s position.\u201d Xi Hongxuan said, \u201cYou must have a trick up your sleeve, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cAfter Xue Xiuzhuo entered the Court of Judicial Review, all he has been handling one after another are major cases. But he is, after all, just one man. When it comes to talent and fame, he is also outdone by Yao Wenyu, who roams free and unfettered over the lands. If he wants to go further now to prepare for his entry into the Grand Secretariat in advance, then he needs someone to exalt him.\u201d Shen Zechuan drew a small circle on the tabletop with his fingertip. \u201cYou stood in the limelight before the students of the Imperial College the last time and left behind a good name. Isn\u2019t this just perfect for you to do him, Xue Xiuzhuo, a favor? Lately, Secretariat Elder Hai has also been thinking of setting up an Imperial College. From here, Xue Xiuzhuo would be able to choose his soldiers and generals.\u201d\u201cExpand manpower to make waves.\u201d Xi Hongxuan turned it over in his mind and said, \u201cBut Yanqing has his own men. Why must he go to the Imperial College?\u201d\u201cTo deal with\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er, there is a need to bury the hatchet with the other clans and join forces to strike a blow at the enemy. But the Yao Clan isn\u2019t willing. Think about it. The position of the Yao Clan in the hearts of the literati is like a boulder. Never mind if they aren\u2019t willing to work with you. The fear is that they will turn around and act in cahoots with\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er. If that\u2019s the case, why not kick the Yao Clan out as early as possible and leave the position to someone competent enough to be up to the task?\u201dXi Hongxuan unexpectedly laughed and said, \u201cYou were born in Zhongbo, so you don\u2019t understand the origins of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans. Even if the Yao Clan isn\u2019t willing to join in, we absolutely cannot kick them out. Because there\u2019s no way to kick them out at all.\u201d\u201cThink back to the heyday of the Yao Clan and survey the Imperial Court. There was no place for the Xi Clan.\u201d Shen Zechuan took out his handkerchief to wipe the water droplets. \u201cI know about the noble clans\u2019 origin, but I\u2019m asking you to hold down the Yao Clan. The current situation can no longer allow for actions from another party. Second Young Master, he who hesitates is lost.\u201dXi Hongxuan did not dare to take the decision into his own hands. Thus he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this again. Let me think about it.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xiao Chiye was in the midst of sharpening his blade. He wiped down\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0carefully, leaving not a stain of dust on it.Zhao Hui handed Lu Guangbai a cup of tea and asked, \u201cIs the Second Young Master wiping the blade over and over again to hack someone?\u201dLu Guangbai laughed as he drank his tea. \u201cThe way he is today, venturing outdoors with his blade is going to be no piece of cake. Jiming, did you get a clear look? I thought this lad was going to cry when he removed his token earlier.\u201d\u201cIt was a rare sight.\u201d Xiao Jiming smiled too. \u201cTo think there\u2019d be a day where the brat can\u2019t vent his anger.\u201d\u201cWho are you disparaging?\u201d Xiao Chiye folded his handkerchief rather unhappily.\u201cWe\u2019re praising you.\u201d Lu Guangbai sighed and said, \u201cAs expected of someone who has stayed too long in\u00a0Qudu. What an act that was.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that all I\u2019ve learned here?\u201d Xiao Chiye sheathed his blade, then took his seat and propped up his legs. \u201cOld Wei was trying so hard that I really had to think a little more highly of him. Never mind if it was someone else, but why are all my\u00a0gege\u00a0happy to see me being pinned down and pummeled by others?\u201d\u201cThat was truly a rare sight,\u201d Zhao Hui sighed with emotion.\u201cI was even worried you\u2019d feel sad.\u201d Lu Guangbai said, \u201cOf all people to play with, you just had to play with the\u00a0Son of Heaven.\u201d\u201cHis Majesty ascended to the throne all of a sudden, and was attacked again and again. He isn\u2019t a bold man to begin with, so it\u2019s only to be expected for him to be afraid now.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cI just never expected Fu Linye to be cut from the same cloth as them.\u201d\u201cFu Linye has some connections with the Xi Clan. But he\u2019s still not that far gone to be the noble clans\u2019 lackey.\u201d Xiao Jiming said, \u201cHe\u2019s most likely thinking of seizing the opportunity to win His Majesty and Wei Huaixing\u2019s favor by impeaching you.\u201d\u201cYou pushed Wei Huaixing pretty hard too, to make him take out his last trump card.\u201d Lu Guangbai said, \u201cNow that he has taken it out, we can fight back.\u201d\u201cWei Huaixing has been around for so long, and yet he has never been able to enter the Grand Secretariat. This definitely has to do with this person\u2019s temperament.\u201d Xiao Chiye thought for a moment. \u201cAlthough Hua Siqian used him when he was still alive, he disdained him a lot. Now that Secretariat Elder Hai is fearful of the noble clans taking over the Grand Secretariat, he\u2019s also holding him back without letting him get promoted. He bears a grudge. If he wants to fight it out with Secretariat Elder Hai, then he has to join forces with Xi Hongxuan and storm through the enemy ranks for them. He wants to cross this threshold that has been holding him back for more than ten years. I only need to flinch back a little this time, and he would definitely keep up his pursuit and take out that last memorial.\u201d\u201cThis is a matter of utmost importance. Even if the evidence was forged, he would still do a pretty realistic job of it.\u201d Xiao Jiming said, \u201cHe started from the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s accounts, knowing that Hai Liangyi is so particularly nervous about the disbursement of military funds after the Hua Faction incident that he would not tolerate anything objectionable when it comes to this matter. The\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0will come to investigate you during these few days. They can\u2019t let Fu Linye investigate it alone. They will have to pick someone impartial from the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0or among officials with the authority to carry out audits to conduct the investigation together.\u201d\u201cMost likely, someone from the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0will coordinate with Fu Linye to investigate.\u201d Zhao Hui paused. \u201cAfter all, this is an assassination case.\u201d\u201cImperial Bodyguards.\u201d Lu Guangbai looked towards Xiao Chiye. \u201cWe are not only without a helper in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards; they are even full of our adversaries. A-Ye, you\u2019re going to take a beating for real this time.\u201dXiao Chiye gave a somewhat wicked laugh and said, \u201c\u2026\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, huh. I\u2019m on familiar terms with one.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8A few days later, the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0started their investigation of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s accounts. Before Fu Linye set off, he saw Shen Zechuan, who was coordinating with him to audit the accounts. Knowing that the other party was a favorite in the Emperor\u2019s employ recently, he did not dare to slight him and thus got someone to serve up excellent tea first.Shen Zechuan drank a few mouthfuls and said mildly, \u201cIt\u2019s my first time on the job, so I\u2019ll have to trouble Your Excellency Fu to guide me this trip.\u201dFu Linye regarded him as one of the noble clans, but he still had some fear of him in spite of the sense of closeness. Thus he merely said,\u201d I\u2019m not worthy enough to guide, so I\u2019ll have to trouble Your Excellency the Judge to make this trip with me. The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0is as impenetrable as a metal bucket. I\u2019m afraid there will be many accounts that are both authentic and doctored. When the time comes, I\u2019d like to ask of Your Excellency the Judge to do a thorough search.\u201dAs for who and where to search, Fu Linye spoke not a word about it. He did not want to throw in with the noble clans and offend Hai Liangyi, and he had no wish to throw in with Hai Liangyi and step on the noble clans\u2019 toes either. He was a fence-sitter who observed the direction of the wind and went whichever way the wind blew. But he knew that he had severely offended Xiao Chiye this time. They were bound to make things hard for him when he went to check the accounts. Who didn\u2019t know how much of a jerk Xiao the Second was? Searching his residence would only be adding fuel to the fire. So he was unwilling to steal all the limelight this time round. He shoved Shen Zechuan out and let Shen Zechuan conduct the search, all to let Shen Zechuan be the footsoldier.Shen Zechuan readily accepted it.On seeing this, Fu Linye\u2019s fear of him receded; instead, he saw him as a greenhorn.Everyone split up and went about their ways. Fu Linye headed for the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s office compound, while Shen Zechuan went to the Prince of Libei\u2019s residence.He was still far from arrival when Ding Tao, who was sprawled on the rooftop, saw him. He sighed and said, \u201cHow can he be like this?\u201dGu Jin asked, \u201cWhat do you mean by like this or like that?\u201dDing Tao hemmed and hawed.So Gu Jin said, \u201cYou are referring to how he\u2019s on good terms with Second Young Master and yet still helps others investigate Second Young Master\u2014like this?\u201dDing Tao interrupted. \u201cThey aren\u2019t on your average good term!\u201d\u201cSuch are men.\u201d Gu Jin twisted the wine bag open. \u201cYou will understand when you grow up. Everyone is like this. Hugging together is a domestic affair done inside the house, but everything else that happens once you put on your clothes and step out of the door are public affairs that stay out there. You cannot talk about them in the same breath\u2026 Don\u2019t jot this down!\u201dShen Zechuan came to the door, where Zhao Hui and Chen Yang greeted him. With Zhao Hui on military appointment, Shen Zechuan was instead the one who had to pay his obeisances to him.\u201cThe\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u2019s courtyard is in the north.\u201d Zhao Hui said to Shen Zechuan. \u201cIt mostly houses Libei\u2019s military affairs.\u201dShen Zechuan replied tactfully, \u201cThe purpose of this humble servant\u2019s trip here today is to investigate the Second Young Master. It has nothing to do with Libei.\u201dUnderstanding that he did not come here for the specific purpose of creating trouble, Zhao Hui nodded and signaled to Chen Yang with his eyes. Chen Yang stepped forth and said as he led the way, \u201cThe Second Young Master\u2019s courtyard is in the east. May I trouble Your Excellency the Judge and the various\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0brothers to follow me.\u201dShen Zechuan bowed to Zhao Hui and followed after Chen Yang.Xiao Chiye\u2019s courtyard was large. Going by structure size, it surpassed the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u2019s courtyard, but Xiao Fangxu was already too lazy to change it back then, and the brothers themselves did not mind, so all along, it had been Xiao Chiye who was staying here. After he took up office as the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s Viceroy, he hardly returned. Most of the time, he rested in that small residence near the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0office.When Shen Zechuan saw him, he was fishing by the pond with a woven raincoat draped over him.\u201cYour Excellency the Judge is so early.\u201d Xiao Chiye held the pole. \u201cHave you taken your breakfast?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve eaten back at the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cThe Viceroy sure has such refined taste for leisure.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just an idler placed on suspension. How can I be compared with Your Excellency the Judge?\u201d Xiao Chiye shook his pole. \u201cTo search my courtyard, you must show me the search warrant first.\u201d\u201cAll of us are old hands who often run assignments in\u00a0Qudu.\u201d Shen Zechuan said unhurriedly, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty silly for the Viceroy to obstruct me in a huff.\u201d\u201cLet me verify the document.\u201d Xiao Chiye stood up and tossed away the fishing pole. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t please me to let you enter my courtyard without showing the warrant.\u201dOn seeing the situation, the Censor from the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0who was tagging along hurriedly stepped forth to mediate and pacify both sides. \u201cEasy there. Easy does it. Viceroy, please wait a moment. Your Excellency the Judge, please don\u2019t take offense either.\u201d\u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0know better than anyone else when it comes to playing it by the book.\u201d Xiao Chiye moved closer and rebuked him coldly, \u201cHave you still not learned of this after all this time since your release from Zhao Zui temple?\u201dShen Zechuan looked at him and said, \u201cThe tiger that ends up on the flatlands would be insulted by dogs.4\u00a0Whether a wild dog like me gives you the document today or not, you\u2019d still have to welcome it all with a smile.\u201dWiping his sweat, the Censor squeezed his way between both men and cupped his hands repeatedly to plead with them. \u201cLet\u2019s just talk this over. It\u2019s all\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s quite the mouth you have there.\u201d Xiao Chiye pushed aside the Censor. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019d still dare to come to blows with me?\u201d\u201cNo blows. You mustn\u2019t fight!\u201d The Censor craned his neck to shout. \u201cWe have the search warrant. Please take a look, Viceroy. We have to search the compound too. Judge, please wait. Let\u2019s just talk this over. Easy there! Why y\u2019all gots to get so anxious fo\u2019?!\u201dIn his moment of anxiety, this Censor had even lapsed back into his local accent!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 : OffensiveThe accompanying Censor was called Yu Xiaozai, a low ranking Investigating Censor of the seventh grade. This position was the same as the Chief Supervising Secretary of the various offices. It was a low-ranking post, but came with great authority. He had the power to inspect and supervise, so it was the most appropriate for him to step forth and mediate between both men.It was the dead of winter at the moment, but Yu Xiaozai was so anxious that he was sweating buckets. Even though he often ventured out on field works and inspection rounds to run assignments, he had never been put in such a difficult position before. He could not afford to offend both sides! This was just great\u2014at his yells, both men who had been in a heated exchange were now looking at him.Yu Xiaozai earnestly did his best to persuade them. \u201cT\u2019is early still. I\u2019ll give over the search warrant in a while to the Viceroy to look over slowly. I have it with me.\u201dAs he spoke, he took out the document from his bosom and handed it to Xiao Chiye.Xiao Chiye flipped through it briefly and looked towards Chen Yang, who immediately said, \u201cThis way, Your Excellency the Judge.\u201dYu Xiaozai clasped his hands again and continued in his accent, \u201cT\u2019is how it should be done. Should always go by the book. All o\u2019 us are doing official business fo\u2019 His Majesty. Ain\u2019t no need fo\u2019 everyone to get all flustered.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s cold outside. Gu Jin, please invite this\u2026\u201d Xiao Chiye hesitantly came to a pause.Yu Xiaozai cleared his throat tactfully and resumed his official speech, \u201cThis humble official\u2019s surname is Yu. I\u2019m Yu Xiaozai. My humble courtesy name is Youjing. I thank the Viceroy in advance for your kindness, but I\u2019ll give the tea a miss. There\u2019s still official business to be done, so this humble official still has to follow after His Excellency the Judge.\u201dXiao Chiye did not continue to make things difficult for him and gave a slight nod of his head. Gu Jin stepped forward and bowed in respect to Yu Xiaozai, then led him to the courtyard.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan ascended the stone steps. Xiao Chiye\u2019s study was already open. Attendants, with all their heads bowed, stood on both sides.Chen Yang said, \u201cThis is the Viceroy\u2019s study. Your Excellency, please go ahead.\u201dShen Zechuan raised his hand, and Ge Qingqing turned to the side to nod to the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0behind him. Everyone then dispersed and began to look through the books on the open shelves.Chen Yang motioned to Ding Tao to keep watch here and continued to lead Shen Zechuan further. After turning around the veranda and passing through the gate, they arrived at Xiao Chiye\u2019s bedchamber.Chen Yang said, \u201cThis is the Viceroy\u2019s bedroom. There are many objects bestowed by the Emperor. Thus, I\u2019d like to ask of His Excellency the Judge to examine them personally.\u201dAfter thanking him for the trouble, Shen Zechuan strode in.Xiao Chiye\u2019s room was large, but it was surprisingly simple and tidy. A table with horse-hooves legs sat behind the screen, with a few military books set on top of it. There were no floral decorations or antique calligraphy and paintings, only a territory map of the Empire of Dazhou hanging horizontally on the wall.Shen Zechuan picked up the military book and opened it for a look. It was clean inside, as if no one had ever read it.After a while, the door closed.With his eyes never leaving the book, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cAccompanying Censor Yu will be coming here once he has finished checking the study.\u201dXiao Chiye undid his overcoat and said, \u201cJust checking the study alone will keep him occupied until noon. Fu Linye sure is something. To dodge me, he shoved you here.\u201dShen Zechuan gently flipped through the pages and said, \u201cHe just wants to complete the investigation quickly and close the case, all without offending anyone.\u201dXiao Chiye turned his head sideways and looked at Shen Zechuan\u2019s silhouette through the screen. He asked, \u201cWhy are you hiding in there?\u201dShen Zechuan replied, \u201cChecking the accounts.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cThe stuff you want to audit isn\u2019t there.\u201dShen Zechuan closed the book, put it back on the tabletop, and said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know until I\u2019m done checking.\u201dXiao Chiye raised a finger to tap on the screen. He said, \u201cWhy does it sound like you\u2019re checking something else?\u201d\u201cTreasonable texts, bribery ledgers, military correspondences.\u201d Shen Zechuan said to the screen, \u201cI have to check for them all.\u201d\u201cYou missed something out, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to check for lewd poems and erotic arts?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here on official business.\u201d Shen Zechuan said softly. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s broad daylight. I wouldn\u2019t dare to be impetuous.\u201dThe screen was translucent, so both men\u2019s figures were faintly visible. Xiao Chiye\u2019s fingers slid along the shadow to the position where Shen Zechuan\u2019s neck was. Although there was no physical contact, it still ignited a heat in Shen Zechuan, as if he was being caressed.\u201cXi Hongxuan has invited you for a drink.\u201d Xiao Chiye said with certainty.\u201cHm.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s response was nonchalant.The pulps of Xiao Chiye\u2019s finger slid to Shen Zechuan\u2019s collar. He asked, \u201cWas it good drinking with the courtesans?\u201dShen Zechuan replied unhurriedly, \u201cYes.\u201dXiao Chiye asked, \u201cDid you drink until you felt hot?\u201dShen Zechuan replied, \u201cI did.\u201dXiao Chiye was hot too. Three of his fingers slid down, seemingly along Shen Zechuan\u2019s neck, to pry apart the front flaps of his clothes before slipping further down. Instead of retreating, Shen Zechuan advanced and let Xiao Chiye\u2019s fingers slid across his chest through the mist-like ink painting screen.\u201cDo you wear earrings?\u201d Xiao Chiye suddenly asked.\u201cNope.\u201d Shen Zechuan tilted his head slightly to expose his ear. \u201cDo you want me to wear?\u201d\u201cSecond Young Master will make a little jasper earring and gift it to you to play with.\u201d Xiao Chiye said.\u201cOne?\u201d\u201cOne.\u201d With his eyes closely following Shen Zechuan\u2019s hazy neck and ear, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cWear it on the right ear.\u201dXiao Chiye was used to scoop him up with his right hand. He just had to lower his head slightly when he turned him over, and he would be able to take his earlobe into his mouth. Jasper set against satiny white. His dazed and satiated expression, as his sweat-drenched hair at his ears were brushed aside, would surely be a sight to behold.Shen Zechuan did not answer, but revealed a meaningful smile through the screen. Xiao Chiye could not see his eyes clearly, but he could see the corners of his lips; he was exuding that kind of subconscious invitation again.\u201cHug me.\u201d\u201cTouch me.\u201dXiao Chiye closed his eyes, feeling that Shen Zechuan always left room for more every time. These kind of voiceless lines seemed to urge his surging waves of desire to crash over him even more violently. He swore that he was not originally a man who could be this easily aroused. His desires initially lay in the blue dome of heaven and the grassy wildernesses.\u201cThe wine at Ouhua Pavillion is delicious, as is the wine at Xiangyun Villa.\u201d Shen Zechuan was unaware of the implications of his silence. \u201cBut you\u2019ve been hanging out in Xiangyun Villa for years. I supposed you didn\u2019t expect the courtesans of Xiangyun Villa to throw themselves into someone else\u2019s arms too.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s always a difference between the new lover and the old flames.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cIt\u2019s only natural for them to be jealous now that I\u2019m indulging myself in you.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know that Xiangyun Villa was under Xi Hongxuan\u2019s control either.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cWhat are you to do now that they are unanimously claiming that you took bribes? Are you going to get these old flames to amend their testimonies by melting them with tenderness?\u201dXiao Chiye retracted his hand and said, \u201cThe owner of Xiangyun Villa is not Xi Hongxuan. At least not while I was still hanging around there. Courtesan Xiangyun of Xiangyun Villa is resourceful. She has a reputation for being talented among the civil officials and even the students of the Imperial College. With that bit of learning Xi Hongxuan has, he would never be able to bring her under his control.\u201d\u201cYou mean?\u201d\u201cThere are only two possibilities that can make Xiangyun commit perjury. One is that she fell in love with some noble young master and was willing to stomp on me for the sake of the other party. The second is that she was coerced by someone and had no other choice but to submit fake testimony.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cIf it\u2019s the latter, we\u2019ll need to investigate it properly.\u201d\u201cSeems like your old flame still carries some weight in your heart.\u201d Shen Zechuan smiled and said.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cXiangyun was the one who leaked news of the surveillance deployment in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0every time. Now that she has abruptly switched allegiances\u2026 I can\u2019t bear to see her suffer too.\u201d\u201cWhat a considerate man.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cThe period after the new year is crucial. Whether or not you can turn the table around and make a comeback at the start of spring depends on how you take a beating now. So don\u2019t you lose your head and go around messing your plan up for the sake of a beauty.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m idling away at home at present. I can\u2019t get out, so I\u2019ll have to ask you to help me investigate.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cDuring your investigation, please pass a message to Xiangyun while you are at it. Tell her that the Second Young Master is still thinking of rekindling old flames with her.\u201dShen Zechuan pushed away the screen gently and said, \u201cI\u2019m busy with work these days. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have the time. Why not ask Ding Tao or Gu Jin to make a trip for you?\u201dFinally able to get a clear look at him, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cWhy? Don\u2019t you just happen to be residing on Donglong Street?\u201dShen Zechuan was about to answer when he suddenly heard the sounds of footsteps outside. Before he could move, Xiao Chiye suddenly bent over and hoisted him over his shoulder. In a few steps, he leaped over the long table and brought Shen Zechuan into the inner chamber.Yu Xiaozai lifted the hem of his robe and ascended the stairs. He knocked on the door and called out, \u201cYour Excellency the Judge?\u201dHis Excellency the Judge was pressed up so close against the wall behind the cloth racks that he could not answer. That civilian clothing was covering his body all over. Shen Zechuan backhandedly pressed his palm against Xiao Chiye\u2019s chest and turned his neck to the side, wanting to reply\u2014but Xiao Chiye suddenly held him high. Shen Zechuan bumped into the clothes rack. Seeing that the clothes rack was about to tilt over to the ground, he immediately raised his leg to stop it in its track. Xiao Chiye exploited the opening and lifted Shen Zechuan\u2019s other leg to his waist, thereby trapping the latter before him.\u201cHe has the authority to present the memorial directly to the Emperor for the Emperor\u2019s viewing.\u201d Xiao Chiye said slowly. \u201cIf he were to see you and me together, there\u2019ll be no way we can ever explain our way out of this.\u201dYu Xiaozai knocked on the door again and asked, \u201cIs Your Excellency the Judge here?\u201dShen Zechuan grabbed hold of Xiao Chiye\u2019s hand and said in a hushed tone, \u201cTaking advantage of someone in a predicament is not what a gentleman should do.\u201d\u201cMe? Taking advantage?\u201d With his hands cupping Shen Zechuan\u2019s buttocks, Xiao Chiye pressed his nose in and smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m taking advantage of you while you are in a predicament.\u201dShen Zechuan locked eyes with him, his chest heaving slightly.After quite a while of not getting a response, Yu Xiaozai pushed the door open. With the search warrant under his arm, Yu Xiaozai strode in and started to survey the room as he readied himself to search.Shen Zechuan slowly hooked his long leg back to return the clothes rack into place. His waist and buttocks had to move ever so slightly as he stretched out his leg. But now, they were being cupped in Xiao Chiye\u2019s palms. It was only after he broke out in a thin layer of sweat that he steadied the clothes racks.Once the clothes rack was stabilized, Xiao Chiye pressed in against his ear and whispered very softly, \u201cActually, it won\u2019t topple over.\u201dShen Zechuan looked at him out of the corners of his eyes and mouthed the words with a smile:\u00a0You\u2014Son\u2014Of\u2014A\u2014Bitch.Xiao Chiye readily accepted it and said into his ear, \u201cSo, wear an earring. Lanzhou.\u201dYu Xiaozai mumbled something to himself. After looking through the antechamber, he headed for the inner chamber.Shen Zechuan wanted to move, but Xiao Chiye persisted in pressing against him with the stance of one who would not step aside if he did not nod his head.\u201cWear it,\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s breaths moistened Shen Zechuan\u2019s ears. The heat was breathed so deep inside that Shen Zechuan\u2019s spine tingled with numbness. Xiao Chiye murmured with a smile, \u201cWear it for my eyes.\u201dWear it for my eyes.What an arrogant and presumptuous request it was. Xiao Chiye no longer avoided his wolfish nature. He pushed and pressed this fervent yet urgent desire towards Shen Zechuan, making sure that Shen Zechuan felt this scalding heat.The intercourse both men had that night when they plunged into the abyss was one of desperation and despair, where their bloody chests and abdomens clung inseparably close together as their vulnerabilities lay exposed before the other party\u2019s eyes. Xiao Chiye did not intend to relive it all alone after daybreak. He wanted to grab hold of Shen Zechuan by the ankle and haul him back little by little to confine him in the sea of desires where there were only the two of them riding its waves.Yu Xiaozai had already walked to the side of the hanging curtain. Shen Zechuan held on tightly to the fabric on Xiao Chiye\u2019s chest and, in this moment of emergency, looked face to face at him in close quarters.Yu Xiaozai lifted the curtain again and saw no one in the inner chamber. The clothes rack in the corner was cluttered with everyday clothes. It was inconvenient for him to rummage through them, so he could only use his eyes to size up the place.Shen Zechuan, who was lying under the bed, had difficulty breathing. There was no room under the bed for two people to lay over one another at all. The weight of Xiao Chiye\u2019s chest as the latter pressed down on him forced him to open his mouth to breathe slowly. This strong and well-built body was truly too heavy.Xiao Chiye lowered his head to stare at him.Shen Zechuan immediately sensed it and said soundlessly:\u00a0No way. Nope. No\u2014Xiao Chiye kissed him, robbing him of the chance to gasp for breath. Shen Zechuan tightened his grip on his back, gripping him so hard it hurt. But Xiao Chiye still lured him gradually into a state of suffocation. The sensation of being on the verge of fainting rendered Shen Zechuan incapable of warding off Xiao Chiye\u2019s offensive.It was like he was drowning in deep waters, and only Xiao Chiye was the driftwood that could save Shen Zechuan. Yet this driftwood was forcefully staking his claim on his territory like huge swells of raging waves battering away at him, wanting him to remember deeply his ruthlessness this very moment, along with the trepidation of being progressively invaded by him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 : Account LedgersWith impure intentions, Xiao Chiye raided and seized Shen Zechuan\u2019s lips and tongue, throwing Shen Zechuan\u2019s mind into chaos as he was kissed until he could not breathe for air. As the time ticked by, his tightly clenched fingers slowly lost their strength.Being unable to catch his breath caused Shen Zechuan to feel vaguely dizzy. In this murky gray narrowness, he fell prey to the net Xiao Chiye\u2019s set as a trap. He seemed to sink deeper into the water in which he was drowning as the sensation of suffocation intensified. Xiao Chiye kept him in captivity in his arms, holding in his struggles, thereby making himself the one and only person Shen Zechuan could rely on at this very moment.Yu Xiaozai moved to the side of the bed again, his shoes shuffling right beside both men.The sound of hurried footsteps suddenly rang out outside. Chen Yang said, \u201cSo Your Excellency the Censor is here! Please come with this humble servant. Your Excellency is needed to personally look through the documents found in the study.\u201dThus, Yu Xiaozai followed him out with the document under his arm. He asked, \u201cWhere is His Excellency the Judge?\u201dChen Yang did not dare to look around the room. He led Yu Xiaozai out and said as he shut the door, \u201cHis Excellency the Judge was drinking tea at the duty office room earlier. He should be on the way here right now.\u201dYu Xiaozai asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t His Excellency come over way earlier?\u201dChen Yang replied,\u201d It\u2019s so freezing cold. He will only feel refreshed and energized if he drinks a cup of tea to warm up\u2026\u201dThey moved farther away into the distance. Only then did Xiao Chiye leave Shen Zechuan\u2019s lips a little.Lying beneath him, Shen Zechuan recovered his breath. His almost blanked-out eyes were lowered. As he swallowed the saliva, his throat bobbed in tandem with the fall and rise of his chest. His lips had been kissed until they had gone bright red and moist. This bout of kiss near about ended him.Xiao Chiye was gasping for breath too.Shen Zechuan reached a hand out from under the bed. He made to get out and said, \u201cYou\u2014this\u2014\u201dXiao Chiye extended a hand to grab his outstretched wrist, pressed the tip of his nose against him, and kissed him once more.The last time, Shen Zechuan had said that Xiao Chiye was \u201cravenously gorging himself\u201d. The latter obviously bore a grudge with him for this. This time, Xiao Chiye \u201ctook his time savoring and devouring\u201d as he played around with the kiss, cutting off Shen Zechuan\u2019s voice that rang out intermittently and dissolving his words between their intermingling tongues before making him swallow them all back into his tummy.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8It was a little less than an hour later when Yu Xiaozai saw Shen Zechuan again. He stepped forth to pay his obeisances and turned pale with alarm. Deeply concerned, he asked, \u201cYour Excellency, this\u2026\u201d\u201cGot scalded.\u201d Shen Zechuan replied expressionlessly.The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0nearby were still flipping through that extensive library of books. Ge Qingqing came over and shook his head at Shen Zechuan.They were originally just here to go through the motions. Seeing that it was almost time, Shen Zechuan said to Yu Xiaozai, \u201cThe checks here are almost done, so why don\u2019t you and I head for the office compound first to report back to His Excellency Fu.\u201dYu Xiaozai concurred and surveyed the place again. He said, \u201cTo avoid suspicions, the Viceroy is still sitting outside. Before we leave, we have to notify him.\u201dShen Zechuan silently pressed the tip of his tongue against the corner of his lips and nodded his head in response.Sure enough, when they went out, Xiao Chiye was still sitting by the side of the pond1\u00a0fishing with the same woven raincoat draped over him. It was as if he had been sitting there all day and had gone nowhere else.\u201cIt\u2019s already late. Why don\u2019t both Excellencies have your meal first before you leave?\u201d Xiao Chiye was holding up the fishing rod with his legs propped up. Who knew if he had even caught a fish yet?Yu Xiaozai declined the offer and excused himself. \u201cHaving imposed on Your Excellency for the entire day, I wouldn\u2019t dare to tarry any longer. Next time, I\u2019ll play host and treat both Excellencies to a cup of wine.\u201d\u201cSure, if it\u2019s drinking.\u201d Xiao Chiye shook his rod and lifted a small silver crucian carp out of the water. He laughed out loud, tossed the fish into the basket, then set aside the rod, and carried the basket over. Bending over slightly to emerge out of the grove, he tossed the basket to Yu Xiaozai and said, \u201cI owe it to the consideration Your Excellency Yu has shown me today. These fishes are a small thank-you gift from me.\u201dSome snowy fog fell upon them. Yu Xiaozai was still looking at the fish basket with his head lowered; thus, he was not paying any attention to the two men.Shen Zechuan looked at Xiao Chiye, who casually rubbed his right ear with his thumb. Shen Zechuan promptly averted his eyes.Overwhelmed by the favor, Yu Xiaozai said in response, \u201cOh no, how can I\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Xiao Chiye patted Yu Xiaozai and said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0would even consider these few fishes a bribe?\u201dYu Xiaozai said hurriedly, \u201cIt\u2019s not that\u2026\u201d\u201cCome over often in the future.\u201d Xiao Chiye moved aside to make way. \u201cChen Yang, send them off.\u201dBeing inexplicably thanked threw Yu Xiaozai off. He was still unsure what to make of it when he stepped out of the door.Shen Zechuan was about to get into the carriage when he suddenly touched his right earlobe, feeling as though this spot had been rubbed rotten by that jerk. It was so scalding hot that it made him feel vexed.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Fu Linye was in the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s office compound, sitting in anticipation with his legs raised. Meng Rui attended to him at the side. Seeing him drink cup after cup of tea without even shifting his butt, Meng Rui knew that he would not leave unless he pried something out of them.Meng Rui was fed up deep down, but he did not dare to let it show even the slightest. He continued to serve him premium tea and said with a smile, \u201cYour Excellency the Censor-in-chief Fu has already looked through the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0accounts books. The various lords of the Ministry of Revenue have tallied them too. If Your Excellency has something else to check, please feel free to tell this humble servant.\u201dFu Linye said unperturbed, \u201cThings like account books have to be carefully audited again and again. There may well be an omission or mistake somewhere. It can\u2019t be rushed. Take another look.\u201dWei Huaixing said that Xiao Chiye\u2019s repairs of the compound and expansion of the military drill grounds in recent years could not be accounted for. But in truth, it was all detailed in the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s account books. Fu Linye knew that Xiao Chiye was not an easy one to investigate, but he still had to churn out some dirt from this clear water. Otherwise, he could not report favorably back to Wei Huaixing. Moreover, Li Jianheng was always shielding the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0in the past, so when it came to Xiao Chiye, everyone simply let him be and steered clear of him by default. But this time, Li Jianheng obviously spurned him. The way the wind was blowing now, it was time to make Xiao Chiye suffer a little.The officials from the Ministry of Revenue who had followed along noisily flicked the beads of the abacus. Lamps had been lit in the hall. Each of them dug into the account books with great focus, loathing their inability to tally each account seven or eight hundred times.When Shen Zechuan arrived, he even saw Tantai Hu in the corridor. He said nothing, while Qiao Tianya, who was in disguise as an Imperial Bodyguard, followed him from behind and stepped through the door together with him.The sound of the abacus beads being flicked in the hall rang out endlessly. Fu Linye set aside the teacup and rose to his feet to greet Shen Zechuan.Shen Zechuan exchanged greetings with him, after which both men took their seats together.Fu Linye asked, \u201cDid the compound search go smoothly?\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cXiao\u2019Er\u00a0delayed us for quite some time.\u201dFu Linye inwardly thought to himself,\u00a0I knew it,\u00a0and said with concern, \u201cDid he make a move? That hoodlum is the most overbearing ever. This trip has been hard on Your Excellency the Judge.\u201dShen Zechuan thought,\u00a0he did make a move, but it has nothing to do with you. He smiled as well and said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I can still endure this bit of hardship for His Majesty.\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0initially did not permit me to search his compound. Fortunately, His Excellency Yu was there too and tried his best to persuade him.\u201dAs if venting on Shen Zechuan\u2019s behalf, Fu Linye said hatefully, \u201cWe are acting on His Majesty\u2019s orders. By simply hindering us whenever he wishes to, Second Young Master Xiao not only belittles and disrespects us, but His Majesty too.\u201dShen Zechuan looked into the interior of the hall and said, \u201cYour Excellency, is the investigation here not done yet?\u201dFu Linye replied, \u201cIt\u2019s done. But it needs to be re-audited a few more times. As you know, account books are the easiest to fake.\u201dShen Zechuan could tell what he meant from those words. After a moment\u2019s pause, he said, \u201cYour Excellency is the chief official of the search this time, so I\u2019ll do as you say.\u201dFu Linye merely smiled and did not respond. He drank tea with Shen Zechuan until the third quarter of the hour of\u00a0zi,2\u00a0when the newly audited account books were presented before them.Fu Linye flipped through them and suddenly asked Meng Rui, \u201cAt the start of spring last year, a temple was constructed in the palace on imperial decree. The Ministry of Works entrusted the important task of transportation to the\u00a0Imperial Army. But then, the construction of the temple fell through. The Viceroy even blocked in the Ministry of Works to demand for money, is that right?\u201dMeng Rui replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right. The money was delayed for several months. It was all the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s hard-earned money. The Viceroy was anxious, so he personally went to ask for it.\u201dFu Linye closed the account books and said with a sneer, \u201cBack then, the state treasury\u2019s expenditure hadn\u2019t been accounted for yet. Even the\u00a0Directorate of Ceremonial\u00a0didn\u2019t dare to approve it arbitrarily. How did the Viceroy get the money?\u201dMeng Rui said, \u201cOur\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0didn\u2019t get the money. It was the Secretary for the Ministry of Revenue, Wang Xian, who made the decision to give a batch of silk from Quancheng to the\u00a0Imperial Army, and the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0traded them for money. This account was also recorded in the book, with its coming and going all clearly accounted for.\u201dFu Linye suddenly smacked the tabletop with a force so hard that the teapot clattered. If not for Qiao Tianya\u2019s sharp eyes and swift reaction in catching hold of it, the tea would have poured all over Shen Zechuan\u2019s legs. Shen Zechuan remained smiling in his seat as he waited for Fu Linye to continue.This was an account from the start of Spring. At that time, Shen Zechuan was still staying at Zhao Zui Temple, but he knew of this debt. The reason this debt could be eventually resolved was, in truth, not because of Wang Xian, but Xue Xiuzhuo. Xue Xiuzhuo, then the Chief Supervising Secretary of the Ministry of Revenue, was the one who stepped forth to mediate and settle the debt by offering Xiao Chiye those silk from Quancheng.Shen Zechuan tapped his fingers on his knee. He thought,This account is a loophole.Sure enough, Fu Linye put on a show of authority and questioned Meng Rui, \u201cThis account book indicates that a total of 660 silks were allocated to the\u00a0Imperial Army. You people recorded it as low-grade silk from Quancheng, but\u00a0Qudu\u00a0treasury records state that they were all top-grade silk from Quancheng! It\u2019s just a word difference between low-grade and top-grade, but the difference is 4,000 taels! I\u2019m asking you, where did these 4,000 plus taels go?\u201dMeng Rui\u2019s reaction was swift. He answered methodically, \u201cThose allocated to us were indeed low-grade silk from Quancheng. The stuff was dispatched by the Ministry of Revenue themselves, and the handwritten transfer order indicated them to be low-grade silk from Quancheng.\u201dFu Linye flung down the account book and said, \u201cOf course. Wang Xian, right? He has long been colluding with you people. He wrote low-grade silk from Quancheng on the handwritten transfer order, but the treasury records clearly state that it was top-grade silks from Quancheng that had been taken out. What benefits did Xiao Chiye give Wang Xian that would make Wang Xian forge such a fake order?!\u201dShocked, Meng Rui said, \u201cYou have no proof! Your Excellency Fu, just\u2014\u201d\u201cThe way I see it, the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0is a front for harvesting ill-gotten gains. Xiao Chiye has been making a fortune through you people. Anyone with eyes can see it for themselves how he has been fooling around on Donglong Street all these years eating, drinking, and making merry! He has Wang Xian working in cahoots with him prior, and Yuan Liu currying favor and offering him peaches after. All Xiao Chiye does with the backing His Majesty\u2019s favor accords him is to engage in shady deals to line his own pockets!\u201d Fu Linye laughed nastily. \u201cYour Excellency the Judge, see this? The number one rising star is the number one thieving traitor! Tonight, you and I shall do another in-depth investigation. There will surely be more of such rotten accounts!\u201dShen Zechuan looked at Fu Linye until Fu Linye felt apprehensive. Shen Zechuan said, \u201cThis matter has nothing to do with the assassination case, so it\u2019s not within the scope of my duty this time. I\u2019ll let Your Excellency decide.\u201dFu Linye had initially intended to drag Shen Zechuan down with him and make an accomplice out of him, but he wavered a little when he saw that Shen Zechuan did not fall for it. But this matter could be considered a big deal if he reported it to the top. He was not willing to lose the merit for this, and so he steeled himself, slapped the table, and said, \u201cRun another audit! Check all the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s account books over the years for hundreds and thousands of times!\u201dShen Zechuan suddenly smiled and averted his gaze as he sat on the chair and drank his tea. Although he was smiling on the surface, his heart was gradually sinking. If it were not for Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s involvement in this account, he might not even have noticed it. Most likely, Xiao Chiye himself had forgotten about it too.Could it be that Xue Xiuzhuo was already on guard against the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0from that time onwards?Shen Zechuan blew at the tea foam in silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 : Blowing the FireThe lights of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s office compound remained lit until dawn. The men from the Ministry of Revenue audited until their heads spun. At long last, they sorted out the problematic accounts and handed them over into Fu Linye\u2019s hands.Shen Zechuan reviewed them all. Fu Linye attached the memorial and submitted them together with the progress of the assassination case to Li Jianheng\u2019s desk.The Grand Secretariat then discussed this matter before the Emperor.Fu Linye said, \u201cYour Majesty, one can know the flavor of the entire pot by sampling a morsel.1\u00a0It can be seen from this case that Xiao Chiye has been taking bribes for a long time. The power and authority of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0has been in Xiao Chiye\u2019s control over these years. I\u2019m afraid there are still many more falsified accounts like this one. The state treasury is now hard-pressed for money to disburse, and the local tax arrears owed have been piling up one after another. Keeping this kind of people around is like putting a fire under a pile of firewood\u2014a danger whom I fear will jeopardize the state.\u201dKong Qiu had looked through the books too. But he said, \u201cThe assassination case is still pending. It\u2019s really not fitting to complicate matters at this time. In this subject\u2019s opinion, the investigation for the bribery case can be postponed. At present, we must focus on the assassination case.\u201d\u201cHow strange.\u201d Wei Huaixing scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s all related to him, Xiao Chiye. So why should we investigate the cases separately? We might as well pull out the radish along with the mud2\u00a0and make use of this opportunity to conclude the cases together!\u201dKong Qiu remained unwavered and said, \u201cThis case has already deviated from the main point. The way I see it, you people do not want to expose the mastermind behind the assassination, but to use this chance to root out dissidents!\u201dFu Linye immediately retorted, \u201cThe bribery case is the melon we followed the vines to dig out.3\u00a0Why is it that when Minister Kong investigates, he is investigating the case; but when we do it, we are attacking his faults? The duty of the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0is to supervise. Was it wrong of me to impeach him for taking bribes?!\u201dKong Qiu said, \u201cWang Xian has not yet been put on trial. If we can pass a judgement on the bribery case just based on your words alone, then what need is there for the Joint Trial by the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices\u00a0in the future? We might as well let Your Excellency Fu make the rulings alone! What the Ministry of Justice has to investigate now is to verify the confession statement presented by His Excellency Wei. By the end of the night, I have not even examined the witness testimony and you people are already so anxious to convict him. What\u2019s the hurry? Even if he was at fault that you want to sentence him, you still have to follow the rules and regulations! Otherwise, where does the law stand?!\u201dThe three men began to quarrel before the Emperor. Unable to get a word in, Li Jianheng could only look at Hai Liangyi. Hai Liangyi sat and listened with his head inclined. Once he finished listening to what everyone had to say, he gave a slight nod of his head.Li Jianheng hurriedly asked, \u201cWhat does the Secretariat Elder think?\u201d\u201cWhat did the Secretariat Elder think?\u201d Shen Zechuan fiddled with the copper coins. \u201cNaturally, he would dismiss the memorial for the bribery case. Hai Liangyi has been stringent for so long that everyone regards him as a straightforward minister who is his own man. But he\u2019s the first one who brought down Hua Siqian and supported Li Jianheng. It\u2019d be strange if he still can\u2019t tell something\u2019s up. Xi Hongxuan and the others want to use him as a shield to make their move this time. Little would they imagine that the Secretariat Elder has long been sitting on the fishing boat4\u00a0keeping a constant eye on the brewing storm.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve done well.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi sat at the other end of the small table. \u201cInstead of stopping Fu Linye, you let him make the decision. This credit is all his alone. He is bound to get anxious, and subsequently, he\u2019d be unwilling to wait for a good timing. He\u2019d want to present the memorial right at once in an attempt to earn praises. From that round of denouncement before the Emperor, Hai Liangyi would already have gotten an inkling of what\u2019s happening. By now, he must have already guessed who are the ones who want to take down Xiao Chiye.\u201d\u201cJust blowing the fire with the wind.5\u00a0This fire isn\u2019t raging hard enough.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cIt can\u2019t even burn Xiao Chiye, let alone Xiao Jiming. The Quancheng silk case, if they were to investigate it seriously, is a bookkeeping mess that everyone knows all too well. The important thing now is not to reverse the verdict and clear his name, but how to make His Majesty partial to him.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The reprimand from the suspension of the waist token may seem serious, but in truth, it\u2019s merely a superficial slap on the wrist. His Majesty definitely has yet to harbor the notion of stripping away Xiao Chiye\u2019s military power.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi grasped the chess piece and pondered over it for a while before he said, \u201cYou have to let him stay this way. Never let him entertain the intent to take down Xiao the Second. Otherwise, it will be a great disaster in the making even if this is a small victory.\u201dShen Zechuan pushed over the copper coins that had been neatly arranged and began to stack them up again, one at a time. Tirelessly enjoying himself, he said, \u201cHai Liangyi has control of the Grand Secretariat. Although he has placed men of noble birth like Xue Xiuzhuo and the others in important posts to use them, he has also set up an Imperial College and is promoting the minor officials from humble backgrounds. Teacher, he wants to take the progressive approach and confront the noble clans slowly. Just based on this alone, he cannot let\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0fall.\u201d\u201cThe Xiao Clan is keeping their composure because they understand these all too well. Xiao Jiming is simply sitting and watching without doing a thing because this battlefield is limited to\u00a0Qudu; it doesn\u2019t extend anywhere near Libei. That makes it easy to resolve, and Xiao the Second would have fewer issues from home to worry about.\u201d Grand Mentor Qi placed the chess piece down and continued, \u201cEveryone is now excitedly kicking a man when he\u2019s down. His Majesty is still angry and so thinks of Xiao the Second as a disloyal, unfilial, and unrighteous person. But once the fire is big enough, it will reverse.6\u00a0Then His Majesty ought to change the status quo and come to pity his buddy who is \u2018all by his lonesome self\u2019 instead.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Li Jianheng had not seen Mu Ru for a few days. After the assassination attempt, he had to sleep with his surroundings brilliantly lit. Not one of the eunuchs were allowed to step into the sleeping chamber, and those attending to him at present were all palace maidservants.It was snowing heavily again today. Hai Liangyi was sick, so he could not go near the Emperor. Li Jianheng got the Imperial Academy of Medicine to head to his residence to take a look at him and even bestowed upon him a good deal of tonics. He also assured him repeatedly that he would study hard as usual and not fall behind on his studies.Ming Li Hall had quietened down. Li Jianheng flipped through a few pages of the book before he felt his back aching. He got up to look out of the window and saw the snow flying all over the sky like cotton. Suddenly in the mood, he summoned the palace maidservants to dress him and drape his cloak over him so he could head out to appreciate the snow.Li Jianheng roamed the garden with his entourage. When he saw the ice frozen over the lake, he recalled the ice bed he used to play with in the palace.\u201cIt\u2019s just the time to play when winter water freezes into ice.\u201d Li Jianheng asked around him. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone bring this up to me this year?\u201dThe moment the words left his mouth, he remembered. Emperor Xiande had just passed this year, and it would not do for him to create a disturbance or cause trouble during the state mourning period. Else, the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0would scold him. Thinking about this dampened his mood again. No longer wanting to see the snow, he sent someone to call for Mu Ru.Mu Ru arrived wearing a cape with a hood. Her posture was graceful as she walked among the snow with someone supporting her. On seeing her through the window, Li Jianheng immediately stepped out of the door to meet her.\u201cMy darling.\u201d Li Jianheng said. \u201cThe view of you walking in the snow is truly a sight to behold! I have to get someone to draw it down so that I can hang it up in the palace to look at it every day.\u201dMu Ru lifted the hood of her cape and said with a smile, \u201cHow would that do?\u201d She took the food container from the maidservant\u2019s hands and said, \u201cThe weather is cold. I\u2019ve made soup for Liu-lang.\u201d7Li Jianheng\u2019s mood soared when he heard her calling him \u201cLiu-lang\u201d. He led her inside by the hand and dismissed the attendants, then took his seat at the dragon throne, which he used to handle governmental affairs.Mu Ru ladled out the soup for Li Jianheng, who groused, \u201cThe assassination attempt by the castrated traitor the last time scared me so much that I could hardly sleep well these days.\u201dMu Ru coaxed him, \u201cThere\u2019s only just the two of us here now. So why is Liu-lang using such a formal term8\u00a0again?\u201dLi Jianheng gave himself a light slap on his own mouth and said, \u201cThis husband of yours is so muddle-headed.\u201dMu Ru cupped his face in her hands and looked carefully for a moment before saying, \u201cYou do indeed look haggard. I\u2019ll keep you company tonight, alright?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the only one in the entire world who dotes on me\u2026 I originally treated Ce\u2019 an as a brother, but who knew that he would now be implicated in the assassination attempt?\u201d Li Jianheng let out a long sigh. \u201cJust stay with me.\u201dMu Ru said, \u201cHer Majesty is very concerned for Liu-lang too. She has been chanting the sutras and going on a vegetarian diet these few days, all to pray for a peaceful new year for Liu-lang.\u201dLi Jianheng caressed Mu Ru\u2019s hand and said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t close with the Imperial Mother in the past, and I saw her as the villain. Who knew she could still treat me so kindly today? I, I\u2026 alas. It\u2019s all the fault of that old dog, Hua Siqian!\u201d\u201cWho said it isn\u2019t?\u201d Mu Ru looked at him fondly. \u201cLiu-lang has suffered much all because of the trouble that Hua Siqian stirred up. Her Majesty admonished him every way she could back then, but in the end, she\u2019s still a woman whose words hold no weight against a man\u2019s. He brushed off her advice and even blamed her instead.\u201d\u201cThey say what you hear is just hearsay, only seeing is believing.\u201d Li Jianheng said regretfully. \u201cIf I could have gotten along with Imperial Mother earlier, there would not have been so many misunderstandings between us.\u201d\u201cThere was an opportunity in the past.\u201d Mu Ru seemed to hesitate. \u201cI heard that many years ago when Liu-lang was still an infant, Her Majesty was already raising the former Crown Prince. But seeing that Liu-lang had no one to rely on, she thought of taking Liu-lang back to her palace to raise as well. Emperor Guangcheng gave his agreement too.\u201dLi Jianheng had never heard of this and could not refrain from probing further, \u201cThen what happened later? Why didn\u2019t she take me back?\u201dMu Ru soothed him for a while before replying, \u201cLater on, the Prince of Libei, Xiao Fangxu, submitted a memorial saying that by adopting the former Crown Prince, Her Majesty had the heavy responsibility of nurturing the heir apparent to the Eastern Palace. The Crown Prince is all grown. Raising another prince might be just inviting internal strife.\u201dLi Jianheng said, \u201cLi\u2026 so it\u2019s the Prince of Libei!\u201dThe seeds of discord had already been sown between him and Xiao Chiye. All sorts of mixed feelings instantly welled up in him when he heard of this old matter and thought about how Xiao Chiye had never once mentioned it. He felt that Xiao Chiye was too unfathomably shrewd and had never really opened his heart to him as a friend.\u201cHe\u2019s so\u2026 When all is said and done,\u201d Li Jianheng said bitterly. \u201cHe\u2019s the same as everyone else who treats me as a stepping stone. How pitiable am I to be born a noble, yet not even have a buddy I can rely on!\u201dMu Ru hugged him and said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t biological brothers after all. Who can compare to the former Emperor when it comes to treating Liu-lang well?\u201d\u201cA pity\u2026 A pity the imperial heirs of our Li Clan are few and far between. There\u2019s only me left now.\u201d At this point, Li Jianheng suddenly asked Mu Ru, \u201cYour younger brother has been hiding at Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s residence ever since Pan Rugui was beheaded. Is he doing fine now?\u201dMu Ru replied, \u201cyes\u201d, then turned around and covered her face to sob.Li Jianheng hurriedly asked, \u201cMy dear Mu Ru, what\u2019s wrong? Why are you crying?\u201dAs Mu Ru wiped her tears with a handkerchief, she looked at him tearfully and said, \u201cHe\u2019s doing fine, but he\u2019s not by my side after all, and I can only see him once every few months. He isn\u2019t like any other brother who can still make meritorious contributions to serve the sovereign. All he can do now is to\u2026 wait upon others.\u201dLi Jianheng could not bear to see her cry the most. He immediately said, \u201cAll you had to do was to tell me earlier, and it\u2019d all be fine, wouldn\u2019t it? We are husband and wife of the same mind. I\u2019m willing to do anything for you! What\u2019s more, this is human nature. Don\u2019t cry. My heart is going to break from your tears. My dear Mu Ru. I\u2019ll get Xue Xiuzhuo to send him back tomorrow and put him on duty at my side, okay?\u201dWith tears in her eyes, Mu Ru said, \u201cHow could that do? How are you going to justify it to the Secretariat Elder? The others won\u2019t agree either. I can\u2019t bear to put you in a difficult spot.\u201dLi Jianheng held her in his arms and said, \u201cI\u2019m the Emperor. I have the final say when it comes to affairs in the palace! Besides, if we get him to change his name, who can really insist on digging up his past? Pan Rugui is already dead!\u201dMu Ru let him coax her for a while before she broke into a smile and said, \u201cFengquan would want to kowtow his thanks to you too.\u201dLi Jianheng said generously, \u201cWe are family. By all sentiment and logic, it\u2019s what I ought to do.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8A few days later, the assassination case was still under investigation. Yuan Liu was tortured, and his confession was overturned, yet he insisted that he had never sent golden peaches to Xiao Chiye and did not know a single thing about the shady deal with the Donglong broker. Several times under heavy torture, he thought of giving in and getting it done and over with. But the moment the thought crossed his mind, he would remember that his entire family\u2019s life was still in Xiao Chiye\u2019s hands.Yuan Liu had been with the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0for a long time. He knew Xiao Chiye was a different man when it came to treating outsiders versus insiders. The Second Young Master said he would take care of his son on his behalf, and that meant that he would truly look after his son for him. If he so much said a wrong word, his son would be a goner too.Yuan Liu was caught in the middle of this power struggle, unable to seek life or death. All he could hope was for the case to conclude as soon as possible so that he could be given a quick end.The opportunity to conclude the case soon came.The matter kept taking a turn for the worse. Memorials impeaching Xiao Chiye came thick and fast. Strangely enough, after Li Jianheng personally took up his brush to berate Xiao Chiye, the Secretary for the Ministry of Justice submitted a report before the Emperor and said that their investigation had led them to a person.This person\u2019s name was Yinzhu. He was a eunuch from the Imperial Bakery. According to his oral testimony, he had been distributing fortune candies to the various imperial concubines four hours before the Feast of A Hundred Officials was due to start when he saw someone rebuking Fuling at the side of Caiwei Palace.And Caiwei Palace just happened to be the place where Mu Ru resided.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 : Case Closed\u201cIt was a cold day that day, thick with dark clouds and strong wind. This slave was distributing fortune candies to the various imperial concubines. When I came out of Caiwei Palace, I happened to encounter Imperial Concubine Mu-niangniang\u00a0setting out, so I withdrew to the corner of the wall. It was then I heard someone in the midst of reprimanding another. I took a peek and saw the eunuch-in-charge of Caiwei Palace arguing with Aunt Fuling inside.\u201d\u201cWhy did you keep silent on this matter during the first trial?\u201dIt was quiet in the hall, except for the sound of record-taking. A few lamps had been lit. Kong Qiu, who had been investigating for several nights in a row, had already drunk many a pot of strong tea. Right this moment, both of his hands were clasped before him as he asked Yinzhu, who was kneeling in the hall.Yinzhu\u2019s mouth opened and closed. \u201cTo reply Your Excellency, this slave thought this was a trivial matter. And because of the strong wind that day, I really didn\u2019t hear what they were arguing about. So I was afraid I would give the wrong answer.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then why did you suddenly confess?\u201d Fu Linye questioned.Yinzhu wrung the corner of his clothes and gulped down his saliva in panic and trepidation. It took him quite some effort before he replied in a small voice, \u201cI was scared to death by the beatings of the prison guard grandpa\u2026 Ever since I was thrown into the prison, I\u2019ve been listening to the sound of whipping every night. This slave\u2019s godfather was beaten half to death until he confessed everything regardless of importance. This slave is truly afraid now\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are in the solemn place of interrogation. How dare you ramble on and on?!\u201d Fu Linye rebuked in a stern voice.Yinzhu was so frightened by him that he trembled and stammered while kneeling on the ground, \u201cThis slave\u2026 had no idea that she would commit such a despicable act!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easy for one to be beaten into a confession under heavy torture. This person\u2019s words cannot be trusted.\u201d Fu Linye said to Kong Qiu. \u201cHow can such a confession be submitted before the Emperor?\u201d\u201cThe detailed discussions of the third trial are all recorded in writing. Whether it\u2019s true or not, His Majesty will naturally make a ruling himself.\u201d Kong Qiu said. \u201cOnce the statement has been transcribed and copied, the Secretariat Elder will require a copy on their end too.\u201dFu Linye had never expected a Cheng Yaojin1\u00a0to come charging out of nowhere when the case had already progressed to this stage. He could stomp on Xiao the Second because he was certain that Xiao the Second could not retaliate this time. A Yuan Liu whose name could not be clear meant that he, Xiao the Second, would not have a clean name too. Who knew that Caiwei Palace would be dragged in as well? This was just great. Everyone was tainted. Could they even continue to investigate this case in-depth?Fu Linye could immediately tell that this Yinzhu was not a simple man. He waited until the third trial before he was willing to voice this out. Most likely, someone had planted him here to wait!Fu Linye was burning with anxiety. He was different from Wei Huaixing, who had the Wei Clan behind him, while the Wei Clan had ties to the other clans. Even if Wei Huaixing could not explain himself, he would only end up with a punishment based on the outcome of the investigation. But what about him? He had no influential clan to fall back on!Seeing his expression undergoing several changes, Kong Qiu said, \u201cCaiwei Palace is the imperial harem after all. It\u2019s not appropriate for us external ministers to investigate, so we still have to discuss this matter before the Emperor. Your Excellency Fu, go back and get some rest. We\u2019ll meet again before the Emperor.\u201dFu Linye rose to his feet. Even though he was anxious, he could still plaster a smile on his face as he cupped his hands in respect to Kong Qiu and retreated in a hurry.At this moment, the sky was still dark and bitterly cold. Fu Linye urged the groom on. The horse carriage crushed noisily over the snow as it rushed towards Ouhua Pavilion. Lifting the hem of his robe, he stepped down and hurried on upstairs.Xi Hongxuan, who was versed in opera tunes, was presently discussing his new work with Shen Zechuan. Shen Zechuan was tired of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019 robe, so he was wearing a wide-sleeved garment as he leaned against the chair and listened, all the while opening and closing the folding fan in his hand.Fu Linye was not expecting Shen Zechuan\u2019s presence when he barged in.Shen Zechuan closed his fan gently and turned a blind eye to Fu Linye\u2019s sorry sight. Without rising to greet him, he merely said with a smile, \u201cYour Excellency the Censor has come a little too late. You\u2019ve missed the wonderful timing.\u201dXi Hongxuan was a little displeased. He waved away the procuress who had hurried over and had her close the door. He did not get up either, and simply let Fu Linye take a seat on his own and said, \u201cLinye, why have you come here? You should have sent someone over in advance to give notice! It\u2019s just a few steps away. Did you have to hurry over like this and disgrace yourself so?\u201dNot only was Fu Linye older than Xi Hongxuan, his grade was also higher than Xi Hongxuan. Yet he was now being chastised by Xi Hongxuan like a junior being berated. This made him unhappy. He loathed the way Xi Hongxuan was acting all high and mighty.\u201cIt\u2019s extremely urgent!\u201d It was as if Fu Linye did not hear the rebuke. He smiled as he lifted his robe to take his seat. He said, \u201cI rushed here as soon as I left the Ministry of Justice. So you tell me if it\u2019s urgent or not.\u201dOnly then did Xi Hongxuan ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dFu Linye looked at Shen Zechuan.Shen Zechuan lifted his fan and said, \u201cIt is I who have been rude.\u201dWith that, he was about to get up.Xi Hongxuan hurriedly said, \u201cLanzhou, what are you doing? Sit down. We are in the same boat, weathering through thick and thin. What is there that you can\u2019t listen to? Linye, go ahead and tell me! Don\u2019t you recognize this Shen Lanzhou? He\u2019s the great teacher of our Xi Clan!\u201dFu Linye initially only saw Shen Zechuan as a lackey who toiled for the Xi Clan in an attempt to survive. Who knew that Xi Hongxuan would value him this much?But tonight, Fu Linye had indeed come at the wrong time. If he had been a little earlier, or a little later, Xi Hongxuan would not have spoken so highly of Shen Zechuan. But they had only just finalized the follow-up plan to suppress the Yao Clan, closing the loop tight around the latter\u2019s neck. Xi Hongxuan just happened to be thinking of showing Shen Zechuan some due respect. Now that he had elevated him, he would no longer be able to call him his buddy as he wished in the future.Shen Zechuan smiled and looked at Fu Linye. Knowing what was expected of him, Fu Linye immediately said tactfully, \u201cYour Excellency the Judge, please take a seat.\u201dXi Hongxuan shifted his legs to step on the tiger skin and said, \u201cGo on. What\u2019s the urgency?\u201dFu Linye said, \u201cI was on jury duty earlier at the Ministry of Justice and heard the news that Fuling, who had instigated Guisheng into carrying out the assassination, was involved with Caiwei Palace. Second Young Master, the one living in Caiwei Palace in Imperial Concubine Mu-niangniang. This matter is going to be presented to the Emperor tomorrow morning. When the time comes, it won\u2019t be a matter of investigating just Xiao the Second!\u201dXi Hongxuan placed his hand on his leg for support. After a moment of silence, he said to Shen Zechuan, \u201cYou don\u2019t know it\u2014I forgot to mention it to you earlier, but our man is connected to Mu Ru.\u201dMost likely, Xi Hongxuan did not forget to mention it, but did not want to mention it. All this while, he had been on guard and that he had never uttered a word.Shen Zechuan knew this all too well and merely said, \u201cIsn\u2019t Mu Ru originally Pan Rugui\u2019s woman? I remember her younger brother.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Xi Hongxuan was unwilling to speak the truth and merely told half of the story. \u201cPan Rugui is dead. She has nowhere to go, doesn\u2019t she? At that time, when his residence was searched and raided, they wanted to release her from Pan Rugui\u2019s residence and had her fill in as an official courtesan.2\u00a0But His Majesty could not bear to let her be one, so he asked me to help. I made use of that bit of friendship I had with Yanqing and had her swapped out. Then I found a residence for the two siblings to hide in. Later, His Majesty could endure it no longer and insisted on getting her into the palace. Secretariat Elder Hai even made a scene over it. You know about this too.\u201dShen Zechuan did not really seem to care. He nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of it. This doesn\u2019t bode well then. This case should have concluded already. Why did complications arise again?\u201dHe looked at Fu Linye when he said this. Although he said it with a smile, it sounded a little like he was blaming Fu Linye for not keeping a close watch.Xi Hongxuan was frowning too. He said, \u201cYou are on the jury to supervise. Can\u2019t you just think of a way to suppress this matter? It will only stir up trouble if it gets presented to the Emperor.\u201dFu Linye had plenty of complaints too, but he could only say, \u201cSecond Young Master, my words carry little weight. We\u2019re talking about Kong Qiu here! He\u2019s a stubborn man who doesn\u2019t listen to advice. He\u2019s Secretariat Elder Hai\u2019s man. How would he listen to me? What\u2019s of top priority now is to decide what to do next. If Imperial Concubine Mu-niangniang\u00a0is involved too, then who would still dare to continue investigating? I\u2019m afraid even His Majesty himself would not be willing to!\u201dXi Hongxuan pondered over it in irritation, then asked, \u201cWhere is that Yinzhu?\u201dFu Linye instantly understood his intention and hurriedly waved his hands and said, \u201cWe can\u2019t kill him! Second Young Master, Secretariat Elder Hai is already on the alert now. If we silence him at this critical juncture, then it\u2019d only prove to him that there\u2019s something questionable about us!\u201d\u201cIt was originally going well. How did a Caiwei Palace suddenly pop up out of the blue?!\u201d Xi Hongxuan covered up his teacup with the lid and said, \u201cNo. We can\u2019t continue to investigate this case any further. Before the Emperor tomorrow morning, we have to think of a way to make His Majesty sever the notion of a further investigation.\u201dMu Ru was still of great use. They must let no one else take her down right at this moment.Fu Linye fidgeted in his seat and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019d be best to pin it all on Fuling! Conclude this case as fast as possible, and everyone can heave a sigh of relief. But from the way Kong Qiu looks to me, he clearly wants to get to the bottom of the matter!\u201d\u201cThe crux still lies with Secretariat Elder Hai.\u201d Shen Zechuan pressed his fingers against the teacup for warmth. \u201cHai Liangyi was the one who reviewed Kong Qiu\u2019s papers during the imperial examination back then, so Kong Qiu could be partially considered a student of Hai Liangyi whom Hai Liangyi selected for promotion. He usually has the most respect for Hai Liangyi.\u201d\u201cHai Liangyi wants to send him into the Grand Secretariat. He handles all his cases beautifully. He\u2019s of the right age too, and he comes from a humble family in the Chijun Commandery. He hits all the right notes with Hai Liangyi.\u201d Xi Hongxuan said, \u201cWhat fucking bad luck! We set up Xiao the Second, and all of them secretly enjoyed the show as they waited to see Xiao the Second suffer in silence. Now that something has happened, they all want to feign ignorance after having benefited from it.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cYour Excellency Fu, when the confession is presented before the Emperor tomorrow morning, don\u2019t mention Caiwei Palace. Just say the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s name is not clear yet. Yuan Liu has not admitted his guilt yet, right? This is an opportunity. As long as Yuan Liu is still around, then he,\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er, has accepted bribes. He won\u2019t be able to clear himself of suspicions.\u201dFu Linye rubbed his leg and said, \u201cBut even if I don\u2019t mention it, Kong Qiu will still bring it up! We won\u2019t be able to hide it.\u201d\u201cMending the fold even after the sheep is lost.\u201d Shen Zechuan nudged the fan open bit by bit, then closed it again and said, \u201cEarlier, Your Excellency\u2019s speech before the Emperor was a righteous one said \u2018for the sake of the empire and state\u2019. If you were to change your statement because of a confession that has yet to be verified, then I\u2019m afraid His Majesty will come to question your loyalty too. So why not latch on to\u00a0Xiao\u2019Er\u00a0and put on an \u2018upright\u2019 appearance instead?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Xi Hongxuan said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be thrown into confusion now. Since you have already stepped forth to make your stand, it wouldn\u2019t look pretty if you were to pull out now. Let\u2019s just continue with this. As for the rest, I\u2019ll naturally have my own way. It\u2019s almost dawn. You mustn\u2019t stay for long. Head back first for a bath and a change of clothes. Just watch the way the wind blows when you are before the Emperor and improvise as the situation calls for.\u201dFu Linye came in a hurry, then left again in a hurry without even taking a sip of tea. As soon as he left, Xi Hongxuan spat behind his back.\u201cIf he hadn\u2019t been so eager for quick success and instant gains and reported Xiao the Second\u2019s Quancheng silk matter to the top without saying a word that day, Hai Liangyi might not have noticed it.\u201d Xi Hongxuan felt fed up and continued, \u201cThose who come from poor and humble households are the most short-sighted! For that bit of glory, he didn\u2019t even dare to give us prior notice. See what happens now? What a waste of the chess piece Yanqing left us! After this, Xiao the Second will keep a tight guard over the account books. It\u2019ll be difficult to get at them later.\u201d\u201cPosition and wealth are ailments of the rich.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cAt present, we need to keep him from interfering in our plans. How is it going with the Eight Great Training Divisions\u2019 matter?\u201d\u201cHan Cheng\u2019s younger brother took over the post.\u201d Xi Hongxuan said, \u201cXiao the Second has set up the Eight Great Training Divisions into a heavily fortified network of relationships. We won\u2019t be able to lay our hands on it easily. To think he managed to hold all the important posts firmly in his hand in such a short period of time. It\u2019s not going to be easy to dismantle it.\u201d\u201cEven so, there are also descendants of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0among the soldiers he selected for appointment.\u201d Shen Zechuan smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll still get your chance.\u201dWhen Shen Zechuan emerged and got into the carriage, he saw a\u00a0guqin3\u00a0placed within.Qiao Tianya lifted the curtain. In disguise with the face of a burly chap, he said, \u201cThat\u00a0qin\u00a0is mine. Master mustn\u2019t throw it away. It took me quite a lot of effort to swindle it away.\u201d\u201cIt looks valuable.\u201d Shen Zechuan did not touch it. \u201cWhere did you get the money?\u201dQiao Tianya laughed merrily. \u201cA reward from the ladies.\u201dBut this\u00a0qin\u00a0was obviously something that money could not buy. Qiao Tianya had no wish to speak of it because it most likely had something to do with his family. So Shen Zechuan did not probe further.As usual, the horse carriage sent Shen Zechuan home to tidy up. After changing his robes, he entered the palace.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Li Jianheng dismissed the\u00a0morning court\u00a0and told every important official to take a seat in Mingli Hall. He himself read the entire confession statement and stayed silent for a long time.Hai Liangyi had only just recovered from his illness, so Li Jianheng got someone to serve him a bowl of warm goat\u2019s milk. He took a few sips. No one in the hall said a word.Li Jianheng said, \u201cWhy are we back to Caiwei Palace again? Yuan Liu hasn\u2019t been fully investigated yet.\u201dKong Qiu answered, \u201cThis matter concerns the imperial harem, so His Majesty should be the one to make a ruling.\u201dLi Jianheng immediately got anxious and said, \u201cWhat ruling? Even if she went to Caiwei Palace, it can\u2019t\u2026 have anything to do with Imperial Concubine Mu. Who knows if what he says is true or false?\u201dHai Liangyi said in a steady voice, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s false.\u201d\u201cRight, it\u2019s false!\u201d With Hai Liangyi as his backing, Li Jianheng\u2019s voice grew louder and clearer. \u201cThe eunuchs are the most treacherous. To survive, what kind of lies can they not fabricate? He thought he could save his own life by getting close to Concubine Mu; I\u2019m going to make that absurd and befuddled head of his roll!\u201d\u201cEven so,\u201d Xiao Jiming, who had not uttered a word regarding this case, raised his eyes. \u201cThis concerns the safety of the\u00a0Son of Heaven. We can\u2019t be slipshod when it comes to certain matters.\u201dHe hit the nail on the head as soon as he spoke.Wei Huaixing said, \u201cOf course we can\u2019t muddle through this. We have not investigated Yuan Liu yet, have we \u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe lead investigator of this case is the Minister of Justice. The Left and Right Censor-in-Chiefs of the Court of Judicial Review, as well as the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, are on the jury. Your Excellency Wei has repeatedly intervened. This is inappropriate.\u201d Xiao Jiming said with poise and courtesy, even giving Wei Huaixing time to speak. But Wei Huaixing did not dare to continue. And so Xiao Jiming kept going. \u201cThis case concerns the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0and the imperial harem; a scene should not have been made right out in the open. It\u2019s not the reputation of everyone here that is at stake, but the dignity of His Majesty. More than ten days have passed since this case occurred. There is still no proof for one Judge of the\u00a0Imperial Army, and no clarity on one confession statement from the brothel. Everything has been delayed in the hands of the Investigating Censor of the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau. From what I can see, neither the lead investigator nor the jury has done their jobs. Let\u2019s leave aside the wasting of time and energy for now; it\u2019s the overstepping of authority that is the real problem.\u201dFu Linye thought of the words Xi Hongxuan had said last night. He found himself in a difficult position again when faced up against Xiao Jiming. But when he saw that Li Jianheng had not said a word, and that Hai Liangyi did not seem to have the intention to help him out of the fix, he could only brace himself to keep his composure. He said, \u201cThe\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0has lived in Libei for too long;\u00a0Qudu\u00a0is not the frontiers, after all. There are many matters that are settled differently based on the difference in relevancy, so naturally \u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAny abuse of power within the military all falls under the charge of insubordination. Under the military law, the offender would be executed.\u201d Zhao Hui, who held an official appointment in the military, stepped out and continued, \u201cThe\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0should not be the one to speak on this matter, but it has been so long, and not even one of you has thought to remind His Majesty. Even Their Excellencies Censors-in-Chiefs seem to be in dreamland the way they handled this case in such a muddled way! The token of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0Viceroy has been suspended for over ten days. The Censor has already conducted a search thrice. And what has the investigation thrown up? Ought we not to be given an explanation?\u201dFu Linye said, \u201cDidn\u2019t we find out about the matter of the Quancheng silk?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being asked about the assassination case right now!\u201d Li Jianheng threw aside the confession statement. \u201cWhy are you dredging up this irrelevant case?\u201dFu Linye answered hastily, \u201cXiao Chiye is the root of all problems. He can\u2019t clear his involvement in the other cases too. Your Majesty, the assassination case must be investigated. But the bribery case must be diligently followed through as well.\u201d\u201cWhat bribe did he take?!\u201d Li Jianheng stood up and pointed at Fu Linye, \u201cQuancheng silk! Quancheng silk! Did you think I didn\u2019t know of this matter? I was still hanging out with him on the streets back then! I know about this more than you do! The assassin had already killed his way right before me. Yet you aren\u2019t anxious, and you are still fixated on this minor issue. Looks like the safety of the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u00a0is of no importance to you!\u201dFu Linye did not expect Li Jianheng to turn around and rebuke himself after fastidiously deliberating over his words to reproach Xiao Chiye a few days back, so he could not help but kneel in fear and said, \u201cYour Majesty! Your Majesty is this subject\u2019s sovereign. It\u2019d devastate me even if a strand of your hair was harmed. Your Majesty!\u201d\u201cEverything has its own priority in terms of importance and urgency. For this assassination case, Minister Kong had not slept for several nights in a row.\u201d Xiao Jiming said, \u201cCe\u2019an had handed over his waist token too. To avoid a conflict of interest, he doesn\u2019t even dare to ask about the progress of the case and has been reflecting on his faults the whole day at home. It would be better to clarify everything all at once now\u2014the current progress of the case, the stage the investigation is at, and the future course of investigation. This way, my residence can be better prepared for it.\u201dThe Vice Minister of Rites, Jiang Xu, stepped out and said, \u201cThe case is clear as day and involves the\u00a0Imperial Army. It does not concern the Prince of Libei\u2019s residence. Who went and conducted a search there? This is against decorum. Should the news spread, everyone will think that it\u2019s His Majesty who is investigating the Prince of Libei, and the friendly relations between\u00a0Qudu\u00a0and the frontiers will be impacted.\u201dLi Jianheng knew of the search at the prince\u2019s residence, but he had to feign ignorance. Dumb as he was, he still understood that Xiao Jiming had been observing everything that had happened these few days. There would be trouble if they kept on holding Xiao Chiye responsible.Li Jianheng immediately kicked Fu Linye a few times with his foot and scolded him, \u201cHow dare you! Who allowed you to investigate the Prince of Libei\u2019s residence? My order was for you to investigate the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s office compound!\u201dEnduring the kicks, Fu Linye hurriedly said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t this, this subject who investigated! Judge Shen was the one who went!\u201dShen Zechuan was momentarily stunned before he said, perplexed, \u201cI received the imperial edict to assist Your Excellency in the investigation. It was Your Excellency who exhorted me, saying that \u2018the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0is as impenetrable as a metal bucket. I\u2019m afraid there will be many accounts that are both authentic and doctored. When the time comes, Do a thorough search when you\u2019re at the prince\u2019s residence\u2019, and so I went. At that time, there were many people who were serving tea and water at the hall. Just call in one of them for questioning, and they can all tell you that it was Your Excellency who told me that.\u201dFu Linye said through clenched teeth, \u201cI only told you to do a thorough search. I did not mention the words prince\u2019s residence!\u201dShen Zechuan said with a severe countenance, \u201cI take orders from the\u00a0Son of Heaven. I would never speak a word of falsehood before the Emperor. If I did not have Your Excellency\u2019s order and went alone to the prince\u2019s residence, then how could there have been an accompanying censor with me?\u201dFu Linye saw the malice in Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes and knew that he had incriminated the wrong person in his moment of haste. He looked around and said, \u201cYour Excellency Wei, didn\u2019t Your Excellency Wei\u2014\u201dWei Huaixing instantly yelled to cut him off, \u201cShut up! How dare you implicate others before His Majesty for what you\u2019ve done of your own accord! Do you have no shame? Delaying the case is minor; but ruining the good will between His Majesty and Libei is of grave concern! You really have no sense for the gravity of matters!\u201dAt this point, Fu Linye already knew that he had been kicked forth to be the scapegoat. He had to take the blame for Li Jianheng, for Wei Huaixing, for Xi Hongxuan and company! And these were all people he could not afford to offend. When the higher-ups were in-fighting, it was up to him to clean up the mess.Fu Linye immediately kowtowed and said, \u201cThis subject had a momentary lapse of judgment!\u201d\u201cAnd yet you still dare to make excuses!\u2019\u201d Li Jianheng pointed at him and admonished, \u201cCe\u2019an\u2019s waist token may have been suspended. But before the case is concluded, he is still the Viceroy of the\u00a0Imperial Army! Investigate as you will; but how dare you also have an attitude towards the\u00a0Imperial Army! Seems to me that you aren\u2019t investigating the case at all. You are clearly trying to eliminate the dissidents!\u201dLi Jianheng had not lost his temper ever since he denounced Xiao Chiye that day, and now he was chiding Fu Linye until the latter trembled from head to toe. Fu Linye was sensible too, and knew to shed tears as he kneeled, completely restoring all dignity to Xiao Jiming.Xiao Jiming waited until Li Jianheng rebuked to his heart\u2019s content before saying, \u201cHis Excellency is just eager to investigate the case. Since the case has caused a commotion to such extent, why not dismiss Ce\u2019an from his post? The\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u2019s impeachment memorials these days make reasonable sense, if you ask me, Ce\u2019an cannot be excused for his negligence. He is indeed ill-suited to carry on his duties before His Majesty.\u201dWith that, he smiled again.\u201cAll the testimonies are pointing the finger at him. If he really did this kind of disgraceful, treacherous deed, then all nine generations in his clan should be executed. With everyone present here today, then to avoid conflicts of interests and to clear myself of suspicions, strip me of my Libei military forces waist token too. I have already sent a letter to Libei to ask Father to remove his crown and robe, and enter\u00a0Qudu\u00a0with my wife and son as commoners without rank4\u00a0to stand trial!\u201dAt the drop of Xiao Jiming\u2019s words, Li Jianheng panicked. It would not do for him to respond or remain silent on the matter, so he could only look toward Hai Liangyi.Hai Liangyi held gazes with Xiao Jiming for some time. The older man suddenly laughed and said, \u201cThe\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0jests. Isn\u2019t this case already closed? So why tease this old subject again?\u201dKong Qiu composed himself and swiftly followed up, \u201cThat\u2019s right, the Secretariat Elder is right. Although Yuan Liu has bought a house on credit from the Donglong broker, that is, after all, a private affair between him and Fuling. It isn\u2019t meant to be made public. The Viceroy oversees twenty thousand men; how would it be possible for him to investigate every single matter personally? As for the bribery case, Yuan Liu had been denying all this while, so we cannot only listen to Xiang Yun\u2019s one-sided statement. This subject has already ascertained that Xiang Yun most likely bore hatred out of love towards the Viceroy, so her excuse doesn\u2019t stand!\u201dLi Jianheng personally stepped forward and said, \u201cSince the case is closed, then there is no need to mention it again!\u00a0Hereditary Prince, please rise quickly!\u201dLi Jianheng did not want to investigate further either. The involvement of Caiwei Palace meant that it would involve Mu Ru too. Fu Linye was already a pawn to be disposed of at one\u2019s convenience. To these people, Mu Ru was an even lesser being. If there were really something between her and these cases, then he, Li Jianheng, would really be all alone by himself\u00a05\u00a0from then on.Li Jianheng watched these people, who were still talking and laughing as usual, but he felt as though they were not human. What stood behind them were monstrosities that far surpassed that of the throne, like the unstoppable floods and hurricanes.Being a sovereign did not mean that he was free and unstrained. Every single move of his could have repercussions on the situation. Those that he raged against and delighted in could all become vulnerabilities that proved fatal to him. He was no longer his own master. He was a prisoner chained to the dragon throne.How terrifying.Li Jianheng hugged himself somewhere deep in his heart.It was as if he was standing on thin ice when he stood beside these people. If he were to accidentally fall someday, then he would end up like his Imperial Elder Brother. In the blink of an eye, he would be trampled into a bloody pulp by the contending hooves of the various parties in the tussle for power.His life and death were not in the least bit important. What\u2019s important was merely the fact that he was the only one whose surname happened to be Li.But, what if there was someone else in this world with the surname Li?Li Jianheng trembled at the thought and instantly broke out in cold sweat.Impossible.He gloomily muttered to himself.There won\u2019t be.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 : Heavy SnowThe snow fell for several days. With the assassination case hastily concluded, the turbulent waves of earlier were swiftly buried under the snowstorm, turning into nothing more than a vast expanse of white. It was at this moment that Li Jianheng heard that Xiao Chiye had fallen ill.He had reportedly caught a cold, and yet he still faced the wall in self-reflection until he eventually collapsed onto the couch, apparently too ill to even get up. Li Jianheng braved the snow and set out on a carriage with his retinue to the Prince of Libei\u2019s residence. He led the various ministers, and once again, became good buddies with Xiao Chiye.All the others had left the room. Xiao Chiye\u2019s complexion was pale as he let Chen Yang help him up to sit face-to-face with Li Jianheng.Li Jianheng said, \u201cI feel very ashamed for rebuking you that day after believing those slanders.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cThe ruler and his ministers are interdependent on one another. That\u2019s the way it should be. Your Majesty needs not take it to heart.\u201dLi Jianheng fell silent, as did Xiao Chiye. In the end, they had both come to the point of addressing themselves as ruler and minister in private.Li Jianheng forced a laugh and said, \u201cI used to think that you were made of iron and wouldn\u2019t get sick. I didn\u2019t expect you to be no different from the common man when you fall ill.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cThis subject is merely an ordinary man with a body made of flesh and blood. I\u2019d still bleed if I were to get stabbed.\u201dLi Jianheng recalled the night at the hunting grounds where Xiao Chiye had spurred his horse into the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0all alone as the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0outflanked them. He had barely come out of it alive, and subsequently, he had put him on to the dragon throne.Humans were truly strange. When they abhorred a person, they would only remember all that was bad about said person. But once guilt came calling, they would only remember his goodness. It was as if they had taken to heart those words they had used to cuss the other party with others, thereby feeling more and more ashamed.There were plenty of things Li Jianheng wanted to ask Xiao Chiye. But at this moment, he did not feel like asking anymore. Xiao Chiye said that a body of flesh and blood would bleed. Then, what about the friendship that had grown apart?So Li Jianheng said, \u201c\u2026 Sitting in this position is not a choice I\u2026 I1\u00a0willingly make. Ce\u2019 an, you\u2019ve never sat here, so you won\u2019t understand how it feels like to be in a precarious position. The others all think that sitting in this position will make them happy and carefree. In the past, I used to think so too. But this isn\u2019t the case at all.\u201dXiao Chiye said nothing.Li Jianheng\u2019s eyes suddenly reddened. He did not know what made him sad either, so he could only say, \u201cI was originally a hopeless case. I\u2019m telling you; I\u2019m very much aware of it. If my brothers hadn\u2019t died, this position would not fall into my hands. But what have I done wrong? I have always wanted to be an idle prince. You people shove me up here without even asking\u2026 I have done my best, Ce\u2019an. I have really done my best. I\u2019m not capable enough to control this power of the world; I can only let it control me!\u201dLi Jianheng covered his face in agony and started to choke with sobs.\u201cCe\u2019an, it\u2019s too high sitting up here that I can\u2019t even get a clear look at anything!\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s eyes reddened too. He said, \u201cWe are brothers. Why would I blame you?\u201dLi Jianheng forcefully wiped away his tears and said, \u201cBut when all is said and done, I have marred our brotherhood.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cWhy blame yourself for something you have no choice over? I\u2019m the one who has been too ostentatious in the way I do things. I deserve to be put in my place by someone else.\u201dLi Jianheng said, \u201cSuch is your temper. You can\u2019t be faulted for this. They are only egging me on like this for their own sake. I\u2019ve let you down, Ce\u2019an.\u201dThey both seemed to have buried the hatchet and returned to the time they were each other\u2019s confidants. But the usual lightheartedness of clowning and jesting around had eventually given way to an awkward atmosphere that was more deference and less closeness.Li Jianheng did not stay long and left after he was done saying his piece. But before he left, he showered Xiao Chiye with lots of rewards and urged him to rest well.As soon as the people cleared out, Xiao Chiye tossed away the pillow supporting his back. Rising to his feet, he draped on his clothes and put on his shoes before heading for Xiao Jiming\u2019s study.Xiao Jiming was in the study listening to Zhao Hui speaking on military affairs. When he saw Xiao Chiye coming in, he waved his hand at him and motioned for him to sit before him.Zhao Hui did not stop and continued to say, \u201cThe Ministry of Revenue has already investigated the expenditure of military funds before the new year. The Grand Secretariat is still in discussion regarding the sum after the new year. The snow is heavy this year, and the people of Juexi are happy because the timely snow is an auspicious omen for a prosperous year, and they can look forward to a bumper harvest this year. But in Zhongdu, people are already starting to freeze to death.\u201d\u201cIn recent years, the prefectural\u00a0yamen\u00a0in Zhongbo has been short of manpower. With this heavy snow, there are few people who will be able to go and repair the collapsed abodes.\u201d Xiao Jiming drank his hot tea and thought for a moment. \u201cTell the Ministry of Revenue to set aside 40,000 silver from Libei\u2019s military funds at the start of the year to be used as repair funds for Cizhou of Zhongbo.\u201dCizhou was right next to the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path. This favor Xiao Jiming did could be said to be the rendering of timely assistance, much like sending charcoal in snowy weather.2Understanding his intent, Zhao Hui lifted his brush to record it in the book.\u201cThe prefectural\u00a0yamen\u00a0of Zhongbo lacks manpower, and there aren\u2019t many officials in the capital who are willing to go over. But it\u2019s indeed not a long-term solution to leave it hanging like this.\u201d Xiao Chiye poured tea for Xiao Jiming.\u201cHua Siqian was unwilling to take charge of this in the past. This is a hot potato. Taking it means having to fork out your own money.\u201d Xiao Jiming moved his fingers along the teacup and said, \u201cBut now, Secretariat Hai is in charge. This year\u2019s spring examination3\u00a0should be to seek a suitable candidate for Zhongbo.\u201d\u201cMost of the new officials are inexperienced and have no prestige to speak of. They can be low-ranking officials, but they won\u2019t be able to secure their positions if they are to be high-ranking officials of the border-provinces.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cThe one going to Zhongbo to run the show still has to be selected from the central administration.\u201d\u201cThere is a shortage of talents who can assume responsibility and are up to the task nowadays.\u201d Xiao Jiming said, \u201cZhongbo used to be a vassal state in the past. Thanks to the Shen Clan, there were many deep-rooted and complicated collusions taking place under the table and plenty of matters that couldn\u2019t be explained or accounted for. When Shen Wei was still around, it was already a set stage. Five years ago, it was abruptly thrown into anarchy and is now a land of chaos. At that time, the common folks fled away from it because of the Biansha\u2019s massacres of the cities. The imperial court was tardy in coming out with a pacification policy. Those who are still in Zhongbo are mostly the remaining military households from the garrison army and the roving bandits. As they say, barren hills and untamed rivers4\u00a0will produce undesirable citizens, and the current situation in Zhongbo is nothing but such. If the typical official were to go, he won\u2019t be able to hold the fort. On the contrary, he will be shown who\u2019s the boss.\u201d\u201cIf the imperial court is willing to send a military general with an army, they will still be able to take charge of the matter on the pretext of suppressing the bandits.\u201d Zhao Hui closed the book neatly. \u201cBut looking at the situation, I suppose they won\u2019t dare to do it.\u201dOf course, they would not dare to. At present,\u00a0Qudu\u00a0already had the Libei\u2019s Armored Cavalry to the northeast and the Qidong Garrison Troops to the southeast. These were both frontier lands with massive military forces. Holding them in check was already a strain. Taking the risk to send one out again would make it even harder to deal with once conferment was bestowed. But it would not do to leave things as it was in Zhongbo, either. This issue had to be resolved through a compromise.\u201cThis is a headache for the Grand Secretariat to deal with.\u201d Xiao Jiming pushed aside the military affairs and looked at Xiao Chiye. \u201cHow did it go?\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s elbows were propped against the armrests of the chair. He wanted to prop up his legs too, but he could not find a spot to. So he said, \u201cYou gave His Majesty such a scare. He\u2019s so frightened that he still wants to continue being buddies with me even if it doesn\u2019t please him to.\u201d\u201cBoth of you are dining and drinking buddies5\u00a0 to begin with.\u201d Xiao Jiming smiled. \u201cLet him fear. It\u2019s better than him not being afraid.\u201d\u201cFu Linye has made a great effort.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cI\u2019ll have to find a chance to thank him sometime.\u201d\u201cYou might as well thank the friend who has been helping you in secret.\u201d Xiao Jiming said. \u201cSomeone on the inside has put in quite the effort for this case to conclude so smoothly. Given Fu Linye\u2019s experience, he shouldn\u2019t have been so careless as to fall for the trap this easily.\u201d\u201cUh-huh\u2026\u201d Xiao Chiye merely smiled and changed the subject. \u201cWhere\u2019s Gu Jin? Call him in. I have orders for him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019d be better to call all of them in. I have orders too.\u201d Xiao Jiming turned his head to Zhao Hui and motioned to him.Zhao Hui headed out to call them over, and Meng flew in immediately right after. It landed on the clothes rack, and the snow it shook off wetted the clothes that had been hung up to dry. Ding Tao took off his shoes before hopping in and rushing over to stand as straight as a ramrod before Xiao Jiming. Behind him, Chen Yang and Gu Jin entered.\u201cHereditary Prince!\u201d The person Ding Tao held in esteem the most was Xiao Jiming. Revealing his snowy white teeth, he said, \u201cHereditary Prince, please go ahead and give your command! I, Ding Tao, will not hesitate to brave fire and water for you!\u201d\u201cYo.\u201d Xiao Chiye lifted the teacup and said, \u201cWhy have you never said that to this Second Young Master?\u201dDing Tao said, \u201cYou\u2019re always throwing me out.\u201d\u201cWhat wrong have you done to make the Second Young Master throw you out?\u201d Xiao Jiming asked in a mild tone.Ding Tao immediately replied, \u201cI haven\u2019t. It\u2019s just that the Second Young Master is always getting me to keep an eye on that\u2014\u201dXiao Chiye almost spewed out his tea. He closed the lid with a \u201cclatter\u201d and signaled to Chen Yang with his eyes. Chen Yang promptly rapped Ding Tao on the head. Ding Tao, still not knowing what was happening, covered his head and did not dare to say a word more.Xiao Chiye\u2019s tongue was hurting from being scalded. He said, \u201cDrag him out and bury him on the spot! What\u2019s with that complaint? Let Gu Jin explain!\u201dDing Tao said in aggrievement, \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201dChen Yang covered his mouth and dragged him out. After opening the door, he really buried him in the snow.Gu Jin thought to himself,\u00a0what do I say? What the hell can I say?Standing before Xiao Jiming, he saw that Xiao Jiming was about to put down the teacup, so he immediately kneeled on one knee and respectfully took the teacup before setting it on the table. He said clumsily, \u201cHereditary Prince, it\u2019s hot!\u201dXiao Jiming was not in a hurry to ask on seeing this. He looked at each of them in turn until Xiao Chiye felt uncomfortable, as if he was sitting on pins and needles.Xiao Jiming asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Is the Second Young Master hiding someone in the residence?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cHow is that possible?\u00a0Dage, I have not even proposed marriage yet. There\u2019s no reason for me to tarnish a maiden\u2019s reputation.\u201dXiao Jiming looked at him for a long while. Xiao Chiye did not know if Xiao Jiming had believed him, but Xiao Jiming dismissed the topic and told him to continue.Xiao Chiye found a comfortable position and said, \u201cI\u2019m thinking of asking Gu Jin to do a check on Xiangyun Villa.\u201dZhao Hui pondered and said, \u201cXiangyun Villa is on Donglong Street. It\u2019s a mixed bag of crooks and honest folks to begin with. It\u2019ll not be easy to investigate in secret. Does the Second Young Master think there\u2019s something fishy about Xiangyun?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s definitely something fishy about her.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cWei Huaixing has her testimony in hand. Why would she offend me for no good cause?\u201dZhao Hui said to Xiao Jiming, \u201cHereditary Prince, I heard someone said it was hatred borne out of love.\u201dXiao Jiming said to Xiao Chiye at his own pace, \u201cSince she has become an old flame, then you must have a new lover now. It\u2019s been a few days since I entered the capital; why haven\u2019t I heard you mention it?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cI\u2019m just bored with fooling around. There\u2019s nothing else to it.\u201d\u201cWhy blink your eyes when you are talking?\u201d Xiao Jiming said. \u201cBlinking means you\u2019re lying. Which clan is this maiden from? This matter has been on Father\u2019s and your sister-in-law\u2019s minds. If there\u2019s indeed something this time, then what\u2019s so hard about telling me? We\u2019ll handle it for you immediately.\u201d\u201cThere isn\u2019t one.\u201d Xiao Chiye could not sit still any longer. He wanted to run, but he did not dare to. So he could only say, \u201cThere isn\u2019t one. Really. What am I getting married for? Isn\u2019t that just going to hold up her future?\u201d\u201cOnce you get married, you\u2019ll mature a little.\u201d Xiao Jiming wanted to pat his head, but he could not do it before his subordinates and diminish his dignity and authority. Thus, he lowered his voice, \u201cHow long can your sister-in-law and I keep you company? In this\u00a0Qudu, there has to be someone who can hold a lantern or light a lamp for you and chat with you. No matter who catches your eyes, Father and I will do our best. As long as you like her, we can settle it for you even if she\u2019s a lady of a noble clan.\u201dXiao Chiye originally thought of bantering his way through it. But on hearing this, he suddenly felt touched and said, \u201cCommander-in-chief Qi\u2026 You can do it even if it\u2019s someone like Commander-in-chief Qi?\u201dThe expression in Xiao Jiming\u2019s eyes underwent a slight change. He did not expect Xiao Chiye to like someone like the Commander-in-chief. After a moment\u2019s pause, he said with complicated feelings, \u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll consent to it if she hasn\u2019t hacked you to death by then.\u201dAt night, when Xiao Chiye got on the bed, he suddenly stepped on an object. He bent over to pick it up from the woolen rug. It was a pearl that was used as a button.Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes followed the pearl to the base of the bed.\u201cChen Yang.\u201d Xiao Chiye suddenly opened the window and shouted.Chen Yang walked over from the foot of the stairs. Xiao Chiye thought for a moment while looking at him before saying, \u201cMake a trip to the jewelry shop on Shenwu Street tomorrow morning.\u201dBefore Chen Yang could reply, Xiao Chiye raised his hand and tossed a box to him.\u201cTell them to make these into earrings. Make one of all the designs available.\u201d Xiao Chiye thought long and hard before continuing. \u201cKeep it simple. Nothing too fancy.\u201dChen Yang looked at the box and asked, \u201c\u2026 All?\u201d\u201cAll.\u201d Xiao Chiye closed the windows. After a moment of silence, he opened them again.Chen Yang did not dare to move. He held the box with both hands and called out in bewilderment, \u201cMaster?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cPut it on the account!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 : Romantic LiaisonsYuan Liu died a sudden death in prison, and Chen Yang was the one who went to collect his body and bury him. As per Xiao Chiye\u2019s wish, he settled Yuan Liu\u2019s wife and son down in a new house in the City of Dancheng and hired a decent teacher for Yuan Liu\u2019s son.Xiao Chiye\u2019s illness lasted until the snow in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0melted. By the time he could step out to attend court sessions, Xi Hongxuan had already been promoted to the Secretary of the Bureau of Evaluations.Shen Zechuan returned the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s waist token to Xiao Chiye. In the time Xiao Chiye took the token, he eyed Shen Zechuan all over thoroughly.\u201cThanks.\u201d Xiao Chiye extracted the waist token from Shen Zechuan\u2019s hand. \u201cYour Excellency the Judge.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not deserving of it.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s fingers curled slightly, as if he could not bear to let go.Xiao Chiye swung the waist token and said, \u201cGot attached to it?\u201dShen Zechuan laughed and said, \u201cYeah. Got used to feeling it these days.\u201dXiao Chiye saw that the people around them had all retreated far away from them, so he said, \u201cIt\u2019s too pathetic to just feel my waist token alone.\u201dShen Zechuan clasped his hands behind him and said to him, \u201cYou\u2019ve just recovered from a major illness. Second Young Master, you can dally all you want, but you have to know when to stop.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been pure of heart and free of desires for more than half a month.\u201d Xiao Chiye felt sleepy as he basked in the sunlight. He shuffled his feet. \u201cThe heartless cad I\u2019ve been yearning for day and night did not even visit me once. Now that I\u2019m out, I have to find a way to heal my broken heart.\u201dShen Zechuan bathed in the breeze and said, \u201cIt\u2019s better to forget that kind of bad egg who often ditches the old for the new and has countless new and old flames before it\u2019s too late. Wasting the prime of one\u2019s youth for him is so not worth it.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cBad what?\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cSecond Young Master.\u201dXiao Chiye wanted to squeeze his nape. But it was inappropriate to stand here and squeeze him, so he said, \u201cWell said. It\u2019s so well-worded that this Second Young Master wants to applaud.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d Shen Zechuan said modestly. \u201cIt\u2019s all good as long as you feel my sincerity.\u201d\u201cSo, I see you\u2019ve made a point of checking out who some of those old flames are.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cYou\u2019re that bothered, huh.\u201d\u201cCheck, I didn\u2019t.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cI can pry out all sorts of love affairs just by sitting and drinking wine in Xiangyun Villa. For example, how the Second Young Master is a regular patron and an old hand when it comes to romantic liaisons.\u201d\u201cAdmirable, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Xiao Chiye asked.\u201cIndeed, indeed.\u201d Shen Zechuan looked at him as he spoke and slowed down. \u201cBut hearsay cannot be compared to personal experience. The legendary man himself doesn\u2019t seem to be the same person as the one I\u2019ve encountered.\u201d\u201cTo be fair, you didn\u2019t get that many opportunities.\u201d Xiao Chiye raised his fingers to hang up the waist token. \u201cYou will understand it better once you\u2019ve played with me a few more times. It\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t tried \u2018taking the time to savor and devour\u2019. How was the taste of it?\u201dShen Zechuan pursed his lips tightly under Xiao Chiye\u2019s gaze.Xiao Chiye smiled and said, \u201cLooks like you still remember it. Then, do you still remember what you have promised me?\u201d\u201cTo pass Xiangyun a message on your behalf.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cPlaying the matchmaker for the two of you and earning myself a cup of wine to drink at your wedding feast. Of course, I remember.\u201d\u201cI knew you were reliable.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cHow should I thank you if this matter succeeds?\u201d\u201cJust treat it as gift money for your wedding.\u201d Shen Zechuan said absent-mindedly as he lazily looked out along the stone slabs.Han Cheng just happened to exit the hall. He waved his hand at both of them as the little eunuch beside him came running over.\u201cThis way, my lords. His Majesty is waiting!\u201dLi Jianheng sat on the dragon throne and listened as the others discussed official matters. It was soon to be the beginning of spring,1\u00a0a time when the planting and cultivating of mulberry and flaxseed were major issues. Cen Yu, the Left Censor-in-chief of the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau, submitted a memorial and mentioned that there were signs of public ditches in the various residential areas in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0being illegally occupied. At present, the snow was starting to melt. If they could not keep the clogged ditches unobstructed, then the streets would be flooded once the rainy season hit.This was such a minor issue, at least compared to what was being discussed, that it seemed insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Li Jianheng did not even hear him clearly before letting the matter drop as the loud voice of the Provincial Administration Commissioner from Zhongbo drew away his attention.Several times, Cen Yu tried to speak again but was interrupted.When Cen Yu left the palace after court was dismissed, he suddenly heard someone calling him from behind. He looked back and saw that it was Shen Zechuan.Shen Zechuan paid his obeisances and said, \u201cAs presumptuous as it is of me to stop Censor-in-chief Cen, this humble official has an issue to seek your advice on.\u201dCen Yu said, \u201cJudge Shen, please speak.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cI heard the Censor-in-chief mentioned the clogged public ditches in your memorial during the court session earlier. Are you referring to the unexpected upsurge of ditch water in the residential area on Donglong Street?\u201dCen Yu motioned for Shen Zechuan to talk as they walked. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Donglong Street\u2019s illegal claiming of the public ditches has been ongoing since the reign of Xiande. At the start of spring in previous years, it would flood the residential areas. But since it has not resulted in any deaths or accidents, no one really gives it that much thought.\u201dShen Zechuan promptly gave a faint, bitter smile and said. \u201cTo tell Your Excellency the truth, this humble official is currently living there.\u201dStartled, Cen Yu hurriedly asked, \u201cHas it already been flooded these days?\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cThe place this humble official lives in is on higher grounds. In my immediate neighbors\u2019 attempt to lay claim on the public ditch and expand their courtyards, the eaves of their residences are already pressing up against mine. Owing to the obstructed flow of passage, sewage water had already begun to inundate my courtyard. Before this morning\u2019s court session, this humble official made a trip to the surrounding residential area. The low-lying civilians\u2019 houses are already all underwater.\u201dCen Yu said worriedly, \u201cIt\u2019d be bad if we were to encounter an epidemic. Let\u2019s leave aside the matter of the flooding for now. Because everyone wants to snatch those few inches of land, their houses are all built close to one another with no bricks and stones in between; it\u2019s all wooden planks. It is a major accident waiting to happen if a fire were to start.\u201dShen Zechuan thought about it and comforted him, \u201cYour Excellency, don\u2019t worry. This humble official will speak to His Excellency the Commander-in-chief to see if he can report to the Emperor and send men to clear out the ditches before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll also talk to the Secretariat Elder again.\u201d Cen Yu lifted his foot to leave, then turned his head back and said to Shen Zechuan with a smile, \u201cI appreciate the Judge\u2019s thoughtfulness. If we can resolve this matter as soon as possible, then it\u2019d count as one merit.\u201dShen Zechuan cupped his hands in respect to him and saw him off.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8The red plum blossoms in the residence had withered. When Shen Zechuan arrived, Xiao Chiye was standing in his study, looking at the remnants of those plum blossoms.\u201cIt\u2019s so terribly damp everywhere with the snow melting these few days.\u201d Xiao Chiye plucked a plum blossom branch. \u201cThat house of yours is not inhabitable now, is it?\u201dShen Zechuan had indeed been fretting about this matter recently. He gently pulled at his collar and said as he changed his shoes, \u201cThe courtyard is already flooded.\u201d\u201cWhen I passed by that place five years ago, Zhao Hui mentioned the issue about the public ditches.\u201d Xiao Chiye turned back. \u201cIt has been so long. To think no one has gone to fix the problem.\u201d\u201cAnyway, those who soak until they rot in there are all lowly lowlifes. What\u2019s more, it takes time and effort to fix the issue.\u201d Shen Zechuan said with a mocking expression. \u201cWho will be willing to do it?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to do it?\u201d Xiao Chiye looked at him and walked over. \u201cThis year is the first year of Tianchen. There will be a merit and achievement appraisal by the\u00a0Censorate. If something were to happen, the entire imperial court of civil and military officials will fight over themselves to do it.\u201d\u201cDoubt it.\u201d Shen Zechuan supported himself against the wall and was about to step onto the mat when Xiao Chiye blocked his way. He raised his eyes and said, \u201cHm?\u201dXiao Chiye bent down to pick up Shen Zechuan\u2019s boots. He pressed a few times on the leather and said, \u201cIs the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0so stingy that they can\u2019t even give you a pair of deerskin boots?\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s socks were half wet, so Xiao Chiye asked the servants to fire up the charcoal basin to heat the room. Shen Zechuan did not look too good today, and it turned out that he was freezing.\u201cDeerskin boots won\u2019t be able to withstand the soaking either.\u201d Shen Zechuan shifted away his foot, refusing to let Xiao Chiye grab it. He lowered his eyes to look at Xiao Chiye and said, \u201cThe low-lying areas of Donglong Street are all impoverished brothels. They are all now soaking in filthy waters.\u201dXiao Chiye remained squatting the way he was and raised his head to say, \u201cThose brothels normally don\u2019t pick patrons. They accept everyone who has a few copper coins to spare and let them do as they please. They can\u2019t afford to pay taxes at all, and are always in arrears year after year. The lower levels at the Ministry of Revenue who pass their days counting copper coins2\u00a0 are a worthless bunch with the specific intent to leave them out to dry in the air.\u201d\u201cThe residential area has also been submerged.\u201d Shen Zechuan said.\u201cThey are all used to waiting; it\u2019ll be fine once spring is over.\u201d Xiao Chiye got up and said, \u201cThere are plenty of people available to work on it, but those who are willing to handle work without any merit to earn are few and far between. I have yet to eat after court dismissal today. Let\u2019s have our meal together.\u201dThe maidservant came over to prepare wooden clogs for Shen Zechuan. Even after putting on the wooden clogs, they did not make him taller than Xiao Chiye. Xiao Chiye looked at Shen Zechuan\u2019s slender and pretty ankles in those socks and thought of the medicine the latter had been consuming in the past.\u201cI don\u2019t see you gaining weight during the new year.\u201d Xiao Chiye pushed the door open and led him outside.\u201cI\u2019m so busy that I only sleep for four hours a day.\u201d Shen Zechuan pattered on the ground with his clogs. \u201cI initially thought that the Southern Judge was an idle position with little to do. Who knew that the ways of the military craftsmen would be that many?\u201d\u201cIf Xi Hongxuan can\u2019t keep you.\u201d Xiao Chiye turned his head aside. \u201cSwitch over to this Second Young Master\u2019s camp while you still can.\u201d\u201cThen I reckon I won\u2019t even have four hours to sleep.\u201d Shen Zechuan followed after him. \u201cThe remaining men from the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are mostly those who inherited the positions and follow in their fathers\u2019 footsteps; they rely on their ancestors for their meals. The benefits that come with the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0aren\u2019t worth much in their eyes.\u201dThe snow was in the midst of melting these few days, and so the yard was wet as well. Xiao Chiye strode across the water puddle and turned back to look at Shen Zechuan for a moment.Although Shen Zechuan was wearing the clogs, the hem of his lunar white3\u00a0robe would trail into the water unless he held it up. At present, it was already dark. Their surrounding was bright and clear set against the backdrop of the white, charming moon hanging up high far on the horizon. The contrast also made Shen Zechuan\u2019s reflection in the water puddle thin and pleasing. He was so focused on the road as he spoke that he did not notice when Xiao Chiye had stopped. He lifted his white robe and, like a child, skipped over the water puddle and landed right before Xiao Chiye.Without even thinking, Xiao Chiye leaned over to hug him around his waist and hoist him over his shoulder. The wooden clogs slipped to the ground, and Xiao Chiye picked them up. With one hand carrying the wooden clogs and one hand around Shen Zechuan, he headed back to the house where they had drank wine the last time.Chen Yang retreated several steps back and gestured to the guards at the back, dismissing everyone in the yard with a silent wave of his hand. Ding Tao did not dare to utter a sound on the rooftop and only showed his eyes as he watched the Second Young Master carry Shen Zechuan over his shoulder. Qiao Tianya and Gu Jin each squatted at the projecting tiles of the eaves and took a sip of wine in unison.\u201cYou didn\u2019t look too good this morning.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cYou\u2019re burning up. Have you fallen ill?\u201dSprawled over his shoulder, Shen Zechuan watched the moon on the ground and said, \u201c\u2026 Perhaps.\u201d\u201cThe grand ambition for supremacy is not something that can be accomplished at a single stroke.\u201d Xiao Chiye ascended the stairs and kicked the door open. \u201cLife is the most precious of all.\u201d\u201cThis wasn\u2019t what you said back then when you hated me.\u201d Shen Zechuan landed on a mass of softness. He gazed at Xiao Chiye. \u201cJust a minor illness. I\u2019ll sleep it off.\u201dWithout looking at him, Xiao Chiye took off his own shoes and removed his outer robe. The maidservants entered in a single, ordered file and set the plates on the small table to serve up the dishes.Shen Zechuan finished washing his hands and was about to pull at his collar again when Xiao Chiye reached out his hand from the side to pull it for him. He used his fingers to part the collar gently and saw some red rashes.\u201cIt\u2019s been too damp lately.\u201d Shen Zechuan nudged away Xiao Chiye\u2019s hand with the back of his hand. \u201cIn order to stake their claims on the site, the eaves of the neighbors\u2019 houses have even blocked out all the light.\u201dXiao Chiye seemed to pay it no mind and let the matter drop with an \u201cuh-huh\u201d.Both men took their seat. As they were eating, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThat residence of yours is no longer befitting of your status. Why haven\u2019t you moved?\u201dShen Zechuan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s close to Zhao Zui Temple, which makes it convenient for me to see\u00a0shifu. It\u2019s also on Donglong Street. If there\u2019re any movements from Xi Hongxuan, it\u2019d be easier to look into it.\u201dXiao Chiye watched him eat and said, \u201cJi Gang-shifu\u00a0can\u2019t keep staying at Zhao Zui Temple as an errand-runner. It\u2019d be more convenient for you to act if you were to relocate and live together.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cLet me see if I can find any suitable residences these days.\u201dAs a matter of fact, he still had Grand Mentor Qi\u2019s residence in his hands. But it would not do for him to live in that residence now; it was too ostentatious and would draw too much attention. Moving house was simple; what was hard was that Xi Hongxuan was keeping a close watch on him. He dared not put his\u00a0shifu\u00a0and teacher at risk.It was already very late after their meal, and the weather was still cold. Shen Zechuan stood up and prepared to take his leave, but Xiao Chiye opened the windows and let out a whistle at the rooftop.Three guards plus one Meng poked their heads out in unison.Propping himself against the window ledge, Xiao Chiye watched Shen Zechuan pick his coat up and said to them, \u201cClose the doors. His Excellency the Judge is not leaving tonight.\u201dShen Zechuan looked back.Xiao Chiye did not smile. His flippancy in the morning seemed to have been blown away by the night wind. Concealed in those eyes were the secluded forest and thick fog, made even more hazy and deep under the moonlight.Perhaps he is really an old hand when it comes to romantic liaisons.Shen Zechuan thought.Just the expression in these eyes of his alone was enough.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 : Shackles\u201cWith early spring approaching, many troublesome matters have cropped up. We have yet to discuss a plan today. It wouldn\u2019t be easy to see each other again if you just leave now.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cSo rest up here tonight.\u201dShen Zechuan broke into a smile and said, \u201cNo hanky-panky.\u201dThe way he enunciated these words were melodious, with a hint of sensual suggestiveness lingering on the tip of his tongue. His eyes were clearly stirring up the waves of lust; even the fingers he had released from his grip at the drop of his words were plucking away at the strings of desires, rousing it.This despicable man.Xiao Chiye watched Shen Zechuan intently and thought to himself.This was the real bad egg. He kept pushing against the boundaries of his diminishing limit every given second and trampled all over his endurance with cunningness and naivety, as if he was leaning next to his ear and calling him to \u201ccome mess with me\u201d. The tail of the sinner that was this fox tickled its way to his legs, his eyes full of tease.\u201cSerious matters.\u201d Xiao Chiye closed the windows. \u201cMust be seriously discussed.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u201cPrepare a memorial tomorrow morning regarding the public ditches, and I\u2019ll bring it up to His Majesty.\u201d Xiao Chiye lay on the rattan chair and picked up the robe that had slipped onto the floor. One by one, he set the items in the sleeve pocket onto a cabinet shelf.\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d Shen Zechuan soaked in the bathwater and said after giving it some thought, \u201cYou\u2019re the Viceroy of the\u00a0Imperial Army; you are not in charge of the official proceedings of public works, nor the complaints of the commoners. It does not concern you. You will definitely draw suspicion to yourself if you submit a memorial out of the blue.\u201d\u201cThen you bring it up. You live there, so it is not strange for you to mention it. I\u2019ll make a note to go along as the accompanying supervisor.\u201d Xiao Chiye fished out an ivory folding fan. He asked, \u201cWhy are you carrying an ivory one?\u201dThe literati, who kept items of elegance in their sleeves and were particular about portraying themselves as distinguished and sophisticated, viewed the likes of ivory and ebony as the most unbearably vulgar. Therefore, descendants of the noble clans would never bring with them folding fans made of sandalwood or ivory as they went out, regardless of whether they were well-read in the classics or not. Most used folding fans of\u00a0moso\u00a0bamboo, adorned with calligraphy by famous calligraphers.Shen Zechuan said, \u201cFor fun. Such an uncouth object suits me the best.\u201dHe had stayed in Zhao Zui Temple for five years, so he could not engage in literary pursuits with the noble descendants. He had to be an uncouth commoner who was a culture snob feigning to be refined. Only this would be right, and only this would be fitting. So besides the ivory folding fan that he always carried with him, he had picked the most expensive-looking kind for his jade pendant that he hung by his waist.Having done groping around Shen Zechuan\u2019s sleeve pocket, Xiao Chiye realized that they were truly polar opposites.Xiao Chiye\u2019s likes and dislikes seemed to be clearly distinguished on the outside. Yet if one had really dug deeper, they would realize that these distinctions were rather murky. Most of the activities he seemed to indulge in could be forgotten as soon as he closed his eyes; there were none that he truly took to heart. On the contrary, what seemed to be shady deals he engaged in to get by were the results of his own sweat and blood. He did not have a favorite dish, nor did he have a favorite wine. All one could say when the topic was brought up was that \u201cthe Second Young Master loves to drink\u201d. But what exactly did the Second Young Master like to drink? No one could really say.On the other hand, Shen Zechuan looked as though he had no preferences and could go along with anything. But feel him up a little, and one would be able to get a clear grasp on his likes and dislikes. He did not like strong bitter tea; just one sip, and he would never ever touch it a second time. He loved eating fish. As long as the location was right and no one was watching, he could debone the fish just as cleanly and neatly as a cat.Xiao Chiye found it amusing.It was as if he had seen Shen Zechuan\u2019s soft spots.Shen Zechuan\u2019s waist. Shen Zechuan\u2019s back. Shen Zechuan\u2019s shoulder blades. He could recognize all these, even with his eyes closed.A boaster.1Xiao Chiye thought to himself with lowered eyes as he held the robes.He could intimidate a person with a sudden glance. But after a few embraces, Xiao Chiye could sense the joy and anger behind all those gentle words and flattery of his. He was just like the moon reflected in the water puddle tonight, where one provocation did not seem like it would stir up any great waves. But in fact, he had already put a black mark against you in his book and would find the next opportunity to kick back at you.Shen Zechuan came out with his robe draped over his shoulders. His hair was still damp. Turning his head, he saw Xiao Chiye seated in the chair, playing with that ivory folding of his. His own clothes were neatly hung at the side.\u201cWe aren\u2019t done discussing,\u201d Xiao Chiye stood up. \u201cDrink the ginger soup and sit down to talk.\u201dShen Zechuan stretched out his hand to raise the curtains, but Xiao Chiye beat him to it and raised it with the fan. Both men stepped out. Most of the lights in the inner chamber were already extinguished, leaving only a glazed lamp lit.Shen Zechuan felt a little hot. After downing a bowl of ginger soup, he felt better. Although he was fine during the day, he was feeling dizzy and heavy-headed now.\u201cXi Hongxuan has been transferred to the Ministry of Revenue. The assessment for officials is around the corner, and he\u2019s in the Bureau of Evaluations.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThis will interfere with the officials\u2019 observational appraisals from the inspections. Did you come up with this idea for him?\u201dShen Zechuan shook his head with the ginger soup in his mouth. After swallowing it down, he said, \u201cIt should be Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s idea.\u201d\u201cI have men in both the Ministry of Rites and the Ministry of War. If they were to be transferred out because of the assessment this round,\u201d Xiao Chiye looked at him, \u201cthen our losses will far outweigh the gains.\u201dShen Zechuan nodded and said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t something to worry too much about. Other than the connection through marriage between the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Rites, Jiang Xu, and the Deputy General, Zhao Hui, the others aren\u2019t too conspicuous. I can\u2019t see how Xue Xiuzhuo would get a thorough read on you either. Just let everyone conduct their businesses as usual. Besides, the inspections and assessments won\u2019t be carried out by just one clan. Secretariat Elder Hai will send his men over too. Xi Hongxuan won\u2019t dare to act too brazenly.\u201d\u201cThe inspection this time concerns Zhongbo. The snowstorm a while back has brought hardships upon Zhongbo; ten or so people in total have died one after another. Hai Liangyi should be sending an official over this year to rectify the problem.\u201d Xiao Chiye said.\u201cZhongbo.\u201d Shen Zechuan seemed to think back on it. \u201cZhongbo\u2026 isn\u2019t easy to manage now. Should they send a literary official, he can\u2019t be guaranteed to hold up his own against the bandits, nor will he be able to command the newly dispatched garrison troops. There needs to be a proper plan for this place; even Secretariat Elder Hai himself would have to fret over it.\u201d\u201cAt present, there is no suitable candidate in\u00a0Qudu. It\u2019s all negotiable as long as the one assigned is not from the noble clan. Cizhou has a bearing on the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path; it\u2019d be inviting trouble if Cizhou were to fall into their hands. There is a need to plan ahead for rainy days\u2026 plan ahead for rainy days.\u201d Xiao Chiye softened his tone as he looked at Shen Zechuan\u2019s weary face.After Shen Zechuan\u2019s promotion, he had been running around on assignments on both ends. At night, he often had to be at Ouhua Pavilion and socialize with Xi Hongxuan, who had fair maidens in his arms and a position with practically no obligations. And because he wrote tunes for Li Jianheng, he did not even have to attend\u00a0morning court\u00a0sessions; he had plenty of time to rest. But Shen Zechuan had to stand guard before the Emperor every day with his blade. He did not sleep at night, and in the day, he even had to deal with military craftsmen of all sorts. He was even busier when he was on duty, so much that he might not necessarily get the chance to eat his meals.He did not even have the time to bother about his residence on Donglong Street, which had been devoid of light due to the blockage of the protruding edges of his neighbors\u2019 eaves. It was only yesterday that he realized that his courtyard was already flooded. The bedding in the house was so damp that there was no way he could stay there. He could send Qiao Tianya over to Zhao Zui Temple to stay with his\u00a0shifu\u00a0and teacher. But he himself was not at liberty to.He looked even thinner now, let alone talk about gaining weight after the new year.Xiao Chiye watched him for a long time, then reached out his hand across the small table to stroke Shen Zechuan\u2019s cheek. That cheek was unbelievably scalding hot; it was far from \u201ca little hot\u201d. Medicine had yet to be applied on the rashes on his neck. Xiao Chiye wanted to call out to him, and yet at the same time, he did not feel like doing so.But his touch woke Shen Zechuan up. Shen Zechuan braced himself to keep his spirits up and said, \u201c\u2026 Uh-huh, we do have to plan ahead for rainy days. The\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his words, Xiao Chiye had already leaned over to him. Xiao Chiye\u2019s arms were strong and sturdy, and it was effortless for him to pick up Shen Zechuan. The bowl on the table was knocked over, and Xiao Chiye used his leg to kick it away as he said in a leisurely and carefree manner, \u201cThis Second Young Master will now take you to the nuptial chamber.\u201dShen Zechuan wiped the sweat from his forehead and let himself hang over him, saying, \u201cHave we already finished discussing the serious matters tonight?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re done.\u201d Xiao Chiye clasped him around his back and said, \u201cAnd now, it\u2019s time to repay your debt.\u201dAfter saying this, he bent his back to lay Shen Zechuan on the bedding.Shen Zechuan shielded his face from the light with his hand and said under his breath, \u201cNo lights.\u201d\u201cAll the clearer to see you with if there\u2019s a little light.\u201d Xiao Chiye undressed Shen Zechuan in this position.Shen Zechuan\u2019s chest was exposed, and he suddenly felt a coldness on his nape. He looked at Xiao Chiye through the gaps between his fingers. Xiao Chiye dipped his fingers into the ointment and dabbed it on the rashes. This whole process was as if he was oiling a piece of jade. The more he applied, the smoother it felt. It was so smooth Xiao Chiye\u2019s heart was wavering out of control. He really did not have the makings of a gentleman.\u201cI\u2019ll have to tie you up in a while, so you don\u2019t roll all over the place. Otherwise, this ointment would have been applied in vain.\u201d Xiao Chiye closed the ointment box and took out a handkerchief to wipe his fingers slowly as he sat on the edge of the bed. He said self-mockingly, \u201cYou are the only one this Second Young Master has ever served in his life.\u201dShen Zechuan slipped into the bedding and turned his head aside to sleep.Xiao Chiye sat for a while before he rose to blow out the last lamp. The bed sank as Xiao Chiye hugged Shen Zechuan around his waist from behind and pulled him over from the edge of the bed to hold him captive in the crooks of his arms.\u201cGot you bound.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cI\u2019ll throw you out right away if you dare to kick me.\u201dWith opened eyes, Shen Zechuan looked at the window through which hazy moonlight was shining. His icy hands touched Xiao Chiye\u2019s wrists that were restraining him. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re so hard.\u201d\u201cUh-huh.\u201d After a moment of silence, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cI\u2019d advise you not to venture downwards.\u201dShen Zechuan endured it for a while before saying, \u201cI\u2019m talking about your waist token.\u201d\u201cIs it the waist token?\u201d Xiao Chiye tilted his head slightly to the side and pressed it down beside Shen Zechuan\u2019s ear. He repeated, \u201cIs it the waist token?\u201dHis words scalded Shen Zechuan.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cYou can\u2019t take it when I bite your ears, and you start trembling when I just ask a few questions. How dare you laugh at me for being rusty in bed when this is all you\u2019ve got?\u201dShen Zechuan composed himself for a moment before he said, \u201cThen why don\u2019t we try switching positions?\u201dXiao Chiye actually sat up and helped Shen Zechuan sit on top of him. He released his hands and laughed.\u201cUndressing the robes or unbuckling the belts.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cDo as you please.\u201dThere was no knowing whether Shen Zechuan was too sick or too feverish, but his breathing was in disarray, and he was not as composed as he always was. He said softly, \u201cTonight\u2013\u2013\u201dShen Zechuan had yet to finish his words when Xiao Chiye held down the back of his head to kiss him ever so fiercely and guided his hand down to his sweet spot. Shen Zechuan cowered back. Xiao Chiye laughed at him until Shen Zechuan felt indignant and started to struggle.Xiao Chiye suddenly turned over and pinned him down once again under his body. The bed let out a creak, and the bedding sank. It was so burning hot that Shen Zechuan\u2019s palms were sweating.Xiao Chiye\u2019s temperature was scalding. Shen Zechuan loathed this blazing heat, but he seemed to have nowhere to run; yet at the same time, there seemed to be still room for maneuver. They lurked in this intricate labyrinth-like game of chess, gaining a moment of reprieve from the illusion of mutual dependence they came to possess in the throes of passion and intimacy.Once they sank deep into indulgence, the feeling of ecstasy urged them onward. Sweet, drunken whispers resonated in their ears. Even though Shen Zechuan loathed that numbing heat, he was pushing Xiao Chiye away, and at the same time, also pulling Xiao Chiye towards himself.Xiao Chiye tore away those clothes and pushed himself up along Shen Zechuan\u2019s back. Just as Xiao Chiye had fantasized when he sat in the rattan chair, he did not miss a single inch of Shen Zechuan. He dominated this man, forcefully using his own scent to overpower the latter.Shen Zechuan wrapped his arms around Xiao Chiye\u2019s neck and bit him. The two nuzzled the tips of their noses together, once again forging an extraordinary closeness in this moment of madness and depravity.Kissing him, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201dThose torrents of bites that fell like a raging storm gradually settled into tender kisses, and the softness of lips and tongues dissolved away all defenses. It was under these intermittent murmurs of words that the insane man fell asleep.Xiao Chiye caressed Shen Zechuan\u2019s cheek with his thumb and propped himself up slightly. Shen Zechuan was still grasping some of Xiao Chiye\u2019s hair between his fingers as he slept soundly. Xiao Chiye lowered his head and scrutinized him. In that instant, many thoughts ran through his mind.Desire is a shackle.In this moment, Xiao Chiye invited Zuo Qianqiu over to\u00a0Qudu. Just to ask\u00a0shifu\u00a0one question.Can desire be conquered?But in the end, he did not voice his question.Because he already knew that it was a question that Zuo Qianqiu had no answer for; the only one who could answer it was Xiao Chiye himself. Many people had said that he had been born at the wrong time, but he had already come into this world. To be in possession of desire was not a fault of his own making.He was merely a human.His name was Xiao Chiye.He seemed to be the polar opposite of Shen Zechuan, yet he also seemed to be completely similar. The only one in this world who could understand the entirety of Xiao Chiye\u2019s pain and suffering without any use of words was Shen Zechuan. And this was something they were perfectly well aware of since their very first kiss.Xiao Chiye kissed Shen Zechuan between his brows and on the bridge of his nose.It did not matter by which name this feeling was called. They mutually staked their claims on one another, increasingly growing closer amidst their struggles. The pit of desire was bottomless, and the abyss of misery, unsurmountable. Grinding against each other ear to ear, temple to temple,2\u00a0was a way to wear down their agony. But this way was getting too addictive, as if they could mutually alleviate their own pain by simply being next to each other.After that bout of insatiable pleasure-making, they tacitly began to shed their shells and reveal their true selves. The ravine of the past had become a puddle; it was as if all it took was a single leap or a single helping hand to stride over it before merging once again into one.Xiao Chiye kissed Shen Zechuan again, and Shen Zechuan, in his slumber, tightened his grip on Xiao Chiye\u2019s little braids.Ripples washed over the white moon in the water puddle under the abundance of cool breeze, while the Heartbreaker and the Loverboy slept the entire night away nestled under the blanket of the moonlight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 : CollapseAs the hour of\u00a0yin1\u00a0approached, it suddenly rained. Chen Yang washed up in the resting hall. After wiping his face, he looked outside to see a drizzle of misty rain adorned with tiny flakes of snow.\u201cHave the kitchen heat up the stove.\u201d Chen Yang instructed to his left and right. \u201cServe up the medicine for colds while it\u2019s hot, then prepare the ginger soup. Has Master and the Judge\u2019s official robes been steamed? Send them over quickly. It\u2019s raining and snowing today, and the ground is slippery. Be careful when you go in and out to serve; don\u2019t fall, lest you make a disgrace of yourself.\u201dBefore the day broke, those who served in the courtyard were already moving. Chen Yang held up an umbrella and made his way to the kitchen to check on the day\u2019s breakfast. When the cook saw him, he hurriedly got the attendant to get the lunchboxes.\u201cI heard last night that the Judge had fallen ill. So I made fish soup this morning, along with some light side dishes. I\u2019ve also prepared rice porridge and steamed twisted rolls.\u201d2\u00a0The cook personally handed the lunchboxes to Chen Yang. \u201cThese are breakfast for you gentlemen. All of you have been on guard the entire night last night. Drink something hot to dispel the chill.\u201dChen Yang laughed when he touched the lunchboxes and said, \u201cAlright. You even prepare\u00a0shaojiu\u00a0wine3\u00a0for Gu Jin. I shall thank you on his behalf! Get someone to serve up Master\u2019s breakfast without delay. I\u2019ll hurry over to wait on him first.\u201dThe cook sent him out, and the attendant wanted to continue sending him on his way. Chen Yang turned the latter down and hurried back to the courtyard with his umbrella up.The three meals of guards like them cannot be touched by anyone else. They could only take turns to get it themselves. This was a hard and fast rule that had been laid down back in Libei.Chen Yang arrived at the courtyard and called down the other three men. They opened the lunchboxes and stood together to have their meals.Biting on the steamed bun, Ding Tao looked at the house and said, \u201cMaster is up.\u201dGu Jin said, \u201cIs the horse carriage ready? He\u2019s running a little late today.\u201dChen Yang nodded and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to rain today. Master still has to soak in the rain later when he arrives at the palace and waits to sign his name. His Excellency the Judge\u2019s cold won\u2019t go away for quite a while. Does he not plan to take a leave of absence?\u201dWho\u2019s he asking?Gu Jin and Ding Tao looked at each other, then simultaneously looked at Qiao Tianya, who had come along for the free meal.Qiao Tianya drank the porridge in one mouthful and held up a finger. Before he could speak, the other three said in unison, \u201cSwallow!\u201dHe swallowed and said, \u201cHe won\u2019t dare to take even a day off. My master is still considered a newly appointed official. How would he dare to be the first to take leave when the senior above him is still fine? He can\u2019t be busier than the Commander-in-chief, can he?\u201dDing Tao said, \u201cYou\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are really no-good. Even when it comes to falling sick, you have to talk about seniority!\u201dQiao Tianya said, \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. Everyone at the top and bottom is watching.\u201dAs the four of them ate and chatted, the door on the other side opened. The maidservants entered and exited with serving trays in hands.Shen Zechuan was drenched in sweat after being embraced by Xiao Chiye for the entire night. The rashes on his neck had not gone away.Xiao Chiye had already put on his clothes. Seeing that Shen Zechuan still did not look too good, he set his fingers against Shen Zechuan\u2019s forehead and said, \u201cThe medicine is on the table. Drink it while it\u2019s hot.\u201dShen Zechuan put on his boots and got off to drink the medicine before he draped his clothes around him to put it on. Both men stood back to back before the mirror amid the rustling sound of clothes scraping across skins and fabrics.Shen Zechuan fastened his waist belt and pushed the window open to look at the sky. He said, \u201cThis rain really comes at a bad time.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no movement last night. It\u2019s still not too late to unclog the ditches today.\u201dXiao Chiye came closer. The maidservant behind him who was trying to put on his crown for him could not reach him, so Shen Zechuan reached out to take it. Xiao Chiye propped himself against the window, and Shen Zechuan put it on for him. Both men locked gazes with one another.\u201cSmells bitter.\u201d Xiao Chiye said.\u201cIf you come any closer,\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cthe smell will be even stronger.\u201dThe maidservants at the sides lowered themselves, not daring to make a sound.Qiao Tianya was already holding up the umbrella just before they stepped out. Shen Zechuan descended the stairs. He had yet to walk out of the courtyard when he saw Tantai Hu hurrying over. Tantai Hu still did not look too good when he saw Shen Zechuan, but he still bowed to him in greeting before striding up the stairs in a hurry.\u201cLaohu!\u201d Chen Yang greeted him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dXiao Chiye had already come out. Gu Jin put on his cloak for him while Xiao Chiye looked at Tantai Hu and said nothing.Tantai Hu kneeled on one knee and reported in an urgent tone. \u201cViceroy! The Donglong Street patrol squad sent back word earlier that Ouhua Pavilion has collapsed!\u201dShen Zechuan halted in his tracks and waited for Tantai Hu to continue.Tantai Hu wiped away the rainwater on his face and said, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for it to collapse on the Second Young Master of the Xi Clan. But who knew His Majesty was inside too!\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s gaze was cutting cold. As he raised his head, the rain and snow fell even harder.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan took large strides out of the office. Ge Qingqing was already waiting at the bottom of the stairs. As Shen Zechuan hung up his waist token, he said, \u201cTell me the details.\u201dThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0swiftly followed him out of the courtyard. With a hand on his blade, Ge Qingqing whispered, \u201cHis Majesty sneaked out on the sly. No one knew about this when the building collapsed this morning. When those courtesans were dug out, men from the Eight Great Training Divisions were still urgently looking for Xi Hongxuan. Who would have expected His Majesty to be missing when the eunuch lifted the curtain for a look once the time came for the palace\u2019s\u00a0morning court\u00a0session to start? They couldn\u2019t find him. At first, they went to Caiwei Palace to check with Imperial Concubine Mu, but Imperial Concubine Mu had no idea either. That was when chaos erupted. It was only when the presences of Empress Dowager and Third Missy Hua were requested and the palace maids serving him were interrogated that we learned that His Majesty had disguised as an eunuch last night and insisted on going with Xi Hongxuan to Ouhua Pavilion for some fun.\u201dShen Zechuan did not look pleased as he said, \u201cThere are patrol checks at all levels in the inner palace. He must have had help; otherwise, he won\u2019t even be able to stride out of Mingli Hall.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the odd thing.\u201d Ge Qingqing lowered his voice even more. \u201cDuring my questioning, I heard the guards say that no one came in or out at all last night.\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s expression remained unchanged as he detachedly watched the Eight Great Training Divisions march past in formation. He walked the entire way in a hurry, braving the rain; no one dared to hold up their umbrellas at this moment. Dark clouds hung over each of the official\u2019s faces, their gloomy expressions so somber it was as if their parents died.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Hai Liangyi and Xiao Chiye stood before the collapsed building. The collapse of Ouhua Pavilion had consequently brought down half the street of closely clustered buildings with it. The swill in the gutter had long overflowed, causing the entire Donglong Street to reek to high heaven in this downpour. Everyone had to wade through the water to make their way through.The Minister of Works, Pan Xiangjie, was the head of the Pan Clan\u2014one of the\u00a0eight great clans. Although he shared the same surname as Pan Rugui from the reign of Xiande, Pan Rugui was really not in the same league as them. Pan Xiangjie was of the same age as Hai Liangyi, and had never dared to commit any major blunder while he held this position. Knowing that he would never make it into the Grand Secretariat, he had always been careful and prudent with the hope of retiring in peace after a few more days, especially since his son was already the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue. He had never expected to get himself some sleep, only for the sky to collapse when he woke up!Pan Xiangjie could not even stand steady on his feet, and he was so anxious his hands trembled. He kept saying, \u201cQuick. Dig quickly. His Majesty is still inside!\u201dThe rainwater had doused Hai Liangyi to the point he was expressionless. He had never thought that Li Jianheng would be so muddle-headed to such an extent just to play! Several times, he wiped away the rainwater, looking as though he was also wiping away his tears. He said to Xiao Chiye, \u201cDig\u2026 Rescue His Majesty first!\u201dXiao Chiye took off his cloak and waded his way down through the water to take a look at the situation. The current stand-in for the Eight Great Training Divisions was Han Cheng\u2019s younger brother, Han Jin. Han Jin rolled up the legs of his trousers and lifted the hem of his robe to follow Xiao Chiye down.\u201cViceroy.\u201d Han Jin shouted in the rain. \u201cThe bottom is already hollowed out. We dare not dig!\u201dNot only was the lower area hollowed out, but it was also all set with vats and jars. But no one dared to voice it out. These vats and jars had been smashed when the building collapsed. If Li Jianheng were to be squashed underneath, then he was really a goner! The first emperor in the history of Dazhou who was crushed to death when he sneaked out for a rendezvous\u2014Which historian would dare to write it? No one had ever seen anything so depressing.\u201cHis Majesty rested in the upper area last night.\u201d Shen Zechuan removed his blade and got into the water. He said, \u201cThe place isn\u2019t deep.\u201d\u201cI fear it will collapse further.\u201d Xiao Chiye raised his body. \u201cCall the men from the Ministry of Works over.\u201dCen Yu had just rushed his way over. The moment Shen Zechuan saw him, he immediately said to Hai Liangyi, \u201cSecretariat Elder, the public ditch must be dredged today. If this rain doesn\u2019t stop, we won\u2019t be able to drain the water.\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s near the Kailing River at the back too.\u201d Cen Yu said. \u201cI went to take a look earlier. The buildings along the banks have already all collapsed. The foundation at the bottom has long been soaked rotten! How long has it been since the stone bricks on the dam have been repaired? If the water rises later, half of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0will be flooded! What has the Ministry of Works been doing all these years?! Pan Xiangjie, you muddle-headed fool! How many times have I told you about this, huh?!\u201dPan Xiangjie fell to his knees with a \u201cthud\u201d. His old mob of hair was already half-white. He burst out wailing, \u201cWhat can I do?! Can you blame me for this? Those from the Ministry of Revenue are all influential bureaucrats. I\u2019ve already mentioned this to them eight hundred years ago. What can I do if they don\u2019t allocate the funds and transfer manpower?! Cen Xunyi, what can I do?!\u201d He scooped up this swill water, unable to speak as he choked with sobs. Kowtowing on the ground with his head, he cried out, \u201cWe are going to have to pay for this with our lives!\u201d\u201cYou are a senior of the present imperial court. Stop disgracing yourself!\u201d Hai Liangyi suddenly cut him off and bellowed. \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s fate hangs in the balance; we don\u2019t know if he\u2019s dead or alive. It\u2019s an emergency now. Even if you want to shirk responsibility and shift the blame, at least wait for him to be rescued first! Assign 800 men from the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s current defense and follow the Ministry of Works to unclog the public ditch immediately. Tear down all the houses that have violated the regulations and occupied land illegally. As for the Ministry of Revenue, total up the state treasury money without delay and assemble the victims of those whose houses have collapsed at Zhao Zui Temple to centralize the distribution of aid reliefs. The Eight Great Training Divisions shall patrol the major city gates. All entries and exits must be accompanied by diplomatic notes and official documents. We are at the critical juncture now. I expect everyone to work as one to stabilize the situation. Don\u2019t lose your composure!\u201dWith that, Hai Liangyi suddenly looked at Shen Zechuan.\u201cHave the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0guard the inner palace. You mustn\u2019t let any other people take advantage of this situation to stir up trouble. If there\u2019s anyone who rebels, then act in accordance with my orders and execute them on the spot!\u201dThose starting to get restless in this heavy downpour instantly calmed down under this succession of commands teeming with murderous intent. Hai Liangyi walked a few steps and removed his\u00a0wusha\u00a0hat4\u00a0in the rain.\u201cHis Majesty is the\u00a0Son of Heaven.\u201d With rainwater sliding down and dripping off his face, Hai Liangyi said with finality, \u201cOur Dazhou has been in power for a century. It\u2019s still not the time for its demise.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Li Jianheng was stuck underneath broken wood, facing down. The icy cold water pouring on his neck jolted him awake. He found it hard to breathe. His chest was too tightly wedged, and his ribs were hurting terribly.Li Jianheng coughed and shouted in a raspy voice, \u201cS-save me\u2014\u201dThese sounds were hoarse and powerless, too quiet to be heard in the downpour.Li Jianheng shifted his gaze to see that the courtesan beside him had already gone cold. Her ghastly white flesh lay squashed between broken walls, and several strands of her hair had been stained red from the dripping blood. Li Jianheng began to tremble; he could no longer recognize this to be the beauty he had been clapping hands and dancing with last night.\u201cSave me.\u201dLi Jianheng hung down his head and said with all his effort.\u201cSave me.\u201dThe coughs of someone choking on water rang out below him. Half of Xi Hongxuan\u2019s body was soaked in the water. He was half on his back, having crashed down right on top of the jars, and his bloodied back was badly mangled. He gasped for air and said, \u201cYour Majesty, stop calling for them. No one can hear you.\u201dLi Jianheng was beside himself as he pushed at the broken pieces of wood with his elbows, but it was all in vain. One of his shoes had fallen off, and he was so freezing cold that his face had gone pale. He said, \u201cSomeone will definitely come to save me\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Xi Hongxuan began laughing in a muffled voice. \u201cYou are the\u00a0Son of Heaven.\u201dLi Jianheng said, \u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201dXi Hongxuan smacked his lips and spat out some sandy mud. He said, \u201cI\u2019m laughing at this thing called fate\u2026 Don\u2019t you find it strange how people seem to be repeating the cycle of life on the wheel of reincarnation?\u201dLi Jianheng lifted his eyelids but could see nothing. He said darkly, \u201cNo\u2026 There\u2019s no cycle\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Majesty\u2019s birth mother of the Yue Clan\u2026\u201d Xi Hongxuan shifted his body with some difficulty. \u201c\u2026 was drowned in the same way.\u201dSplash.The dirty, foul water moved away from his neck and splashed somewhere else. In this minute trickle flow, Li Jianheng swallowed.Drowned.With difficulty, Li Jianheng recalled those fleeting and ephemeral childhood memories. He looked at that morbidly white flesh once again, yet it seemed to be his mother he was seeing.The woman was pressed into the swill bucket, her fingernails raking at the ground until they were bloodied pulps of flesh. As water splashed on her face, Li Jianheng saw her ghastly white neck and arms.Drowned.Li Jianheng\u2019s tears welled up. He frantically covered his eyes with his hands and yelled resentfully, \u201cShut up! You shut up!\u201dXi Hongxuan fell silent.But Li Jianheng no longer wanted to stay close to this body any longer. He started to cry and shoot his mouth off, hurling abuses and profanities as he said, \u201cDon\u2019t mention her! I am the supreme ruler on the imperial throne! My\u2014\u201dLi Jianheng rasped for air, his face looking sinister through the gaps of his ten fingers.\u201cMy mother is the current Empress Dowager!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 : Family BackgroundLi Jianheng never spoke of his birth mother to anyone else, because the topic was his sore spot. His birth mother of the Yue Clan did not have an imperial concubine title and was just a lowly palace maid. Official records had her surname shoddily listed as \u201cYue\u201d, and that was all the information provided on her.When Li Jianheng was still in swaddles, Emperor Xiande\u2019s birth mother, Lady Lu, brought him back into her palace, but she merely fed and clothed him. His lack of education and skills today was all because no one remembered him when he was supposed to begin schooling. Subsequently, he spent all his time playing with the eunuchs.He did not have an imperial concubine mother, only a nanny.His nanny was the lover of the personal eunuch serving Emperor Xiande. She was a snob, and she treated Li Jianheng cruelly. Every day, she dressed him up until he looked all fine and presentable, yet he often woke up hungry in the night. Li Jianheng did tell his older brother about this once, and Emperor Xiande threw a fit at his personal eunuch. The eunuch then went back to cuss and hit the nanny. The next day onwards, the nanny gave Li Jianheng the cold shoulder and served him cold meals. She never hit him, but she had a tongue so sharp and cutting that Li Jianheng never dared to mention it to anyone again. Before he learned how to speak properly, he already knew a whole plethora of vulgar words.His nanny told him that his birth mother was a cheap whore from the palace. Because of her secret pregnancy that was the result of an illicit relationship, she was kept indoors by the former Lady of the palace to recuperate. Although the word was \u201crecuperate\u201d, she never left the compound for years and was deathly ill. She even kept harboring the wishful thinking of getting the chance to meet her son and speak to him.When Li Jianheng was five, Emperor Guangcheng came to Lady Lu\u2019s palace to check on Emperor Xiande\u2019s, Li Jianyun, progress with schoolwork. As they were speaking, Li Jianheng, who was playing cricket with others, was seen by Emperor Guangcheng, who called him over. That was his first time meeting his father.The Guangcheng Emperor asked him about some writings.Li Jianheng held the cricket tightly in his hands and did not dare to look at Emperor Guangcheng. He was unable to speak eloquently either, often stuttering and ignorant of what was asked of him.Emperor Guangcheng found him stupid. Li Jianheng was already five, yet he was still unable to articulate himself well, had not an ounce of decorum, and seemed timid. He did not have the aura of a royal scion at all.Li Jianheng really wanted to talk to Emperor Guangcheng, but he was afraid. He did not think that this person was his father, and he even started crying during the lengthy questioning. This made Emperor Guangcheng disdain him utterly. And this first time was also the last time he saw Emperor Guangcheng. It was only when Emperor Guangcheng left that Li Jianheng realized that he had unknowingly squashed the cricket in his hand to death.Li Jianyun thought that this younger brother of his was useless. His health was still fine then, and he was the prince after the Crown Prince, who was the most in favor. He pitied Li Jianheng, so he pleaded with Emperor Guangcheng and started to bring Li Jianheng along to classes with him.Li Jianheng got to know his brothers, but they were all living in the lap of luxury. He slowly came to the realization that they were not his brothers. They ridiculed him; they spoke of protocols and propriety; they made him bow to them. Li Jianheng did not understand. He did not have to kneel and kowtow to his brothers on seeing them, but this was what they taught him. When he did so, not one eunuch or palace maid went forward to help him up.It was only when the Crown Prince and Li Jianyun were around that everyone acted with brotherly affection like kin brothers. Li Jianheng would not say a word about it, and he had no one to tell either. Gradually, he stopped going to school on time. He started to play the fox with Li Jianyun, feigning illness and sleeping in\u2014he would not go if he could help it. Li Jianyun felt that Li Jianheng was a lost cause who could not be taught and set straight. Subsequently, he came to give up too.There was a time when Li Jianheng followed a eunuch through a doghole. He squeezed his way through, and the eunuchs covered their mouths to snicker at him. They gave him candies from the Imperial Bakery. He was like a puppy seeking food, one that had been coaxed into wagging his tail by those few melted candies. It was in that doghole he obtained a lot of food he had never sampled before, and it was also from that doghole he saw his mother.Li Jianheng did not recognize Lady Yue.The eunuch egged Li Jianheng on, calling Yue a \u201cfeeble invalid\u201d, so Li Jianheng spat at her and called her the same. Lady Yue leaned against the wall, crying as she looked at him. Li Jianheng found this woman eccentric. The way she looked at him gave him the heebie-jeebies, so much that even he himself wanted to cry.After getting back, his nanny scolded Li Jianheng again. When Li Jianheng wanted to pee in the middle of the night, he heard the nanny having a secret rendezvous with the eunuch who had egged him into cussing. He was caught red-handed by both of them when he accidentally kicked the chamber pot after he was done peeing.The nanny was afraid that Li Jianheng would tell on them, so after that night, she gave him lots of candies and never scolded him again, instead treating him as though she yearned to hold him in her arms and coax him all day long. There were many kinds of candies, and one of them was called the silk-nested tiger\u2019s eye candy. There was only a little of it every day, which Li Jianheng could not bear to eat; instead, he followed behind Li Jianyun every day and gave it to him to eat. But, from that year onwards, Li Jianyun\u2019s health started to deteriorate to the point he was so sick he could not even attend classes.Lady Lu checked the food and beverages in the palace, but her investigation threw up nothing. Every night, she wept before Li Jianyun. The imperial physicians came and went, but Li Jianyun never got better.The nanny stopped giving Li Jianheng candies. Li Jianheng created a din, demanding his candies, so the nanny told him that the feeble invalid in the Eastern Courtyard who had been cussed by Li Jianheng wanted to tell on him to forbid him from eating candies again. Li Jianheng had been thinking of the silk-nested tiger\u2019s eye candy, and thus, he hated that sickly woman. The nanny also said that if Li Jianheng wanted to eat candies again, he had to complain to Lady Lu and tell her that those earlier candies had been given by the sickly woman.Li Jianheng did not dare to tell Lady Lu, so he secretly told Li Jianyun. Li Jianyun looked at him from where he lay on the couch, and it was in that instant Li Jianheng felt that his elder brother resembled his father.Li Jianheng was roused awake in the night. The nanny led him out, where he heard sploshing sounds from the main hall. From where he was behind the hanging curtain, he saw a blur of human figures. Li Jianyun, who was lying on the couch with an overcoat around him, beckoned to him.Li Jianheng ran over.That sickly woman was half-naked, with her head pressed into the bucket of swill. Again and again, her head was forced into it. She choked and coughed out water, and water poured back into her nose and mouth. Her fingernails had been reduced to bloodied pulps from all that clawing.Li Jianyun held Li Jianheng and said nothing. The sight frightened Li Jianheng, and he looked back many times at Li Jianyun. But there was no smile on Li Jianyun\u2019s face, and so Li Jianheng did not dare to smile too.When the woman was pressed into the bucket, a gurgling sound rang out. She raked her nails on the bucket in agony, her skinny fingers digging into the wood shavings, making the slits in her nails a dirty mess.Li Jianheng looked at her, but he could not remember her face clearly. But the sloshing sound stayed in his memory. The nanny was a tall and healthy woman. Li Jianheng did not like her. All the women he came to choose in the future were petite or sickly.Li Jianheng did not like water either; he found it filthy.After that night, the nanny treated him well. Li Jianyun treated him well, too. It was just that no one mentioned his study anymore, and Li Jianyun no longer kept him to practice calligraphy. Li Jianyun even assigned eunuchs to play with him. Li Jianheng was thoroughly free. He played the whole day until he fell asleep. When he grew to be a teenager and had to move to a separate residence, Li Jianyun sent quite a number of pretty women to his residence. Once Li Jianheng got a taste of them and understood the pleasure of indulging in beautiful women, he spiraled out of control.Until many years later.Li Jianheng found out that that sickly woman was Lady Yue.\u201cMy mother is the current Empress Dowager!\u201dLi Jianheng\u2019s fingers trembled. He seemed to be saying it to Xi Hongxuan and, at the same time, directing it at himself as he muttered these words over and over like a man gone mad.Xi Hongxuan sniffled and listened as Li Jianheng harped on. He could not help but grin and say, \u201cYour Majesty, to let everyone think this, the honor accorded to the Empress Dowager has to be sufficient. And now, the Empress Dowager\u2026\u00a0hisssss.\u201d He sucked in a breath from the pain and continued, \u201c\u2026 happens to lack a son!\u201dLi Jianheng felt a stabbing pain in his chest as he gasped for breath. He haphazardly wiped away his tears with his fingers and said, \u201cI\u2026 I1\u00a0know!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you know.\u201d Xi Hongxuan said.Li Jianheng said, \u201cWho gave you the audacity to\u2026 speak to me in such a manner here?\u201d\u201cThe words of a man on his deathbed always come from the heart.\u201d Blood oozed from Xi Hongxuan\u2019s mouth. He spat a few more times before saying, \u201cIf you and I can\u2019t get out today, then there will be no ruler and his minister; we will be merely rats in a pit waiting to drown in the water! What kind of Emperor are you? When Xiao the Second lifted you onto the dragon throne earlier, you ingratiate yourself with him like you would an ancestor! Have you forgotten? You are his master to begin with. Risking his life to save you is what he should do! What logic is there for parents to be grateful to their sons and grandsons? It\u2019s with the Libei Armored Cavalry that each of the men of the Xiao Clan now enjoy such prestige and power. Such a ridiculous thing would be totally unheard of a few decades back with Emperor Guangcheng at the head! I get truly worried when I look at you! How does it feel to be an Emperor to such an extent? You aren\u2019t even as carefree and happy as I was during the times I was mixing around the salterns being an imperial merchant. If you\u2019re going to remain in this position and suffer such trifle indignities, you might as well drown here with me today.\u201dHurting from having spoken such a big chunk, he grimaced in pain and spent a moment to take a breather. As he listened to Li Jianheng\u2019s sobs, he suddenly began to choke with sobs too.\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d Xi Hongxuan laid bare his feelings and said, \u201cMy mother was a woman from Qinzhou. She was of lowly birth. She could win my father\u2019s favor because her mother\u2019s old man earned some money by relying on the pointers given by the preceding Old Madam Yao. Look at me. I am the second son of lawful birth, but instead of living like a man, I lead a dog\u2019s life back at home. Why do you think I dared to head down to the Xu Sea when I was eighteen to beg for a living among the wind and waves there? It\u2019s all because my parents were biased and handed this massive family fortune to my eldest brother! Later, I met with a disaster at sea. With my constitution wrecked, I had to recuperate in Qinzhou for more than half a year. See how horrifyingly obese I am. It\u2019s all from the nourishments I downed back then to preserve my life. Ugly, right? Haha! But before I was injured, I was also a handsome man in Qinzhou. Before I left, I met a woman whom I loved very much. We were engaged to get married before I set out to sea. But when I returned, she had already married someone else\u2014she became my dear sister-in-law. What a great elder brother Xi Gu\u2019an is. He even had to take care of my woman for me when he heard that I had met with difficulty. Where else can I find such a wonderful elder brother? I\u2019ll thank him all my life!\u201dXi Hongxuan cried and laughed as he spoke in this dimmed, damp, and narrow place.\u201cI\u2019ll freaking thank him all my life! Your Majesty, who in this world isn\u2019t pitiful? Are you willing to let me be the Grand Secretary who holds sway over the imperial court and commoners because you pity me? You pity Xiao the Second! And let him become the tremendously popular Viceroy in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0for a time. But who will pity you? If Xiao the Second is truly sincere towards you, then would he have let Xiao Jiming say that kind of words before you? Isn\u2019t that just abusing his power to bully people around?! Then look again at that Shen the Eighth who has landed himself Shen Wei as his old man. Is the\u00a0imperial prison\u00a0such a fun place to be in? He fell into Ji Lei\u2019s hand at fifteen years of age and was whipped and flayed so badly it was as if he had taken a tumble in hell itself. He may be out of there now, but look at him, he has clearly grown into a specter. Everyone in the world is pitiful. If you pity each and everyone of them, then how are you going to be an emperor? As the saying goes, every man for himself, and the devil takes the hindmost\u2014one has to look out for their own interests first. Your Majesty, don\u2019t listen to all those garrulous people who speak of the lowly origins of their mothers and the likes. Your surname is Li, and mine is Xi. For us, that\u2019s enough! Men are born to be distinguished between the superior and the inferior, the lowly and the nobles! All those rhetorical questions insinuating no one is born to be ruling classes2\u00a0are just to goad and egg on fools. If no one goes by the rules, then where would countries and states come from? Your name is Li Jianheng, and therefore you are born superior to him, Xiao Chiye! What are you afraid of even if his Xiao Clan dares to harbor wicked intentions? You\u2019re the one who has the hearts and minds of all the commoners in the world. No matter what their maneuver is, they are all traitors and rebels! Who in the world would dare to disobey if you raise your arms and make the call? This is what the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u00a0is!\u201dThis is what the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u00a0is!Li Jianheng found these words so rousing and enlightening that it snapped him to his senses. For the first time in this wet and filthy caved-in pit, he came to understand who he was. At some point, the tears were already streaming down his face. He thought back on everything that had transpired in the past, feeling as if he had lived in vain.Unwilling to let this opportunity slip, Xi Hongxuan braced himself and continued in a strained voice, \u201cAre they laughing at you for being uneducated and cowardly? Who in this world doesn\u2019t fear death?! They can say anything they want when the blade is not held against their necks. But when it is, nine out of ten will pee in their pants! You are the emperor, not an artisan! When it comes to matters involving learning, the students from the Imperial College will naturally provide the answers. As for governmental affairs, isn\u2019t that what the Grand Secretariat is for? Isn\u2019t it there to deliberate over matters for you and advise you? You are the Emperor. You are\u00a0an\u00a0emperor!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the Emperor\u2026\u201d Li Jianheng was feeling both hot and cold as he trembled and repeated, \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m the Emperor.\u201dXi Hongxuan grabbed the moment with finesse. Seeing that he was almost there, he heaved a sigh of relief.The fucking nerve of whoever it was to tamper with Ouhua Pavilion! With the building collapsed and flooded, all evidence would have been washed away. With no lead in the investigation, the blame would fall squarely on Xi Hongxuan\u2019s head. If he could not hold Li Jianheng in his grasp, then just the impeachment from the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0alone after he had gotten out of here was enough to skin him. He could kiss goodbye to his newly appointed Secretary for the Bureau of Evaluations of the Ministry of Revenue position. It was even possible that Hai Liangyi would execute him because of this incident.In this filthy water, Xi Hongxuan carefully ran his hands through his interpersonal network of connections. He did not want to die, nor did he want to be exiled. It had not been easy for him to kick off Xi Gu\u2019an and climb his way to this position, as well as meet such a rare \u201cgood master\u201d like Li Jianheng. He had to live.Hurry up.With his lips turning pale from the loss of blood, Xi Hongxuan silently said to himself.Xue Xiuzhuo, Hai Liangyi, Shen Zechuan, and even Xiao Chiye. Whoever it was, hurry up and take him out of here. Li Jianheng must not die here. If he were to die here, all he had done in the past would go down the drain.Just as Xi Hongxuan was about to close his eyes, a loud rumble suddenly rang out above them. Following right after, the broken wall debris tumbled down noisily. The stinky water also came pouring in as various voices mingled in the heavy rain.Xi Hongxuan almost wept with joy. He heard Li Jianheng being hoisted up. Then, under the simultaneous shouts of the\u00a0Imperial Army, the heavy weights pinning him down were lifted off him.The stinky water was already up to Xi Hongxuan\u2019s waist. He shifted his arms and shouted, \u201cSave, Save\u2014\u201dXiao Chiye looked down at Xi Hongxuan from above. The heavy rain washed down on him, and Xi Hongxuan suddenly felt a chill rose within him. Even when the water swelled to Xi Hongxuan\u2019s chest, Xiao Chiye still did not look as if he had the intention to pull him out.\u201cXiao\u2019Er\u2026\u201d Xi Hongxuan enunciated his words with hatred. The water swiftly brimmed over his head. He struggled all he could as he choked on foul water and flailed about for survival.By the time Xi Hongxuan was dragged up, he had already been submerged until his entire mouth reeked of sewage. As Xiao Chiye lifted him, he dug his fingers hard into Xiao Chiye\u2019s arms, cutting a sorry sight as he craned his neck and gasped under his breath, \u201cScrew. Your. Mother!\u201dXiao Chiye flipped his hand over to press him down, and Xi Hongxuan clawed at the mud as the sludge filled his mouth and nose. This sense of suffocation made him rake and pull with all his might, but he could not make Xiao Chiye\u2019s iron arms budge even the slightest.Xiao Chiye had the intent to kill, but he could not hold him down to his death for real. The people at the back had yet to withdraw completely, and Li Jianheng had been awake and sober when he was taken out.Xiao Chiye lifted him by the back of his collar and lowered his head to say sinisterly, \u201cSay that to me again.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 : DredgeXi Hongxuan trembled as he puked, his face terrifying pale. Han Jin, who was behind them, saw that the situation did not bode well and hurriedly waded over to stop them. Xiao Chiye released his hands and watched as Xi Hongxuan was lifted into the sedan. The rain was still pouring, and all the major and minor officials were crying as they chased after Li Jianheng\u2019s sedan and swarmed their way back to the palace gates.Pan Xiangjie ran until his shoes fell off. The old man lifted the hem of his robe, panting and not forgetting to cry out \u201cYour Majesty\u201d. Everyone around them was more or less the same. Only Hai Liangyi was as dignified as ever as he followed the sedan the entire way back to the palace.The imperial physicians, who have long been waiting, rushed over to meet them in a fluster, and the chaotic procession continued into the inner palace where a plainly dressed Mu Ru came to receive them. The moment she saw Li Jianheng all covered in blood, her tears began to flow.The Empress Dowager let Hua Xiangyi help her out and said in a hostile tone to Han Cheng, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for you to be anxious, but why did you call a bunch of elder excellencies to run along? All of them are advanced in age, and they have all got caught in the rain. Won\u2019t it exacerbate the situation further if anything were to happen to them?!\u201dThere was a rustle as the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0kneeled. Han Cheng said, \u201cThis humble subject deserves death.\u201d\u201cHurry over and get them to prepare the soup and distribute clothes.\u201d The Empress Dowager then said to the ministers. \u201cIt touches me to see how sincere and loyal everyone is. Now that His Majesty is already back at the palace, there\u2019s no need for any rush at this point in time. The weather is so cold. Everyone, please head to the side hall to seek shelter from the wind and have a bowl of hot soup. Do not fall ill at this juncture.\u201dThe various officials kowtowed to say their thanks.The Empress Dowager said again, \u201cGrand Secretary and the Grand Secretariat, as well as the excellencies of the various bureaus, please come in for a talk.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Cen Yu was not around. He remained at Donglong Street to dredge up the public sewers together with Xiao Chiye. Yu Xiaozai, who was of low official grade, followed behind them and helped Cen Yu to carry the straw raincoat.Xiao Chiye\u2019s head and face were thoroughly drenched in water. The chilly wind blew until everyone all around was trembling, yet he was not the least bit affected. While digging up the two men earlier, he had alone lifted up that weight that was near a hundred\u00a0jin.1\u00a0At present, he was wrapping a handkerchief around the area between his thumb and index finger, with an expression that did not look too good.\u201cIt\u2019s all poverty-stricken households living in the low-lying area. It isn\u2019t easy for them to have a house built out of broken wood to live in. Nine out of ten did not give their agreements when they heard that the houses are going to be demolished.\u201d With his bare feet soaking in the water, Cen Yu lifted the hem of his soaked official robe and tucked it around his waist. He continued, \u201cOnly Donglong Street is flooded today because Donglong Street is right next to Kailing River. If this rain doesn\u2019t stop, Viceroy, then the water level on the other streets will rise tomorrow too.\u201d\u201cIf the imperial court is willing to give those poverty-stricken households whose houses are demolished a subsidy of five taels of silver, then they will all be willing.\u201d Partially covered in mud, Tantai Hu said, \u201cThey just want to have a place to stay. As long as we are willing to subsidize them money, then it won\u2019t be a problem. This humble subject feels that those who obstruct the dredging are the big residences. Each of those residences violated the regulations to expand their lands, and there have been many cases where they come to blows with one another in private. Who would be willing to wreck a perfectly good house for just five taels of silvers now that we are telling them to tear down their houses? They won\u2019t even respond if we knock on their doors!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t come to an agreement regarding the subsidy.\u201d Cen Yu, who had run around in official circles for a long time, was very much aware of the ins and outs of it. He said, \u201cIt is on account of the Grand Secretary Hai that the Ministry of Revenue is willing to take out the money to offer aid reliefs to the disaster victims. This sum of money still has to be separately counted when the time comes. They will never agree if they still have to subsidize each household five taels of silver.\u201d\u201cYour Excellency, don\u2019t hold it against this uncouth fellow for saying something unpleasant, but why are you still thinking about the money at this juncture?!\u201d Tantai Hu\u2019s chest heaved. \u201cAn epidemic might break out once this water rises and people die! At that point, it\u2019d be pointless keeping the silver!\u201d\u201cBrother Hu, don\u2019t get worked up.\u201d Yu Xiaozai raised his hands to soothe everyone. He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a clear idea of this account. The Ministry of Revenue has their own difficulties. They don\u2019t really begrudge this amount. As it nears the inspection, they will have a peace of mind if they can do a wonderful job on this matter. It will make them look good, so they will only be too happy to do it, won\u2019t they? But why are they unwilling? It\u2019s all because they are embarrassingly short of cash! Let\u2019s say they take this sum of money out now to deal with the emergency at hand. In a few more days, it will be the spring plowing farming season in the various lands. There is not a single harvest in the places affected by disasters last year. Based on the localities\u2019 reports, the Ministry of Revenue has to consider allocating money to the localities so that the affected local prefectural\u00a0yamen\u00a0or Provincial Administration Commissioners can use the money to buy seeds from the neighboring provinces with bumper harvests. This is a major issue concerning the meals of hundreds of thousands of people. So how would they dare to act rashly and touch the existing money in the state treasury? Moreover, since these people are expanding their lands against the law, they should be found guilty and punished according to the law if the matter of illegal occupation of the public ditches was to be investigated and pursued. The imperial court has not even punished them, so how can they dig into the coffers to give them money instead? If they don\u2019t run through this matter clearly, then our\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0will have to impeach their Ministry of Revenue in the future. That\u2019s why everyone is in a spot.\u201dYu Xiaozai had the ability to calm people down. When those slightly accented words left his mouth, even the most major of issues could wait. What he said was the truth, not because he was taking sides with anyone. The problem was precisely what he had said.The localities\u2019 plowing and planting season in spring directly concerned Dazhou\u2019s course of action this year. The army provisions of two major strategic frontier lands depended on the grain harvests of Juexi\u2019s thirteen cities and Hezhou\u2019s frontline. So no one dared to be slipshod. This was their number one priority.What could they do?Forcibly going ahead with the demolition would rouse public wrath. Half of the men from the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0were currently from military households in\u00a0Qudu. There weren\u2019t many of them who lived in Donglong Street, but there weren\u2019t just a few either. When Hai Liangyi entrusted this matter to the\u00a0Imperial Army, he was, in fact, entrusting it to Xiao Chiye. Because once this matter was handed over to the Eight Great Training Divisions, then there would be no consideration of any compromise. Han Jin would directly call for the place to be leveled outright. But there was no way they could simply overlook the potential danger that could arise as a result of this.He had meant for Xiao Chiye to think of a way.Xiao Chiye bandaged the area between his thumb and index finger tightly. Just as he was about to speak, he saw a man walking over in the rain.Shen Zechuan cupped his hands in greeting to them and said, \u201cJust as I\u2019ve guessed. All the gentlemen are here. How\u2019s the progress for the public ditches?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a tough one to deal with.\u201d Cen Yu let out a long sigh. \u201cWe can\u2019t very well just tear them down.\u201d\u201cUltimately, what makes it hard for the Ministry of Revenue is that they can\u2019t figure out the expense quota for the upcoming spring plow.\u201d Although Shen Zechuan looked calm, his cheeks were tinged with red. He looked at the rain and said, \u201cThis account can actually be estimated. This untalented one has seen the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019 records archives, so I have some insights regarding it. Would the Viceroy mind hearing what I have to say?\u201dXiao Chiye stared at him and said, \u201cJudge, please go ahead and voice it.\u201dShen Zechuan thought for a moment, then said, \u201cLast year, when the new emperor ascended the throne, there was general amnesty granted to various lands. Consequently, Juexi was exempted from 30% taxes. They had a bumper year last year. Other than Huaizhou and Dunzhou of Zhongbo, both of which reported damages caused by disasters, the others all had no problem. Viceroy, Dunzhou is hard-pressed for food this year. The prefectural\u00a0yamen\u00a0will definitely have to buy grains from Cizhou, whose granaries are filled to the brim. There was heavy snow at the start of the year, with the snow in Zhongbo blanketing all the houses. Didn\u2019t the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0set aside 40,000 taels from Libei Armored Cavalry\u2019s military funds this year for Cizhou so that they would have enough for aid relief? You can get Cizhou to repay this favor now. Ask the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0to send a letter to Cizhou\u2019s Prefectural Prefect, Zhou Gui, and get him to give a rebate for the grains he sells to Dunzhou based on that 40,000 taels. That way, the Ministry of Revenue will be able to save on their allocation of funds to Cizhou and use that money for the current house demolition subsidies.\u201dYu Xiaozai pondered over it again and said, \u201cBut the matter of illegally occupying public ditches is still a crime if it were to be pursued further. The Ministry of Revenue can\u2019t do it, right?\u201d\u201cThe illegal occupation of public ditches is indeed punishable by the law. But special times require special treatment. We can\u2019t just follow the set rules and apply the same old rigid rules to the situation every time.\u201d Shen Zechuan paused for a moment. \u201cThe imperial court can\u2019t meet the disaster victims. So this subsidy is a kindness, an act of imperial magnanimity. It\u2019s most appropriate for His Excellency Cen to be the one to step forth and discuss this matter. The Ministry of Revenue is really not that hard-hearted either. As long as it isn\u2019t wrong, the account is clear, and the money is sufficient, they are sure to proceed right at once.\u201dThe inspection was just around the corner, and the assessments and evaluations were related to the promotion of personnel from the various bureaus. Everyone would be more than willing to get an \u201coutstanding\u201d. So, as long as it was reasonable enough, they would certainly be willing to do it.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about Cizhou again.\u201d Shen Zechuan looked at Xiao Chiye. \u201cZhongbo wants to construct the former city this year. Although we still don\u2019t know which excellency will be assigned, it is still going to be an expense to deploy manpower when the time comes. The Viceroy is in Cizhou\u2019s favor because of the matter this time. When the time to construct the former city, you can tag that manpower expenditure on those whose houses were demolished today, and let the various households allocate manpower to Cizhou for about a month or so to provide manual labor with the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0escorting them. It can also be considered a punishment for illegally occupying the public ditches. These five taels of silver won\u2019t be delayed or owed; the ones issuing them and the ones receiving them can all do so with a peace of mind.\u201dNot only that, with this matter, Cizhou would also shift from being indebted to Libei to a relationship of mutual help and assistance. As long as Zhou Gui was not a fool, he would understand this to be an opportunity to make friends.As soon as the words left Shen Zechuan\u2019s mouth, Yu Xiaozai shook open the straw raincoat and draped it over Cen Yu.Cen Yu was going to do it right away. He strode forward and patted Shen Zechuan\u2019s shoulder heavily and said, \u201cYour Excellency the Judge, time is pressing, so I won\u2019t say more. Once this is over, I, Cen Yu, shall prepare some simple meal with wine in my humble abode and respectfully await your visit!\u201dHe put on his bamboo hat and left with Yu Xiaozai.\u201cHow is it going in the palace?\u201d Xiao Chiye grasped hold of Shen Zechuan\u2019s wrists.Tantai Hu made as if to speak, but stopped and said nothing.Shen Zechuan backhandedly hooked the waist token on his waist and looked at it for a moment before saying, \u201cThe Empress Dowager has summoned the top ministers of the various bureaus, ready to settle accounts with them. It\u2019s just as well you aren\u2019t among them. The public ditches have to be dredged as soon as possible. There are some remarks made out of courtesy earlier. But you have to understand that if you still don\u2019t unclog the ditches these few days, then you will be called to account.\u201dIt was inappropriate for Xiao Chiye to touch Shen Zechuan again as both men stood at this spot. But when he saw Shen Zechuan getting doused with the rainwater until he looked visibly sick, he said, \u201cThe Secretariat Elder told you to keep a watch in the palace, so go back. You just need to sit in the office to drink a cup of hot tea with your eyes on the door.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s Han Cheng\u2019s job.\u201d Shen Zechuan turned his head. \u201c\u2026 It worries me that\u00a0shifu\u00a0is at Zhao Zui Temple. There\u2019s no time to lose. Go about your work first. I have to follow the men from the Ministry of Revenue and handle the aid reliefs for the disaster victims behind the scenes.\u201dXiao Chiye still wanted to say something, but Han Jin, at the other end, was already lifting his shoes and calling out to him. So Xiao Chiye could only release his hands and retreated a few steps to turn around and leave with Tantai Hu and Chen Yang in tow.Shen Zechuan had a splitting headache, although the pouring rain cleared up his mind a little. He turned around to call out to Ge Qingqing and brought him towards the low-lying area.Dredging the public ditches was not an easy task. The work was dirty and tiring. The men from the Ministry of Revenue even had to change their shoes and lift their robes when they went into the water. Those on the job were all cowering under the awning, not even wanting to get wet. In any case, this was a task Hai Liangyi gave to the Ministry of Works and the\u00a0Imperial Army. They were merely here to assist.When Shen Zechuan arrived, he saw that there were not even enough of those gathered to count with all his ten fingers. He knew that those at the bottom ladder of the Ministry of Revenue who were used to muddle along were the most slippery; unless they had something to gain, they could not be ordered about.Ge Qingqing asked, \u201cIt\u2019s about to be dark soon. Why are there so few people?\u201dFawning and bowing to Shen Zechuan in subservience, the official invited him for a seat and said, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get them all here. The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0ahead of us didn\u2019t finish digging, did they? It\u2019s not too late to call for more people tomorrow morning once they are done digging tonight. No rush. Your Excellency, come and sit! Look at how soaked you are! Have this cup of hot tea. At least warm yourself up. Don\u2019t let yourself get frozen!\u201dShen Zechuan did not move. He looked at the awning and smiled, \u201cDid you set this up yourself? Good job.\u201dThat official held out the tea and grinned from ear to ear, \u201cOf course! Everyone has been so busy; who\u2019d be worrying about us? We could only build it ourselves\u2026\u201dHis voice trailed off. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0stood solemnly behind Shen Zechuan and watched him without so much a smile.Shen Zechuan wasn\u2019t too bad as he received the tea and took a sip.The official toadied up to him. \u201cThis is fine tea from Hezhou, especially steeped for Your Excellency\u2014\u201dShen Zechuan flipped his wrist and splashed the tea all over his face. The official yelled in shock and backed off. Shen Zechuan tapped on the bottom of the upside-down teacup with his fingertips and cleared the cup of the tea leaves, all the while with the smile still on his face. Amidst the downpour, his smiling face was even more luscious and pleasing to the eyes.\u201cAs for this tea\u2026\u201d Shen Zechuan spoke gently, \u201cConsider it a toast from me to you. Why didn\u2019t you drink it?\u201dThe official hastily wiped the tea leaves off his face in a fluster and said, \u201cT-too quick\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen the King of Hell calls for you, it won\u2019t do for you not to respond quickly.\u201d Throwing aside the teacup, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cThe Grand Secretary gave strict orders to the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0to supervise and oversee the matter of aid relief. I reckon the order of immediate execution hanging around your neck isn\u2019t as tight as we\u2019d like. You must drink up all this tea that I\u2019ve splashed on the ground. Since you can\u2019t receive it standing, allow me to send you on your way so you can finish the drink when you\u2019re six feet under.\u201dThe official kneeled to the floor in a panic and said, \u201cY-Your Excellency, how can you do this?! At any rate, this humble subordinate is a sixth-grade official of the imperial court. H-how can you execute as you please\u2026\u201d\u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Prison\u00a0has never taken in anyone below fourth-grade!\u201d Ge Qingqing lifted the hem of his robe and kicked him into the water puddle. \u201cIf the Judge has ordered you to drink, then drink you must. You can decide whether you\u2019d like to drink it alive, or drink it in the underworld when you are dead.\u201dThe official rolled into the water. Seeing Shen Zechuan staring at him with his hand on his blade, he immediately cupped the water in his hands and stuffed it into his mouth, crying, \u201cI will drink it! I will drink it!\u201dThe surrounding men standing and sitting in various postures jesting and clowning around all quietly stood to stand well-mannerly at the side.Shen Zechuan swept a glance at them and said, \u201cCan this task be done immediately?\u201dEveryone answered in unison, \u201cWe are at Your Excellency the Judge\u2019s disposal.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just a mere supervisor and inspector; what would I know about the ins and outs of things?\u201d Shen Zechuan took out the blue handkerchief to wipe his hands and said with a smile, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare to put the various gentlemen at my disposal. Us\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0will just follow you gentlemen. So, shall we go?\u201dWho would still dare to remain behind?!That official trembled as he tried to come up as well. Shen Zechuan glanced at him, and he retreated and stammered, \u201cYour, Your Excellency\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re on this street.\u201d Shen Zechuan said soothingly before leaving, \u201cDrink it all up before you come over.\u201dThe sky had already completely darkened, but the rain still showed no signs of stopping. No matter how imposing and awe-inspiring the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0were, they also had to enter the water and soak in it until they reeked all over. Feeling the world spinning when he got up, Shen Zechuan braced himself with a hand on a public ditch plank and composed himself for a moment. Everyone around him was busying around, so no one noticed it.Only Ge Qingqing hurriedly tried to persuade him in a whisper, \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry for now. It\u2019s fine to rest for a moment!\u201dShen Zechuan forced a smile, feeling as if he must not open his mouth; the taste of nausea was already pushing up against his throat. Bracing himself against the plank, he went up and felt around for a water bag under the partially collapsed humble abode.There was a sudden weight on his back as someone covered up Shen Zechuan\u2019s head. Shen Zechuan was still crouching, and the obstruction before him was lifted once again. Xiao Chiye gasped for breath as he suddenly burrowed his way in and stuffed the still warm lunchbox to him. The next moment, he burrowed his way out and lifted his foot to leave.Shen Zechuan pushed aside the overcoat that was covering his head. That man who had already taken a few steps away returned the way he came. He stepped on the collapsed debris and crouched down to cup Shen Zechuan\u2019s face in his palms, then kissed him hard. After he was done kissing, he rubbed Shen Zechuan\u2019s cheeks vigorously.Rainwater poured noisily. Xiao Chiye was panting hard. He looked at Shen Zechuan under the dimness for a split second. Without saying a word, he turned and ran. He flipped over with agility and vigor, putting on the dirty, wet robe hanging over the crook of his arm again as he sped off into the alley.If it weren\u2019t for time constraints.Xiao Chiye tugged at his collars as he made his way across the ruins. Stepping on the filth as he hurried over to where the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0was, he cursed\u2014Damn it!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 : Barrage of RainThe overcoat was too big, and it slid down along his shoulders. Shen Zechuan scooped it up. That warmth enveloped him as his entire being soaked in Xiao Chiye\u2019s scent.Shen Zechuan fished out the handkerchief again to wipe the cheeks that Xiao Chiye had made wet with his rubs. On this noisy, rainy night, he could not help but sniff at that handkerchief again.It was all Xiao Chiye\u2019s scent.Shen Zechuan lowered his eyes for a moment and nuzzled the handkerchief with the tip of his nose as the gloom at the corners of his eyes and tips of his eyebrows dissipated.The upper tier of that lunchbox was filled with steamed twisted rolls, while the bottom contained hot medicinal decoction. Hot steam rose the instant the lid was lifted. It was not easy to make a hot meal on this night. Even Xiao Chiye would have to run like mad to rush his way here before hurrying back.Ge Qingqing initially wanted to pour a cup of tea for Shen Zechuan. When he climbed his way up to see the latter drinking the medicine, he could not help but feel stunned before he said in delight, \u201cSo you have it all arranged. That\u2019s great. I was just thinking of sending someone to buy a bowl of medicine.\u201dShen Zechuan downed the medicine and wiped the corners of his lips with his fingers. He asked, \u201cTo what end has this street been torn down?\u201d\u201cJust past Ouhua Pavilion. It\u2019s hard to tear down areas where the collapse is severe.\u201d Ge Qingqing rolled up his sleeves and said, \u201cThere\u2019s something fishy about this matter.\u201d\u201cAnother unexplainable account.\u201d Shen Zechuan sat up and composed himself for a moment before continuing, \u201cOnly His Majesty himself knows who the one who sent him out of the palace is. If he refuses to say, then this case is a dead end.\u201d\u201cAs I see it, this collapse is not a coincidence. Donglong Street gets submerged every year, yet Ouhua Pavilion just had to collapse last night.\u201d Ge Qingqing watched the rainy night, then looked at Shen Zechuan. \u201cDo you have any inkling?\u201dShen Zechuan had been thinking about this matter since this morning. The collapse had wiped out all traces in Ouhua Pavilion, and this was, by no means, a coincidence. Xi Hongxuan was a man who treasured his life. He had only just renovated Ouhua Pavilion some time back, and those who knew about the hollowed-out bottom were few and far between.Shen Zechuan\u2019s widened eyes looked out into the rainy night. As if saying to himself, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to fret. There\u2019s bound to be a follow-up move. We still don\u2019t know who the target is this time.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8The imperial physician retreated from the bedchamber and paid his obeisances to the Empress Dowager and the others. From where she was behind the hanging curtain separating them, the Empress Dowager leaned forward to inquire about Li Jianheng\u2019s condition. The imperial physician gave his report in detail. It was only when she heard that the bleeding had stopped that she felt relieved.\u201cThis matter is bizarre.\u201d The Empress Dowager straightened up in her seat and said, \u201cTo think not a single person knew when the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u00a0had left the palace and headed out. How can anyone rest reassured given the state of patrols within and outside the palace now?\u201dNone of the old ministers below uttered a word. All of them hung their heads in silence, like clay sculptures.The Empress Dowager said, \u201cI\u2019m a member of the imperial harem. I\u2019m not supposed to interfere in governmental affairs. But this, once again, concerns His Majesty\u2019s safety. As his mother, I\u2019m truly worriedly watching with my hair all gray and tears all ran dry.1\u00a0How can I take another scare like this? Excellencies, you ought to give me an explanation this time!\u201dOn hearing this, Pan Xiangjie\u2019s heart clenched.After a moment of silence, Kong Qiu said, \u201cThe patrols in the inner palace might not necessarily be able to stop His Majesty even if they want to. In this subject\u2019s opinion, Xi Hongxuan should be severely punished this time! If he had not used those temptresses from foreign lands to lure His Majesty, then why would His Majesty leave the palace?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d The Minister of Revenue, Wei Huaigu, was the elder\u00a0di\u00a0brother2\u00a0of Wei Huaixing, who had denounced Xiao Chiye before. Wei Huaigu was the current head of the Wei Clan. He usually did not have the habit of speaking out, but this time, he said, \u201cXi Hongxuan deserves to be punished, but his crime does not merit the punishment of death. This subject feels that it\u2019s the Ministry of Works the blame should fall on this time. They are the ones in charge of the repairs in\u00a0Qudu. Your Excellency Pan, how could you let the public ditches get clogged to such an extent?\u201dKnowing that Wei Huaigu was about to shift the blame, Pan Xiangjie immediately fell to his knees and said to the Empress Dowager, \u201cI ask of Your Majesties to discern the truth and render fair\u00a0 judgment! Our Ministry of Works has already notified the Ministry of Revenue regarding the blockage of the public ditches during Emperor Xiande\u2019s reign, hoping that they can allocate some money for us to carry out repair works. But the Ministry of Revenue kept delaying the approval of funds. What can the Ministry of Works do? This is not a minor construction work!\u201dWei Huaigu was in no hurry. He was even more of a tough nut to deal with than Wei Huaixing. He merely said, \u201cOur Ministry of Revenue has to discuss it with the Grand Secretariat in order for the funds to be moved. At that time, approval has yet to go through Secretariat Elder Hua, so who would dare to allocate the funds indiscriminately?\u00a0Qudu\u00a0has to clean up the mess in the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo during those few years. The treasury is almost emptied out. Even if we have the intention to help, we do not have the means.\u201d\u201cEveryone has their difficulties.\u201d Pang Xiangjie said, \u201cSo why are you only holding our Ministry of Works responsible? Left Censor-in-chief, Cen Xunyi, wants to impeach the Ministry of Works for negligence in irrigation works, saying that we failed to secure the embankment of the Kailing River. But did it collapse today? No! This shows that the Ministry of Works has never cut corners; we are dependable and diligent when it comes to our work! If we had the money, we would have long cleared out the public ditches!\u201dThe Ministry of Revenue would not acknowledge this debt, and the Ministry of Works would not shoulder this blame. Both parties were elders of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans. Neither of them was willing to take a step back, and so they both simply stood here and passed the buck around.Kong Qiu almost wanted to sneer. He was from a humble background, and an official that Hai Liangyi himself had lifted to this position. He could work together with the ministers from the noble clans, but he could not be of the same mind with them. Now that he was hearing them kicking the ball around, he felt vexed and fed up.It was true that the Ministry of Works had made a report before. But who was the one who reported it? It was a subordinate, a minor official, who had never set foot into the court. Did Pan Xiangjie take it seriously? If he did, he would have taken it up with the Ministry of Revenue himself, but he did not. Did the Ministry of Revenue know? They did. What was the relationship between Wei Huaigu and Hua Siqian? Both clans could be considered in-laws. Although they did not seem to be on close terms in recent years, the ties still existed. Wei Huaigu was far more resourceful than Wei Huaixing, and he was the one who could discuss political affairs with Hua Siqian. But he had never really talked to Hua Siqian about this matter. This was a matter they simply muddled their way through\u2014If you drowned, then you deserved it; you could only blame your own bad luck!Sitting behind the curtain, the Empress Dowager saw through these people clearly. Hua Xiangyi stood behind her, listening with rapt attention.Hai Liangyi finally coughed a few times. Covering his mouth with a handkerchief, he said, \u201cThere was indeed this one account in the Grand Secretariat\u2019s past reported accounts. But it was only once, and no one bothered to ask about it afterward. Now that the place has collapsed, everyone remembers it, but is this year the first time the water level rose? Let\u2019s not bring up what happened way back, but did the water level rise during spring last year and the year before last? Did the Ministry of Works report those rises?\u201dPan Xiangjie turned his head away and said remorsefully, \u201cWhen the Grand Secretary puts it that way\u2026 it\u2019s indeed an oversight on our Ministry of Works\u2019 part. But it really can\u2019t be helped. What\u2019s of essence now is to dredge up the ditches without delay.\u201d\u201cThe Ministry of Revenue has also allocated the money to the disaster victims.\u201d Wei Huaigu said. \u201cThe situation is critical at present. The appropriation of blame can wait until the public ditches have been dredged. Is the Eight Great Training Divisions the ones digging right now?\u201dThe Minister of War, Chen Zhenyan, replied succinctly, \u201cIt\u2019s the\u00a0Imperial Army. Viceroy Xiao is still soaking in the water.\u201dThe Empress Dowager was about to speak up when the palace maid inside hurriedly rushed out and fell to her knees on the ground. She said, \u201cTo report to Your Majesty, His Majesty has suddenly developed a fever. His back is covered all over in rashes!\u201dThe Empress Dowager suddenly rose to her feet and exclaimed in shock, \u201cWhat?\u201dHai Liangyi bent over and started to cough violently. Hua Xiangyi held the Empress Dowager to support her and promptly made a decision. \u201cSummon the imperial physician! And support the Secretariat Elder, quick!\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xi Hongxuan had broken out into rashes too. The one who discovered it first was the military medic of the Eight Great Training Divisions. He promptly lifted the hem of his robe and hurried out to report to Han Jin.Han Jin wiped his face, still feeling a little dumbfounded as he said, \u201cIs it eczema? Just dispel the cold and it\u2019ll be fine?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not eczema.\u201d The medic was so anxious that he stomped his foot. \u201cHow is that eczema? It\u2019s an epidemic disease!\u201dNow, it was not just Han Jin whose expression changed; the surrounding Eight Great Training Divisions\u2019 soldiers who were still in the water had all gone pale. Han Jin turned his head back and saw the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0still busying around a short distance away. He waded through the water to them and grasped hold of Chen Yang to yell, \u201cWhere is the Viceroy? Call the Viceroy over quickly. It\u2019s a matter of urgency!\u201dXiao Chiye pushed away the broken plank and walked over, asking, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dHan Jin\u2019s hands trembled as he smeared the dirty water on his clothes and said, \u201cWe can\u2019t pull them down anymore or soak in this water either! Viceroy, an epidemic has broken out!\u201dThere was a cold glint in Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes as he asked, \u201cWho got it first?\u201d\u201cXi Hongxuan.\u201d Han Jin\u2019s breathing was hurried. \u201cIs His, His Majesty\u2026\u201d\u201cGu Jin!\u201d Xiao Chiye immediately commanded. \u201cRush to the palace and report this matter to Secretariat Elder Hai!\u201dGu Jin climbed up the bank and sped off. In a few steps, he somersaulted to the rooftop and stepped across the ridge of the roof to leap his way to the palace gates.\u201cTake me to see Xi Hongxuan.\u201d Xiao Chiye said in a steady voice. \u201cNow!\u201dXi Hongxuan was feverish and hot all over. Medicine had only just been applied to his crushed legs, and now his legs were already drenched in sweat. He lay on the bed, delirious and incoherent.The medic wiped his sweat and said, \u201cFour hours earlier, he still looked as if he had caught a little cold. I fed him medicine, and his fever subsided. But who knew that when I touched him earlier, his fever was back with even more of a vengeance! When I changed the medicine for his legs and pulled down his pants for a look, it was all covered in rashes!\u201dXiao Chiye looked at those rashes and questioned, \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s an epidemic disease?\u201dThe medic said, \u201cDuring the reign of Yongyi, an epidemic like this had broken out in the City of Dancheng. It was reported to the Imperial Academy of Medicine; they have past records of it on file. Viceroy, once this rash spreads all over the body, the high fever will not subside. In another four hours, the infected will fall unconscious and keep vomiting. I\u2019m afraid there are still sick people among the disaster victims. Without losing any time, Zhao Zui Temple must arrange for the decoction of the relevant herbs as a precaution!\u201dAfraid now, Han Jin hastily asked, \u201cWhat caused this? There has to be a reason. Otherwise, how are we going to continue digging this ditch?\u201dThe medic said, \u201cWe\u2019re now at the point when winter transits into spring. It\u2019s damp and cold. The low-lying area gathers sewage and filth throughout the year. Their houses are closely clustered together; it\u2019s so cramped that there\u2019s not even a window. The lack of sunlight will make the people prone to illnesses.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then how did he get infected?\u201d Xiao Chiye furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cOuhua Pavilion is far from the low-lying area, and there are people cleaning the connected alleys at the back, so there\u2019s no contact with contaminated objects. Is the reason just because he soaked in the swill water those few hours during the collapse?\u201dThe medic hesitated. He wiped his sweat again and mustered out the courage to say, \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with the Viceroy. I\u2019m afraid he did not contract this illness during the collapse, but when he was fooling around in the brothel before the collapse. Second Young Master Xi is already burning up to such an extent, then His Majesty\u2014\u201d\u201cViceroy!\u201d Meng Rui lifted the curtain and entered with a solemn expression. \u201cOver ten people have suddenly collapsed at Zhao Zui Temple. Two men from the Ministry of Revenue who are here on duty have collapsed too!\u201dXiao Chiye was about to give his command when Chen Yang, all drenched in rainwater, barged in and said, \u201cMaster!\u00a0Laohu\u00a0is also down with a fever!\u201dThe sound of the rain outside suddenly grew urgent. Like battle drums sounding on all sides, they came pounding down for all they were worth, as if they wanted to shatter this pitch-black night.Xiao Chiye abruptly lifted the curtain and stepped out. He said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be too late to wait for the approval. Head over to the various major medicinal stores on Shenwu Street to get the medicine. Help anyone who caught a cold, has a fever, is vomiting, or is physically weak to Zhao Zui Temple. Withdraw the rest of the men. Get the men on duty from the Ministry of Revenue to start decocting the herbal medicine! Ding Tao!\u201dDing Tao said, \u201cYoung Master!\u201dXiao Chiye tugged Ding Tao over, breathing heavily in the rain as he whispered, \u201cTell Shen Lanzhou to leave immediately!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 : EpidemicRaindrops bounced all over, while splotches of mud spattered.People hurried in and out of Zhao Zui Temple. The awning to provide shelter from the rain had already been erected, and the strong, bitter aroma of the herbal decoction pervaded the air everywhere. Even the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0keeping an eye on the stoves were covering their noses and mouths with handkerchiefs.With a cloth wrapped around his head, Qi Huilian distributed the medicinal decoction together with Ji Gang. Seeing the feverish man who had fallen unconscious vaguely mumbling some words, he scrutinized him for a moment.Ji Gang was clearing the bowls with nimble movements, but when he saw an unmoving Grand Mentor, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cThis is the Dancheng epidemic disease.\u201d Qi Huilian pushed apart the patient\u2019s collars. \u201cThe rashes will spread over his body. We cannot get close to him. It\u2019s contagious.\u201dJi Gang asked, \u201cCan it be treated?\u201dQi Huilian\u2019s scalp itched. He scratched it a few times and said, \u201cYes, but it\u2019s troublesome. The public ditches must continue to be dug, but who knows if any of the infected have spat or pissed in the water? If the diggers were to get infected without realizing it and come into contact with the others, then wouldn\u2019t another bunch of them topple over ill?\u201d\u201cSuch a sin.\u201d Ji Gang looked beneath the rain shelter awning. \u201cWhat should be done then?\u201d\u201cWhat should be done\u2026\u201d Qi Huilian suddenly pulled up the cloth to cover his face as he looked at Zhao Zui Temple\u2019s entrance where some people had come. He whispered, \u201cIt all depends on fate. First of all, the public has to be reassured; there\u2019s no room for unrest. Then, assemble all the big and small medicinal stores in\u00a0Qudu. The infected have to be quarantined and isolated.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t stay for long too.\u201d Ji Gang put the bowl down. \u201cThere\u2019ll be someone handling this matter. I\u2019ll ask Chuan-er to leave.\u201d\u201cLanzhou can\u2019t leave.\u201d Qi Huilian said. \u201cHe\u2019s the one handling this matter. At such a juncture, can you count on Han Cheng to step forward and handle this? All of them can hardly wait to hide and dodge this bullet.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Ji Gang turned pale. \u201cHe\u2019s only just a fifth-grade Judge now. He doesn\u2019t even have the qualifications of a fourth-grade to attend court. So how can they let him do it? This is a major issue. There are plenty of higher-ranking people with more authority and power than him!\u201d\u201cWho are you reasoning with?\u201d Qi Huilian put down the bowls. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do if Han Cheng keeps him here in the name of gaining experience! Once the disease starts spreading, which high-ranking official would be willing to come down here? Even Hai Liangyi won\u2019t be able to come! Besides, Lanzhou can\u2019t leave. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. If he succeeds, he can get promoted again! A promo\u2014\u201dJi Gang shoved him away abruptly and said, \u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting?!\u201dQi Huilian fell to the ground and climbed back to his feet. He said, \u201cWhat are you still waiting for if you don\u2019t seize the opportunity to act now?!\u201d His temper flared too. \u201cThis is the time when people trample over one another for personal gain. He has to do it no matter what! Do you understand?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care to understand.\u201d Ji Gang flushed with rage. \u201cI\u2019m telling him to leave. I have to take him away!\u201dAfter saying that, Ji Gang moved to head inside. Qiao Tianya walked out towards him and blocked his path.\u201cThose in Zhao Zui Temple will be evacuated out. Only infected patients can remain inside.\u00a0Shifu, don\u2019t go in again.\u201d Qiao Tianya said with a smile. \u201cTeacher\u2019s journals and notes have already been shifted to the old residence. Master told me to rent a small building on Shenwu Street for both of you. It\u2019s close to the palace gates, so there\u2019s no way it can get flooded.\u201d\u201cMove aside!\u201d Ji Gang said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the infected inside, so how can Chuan-er stay for long? I have to talk to him!\u201dQiao Tianya reined in his smile and said with a stern countenance, \u201cShifu, why put me in a spot? Since Master has already given the instructions, then there\u2019s absolutely no reason to change it. It\u2019s all the infected here. Master will worry if you remain here. Please come with me on account of his filial piety.\u201dHearing the sound of intense coughing all around, Ji Gang grew even more anxious. He grabbed Qiao Tianya\u2019s arms and pushed it back. Qiao Tianya had already anticipated that he would make a move, so he promptly took the blow. Half of his arm had gone numb, but his legs were faster as he moved to block Ji Gang with his entire body.\u201cShifu!\u201d Qiao Tianya said in hushed tones, \u201cCalm down! For Master to make such an arrangement, he would naturally already have a countermeasure in mind. I still have to return here later. Let us leave earlier, and Master can go back earlier too, alright? There are so many pairs of eyes watching. Do you think you can really take him away? Where can you go?\u201dThis \u201cwhere can you go\u201d calmed Ji Gang down. He looked at the interior for a long time, then flicked his sleeves and trembled as he pointed at Qi Huilian. But in the end, he said not another word more.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan sat on the bench and closed his eyes to rest. His ears had been buzzing, and he was presently feeling dizzy. Yet his face betrayed none of his discomfort. It was only after a while when he heard someone calling him that he opened his eyes. There was not a single trace of weariness the instant he opened his eyes.The official from the Ministry of Revenue said, \u201cYour Excellency the Judge, the supply of herbs isn\u2019t sufficient. What are we going to do tomorrow?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of grave importance. There won\u2019t be a break in the supply of herbs.\u201d Shen Zechuan gathered the overcoat around him. \u201cThe imperial physician from the Imperial Academy of Medicine ought to be here already. When the time comes, he will bring news of the prepared herbs over as well. Tell them to continue decocting the medicine. Don\u2019t scrimp on the herbs.\u201dThat official uttered an acknowledgment in response.Seeing his panic-stricken expression, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cWhich section of the Ministry of Revenue are you an official of?\u201dThe official hurriedly said, \u201cThis humble subordinate is not really an official per se, but merely a minor official in charge of the records of official documents.\u201d\u201cWe are all working for the people. It\u2019s all the same whether you are a major or minor official.\u201d As Shen Zechuan spoke, he extended his hand and pinched the center of his eyebrows. He composed himself for a moment before he continued with a question, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cThis humble subordinate\u2019s name is Liang Cuishan.\u201d\u201cYou will take over the supervision of the herbs tomorrow morning. No matter how big or small, make a detailed record of them.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cMy guess is that the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0has already gone to transfer the herbs. Time is tight. We most certainly can\u2019t wait for the palace\u2019s memo, so the herbs these few days must all be clearly recorded.\u201dHe suddenly stopped and paused for a moment.\u201cGo and rest for now. Pay attention to your health these few days. Report it immediately if you feel any discomfort.\u201dLiang Cuishan took his leave. The moment the curtain fell back down, Shen Zechuan felt his forehead, which was scalding hot.Ge Qingqing came in right after. Shocked at the sight, he stepped forward and whispered, \u201cJudge\u2026\u201dShen Zechuan asked with calm, \u201cWhen did Xi Hongxuan get the rashes?\u201d\u201cFour hours after the medicine was applied.\u201d Ge Qingqing said. \u201cThe rashes started spreading up from his legs.\u201d\u201cFor me, I got the rashes first before the fever.\u201d Shen Zechuan said with a clear head. \u201cThe symptoms don\u2019t match, so it\u2019s probably not an epidemic disease. But as a precaution, I\u2019ll drink that medicine too.\u201dGe Qingqing felt a little more relieved. He said, \u201cFortunately, you did not take leave this morning!\u201dThe Emperor had been infected with the epidemic disease. Which imperial physician would dare to say he got it while he was out fooling around? They could only find an excuse to fob everyone else off, saying that he got infected out of carelessness. But who could infect the Emperor with the disease? If not his personal eunuchs, then it was the guards who often moved around the Emperor. Shen Zechuan was, at present, officially tasked to act in the Emperor\u2019s presence. Supposed he had taken leave this morning, and someone got a handle against him after the fact and made his eczema out to be rashes from the epidemic disease, then he would lose the right to remain before the Emperor. Shen Zechuan still carried the burden of Shen Wei\u2019s crime on his back. Once he went down, it would really be hard for him to rise again.Even Shen Zechuan himself would find it hard to breathe at this moment. Compared to schemes and intrigues, this kind of unpredictable providence was hard to guard against. If he had not been so cautious, he would have already fallen into someone else\u2019s grasp right now. His life and death would then be at the mercy of just one utterance.Seeing Shen Zechuan close his eyes, Ge Qingqing withdrew.Shen Zechuan listened to the sound of the rain, but his thoughts had already drifted far away. Those murky old memories followed right on the heels of the sound of rain. He furrowed his brows amid his vexation and weariness.He did not like snowy days, nor did he like rainy days. The cold and wetness would remind him of the Chashi sinkhole, of Ji Mu, of all the days he had been on his knees at the mercy of another. In addition, the cold and wetness would make him uneasy, and make him gloomy. It would make him into nothing more than a fleshy vessel that was all chilling forbearance and irritability within.Just like this, Shen Zechuan leaned against the wall and dozed off for a moment. But the more he dozed, the more drowsy he became, until he fell asleep for real in this corner.It was already late when Xiao Chiye arrived at Zhao Zui Temple. He entered Zhao Zui Temple together with the imperial physician who had hurried over. Behind him, Ding Tao looked miserable, because he did not manage to find Shen Zechuan and missed the time.Xiao Chiye asked the Imperial Bodyguard who was decocting the medicine, \u201cWhere\u2019s the Judge? I\u2019m looking for him!\u201dThe Imperial Bodyguard, with half of his face covered, handed him a bowl of medicine and said, \u201cNo matter who you are looking for, you have to drink the medicine first. Viceroy, you\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0still has to enter the water. Please be careful and take care!\u201dXiao Chiye choked down the medicine without a word.The Imperial Bodyguard rose and yelled under the rain shelter awning, \u201cQing-ge! Is Qing-ge there? Where\u2019s our Judge? Please notify him and tell him that Viceroy Xiao is looking for him.\u201dGe Qingqing was lying on the bench, sleeping. On hearing this, he swiftly sat up and draped his clothes around him before walking over. When he saw that it was Xiao Chiye, he said, \u201cThe Judge is resting inside\u2026 He hasn\u2019t slept all night. Please take a rest too, Viceroy. The Eight Great Training Divisions said they are going to guard the city gates, so there will be only us digging up the rest of this unfinished ditch tomorrow.\u201d\u201cPhysical work naturally has to be done by someone strong and sturdy.\u201d Xiao Chiye said as he walked. \u201cWatch the door. Don\u2019t let anyone in.\u201dXiao Chiye lifted the curtain and entered. There was no light lit inside. He swept a glance around but did not find the man he was looking for. It was only when he took a few more steps that he saw Shen Zechuan, who was leaning against the wall.Xiao Chiye was dirty, so he removed his outer garment and sat beside Shen Zechuan to pour out the water in his boots. It was cold inside the room. He put on his boots and went out again to borrow a fire from the stove, then re-entered to find a copper basin to start a fire.Shen Zechuan opened his eyes and said, \u201cAre you done digging Donglong Street?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Xiao Chiye stoked the fire. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you sleeping on the bed?\u201d\u201cJust taking a short nap.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cIf I lie down, I won\u2019t be able to get up.\u201dXiao Chiye shifted the basin before the bed and said, \u201cCome sleep on the bed. I\u2019ll call you up later.\u201dShen Zechuan did not stand on ceremony. He lay down, and Xiao Chiye embraced him from behind and pressed his face against his cheek. Shen Zechuan could still hear Xiao Chiye whispering at first, but it grew progressively vague towards the back.It was only when Xiao Chiye heard Shen Zechuan\u2019s breathing deepened a little that he reached out to undo his collars and take a closer look at those red rashes.Not the same as Xi Hongxuan.Xiao Chiye closed up Shen Zechuan\u2019s clothes again and hugged Shen Zechuan until he himself fell asleep.Xiao Chiye slept for an unspecified amount of time until he felt a scalding heat in his arms. He was still dazed when he half-opened his eyes, but once he got a clear look at the man in his embrace, his mind instantly cleared.Shen Zechuan seemed to be on fire. Sweat had already drenched his temples. Xiao Chiye felt him; Shen Zechuan was burning up everywhere.Xiao Chiye abruptly sat up and called out to him, \u201cLanzhou, Lanzhou?\u201dShen Zechuan was dripping with sweat. His brows were tightly furrowed, and his breathing was slightly urgent. Roused half-awake by Xiao Chiye, he said, \u201cQua\u2026 Quarantine\u2026 You can get infected with this disease even if you aren\u2019t near the water.\u201dXiao Chiye wrapped him up in the overcoat and shouted, \u201cChen Yang, summon the imperial physician!\u201dChen Yang, who was leaning against the wall outside taking a nap, jerked awake instantly. He rose and leaped off the steps, then made his way under the rain shelter awning and pulled the imperial physician into the interior.The imperial physician lifted the overcoat open, looked for a moment, then said in an urgent tone, \u201cViceroy, the Judge is infected with the epidemic disease! Seems to me that he caught a cold first\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye grasped the imperial physician\u2019s arm. Staring at the imperial physician, he said in a frosty voice, \u201cThe Judge is what?\u201dPanicking, the imperial physician corrected himself, \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 overworked and overstressed\u2026 that\u2019s why he fell ill\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The Judge fell ill here today.\u201d Xiao Chiye tightened his grip. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t ill prior to this.\u201dThe imperial physician repeatedly said, \u201cRight, right, right\u2026\u201d\u201cAll the medicine in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0is here. I know Your Excellency has the miraculous hands of a healer in the medical field.\u201d Xiao Chiye suddenly softened his tone. \u201cYou can cure him, right?\u201dOn seeing Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes, the imperial physician went weak in the knees. He held on to the edge of the bed for support and nodded in a panic as he said, \u201cI can, I can\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 : Rain CeasedAccess in and out of the imperial palace was strictly forbidden, so the Empress Dowager arranged for Hai Liangyi and the other heavyweight ministers to rest in the Grand Secretariat\u2019s council compound. Everyone inside and outside the palace was in a state of anxiety.The daily cleaning of Li Jianheng\u2019s bedchamber was carried out with extra caution, with those serving eunuchs and palace maids all appointed by the Empress Dowager herself. Every time they entered and exited, they had to wash up and change their clothes. They were not even allowed to go out without permission during their breaks. Mu Ru kept watch by Li Jianheng\u2019s side, not once relying on the servants. She personally taste-tested the decoction and fed it to Li Jianheng herself. Even when she ate or slept, she never left Li Jianheng\u2019s bedchamber.Li Jianheng drifted in and out of consciousness, and subsequently, the Imperial Academy of Medicine was on tenterhooks too. Even when they prescribed and decocted medicine, they were careful. Everyone was already walking on eggshells, ready to lose their lives at any time. An air of dread and gloom hung over them all around. Each of them looked utterly wretched and grieved, as if bereft of their parents.The Imperial Academy of Medicine\u2019s men outside the palace made all the arrangements for the medicinal ingredients in\u00a0Qudu. Other than those already infected, all the disaster victims shifted out from the low-lying area had to take the medicine too. The Ministry of Revenue and\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0assisted with the distribution of aid reliefs. They set up a porridge and medicine shack outside Zhao Zui Temple, where they gave out medicinal decoction and rice porridge every day according to schedule.Han Jin had already pulled out of Donglong Street on the night Xi Hongxuan fell ill. On the pretext of patrolling the various city gates, the Eight Great Training Divisions completely threw the matter of dredging up the public ditches to the\u00a0Imperial Army. But half of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0men had been on standby on Mount Feng awaiting orders, and now, they could not get in at all. Xiao Chiye did not have that many elite soldiers. Fortunately, there were still some people from the Ministry of Works who had yet to be withdrawn. Together with the dozens of\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, everyone pooled manpower and braved the rain to dig through the four main streets.By the fourth day, everyone was exhausted and weak. Chen Yang, Ge Qingqing, Qiao Tianya, and Gu Jin gathered together when they returned and leaned against the wall for a nap. Ding Tao and Xiaowu were young. The various\u00a0gege\u00a0took care of them and took turns to stretch and straighten out their legs for them to use as pillows when they slept. Ding Tao could not lick ink out from his brush, so the note-taking in his little notebook came to a halt. It had only been a few days, and every one of them had taken on the look of a disheveled and unkempt beggar.Xiao Chiye did not sleep much these days. He had to lead men to dig ditches before dawn, and there was no time for rest throughout the day. At night, when he returned to Zhao Zui Temple, he still had to watch over Shen Zechuan.Shen Zechuan was still able to remain awake and clear-headed a few days before, but later on, his fever would not recede, and he had a severe case of vomiting. But without food in his stomach, he could only regurgitate bile. When he was fed medicine, he would puke it all out in the middle of the night. So, when Xiao Chiye returned, he would hug Shen Zechuan. He would lean against the wall and let Shen Zechuan sprawl face-to-face on his chest or shoulder. Each time Shen Zechuan felt like vomiting, he would rub his back.In the dead of night, when all was quiet, Zhao Zui Temple was as lonely as a deserted island beyond the realm of the mundane world. The rain had ceased, and there was nary a sound from the birds as the thick, ink-like night shrouded everything in sight.Shen Zechuan\u2019s breathing was heavy. He suddenly started to cough, his chest heaving violently. Xiao Chiye was jerked awake from his light sleep. He covered Shen Zechuan\u2019s back and tiredly jolted his legs to shake him gently.\u201cLanzhou.\u201d Xiao Chiye coaxed him. \u201cWhere is Lanzhou?\u201dShen Zechuan looked sickly and wan. The nauseating feeling of wanting to vomit was stuck in his throat. He half-opened his eyes and replied in a hoarse voice, \u201cHere\u2026\u201d\u201cGive it a shake, and the illness will dissipate.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cWhen you\u2019ve recovered, this Second Young Master will take you horseback riding.\u201dShen Zechuan rested his head on Xiao Chiye\u2019s shoulder and let out a hoarse \u201chm\u201d in acknowledgment.\u201cThis is actually a position of hugging a child.\u201d Xiao Chiye ran his palm down Shen Zechuan\u2019s back soothingly and, in this moment of intimacy, whispered, \u201cWhen I had a rash before, my mother held me like this. What are you going to call me now that I\u2019m holding you like this today?\u201dShen Zechuan nuzzled his cheeks against Xiao Chiye and buried his face. After a long while, he said in a muffled voice, \u201cCall you daddy.\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s chest shook as he chuckled and asked, \u201cTouched?\u201dShen Zechuan coughed. He did not answer.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cWhen I tamed horses in the past, I ate and slept with them. While\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0was still a foal, we were stranded in the heavy rain. We also snuggled up like this to keep warm then. It has probably already forgotten about this.\u201dShen Zechuan listened in his drowsy state.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget this. If you\u2019re touched, you have to remember this and repay me in the future.\u201dShen Zechuan wanted to say something. He opened his mouth but did not utter a sound. Xiao Chiye reached a finger out to brush away Shen Zechuan\u2019s damp hair and lowered his eyes to look at Shen Zechuan\u2019s pale side profile.\u201cOh, Lanzhou.\u201dXiao Chiye murmured in hushed tones, and it was under these murmurs that Shen Zechuan fell asleep. He lay immersed on the verge of a certain kind of agony and delight, wallowing in torment. And from the bitter depth of his misery, he tasted sweetness.Xiao Chiye was like the blazing sun. He was also like the wind from the grassland. He stood out from the masses. To Shen Zechuan, hiding that handkerchief on that day with the gloomy and damp rain and snow was like hiding a rousing and passionate dream. In this dream, there was the unrestrained galloping of horses over a thousand\u00a0li1\u00a0of grasslands, and the spreading of wings soaring through ten thousand\u00a0li\u00a0of clear sky. These eventually turned into an indescribable glimpse\u2014one he would be hard-pressed to recount in detail.Xiao Chiye was the one who was a kind of temptation. Every word of \u201coh, Lanzhou\u201d he uttered was spoken with deep feeling. Those frivolous cynicism and firm steadfastness of his blended together contradictorily. He was frivolous as he whispered to Shen Zechuan, yet he was also incomparably dependable as he opened his arms to Shen Zechuan.Shen Zechuan was too powerless to resist. Those deep and frivolous kisses deceived him into dropping his guard, until he became a baddie on intimate terms with Xiao Chiye, until he was muddleheaded enough to come to rely on Xiao Chiye amidst this affliction.Shen Zechuan\u2019s vomiting subsided a little later. Xiao Chiye fed him the medicinal decoction little by little. Every time Shen Zechuan showed signs of not waking up from his lethargic sleep, Xiao Chiye would say that phrase \u201cwhere is Lanzhou?\u201d, which seemed to have the inexplicable power to call Shen Zechuan back time and time again.Xiao Chiye originally would still hug Shen Zechuan as he took a nap. But several people died successively one after another in the days after, and he no longer dared to sleep again at night as he listened to Shen Zechuan\u2019s gasps for breath whenever the occasion demanded.On the ninth day, two more people died under the rain shelter awning. They could not just leave the bodies lying around, nor bury them, so Xiao Chiye left them to Ge Qingqing to dispose of.At the time Ge Qingqing led the men to sort out the corpses and carry them out, Qiao Tianya was squatting by the stove fanning the fire. As he watched the medicine, he went through some matters in his mind.\u201cThe Viceroy is waiting to feed the medicine.\u201d Xiaowu came over and asked. \u201cIs it ready?\u201d\u201cThe public ditches have already been dug through, so there\u2019s no hurry today. Tell the Viceroy to wait.\u201d Qiao Tianya added two pieces of firewood and shifted aside the handkerchief covering his mouth and nose to say, \u201cKeep an eye on the Viceroy. He\u2019s with my Master every day. If he gets infected, we won\u2019t have any surplus medicine for him.\u201d\u201cThere was an epidemic at Luoxia Pass during the reign of Yongyi. His Lordship led his men to handle it then, and he never got infected.\u201d Xiaowu squatted down to wait. He said, \u201cI heard the various\u00a0gege\u00a0from Libei say that the Xiao Clan has the mandate of Heaven. That physique is not one a common man would have.\u201d\u201cTantai Hu is strong and sturdy too. Didn\u2019t he still fall ill just like that?\u201d Qiao Tianya said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt to be careful and pay more attention. Have you drunk this morning\u2019s medicine?\u201d\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d Xiaowu honestly answered.\u201cHow\u2019s Tantai Hu today?\u201d Qiao Tianya moved his slightly numbed legs.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t vomited since yesterday.\u201d Xiaowu said. \u201cChen-ge said that it\u2019s because he\u2019s strong, and we found out about the infection in time. He\u2019s being fed enough medicine too. Plus, the imperial physician is constantly at his side looking after him. He\u2019ll be fine!\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t let our guards down before he\u2019s awake.\u201d There seemed to be something constantly on Qiao Tianye\u2019s mind as he tossed the fan to Xiaowu. \u201cWatch the fire for me. There\u2019s some serious business I need to discuss with them.\u201dWith that, he rose to his feet and headed for the rain shelter.The curtain of the rain shelter was lifted partially as Qiao Tianya made his way inside. It was dim inside, but not damp. The beddings were also dry. An errand-runner from the Imperial Academy of Medicine washed and changed them daily. He saw Xiao Chiye in the midst of speaking to Tantai Hu, so he waited for a while.Xiao Chiye turned his head aside and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dQiao Tianya lifted the hem of his robe and took a seat at the bench by the side.Xiao Chiye caressed his thumb ring as he looked at Qiao Tianya with calm and composure.Qiao Tianya said, \u201cThe Imperial Academy of Medicine and\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0have records of this disease on file. Have you looked at it?\u201dXiao Chiye nodded his head.\u201cDo you know the cause of the outbreak in the City of Dancheng? Xiao\u2026 Viceroy.\u201d Qiao Tianya almost called out Xiao the Second again and promptly corrected himself. \u201cBefore my Master fell ill, he checked through the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0records here and specifically told me to make a note of certain matters. I\u2019ve been thinking about this disease these few days, but since Master is not yet awake, I can only discuss this with you.\u201d\u201cWhat did Lanzhou say?\u201d\u201cHe said that there\u2019s something unusual about the origin of this disease.\u201d Qiao Tianya propped his elbows on his knees and whistled at Ding Tao. \u201cRecite the details of Dancheng\u2019s epidemic to the Viceroy. You have a photographic memory; you still remember, right?\u201dDing Tao thought for a moment, then said, \u201cThere was an outbreak in the City of Dancheng during the year of Yongyi. It was summer. The Imperial Academy of Medicine dispatched a delegate to go with the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0to check on it, and they discovered something strange about this epidemic disease. After some investigation, they learned that there was a burial mound behind the outbreak site. It was dirty and messy, with no one having cleaned it up before. The corpses thrown there before the start of spring had soaked at the rear until it reeked. There was even a cooked food stall in service at the front. The weather was hot at that time, and flies were buzzing all around. The shopkeeper was the first one who fell ill. At first, no one paid it any attention; even he himself suspected it to be a cold. He grabbed some medicine and carried on with his business at the shop. Oh, my! A whole bunch of people subsequently fell ill after those cooked foods were sold. And that was when the prefectural\u00a0yamen\u00a0of Dancheng realized something wrong.\u201d\u201cA burial mound, huh? There are all kinds of people thrown there. Perhaps it just happened that one of them had some diseases or was bitten by some wild animals. Coincidentally, it had already been soaked rotten, thus becoming a feast for the flies to dine on. People are naturally susceptible to infection if they get too close.\u201d The imperial physician packed his case and said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for everyone at that time. Dancheng was sealed off for half a year, and quite many people died. We are lucky this time to have discovered it earlier, and we have the experience now. That\u2019s why we managed to take precautions in time.\u201d\u201cTrue that. But how did the outbreak happen in\u00a0Qudu?\u201d Qiao Tianya said, \u201cThe low-lying area of Donglong Street had indeed been submerged in sewage. It\u2019s only to be expected for someone to fall ill. But there are no homicide cases on Donglong Street. I\u2019ll be honest. Viceroy, please don\u2019t take offense, but being infected with venereal diseases is to be expected on Donglong Street. Why is it so strange this time that we would get an outbreak of the Dancheng epidemic disease instead?\u201dThe imperial physician tactfully found an excuse to head out.\u201cThere\u2019s no definitive explanation for the outbreak of Dancheng epidemic.\u201d Chen Yang thought for a moment, then continued, \u201cThere\u2019s a collapse and heavy rain this time, and everyone is in the water, so perhaps\u2026\u201d\u201cThere are too many epidemic diseases.\u201d Qiao Tianya said. \u201cFor example, the outbreak in Luoxia Pass at that time was a rat plague; so no way Hezhou would have an outbreak of the same plague. The situations in the various lands are different, so we can\u2019t lump them together. This humble servant is a deeply suspicious man, and an honest person does not resort to insinuations. I think this disease did not start in Donglong Street, but\u2014\u201dQiao Tianya lifted his thumb and pointed it at the roof.It fell silent under the awning. The bystanders had more or less turned pale.Qiao Tianya let out a chuckle and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it a coincidence? The celestial being met with misfortune upon descent to the mortal world. It\u2019s virtually impossible to guard against dodging a pit only to fall into a well.2\u00a0These few days, the palace has not sent any word out to us. Viceroy, the public ditch has been unclogged, and the water level has gone down. But why does this matter seem to me like it\u2019s only the beginning?\u201d\u201cEveryone living in the heavenly palace is an immortal.\u201d Xiao Chiye said slowly. \u201cThese immortals value their lives. They won\u2019t dare to play it this way. A possibility like the one you speak of is only something a desperate person at the end of his rope staking everything he has on this one throw would dare to do.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d Qiao Tianya said. \u201cThe\u00a0Directorate of Ceremonial\u00a0now lacks a major-league eunuch who can take charge and control the\u00a0twenty-four yamen. Many matters exist among the chaos where things are left unsupervised. If there\u2019s really someone who brings a certain something in, then he would be able to pass it through just by hoodwinking his way through. Our\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0and\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are all soldiers from the outside. There\u2019s nothing we can do about what\u2019s happening on the inside. But I feel that we have to take precautions and be on guard when it comes to this matter.\u201dWhy did Li Jianheng leave the palace? Was it only just to have fun? He had just been through an assassination attempt not too long ago. He was not a gutsy man, so how would he dare to sneak out on the sly? Not unless someone was putting him up to it.Xi Hongxuan would discuss everything with Shen Zechuan nowadays. Meeting with mishap this time was something he himself had never expected. And now, he was still lying on the bed with his life hanging in the balance. So who was the one who instigated Li Jianheng and brought about the collapse of Ouhua Pavilion at exactly the right moment?Xiao Chiye contemplated it in silence.His intuition told him it was not the Empress Dowager. Because Li Jianheng was already showing signs of showing filial respect to her. This, to her, was precisely the moment she could stage a comeback. She definitely would not bear to let Li Jianheng die now.Then who else is there?This time, the intent was not to intimidate Li Jianheng, but for Li Jianheng to die for real. But who would benefit if Li Jianheng died?The curtain was lifted once again. The imperial physician poked his head in and said joyfully, \u201cViceroy, His Excellency the Judge is awake!\u201dXiao Chiye quickly rose to his feet and strode a few steps out under the awning and entered the house. Shen Zechuan, who had been in a lethargic sleep for days, had his eyes half-opened. Xiao Chiye crouched softly beside the bed and gazed at him.Shen Zechuan lifted his finger and weakly caressed Xiao Chiye\u2019s brows and eyes. Xiao Chiye grabbed his hand and pressed it against his cheek.\u201cGo ahead and touch.\u201d Xiao Chiye leaned in closer to him and laughed in a husky voice, \u201cI\u2019ll let you touch.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 : Sharing A PillowShen Zechuan was in a slight daze as Xiao Chiye\u2019s stubble rubbed against his palm until it felt ticklish. He gazed at Xiao Chiye and said, \u201c\u2026 Prickly.\u201d\u201cDoes it not feel comfortable to the touch?\u201d Xiao Chiye asked.Shen Zechuan replied, \u201cComfortable.\u201dBoth men were just a short distance apart, yet it seemed as if there was no gap between them. Xiao Chiye was dirty and unkempt. He hardly had time to spare these few days to tidy up. Now, he leaned close to Shen Zechuan, giving no regard to his slovenly state as he let Shen Zechuan touch him.Chen Yang gripped the door curtain, reckoning that it was about time. He wanted to let the others enter, but then he did not hear Xiao Chiye give his permission, so he remained stuck at the entrance with a group of guards, each of them staring at the sky and the ground with a blank expression.\u201cFeel good touching it?\u201d Xiao Chiye could not help but laugh out.\u201cAlmost.\u201d Shen Zechuan pursed his lips and whispered into Xiao Chiye\u2019s ear, \u201cSo prickly, it\u2019s hurting me.\u201d\u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201d Xiao Chiye tilted his head and pressed his forehead against his.Shen Zechuan gazed at him with eyes that seemed like mountain lakes moistened with fog. He put that bit of yearning for more in those eyes and revealed it all to Xiao Chiye as he exchanged gazes with him. Even the corners of his eyes contained the barest hint of faintly discernible emotion.Xiao Chiye suddenly covered Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes. After a moment\u2019s pause, he said, \u201cThis is not the right time to egg me on, is it?\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cWhat are you thinking? I\u2019m just looking at you.\u201d\u201cNot letting you look.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cDo it when we get back.\u201dOutside, Chen Yang let out a few coughs and raised his voice to say, \u201cMaster\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye shifted his palm away, stood up, and said, \u201cCome in.\u201dOnly then did Chen Yang lift the curtain, and everyone entered in a single file.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan leaned against the pillow with an overcoat draped over him. As he drank the medicine, he listened to them recount the details of what had transpired in recent days. When Qiao Tianya was done speaking, he contemplated for a moment before he said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. There\u2019s something fishy about this matter from start to end. I also suspect that the collapse of Ouhua Pavilion is not a coincidence, but a deliberate act that took advantage of the opportunity offered by the blockage of Donglong Street\u2019s public ditches.\u201d\u201cIt has only been half a year since His Majesty\u2019s ascension to the throne. With so many things waiting to be done now, it\u2019s just the time for everyone to get their big break.\u201d Xiao Chiye sat on the bench beside him. \u201cWho could bear to let him die?\u201dThis was also what Shen Zechuan could not figure out. He finished his medicine and handed the bowl to Qiao Tianya, then said, \u201cWe can\u2019t very well investigate matters in the palace. We need to have a suitable person on the inside before we can do it.\u201dIt was not a good thing for the position of the Brush-holding Director of the\u00a0Directorate of Ceremonial\u00a0to be vacant. Xiao Chiye and Shen Zechuan both could not interfere in matters within the palace. That was the Empress Dowager\u2019s territory. The Empress Dowager had the final say over who would be appointed to the post in the future. But it was better than nothing. If they had a planted agent inside, then that would also be a lot better than being completely blind.When Shen Zechuan thought to this point, he suddenly asked, \u201cYou wanted to investigate Xiang Yun the last time. Did you find out anything?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cI was so busy I forgot about that. Gu Jin.\u201dGu Jin stepped out and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t find out any crucial information when I went to Xiangyun Villa. Xiangyun has only those few patrons. I checked them out one by one, and none of them had anything to do with the perjury matter the last time.\u201dShen Zechuan somehow kept feeling as though there was something he had missed. There was an unseen hand pulling strings behind the scenes that gave rise to these incidents. There must have been some causal relationship between them. He lost himself in his thoughts again. He did not know if it was because he had just recovered from a bout of illness, but no matter how he thought, he could not figure out the link.\u201cHis Majesty is still unconscious, and his disease has not completely subsided. We still have a few days to spare; there is no rush at this point in time.\u201d As Xiao Chiye spoke, he moved his shoulders and arms. \u201cThe public ditches are now unclogged. So everyone should rest well these few days. This matter will eventually be resolved. It\u2019s now more important to conserve our strength and energy for the next stage.\u201dThe guards echoed in agreement and retreated out of the house. Once they were all gone, Xiao Chiye sat at the edge of the bed and took off his boots.\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten your fill of sleep, but this Second Young Master is still barely hanging on.\u201d Xiao Chiye lay down beside Shen Zechuan and said, \u201cCome closer. Be my blanket and cover me.\u201dShen Zechuan turned his head sideways and said, \u201cSleep with an overcoat draped over you.\u201dXiao Chiye closed his eyes and said, \u201cYou do it.\u201dShen Zechuan tucked the pillow under Xiao Chiye\u2019s neck. Xiao Chiye made a blind grab for Shen Zechuan\u2019s hand and grasped his wrist in passing. Then he pulled Shen Zechuan towards him and embraced him.\u201cToo thin.\u201d Xiao Chiye touched him. \u201cSo much that your bones jab against me when I hug you. Once autumn arrives, the wild game from Libei will be here too. You\u2019ll need all the nourishment you can get then, and you\u2019ll be able to fatten up by the time it\u2019s winter.\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s breathing was slightly heavy. Feeling sleepy, he turned his head and pressed the tip of his nose against Shen Zechuan\u2019s temple. Then he forced a smile and said, \u201c\u2026 Sleep with your Second Young Master for a while.\u201dXiao Chiye was exhausted. He had not got any shut-eye these few days as he had to stay awake in both the day and night like a lone wolf pacing around his base. No matter how physically strong he was, there would come a time he would exhaust his strength and energy. Shen Zechuan was on top of him. Xiao Chiye found this weight just perfect, with the pressure on him making him feel warm and content.Xiao Chiye initially wanted to sleep for a while so he could do a proper tally at night for the medicinal herb expenses incurred over the last few days. But who knew that he would sleep until the third quarter of the hour of\u00a0yin1\u00a0the next day? Still in a trance when he woke up, he turned on his side and buried himself between Shen Zechuan\u2019s arms.Xiao Chiye was momentarily dazed before his mind suddenly cleared. He propped himself up for a look. Turned out that his head had slipped off the pillow last night, and he had been lying on Shen Zechuan\u2019s arm for the latter half of the night. Shen Zechuan had turned to his side with his head resting on the pillow, while his other hand had pulled over the overcoat and covered him with it. This was a posture similar to a protective hug.Dawn had yet to come. It was dark inside the room.Xiao Chiye fell back onto the pillow and hugged Shen Zechuan over to himself, face-first. The overcoat just about covered both of them. He asked in a husky voice, \u201cDid I make your arm numb?\u201dShen Zechuan, half-awake, let out an affirmative \u201chm\u201d.Xiao Chiye rubbed Shen Zechuan\u2019s stiff arm and said, \u201cCan\u2019t you just call me?\u201dWarmed, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cXiao\u2019Er\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cHm?\u201dShen Zechuan opened his eyes to look at him and said, \u201cYou were calling out for Shen Lanzhou in your sleep.\u201dXiao Chiye smiled and kept his voice down as he said, \u201cJust dreaming about what I think of in the daytime.\u201dBoth of them were very close to one another. Shen Zechuan\u2019s gaze on him made Xiao Chiye\u2019s body and heart both hot. His recently recharged energy from having slept enough skyrocketed. He wanted to tease Shen Zechuan, but at the same time, he also wanted to let Shen Zechuan sleep.Some random bird was cooing outside, sending a ripple reverberating through the silent night.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cWas the reason you asked about Xiangyun earlier because you thought of something?\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cWhere is Mu Ru from? Was she the girl the former Emperor bought?\u201d\u201cShe was a birthday gift the manor down there gave to His Majesty.\u201d Xiao Chiye wrapped his arms around Shen Zechuan. \u201cAt first, she was kept in the manor. It took a lot of effort just to train her. I saw from her registered birthplace that she\u2019s a native of the City of Jincheng. You think it\u2019s her?\u201d\u201cBecause of the assassination attempt, His Majesty came to detest eunuchs completely. There has never been any eunuch he\u2019s on close terms with after Shuanglu. The palace maids who usually wait upon him by his side are all carefully selected people. The only person who can egg him on and help him out of the palace is Mu Ru.\u201d Shen Zechuan lost himself in his thoughts again as he spoke. \u201cIf it\u2019s her, there must be a reason\u2026 She does not have an imperial heir at present. She can only live if His Majesty is alive. So she should be more concerned about His Majesty\u2019s safety than anyone else.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the thing.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cThe one who can pull off such a scheme must have thought it through carefully. There has to be a reason. The late Emperor\u2019s sudden death and the Hua Clan\u2019s subsequent fall from power did not simply result in the removal of a few\u00a0wusha\u00a0hats.2\u00a0It even affected the situational arrangements of Dazhou\u2019s various lands. In the past six months, Hai Liangyi has been locked in a stalemate in his face-off with the noble clans and barely managed to stabilize the situation. It would benefit no one if the current Emperor were to meet with misfortune now.\u201d\u201cWe have to wait for His Majesty to wake up before we can know more.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cThe Ministry of Works made such a slip-up this time. Pan Xiangjie will be hard-pressed to absolve himself of blame. He will definitely be censured and held back for investigation. Have you seen the governmental clerk from the Ministry of Works, Liang Cuishan?\u201d\u201cYup, I\u2019ve seen him.\u201d Xiao Chiye thought for a moment. \u201cHe is one diligent man.\u201d\u201cI got him to keep a detailed record of all the medicinal herbs coming and going these few days. Once we go out, the Ministry of Revenue and the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0will come to check the accounts. You just have to hand over this book to them.\u201d\u201cWell done.\u201d Xiao Chiye was not stingy with his praises. \u201cWhen the epidemic broke out, there was no time at all to wait for the memo from the palace. I got my men to get the herbs from the medicine shops. The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0has our own handwritten notes on record. But, when all is said and done, it\u2019s not as convincing as the testimony of a man from the Ministry of Revenue. With this book, the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0and the Ministry of Revenue won\u2019t have to rip into each other.\u201dXiao Chiye hated to deal with the officials from the Ministry of Revenue. It was so much trouble just to reconcile accounts with them every year. With this major issue of the public ditches being clogged, those old foxes might even think of dragging the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0into the mire so as to put the Grand Secretariat in a spot; after all, the law could not be enforced if everyone was an offender! The beginning of spring was also the most complicated time for political affairs, where piled-up mountains of official documents instantly gave the Grand Secretariat a massive headache.\u201cYou have no wish to see the Ministry of Revenue, and they are also afraid to see you.\u201d Shen Zechuan laughed. \u201cThe matter of Quancheng silk the last time implicated Wang Xian. I see that he has already been transferred to the Ministry of Rites. Was that your handiwork?\u201d\u201cI bear no personal grudge against him. The collections of debts in the past were simply official business. Because of me, he was implicated and slapped with an ill reputation for bribery. Shifting him over to the Ministry of Rites is merely a stop-gap measure.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cHis hope of getting an \u2018outstanding\u2019 this inspection is definitely dashed. Even if he\u2019s appointed a post outside the capital, he\u2019ll only be sent to somewhere remote and barren.\u201dWang Xian was unlucky. He originally served as the Secretary in the Ministry of Revenue and had a very hard time dealing with Xiao Chiye. A few years ago, when the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s equipment was worn out, Xiao Chiye was the one who personally hemmed him in to reconcile accounts and hound for money every time they carried out manual labor. He had no personal relationship with Xiao Chiye to speak of at all. Who would have expected an unexpected calamity to come flying out of the blue? Xiao Chiye was denounced before the Emperor, and by sheer coincidence, those Quancheng silks passed through his hands; there was no way he could explain himself. In the end, Xiao Chiye and Li Jianheng fell back on their brotherly ties and acted out the roles of a harmonious ruler and his minister. But he was stripped of his Secretary post for real and almost became a prisoner. He could no longer be an official in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0now, and even if he were to be assigned a post outside the capital, there was nowhere decent to go. He even got an assessment of \u201cnegligence of duty\u201d for the inspection. Half a lifetime of prudence and caution\u2014wasted. What a grave injustice.But something clicked in Shen Zechuan\u2019s mind, and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you are thinking of making use of this opportunity and assign him to Zhongbo?\u201dXiao Chiye laughed and said, \u201cTo think you could even guess this.\u201dXiao Chiye gave Wang Xian a helping hand and had him moved to the Ministry of Rites. At the very least, the latter managed to secure his job and means of livelihood. In the past, Wang Xian disliked him, but now he had to be deeply grateful to him. Xiao Chiye planned to transfer Wang Xian to Zhongbo when the latter was appointed to a post outside the capital. At present, Zhongbo was full of rogues and bandits. Everyone all wanted to stuff their own people in there.\u201cWe can\u2019t get close to other places. But we must plant manpower in Cizhou.\u201d Xiao Chiye relaxed and said. \u201cThat was a good suggestion you gave for the demolition subsidy. Cizhou\u2019s Prefectural Prefect, Zhou Gui, is now on good terms with us. He will naturally understand the implication if we put Wang Xian under his command. The Six Prefectures of Zhongbo will definitely put an emphasis on supervision this year. But no matter who the imperial court deploys over, Cizhou has to remain under my watch.\u201dCizhou was close to the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path. By doing this, Xiao Chiye was keeping an eye from where he was in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0on the main entrances to the granaries for the Libei Armored Cavalry. He and Xiao Jiming had hardly exchanged correspondences, but the two brothers understood each other perfectly.\u201cThe Quancheng silk is a latent danger. If Fu Linye had not been too eager for fast returns and messed up by some freak coincidence, then this account would be a blade buried deep in the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s account book.\u201d Shen Zechuan moved his head and said, \u201cWas this account handled by Xue Xiuzhuo?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s him, all right.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cXue Xiuzhou, huh\u2026 What do you think of him?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t really pay him any notice at first. But I checked his evaluations for the past few years\u2019 inspections, and they were all outstanding. He joined the imperial court during the reign of Yongyi, those last three years of Emperor Guancheng. It was only when Emperor Xiande ascended to the throne that he assumed the post of Chief Supervising Secretary in the Ministry of Revenue. He held this position for eight years until the sudden rebellion at Nanlin Hunting Grounds last year. He was then promoted and transferred to the Court of Judicial Review, where he became the Assistant Minister of the Court of Judicial Review. He then went on to handle two major cases that concern Hi Majesty\u2019s safety\u2014the Hua and Pan\u2019s rebellion case and the Feast of A Hundred Officials\u2019s assassination case. He has a good reputation, has extensive contacts in the\u00a0Eight Great Clans, and is on good terms with the officials from humble backgrounds headed by Hai Liangyi.\u201d Shen Zechuan pondered over it for a moment before saying, \u201cBut I know nothing of his background before he entered the imperial court.\u201d\u201cI know of it pretty well.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cAsk me.\u201dShen Zechuan raised his eyebrows slightly and said, \u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t that sound like someone who has a favor to ask of?\u201d Xiao Chiye gathered the overcoat around him and put his head to Shen Zechuan\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you only if you coax me until I\u2019m happy.\u201dThe way he said it was frivolous, partially to tease Shen Zechuan. He did not expect Shen Zechuan to look at him, part his lips to puff out a breath, and murmured under hot and soft breath at such close quarters, \u201cCe\u2019an~\u201dThat tiny puff of damp heat landed on Xiao Chiye\u2019s cheeks and edged along his straight nose to the front of his lips. Both men touched, almost imperceptibly.Xiao Chiye suddenly rolled over and propped himself up above Shen Zechuan, leaving a space between them. He pinched Shen Zechuan\u2019s chin to correct its position and said, \u201cAll talk and no action\u2014this Second Young Master won\u2019t fall for it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 : Lovemaking\u201cThen what will you fall for?\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s narrowed his eyes from the pinch, making it hard to tell if he was in discomfort or pleasure. His expression was very alluring, as if fanning the flames.Light through the window was faint. Xiao Chiye observed Shen Zechuan at close proximity, then reached out and stroked the corner of Shen Zechuan\u2019s lips with his thumb. He said, \u201cGet a feel of it yourself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid someone will say one thing but mean another.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s lips parted and closed as he spoke. The tip of his tongue appeared indistinctly, casting moist warmth on Xiao Chiye\u2019s thumb, yet Xiao Chiye could not touch a thing.\u201cWho\u2019s acting contradictorily?\u201d Xiao Chiye leaned over and pressed down on him. \u201cSecond Young Master is so honest.\u201d\u201cHonest indeed.\u201d Shen Zechuan sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re so hard.\u201d\u201cI just had my fill of sleep.\u201d Xiao Chiye was feeling him up. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been abstaining for quite a number of days to let it all build up. So give me a sweet little treat?\u201dShen Zechuan exchanged a gentle kiss with him and said, \u201cI just recovered from a serious illness, so let\u2019s keep it first for another time. I really\u2026 don\u2019t have the energy.\u201d\u201cWho would bear to let you exert yourself in bed?\u201d Xiao Chiye asked, \u201cWould I bear to do that?\u201d\u201cYou would.\u201d Shen Zechuan gazed at him and said softly, \u201cWhatever you say now are just words to coax and trick me. Once we get on the bed, it all counts for nothing.\u201dXiao Chiye chuckled. \u201cIs that so? So what did I say when I cajoled you?\u201dShen Zechuan lifted a finger to block Xiao Chiye\u2019s lips, which was about to drop a kiss. \u201cIf you want to hear all about it, then first tell me about Xue Xiuzhuo.\u201dXiao Chiye tightened his arms around him and asked, \u201cWhat do you want to hear? His background before he served as an official is nothing impressive. Xue Xiuzhuo is a son of common birth, born of a concubine in the Xue Clan. Since his early years, he has never been a favored child. Look at his age. He\u2019s older than Xi Hongxuan and Yao Wenyu by a few years. By all logic, he shouldn\u2019t be attending school at the same time as them, so how did he become their fellow student? It\u2019s all because he has been neglected at home back then, and the delay by his family caused him to get a late start in his education.\u201d\u201cThis person looks refined and has a way in the way he conducts himself in society and deals with people. Compared to Xi Hongxuan, he seemed more like a son of lawful birth from the noble clans.\u201d\u201cHe was already eleven years of age when he enrolled in the academy.\u201d As if recalling this person, Xiao Chiye thought it over carefully for a moment before he continued, \u201cHe\u2019s talented and intelligent, and he\u2019s willing to study hard, so it didn\u2019t take him long to stand out from the bunch of noble clans\u2019 descendants. But the good times didn\u2019t last long. A few years later, Yao Wenyu also enrolled in the academy.\u201d\u201cEveryone now wants to associate with \u2018Unpolished Jade Yuanzhuo\u20191\u00a0to show that they are genuine talents too. But at that time, their teacher was Teacher Chang Zong, who was well known for being harsh and exacting. Once Yao Wenyu joined them, the number of times the others got criticized and punished increased. This was because no one could outdo Yao Wenyu when it came to strategies and literary essays. The moment his writings surfaced, no one else\u2019s works could ever again catch Teacher Chang Zong\u2019s eyes. Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s limelight was thus stolen in those few years. After that, he never displayed his talents again.\u201d\u201cLater on, Yao Wenyu became Hai Liangyi\u2019s student. You know what Hai Liangyi is like, so you can get a glimpse of how talented Yao Wenyu must be for him to be able to become Hai Liangyi\u2019s student. But what the others didn\u2019t know is that the one who first sent a visitation card2\u00a0to Hai Liangyi was Xue Xiuzhuo. He kowtowed thrice to Hai Liangyi, but in the end, Hai Liangyi didn\u2019t accept him as his student. If this had happened to someone else, then even if they didn\u2019t have a falling out with Hai Liangyi, they would still bear a grudge. But that\u2019s what\u2019s so impressive about Xue Xiuzhuo. He was there on the day Yao Wenyu underwent the rites to become a formal pupil of Hai Liangyi. Not only was he there, but he was also even the one holding the crown. Hai Liangyi disliked him, yet Xue Xiuzhuo had never once uttered a word of grievance and resentment. Hai Liangyi\u2019s residence was bestowed upon him by Emperor Guangcheng back then. The Secretariat Elder is usually particular about having his peace and staying clean; he doesn\u2019t receive local officials as guests in private, and he doesn\u2019t arrange for excessive errand-runners to assign tasks. There was this one year when his pavilion collapsed. When Xue Xiuzhuo heard about it, he didn\u2019t even take his meal and instead went to replace the stones for Hai Liangyi personally.\u201d\u201cHe holds Secretariat Elder Hai in high esteem.\u201d Remembering, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cWhen I looked up his past inspections\u2019 evaluations, I also saw his essays on contemporary politics from those few years when he had just entered public service. They were all discourses on increasing incomes and reducing expenditures, and straightening out the local field books,3\u00a0which were also issues that gave Hai Liangyi headaches when he first entered the Grand Secretariat.\u201d\u201cHe is more like Hai Liangyi\u2019s student than Yao Wenyu. Hai Liangyi used to serve in the Ministry of Revenue for over ten years, so he\u2019s very well aware of all the dirty tricks used in the local accounts. To get to the bottom of the accounts then, Xue Xiuzhuo was the one he assigned. As such, Xue Xiuzhuo took on the post of the Ministry of Revenue\u2019s Chief Supervising Secretary with the specific purpose of inspecting and auditing the various accounts.\u201d Xiao Chiye lay back down on the bed with Shen Zechuan in his embrace and continued, \u201cI think that his current social connections were all established back at that time. He remained in the Chief Supervising Secretary post for eight years, and his evaluations were all outstanding. He should have long been promoted, but he never received a promotion. Why? Because Hai Liangyi had the intent to hold him back.\u201d\u201cLooks like Secretariat Elder Hai was moved by his sincerity. To think he was willing to spend time to polish Xue Xiuzhuo. With this camaraderie, even if both men aren\u2019t teacher and pupil in name, the relationship between them has already surpassed even that of one.\u201d Shen Zechuan slowly furrowed his brows. \u201cServing as the Ministry of Revenue\u2019s Chief Supervising Secretary, he can go down to the localities. He has subordinates handling the accounts under his leadership, and he also holds the special privilege of directly submitting petitions to the Emperor. It\u2019d be a piece of cake for him to befriend anyone he wants to be friends with.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The Provincial Administration Commissioner of Juexi is Jiang Qingshan. This is not a man to be underestimated. The last time when Xue Xiuzhuo blew the whistle on Hua Siqian, Jiang Qingshan was the man he investigated the accounts with. Jiang Qingshan\u2019s achievements are remarkable. Back then, when\u00a0Qudu\u00a0fell behind on the aid relief funds to Juexi, it was him who did all he could to bear the costs and carried on handling the matter without letting the Thirteen Cities of Juexi succumb to starvation. He is bold and decisive in what he does; he has the courage to act first and report later. A man with an iron fist. But he has a bad temper and doesn\u2019t really socialize much with the officials from the capital. When the parties of Hua and Pan were at the height of their powers, he never once paid Pan Rugui \u2018ice respect\u2019.4\u00a0 He\u2019s a dauntless man, and he has the capability to go with it. That\u2019s why even though Hua Siqian hated him, he was not able to get him demoted. A man like him who doesn\u2019t even think much of Yao Wenyu could still be on close terms with Xue Xiuzhuo and call Xue Xiuzhuo his brother. So you can imagine how good Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s ability to make friends is.\u201dXiao Chiye suddenly paused.\u201cIt\u2019s actually all due to Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s own competence that Secretariat Elder Hai would later come to promote him. Last time, you spoke about luring the noble clans into a trap. I think you\u2019ve hit the nail on the head. There\u2019s no telling if Xue Xiuzhuo can really make it into the Grand Secretariat.\u201d\u201cI noticed that this person is very contradictory.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cHis essays on contemporary politics in the previous years were all about the commoners\u2019 welfare and livelihood. He went down to the localities, and the stuff he did was all practical and real. Yet, he\u2019s inseparable from the noble clans\u2019 younger generations like Xi Hongxuan and the likes. The matter of Quancheng silk is a critical point. I think he\u2019s a deep one; he\u2019s not acting at random, but planning far ahead.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that there was a man at the helm hiding in\u00a0Qudu?\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s expression grew a little more serious. \u201cHe\u2019s a good candidate.\u201d\u201cHis official grade wasn\u2019t high six years ago when Zhongbo troops were defeated, and he was young to boot. So how can he manipulate those noble clans\u2019 old foxes? Just one Wei Clan is a pain to deal with. My guess is that if there\u2019s really such a person, he should be of the same age as Hai Liangyi. Otherwise, with this kind of credentials, it would be hard to convince the others.\u201d\u201cNevertheless, there are too few clues. We\u2019ll still need to deal with them carefully in the future.\u201d Xiao Chiye rubbed Shen Zechuan\u2019s wrist and said, \u201cThe collapse of Ouhua Pavilion is not without benefits. Xi Hongxuan is frightened out of his wits this time. Even if he wants to look for you for a drink in the future, there is nowhere to go.\u201d\u201cWine can be drunk anywhere. Even if his Ouhua Pavilion has collapsed, there are still other establishments. It\u2019s Xiangyun who is gone that will be really gone for good.\u201d Shen Zechuan looked askance at him. \u201cSecond Young Master has really suffered a loss.\u201d\u201cWithout Xiangyun, I can always look for someone else.\u201d Xiao Chiye looked at him. \u201cBeauties are aplenty; isn\u2019t there one right here?\u201dWith his fingertips, Shen Zechuan drew a few strokes on his palm and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have five hundred taels, I won\u2019t drink with you.\u201cI am filthy poor.\u201d Xiao Chiye caught his teasing fingertips. \u201cI have no money, so I can only give you something else.\u201d\u201cWhat rare item is that to be able to move my heart?\u201d Shen Zechuan asked.Xiao Chiye guided his hand to land on his waist. \u201cSecond Young Master is a fine specimen of a man. So, what do you think?\u201d\u201cI, Shen Lanzhou, am also a dashing man.\u201d Shen Zechuan said leisurely, \u201cI can just admire myself in the mirror; there\u2019s no need for another person.\u201d\u201cYou still don\u2019t know how to have fun.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cHow can self-admiration be as delightful as being admired by me? Both of us have to be reflected in the mirror for it to be aesthetically rousing.\u201dWith glistening eyes rippling with desires, Shen Zechuan asked, \u201cSo what\u2019s considered aesthetically rousing?\u201d\u201cSeeing is believing.\u201d Xiao Chiye checked Shen Zechuan\u2019s temperature. \u201cTry it with me one of these days, and you\u2019ll find out.\u201dHis caresses made Shen Zechuan gasp softly for breath. Both men had not found relief for a long time, and they had just survived the epidemic. All the energy that had just been recovered pooled in their lower abdomens, weighing down on it. And now, all these hugging and fondling had ignited the first signs of desires.\u201cShen Zechuan with a pure heart and few desires.\u201d Xiao Chiye sighed with deep feelings under his breath. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I tell which is it?\u201d\u201cThat is Shen Zechuan; you are calling for Shen Lanzhou.\u201d Shen Zechuan asked, \u201cWho do you want?\u201d\u201cI want both of them.\u201d Xiao Chiye scooped Shen Zechuan up, made him lean on one side, and pressed down against him from behind. \u201cAre you giving, or not?\u201dWith half of his face buried in the bedding, Shen Zechuan merely panted without saying a word. Xiao Chiye bit him. His ears were sensitive, and the licking and biting caused his gasps to hitch. Scarlet tints materialized at the corners of his eyes.\u201cChen Yang boiled some water. I\u2019ll let you wash up before dawn.\u201d Xiao Chiye lowered his head and called out to him in a nasal tone, \u201cLanzhou.\u201dThe bed was makeshift for emergency use. It was small and narrow, and it was a strain on both men to squeeze onto it. Xiao Chiye did not dare to thrust right in. Instead, he entered slowly and gingerly from the side. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0outside all had keen hearing. Shen Zechuan did not make a sound and tugged at the overcoat amidst those alternating deep thrusts and shallow withdrawals, even as the sensation of melting apart engulfed him.They were breathing unevenly\u2014both afraid the other would cry out loud, so they kissed, neck against neck. The bed shook gently. Xiao Chiye\u2019s repressed desire fired up, but he could not rock hard into Shen Lanzhou. All he could do was to grind against him.Between the kisses, Xiao Chiye said in a hushed tone, \u201cCry out for me again.\u201dShen Lanzhou said, \u201cCe\u2026\u2026 Mhn\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye laughed. He thrusted a little harder and said, \u201cWhat does \u2018Ce\u2019an, mhn, Ce\u2019an\u2019 mean?\u201dShen Zechuan could not take it anymore and did not dare to reply. Xiao Chiye\u2019s finger pressed into his mouth, moving and stroking for a little while as he hugged him tightly from the back, thrusting in deep until Shen Zechuan almost moaned out loud.Without them realizing it, the day began to break outside as their bout of lovemaking left them drenched in sweat. Considering that Shen Zechuan had just woken up, and that it was not the place for this, Xiao Chiye only did it once. Even after they hastily concluded things, Shen Zechuan remained flushed for a long while. He did not even want to lift a finger during the cleaning up.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8On the other end, Liang Cuishan looked at the sky and saw that it was almost dawn, so he sorted out the books from these few days and put them in order in preparation of making his report when he met Shen Zechuan. He took a detour to the place and saw Ge Qingqing drinking tea under the rain shelter awning, so he greeted him and asked, \u201cIs His Excellency the Judge better today? This humble subordinate has tidied up the accounts and specifically come to report the details.\u201dGe Qingqing did not speak. Chen Yang just happened to walk down and replied, \u201cHis Excellency the Judge has just recovered from a serious illness, and the epidemic has just passed. His Excellency is also concerned about infecting all of you, so he\u2019s not receiving guests today. If the nature of this account permits, I can send it in on behalf of Your Excellency later?\u201dHaving been ordered by Shen Zechuan to record the accounts, Liang Cuishan did not dare to be sloppy. Naturally, he could not just hand the accounts over to Chen Yang. Thus, he merely said, \u201cI\u2019m glad His Excellency is fine. Since it\u2019s not convenient today, this humble subordinate will request an audience again tomorrow.\u201dChen Yang nodded, and Liang Cuishan took his leave. Before he left, he noticed that there was no one else around that house, so he knew that the area had been cleared of people, and there were personal guards standing watch. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0were on duty, and Shen Zechuan was personally appointed by the Emperor himself, so he reckoned that there was probably still work to be done. Not daring to take another look or ask another question, he hurried away.Not long after, the shadow before the door shook slightly. Xiao Chiye lifted the curtain and stepped out. He had already changed into a clean robe. There was a pair of half-aged boots on his feet, and Shen Zechuan\u2019s ivory fan in his hand. He asked, \u201cWas he here to report the accounts?\u201d\u201cI told him to come tomorrow.\u201d Chen Yang said.Xiao Chiye walked down the steps. Now that he felt refreshed, the hostility that had been in his expression a few days before had all dissipated. He asked, \u201cHas\u00a0Laohu\u2019s fever subsided?\u201d\u201cYes. He\u2019s feeling more spirited too, and he ate quite a bit this morning. He wanted to pay his respects to Master. I told him to come again tomorrow too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go see him.\u201d Xiao Chiye weighed the fan in his hands and said, \u201cThe water in the streets has receded, and the sky is now clear. We won\u2019t need to stay at Zhao Zui Temple for two days before there should be news from the palace. How about Xi Hongxuan?\u201d\u201cHe has woken up. But men from the Eight Great Training Divisions are keeping a tight watch on him. They aren\u2019t letting anyone see him.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry.\u201d Xiao Chiye said with a hint of a smile. \u201cHis Majesty should have already woken up too. Xi Hongxuan can\u2019t escape this. The\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0is waiting to impeach him.\u201dThe public ditches had been dredged up, and the epidemic did not manage to break out in full. The entire matter was beautifully handled. The people at the top did not have to suffer, and it was due to all the credit of those who rolled and crawled at the bottom. It was time to settle the score. He, Xiao Ce\u2019an, had now slept his fill and ate to his content. He had all the spirit and energy to dawdle with them.Chen Yang was by his side when Xiao Chiye suddenly asked, \u201cThe earring I had you made the last time, are they done crafting it? When we return to the residence in a few days, I\u2019ll go collect it on the way.\u201dChen Yang said, \u201cI told them to craft it as quickly as possible; it should be done by now. But what rationale is there for a master to go personally? I\u2019ll collect it on your behalf.\u201d\u201cI have to collect this thing personally,\u201d Xiao Chiye tossed the ivory fan in his hands to Chen Yang and took the lead as he walked away \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll go pay Tantai Hu a visit.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 : Evaluation of MeritLi Jianheng was unconscious for a few days, delirious with nightmares and mumbling incoherent words no one could understand. Mu Ru stayed by his bedside, personally feeding him medicine and wiping down his body.The Empress Dowager did not use her royal sedan today. Instead, she took advantage of the good weather to take a leisurely stroll with Third Missy Hua. She said, \u201cLady Mu is still staying by the Emperor\u2019s side keeping watch over him?\u201dSupporting the Empress Dowager, Matron Liuxiang said, \u201cShe hasn\u2019t left at all.\u201d\u201cWith everything she has done, the Emperor\u2019s affections for her would increase from a six to a ten.\u201d The Empress Dowager said to Hua Xiangyi, \u201cThis relationship would take on more weight now that they have shared weals and woes together.\u201d\u201cLady Mu may seem delicate and petite,\u201d Hua Xiangyi followed after the Empress Dowager and said, with the Empress Dowager\u2019s words in mind, \u201cBut she is also a gutsy one.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s very accurate.\u201d The Empress Dowager said, \u201cYesterday, the imperial physician mentioned that His Majesty is fine now and should wake soon. When His Majesty wakes, it\u2019ll be Lady Mu\u2019s time to shine. I saw how badly she was lambasted by the imperial censors before, but today, even Hai Liangyi himself would have to sigh and commend her for the good woman she is. If she\u2019s someone timid, would she dare risk herself like this?\u201dHua Xiangyi smiled as she took over the blue and white porcelain bowl1\u00a0from Liuxiang\u2019s hands and tossed fish baits into the newly converted lake. She said, \u201cHow can she be His Majesty\u2019s favorite if she doesn\u2019t have a little gut? She already knew how and when to advance and retreat from her time with Pan Rugui.\u201dThe Empress Dowager looked at the brocade carps in the lake vying for the food and said, \u201cThe outbreak of this epidemic is fishy. We could have dealt with Lady Mu and have her sent away for bewitching and leading the Emperor astray with her words. But she\u2019s smart. She knows that getting close to His Majesty is an amnesty from death.2\u00a0With her taking care of him to this extent, the only one to be in for a rough time in the aftermath is Xi Hongxuan. In the previous suppression of Xiao Chiye, the noble clans lost Wei Huaixing. Fu Linye has also been denounced and demoted. In the end, no one benefited from it. And now that the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0has carried out such an urgent task like the dredging up of public ditches, Xiao Chiye will surely be rewarded.\u201d\u201cXi Hongxuan deserves to be punished.\u201d Hua Xiangyi said. \u201cHe who gives no thought to difficulties in the future is sure to be beset by worries much closer at hand. Aunt, I think he has gotten too carried away by his own success because of his transfer to the Bureau of Evaluations in the Ministry of Revenue. It\u2019s no coincidence that this misfortune has befallen him. If he had been prudent enough, how could anyone get the chance to plot against him? Now that someone has given him to Xiao the Second as a stepping stone to trample on, it\u2019s only fitting for him to be punished. Moreover, while I was making inquiries about the matters concerning Qidong, I heard that the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0of Libei had given Zhongbo\u2019s Cizhou 40,000 taels as aid relief during heavy snow3\u00a0before the new year. It was also in part due to these 40,000 taels that Xiao the Second was able to persuade the Ministry of Revenue. Because of this, Cizhou and Libei have now become friends in times of adversity. In the future, when the imperial court dispatches the Provincial Administration Commissioner to administer the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo, they would have to show some consideration for Libei too.\u201d\u201cThe one who benefits the most this time is Xiao Chiye. It\u2019s not far-fetched even if one were to claim that he was the one who released the epidemic.\u201d With her fingertips, the Empress Dowager rubbed the baits into crumbs and sprinkled them into the lake. \u201cLady Mu is in such good health, so why is it there still no news of an imperial heir? If we can\u2019t get rid of her, then we can only have her in our grasp. Once she has a child, I won\u2019t have to worry about the future.\u201dIn truth, the Li Clan had quite a number of descendants. But during Emperor Guangcheng\u2019s reign, the crown prince committed suicide by slitting his own throat, and the princes who ranked below him either died or were deposed, leaving only Emperor Xiande and Li Jianheng. Emperor Xiande reigned for eight years. And because his health was poor, only Imperial Concubine Wei got pregnant with a baby. But on those few days of national mourning, someone drowned Imperial Concubine in a well without so much as a squeak. Subsequently, there was only Li Jianheng left. Even after Li Jianheng ascended to the throne, there was still no news of pregnancy from the imperial concubines in the palace.The Empress Dowager despised Mu Ru, who had come from an eunuch\u2019s compound. She had originally intended to pick a smart and astute girl from the remaining maidens of the Hua Clan in Dicheng and appointed her hand in marriage to Li Jianheng as an imperial consort. Li Jianheng was not a passionate man who was crazy about love, so once he had a new lover, he would surely give his old flame the cold shoulder. Who would have expected Mu Ru to be both clever and gutsy enough to sway the Emperor through pillow talk and speak up numerous times for the Empress Dowager? If the Empress Dowager wanted to raise the future Crown Prince in her own palace, then she had to keep an eye on Mu Ru\u2019s belly now.\u201cSpeaking of benefit, Lady Mu has also gained from this misfortune.\u201d Hua Xiangyi wiped her hands. \u201cShe still has a younger brother. Does Aunt remember?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s called Fengquan.\u201d Matron Liuxiang quietly reminded the Empress Dowager from behind.\u201cI vaguely remember such a person.\u201d The Empress Dowager said, \u201cDidn\u2019t he acknowledge Pan Rugui as his grandfather? Pan Rugui has been executed. His Majesty secretly retained him for Lady Mu\u2019s sake, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cFengquan has once received a recommendation from Aunt for a promotion. I\u2019m sure he still remembers Aunt\u2019s kindness.\u201d Hua Xiangyi supported the Empress Dowager by the arm. \u201cAunt, this sister and brother pair now have no one to rely on. If you give them a little endorsement for a promotion, then to them, you\u2019ll be like the Goddess of Mercy, Guanyin.\u201dThe Empress Dowager took a few steps and said, \u201cThat Fengquan is a eunuch. Call him back. There\u2019s so many vacancies in the\u00a0Twenty-four Yamen. Liuxiang, arrange a good post for him. Consider it a fulfillment of the siblings\u2019 wish.\u201dLiuxiang uttered an acknowledgment.The Empress Dowager asked again, \u201cHas Qidong replied? How can the wedding date be scheduled in the autumn? The autumn wind in the Cang Commandery of Qidong is strong. I can\u2019t bear to let you marry over during that period.\u201dHua Xiangyi merely smiled. Matron Liuxiang said, \u201cThe old commander has replied, saying that he\u2019ll leave it all up to Your Majesty to make the decision, as long as it falls on an auspicious day and hour. The messenger even specially brought along a few chests of Hezhou\u2019s silk and satin for the Third Missy. The head ornaments were also crafted with care and attention\u2014he clearly has put his heart into this.\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t he put his heart into it?\u201d The Empress Dowager\u2019s smile diminished. \u201cHe has received such a momentous imperial favor.\u201dLiuxiang immediately lowered herself in obeisance and said, \u201cHe should. In order not to make Third Missy feel slighted and aggrieved, the men Qidong chose for the bridal escort squad4\u00a0are all respectable generals, and the one leading the procession is none other than Commander-in-Chief Qi.\u201dThe Empress Dowager\u2019s expression underwent a subtle change. In the end, she did not fly into a rage and merely said, \u201cI\u2019ve specifically sent a letter to the Bianjun Commandery to get the Earl of Biansha, Lu Pingyan, to come and fetch the bride. But he kept coming up with all kinds of excuses to decline. Isn\u2019t it on account of the Prince of Libei that he didn\u2019t dare to accept? The people from the Lu Clan are a bunch of blockheads! I\u2019ll have to see exactly what Libei can help them with in the future. As for Qi Zhuyin being the one to fetch the bride\u2026 As a girl and a daughter, her seniority is already a notch lower. The nerve of Qi Shiyu to think of it!\u201dThe Empress Dowager\u2019s anger had yet to subside when a eunuch swiftly trotted over and kneeled to say, \u201cGreetings to Your Majesty. Someone from the bedchamber had come earlier to say that His Majesty has woken up!\u201dLiuxiang hurriedly said, \u201cPrepare to set out!\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Tantai Hu, with his clothes draped over him, was carving wood to sculpt a crudely-made giant cricket for Ding Tao and Xiaowu. The moment Chen Yang lifted the curtain, all of them got off the couch and paid their proper respects in order.\u201cYou have only just woken up, so it\u2019s fine to sit.\u201d Xiao Chiye motioned for them to rise and took his seat on the chair. \u201cHow are you today?\u201d\u201cTo report back to the Viceroy.\u201d Tantai Hu wiped away the wood shavings on his hands. \u201cMy fever is gone, and I have eaten too. I can return to duty today.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry.\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s old robe dropped down deftly. He sat on the chair for a moment. \u201cYou got ill so suddenly that day. Your health is usually pretty good, so what happened? What did the military medic say?\u201d\u201cThe medic can\u2019t explain the cause of this illness either.\u201d Tantai Hu said. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering. Why me? I never caught a cold even when I trained bare-chested in the rain during all those times our\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0trained on the military drill grounds. I\u2019ve seen the name list of those who had fallen ill that the Viceroy had told Chen Yang to compile. Although there are also elderly and youngsters, it\u2019s still mostly the young and strong.\u201d\u201cThis epidemic is bizarre.\u201d Chen Yang piped up when he heard to this point. \u201cHis Excellency the Judge may be right. It\u2019s not a natural disaster this time, but a man-made one.\u201dXiao Chiye leaned back to ponder it over and said, \u201cRegardless of which it is, so much time has passed since then. The clues are most likely already disposed of.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still not too bad since I\u2019m the one who fell ill.\u201d Tantai Hu was still filled with trepidation. \u201cIf Viceroy were the one who fell sick instead, then the patrols in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0would be in chaos!\u201dStartled, Xiao Chiye\u2019s hand, which had been stroking his thumb ring, stopped in place. He said nothing, and the others did not dare to interrupt his contemplation.\u201cThis didn\u2019t cross my mind before you said it.\u201d After a long while, Xiao Chiye let out a fearless smile. \u201cNever mind. It\u2019s a bad debt, no? Thankfully we have a backup plan. It\u2019s not all that worrisome. Take a good rest today. Who is taking care of those few children in your home these days?\u201dTantai Hu did not expect Xiao Chiye to remember the children. His eyes felt hot as he said, \u201cBefore coming in, I entrusted them to Chen Yang. He kept them in the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s office compound. With the brothers there to take care of them, they should not have to worry about food. It\u2019s all good.\u201d\u201cMost of the original households in the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0are locals from\u00a0Qudu. You guys are non-locals from beyond\u00a0Qudu\u00a0who were recruited to fill up the posts here. All of you have no houses and no wives, so it isn\u2019t easy for you to raise a few children. This time, you fell ill while digging ditches in the face of a disaster. Consider it a meritorious service. Chen Yang will report it to the Ministry of War for you to get a promotion at the start of spring. In the future, in addition to your monthly salary, the internal division of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0will also allocate you some child support funds from my personal account.\u201dAllocating the money from Xiao Chiye\u2019s personal account meant that the money was designated and withdrawn from Xiao Chiye\u2019s official salary\u2014it could be said to be money that Xiao Chiye gave him.Tantai Hu had already kneeled down on one knee when he heard this. He said, \u201cHow would that do? I\u2019m already very content that the Viceroy didn\u2019t boot me out and still kept me on duty!\u201d\u201cCredit where credit is due; you deserve it. I\u2019m giving it to you, so just take it.\u201d Xiao Chiye rose and said to Chen Yang, \u201cKeep a record of the soldiers who have dug the ditches this time and distribute money to them. The epidemic is no joke; everyone is risking their own lives here, so what is taking some money in the grand scheme of things? Let it be known that all promotions and assignments will be assessed according to one\u2019s merits and demerits in the future if this happens again. For people like\u00a0Laohu, I, Xiao Ce\u2019an, will take care of the whole family.\u201dThat bit of displeasure Tantai Hu had initially harbored had utterly vanished. It would not do for him to bring up the issue about Shen Zechuan again because of the kindness he had received. Xiao Chiye also took a look at those few from the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0who had fallen ill, and he did and said the same to them. Even the young ones like Ding Tao received a monetary reward.Shen Zechuan drank his medicine as he watched the bustling scene outside the window.Qian Tianya set up the fire basin and roasted a few potatoes. As he poked the fire, he said, \u201cSee how others have gotten a promotion and a windfall. Master, what about me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep it in mind for future reference.\u201d Shen Zechuan set aside the bowl.Qiao Tianya looked at the potatoes with undivided attention even as he said, \u201cXiao the Second is doing it right when it comes to managing his subordinates. He has really put in a lot of thought and effort to be able to consolidate the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0and turn it into his very own impenetrable defense in the span of just a few years.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising for him to put in a little thinking and effort into matters that concern his safety and security.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0is his newly sharpened blade. Naturally, the more smoothly he can wield it, the better. Tantai Hu is a high-ranking military officer he recruited from the outside into the\u00a0Imperial Army. If not properly managed, then this batch of people with Tantai Hu as the head will become the root of troubles.\u201d\u201cTiming and people\u2019s hearts are all essential and indispensable. He has just the perfect grasp on them all. He suppressed them and rewarded them, sorting them out until they are all submissive and obedient. Even the root of trouble has become a stabilizing force.\u00a05\u00a0Given Tantai Hu\u2019s disposition, even if someone were to bribe him with a thousand gold in the future, it\u2019ll be hard to shake his loyalty.\u201d Qiao Tianya peeled the potatoes and sighed. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve compared it this way\u2026 Master, you\u2019re really way too cold-blooded.\u201d\u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0differ from the\u00a0Imperial Army. All those in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are men from noble clans. Each of them is ambitious and arrogant. Being cold is just perfect. Without any life and death tribulations, there is no way true friendships can form. Everyone has a scale in their heart. Han Cheng has assumed the post of Commander-in-chief for quite a few days, and there have been quite a number of rewards he has made out as a bribe to those below him. But how many of them really think well of him in private?\u201d Shen Zechuan paused for a moment, then continued, \u201cNow that you have eaten the potatoes, don\u2019t eat the meat later. You must have put on at least seven or eight\u00a0jin6\u00a0ever since you followed me.\u201dQiao Tianya said, \u201cDoes Master want to listen to a tune? I can play and even sing. I can skip the money, but you can at least reward me with two pieces of meat, right?\u201dShen Zechuan said mercilessly, \u201cGo out.\u201dAt the same time Qiao Tianya went out, Xiao Chiye returned. Qiao Tianya moved to the side to make way, and Xiao Chiye strode through the door, hooked a chair over with his leg, and sat beside the bed.\u201cDid you have a good sleep?\u201dShen Zechuan replied, \u201cSo-so.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cThat residence of yours has been torn down too. Where are you going to live after you get out two days later?\u201dShen Zechuan sighed. \u201cLive on the streets, I guess.\u201dPropping himself up, Xiao Chiye whistled at him and said, \u201cI have a small courtyard behind the Plum Blossom Residence. Do you want it?\u201d\u201cToo close together, and it\u2019ll be easy to arouse the suspicions of the others.\u201d Shen Zechuan gathered his clothes around him, offering a brief glimpse of the marks on his nape.\u201cToo far apart, and it\u2019ll be hard for us to even meet once every few days.\u201d Xiao Chiye reached out his hand to smooth down Shen Zechuan\u2019s back collar. His eyes lingered on those teeth marks.He was the one who left those marks, kissing that portion all over as if he was holding his prey in his mouth.Shen Zechuan raised his eyes to look at him and said, \u201cSee you on the imperial court\u2026 hm?\u201dXiao Chiye averted his gaze and said, \u201cThat sounds so distant.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s to be done?\u201d Shen Zechuan looked at him. \u201cWhere\u2019s my fan?\u201dChen Yang just happened to be holding a tray as he lifted the curtain. Without even thinking about it, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cGone. Chen Yang lost it.\u201dShen Zechuan looked towards Chen Yang who, despite his shock, nodded calmly and said to Shen Zechuan in a heavy voice, \u201cYour Excellency, this humble subordinate\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a fan. This Second Young Master will compensate you on his behalf.\u201d Xiao Chiye said leisurely. \u201cThat ivory fan is so crude. I\u2019ll gift you one.\u201d\u201cEven if it\u2019s crude, it\u2019s from Xi Hongxuan.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cHow can I put on an act of a crude rascal if I go and meet him later without that fan?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give something even more crude.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cInlaid with gold along with jade. This Second Young Master has lots of money.\u201d\u201cThe military drill ground on Mount Feng has to undergo renovations at the start of spring.\u201d Shen Zechuan spread his palms open. \u201cSecond Master Xiao, have you tightened your belt? You\u2019ll soon be so poor that you\u2019ll have to go vegetarian. Where on earth would you have the money to inlay gold and jade?\u201dChen Yang put the tray down and backed out of the room.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cWhat? Is this going to be a check of my $ecret $tash?\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cYo, there\u2019s even a $ecret $tash.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cI\u2019ve plenty of those.\u201dShen Zechuan smiled and said, \u201cThen that\u2019s really\u2026\u201dChen Yang, who had just exited, turned back and said outside the curtain, \u201cMaster! An imperial edict has arrived from the palace.\u201dBoth men reined in their expression. Xiao Chiye immediately rose and single-handedly brought Shen Zechuan up as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 : Temple ReopeningAs it was with haste that Zhao Zui Temple received the imperial edict, Xiao Chiye and Shen Zechuan were both not wearing their official robes. Everyone gathered in the courtyard and kneeled. The eunuch who had come to deliver the edict looked unfamiliar. Not daring to put on airs, he quickly started to read out the imperial edict when he saw the person it was intended for emerge.The eunuch finished reading the imperial edict and bowed slightly, saying to Xiao Chiye, \u201cViceroy, please rise quickly!\u201dXiao Chiye received the imperial edict, and Chen Yang immediately called for someone to brew and serve tea.\u201cZhao Zui Temple is pervaded with the stench of illness all over,\u201d Xiao Chiye said, 'so I won\u2019t invite\u00a0gonggong\u00a0inside for a seat today.\u201d\u201cThe Viceroy has been hard at work attending to official duties and has gone without rest for days. It\u2019s the Viceroy who should be the one invited to take a seat first.\u201d The eunuch merrily took a few sips of the tea, then furrowed his brows and sighed, \u201cHow is this tea fit for distinguished men? Viceroy, now that His Majesty is awake, then according to the Secretariat Elder, His Excellency the Judge and you may take a rest.\u201d\u201cThere are still people under the awning who are still down with the disease. I\u2019m on official duty, no? I wouldn\u2019t dare to be careless.\u201d Xiao Chiye put on a relaxed expression as he acquainted himself with eunuch over a few exchanges of pleasantries. Both of them stood in the courtyard, drinking tea as they chatted and laughed. Xiao Chiye asked, \u201cDid His Majesty regain consciousness today?\u201dThe eunuch, named Fuman, replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right. He just woke up this morning. All the\u00a0niangniang\u00a0in the palace are weeping tears of joy. Her Majesty personally instructed the Imperial Academy of Medicine to take good care of him.\u201dEverything mentioned in this imperial edict was merely formalities. They simply commended the\u00a0Imperial Army,\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, and the Ministry of Revenue Secretary for their quick actions and timely defenses this time round. But details of their rewards were only briefly mentioned in passing.Fuman had only just assumed office, and he usually served in the Grand Secretariat compound. The Grand Secretariat officials held eunuchs in contempt, and Hai Liangyi, in particular, loathed eunuchs. So whenever Fuman was on duty before, he could not look at Hai Liangyi right in the face; he had to retreat to the side and kneel down to reply. Whatever Hai Liangyi asked him, he would answer the same. He did not dare to jest and clown around, much less grin or beam. Now, he had not only received a cup of hot tea here; he also saw how Viceroy Xiao was a man who was naturally carefree and not bothered about trifles. Thus, he gradually relaxed as they conversed, intending to do Xiao Chiye a favor and use this chance to cotton up to the latter.\u201cThis humble slave has been going around the Grand Secretariat these days to serve the Secretariat Elder tea, and so this humble slave has more or less come to hear some rumors about the Viceroy.\u201d Fuman shifted two steps over and said in a hushed tone.Without a change in expression, Xiao Chiye lifted his hand to motion for the others to back off. With his arm around Fuman\u2019s shoulders, he said, \u201cThen you\u2019re the new favorite close to the Secretariat Elder. I myself have to watch the sky for the weather before I act and make wild guesses as to which impending storm is brewing. Perhaps\u00a0gonggong\u00a0can give me a pointer or two?\u201dFuman hurriedly said, \u201cI would not presume to be worthy of giving pointers. For the sake of the sovereign and people, the Viceroy carries out his official duties with conscience; the Secretariat Elder knows this too. The Grand Secretariat has also deliberated for a few days over the conferment of award this time. It\u2019s nothing bad. All the Viceroy has to do is to wait for it!\u201dXiao Chiye merely smiled, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare to hanker after the credits this time. The situation isn\u2019t something I alone can get back to normal. I\u2019d feel uneasy if the reward is too much.\u201d\u201cOh, my. Viceroy!\u201d Fuman slapped his leg. \u201cYou\u2019re too humble. Is Shen Zechuan the one from the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0who is in charge of the mission?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cHe\u2019s a frosty one.\u201dHaving heard that they were on bad terms, Fuman promptly laughed and said, \u201cWho would have known that the Viceroy would get together with him this time? Since the matter has been handled, then he is bound to receive a reward too. But he serves in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, so how is he going to be rewarded? The Grand Secretariat can\u2019t overstep their authority.1\u00a0\u00a0It all depends on His Majesty\u2019s intent.\u201d\u201cAn exception was made for him when he was promoted to the position of Southern Judge before the new year. It\u2019s too fast for him to be conferred another reward again now.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cThe Grand Secretariat didn\u2019t object?\u201dFuman carefully set the teacup aside and said, \u201cThe Viceroy is sick and tired of him, so naturally you take note of him. But now, the various Excellencies in the Grand Secretariat are all busy with other matters. If he were to be promoted for real, no one would dare to contradict and rebuff His Majesty over such a small matter like this. His Majesty has met with misfortune one after another. Even Secretariat Elder Hai would acquiesce to him at this point in time. But let this humble servant tell the Viceroy something in strict confidence. This man, if promoted too quickly, will be a latent danger. The current officials of fifth-grade and above in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are all lads that come from families with a long history and deep roots. That Shen Zechuan\u2026 who would think well of that family background of his? Head to the streets now and yell out Shen Wei\u2019s name at the top of your voice, and all you will get is countless spittle of saliva. His promotion to the top will only make these people humiliate him in public and in private. Someone who has many merits to his name and has received rewards for them will only cause the others to be jealous of him. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are, to begin with, a behemoth that is as ferocious as beasts of prey like the wolves and tigers. If he wants to hold on to his prize, it will still have to depend on his capabilities!\u201dXiao Chiye chatted a little more with Fuman before getting Chen Yang to see him out. When Chen Yang saw him out, he gave Fuman a hand and helped him up. It was only when Fuman got onto the horse and was midway through his journey that he felt a heaviness in his sleeve. He fished it out for a look and instantly beamed with delight.\u201cThe Viceroy is generous.\u201d Fuman stuffed the money back into his sleeve. \u201cA man worthy of being a friend.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan met Liang Cuishan and listened to him give a clear tally of the accounts. He asked him a few questions, and the latter could answer them all readily and methodically. It was really a shame for this person to be a minor, unranked2\u00a0official.Shen Zechuan said, \u201cThese few days have been chaotic. There are countless small and big medicinal shops in\u00a0Qudu, and the coming and going of the medicinal herbs is a complicated mess. You have certainly gone to great trouble to have recorded it all this clearly.\u201d\u201cThis is what this humble subordinate does in his official capacity. This is my duty. It\u2019s what I should do.\u201d Liang Cuishan said with concern, \u201cYour Excellency looks better today.\u201d\u201cThe illness is eradicated once the medicine takes effect. I\u2019m fine now.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cMake copies of this account and leave one for the Ministry of Revenue; you have to report back to the higher-ups. Then give the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0a copy so that they know what to expect.\u201dEveryone was on tenterhooks with the epidemic spreading a few days ago, so they could set aside all old grudges and hatred. But now that the rain has stopped, it was time to decide on the awards on the basis of each man\u2019s merit. With three parties all involved in this matter, it was hard to guarantee that there would be no mutual denunciation and backstabbing among them.As a minor official at the lower ranks, Liang Cuishan had seen a lot. He initially thought that Shen Zechuan did not get along with the\u00a0Imperial Army, so at present, Shen Zechuan should be strangling the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0until he went red in the face. But unexpectedly enough, Shen Zechuan did not step forward, nor did he speak up on the matter. Even with the job done, he did not hog all the credit for himself.Liang Cuishan hesitated for a moment before he decided to say, \u201cIt was Your Excellency who instructed this humble subordinate to record these accounts. For me to hand it over like this\u2026\u201d\u201cI was in a muddle while I was ill. You did many of the stuff on your own.\u201d Shen Zechuan closed the book. \u201cI can see that you\u2019re methodical when it comes to your work, and you\u2019ve served in the Ministry of Revenue for so many years. So why are you still just a desk clerk?\u201dLiang Cuishan seemed to have a hunch and said in a pained voice, \u201cThis humble subordinate has served in the Ministry of Revenue, starting from the second year of Xiande. At that time, the one in authority up there is a member of the Hua Clan. This humble subordinate is embarrassingly short on money, and I only know how to run errands. I don\u2019t have the money to grease the higher-up\u2019s palm. The higher-up let me attend to official duties in my original post, and my evaluations all these years have been in the lower-middle range, with neither merits nor demerits.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cHis Majesty is now opening up opportunities to air one\u2019s views, and the Six Ministries are lacking in talents. There\u2019s no need for you to feel disheartened. The opportunity will present itself when it is due.\u201dKnowing from this that Shen Zechuan meant to recommend him for a promotion, Liang Cuishan hurriedly bowed to him and said, \u201cYour Excellency\u2019s recognition and appreciation of this humble subordinate is a kindness this humble subordinate will never forget!\u201dShen Zechuan got up and said nothing further as he lifted the curtain and stepped out. Liang Cuishan looked at the floor blankly, only realizing after a while that the tears were already streaming down his cheeks.What he did not tell Shen Zechuan was that he was from Juexi, and his first few decades were spent on a prolonged period of studying; as such, he passed the imperial examinations a few years late. At first, he was supposed to assume duty at the Ministry of Personnel, but someone spent bribe money to take his place. He was then transferred to the Ministry of Works, where he received outstanding evaluations for the few years he worked there. As he was good in calculation, he was once again transferred to the Ministry of Revenue. He initially thought he could show and put his skills to good use at the Ministry of Revenue. But in the end, he was oppressed from above by a distantly related descendant of the Hua Clan\u2014an utter disgrace who simply muddled his way through. He was the one who did the job, but it was this higher-up\u2019s name on the reports that were submitted to the top. He tried to seek help from his connections to get a transfer elsewhere, but those at the top did not agree, wanting to exploit him as a manual laborer for free. He was suppressed and oppressed again and again until he eventually became a clerk in an official post so minor that he could not even be considered a legit official.He initially thought that he had to give up his dreams of glory in this life, disillusioned as he was with worldly affairs.3\u00a0Who would have expected that misfortune could turn out to be a blessing in disguise? Every cloud indeed has a silver lining.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8It was only two days later that the order forbidding access in and out of the palace was lifted. The operations of the Six Ministries reverted back to normal, and Zhao Zui Temple withdrew the men. Those who had yet to recover were all left under the continued care of the Imperial Academy of Medicine.Shen Zechuan was all clean as he stood before the door, once again all decked out in his embroidered python robe4\u00a0and phoenix-tail belt5\u00a0with his waist token hanging on his waist and sword by his side. Xiao Chiye had also tidied himself up, dressed in a scarlet court robe with an embroidered lion rank badge,6\u00a0looking tall and leggy.Both men put on a hypocritical show of bidding each other farewell.\u201cI\u2019m heading this way.\u201d Xiao Chiye whistled to summon over\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin. He patted his horse on the back. \u201cIs Your Excellency the Judge entering the palace with me?\u201d\u201cPlease go ahead first, Viceroy.\u201d Shen Zechuan said politely. \u201cThis humble subordinate has to go to the commander-in-chief to make a report.\u201d\u201cIt sucks to be a subordinate.\u201d Xiao Chiye flipped atop his horse. \u201cWhen are you coming up to play?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid of heights.\u201d Shen Zechuan looked up at him. \u201cYou\u2019d do best to sit tight.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too complicated and cumbersome to deal with the aftermath. Whether I can sit tight depends on whether you are willing to show mercy.\u201d Xiao Chiye pointed and tapped at his own chest with the horsewhip. \u201cBe gentle.\u201dBoth of them parted before Zhao Zui Temple. Instead of going to look for Han Cheng immediately, Shen Zechuan drove the carriage to the place where he had Ji Gang and Qi Huilian settled down.This little building was surrounded by a courtyard, with a half-dead pear tree jutting out from the top of the wall. Shen Zechuan entered, passed through the courtyard, and headed up the stairs, only to see the main hall doors tightly shut. There were no signs of Ji Gang or Qi Huilian.Qiao Tianya sensed the oddness in the atmosphere. He could see from the messy footprints on the ground that there were people here. Grasping the hilt of his blade with his palm, he strode a step forward and said with a smile, \u201cIs there no one here? If there isn\u2019t, this humble servant is going to draw his blade\u2014\u201dA sudden gust of wind sent the withered branches of the pear tree swaying, and weeds in the courtyard assaulted the hem of his robe. Qiao Tianya surveyed the place with sharp eyes; he had already discovered that the place was teeming with people both inside and outside the courtyard.\u201cWhat blade are you going to draw? We are all acquaintances here.\u201d A rather weak and feeble voice rang out from inside the house. \u201cLanzhou, why aren\u2019t you saying a word?\u201dThe ruthlessness in Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes was dimly visible, yet he forced a laugh and said, \u201cSecond Young Master, have you recovered?\u201dXi Hongxuan was all wrapped up in fox fur inside the house. He had lost quite some weight, and he did not look too good. Holding up the teacup, he stared askance at the door and said gloomily, \u201cWould I dare to see you if I haven\u2019t recovered? My good brother, why didn\u2019t you tell me that you\u2019re hiding such a bigwig here?!\u201dShen Zechuan laughed out loud and raised his head to motion for Qiao Tianya to retreat. He abruptly pushed the door open, startling up the dust inside the room. An entire room of guards turned to look at him, each of their blades already drawn with glints of snowy-white light.Xi Hongxuan sat in the very middle, grasping the teacup.Showing no signs of fear, Shen Zechuan strode in and said, \u201cOne is a fool and the other, a looney. What kind of bigwig can they be? If you want them, then why don\u2019t you just tell me?\u201dXi Hongxuan could not bring himself to laugh. He said, \u201cIf Qi Huilian is no bigwig, then Hai Liangyi is no rarity either! Lanzhou. Oh, Lanzhou, you are truly a deep one to hide it all this while! To think the Grand Mentor of Yongyi taught and guided you personally. Haha! Is he banking on you to be the Emperor?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s already crazy.\u201d Shen Zechuan pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the dust at his own pace. He cast a glance at Xi Hongxuan. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of a madman?\u201d\u201cI am!\u201d Xi Hongxuan suddenly flung the teacup down. \u201cA madman taught a mad dog, whose bites caught me off guard and turned me into a bloody pulp!\u201dThe surrounding blades pressed in swiftly.Shen Zechuan smiled and said, \u201cThat makes no sense. If you want to kill me, at least let me die knowing why.\u201d\u201cDid you\u2026\u201d Xi Hongxuan said in a malevolent voice, \u201c\u2026 teamed up with Xiao the Second to screw me over?\u201dThe atmosphere in the room suddenly froze. Shadows fell upon the sides of Shen Zechuan\u2019s face. After a moment of silence, he suddenly smiled and braced himself against the edge of the table.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dShen Zechuan scrutinized Xi Hongxuan with darkness in his eyes as he said both contemptuously and wickedly,\u201cEven if I dare to say so, do you dare to believe the same?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 : TrapThe atmosphere was forbidding; it was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.With his hands on the chair handles for support, Xi Hongxuan reacted quickly in this heart-stopping atmosphere and said, \u201cObscuring truths with falsehoods. You are throwing out misleading traps again! Shen Zechuan, do you really think I won\u2019t dare to kill you?\u201d\u201cThe blade is already on my neck.\u201d Shen Zechuan turned his head to look askance at the blade. \u201cYou can just give the command to take down my head.\u201dXi Hongxuan did not dare to let up even the slightest. In this confrontation, he was not willing to miss any of the subtleties in Shen Zechuan\u2019s expression. Although he was sitting tight in the chair, he was even more anxious than Shen Zechuan deep down. Yet, the more he warned himself not to be influenced by Shen Zechuan, the more he would be spurred on by the expression in Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes and by his tone.\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, we are brothers.\u201d Xi Hongxuan said with a superficial, insincere smile. \u201cLanzhou, tell me the truth, and I\u2019ll leave your corpse in one piece.\u201d\u201cMuch ado about nothing. Feel free to do it.\u201d Shen Zechuan egged him on. \u201cCome on.\u201dXi Hongxuan\u2019s fingers dug tightly into the chair handles as he exchanged stares with Shen Zechuan. But Shen Zechuan was too calm and composed. Thus, Xi Hongxuan said, \u201cAren\u2019t you worried about Qi Huilian at all? Once you\u2019re dead, I\u2019ll skin that old dog and sell him out to the Empress Dowager to plead for leniency.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cIf you handed Qi Huilian to the Empress Dowager twenty years earlier, she might really pardon you for your negligence this time. But Qi Huilian is now worthless. He\u2019s not worth alive, and he\u2019s worth nothing dead. You are a veteran merchant; would you feel at ease to do such a losing deal? I think you\u2019re lost your mind and gone silly from the illness.\u201d\u201cQi Huilian is merely feigning insanity.\u201d Xi Hongxuan said. \u201cDo you think I can\u2019t tell? To survive, he tucks his tail between his legs and struggles on whilst at death\u2019s door. That\u2019s quite the convincing act he has put on!\u201dShen Zechuan sneered, \u201cAre you trying to sound me out at this point in time? He\u2019s just a lunatic.\u201d\u201cIf he is a lunatic, then who are you studying under?\u201d Xi Hongxuan stretched his neck out. \u201cZhao Zui Temple made you a new person. How did that last remaining survivor of the Shen Clan who was so much like a lapdog six years ago become so gutsy and resourceful, huh? Lanzhou, you tell me!\u201d\u201cMan proposes, Heaven disposes.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s expression was gloomy. \u201cDon\u2019t you know what it\u2019s like to be a lapdog at others\u2019 beck and call and have them kick you around? If I don\u2019t shed my skin, how can I break out of the hardships and make it out there? It\u2019s better to rely on oneself than on others. You and I are both fleeing for our lives from perilous circumstances, and yet we are now in internal strife. Xi Hongxuan, you sure are doing a good job getting rid of someone as soon as he outlives his usefulness, much like killing the donkey the moment it leaves the millstone.\u201d\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t leaked the news, then how would Ouhua Pavilion collapsed for no reason? We call ourselves brothers on the inside, but the moment you step out, you backstab me in the back. I can\u2019t be compared to you when it comes to being ruthless! But as fate would have it, I didn\u2019t die!\u201d Xi Hongxuan said in a chilling voice. \u201cYou want to ingratiate yourselves with both parties, but there\u2019s no such thing as having your cake and eating it too, is there?\u201d\u201cWhat can\u00a0Xiao\u2019er\u00a0give me that is worthy enough of raising your suspicions to such an extent?\u201d Shen Zechuan said sarcastically, \u201cHe\u2019s not Xiao Jiming; he can\u2019t be the Prince of Libei, nor can he command the Libei\u2019s Armored Cavalry. He\u2019s merely a trapped beast in this\u00a0Qudu! What\u2019s the difference between him and me? Whatever it is that he has, I have no lack of it either.\u201d\u201cHe has a good life that you don\u2019t have.\u201d Xi Hongxuan said. \u201cHe\u2019s the second son of the Prince of Libei, a legitimate lawful son from the direct line of descendants, born of the same mother who birthed Xiao Jiming. Even if he can\u2019t inherit the title and position of the Prince of Libei, he has tens of thousands of willing troops at his disposal. Aren\u2019t soldiers precisely what you\u2019re lacking?\u201dWith an indifferent expression, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cI hold a post in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards; why would I need troops for? It\u2019s only in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0that I have a way to survive. Leave\u00a0Qudu, and there is nowhere else I can put my abilities to use. I\u2019m the eighth commonson of Shen Wei, while you are the second lawful son of the Xi Clan. Have you and I ever had an easy time before? This shows that there\u2019s no difference between the sons of\u00a0lawful or common\u00a0ranks. When it comes to people, even heaven cannot reach a final verdict until the very end.\u201d\u201cBy speaking such treacherous words, you have already regarded the societal order of this world as nothing.\u201d Xi Hongxuan raised his finger and pointed to his own toe. \u201cBut you got to admit that some people are born to be masters as the continual successions of the upper echelons of the noble clans keep it going. This is fate! If there is no difference between those of common birth and lawful birth, then how can the bloodline maintain its legitimacy? He who is surnamed Li is just simply a cut above you with the surname Shen!\u201dShen Zechuan stared at Xi Hongxuan and roared with laughter. Insanity stirred once again in those expressive eyes as he said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right\u2026\u201dWhen Qiao Tianya saw the upsurge of Shen Zechuan\u2019s murderous intent in this split second, he almost thought that Shen Zechuan was going to draw his blade. He did not expect Shen Zechuan to say next in a genial tone, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then what future can I have by following\u00a0Xiao\u2019er? If you believe the rumors and lay a trap to kill me today., then you will come to regret it someday in the future.\u201dXi Hongxuan faltered, besieged by doubts and unable to come to a decision, but his expression betrayed nothing. He merely lowered his eyes and said, \u201cEven when faced with imminent death, you\u2019re still putting on an act! You came here as soon as you left Zhao Zui Temple. Isn\u2019t that proof enough that this place is important to you?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s emotions seemed to have sunk into a deep pool of waters, where there was not even a trace of a ripple to be seen. He said, \u201cThat is Qi Huilian you\u2019re talking about. Even though he has gone crazy, he is also the Qi Huilian who used to be the Triple Yuan Top Scholar,1\u00a0one which the crown prince of the eastern palace personally invited to take on a leading official post. Now that he\u2019s in my hands, I\u2019ll never hand him over to anyone else unless he\u2019s dead.\u201dShen Zechuan was right in his presumption that Xi Hongxuan was setting up a trap to deceive him. Xi Hongxuan had no idea at all if Qi Huilian was insane for real or just putting on an act. He merely wanted to pre-empt and catch Shen Zechuan off-guard. Although Xi Hongxuan did not have Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s capability, he had an ability one would find hard to surpass, and that was eloquence. The reason he was able to incite the Imperial College to rise in rebellion with just a single teahouse meeting was all because of his glib tongue. And this also happened to be his weak point.If he was really certain that Shen Zechuan and Xiao Chiye were setting up a trap to screw him over, then he would not give Shen Zechuan the chance to open his mouth. He dragged his sickly body here, because he could not be sure if Shen Zechuan was collaborating with Xiao Chiye. That was why he had to bring out his own special skill and engaged in a battle of words to trick Shen Zechuan into telling the truth.\u201cWhat do you want Qi Huilian for?\u201d Xi Hongxuan asked with dread and fear.Shen Zechuan suddenly hit upon an idea. Going along with it, he bent over and said to Xi Hongxuan, \u201cQi Huilian was the Crown Prince\u2019s teacher. There was the incident at the Eastern Palace back then, and I heard that there was an imperial grandson still in his infancy. Ji Lei did not reveal the imperial grandson\u2019s whereabouts to me before his death. I was afraid Qi Huilian knew, so I had to keep a close watch on him.\u201dXi Hongxuan\u2019s countenance changed in spite of himself. He said, \u201cThe Empress Dowager will never leave any survivors behind. It\u2019s common practice to stamp out trouble at its source! So what are you daydreaming about?!\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cIf there is no imperial heir in hand, who would dare to conspire to murder His Majesty? There will be nobody else with the surname Li in Dazhou if he dies. You aren\u2019t the one who did it, and it isn\u2019t me either. Instead of falling out with me here, why not put down your blade and discuss a countermeasure with me?\u201d\u201cHow would I know that it\u2019s not you?\u201d Xi Hongxuan did not move. \u201cNo one but you know the structure of Ouhua Pavilion best. It\u2019s simply too convenient for you to tamper with it. In addition, I keep encountering calamities one after another, yet you keep getting promoted again and again. Your meritorious deeds sure have grown!\u201d\u201cI have only just gotten into His Majesty\u2019s good graces. It\u2019s just the time for me to build up my strength and climb my way up. So why would I kill him? What\u2019s more, you and I have been conspiring together for quite some time, so why would\u00a0Xiao\u2019er\u00a0believe me based on some empty promises?\u201d Shen Zechuan gradually let out a smile at him. \u201cEven if I kill you, it should be at a time when there\u2019s much more in it for me.\u201dThe way he said it was half in jest, but it made the blood of those listening run cold. Xi Hongxuan covered his lips and coughed, using this interval to evade Shen Zechuan\u2019s gaze.Although they had conspired together to kill off many people, Xi Hongxuan still could not confront Shen Zechuan head-on. This was not a momentary fear, but fear accumulated over their course of acquaintanceship. He could not forget the way Ji Lei looked with his skin flayed. That was why he wanted to act quickly now that his suspicions were aroused.This man cannot live.Xi Hongxuan thought.Once the time was right, he had to kill him off no matter what! Such a man would certainly not let himself be used for Xi Hongxuan\u2019s own purposes. His talk about there being no differences between those of\u00a0lawful and common\u00a0birth had already revealed his lack of respect and reverence for the\u00a0Eight Great Clans. Everyone was attempting the impossible that ran against the interests of their opponents, much like bargaining with a tiger for its hide. And what they were competing against was who would be faster in the days to come.Xi Hongxuan secretly made up his mind. He smiled too and said, \u201cI\u2019m scaring you only because I myself was scared after being crushed in that pit. Lanzhou, you\u2019ll surely understand if you were the one lying in there. What are you people standing around there for? Put away your blades. Don\u2019t hurt His Excellency the Judge.\u201dThe surrounding blades returned to their sheaths, one after another. But Xi Hongxuan did not tell his men to withdraw from the room. Pulling at his fox fur, he said, \u201cEverything happened too suddenly these few days. With our communications cut off, it\u2019s inevitable that we would come to be mutually suspicious of one another. It\u2019s all good now that we\u2019ve cleared the air. Come, Lanzhou. Take your seat, and we\u2019ll talk.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cBlades and swords have no eyes. Second Young Master, next time, give me a warning first so that I can prepare for it and won\u2019t be as in such haste as I am today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable how you remain composed in the face of danger.\u201d Xi Hongxuan lifted the teapot to infuse tea. \u201cAs you know, what we are doing can cost us our heads. I was really forced into a corner this time; otherwise, how would I treat you in such a way? It\u2019s all because I was forced to! I got anxious seeing how Xiao the Second is going to be as pleased as punch riding the crest of success soon. Come, come. Take a seat quickly. Still holding it against me?\u201d\u201cI, with the surname Shen, am unworthy of being in high position.\u201d Shen Zechuan sized up the room. \u201cHow would I dare to sit next to you?Xi Hongxuan laughed out loud and said, \u201cThose are all bullshit! They are merely words spoken to disparage others. How can be you the same as the others? Take a seat.\u201dOnly then did Shen Zechuan take his seat.Xi Hongxuan held out the tea to him and said with an apologetic smile, \u201cIf you ask me, the surname Shen is really holding you back. Don\u2019t you think so? If you had been born in the Han Clan or the Fei Clan, there wouldn\u2019t be this much animosity between us, right? Lanzhou, please be appeased! Now tell me seriously. What are you keeping this Qi Huilian for?\u201dShen Zechuan touched his sleeve pocket before he remembered his ivory fan was lost. He said, \u201cThe old looney has been scared stiff by the Crown Prince\u2019s suicide where he slit his own throat. I ran into him all the time when I was in Zhao Zui Temple and heard some of his intermittent ravings, so I thought of keeping him just in case there\u2019s a future need.\u201d\u201cYou should have asked me about the matter regarding the imperial grandson.\u201d Xi Hongxuan brushed aside the tea foam. \u201cDon\u2019t think about this matter anymore. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d\u201cNot even a chance of it happening?\u201d Shen Zechuan turned the teacup around gently. He did not drink it.Xi Hongxuan drank the tea, grunted twice, and said, \u201cThat task was carried out together by Ji Lei and Shen Wei, both of whom were ruthless. Even the fair and beautiful Crown Princess was strangled to death by them, and you want to pin your hopes on them showing the imperial grandson mercy? What\u2019s more, they were the sworn enemies of the imperial grandson for killing his father. You think they had nothing better to do than to sow the seeds of future trouble for themselves?\u201d\u201cWas that what Xue Xiuzhuo said too?\u201dXi Hongxuan cast him a look and asked, \u201cWhy are you asking about Yanqing specifically?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re familiar with one another.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s gaze did not falter. \u201cYou\u2019re on good terms with him. Wasn\u2019t your promotion to the Bureau of Evaluations this time precisely because you listened to his advice?\u201d\u201cBoth of you are Zhuge Liang.2\u00a0I\u2019ll listen to whoever makes more sense.\u201d Xi Hongxuan kicked the ball back and said, \u201cThey said scholars look down on one another. Why are you smart people also mutually belittling each other?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s really not it.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cYou were transferred into the Bureau of Evaluations before the inspections, and subsequently, this red-hot assignment fell upon you. That would make others green with envy. It\u2019s hard to say that this wasn\u2019t the reason you were set up. Xue Xiuzhuo has been an official for quite some years, and he never thought of it? If he did, then why did he still persuade you to go?\u201dXi Hongxuan was drinking tea when his movement paused. He said, \u201cWho would have expected someone to really strike out at me? It\u2019s not Yanqing\u2019s fault.\u201d\u201cHe has rendered a meritorious service by protecting the Emperor at the Nanlin Hunting Grounds. Yet he knew to conceal his abilities and bide his time at that time and didn\u2019t go all out. Instead, he went to the Court of Judicial Review for more experience.\u201d Having said to this point, Shen Zechuan continued no further and merely smiled at Xi Hongxuan. \u201cI just find it strange.\u201dAs if he had not heard it, Xi Hongxuan smiled too, \u201cOh, my! This interruption almost made me forget about it. Lanzhou, now that I\u2019ve recovered and His Majesty has woken up, the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0will start to impeach me. Help me think of a way. I can\u2019t be transferred out of\u00a0Qudu.\u201d\u201cThe fault lies with His Majesty this time. But no one is blaming him. And the Ministry of Works and Ministry of Revenue are both shirking responsibilities and shifting the blame around. You happened to land right in the middle. Everyone will naturally target you.\u201d Shen Zechuan set aside the teacup. \u201cThis is a tough one to deal with.\u201d\u201cPan Xiangjie and Wei Huaigu,3\u00a0huh!\u201d Xi Hongxuan said. \u201cAt the end of it all, they just want money. Getting rebuked is really no big deal. They are only latching on to me because they wanted to take advantage of the situation to raise the price and make me fish out money to pay for the shortfall with my own money. How many people died this time? As long as His Majesty is fine, everything else can be bought.\u201d\u201cWithout tens of thousands of taels this time, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll be hard to settle.\u201d Shen Zechuan said with a smile.\u201cI have money.\u201d Xi Hongxuan set aside the teacup too and said, \u201cBut I\u2019m not willing to give it to them. I\u2019m at fault for accompanying His Majesty to the brothel. But the public ditches have nothing to do with me. I\u2019m not going to oblige if they want to slap unreasonable demands on me and use me as a scapegoat.\u201d\u201cAn official one grade higher can oppress an official one grade lower than him. Even if you are not in the wrong, it will still become your fault. Reasoning with them won\u2019t work, and it\u2019s pointless to leave the mess as it is.\u201d Shen Zechuan maintained his composure and said, \u201cStill a pain to deal with.\u201dXi Hongxuan said, \u201cIt\u2019s not hard. I\u2019m telling you, the Emperor\u2019s heart is with me. Even if they want to punish me severely, they still have to see what the Emperor thinks. We mustn\u2019t lose our heads before Xiao the Second has been dealt with. I am confident that His Majesty will definitely not be the same as he used to be after waking up this time.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 : Noble Rank AdvancementXi Hongxuan spoke with such certainty that Shen Zechuan just had to look askance at him. But Xi Hongxuan was not willing to continue discussing further and merely said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a proper place to stay now, so it\u2019s not convenient to keep Qi Huilian around. Why not leave him with me?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t appropriate to leave a raving looney at your place either.\u201d Shen Zechuan said calmly. \u201cWhat do you want him for?\u201d\u201cIn my opinion.\u201d Xi Hongxuan held out his hand flat, like a hand blade. \u201cThe best option would be to finish him off. It\u2019s inadvisable to get yourself involved with all those old affairs. The more you know, the worse it\u2019ll be for you.\u201d Xi Hongxuan brandished his hand and looked at Shen Zechuan. \u201cOr are you unwilling to?\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cOf course I\u2019m unwilling to. He\u2019s an old minister during the reign of Yongyi. He knows Shen Wei well. I have a use for keeping him alive.\u201dIf Shen Zechuan had agreed readily, Xi Hongxuan would not have believed him easily. So he said it with seventy percent truth and thirty percent falsehood to throw Xi Hongxuan off.As expected, Xi Hongxuan made no further mention of killing him. He said, \u201cAre you still thinking of investigating Shen Wei\u2019s case? You should have said so earlier. Lanzhou, do you have to go so far as to hide this bit of matter from me?\u201d\u201cWhen have I ever hidden it from you?\u201d Shen Zechuan smiled as he lifted the teapot and poured tea for Xi Hongxuan. \u201cIsn\u2019t this matter obvious? As long as Shen Wei remains guilty, I\u2019ll never be able to live honorably.\u201d\u201cThe evidence against him is conclusive, and his infamy has already been deeply impressed on everyone\u2019s mind. Even if the charge against him is dropped, it will not be enough to convince the masses.\u201d Xi Hongxuan said, \u201cA felony like selling his country to seek personal glory is something that can never be scrubbed clean, even over several lifetimes. Plus, it\u2019s pointless to just rely on the imperial court\u2019s pardon alone. There are many kinds of rumors in this world. He, Shen Wei, has already been crucified to death under the spray of spittle. Poor you. I can only advise you to forget about this matter. It\u2019s not something you\u2019ll be able to clear up!\u201dShen Zechuan silently set down the teapot.Seeing the atmosphere growing heavier, Xi Hongxuan continued, \u201cYou are already now an Imperial Bodyguard of fifth grade, and you still take those rumors and slanders to heart? Please don\u2019t. Look ahead. You\u2019ve done a good job on this mission, so you should be getting a promotion, yes?\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cNothing is confirmed yet. I haven\u2019t even settled down in my post of Southern Judge. Charging all the way up to the top isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing.\u201d\u201cThis time, you and I have to act carefully. We are really gambling with our lives here.\u201d Xi Hongxuan tucked his fox fur properly and said, \u201cWe have to investigate and get to the bottom of this matter. The other party is hiding in the dark, while we are out there exposed in the open. If we can\u2019t get to the bottom of the matter, then it would be hard to guard against the enemy. I\u2019m the one who got crushed this time. But what about the next time? You should watch out too. It\u2019s inconvenient for me to stay for long here today. Lanzhou, I\u2019ll see you at the residence in a few days.\u201dSaying so, Xi Hongxuan rose to his feet and surveyed the surroundings again.\u201cThis courtyard seems decent to me. If you don\u2019t have enough money, just let me know. Just don\u2019t take what happened today to heart, alright?\u201dWith that, Xi Hongxuan smiled. Shen Zechuan smiled too. Both of them reconciled, as if there was no ill-feeling between them, as if what happened earlier was merely just them horsing around with one another.Qiao Tianya sent Xi Hongxuan off. As soon as he returned to the courtyard, he saw Shen Zechuan standing with his back to him and with his face facing the main hall. He was wiping his hands with a handkerchief.The setting sun outside the courtyard crossed over, casting a scarlet red hue over Shen Zechuan\u2019s embroidered python robe. His slightly lowered neck was as fair as jade. He wiped those slender, flawless fingers, which were clearly clean, yet he seemed to detest them to bits.\u201cIs he gone?\u201d Shen Zechuan turned his head aside to ask.\u201cI saw him get on the horse carriage.\u201d Qiao Tianya stopped a short distance away from Shen Zechuan. He did not move forward, but bent over to pick up a fallen leaf on the ground that had been trampled and scrutinized it for a moment. \u201cThe men he hired are all masters from the\u00a0martial fraternity, yet a fight didn\u2019t break out. Most likely, Ji Gang-shifu\u00a0was on his guard, and the Grand Mentor did not resist.\u201d\u201cShifu\u00a0burned his face with fire to ruin his looks, all to conceal his identity and live incognito. Not starting a fight hastily is a wise move.\u201d Shen Zechuan neatly folded that blue handkerchief. \u201cTeacher mustn\u2019t remain in Xi Hongxuan\u2019s hands for too long. We need to think of a way.\u201dQiao Tianya crushed the leaf without disrupting Shen Zechuan\u2019s contemplation. Shen Zechuan suddenly turned around and was dazzled by the sunset glow. But he did not flinch or hide from it as he looked towards that towering and majestic palace.\u201cLegitimate bloodline\u2026\u201d Shen Zechuan murmured and asked Qiao Tianya. \u201cWho\u2019s living there?\u201dQiao Tianya followed his gaze and looked over as well. He replied, \u201cThe Li Clan.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes were cold and indifferent as he said with a mocking smile, \u201cIt\u2019s a deer\u2014If Zhou lost its deer, the heroes of the world may all pursue it.1\u00a0Today, you say it\u2019s the Li Clan. Tomorrow, I can also say it\u2019s some random person on the street. Whoever can step onto that dragon throne at the peak will be the legitimate, rightful one.\u201dQiao Tianya prided himself on being a nonconformist with an unconventional, rebellious streak, but even he did not expect Shen Zechuan to have the audacity to say such words. In his astonishment, he took a few steps back and looked out into the distance at the palace. He said, \u201cSuch rebellious words are tantamount to having no respect for the law.\u201d\u201cYou know there are countless gentlemen in this world, all of them good men with unyielding steadfastness and unfailing loyalty.\u201d Shen Zechuan kept the handkerchief back into his sleeve and said, \u201cThe Earl of Biansha, Lu Pingyan, is known as the \u2018Wolf and Tiger of the Border Town\u2019. To protect and hold on to Bianjun Commandery, he has given away all his family fortunes. Although he has received a noble title conferred by the emperor, all he eats every day are pickled vegetables and sweet potatoes. Subsequently, Lu Guangbai becomes hard-pressed for military funds whenever there is a war. And because Lu Guangbai is not on good terms with the\u00a0Eight Great Clans, he has never been conferred a noble title despite all his outstanding and illustrious military achievements. So tell me, is it that satisfying to be such a gentleman and loyal official?\u201d\u201cAsk your conscience first before we talk about satisfaction. To be an outspoken and candid minister, you have to sacrifice the self and give up your selfish desires.2\u00a0Suotian Pass\u2019s Feng Yisheng\u2019s entire family of loyal heroes died martyrs in battles. This is what we call the epitome of righteousness.\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s insanity, which he had suppressed earlier, swept over him again. He stood up and burst out laughing, saying, \u201cQiao Tianya, you are not a nonconformist who has deviated from the norms at all. You are a prisoner of the norms. You are one who can be a gentleman.\u201dQiao Tianya said, \u201cMaster\u2014\u201dThe sunset glow on the horizon faded into night, and darkness came shrouding all over. The pear tree bared its withered branches and brandished them threateningly, casting shadows over Shen Zechuan\u2019s raised face.\u201cBut, in this world, someone has to be the traitor and the rebel. I don\u2019t believe that fate is decided by the Heavens. If there\u2019s a blade held against my neck someday in the future, I will not show mercy even if it\u2019s Li Jianheng, let alone Xi Hongxuan. The bloodline legitimacy Xi Hongxuan speaks of is no different from the nonsensical ravings of a fool. Anyone will die when a blade slices across their necks; there\u2019s no exception regardless of whether one is a di born of the legitimate wife or a shu born of a concubine.\u201dIn the cold, dreary night, the crow of dusk let out a few mournful caws. Shen Zechuan looked back at Qiao Tianya.\u201cMy ambition is not to be a gentleman, nor is it to be a good person. Since vindictiveness has become the tenet I live by, then a kindness given is kindness given, a wrong done is a wrong done. I want Xi Hongxuan to pay with his life for what happened today.\u201dThe wind assailed the scattered clouds and scraped the remaining leaf off the tip of the branch.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8The impeachments from the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0came bearing down upon them in torrents. Xi Hongxuan, Pan Xiangjie, Wei Huaixing, and even Hai Liangyi were all censured one after another. Cen Yu took charge as the chief commentator as the few parties attacked one another on the imperial court.Having just woke up, Li Jianheng hardly said much these days and simply let them argue among themselves as he held court in Mingli Hall.Hai Liangyi was already in ill health before the epidemic happened, and lately he looked even more emaciated. Not once had he had the moment to rest, and now, listening to the Ministry of Works and the Ministry of Revenue starting an argument again, he could not help but let out a few violent coughs.Li Jianheng hurriedly said, \u201cSecretariat Elder, there\u2019s no need to rise. If you have something to say, you may voice it out while seated.\u201dHai Liangyi bowed his thanks and covered his mouth with a handkerchief. After his coughing eased up a little, he said, \u201cThe Grand Secretariat has already submitted the clauses for rewards and punishments this time to His Majesty\u2019s table yesterday. If Your Majesty finds any part inappropriate after looking through it, you may reject it and let the Grand Secretariat discuss it again.\u201dLi Jianheng had been absent-minded, and Hai Liangyi originally thought that he would hem and haw. He did not expect him to say after a moment\u2019s pause, \u201cI\u2019ve seen it. And there are indeed some parts I don\u2019t understand and would like to ask of the Secretariat Elder to clear my doubts.\u201dThe entire hall of officials was dumbfounded the moment the words left his mouth.Li Jianheng opened the memorial and said, \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0has done a meritorious service by dredging up the public ditches. Xiao Chiye is already a second-grade Viceroy of the\u00a0Imperial Army. Just the reward of some gold and jades is simply too meager.\u201dHai Liangyi answered, \u201cThe military drill ground on Mount Feng is undergoing an expansion this year, and the money will be arranged for by the Ministry of Revenue. This could be said to be a waiver of his biggest expenditure this year. This humble subject feels that the reward cannot be too excessive; this is sufficient enough.\u201dLi Jianheng said, \u201cBut the deployment of medicinal herbs, quarantine of the patients, and dredging of the public ditches are no small matter. He has done a great job with them all.\u201dHai Liangyi pondered it over and said, \u201cIt\u2019s true that he has rendered meritorious service. But these matters are not something the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0can achieve on its own. If he\u2019s shown too much special favor\u2014\u201d\u201cI want to advance his noble rank.\u201d Li Jianheng closed the memorial and looked at Hai Liangyi. \u201cHe\u2019s the second son of lawful birth of the Prince of Libei. If he had gone into battle and slain the enemies, then he should have a noble rank and title by now.\u201dHai Liangyi did not answer immediately.Li Jianheng said, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about these issues the few days I was confined to my sickbed. I wish to confer the title of \u2018Marquis of Dingdu\u2019 upon Xiao Chiye. What does the Secretariat Elder think?\u201dHai Liangyi said, \u201cYou mustn\u2019t, Your Majesty. Unless it\u2019s military achievements, one cannot be conferred a noble title. Although Xiao Chiye has made great contributions this time, it\u2019s far from the point where he can be made a marquis. The Lu Clan of Qidong\u2019s Bianjun Commandery has numerous military achievements to their name. Yet, only the old General Lu Pingyan is currently conferred with the title of the Earl of Biansha. Firstly, Xiao Chiye has not stabilized the borders, and secondly, he has not driven out the enemies. I fear it will only be hard to convince the public if you make him a marquis out of the blue.\u201d\u201cTo begin with, he has done a meritorious service by protecting me at the Nanlin Hunting Grounds, and he has, yet again, shown no fear in the face of danger this time. It\u2019s a good thing the epidemic did not spread. This matter concerns the peace and stability of\u00a0Qudu; is this still not considered a merit? The Earl of Biansha, Lu Pingyan, has transferred the garrison troops of Bianjun Commandery in private numerous times. The reason his noble rank has not advanced is merely because his merits are offset by his demerits and vice versa.\u201d As Li Jianheng spoke, his eyes reddened. He covered his face and choked with sobs. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me my life is nothing worth mentioning either? The purpose of bestowing the title of marquis upon him is to commend and honor him. There will be no increment of the numbers of soldiers in the\u00a0Imperial Army, and no establishments of private rights. It\u2019s just a title in name only. Is this not even acceptable, either?\u201dWei Huaigu initially meant to impeach Xiao Chiye for privately deploying the medicinal herbs without authorization, but seeing that the situation was not favorable for his cause, he changed his mind and said, \u201cWhat Your Majesty thinks is reasonable. Xiao Chiye\u2019s decisiveness and fearlessness in times of danger should be commended and rewarded. But what the Secretariat Elder says is true, too. In this humble subject\u2019s opinion, why not honor Xiao Chiye with the title \u2018Earl of Dingdu\u2019 first?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Hai Liangyi would not budge. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no logic in doing so. Your Majesty, if you grant Xiao Chiye a title today, then you will greatly disappoint the Old General at the frontier. It\u2019s an established rule of the imperial court that a noble title cannot be conferred on one without military achievements to his name.\u201dLi Jianheng said, \u201cHow about we first promote Lu Pingyan to a marquis, then confer the title of Earl upon Xiao Chiye? Does the Secretariat still not agree to this?\u201dHe spoke of conferment as if it was child\u2019s play.Hai Liangyi\u2019s coughing intensified. He wanted to say something further, but Pan Xiangjie beat him to it. He said in a fluster, \u201cThis humble subject thinks it\u2019s a good thing. This would be Your Majesty\u2019s first conferment since Your Majesty\u2019s ascension to the throne. It\u2019s a special honor. Secretariat Elder, one mustn\u2019t be a stickler for conventions on every single matter. Now that he has indeed made a contribution, what\u2019s the issue with making an exception?\u201dSeeing the noble clans unanimously urging Li Jianheng, Kong Qiu could not help but kowtow and said, \u201cThis humble subject thinks the Secretariat Elder is right. Your Majesty, Lu Pingyan has spared no effort to defend the Bianjun Commandery. Even if he\u2019s to be conferred a title, it shouldn\u2019t be done in such a hasty and sloppy\u2014\u201d\u201cHasty? I\u2019ve been repeatedly asking the opinions of all of you here, and yet you still say I\u2019m hasty!\u201d With a fling of his sleeves, Li Jianheng rose to his feet and pointed at Kong Qiu, saying, \u201cI can see that you are always going along with the Secretariat Elder\u2019s words on the imperial court. The sovereign and his ministers. Exactly who is your sovereign, and whose minister are you?!\u201dThe various ministers all kneeled and said in unison, \u201cYour Majesty, please be appeased!\u201dKong Qiu immediately said, \u201cYour Majesty is the sovereign of this humble subject, and this humble subject does his Majesty\u2019s bidding! But it\u2019s indeed inappropriate to bypass the regulations and go ahead with the conferment!\u201d\u201cI\u00a0am\u00a0going to confer the title upon him!\u201d Li Jianheng wept as he said, \u201cEach time I met with calamity one after the other, it was only with Ce\u2019an\u2019s help that I could avert disaster and escape unscathed. Even when I want to bestow a title upon him, you people have to turn me down and throw obstructions in my way! The Secretariat Elder has the final say over all the matters in this imperial court, so why not let the Secretariat Elder sit on this throne instead?!\u201dThese words truly struck Hai Liangyi where it hurts! Unstable on his knees, Hai Liangyi covered his lips and coughed violently. He never met with officials outside the court and the capital, and he had never held any private feasts. In order not to get involved in a faction or clique, he worked hard day and night. And he taught and guided Li Jianheng with utmost care, all because he feared getting slandered and stabbed in the back. He was the most trustworthy minister, a right-handed man of the emperor, not a tyrannical official in power!Seeing Hai Liangyi coughing until he was all hunched over, Li Jianheng did not dare to create a scene further and got someone to help Hai Liangyi up. Nevertheless, he still said, \u201cNo matter what, Xiao Chiye shall be conferred a title!\u201dWith the commotion in Mingli Hall, the imperial edict was issued a few days later. Like a bolt of thunder out of the blue, it caused a startled wave of memorials flooding in from all over.Lu Guangbai brought his father to receive the imperial edict at the Bianjun Commandery. Lu Pingyan was promoted to the rank of marquis. Even he himself was at a loss how to react in the very moment he held the edict in his hands.The Lu Clan had buried generation after generation of its people in this yellow sand. In his heyday, Lu Pingyan was also known as the \u2018Wolf and Tiger of the Border Town\u2019. He was renowned for his military exploits, along with Xiao Fangxu and Qi Shiyu. And now, injured and sick all over \u2013 and before he retired from active duty to take up an advisory post \u2013 he finally received his reward. Yet, it was all to pave the way for a junior of the younger generation.Xiao Chiye was originally sleeping in his residence when he heard of the arrival of the imperial edict; thus he put on his clothes and came out to receive it.After reading the imperial edict, Fuman beamed and moved to help him up, only to see a pale-looking Xiao Chiye who looked as if he had no intention of receiving the edict.\u2014This title mustn\u2019t be accepted!What Hai Liangyi had said was true. Although he, Xiao Chiye, had rendered meritorious service by protecting the emperor at the Nanlin Hunting Grounds, and had played a critical role in the latest incidents, his contributions were still poles apart from the hard-won military merits gained from battling with real weapons at the frontiers.Who was Lu Pingyan?That was the man who was on brotherly terms with his old man, Xiao Fangxu!Now that they had humiliated and trampled over Lu Pingyan to confer on him, Xiao Chiye, a title, how would Xiao Chiye be able to take office in the various garrison troops at the frontiers? How would he be able to convince the masses? And the most crucial thing was, what would the Lu Clan think? Could Xiao and Lu still be brothers?Dingdu, Dingdu. This was simply to nail him dead in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0Had Li Jianheng\u2019s bout with his illness fucking short-circuited his brain?!Rage bubbled up in Xiao Chiye. What\u2019s more, he had not gotten a good sleep. He tugged at the official robe he had not worn properly and suppressed his fury to say expressionlessly, \u201cGo and report back to His Majesty that Xiao Ce\u2019an is not worthy of the title and does not dare to accept this overwhelming favor from His Majesty, nor does he dare to accept this heaven-sent noble rank.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 : ConfermentXiao Chiye did not accept the imperial edict. Fuman did not dare to persuade him further and hurried his way back to the palace to make his report.After hearing the whole story, Li Jianheng leapt to his\u00a0 feet and said, \u201cIs the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u2019s orders something he can reject as he pleases? When I reward him, he should kneel and accept it! Go again!\u201dGriping to himself, Fuman climbed onto the horse again and returned to Xiao Chiye\u2019s residence. Seeing Xiao Chiye still kneeling, he hurriedly held the imperial edict and bowed to persuade him, \u201cViceroy, Viceroy! Why do this? Didn\u2019t we roll and crawl down there in the ditches all for this?\u201dWith a hint of displeasure on his face, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cI don\u2019t want this noble rank. Don\u2019t bother wasting your breath on me.\u201dFuman was so anxious and desperate that he stomped his foot where he stood. But he could not accept the edict on behalf of Xiao Chiye. All he could do was to play for time.\u201cThen let him kneel!\u201d Back at the palace, Li Jianheng promptly flew into a rage when he heard the reply. \u201cIn order to grant him the reward, I even rebuffed the Secretariat Elder, and he still dares to put on airs? Let him kneel!\u201dSo the sovereign and his minister \u2013 one within the palace and the other, beyond \u2013 remained stuck in a deadlock.At present, it was the third lunar month in Spring, and the ground was icy cold all over. Xiao Chiye kneeled with a straightened back, determined to get Li Jianheng to revoke his order. Perhaps he could have accepted the edict, then used various means to handle this matter in a better way. But he was not willing to.The Lu Clan in Qidong was held in check by the Qi Clan at the top and invaded by Biansha at the bottom. Li Jianheng had been gunning for the easier target when he trampled upon Lu Pingyan, because the Lu Clan was not on par with the Qi and Xiao Clans. The food and clothing expenditures of those 20,000 troops of the Biansha Commandery were all in the imperial court\u2019s control. They did not even have military fields. Otherwise, the Lu Clan would not have to stoop so low as to demand payment every year, or be so poor that they had to sell their family properties and belongings. In the past, when Lu Guangbai entered the capital to make his report, he was never taken seriously. Which typical official in the capital would have such audacity? They were all merely taking their cues from the higher-ups. When Emperor Xiande was around, it was rare for Lu Guangbai to be able to seek an audience with the Emperor. This was not simply a matter of him being liked or detested, but because it concerned the balance of Qidong\u2019s military power.The Xiao and Qi were both great generals stationed at the frontiers. Why did the Hua Clan have to guard against the Prince of Libei alone and go to so much trouble to trap Xiao Chiye in\u00a0Qudu? Because the Xiao Clan was the only dominant force in Libei Great Commandery. There was no other leash in the entire territory that could rein in the Xiao Clan, so they could only tie up Xiao Chiye and turn him into a cage to restrain the Libei Armored Cavalry. Qidong had two generals, Qi Shiyu and Lu Pingyan, who were on par with one another back in those days. But why was Qi Shiyu eventually the one who was conferred with the title of the Five Commanderies\u2019 Commander-in-Chief? This was all because Lu Pingyan and Xiao Fangxu were on close terms with one another, and they were in-laws to boot.1The Lu Clan was the chess piece that provided checks and balances to the power between the three parties.The Lu Clan\u2019s position in the Bianjun Commandery was crucial; it was a heavy responsibility entrusted to them by the imperial court. But even so, the imperial court did not generously bestow titles and ranks upon them. This was meant to hold the Lu in their control and let the Lu be held in check by both the Qi Clan and the imperial court. The Lu could only be a weapon used to fight the foreign enemies; there was no way they could be high-ranking provincial officials with military authority at the borders, and consequently, there would be no way they could be the second Prince of Libei.At present, Lu Guangbai had to consult Qi Zhuyin for the use of troops and consult the Ministry of War and Ministry of Revenue in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0for the use of money. Lu Guangbai was the commanding general in charge of the Bianjun Commandery\u2019s defenses. If Qi Zhuyin had not been generous in delegating authority and gave him the prerogative to self-deploy troops in times of peril, then he would be even more of a predicament than he was at present.This time, Li Jianheng advanced Lu Pingyan\u2019s noble rank, yet there was no actual promotion taking place. Thus, the Lu Clan could only remain perpetually hungry cattle and continue to work to their deaths at the Bianjun Commandery. Their reputation had gone up a notch on the surface, but it was actually an insult deep down. Half of the Lu Clan\u2019s current difficulties had to do with the Xiao Clan; therefore, Xiao Chiye could not\u2014must not accept the edict without so much a gesture.The fact that the imperial edict could be issued made it clear that the Grand Secretariat had given the nod. In that case, it was certain that this order would not be revoked; there was no reason for the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u00a0to change his order. But Xiao Chiye definitely must not accept it with great delight. Even if he had to kowtow and act unreasonably, or even throw a tantrum, he had to show the Lu Clan his stance.It was by virtue of power and might that Li Jianheng could trample all over the Lu Clan, because the imperial court had the Lu in their grasp. In contrast, it was by virtue of friendship that the Xiao Clan did not dare to do the same, because both families had always considered the other brother. If this friendship were to break up, then the Xiao Clan would lose their assistive force in the southeast.Xiao Chiye kneeled until it was dark. Fuman did not dare to sit down arbitrarily and stood at the side with the imperial edict in his hands. After an unspecified amount of time, they heard the sound of hurried footsteps from the entrance. An eunuch arrived and conveyed the orders in an urgent tone, \u201cViceroy, you may stop kneeling! Please get up! His Majesty summons you for an audience!\u201dWithout demur, Xiao Chiye lifted the hem of his robe to get up and got onto his horse to leave. Fuman hurriedly got onto his horse as well, not daring to grouse when he saw Xiao Chiye not showing any signs of exhaustion.Mingli Hall was brightly illuminated. Li Jianheng sat on the dragon throne and listened as someone announced Xiao Chiye\u2019s arrival. But he did not summon the latter in and remained seated to trace characters.Without being summoned, Xiao Chiye could not enter, so he could only kneel outside Mingli Hall. It was already late, and the leftover cold water on the freshly scrubbed floor dampened his robe. The entire courtyard of eunuchs moved quietly, not daring to make a sound.Li Jianheng stared blankly at the glazed lamp. He had been thinking a lot this silent night. By the time he returned to his senses, it was already the hour of\u00a0chou.2\u00a0He sat for a moment, then suddenly rose to his feet and walked out.The palace maids withdrew, and the eunuchs kneeled on the ground. The shadows on the ground were trodden upon. Xiao Chiye did not lift his head.Li Jianheng looked down at Xiao Chiye. In the past, he was always looking up at Xiao Chiye. When they were hanging out on the streets together, Xiao Chiye could be said to be his big brother. They called each other brothers, and they played the fool a lot too. Li Jianheng thought he treated Xiao Chiye with his utmost sincerity.How did they get to where they were today?Li Jianheng was dressed in a bright yellow, round-necked robe with narrow sleeves. With his hands on the amber belt on his waist, he moved over to Xiao Chiye\u2019s side and looked at the luminous moon above the majestic palace eaves. He mulled it over for a moment, then said, \u201cThere\u2019s no one else here at the moment. Let\u2019s talk.\u201dThe cold moonlight cast a blanket over them, effusing a chill along with the wind.Li Jianheng said, \u201cAren\u2019t you usually a bold one? To think giving you a noble rank this time can also scare you to such an extent.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cIt\u2019s incompatible with reason and intolerable under the law.\u201dLi Jianheng paced and said, \u201cDon\u2019t give me that. You have never been one to talk about reason. Before the Nanlin Hunting Grounds incident, we were still good brothers who would risk our lives for the other. After the Nanlin Hunting Grounds incident, we truly became the monarch and his minister, separated by a huge rift. Ce\u2019an, isn\u2019t it good for me to be the emperor and for you to be the viceroy? Why do you have to put on a front with me like this? Just accept the rewards you are awarded with. Cowering like this is really unlike you, Xiao Ce\u2019an.\u201dXiao Chiye could tell what he meant and said, \u201cIf Your Majesty wants to reward me with gold and treasures, I\u2019ll promptly kowtow and say my thanks. But not for a noble rank. I\u2019ve served as an official for six years, and I do not have any notable achievements or mentionable merits in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to show for or to speak of. I feel uneasy now that I have received Your Majesty\u2019s kindness and become a marquis at a sudden snap of a finger.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be uneasy about?\u201d Li Jianheng scoffed. \u201cWith our relationship, you should have been conferred a title a long time ago. The Grand Secretariat interferes with my every move, picking on anything and everything I do. I never had a chance to do this, no? This time, you\u2019ve earned it. Earlier, when Lu Pingyan was conferred a title, it was also because he had effectively resisted and repelled the Biansha Calvary at the border. You protected the Emperor in\u00a0Qudu, and in that, ensured the safety of our empire and society; I see no difference between both.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no rush since the Grand Secretariat has qualms about this.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cWe can\u2019t hurt the old officials\u2019 feelings.\u201d\u201cThe older ones are always thickheaded and obstinate.\u201d Li Jianheng said, \u201cHow can they be so inflexible? Even those in the flesh trade know when to be flexible and read the situation. But these major ministers are still holding on to broken pieces. How very meaningless. After this scare, I thought about a lot of things during my recuperation. Since I\u2019ve become the Emperor, it\u2019s not productive if I just keep crying and whining. We have to find some way to live on, right? I\u2019m not an unreasonable man. Just voice it out if there is good reason to; it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll execute them? Like this time, I want to confer a title upon you, but the Secretariat Elder didn\u2019t agree and led the others to make a scene before me, saying that I was hasty and sloppy in my decisions. I was so troubled over this matter that I spent nights tossing and turning, and they still say I\u2019m hasty!\u201dLi Jianheng turned back as he was speaking, and the gold dragon on his crown flashed in the moonlight, giving him an imposing air of elegance and nobility. He did not tell Xiao Chiye to rise. After a long pause, he continued.\u201cI\u2019m the Emperor, I can\u2019t renege on my word. Since the edict has been made, you just have to accept it. You\u2019ve already rebuffed me once today, but we are brothers, so I won\u2019t hold it against you. But if you continue to be so stubborn with me again, then it won\u2019t be something that can be settled between brothers, and neither of us will look good for it. Deal?\u201dXiao Chiye was silent for a moment before he said, \u201cYour Majesty, that won\u2019t do. The inspection is around the corner. It\u2019s a good thing to advance Old General Lu\u2019s noble rank; he deserves it. But not for me. It\u2019s for Your Majesty\u2019s reputation that I\u2019m not accepting it. I\u2019m someone Your Majesty single-handedly promoted. If I can\u2019t convince the masses in everything I do, then how can I still attend to official duties for Your Majesty in the future? Those who are in charge of military troops are all concerned about their reputation and dignity. If you give this dignity to Old General Lu by showing him due respect, then I will subsequently come to benefit by association too.\u201d\u201cAre you making up all kinds of excuses to decline for my sake or for the Xiao Clan? Do you really think I don\u2019t understand just because you didn\u2019t say it?\u201d Li Jianheng stared at him. \u201cWe are brothers who should treat each other with candor and sincerity. Yet you keep treating me like a fool. It\u2019s for the sake of our friendship that I\u2019m rewarding you, but you turned it down for your own selfish desire! I told you to be honest with me, and you are still beating around the bush with me! Xiao Chiye, don\u2019t you have a conscience?!\u201dThis question Li Jianheng bellowed was so forceful that it faintly reverberated through the cold, dreary night.\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of offending Lu Pingyan. Why is that?!\u201d Li Jianheng suddenly flung his sleeves. \u201cAnd you still dare to say you\u2019re loyal to me? You are doing it all for yourself! You don\u2019t dare to say it, so I\u2019ll say it for you. You\u2019re afraid of offending Lu Pingyan and ruining the friendship between both your clans, which would make it hard for you to mutually look out for each other. But let me ask you, Xiao and Lu both have their own respective military forces to defend the borders, so what is there that you need to look out for each other for?\u201dXiao Chiye tightened his fists, with his thumb ring jammed in the area between his thumb and forefinger.\u201cAll of you are wolves and tigers.\u201d Li Jianheng pointed at Xiao Chiye. \u201cYou people have your mind set on\u00a0Qudu! I was merely sounding you out, and you showed your true colors! Military powers gang up with one another, and the Xiao Clan wants to be in the same faction as the Lu Clan, and then what\u2019s next? Tell me, what are you going to do?!\u201dXiao Chiye abruptly half-propped himself up. He had a well-built physique, and kneeling on one knee like this made him seem as if he was a panther ready to spring into an attack. Li Jianheng immediately took a few steps back and looked at him, badly shaken.\u201c\u2014Of course it\u2019s to do those Biansha baldies in!\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s expression was fierce as he looked at Li Jianheng. \u201cSix years ago, when the Zhongbo troops were defeated, my eldest brother rode non-stop through the night to come to the emperor\u2019s rescue. How dangerous that battle at Cizhou was! Meanwhile, Lu Guangbai held his spear in hand and a dagger in his mouth and fought for three nights before he could break through the siege. He immediately hurried over to\u00a0Qudu\u00a0without even stopping to rest to help\u00a0Qudu\u00a0out of their predicament. Everything Your Majesty had said today is an affront to the Xiao and Lu Clans\u2019 loyalty. That\u2019s right, the reason I\u2019m not accepting the noble rank today is because of Lu Pingyan, but even more because of the unwavering loyalty of the various generals at the frontiers. It\u2019s all because of Your Majesty\u2019s kindness that I, Xiao Ce\u2019an, a good-for-nothing, could live in this\u00a0Qudu\u00a0without having to worry about my own life and death, nor stress about heading out to war. If I could even become a high and mighty marquis with this, then what would Commander Qi and General Lu, both of whom are still enduring hardships at the frontiers, think?\u201d\u201cAfter saying so much, you are just doing it for your own untainted reputation!\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s words were firm and resounding. \u201cMy life is worthless, but Your Majesty is the ruler of our prosperous lands. If you were to reward me for this small bit of contribution and it ends up diminishing the generals\u2019 loyalty to Your Majesty, who would lose out more? Your Majesty, or I?\u201dLi Jianheng looked hesitant and doubtful.Xiao Chiye refused to let this go and continued. \u201cIf this is merely a show I put on to collude with the Lu Clan, why did Secretariat Elder Hai try so hard to convince Your Majesty? Your Majesty, you don\u2019t trust me, but don\u2019t you trust the Hai Liangyi whom the late Emperor appointed and who has come to the emperor\u2019s rescue thrice? Your Majesty has repeatedly met with danger and misfortune, and immediately right after, you are disproportionately dishing out rewards. Whoever it is that\u2019s instigating and abetting Your Majesty ought to be executed!\u201dIt was as if Li Jianheng was suddenly jolted to his senses. He retreated under the eaves, held on to the vermilion pillar for support, and said, \u201cBut the imperial edict has already been issued\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Majesty is the sovereign of a new reign and imperial court. It was inappropriate to bestow rewards during the state mourning period earlier. But now that the two great imperial affairs of spring plowing and inspection are in full swing, why not seize the chance to proclaim a general amnesty to the world and reward the various generals at the frontiers according to the merit evaluation from the Ministry of War? It\u2019s not just permissible to advance Lu Pingyan to the rank of Marquis of Biansha. On the basis of the Lu Clan\u2019s most number of enemy kills at the Bianjun Commandery, they should be rewarded again with an increase of military provisions\u2014Juexi had a bumper harvest last year, and their granaries are filled to the brim. This would not only write off the state treasury\u2019s additional expenditure on dishing out monetary rewards, but also relieve the Bianjun Commandery of their pressing needs. The wedding of Old Commander Qi is fast approaching. Your Majesty, if you also reward and confer Third Missy Hua with the title of Commandery Princess, then you\u2019d be raising Qidong\u2019s prestige.\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s words were earnest, and his gaze, frank. \u201cYou are the sovereign of a great empire, the common ruler of all under the world. Who would still harbor any discontent when you bestowed such grace and favor all around?\u201dWhen Emperor Xiande ascended to the throne, the Empress Dowager was the one making the decisions for him, and consequently, he missed his opportunity to make such a big splash during his reign. The most pressing issue to Li Jianheng now was to prove himself as an emperor. He was suspicious and reacted to another\u2019s instigation only because he was afraid of being declared unworthy of his position. Xiao Chiye\u2019s words simply pushed all his right buttons!\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d With delight on his face, Li Jianheng came down again to move towards Xiao Chiye. \u201cFine! Ce\u2019an, get up quickly. It\u2019s cold on the ground!\u201dFuman, who was kneeling at the bottom, listened with marvel. Who would have thought that in just a few hours, Xiao Chiye would be able to seize the opportunity to deal a counterattack and avert the crisis? If not for having a firm grasp on Li Jianheng\u2019s temperament and mindset, he would never have been able to hit right on the target in just one blow.The more he thought, the more elated he was.There\u2019s hope for him if he throw in his lot with the Second Young Master!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 : Toast ExchangeThe second month of the lunar year was crucial for planting mulberry and flax in spring. The various localities hurried to submit their reports and urge the Ministry of Revenue to allocate funds. With mountains of trivial affairs piling up, the various departments were so busy they were burned out from exhaustion. Li Jianheng dished out the rewards and conferments, and Xiao Chiye was promoted to the rank of Marquis of Dingdu. Meanwhile, Shen Zechuan received a skip in grade and was promoted to a third-grade Vice Commander. He also concurrently took up the portfolio of the Northern Judge and began to take charge of the\u00a0imperial prison.The Grand Secretariat initially did not agree to this, but Cen Yu submitted a memorial to make a strong case for a recommendation. Hai Liangyi also saw Shen Zechuan in a new light because of the epidemic, and so it was decided.Xiao Chiye carried the earring case on him, but he never found the opportunity to run into Shen Zechuan. Shen Zechuan was on the go all over the\u00a0imperial prison, having to go through all the cases accumulated before the new year one at a time. He was so busy he skipped sleep and meals. On the other side, he still had to get Qiao Tianya to lie in wait and keep a watch on Xi Hongxuan so that he could find a way to get Qi Huilian and Ji Gang back.Young swallows made a ruckus on roof beams, while the young shoots of weeping willows spouted. The vermilion walls and green glazed tiles of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0gradually showed as the weather remained clear and sunny for several days in a row. On the day when spring rain fell uninterrupted, Cen Yu hosted a feast and invited a few friends from the latest incident. Hai Liangyi was not one to attend private banquets, and it just happened that he had yet to recover from his illness, so he did not partake in the feast.By the time Shen Zechuan arrived, it was already late. He was led straight to the main hall. When he lifted the curtain, he saw that it was full of officials who were familiar faces to him.Han Cheng, Kong Qiu, and Cen Yu shared a table. Xiao Chiye already had his third round of wine, and he was listening with propped arms to Yu Xiaozai \u2013 whose seat was at the bottom \u2013 telling jokes to an entire hall of important ministers.The moment Shen Zechuan entered, Yu Xiaozai hurriedly paid his obeisances and greeted him. \u201cYour Excellency is late. Please hurry and have a seat at the head of the table.\u201dShen Zechuan removed his cloak and said with a smile, \u201cThere\u2019s much to do in the\u00a0imperial prison, so I\u2019d like to ask of Your Excellencies to please bear with me. I\u2019ll sit at the bottom.\u201dCen Yu stood up and beckoned to him, saying, \u201cThose etiquettes for public display won\u2019t work at private banquets. Once you are here, we are all friends despite our age differences. So why still stand on ceremony? Old Han, you tell him!\u201dHan Cheng said, \u201cIt\u2019s as he said. Lanzhou, come on up and sit here. The few of us old and useless ones have the honor of being in the company of the Marquis today too. Your Lordship, you could be said to have lowered yourself for us!\u201d\u201cCommander-in-chief, what you\u2019re doing is putting me down.\u201d Xiao Chiye seemed to be a little drunk. He did not look at Shen Zechuan and merely smiled, \u201cWho present here is not a respected elder? I\u2019ll still have to look to all of you for advice in the future.\u201dShen Zechuan had already taken his seat, which was a little distance away from Xiao Chiye across the table where he would be able to reach the latter if he stretched out his legs. Both men did not look at each other, nor did they greet the other. Kong Qiu looked left and right at them and said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019ve long heard that both of you have beef with each other. Why won\u2019t you even say a word on meeting each other? You worked on this assignment together, and it seemed all good to me. So why still take those past grudges to heart?\u201d\u201cThe way I see it, both of you are young and promising, and you don\u2019t deflect the responsibility to each other when you\u2019re working. So why not take the chance today to bury the hatchet with a smile?\u201d As Cen Yu spoke, he raised his hands. \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0and the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0have to mutually look out for each other, too. There are plenty of opportunities for both to continue working together in the future. Your Lordship, what do you think? Would that do?\u201dXiao Chiye lazily cast a look at Shen Zechuan. His gaze was indecipherable. He only said, \u201cHow would it not do for me? What is there that I can\u2019t do with a smile from his Excellency the Judge? I should say my proper thanks to His Excellency for this time too.\u201d\u201cWhen have I never greeted Your Lordship with a smile every time I see Your Lordship?\u201d Shen Zechuan touched the wine cup. \u201cI\u2019ve long forgotten the past. It\u2019s just that there has been no opportunity before, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHan Cheng was the one who had the most drinks with Xiao Chiye. On seeing this, he picked up his chopsticks again and said as he picked out the food, \u201cThen, let\u2019s have a drink. Your Lordship, please do me the favor!\u201dYu Xiaozai, who had not sat all this while, promptly filled both of their cups to the brim with wine. Xiao Chiye held his cup with both hands and said without getting up, \u201cThen, let\u2019s toast.\u201dGoing by their official grades, it was indeed the case that Xiao Chiye should not get up. Shen Zechuan stood up, revealing his wrist bones as he lifted his cup.Xiao Chiye suddenly said, \u201cSince this is wine to settle old grudges, then it naturally can\u2019t be drunk in such a common way. Judge, how about a nuptial exchange of matrimony wine?\u201d1Han Cheng promptly laughed. He pointed at Xiao Chiye and shook his head as he said with a sigh, \u201cYour Lordship, that\u2019s too unethical of you. Why put Lanzhou in a spot?\u201d\u201cHow is this putting him in a spot?\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to love and honor him. Aren\u2019t we doing all this as an expression of our determination?\u201dKnowing Xiao Chiye\u2019s temper, Cen Yu thought that Xiao Chiye was still harboring animosity over Zhongbo and that he was intentionally making things difficult for Shen Zechuan. Just as he was prepared to speak up to dissuade Xiao Chiye, Shen Zechuan laughed.\u201cSure.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do as His Lordship says.\u201dShen Zechuan held up the cup and leaned over, where Xiao Chiye could see his faintly discernible collarbone. Both men\u2019s arms intertwined. As Shen Zechuan drank the wine, his Adam\u2019s apple throbbed. Xiao Chiye\u2019s gaze seemed to let out a gurgle too as it followed the wine down into that robe.Xiao Chiye drank very slowly. He held the wine in his mouth, his gaze never once leaving Shen Zechuan. All the time his arm was hooked around Shen Zechuan\u2019s arm, Shen Zechuan could clearly feel his sturdiness.Xiao Chiye seemed to let out a laugh when he finished drinking, but no one heard it; only Shen Zechuan lowered his eyes to look at him. His gaze was naked, and brimming over with dangerous desire.Shen Zechuan extracted his arm and sat back, his back dripping with sweat. Xiao Chiye seemed unfazed as he put up his arms again and inclined his head to listen to the conversation.Cen Yu said, \u201cAfter the spring plow, it\u2019ll be the spring examinations.2\u00a0The Imperial College wants to recruit new students this year. Looks like the Ministry of Revenue will be getting another headache.\u201dKong Qiu snorted a laughter and said, \u201cWhat would Wei Huaigu ache over? He\u2019s the money keeper! He ought to compute them. To begin with, all these should have been suitably arranged way earlier. For him to wait until now to do so is already considered a dereliction of duty.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the money keeper, and you\u2019re the living King of Hell!\u201d Han Cheng set down his chopsticks. Having had his fill of wine and meal, he said, \u201cZhongbo is in such a mess at present, and the number of cases submitted to the Ministry of Justice is as innumerable as the number of hairs on an ox. It won\u2019t do for them to keep delaying sending someone over to take charge of the situation there, would it?\u201d\u201cI think the Secretariat Elder is mulling over whom to send over.\u201d Cen Yu lamented. \u201cIf Lanzhou formally joins the central administration as an official, then he might have a chance this time.\u201dWhether it was due to the heat or the wine, Shen Zechuan\u2019s face was a little red. He said, \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m not qualified and experienced enough to be assigned out of the capital. I won\u2019t be able to quell the unrest.\u201d\u201cJust gain more experience and it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d With his interest piqued, Han Cheng said, \u201cIt is said that officials from the capital are wily. But how can the capital officials be as slippery and sly as the local officials? Some years ago, I went down with the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0to check the accounts, and all those \u2018capital lords\u2019 and \u2018old masters\u2019 were all very crafty and cunning! There were two copies of all the account books in their residences. Even if you, Cen Xunyi, went, you would not be able to distinguish the real accounts from the fakes. Every year, when the imperial envoy heads down, there would be a great flurry of activities. Having long heard the news, they would drive out all the disaster victims and refugees in their territories before your arrival to prevent you from seeing them. This is the so-called \u2018no hunger concern in the territory\u2019 you see in the evaluations. Once you arrive, they would hold a banquet and think up reasons to dunk you with wine. You\u2019d drink until daybreak, then sleep until nightfall. You\u2019d be so drunk that you can\u2019t even stride out of the prefectural\u00a0yamen. So what energy would you still have to check the accounts? Once the time is up, and the silver is in the pockets, the evaluation would be marked as outstanding. Then it\u2019s off to the next place to drink. And that\u2019s considered the end of the check.\u201d\u201cBut there are still those who do their jobs. You can\u2019t taint them all with the same brush.\u201d With that, Cen Yu sighed again. \u201cWhen Xue Xiuzhuo went down a few years ago, he was a formidable sight to behold. All the accounts of the Thirteen Cities of Juexi were sorted out in perfect order without a single error. I originally thought he would be assigned to the Ministry of Revenue. But who would have expected the Secretariat Elder to transfer him to the Court of Judicial Review instead?\u201d\u201cCan he get anywhere being Wei Huaigu\u2019s subordinate?\u201d Kong Qiu leaned against the chair. \u201cThe current vice minister of the Ministry of Revenue exists in name only. Wei Huaigu alone calls the shot and has the final say in the overall management of financial affairs. Won\u2019t he be rendered useless if he goes over? The Secretariat Elder has the intent to polish him; he\u2019s meant to achieve great things in the future.\u201dKong Qiu never had any social dealings with Wei Huaigu and Pan Xiangjie. That he was only friendly to them on the surface but estranged from them deep down was a fact everyone knew. So he was not afraid to speak out in Han Cheng\u2019s presence.Han Cheng laughed out loud and said, \u201cDon\u2019t discuss state affairs at a private feast! How can you forget this? Old Kong, you ought to be punished!\u201dThinking that they were almost done with their meals, Cen Yu said, \u201cWhen Youjing3\u00a0returned a few days back, he told me about a game. It still seems early to me, so why don\u2019t we give it a try? Youjing, take those cards of yours out.\u201dYu Xiaozai readily agreed in response. He took out a wooden box, opened it to take out small carved wooden cards and said, \u201cThis is something this humble subordinate saw others playing when I went to Yongyi Harbor for supervision and inspection\u2014matching cards to pair couplets. Your Excellencies, give it a go?\u201dHan Cheng said to Xiao Chiye, \u201cI\u2019m not good at playing literary games like these. Your Lordship, how about giving me some advice?\u201dXiao Chiye drank his wine and said, \u201cDoes the Commander-in-chief think so highly of me, Xiao Ce\u2019an? Do I look like a man who reads?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just for fun. Let\u2019s just go along with it. Youjing, deal the cards!\u201dYu Xiaozai dealt the three of them the cards. Fiddling with his wine cup, Xiao Chiye was just looking at the cards when something brushed against his calf. He paused suddenly and fixed his gaze on Han Cheng\u2019s cards.Han Cheng looked at his cards with a frown and said, \u201cThe heck are these flowers and plants putting me in a spot! Your Lordship, do you recognize this?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cThrow them both a line based on the foxtail grass. I guarantee\u2014\u201dThat foot with a clean sock tapped Xiao Chiye\u2019s knee, and its sole stepped on his kneecap, as if testing the position.\u201cGuarantee they\u2019ll be stumped!\u201d Han Cheng tossed a card out and said with a smile, \u201cThe swallow teases the foxtail, spring arrives. I randomly made up the first line of a couplet. So now, Xunyi, pair it up!\u201dHan Cheng truly was not a learned man, but he did not let it hold him back. On hearing this, Kong Qiu and Cen Yu laughed. While the three men were talking, Xiao Chiye cast a look at Shen Zechuan.Shen Zechuan grasped his fan, a little moso-bamboo fan that Xiao Chiye had sent someone to deliver to him. He tapped the fan intermittently and listened intently to the conversation. As if sensing Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes on him, the corners of his eyes lifted in a little smile.That foot had already slid in between Xiao Chiye\u2019s legs. It nudged against the inside of his thigh, as if wanting for more. Xiao Chiye held the wine cup with his thumb pressed against the rim as he remained motionless.\u201cIsn\u2019t it a fox?\u201d After a while, Xiao Chiye let out a laugh. He lifted his hand to pick out an ink-traced fox from Han Cheng\u2019s cards and tossed it onto the table. \u201cMoist is the night as the rain seeps through my roof; sultry is the fox\u2019s song in my dream. Where to seek the tide of spring? That wet, persistent drip is the hint\u2014sorry for the obscenity!\u201dHan Cheng exchanged toasts with Xiao Chiye, then laughed and said, \u201cWe are being serious here, but why is it that you just had to turn a fox into a vixen when it\u2019s your turn?!\u201d A foot reached out from under the table. Its toe slowly slid up Xiao Chiye\u2019s calf, playing back and forth a few times along the curve of his calf.\u201cBut men like me\u2026\u201d Xiao Chiye drank his wine and looked at Shen Zechuan. \u201c\u2026 simply attract foxes.\u201d\u201cHow is any respectable person able to continue with that? It\u2019s too crude.\u201d Kong Qiu laughed and sighed. \u201cYou, Xiao Ce\u2019an, don\u2019t even close the door tight when you sleep, and you still blame the others for looking for you. You\u2019re obviously looking forward to it yourself, right?\u201dXiao Chiye did not say a word. But when that foot stepped down on him gently, he laughed. The upper half of Shen Zechuan\u2019s body was so steady that nothing seemed off. He rubbed his fingertips, which had been tapping on the fan. In this room full of heat, even the corners of his eyes were about to redden.It just so happened that Cen Yu threw the card onto the ground. Yu Xiaozai quickly stopped what he was doing and made to lean over to pick it up.Shen Zechuan prepared to retract his foot. But unexpectedly enough, Xiao Chiye reached his hand down to grab hold of his ankle. His sole was stepping on Xiao Chiye\u2019s unmentionable spot through the fabric. Xiao Chiye slipped two fingers into the clean sock and stroked Shen Zechuan.Shen Zechuan\u2019s fan rested on the tabletop. Yu Xiaozai had already lifted the hem of his robe and his waist was already slightly bending over as he said, \u201cYour Excellencies, please lift your legs. Let this humble subordinate see where it has dropped to\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye was not the slightest bit flustered as he steadily grasped onto Shen Zechuan\u2019s ankle. He exerted a little force with his thumb, caressing Shen Zechuan until Shen Zechuan felt a tingle of numbness run up his spine and tightened his grip on his fan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 : Night RideYu Xiaozai held the hem of his robe up and was about to squat down when Xiao Chiye let his wine cup drop. Han Cheng, being near, ended up having his robe dirtied. Yu Xiaozai left the cards and went to get a handkerchief for Han Cheng to clean himself. Cen Yu was still squinting at his cards when the wine splashed him. He hastily tried to dodge it too, making Kong Qiu laugh loudly.Han Cheng tugged at his robe and said to Xiao Chiye, \u201cYour Lordship, you\u2019ve had too much to drink; even your hands are unsteady now!\u201dXiao Chiye raised his hand in apology and said, \u201cApologies, I\u2019ll get someone to send you a replacement tomorrow as compensation.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need. Just how much is a set of robes worth?\u201d How could Han Cheng really let Xiao Chiye compensate him? He did not even dare to pull a long face as he said with a smile, \u201cWe\u2019ll treat this cup as a toast from Your Lordship!\u201dShen Zechuan had already withdrawn his foot. He leaned over and picked up the card from the floor. As he placed it on the table, he heard Xiao Chiye laughing. The lingering warmth on his ankle where Xiao Chiye had squeezed grew hotter amidst the laughter.Kong Qiu was already drunk. He looked completely opposite of how he usually did when he was in court as he struck a porcelain cup with his chopsticks and sang out incomprehensible lyrics alone in the chaotic atmosphere.Cen Yu, seeing Kong Qiu stir up such an improper and unsightly ruckus, tugged on his sleeve and said, \u201cBoran! Stop singing. Let\u2019s go home and sleep! You still need to sit in Xi Hongxuan\u2019s trial the day after tomorrow!\u201dKong Qiu held up his cup, struck it with increasing glee, and said, \u201cI remember that. I\u2019m investigating him!\u201dCen Yu could not keep a hold of him and said, \u201cThankfully, I was the one who invited you to the feast today, or else you would be impeached for sure for behaving in such an audacious, unrestrained manner.\u201d\u201cOkay then, let them impeach!\u201d Kong Qiu said, \u201cLet them impeach! Imperial censors ought to have the courage to speak.\u201d\u201cRight, well said!\u201d Han Cheng also laughed, \u201cBefore spring, we were saddled with such a massive pile of work that we could scarcely breathe. How many times could we enjoy ourselves to the greatest? Let him enjoy himself to his heart\u2019s content!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s almost time to wind down. If we make a ruckus too late into the night, the Secretariat Elder won\u2019t be happy with us.\u201d Xiao Chiye got to his feet and called to Chen Yang, \u201cSend His Excellency Kong back in my horse carriage!\u201dThe attendants swarmed all around, and Chen Yang helped Kong Qiu out the door. Cen Yu wiped away his hot sweat and said to the remaining men, \u201cYou don\u2019t know this, but Boran was also once an unconventional and uninhibited person, but because Secretariat Elder is particularly set on self-restraint and observance of proprieties, he put him in order and whipped him into shape. It\u2019s not advisable to drink too much of this wine. Why doesn\u2019t everyone wait for a moment while I\u2019ll tell the cook to boil some soups to sober you up? Drink it up before you leave!\u201d\u201cI was just thinking about your residence\u2019s dough drop and assorted vegetable soup!\u201d Han Cheng forwent the formalities. \u201cAdd some vinegar to mine. I\u2019ll drink it before leaving.\u201dShen Zechuan bowed and said, \u201cThe\u00a0imperial prison\u00a0still has urgent cases to be processed tomorrow morning, so I won\u2019t stay. Everyone, please enjoy your meal. If time permits in the future, I\u2019ll invite everyone for another round.\u201dHan Cheng knew that he was indeed busy of late and told him, \u201cWhen you previously held the post of the Southern Judge, the military craftsmen kept a close eye on you. Now that you\u2019ve transferred to the office of the Northern Judge, there\u2019s no need for you to rush between both ends until you are too busy to do anything else. The subordinates will remember your kind treatment of them and naturally won\u2019t make things too difficult for you.\u201dShen Zechuan uttered a sound of acknowledgment. Cen Yu insisted on sending him off. It would not do for Shen Zechuan to decline, so they walked out of the doors together. It was raining heavily outside, and everything was covered in a thick layer of fog. The drift of fresh air on their faces dispelled the wine-induced heat from their bodies, making them feel much more refreshed.Cen Yu led Shen Zechuan down the stairs and said, \u201cTo find time to attend the feast tonight, you must have pushed back a great deal of work.\u201d\u201cNot quite. The urgent cases that need to be dealt with have been sealed and finalized before today.\u201d Shen Zechuan replied with a smile.Cen Yu nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s good. Assignments cannot be delayed.\u201dCen Yu accompanied him all the way to the gates and then ordered someone to hold up an umbrella and lantern for him. He truly valued Shen Zechuan for his talents, but it was a pity that Shen Zechuan served in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards.Finally, Cen Yu said, \u201cAll the cases in the\u00a0Imperial Prison\u00a0are major cases that not even the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices\u00a0can interfere with. You could be said to have enjoyed a meteoric rise with this position, so you must speak with caution and act with prudence. It is often said that being close to the sovereign is as perilous as lying with a tiger. Those who can handle affairs in the presence of the emperor are all born intelligent and quick-witted. That said, you needn\u2019t worry too much about qualification, for you are already considered to have reached success in your youth. You still have a long time to go and a long way ahead of you, so remember, there is no need to be anxious about anything else other than your assignments. The Marquis of Dingdu is not a narrow-minded man either. You are bound to have to work together on missions in the future. The hatchet has been buried tonight with wine. Even if you cannot become soulmates with him, it\u2019s still better to be friends who can look out for each other than to fly into a rage each time you meet each other. Lanzhou, I value your talent, and I hope that you will work hard and achieve success in your career!\u201dCen Yu bared his heart out with such sincerity that Shen Zechuan was wholeheartedly convinced. He bowed, and Cen Yu helped him up again, saying, \u201cThe road is slippery on rainy nights. Be careful on your way. You may go.\u201dShen Zechuan draped the pristinely white fur coat that Li Jianheng had bestowed on him and bade farewell to Cen Yu. He did not get in the sedan, but let Qiao Tianya hold up the umbrella for him as one master and one servant walked into the rain.The two had not been walking along the streets for long when they heard the sound of hoofbeats behind them. Qiao Tianya shook the rainwater off before stepping aside, and as expected, saw Xiao Chiye on horseback galloping towards them at full speed.\u201cGood timing. I\u2014\u201dQiao Tianya did not even get to finish his sentence as Xiao Chiye bent to pick Shen Zechuan up and left with him. The water droplets kicked up by the horse\u2019s hooves splashed all over Qiao Tianya. He spread his arms open and slowly finished his sentence, \u201c\u2026 want to drink some\u00a0shaojiu.\u201d1Xiao Chiye was well-built. Even with Shen Zechuan in his arms, he did not find it inconvenient. It was in this way he hugged Shen Zechuan as he effortlessly rode his horse away. The chest backing Shen Zechuan was firm and muscular, as if it was an indestructible iron wall of silver.Lang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0galloped into the rain like a bolt of lightning flashing through the pitch-black rainy night. It trod into countless puddles of water, splattering them as it charged straight for the city gates.\u201cWho goes there riding his horse this late in the night?!\u201d The guard at the top of the wall raised his lantern and demanded.Xiao Chiye pulled at his cloak to wrap Shen Zechuan under it before raising his own waist token. He said, \u201cOpen the gates.\u201d\u201cVice\u2026 Marquis!\u201d The platoon commander at the top of the wall immediately paid his obeisances, then waved his hands and ordered, \u201cQuick, open the gates!\u201dThe gates opened with a loud rumble, and\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0galloped straight out. With the night wind whipping against their cheek,\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0galloped faster and faster, while a circling gyrfalcon charged out from the rain and followed closely behind.Shen Zechuan held onto the back of the horse and said, \u201cWe can\u2019t go too far. Tomorrow morning\u2014\u201dXiao Chiye grabbed Shen Zechuan\u2019s chin, pulled it toward himself, and tilted his head to kiss him. Shen Zechuan was not gifted at horsemanship, and other than Xiao Chiye, he had nowhere else to hold on to as they raced forth like the wind. With one hand pressing against the jerking back of the horse and the other clutching onto Xiao Chiye\u2019s body for support, there was no way for him to look at the road in front. The pitter-pattering rain wetted his eyes as they kissed.They had not seen each other for seven or eight days.Xiao Chiye embraced Shen Zechuan tightly with one hand, pressing him to his chest as he kissed down along his cheek to the side of his neck.Shen Zechuan\u2019s clothes were in disarray. The official robe beneath his white fur coat had been tugged open slightly. When he lifted his eyes, all he could see was the jet-black rainy night. The water droplets trickled down along the curve into his collar, drenching his clothes, and even himself. His caresses wrinkled Xiao Chiye\u2019s robe even as Xiao Chiye made him gasp for breath.The rain poured even harder and noisier as\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0ran blindly into the night. The path in front of them was already hidden in the long, dark night, and the horse was like the lone boat carrying a pair of lovers on a secret rendezvous.Shen Zechuan closed his eyes while taking all of it, shivering while bathed in sweat and rainwater. Xiao Chiye did not say a word as the horse\u2019s hooves trod on mud. The path was so uneven and hard to navigate that a few ensuing bumps and jolts caused the sounds to escape from Shen Zechuan\u2019s throat.Xiao Chiye was also sweating a little. Spurred on by the potent wine, he grasped Shen Zechuan amidst this frenzy of pleasure, making every rise and fall hit just the right spot. He was in even more high spirits after drinking wine, and he used his strength skillfully, making Shen Zechuan incapable of resisting and unable to escape.\u201cDoes the friction feel good?\u201d Seeing that Shen Zechuan wanted to lean away, Xiao Chiye clasped his hands and pulled him back in an embrace.Pressed against him, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cMmm\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cNext time, I\u2019ll grind the right spot.\u201dXiao Chiye stroked Shen Zechuan\u2019s earlobe and fastened an object. He pushed aside those drenched locks of hair and kissed it.As Shen Zechuan raised his head, the jasper swayed with his movement. He dazedly touched the pendant. Several times, he opened his mouth to speak, but he was always disrupted by his gasps for breath. As he rode on the tidal waves of euphoria, he gazed at Xiao Chiye with a contradictory blend of understanding and incomprehension.Xiao Chiye killed off the only remaining tenderness he had left.It was really bad for the spring days to warm up again after a cold spell, for this was the season to have fun. Scoundrels all like having fun. As long as they were together, they could create a stir where there was none. The suggestive look in their eyes when their gazes met and the tingle of numbness that sprang up their spines was so strong that they itched to tantalize the other into ripping apart his mask of decency. No one understood the debauchery taking place underneath their official robes.As long as there was no one else, they would show their true colors.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 : Casting The NetThe night rain had just stopped, but the sensual dampness between the beddings lingered.The hot springs had been renovated anew; although it was small, it was completed. With his clothes draped over him, Xiao Chiye fed the horse and gyrfalcon. All that could be heard on Mount Feng at the third quarter of the hour of\u00a0mao1\u00a0was the sound of water dripping from the eaves. He soaked in the mountain breeze for a moment with the front of his clothes opened. The chill of early spring gradually calmed the stimulation and excitement that had lasted all night. He had sobered up, but his passion had become all the more thick and viscous, followed by a kind of post-indulgence relaxation and tenderness.This was the pleasure of indulging in desire.Xiao Chiye removed the saddle on\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin\u2019s back and gestured to Meng. Meng promptly spread its wings and flew out of the eaves into the forest.Xiao Chiye turned around to enter the room, where the heat and dampness had not receded. Shen Zechuan was sprawled over the pillow with the blanket over him. There was no way to tell if he was asleep or not. His half-exposed right ear was still wearing the earring. Xiao Chiye lowered his hand to take it off for him and, in passing, rubbed his ear that had gone red from being clasped by the earring.Shen Zechuan let loose a sound. He had yet to fall into a sound sleep. He laid there for a moment, then slightly opened his eyes to look at Xiao Chiye and said in a hoarse voice, \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s time we leave.\u201dXiao Chiye rolled over and lay down beside Shen Zechuan. He looked at him in the eye and said, \u201cIt\u2019s the day off today. It\u2019s still early.\u201dShen Zechuan uttered a sound of acknowledgment and said, \u201cThere is still work to be done in the\u00a0imperial prison.\u201d\u201cA busy man.\u201d Xiao Chiye grasped his fingertips and pulled him towards himself. \u201cIn just one day, you rose to the position of Northern Judge, and you were also promoted to Vice Commander. The people you have to deal with now are all noble descendants of hereditary ranks. It\u2019s going to be hard for you to manage them; there\u2019s bound to be someone who wants to trip you up with underhand means.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to be the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u00a0and the officials in his inner ministerial circle.\u201dIt was in this way Shen Zechuan lay, with the word \u2018satiated\u2019 written all over his expression. Both men looked at each other for a moment. Like the gentleness after a rainstorm, their kiss was both light and slow. In this humble thatched cottage, they wholeheartedly bared themselves to one another. It was as if in these few hours they left\u00a0Qudu, they could cast aside all the so-called maturity and prudence to become young men of similar ages.Xiao Chiye whispered, \u201cThis place is too small, with the view of the sky all blocked by vermilion walls, and the mountains and plains all surrounded by cities.\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0can\u2019t run to its heart\u2019s content\u2026 When we return to Libei someday in the future, I\u2019ll take you galloping all over Hongyan Mountains.\u201dShen Zechuan pressed against his chest and asked, \u201cIs the moon in Libei as round as the moon in Duanzhou?\u201dXiao Chiye thought for a long while before he said, \u201cI\u2019ve already forgotten\u2026 Is the grass in Duanzhou as tall as the grass in Libei?\u201dShen Zechuan also said, \u201cI\u2019ve already forgotten.\u201dThey suddenly burst out into laughter, dispelling that bit of melancholy. Shen Zechuan took in Xiao Chiye\u2019s scent as Xiao Chiye pressed his chin against the top of Shen Zechuan\u2019s head.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cLet\u2019s go together.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cHome?\u201dXiao Chiye tightened his arms around Shen Zechuan and said, \u201cHome\u2026 Let\u2019s ask Ji Gang-shifu\u00a0to go together with us. Libei is so big; there will be plenty of places to stay.\u201dShen Zechuan laughed out loud and said with lowered eyes, \u201cShifu\u00a0wants to return to Duanzhou. I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be able to go together.\u201dXiao Chiye also lowered his eyes and said to him, \u201cAs long as we are out of\u00a0Qudu, we will be able to go together, even to the ends of the earth.\u201dShen Zechuan met Xiao Chiye\u2019s gaze and said, \u201cThe wolf pup should be in Libei. Otherwise, it\u2019d be a pity for it to become flabby due to a long period of inactivity.\u201d2Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes were calm and serene as he said, \u201cLibei has my eldest brother, and the Libei Armored Cavalry has my father. Horse-racing is the only thing that suits me.\u201dShen Zechuan lifted Xiao Chiye\u2019s chin and gazed at him. He said, \u201cNatural talents are bound to have their own uses; it\u2019s just that the time has yet to come. Ce\u2019an, Ce\u2019an\u2014All of Libei\u2019s hope lies in these two words.\u201dXiao Chiye laughed in a deep voice and suddenly rolled over to pin Shen Zechuan down. Pressing his forehead against Shen Zechuan\u2019s forehead, he said, \u201cDo you want me or not?\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s waist was sore, and his back was aching. As he recovered his strength and eased up his muscles, he squeezed the back of Xiao Chiye\u2019s neck and said in a husky voice, \u201cAre you giving me or not?\u201dXiao Chiye lowered his head to kiss him and pulled up the blanket over them.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8After that rainy night,\u00a0Qudu\u2019s weather took a turn for the hotter.The Grand Secretariat demanded Pan Xiangjie\u2019s dismissal from his position of the Minister of Works, while the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0submitted more than ten memorials in a row to impeach Pan Xiangjie. Their daily contentions in the imperial court were so heated that it made Li Jianheng\u2019s ears ache.Originally, Wei Huaigu and the major-league ministers from the other noble clans would stick together for mutual benefits; thus, they would not easily abandon anyone. For example, men like Fu Linye were eventually demoted with a reduced salary and not exiled out of the capital. After the fall of Hua Siqian, Hai Liangyi took over the position of the Grand Secretary of the Grand Secretariat. Although he entrusted Xue Xiuzhuo, who was from a noble clan, with heavy responsibilities, he had also successively promoted several low-grade officials from humble backgrounds. Of them, Kong Qiu was the most conspicuous, and both sides pit against one another, overtly and covertly. However, what happened this time was a matter of grave importance. If Pan Xiangjie was not impeached, then Wei Huaigu would have to be impeached. Someone had to take the blame for the clogged official ditches. There was no way to find a scapegoat at all.The way things were playing out, the Ministry of Revenue was obviously much more important than the Ministry of Works. To the noble clans, the one who did manual labor could be cast aside, but the one who managed money must be retained. It was not just Pan Xiangjie who had to be dismissed and prosecuted. Even his eldest son of lawful birth, who was the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, had to be suspended from his post to await impeachment.Li Jianheng no longer spoke up on the imperial court that easily. After adjourning the court, he called for Xiao Chiye, and both men wandered around the garden for some spring appreciation.\u201cI heard that you braved the rain to head out of the capital some days back.\u201d Dressed in bright yellow regular wear, Li Jianheng picked some candied fruits from the table and shared half with Xiao Chiye. \u201cFor what purpose?\u201d\u201cThe military drill grounds are close to Mount Feng. I get worried each time it rains. It has only been a few days since the public ditches incident, so I rushed over that night to take a look.\u201d Xiao Chiye smiled and replied, as if he did not notice that Li Jianheng had sent someone to keep an eye on him. \u201cYour Majesty knows of that military drill grounds too. It cost the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0a lot of money. If it were to get damaged from the rain, those 20,000 men of mine would have to share and put up with the Eight Great Training Divisions.\u201d\u201cIf you bring the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0to the Eight Great Training Divisions\u2019 military grounds, the Ministry of Revenue will promptly allocate the funds to you tomorrow.\u201d Li Jianheng tossed the candied fruit into his mouth and said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough these days to understand that they are guarding against you. They are only too glad to be as far away from you as possible.\u201dXiao Chiye said self-mockingly, \u201cWe are all attending to official duties. Where did they get that many ideas from?\u201dLi Jianheng recalled the last time Xiao Chiye was besieged and attacked on all sides by these people on the imperial court and promptly said, \u201cThey are full of evil tricks, and they are crafty to boot. Each one of them is such an eloquent speaker when it comes to handling matters, but in truth, they are all for the specific purpose of setting others up. They even dare to cajole me, what\u2019s more, you? We have to punish this Pan Xiangjie this time. He did not do his job properly and almost caused me to die. And guess what? Last night, Commandery Princess Zhaoyue entered the palace to keep the Empress Dowager company. The Empress Dowager knew better and said she would not interfere in state affairs. Only then did she manage to send her away. Tell me, how would a lady who\u2019s about to get married know about the insides and outs of these matters? Isn\u2019t it all because she was forced to by the Marquis of Helian? After all, both of their families are in-laws!\u201dXiao Chiye followed Li Jianheng down the stairs and walked beneath those newly-sprouted branches. He said, \u201cHas Your Majesty made up your mind to punish Pan Xiangjie severely?\u201dLi Jianheng said, \u201cOf course. We mustn\u2019t let him off easily. There was a picture of the disaster victims from the low-lying area sandwiched inside the memorial Cen Yu submitted; they are really too pitiful. I\u2019m the Emperor who lives in the imperial palace. Just like what the Secretariat Elder said, there are many matters I can only find out through word of mouth. Pan Xiangjie\u2019s negligence and tardiness in clearing up the clogged ditches caused so much harm to the others. I definitely have to punish him. The Secretariat Elder has the same intent too.\u201dHaving tasted the sweetness from dishing out rewards and having been praised by the imperial censors, he now wanted to single out Pan Xiangjie to make an example out of him.\u201cI happen to disagree with the Secretariat Elder.\u201d Xiao Chiye said out of the blue. \u201cPan Xiangjie deserves to be punished. But this man mustn\u2019t be too easily removed from office.\u201dLi Jianheng turned his head back and said with a frown, \u201cIf we don\u2019t deal with him after he makes such a blunder, then are you going to keep him around for him to make another one?\u201dXiao Chiye cast a glance at the clear sky overhead and remembered what Shen Zechuan had said. He suddenly laughed and said to Li Jianheng, \u201cOf course Your Majesty has to deal with him. But if you dismiss him from his post, it\u2019ll be tantamount to cutting off his career path. Pan Xiangjie is currently advanced in age, and he has also made some contributions in his position of the Minister of the Ministry of Works. Your Majesty, the blockage of the public ditches this time caused a surge in slop, which has indeed flooded and damaged the streets. Yet the embankments of Kailing River remained solid and secured like a wall of iron. In previous years, when the localities were flooded, there were very few dams and embankments that could hold up. Clearly, Pan Xiangjie has put some thoughts into this and has not cut corners.\u201d\u201cBut his negligence and oversight of the public ditches is a fact, too. There\u2019s no reason to let him off easy just because of Kailing River.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThe court assembly this morning discussed the allocation of funds for the spring plow. The Ministry of Revenue has been wrestling with the localities over this, and this matter has been stuck at an impasse for half a month. If we wait any further, we will miss the time.\u201d\u201cWhat has this got to do with not dismissing Pan Xiangjie?\u201d Li Jianheng was not too pleased. \u201cEven if we retain him, the Ministry of Revenue will not allocate the fund. Wei Huaigu\u2019s subordinates are all very articulate. Even the Secretariat Elder can\u2019t be bothered to waste his breath on them. Only the imperial censors from the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0can tie with them when it comes to rebuking and condemning others.\u201d\u201cThe Ministry of Revenue? The subordinates who are currently capable of attending official duties are all Wei Huaigu\u2019s proteges, so naturally, they will act according to Wei Huaigu\u2019s will. But Pan Xiangjie\u2019s son, Pan Lin, also happens to hold the post of Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue. If Your Majesty can simply go through the motions in dealing with Pan Xiangjie this time, then their Pan Clan, graced with imperial favor, will surely remember Your Majesty\u2019s kindness. By then, his son would be just like Your Majesty\u2019s son. If Your Majesty has to deal with the Ministry of Revenue in the future, you\u2019ll have your own man in the Ministry of Revenue who can speak up on your behalf. Furthermore, once Pan Xiangjie is dismissed and prosecuted, the Ministry of Works will have to nominate someone else to take up the ministerial post. The new person may not necessarily be more loyal than Pan Xiangjie.\u201d Xiao Chiye paused here and let Li Jianheng think for himself.Li Jianheng took a few steps and said hesitantly, \u201cBut if he\u2019s not dismissed, there still has to be a punishment that can convince the masses.\u201d\u201cPan and Fei are related through marriage, while Fei and Xi are close to each other. What they don\u2019t lack the most is money. Your Majesty can fine Pan Xiangjie and get him to cover all the expenses incurred during the dredging of the public ditches, then hand him the punishment of flogging.\u201d\u201cFlogging?\u201d Li Jianheng said in astonishment. \u201cHe\u2019s so old; won\u2019t he be beaten to death?!\u201d\u201cHow is he going to mend his ways and be grateful if you don\u2019t let him have a taste of \u2018death\u2019?\u201d Xiao Chiye smiled. \u201cLet the imperial censors rebuke him to their satisfaction. By the time Your Majesty summons him for an audience again, he will be deeply grateful even if Your Majesty tells him to bark like a dog in public, let alone cover the expenses.\u201dDelighted, Li Jianheng circled back and said to Xiao Chiye, \u201cAs usual, you\u2019re the resourceful one!\u201d\u201cWei Huaigu is also the one who ran the audit of the expenditure this time. I fear he has, out of impure intentions, doctored the accounts. So it\u2019s still better for Your Majesty to go over this case again and act with prudence.\u201dAs expected, Li Jianheng looked to be put in a spot as he said, \u201cThis is a job for the Ministry of Revenue. Where would I have the man? The other ministries can\u2019t interfere in this matter either.\u201d\u201cThen find one of those in the Ministry of Revenue to do it. The official at the top can\u2019t give a clear explanation, but the petty officials at the bottom are all honest men who actually carry out tasks for Your Majesty.\u201d Xiao Chiye brushed aside a branch and seemed to think about it before he continued, \u201cI met a competent official at Zhao Zui Temple this incident, He was the one who kept records of the accounts for the medicinal herbs which the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0had submitted earlier. Even the Secretariat Elder was full of praise for him. Your Majesty, how about letting him try?\u201dOverjoyed, Li Jianheng said, \u201cIf even the Secretariat Elder has praised him, then we can\u2019t go wrong with him!\u201dXiao Chiye said in a steady voice, \u201cThis man\u2019s name is Liang Cuishan.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xi Hongxuan was taken into custody in the prison. He originally thought that with Li Jianheng to protect him and Xue Xiuzhuo to use his power to help him, he would be quickly released. Who would have known that he would be locked up for so many days? No one delivered messages to keep him updated either; thus, he guessed that something must have gone wrong somewhere in between.When Shen Zechuan arrived at the prison, he had his waist token with him. He was someone who had a drink with Kong Qiu before, and he was a newly appointed official who rose to prominence the fastest. So Qiao Tianya only had to use a few catty of wine to talk the warden around.When Xi Hongxuan saw Shen Zechuan, he hurriedly got up and asked through the bars, \u201cHow is it? Why has there been no news? Has Pan Xiangjie been punished? If so, then it\u2019s time for me to be released!\u201dAlthough Shen Zechuan had his waist token hung, he was not wearing his official robe. He was dressed in a dark blue everyday wear with his collars tightly secured. His facial features were enveloped by the dim light when he entered, and the contrast of his clothes against the color of his skin made him look extremely white, with a hint of frostiness.\u201cYou\u2019re still waiting for Pan Xiangjie to be prosecuted?\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cThere\u2019s been nothing about Pan Xiangjie these days.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s in charge of the Ministry of Works. How will they justify it if they don\u2019t punish him after there\u2019s such a big problem with the public ditches? Even His Majesty won\u2019t be able to justify it.\u201d Xi Hongxuan clenched and tightened his fists. \u201cWhat went wrong in between?\u201d\u201cTo shirk responsibility and shift the blame, Wei Huaigu relentlessly latched on to Pan Xiangjie. But as you know too, things can backfire when it reaches its limits. Even a\u00a0jade\u00a0rabbit can bite humans when it\u2019s forced into a corner, let alone Pan Xiangjie? To mitigate their crime, the Pan Clan wants to cover the expenses this time. The porridge shack over at Zhao Zui Temple has yet to be dismantled, and the womenfolk of the Pan Clan has already gone over to give out porridge to the disaster victims. They put on a meticulous show and did a careful job of keeping up appearance while assuming the stance of eating humble pie, as if they were submitting themselves to physical and verbal abuses from the others. Like they say, not for the sake of the monk but for that of the Buddha.3\u00a0So even the Secretariat Elder would have to take this into consideration and reconsider his punishment.\u201d Without a smile on his face, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way the Ministry of Revenue\u2019s delays of the accounts can be covered up. For everyone\u2019s good, Wei Huaigu should also admit his mistakes and endure a scolding. Yet, he is simply too oblivious and doesn\u2019t know when to advance and retreat. Second Young Master, since Pan Xiangjie isn\u2019t dismissed and Wei Huaigu isn\u2019t punished, then they can only single you out this time and put you on the chopping board.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Xi Hongxuan said, \u201cWei Huaigu is too money-minded. The reason he\u2019s suppressing this matter and refusing to relent is because he\u2019s afraid that the Ministry of Revenue\u2019s disparity cannot be covered up after he admits his mistakes, and Hai Liangyi would then have him in his grasp. Going by his temperament, if he can\u2019t kick out Pan Xiangjie to take the blame for him, then he will force me to fish out the money. No matter what, he won\u2019t let himself suffer. Fuck it, that wily old fox!\u201dWhen they were all bashing Xiao Chiye together, they all wanted to ride on the Eight Great Training Divisions\u2019 coattails and have a share in the benefits reaped from the Eight Great Training Divisions. But now, Xiao Chiye had not even been knocked out, and they were fighting among themselves. Xi Hongxuan felt indignant. He had previously spent quite a sum of money on the matter concerning Xi Gu\u2019an. The good thing was that their family\u2019s salt mines were not confiscated and sealed off, so they were still raking in money. In any case, the imperial court had no idea about the Xi Clan\u2019s private accounts. But it was different when Wei Huaigu wanted money. The\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0knew best what the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0were like. The Xi Clan sold salt and headed out to sea, and they even kept and maintained a large batch of ships at Yongquan Harbor\u2014these were stuff the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0knew all too well.\u201cSpending money to ward off calamities.\u201d Shen Zechuan said gravely and earnestly, \u201cWith yourself behind bars now, you have to choose a man you can trust to handle this matter for you on the outside. You are transferring money within private accounts. If the Wei Clan wants some ten thousand taels, then just the transportation alone would be a big problem. There has to be someone who can organize it all for you. Furthermore, this matter is of utmost urgency, so have it done as quickly as possible.\u201d\u201cLook for Yanqing\u201d Xi Hongxuan blurted out. Having done so, he hesitated again.Xue Xiuzhuo knew the ins and outs of the Xi Clan, and it was hard to say if he might get some other ideas during the process. The Xi Clan\u2019s accumulated mountain of gold and silver was something the previous few generations risked their lives to hoard, and they had countless successions of connected shops and businesses in Juexi and Hezhou. Xi Hongxuan could afford the money, but there was no one he could really entrust it with. With Xi Gu\u2019an dead, the few Xi Clan concubines were really going at it with their abacuses. Perhaps even before he, Xi Hongxuan, died in prison, he would end up dying by his own family members\u2019 hands.Xi Hongxuan suddenly said, \u201cLanzhou, you\u2019ve been promoted to Vice Commander, and you also manage the\u00a0imperial prison. You have the special rights to enter and exit\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to handle cases. It\u2019s too inconvenient for Yanqing, with him currently being in the Court of Judicial Review and all. I\u2019m afraid he will be too conspicuous and end up being investigated by the others. How about you handle this matter instead?\u201dShen Zechuan was rather surprised and said, \u201cI\u2019ve neither managed accounts nor dealt with Wei Huaigu before, and I\u2019m not familiar with your businesses on the outside too. So how would I be able to handle this well?\u201dUnfamiliarity was exactly what he wanted!Xi Hongxuan said, \u201cThere are managers appointed by me over at the salterns. They are quick and efficient, so you don\u2019t need to worry about the money. It\u2019s just that transportation would prove to be particularly troublesome if the sum is too large. Tens of thousands of money worth would pile up into mountains when loaded onto the carts. You can\u2019t go the water route. All my family\u2019s routes are sea-based. Head inward to the north, and the Hua Clan of Dicheng has the final say, while the Yan Clan of Hezhou calls the shots in the south. So you can only take the overland route, which would require you to traverse the thirteen cities of Juexi\u2026Motherfucker! I don\u2019t believe this much money can\u2019t bury that Wei Huaigu to death alive! In any case, you don\u2019t need to fear anything else while passing through Juexi, but you must be on guard against Jiang Qingshan. This man is a tough one. If he catches us red-handed, I\u2019ll be skinned!\u201dShen Zechuan was in no hurry to agree. He said, \u201cThis is an important issue. You should have a word with Xue Xiuzhuo and let him know.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Xi Hongxuan considered it carefully. \u201cYanqing is not a person who can handle this kind of matter. It\u2019d work to the contrary if he were to intervene again. You only need to tell him to continue to think of a way to plead for mercy on my behalf on the imperial court. His Majesty\u2019s momentary hesitation is no big deal, but when I get out this time, Wei Huaigu will be the first one I\u2019ll kill!\u201dAfter he said that, he smiled at Shen Zechuan.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to panic. I know you have never conducted a business transaction before. I left a bookkeeper in my\u00a0Qudu\u00a0residence. His name is Xi Dan, an old hand in my employ. Let him accompany you\u2026 I\u2019ll naturally have my own plans once I see him.\u201dXi Hongxuan was quick-thinking. He did not dare to trust Shen Zechuan just yet. He remembered how Ji Lei had been played to death, so he held back and insisted on seeing his own man before he would take out his money. The Xi Clan\u2019s keys were in a place only he knew of. Without the key, all the Xi Clan\u2019s money vaults could not be opened.\u201cGive it a few days.\u201d Shen Zechuan said softly, \u201cI\u2019ll bring him to see you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 : DisputePan Xiangjie was suspended from his post as he awaited impeachment. Having also received a flogging, he sighed and moaned as he lay on his stomach back at home to nurse his injuries. His son, Pan Lin, was also implicated and had to endure the rebukes of the imperial censors every day during court sessions. A few days later, he was also suspended from his post to be detained and confined at home.Xiao Chiye, having received a raise in rank, organized a banquet and specifically invited the Marquis of Helian. The Marquis of Helian was too embarrassed to appear before Xiao Chiye because of the matchmaking attempt for Commandery Princess Zhaoyue the last time.1\u00a0He was also worried that this tyrant would be so proud of his success that he would humiliate him and make things hard for him before the others. So, after thinking it through, he got his son to attend the banquet on his behalf.Marquis Junior was called Fei Shi. He was also a well-known figure on Donglong Street. He had once gone drinking with Xiao Chiye in the past, but none of them lesser-tyrants were as domineering as mega-tyrant Xiao Chiye. What\u2019s more, he feared the Xiao Clan, so he no longer went out for entertainment with Xiao Chiye and would make a big detour whenever he saw Xiao Chiye and Li Jianheng. Now that he had to attend Xiao Chiye\u2019s banquet, he first wilted by half, then changed direction and headed to the Pan\u2019s Residence to ask Pan Lin to go together with him.\u201cGo with me. We\u2019ll treat it as relieving our boredom!\u201d Fei Shi held up his robe and urged him on. \u201cThe banquet this time is on Kailing River. There\u2019ll be many people there.\u201dPan Lin\u2019s son was just a month old. He teased the baby for a moment before saying, \u201cNot going. I\u2019ve been feeling vexed these few days.\u201d\u201cWhat fun is there in playing with a baby?\u201d Fei Shi squeezed in to intercept the nanny and said, \u201cI can\u2019t skip it this time. My father has specifically made his instructions clear. Go have some fun and make friends with him. I heard that he is friends with the Left Censor-in-chief of the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau, Cen Yu. If he steps forth and intercedes for you, then you wouldn\u2019t have to endure as many rebukes.\u201d\u201cSeriously.\u201d Pan Lin tossed aside the handkerchief. \u201cCen Xunyi\u2019s the one who\u2019s the most brutal in reprimanding me! Xiao the Second only advanced in rank this time owing to his friendship with His Majesty. Just how much can he convince Cen Yu? I\u2019m not going. I don\u2019t want to embarrass myself!\u201d\u201cLook at you. How are you this inflexible?!\u201d Fei Shi was truly racking his brains to coax him out of the door. \u201cHe has a prior friendship with His Majesty. If he can put in a few good words for the Pan Clan before His Majesty, would you still need to be aggrieved to such an extent? Come on, let\u2019s go. I had a drink with him before. I\u2019ll introduce you!\u201dUnable to dissuade Fei Shi, Pan Lin was dragged out of the house and onto the horse carriage, which headed right for Kailing River.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8With Xiao Chiye hosting a banquet this night, all the gaily-painted pleasure boats on Kailing River were full. He was now famous, and all the brothels and taverns along the riverbanks benefited from association, having gotten a piece of the action. Money was being splashed around on the outside like water. He did not even have to open his mouth; flocking all around him were people trying every means to give him money.But there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch in the world.2\u00a0 If he accepted their money, he would have to do them favors. If he did not do it today, then there would be plenty of pretexts for them to get him to do it in the future. Xiao Chiye knew this all too well, so he did not accept a single coin. This was such a grand occasion, and he paid for it all out of his own pocket.Chen Yang flicked away noisily at the abacus in the back behind the scene. The more he computed, the slower he became. Eventually, he simply tossed away the abacus and said to Ding Tao and Gu Jin, \u201cThe palace has rewarded us with so many fields and mansions. Let\u2019s sort them out and find an auspicious day to sell them all.\u201dXiao Chiye just happened to come out after changing his robe. He cut an imposing sight, all decked in a gold crown, brocade robe, and black clouds boots. On hearing Chen Yang, his countenance changed. He felt his way to his belt and said, \u201c\u2026 I\u2019m that poor?\u201d\u201cWe have too many expenses at the start of spring. The villages on the outside are self-sufficient enough to bring in some money. But many residences in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0are bestowed upon us by the palace. We can\u2019t rent them out, and we still have to arrange for someone to clean them daily. Our Prince Residence and Plum Blossom Residence are permanent residences, and there are at least three hundred people or so who serve in both. The monthly salaries, monetary rewards, and\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cAnd Ding Tao\u2019s candy allowance. You have to eat an entire frontier reconnaissance squad\u2019s worth of rations each year, right? We\u2019ve spoiled you too much.\u201dGrabbing his little notebook, Ding Tao did not dare to make noise and merely mumbled, \u201cThe Princess Consort gave special permission for this when I was back at home\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve grown up.\u201d Xiao Chiye said callously. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to eat candies anymore. They are bad for your teeth.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll temporarily hold off on the calculation of the expenses tonight.\u201d Chen Yang held on to the table, feeling a little dizzy. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to dealing with matters.\u201d Gu Jin said succinctly. \u201cA man\u2019s got to be liberal with his money!\u201d\u201cDo a proper audit of the accounts for those residences on the outside. I hardly go there even in a few hundred years, and\u00a0dage\u00a0is too busy to manage them on his end too. When those subordinates go free and unchecked for too long, they would even dare to hoodwink others.\u201d Xiao Chiye strode a long step out, then retreated back and said, \u201cCalculate it now! It won\u2019t be more than a few thousand taels. There\u2019s someone\u2026 managing this account.\u201dGu Jin watched him step out of the door and asked, \u201cWho? Who in our residence can manage how our Second Young Master spends his money?\u201dChen Yang carried the abacus back and flicked through it for a moment before giving an equivocally worded reply.Ding Tao rubbed his boots against each other and stretched out his head to whisper, \u201cI know who it is.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Not many officials were invited to this banquet. Court officials of fourth-grade and above were all subjected to censure from the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0had they gathered for private feasts. Xiao Chiye was also the Viceroy of the\u00a0Imperial Army, so he could not invite any of the few important military officials who worked with him on the patrols. The feast Cen Yu held the last time was also a private feast. He first presented a memo to the Grand Secretariat, and it was only when Hai Liangyi gave his nod that he invited the guests. This was how it ought to be. Kong Qiu, having gotten inebriated that feast, ended up getting censured and had to sit through a lecture from Hai Liangyi.The censors of the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0were the imperial censors, just as described. They could rebuke the emperor at the top and denounce the various officials at the bottom. Even Hai Liangyi himself would receive a censure if he were slightly negligent. For example, during the public ditches incident this time, Hai Liangyi just so happened to hold the posts of the Grand Secretariat\u2019s Deputy Grand Secretary and Grand Secretary in successive order, so he would have to bear the blame had a problem cropped up. In the beginning, when Li Jianheng had just ascended to the throne, he found the dragon throne in Mingli Hall so hard that his buttocks ached if he sat on it for too long. Thus, he griped about it to those in close attendance. Not a few days later, he received a roundabout rebuke from the imperial censors. To this date, he never dared to bring up the matter of padding it with a thick cushion.Xiao Chiye could not invite the \u201cauthorities in power\u201d, but he could invite the \u201cnobles\u201d, or more specifically, the \u201cdistinguished nobles\u201d. As long as it was a person of a hereditary noble rank, he invited them all. Most of these rich young masters with noble titles but no real power had someone in their family to back them, so they could have fun all they want with a peace of mind. One example was Fei Shi. His father was still alive and in good health, and his elder sister was about to marry a man from the Han Clan, so he did not have to worry about his daily essentials like meals and clothing. He was not a good student either, barely learning anything; all he did the whole day was to loaf around.The moment Fei Shi stepped off the sedan, he dragged Pan Lin over to meet Xiao Chiye.\u201cYour Lordship, congratulations!\u201dXie Chiye laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019m glad Your Little Lordship is willing to honor me with your presence today. Please drink all the wine you want tonight.\u201dSeeing how approachable he was, Fei Shi could not help but relax. He said, \u201cYour Lordship is generous. I shall not leave sober tonight!\u201dXiao Chiye looked at Pan Lin and said, \u201cVice Minister Pan, please drink to your heart\u2019s content too. Is His Excellency Pan getting better these days?\u201dHearing his usual tone, Pan Lin, whose heart had been in his mouth, relaxed a little. He returned the greeting and said, \u201cThank you for Your Lordship\u2019s consideration. My father\u2019s health is fine. It\u2019s just that he feels ashamed in the face of His Majesty\u2019s graciousness and has been facing the wall to self-reflect on the errors of his ways these days.\u201dXiao Chiye seemed to sigh with emotion as he said, \u201cHis Excellency Pan is a veteran minister of three reigns. He acts with prudence and is conscientious in his handling of state affairs. It\u2019s truly a pity for him to meet with such an unexpected misfortune.\u201dPan Lin had been suffering setbacks day after day. He had pleaded with a great number of people to intercede on their behalf and have their sentences reduced. Other than the Fei Clan, who still had the heart to help them out of their difficulty, the others all came up with every kind of excuse to turn him away. He was born a\u00a0di\u00a0\u2013 a legitimate descendant \u2013 of a noble clan, and his career had been pretty much smooth sailing. It was only now he had a taste of the world and found out just how fickle and hypocritical society3\u00a0was. Thus, he was greatly surprised and touched by Xiao Chiye\u2019s words.\u201cMy father\u2026\u201d Pan Lin felt emotional, but knowing the etiquette, he forced a smile and said, \u201cForget it. I\u2019m here tonight to congratulate and celebrate Your Lordship\u2019s great happiness, so let\u2019s not mention anything else. Your Lordship, congratulations!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just blessed to have His Majesty shower kindness and favor upon me. All I did was to carry out the task of rolling and crawling around in the mud. I can\u2019t be compared to the Vice Minister and His Excellency Pan, who worry about the state all day long. Chen Yang.\u201d Xiao Chiye turned aside. \u201cInvite His Little Lordship and Vice Minister Pan onto the boat and serve them well.\u201dChen Yang bowed and respectfully led them both inside. One side of the ship\u2019s interior was draped with hanging sheer fabric, and the sound of pipa flowed into the night. The seats were arranged according to levels of superiority. Chen Yang led them both to the seats of honor. Seated at this table were all descendants from the noble clans.Pan Lin saw a few acquaintances, but he did not greet them. Seeing the unfriendly atmosphere, Fei Shi hurriedly got up to mediate. He said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this Eldest Young Master Xue? What a truly rare sight!\u201dXue Xiuyi was Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s elder brother of lawful birth. But this person had neither talents nor brains and relied solely on his birth to trample over Xue Xiuzhuo for many years.4\u00a0He was an ambitious man, and now, after seeing the Pan Clan on the decline, he was starting to give Pan Lin the cold shoulder.Xue Xiuzhuo drank his wine and merely said, \u201cHmph. And how is the Little Lordship doing?\u201dFei Shi jabbed his fan and said, \u201cMe? Not too bad. What has the Eldest Young Master been doing lately? Come out for some fun!\u201dLooking haughty, Xue Xiuyi said, \u201cI\u2019m busy. Been studying some books that are the only copy extant from the previous reign.\u201dFei Shi smiled and said, \u201cMy, my. The Eldest Young Master is a man of great talent. So why do you have time today?\u201dAll this while, Xue Xiuyi had his side to them, as unwilling as he was to look Pan Lin in the eye. He said, \u201cI heard Yao Wenyu has returned to the capital. I thought I should be able to see him here tonight, so I came. There are some issues I need to talk to him about.\u201dPan Lin had been tolerating him for a long time. Seeing this attitude of his, he promptly sneered and said, \u201cNot necessarily so. The queue of people who want to pick Yuanzhuo\u2019s brain stretches all the way to Hongyan Mountain in accordance with their learning and accomplishments. It\u2019s pointless even if the Eldest Young Master hangs around here waiting; it\u2019s still far from your turn!\u201dWhat Xiu Xiuyi hated the most was the others making a dig at him for his lack of talents and shallow knowledge. He promptly set down the wine cup and said in a frosty voice, \u201cFine. I\u2019m not worthy. But I still have a little self-awareness of my own limitations. I know my own worth. I know whether or not I\u2019m deserving of sitting in this position!\u201dAt his double-edged remark, Pan Lin abruptly rose to his feet.Xue Xiuyi had a mean mouth, and he sneered when he saw Pan Lin go red in the face. Instead of being enraged, he chose some scathing remarks to throw out, \u201cCome on, Chengzhi, take a seat. Why? Are there nails on this chair? Everyone on this boat is looking at you. You are basking in glory tonight\u2014Your Pan Clan has indeed been impressive lately, even more so than the time you had a son!\u201dPan Lin\u2019s first wife had previously died of illness, and there were a few times his concubines got pregnant only to suffer miscarriages. Seeing that he was already over thirty years of age and was still without a son, Old Madam Pan went vegetarian and prayed to Buddha while also seeking all over for prescriptions. In order for him to beget a son,5\u00a0she stuffed batch after batch of women into his room, causing such a hoo-ha that everyone knew about it and mocked Pan Lin behind his back for having an unmentionable affliction.Rage overwhelmed Pan Lin. He trembled and pointed at Xue Xiuyi, so furious was he that he gasped for breath and sputtered, \u201cYou, you\u2026 and what the hell do you think you are?! You let the common son beneath you take charge and manage the household affairs. You\u2019re simply, simply\u2026 as dumb as a boorish boar!\u201dXue Xiuyi slapped the table and rose to retort, \u201cYou shut up! You are a disgrace to the educated class! You know dogshit!\u201dPan Lin countered, \u201cYou\u2019re even worse than a beast!\u201dSandwiched in the middle, Fei Shi held on to his teacup as he was splattered with a faceful of spittle. He closed his eyes and yelled, \u201cWhat the heck?! Eldest Young Master, Chengzhi, stop quarreling! Why ruin a good banquet\u2014\u201dXue Xiuyi said, \u201cDon\u2019t put me in the same category as him. He\u2019s not worthy. He doesn\u2019t even deserve to carry my shoes!\u201dPan Lin looked to his left and right, then picked up the teacup and smashed it. This entire table was thrown into chaos. Fei Shi could not stop them. Both of them showed utterly no regard for their dignity as they tangled and fought with one another.Xue Xiuyi stayed at home all year round. He was small-sized and thin, and he was not skilled at fistfights and kickboxing. Subsequently, he was shoved to the ground by Pan Lin and ended up banging his waist hard. He repeatedly wailed, \u201cOwow\u2026 To think you dare to hit me, you!\u201dPan Lin had nothing left to smash, so he took off his shoe and swung it to swat it right at his face, saying, \u201cI\u2019m teaching you a lesson on behalf of Old Master Xue! The hell you think you are. Your foul mouth ought to be slapped!\u201dThere was an uproar all around. Fei Shi dodged that shoe and said urgently, \u201cStop fighting! Quick, stop it! Men, men!\u201dXiao Chiye lifted the curtain and entered, his expression growing grave. Chen Yang led the guards forth to stop them and pulled both men apart.Xue Xiuyi had been smacked until there were red marks on his face. He covered his face and stretched out his leg, wanting to kick Pan Lin. With his neck craned, he spat out hatefully, \u201cWe aren\u2019t done yet. This is not over!\u201dPan Lin was truly a sorry sight to behold. He had come to his senses now; he never expected to make a clown of himself in public. Avoiding all the eyes on him and enduring his misery, he said resolutely, \u201cEven if I, Pan Chengzhi, were to starve to death in the future, I\u2019ll never sit at the same table as you, Xue Xiuyi! And even if our Pan Clan of Dancheng were to die out, I\u2019ll never beg your Xue Clan for help!\u201dWith that, Pan Lin tossed the shoe to the floor. He raised his head, but did not look at anyone, and merely cupped his hands before his chest to Xiao Chiye.\u201cI, Pan Chengzhi, will compensate Your Lordship for spoiling Your Lordship\u2019s fun! And I, Pan Chengzhi, will also pay you back double for all the things I\u2019ve smashed tonight! Not only that, I, Pan Chengzhi, will even book this entire Kailing River for Your Lordship to have fun! Your Lordship, I shall take my leave! I\u2019ll come calling on you another day to offer my apologies!\u201dHe kicked off his other shoe too. And just like that, he stepped over the mess on the ground in his clean socks and pushed Fei Shi aside to make his way out.\u201cYour Excellency, please wait.\u201d Xiao Chiye said in an unhurried tone. \u201cChen Yang, take the Vice Minister to have a change of clothes first.\u201dFei Shi hurriedly said, \u201cRight, right, Chengzhi! Let\u2019s get your clothes changed first!\u201dWhen all was said and done, Pan Lin was, after all, a noble clan young master. What\u2019s more, he was an authorized official of the imperial court. He had to speak tough, but if he really had to walk on the streets in this state, it would have been better to kill him. So, with Chen Yang and Fei Shi urging him on, he relented and went with them.\u201cEldest Young Master.\u201d Xiao Chiye lifted a finger to beckon Gu Jin over. He motioned, \u201cAfter you, too.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 : Individual ServingsPan Lin was in a depressed state of mind as he sat on the couch near the window after he had a change of clothes. Feeling guilty, Fei Shi sat before him and made to speak, only to have the words die on his lips.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say a word.\u201d Pan Lin looked out of the window at the old but brilliantly-lit brothel courtyard. \u201cIt\u2019s just my bad luck to come across a lowlife like him.\u201dFei Shi said, \u201cYou know he\u2019s a lowlife who has an extremely narrow mind. Then why get angry with someone like him? Chengzhi, it\u2019s not worth it.\u201dPan Lin let out a self-mocking laugh and said, \u201cHas our Pan Clan fallen into such a sorry state? I can give up my moral integrity had it been for the sake of a meal. But I\u2019d rather die than to let him mock me like this.\u201dSeeing how sorrowful he looked, Fei Shi knew that the social snubbing these days had really hurt him. Although Fei Shi was a loafer, he was pretty much a person who took it easy. He comforted, \u201cAs long as the green hills remain, one need not fear a lack of firewood to burn\u2014Where there\u2019s life, there\u2019s hope. His Majesty has not even issued the edict yet! Chengzhi, didn\u2019t His Lordship say so? His Excellency Pan is a veteran minister of three reigns. He\u2019d still carry some weight in His Majesty\u2019s heart.\u201dOn the other side, Gu Jin lifted the curtain, and Xiao Chiye bent over to enter. Fei Shi and Pan Lin stood up together to pay their obeisances to him.Xiao Chiye raised his hand and said, \u201cGentlemen, there\u2019s no need to stand on ceremony. Your Excellency Pan, please take a seat.\u201dPan Lin took his seat and said to Xiao Chiye, \u201cNot only have I ruined Your Lordship\u2019s fun tonight, but I\u2019ve also held Your Lordship up from enjoying the wine. I deserve a beating.\u201dXiao Chiye did not really mind. As he sat, Gu Jin served him tea. He took a few sips and said, \u201cI\u2019ve long heard of Your Excellency\u2019s talents, but I have never had the chance to strike up a conversation. It could be said to be fate and luck that brought us here tonight.\u201dOn hearing this, Fei Shi smiled and threw Pan Lin a signal with his eyes.Pan Lin hurriedly bowed. Xiao Chiye motioned for him to take a seat again and said, \u201cI was the one who carried out the task of dredging up the public ditches, so I know very well how it feels. The public ditches on Donglong Street were old to begin with, having been haphazardly dug before His Excellency Pan took up the post of Minister of Works. There are too many points in this matter that don\u2019t make sense. If you ask me, the blame for the rise in water level this time shouldn\u2019t be pinned on His Excellency Pan.\u201dA surge of warmth welled up in Pan Lin\u2019s heart. He said, \u201cA few years ago, my father specifically asked someone to draw up a blueprint. But the Zhongbo troops just happened to suffer a defeat back then, and the state treasury lacked money. The Ministry of Revenue refused to allocate the funds, so this matter was passed over. Who would have known\u2026 sigh!\u201d\u201cTo think there\u2019s still such a thing.\u201d Xiao Chiye covered the teacup with the tea lid. \u201cBut Wei Huaigu didn\u2019t mention a word about this before the emperor. Aren\u2019t both your families on good terms with one another?\u201dPan Lin said nothing, and Fei Shi hastened to say, \u201cYour Lordship, why is that Wei Huaigu is going all out to curry favors? It\u2019s all for the sake of being a top-league official. He endured for all these years, finally becoming qualified enough and just in time for the inspection this year. He\u2019s waiting for the evaluation to be submitted so that he can be promoted to Deputy Secretary; this is so he can stand up to Secretariat Elder Hai as equals on the imperial court in the future. No one expected the public ditches to end up clogged at this juncture. Of course, he has to think of ways to disassociate himself from it. He\u2019s not the slightest bit willing to shoulder the responsibility for this at all.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect him to be such a person.\u201d Xiao Chiye looked slightly surprised. \u201cHaving seen how the Ministry of Revenue\u2019s accounts these years have been clear without any glaring errors, I initially thought that it should be Wei Huaigu\u2019s turn for a promotion this year. But who would have known that he would turn out to be such a vile person who seeks personal gains this shamelessly? What happened to His Excellency Pan is truly unfortunate.\u201dHearing the hint of appreciation in his words, Fei Shi could not resist plucking up the courage to say, \u201cEveryone has been pretty much closemouthed about the information lately. Your Lordship, Chengzhi and I had asked quite a number of people, and we still don\u2019t know what punishment His Majesty has conveyed to the Ministry of Justice. If His Excellency were to be sentenced\u2026 would be he assigned out of\u00a0Qudu?\u201dWith his heart in his mouth, Pan Lin looked at Xiao Chiye.Xiao Chiye sat tight in the chair and twiddled with his thumb ring. Only when he had them on the edges of their seats that he said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. His Majesty seems to me to be hesitating too.\u201dFei Shi promptly said, \u201cAs long as the imperial edict has not been issued, there\u2019s still a chance to turn things around. Your Lordship is truly an official in the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u2019s inner ministerial circle now! I hope Your Lordship can put in a few good words to His Majesty regarding this issue.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t put in a good word for His Excellency Pan.\u201d Seeing both men\u2019s expressions change, Xiao Chiye continued unhurriedly, \u201cI\u2019ll only speak the truth. His Excellency is talented and has made contributions to the state. Even if he has made some minor mistakes, it does not merit execution or banishment. I\u2019ll speak to His Majesty again when I enter the palace tomorrow. If all goes well, the pardon should arrive at your residences within four days.\u201dPan Lin was so delighted that his eyes reddened when he stood up. He did not dare to overstep his boundary and touch Xiao Chiye, so he could only grasp his own sleeves and fall to his knees hard as though he was transplanting rice seedlings and said, \u201cMany thanks\u2026 many thanks to Your Lordship for saving our lives!\u201d\u201cGu Jin, quick, help the Vice Minister up.\u201d Xiao Chiye said with a smile, \u201cThis is what I should do. There\u2019s no need for Your Excellency to take it to heart. When you return today, tell His Excellency Pan to rest well. There are plenty of state and governmental affairs where His Excellency is still needed in the future.\u201dFei Shi, who was frank and outspoken, said, \u201cIf there is anything we can do for Your Lordship in the future, please just say the word! Chengzhi, let\u2019s go. We have to head back and tell His Excellency the good news!\u201dPan Lin thanked him again and said to Xiao Chiye with sincerity, \u201cPlease let me know if I can be of help to Your Lordship in the future! Libei is too far; I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help you there. But as long as it\u2019s in\u00a0Qudu, I, Pan Chengzhi, will definitely do my utmost as long as Your Lordship gives the word!\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to act like a stranger. However, you mentioned earlier that His Excellency Pan had found someone to draw up a blueprint for the public ditches of\u00a0Qudu. I also happen to be worrying about the repairs for the public ditches. So could I trouble you to ask His Excellency Pan if he could lend me the blueprint for a look?\u201dPan Lin said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to ask. I\u2019ll send someone to deliver it right to Your Lordship\u2019s residence once I return home.\u201dXiao Chiye comforted him some more, then watched as Gu Jin sent them off the boat. He listened to the reed pipes music from the pleasure boat for a moment before turning back to say to Ding Tao, \u201cEat what you like. Tell the cook to go ahead and dish it up. Once you\u2019re done eating, prepare some sweet and spicy dishes, then get the cook to grill some fishes carefully and have it delivered to your Young Master Shen. Don\u2019t alert anyone else.\u201dWith his notebook in his bag, Ding Tao ran off. Chen Yang came up from behind and said to Xiao Chiye in a hushed tone, \u201cMaster, Xue Xiuyi isn\u2019t going to stay for long inside; he\u2019s still waiting to see Yao Wenyu. Are we going over?\u201d\u201cYes. Of course, we are going over.\u201d Xiao Chiye looked back with icy cold eyes, \u201cXue Xiuzhuo planted a time-bomb for me in the Quancheng silk matter. I have to give him a big gift in return. Tell the attendants to serve a few more pots of excellent wine. This Xue Xiuyi is of great use to us.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8The prison, which fell under the charge of Kong Qiu, was strictly monitored, so Xi Hongxuan could not send out any information. It was as if he was cut off from the world. The more he waited, the more anxious he became. After waking up one night, he found himself detained in isolation, having been swapped over to a windowless room.\u201cWhy is there a sudden change in place?\u201d Because Xi Hongxuan was obese, he could not squat down as freely as he would like. All he could do was to bend over slightly and call out through the gap to the warden who was delivering his food, \u201cBro! Sir! At least tell me something.\u201dThat warden paid no attention to his words and opened the flap to push the rancid rice and leftover soup in. Then he picked up the tray and left.\u201cAy, buddy, please hold it!\u201d Xi Hongxuan raised his voice. \u201cI still have some silver in my pocket. Looking at how hard you\u2019ve been working these few days, why not take it to buy some wine? Consider it my show of respect1\u00a0to you!\u201dThe warden turned back and spat a mouthful of saliva at him.Snubbed, Xi Hongxuan sat on the straw mat in a daze without even taking his meal. He could not even sleep well these few days he had been waiting. He thought it over from different angles, but he did not where it had all gone wrong. The more time lapsed, the more uncertain he felt. This taste of being subjected to the whims of another was simply too hard to take.This room was damp, with no ducts for ventilation and no windows to let in light. Xi Hongxuan would usually find it tough to sleep even on bamboo mats, and now, it was even more of a torture for him. Eczema had broken out on his back again, and he could not reach it even if he wanted to scratch.Later, Xi Hongxuan heard a movement at the entrance. The door creaked open, and Shen Zechuan strode in. Behind him, Qiao Tianya, who was disguised as a stoic-faced youth, lit the lamp.Xi Hongxuan struggled to move his legs and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why am I locked up here? Is this Kong Qiu\u2019s idea? I\u2019ve never heard of there being such a room in prison!\u201d\u201cYou are not a long-staying convict of the prison, so it\u2019s only right that you don\u2019t know about this place.\u201d Shen Zechuan pulled off his cloak and handed it to Qiao Tianya, then said to Xi Hongxuan, \u201cThe food here is not fit for human consumption. I\u2019ve specially prepared some dishes. Eat some, and we\u2019ll talk.\u201dWith the cloak hanging over one of his hands, Qiao Tianya opened up the food box with his other hand and served up the delicacies they had bought earlier on the way here.Xi Hongxuan sat on the straw mat and watched Qiao Tianya\u2019s movements in silence when he suddenly let out a laugh. His expression quickly cooled off, and he said, \u201cThis looks like a farewell dinner.\u201d\u201cThis case doesn\u2019t merit a death sentence, so why scare yourself?\u201d Shen Zechuan sat down on the bench that Qiao Tianya had dusted clean. When he noticed that Xi Hongxuan had not moved his chopsticks, he got Qiao Tianya to take out another pair of chopsticks. Then, he picked a few dishes to eat before sampling a mouthful of wine.It was only then Xi Hongxuan moved his chopsticks.Shen Zechuan set down the chopsticks and looked at him. He said with a smile, \u201cWe are brothers. Do you have to be so tightly guarded against me?\u201dXi Hongxuan picked out the steamed twisted roll and gobbled them down. It was only after his hunger subsided that he said, \u201cTimes are special. If you were in my shoe, won\u2019t you act the same way? How did that matter go? Have you seen Xi Dan?\u201dShen Zechuan finished up the wine in his cup and nodded to Qiao Tianya. Qiao Tianya opened the door and led the man in.\u201cSecond Young Master!\u201d Xi Dan pounced in. When he saw Xi Hongxuan, he lowered his head and wept, \u201cYou have suffered!\u201dSteadying his hand, Xi Hongxuan drank up the last drop of wine and said, \u201cGet up! Don\u2019t make a fool of yourself! It\u2019s not the time for me to meet my maker yet!\u201dWiping his face, Xi Dan said, \u201cDuring these few days when the Second Young Master was not at home, I\u2019ve already informed the shopkeepers of the various areas to manage their accounts carefully. I wouldn\u2019t dare to let them mess up. But you\u2019re the pillar of the clan. We still need you to take charge of the affairs personally.\u201dXi Hongxuan ate his dishes in silence. After a long while, he said, \u201cTell me the situation out there.\u201dXi Dan replied, \u201cHis Majesty wants to pursue responsibility for the matter, and both the Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of Works do not want to shoulder the blame. At present, Pan Xiangjie has already been suspended, and he has already received a flogging. Seeing as the situation did not bode well, I went to plead with His Excellency Xue, but he was too busy with his official duties that I did not manage to get to see him at all!\u201d\u201cYanqing did not see you?\u201d Xi Hongxuan suddenly threw his chopsticks away and looked at Xi Dan with slightly narrowed eyes. \u201cAre you telling the truth?\u201dOn seeing his disbelief, Xi Dan hurriedly said, \u201cSecond Young Master, how can this be falsified? All you have to do is to ask when you are released to find out the truth, isn\u2019t it? How do I dare to hoodwink you when it comes to such matters?! Doesn\u2019t this coincide with His Majesty\u2019s issuance of general amnesty? The Court of Judicial Review is going to coordinate with the Ministry of Justice to leaf through all the past old cases. His Excellency Xue has to go through the files with Kong Qiu and the others. I don\u2019t dare to block his sedan chair either, and that\u2019s why I never got a chance to meet him.\u201dIt was only when Xi Dan explained it in this way that Xi Hongxuan more or less believed him. He said, \u201cWhat rotten luck to be framed at this kind of timing\u2026 Lanzhou, exactly who instigated His Majesty to leave the palace? Is there still no update from the palace regarding this matter?\u201d\u201cThere are only so many people around His Majesty, so just throw out a guess.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cBut it\u2019s obvious His Majesty is reluctant to investigate. He\u2019s clearly of the mind to protect the other party.\u201d\u201cMu Ru is the only one who can make His Majesty protect her to such an extent.\u201d Xi Hongxuan clenched his fists. \u201cBitch is ruthless. There must be a reason for her to do so. You have to be careful\u2026 She\u2019d better not be pregnant with an imperial heir and eyeing the throne to rule behind the screen!\u201d2\u201cSince she is in Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s camp, I doubt she will conceive that easily.\u201d Once again, Shen Zechuan brought up the past. \u201cIt was also Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s idea for you to transfer to the Bureau of Evaluations. If it\u2019s indeed the case that Mu Ru wanted to harm you\u2026 I can no longer get what Xue Xiuzhuo is thinking.\u201dOn the day Xi Hongxuan abducted Qi Huilian, Shen Zechuan had also mentioned that it was Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s idea for him to enter the Bureau of Evaluations. Now that he had brought it up again half a month later, the implication of his words had taken on a different undertone.Xi Hongxuan pondered it over for a while, then said, \u201cLet\u2019s leave these matters aside for the time being. Lanzhou, the priority is to get me out of here. What did Wei Huaigu say? How much does he want? I\u2019ll give him!\u201dShen Zechuan extended four fingers.Xi Hongxuan said, \u201c400,000?\u201dShen Zechuan did not move.Xi Hongxuan propped himself up on the table and stood up. He exclaimed, \u201c4,000,000?!\u201dThe dishes and bowls on the table collided. Xi Hongxuan\u2019s expression under the lamp gradually grew savage. He flung the wine cup without warning and seethed, \u201cGood one there, Wei Huaigu\u2026 Well-played, the Wei Clan! So, four million\u2026\u201dHe began to laugh grimly.\u201cThis is the total military expenditure of Dazhou; it\u2019s almost as much as the cost of rebuilding Zhongbo! So much money. Fuck. How\u2019s he going to get it? That\u2019s truly a real mountain of silver. It would take half a year just to transport it separately from the west! And it\u2019ll also cost money to bribe the various passes and checkpoints during this period of time when the money is being escorted across territories! Even if the money makes its way to\u00a0Qudu, where is he going to store it? There\u2019s simply no way to hide this much money!\u201d\u201cWhat he is doing now is ripping you off by making such an exorbitant demand, so why would he care that much? The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0have just gotten the news that the Wei Clan indeed has their eyes on Zhongbo. Think about it. Wei Huaigu currently has the Ministry of Revenue in his grasp. If he manages to take down the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo, then this sum of money would be really used on military expenses. By the time the Wei Clan has their own troops, and\u2026 with the Empress Dowager\u2026 then the Xi Clan would be at their mercy.\u201dXi Hongxuan suddenly turned his head to look at Shen Zechuan, \u201cWhen you advised me to join forces with them back then, have you ever thought that this would happen today? Lanzhou! These people are all wolves and tigers; they are all insatiably greedy. The moment they have us in their hands, then you and I will never be able to get back on our feet again in this lifetime!\u201d\u201cBack then, when I advised you to join forces with them and kick out the Yao Clan, you hesitated. The Yao Clan was initially a good target for you to punish as a warning to others. You missed the chance, so the situation today is only to be expected. Xi Hongxuan, if you don\u2019t kick them, then they will think of ways to boot you out.\u201d As if lamenting, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cThis situation is ever so fast-changing. It\u2019s no longer the same as it was decades ago when everyone could still talk reason to one another. The\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0is such that one clan rises when another falls. It\u2019s wearing down from within. You should have long swallowed up the others and declare yourself king.\u201dXi Hongxuan\u2019s breathing quickened slightly. At this very moment, he regretted his inaction. His palms were drenched in sweat as he faced the flickering candlelight and said, \u201cLanzhou\u2026 When I get out this time, I\u2019ll heed your advice in all future plans! Since it has already come to this now, we have to think of a way first to get those four million\u2026\u201d\u201cFour million is still too much.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cThere\u2019s simply no way for that much money passing through Juexi to escape Jiang Qingshan\u2019s eyes. Wait a little longer. I\u2019m going to negotiate with Wei Huaigu.\u201dAt this point, there was no other choice but to wait. Holding himself back, Xi Hongxuan said, \u201cIt\u2019d be best to hurry. The situation in the imperial court changes too fast. What\u2019s more, His Majesty is indecisive and doesn\u2019t have a mind on his own. If Xiao the Second or Mu Ru were to coax and win him over, then it\u2019ll really be too late.\u201dIt was inadvisable for Shen Zechuan to stay too long. As he put on his cloak, he asked, as if offhandedly, \u201cOh, right. You are in prison, then what about Qi Huilian? He\u2019s important too, so don\u2019t let anyone see him.\u201dXi Hongxuan was about to say something, but he changed his mind in a split second. He softened his voice as he said to Shen Zechuan, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry. Qi Huilian will not starve to death. I\u2019ve found someone to watch over him. It\u2019s just that the place is well-concealed. I\u2019ll return him to you when I get out of here.\u201dIt was under this dim light that Shen Zechuan partially turned his head back with a hint of a smile in the uplifted corners of his eyes. As he secured his cloak, he softly said, \u201cSure.\u201dA cold draft of wind slipped in through the crack between the door, causing the hairs on Xi Hongxuan to stand on ends. He rubbed his arms, wanting to say a few words more to reassure him, but Shen Zechuan had already stridden out of the door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 : CluesA cacophony of human voices hung over Kailing River. Xue Xiuyi sat cross-legged on the couch, cracking peanut shells and drinking wine. When Xiao Chiye entered, he hurriedly brushed his robe clean and got off the couch to pay his obeisances to Xiao Chiye.Xiao Chiye sat directly opposite Xue Xiuyi, and Chen Yang came over to pour wine. Xue Xiuyi placed his fingers at the sides of his legs and subconsciously rubbed them on his robe to wipe his hands. At the same time, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough, that\u2019s enough\u2026 Your Lordship, too much of this wine is bad for your health!\u201dHolding the cup, Xiao Chiye said to him with a smile, \u201cThe Eldest Young Master is quite meticulous. You must be diligent in keeping yourself in good health back in your residence, right?\u201d\u201cOnly a little.\u201d Xue Xiuyi did not dare to take his seat without explicit permission. He was short and small-sized to begin with, and hunching over to Xiao Chiye in a bow made him look even more humble and lowly.Xiao Chiye cordially said, \u201cPlease sit. I\u2019ll still have the Eldest Young Master\u2019s advice to seek.\u201dWith his backside at the edge of the couch, Xue Xiuyi said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare to be so presumptuous as to offer advice.\u201dXiao Chiye noted from Xue Xiuyi\u2019s appearance that the latter was clearly poles apart from Xue Xiuzhuo. For Xue Xiuzhuo to have to submit to such an elder brother, it was only natural for him to be unable to take it lying down.\u201cIt has been a while since I last saw His Excellency Yanqing.\u201d Xiao Chiye drank his wine. \u201cI heard that he has been busy investigating cases with Minister Kong. It has been hard on him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only because the Secretariat Elder has promoted him that he\u2019s basking in glory now.\u201d Xiu Xiuyu had long disliked Xue Xiuzhuo. He had been making things difficult in all kinds of ways possible for this younger common-born brother of his, but a pity Xue Xiuzhuo had always been like a cotton that cushioned all his damages and made all his efforts come to naught.\u201cHe\u2019s the Eldest Young Master\u2019s younger brother of common birth. According to customs, the one leading the way to join the ranks of officials in the imperial court should be the Eldest Young Master. So why is it the other way round in your household?\u201dXue Xiuyi accepted the wine, not daring to refuse it. He had already lost his sense of propriety after downing a few cups and was now feeling the earth spinning at his feet. At Xiao Chiye\u2019s question, he gripped the cup and said with a snort, \u201cWell, he has the capability, no? Your Lordship doesn\u2019t know it, but he has always been one since young to ingratiate himself with men in power for personal gains. He\u2019s a shrewd and deep one! There was heavy snow in the year he was born. When the time came for him to be named with the generation name1\u00a0\u2018xiu\u2019, he was supposed to be named \u2018gui\u2019, but a Daoist priest predicted that he would meet an extremely distinguished benefactor in his life, and calling him by this name would instead prove to be adverse. His birth mother, who was a resourceful woman, fawned upon our Old Master in all ways possible, pleading for him to be named with a \u2018zhuo\u2019 instead. As in, cultivation of virtues and outstanding capabilities,2\u00a0with the courtesy name3\u00a0Yanqing. He sure has a charmed life\u2026\u201dXue Xiuyi\u2019s eyes dimmed when he spoke to this point.Xiao Chiye comforted him. \u201cEldest Young Master, why contend with him? You are the eldest lawful son of the Xue Clan; you are way more esteemed than him.\u201d4His words hit right at Xue Xiuyi\u2019s sore point, making him feel stifled. Sure enough, Xue Xiuyi set down his cup and let out a long sigh.\u201cYour Lordship\u2026\u201d Xue Xiuyi was already drunk, and subsequently, he grew bolder. \u201cYou are the second son of lawful birth of the Prince of Libei. There is no one of common birth to pose as a threat to you, so you are unaware of the specifics. People like us fear having a capable younger brother of common birth back at home. He\u2019s of lowly birth, yet he\u2019s a notch above me. Whether it\u2019s at home or out there, who doesn\u2019t praise him to the skies? What is this? How am I supposed to live with this? Look at the\u00a0Eight Great Clans. Which of them has a descendant of common birth as the head of the clan? How is it that only our Xue Clan has produced a Xue Xiuzhuo?!\u201dIt was all because of his own selfish desires that he detested Xue Xiuzhuo this much. But then, it was also precisely all because of Xue Xiuzhuo that the Xue Clan was able to make a comeback and secure its position among the\u00a0Eight Great Clans. Just the heirs born to the principal wives in the Xue Clan alone numbered in the hundreds, all of which took on the label of being a \u201clawful son\u201d. Beneath them, there were also countless common sons born by the concubines. All the momentous family occasions such as marriages and funerals, monthly salaries and monetary rewards, expenses for living in separate residences, as well as taxes and costs for the country estates, came from the Xue Clan\u2019s coffers and assets.Initially, Old Master Xue planned to support Xue Xiuyi and let this eldest son of lawful birth of his take charge of the household as well as manage the family affairs. But the latter was either engrossed with cultivating the way of immortality or lavishing money on undeserving imposters and swindlers. It was just like what the Empress Dowager had said in the beginning. The descendants of the current Xue generation were all worthless good-for-nothings. Other than Xue Xiuzhuo, who was of common birth, there was no one else worthy of notice.At present, Xue Xiuzhuo was the Court of Judicial Review Assistant Minister. At the same time, he was also the head of the Xue Clan. In these few years, he managed to put a stop to the downward decline of the Xue Clan and secured its position among the noble clans. He had plenty of brothers at home who simply loafed around and contributed nothing, and he still had both paternal and maternal uncles up there who devised schemes all day to cheat the clan out of money. All of them lived off Xue Xiuzhuo even as they spat at him, shamelessly seeking personal gains on the sly while cursing him for being of too lowly a birth.Xiao Chiye was perfectly well aware of this. He had the same thinking as Shen Zechuan, and that was, if not for their uncertainty in where Xue Xiuzhuo stood since he had all along been hiding behind the noble clans, then they, valuing talents, would have been willing to pull this person over to their side. The Quancheng silk incident was the key.; it obscured Shen Zechuan\u2019s vision of Xue Xiuzhuo, turning him into a person they must guard against\u2014A man who was so astute and shrewd to the extent that he had already planted hundreds of thousands of threads of puppet strings as a precaution for future planning long before everything happened was no doubt someone who would not easily put himself at the disposal of another.When Xiao Chiye, who was stroking his wine cup, thought to this point, he said, \u201cAs long as you are human, there will be times you will be down on your luck. There\u2019s no need for the Eldest Young Master to be too anxious over this. He seems to me to be doing a pretty good job of attending to official duties at the Secretariat Elder and Minister Kong\u2019s side. And he typically doesn\u2019t go drinking or fool around with the other; he\u2019s a decent person who knows his place.\u201dXue Xiuyi immediately got all worked up. His wine-induced hiccups persisted, and he covered his nose and mouth for a moment to compose himself before he impatiently said, \u201cThat\u2019s all just an act! Your Lordship, you know of the Twin Flowers on Donglong Street, right? That\u2019s Ouhua Pavilion and Xiangyun Villa! A few years back, Xue Xiuzhuo bought a batch of people from Xiangyun villa and hid them in the residence to groom!\u201dXiao Chiye suddenly smelled something fishy when he heard Xiangyun Villa mentioned. His gaze sharpened as he repeated in a lowered voice, \u201cHe bought people from Xiangyun Villa?\u201d\u201cHe did!\u201d Xiu Xiuyi extended his fingers. \u201cHe bought over ten\u2026 boys\u2026 and girls\u2026 all from Xiangyun Villa!\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Xiao Chiye rose and said, \u201cChen Yang, keep Eldest Young Master company. I think it\u2019s about time for Yao Wenyu to arrive. I\u2019ll go welcome him.\u201dThe moment Xue Xiuyi heard Yao Wenyu\u2019s name, he sat upright and repeatedly stated his agreement, not daring to pester or bother him further.As soon as Xiao Chiye stepped out of the door, he shouted, \u201cGu Jin!\u201dGu Jin dropped down from above, got down on one knee, and said, \u201cSecond Young Master!\u201dXiao Chiye questioned, \u201cHow did you not find out Xiangyun sold over ten people to the Xue Clan when I told you to investigate Xiangyun Villa earlier?\u201dStunned, Gu Jin did not dare to raise his head and promptly said, \u201cI beseech Young Master to punish me!\u201dIn the previous assassination case, Xiangyun switched sides and provided falsified evidence of Xiao Chiye accepting bribes. This matter was fishy. Their investigations to this date threw up no clues as to why Xiangyun suddenly threw in her lot with the noble clans. Xue Xiuzhuo was no womanizer or lecher, so exactly what secret was there in his buying of so many people from Xiangyun Villa and taking them back to his residence to hide without so much a word of it all this while?Shen Zechuan was right.Even if Xue Xiuzhuo had nothing to do with it, he had already appeared in every single incident ever since the Nanlin Hunting Grounds episode, perhaps even before the Nanlin Hunting Grounds incident.\u201cOf course, you should be punished. You have drunk quite the volume of wine ever since you came to the capital. Have you drunk yourself so drunk that even those eagle eyes of yours now have gone blind? No doubt you ought to be heavily punished for your incompetence and dereliction of duty. Go on your own to ask Chen Yang for a whipping!\u201dGu Jin started sweating profusely.Xiao Chiye handed Gu Jin\u2019s this job because he appreciated Gu Jin\u2019s meticulousness in his work, and Gu Jin was also the most skilled in conducting searches. As a former scout in the Libei Armored Cavalry, he had never made such an oversight. Xiao Chiye was right. He had stayed in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0for so long that he even dared to take his assignments lightly.\u201cI give you two days to run another check. Get to the bottom of the number of people Xiangyun sold to Xue Xiuzhuo, their names, places of origins and ages, and even who their parents and distant relatives are.\u201d Xiao Chiye strode past him and said in a frosty tone, \u201cMake another oversight, and you need not remain in this position anymore.\u201dGu Jin said nothing and kowtowed, then he rose to his feet and headed for Xiangyun Villa.Chen Yang, having gotten freed up, came out and saw Xiao Chiye\u2019s displeased expression. Thus, he said, \u201cMaster, Xue Xiuyi is taking a rest now.\u201d\u201cGet someone to send him back tomorrow morning.\u201d Xiao Chiye turned back to cast a glance inside. \u201cThere is a set of rare books that are the only extant copies in the Plum Blossom Residence. Give it to him when you send him away tomorrow morning.\u201dChen Yang reminded him. \u201cThose are the Yao Clan\u2019s collection of books. Should we inform Young Master Yao?\u201d\u201cYao Wenyu sold the Plum Blossom Residence to me, that means he has already decided that he doesn\u2019t want them anymore. For most part of the year, he\u2019s out there traveling and living in foreign lands. He doesn\u2019t care for these.\u201d Xiao Chiye had drunk a large amount of wine this night, yet he did not seem to be drunk. He tossed aside the handkerchief he used to wipe his hands. \u201cBesides, even if he returned to the capital, he\u2019s so elusive that it\u2019s hard to get hold or even catch a glimpse of him. He will definitely not attend a banquet like this. This is not an easy man to invite.\u201d\u201cHad it not been for the fact that Young Master Yao didn\u2019t join the ranks of officials in the imperial court, I\u2019m afraid Xue Xiuzhuo would not even have the chance to shine today.\u201dStill looking displeased, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThe turbulence of politics cannot be equated with the engagement of academia. Yao Wenyu may not necessarily do better than Xue Xiuzhuo. These two are interesting; they are opposites in every way.\u201d\u201cWhen all is said and done, he\u2019s Secretariat Elder Hai\u2019s student. If Xue Xiuzhuo is a traveler of the secular world, then Young Master Yao is an immortal who transcends the mundane world.\u201d Chen Yang pondered it over. \u201cBut looking at Secretariat Elder Hai, he cherishes Young Master Yao more.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Hai Liangyi imparts his knowledge to Yao Wenyu without reservation. He did not hesitate to break his original beliefs and overlook the noble clans\u2019 prejudice to accept him as his student. This alone is enough to see how much he values him. Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s political achievements all these years are decent, yet Hai Liangyi still would not give him the dignity of being real teacher and pupil. What\u2019s more, Hai Liangyi does not have the slightest intent all these years to force Yao Wenyu to serve as an official. Yuanzhuo, Yuanzhuo. It was out of fatherly love that Hai Liangyi bestowed this courtesy name on Yao Wenyu back then. The closeness of a teacher and pupil whose relationship has already reached that extent is already something no one else can compete with.\u201d Xiao Chiye said, \u201cYao Wenyu is a legitimate noble young master of a noble clan. Going by their way of thinking, Yao Wenyu is even more legitimate than those so-called \u2018legitimate di descendants\u2019 of the Pan, Fei, and Xue Clans. The Yao Clan is honorable and distinguished. Even the ladies of the Hua Clan would find it hard to marry into the Yao Clan in the past. Mountains of gold and silvers are, to him, not that much of a rarity as a bowl of wild herbs.\u201dChen Yang had not seen Yao Wenyu that many times. When he bought the residence, he only had a brief encounter with him once. He remembered the latter as a scholar with a\u00a0zhaowen\u00a0bag5\u00a0on him, one who did not like to ride horses or sit in sedans, and instead kept a donkey.\u201cIs Ding Tao back?\u201d Xiao Chiye suddenly asked.Chen Yang said, \u201c\u2026 He hasn\u2019t left yet.\u201d\u201cLet him play.\u201d Xiao Chiye strode into his own house and removed the brocade robe on him to replace with a set of ordinary clothes. \u201cAt this point in the banquet, I should have already drunk with all those whom I ought to keep company. There\u2019s still some spare time before daybreak. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan stepped out of the alleyway, and Xi Dan followed after him from behind. Xi Dan did not dare to overtake Shen Zechuan and simply stood behind him as he waited for orders with his head lowered.Unexpectedly enough, Shen Zechuan was gentle. After turning around to look at him for some time, he said, \u201cYou spoke well tonight.\u201dXi Dan quickly bowed and replied, \u201cIt is this lowly one\u2019s greatest aspiration to help Your Excellency with your frustrations and difficulties.\u201d\u201cBut Xi Hongxuan is suspicious by nature; it\u2019s not possible to trick him out of real money with only a few words.\u201d Shen Zechuan commented. \u201cAre you fully aware of his businesses across the various lands?\u201dXi Dan said, \u201cYes, yes, I am! His accounts, whether big or small, would always be sent to his residence in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0every month. The sixty-eight shopkeepers under him are all sons of domestic slaves; the parents, wives, and children of these people are all in his grasp. They were raised specifically for the purpose of managing his accounts. There is no way to hide any big or small goings-on in the storefronts from his eyes; he knows the score. And that\u2019s why there has never been a problem in his business empire all these years.\u201dShen Zechuan then replied, \u201cIf Xi Hongxuan wants to withdraw these four million, he has to brief you to take the money from the money vault and hand you the key to open the vault door. I only want to ask: how will this money be transferred?\u201dXi Dan silently made some mental notes and said after a while, \u201cThere is, in fact, a huge risk when traveling on land. When escorting the money carts, cargos are needed as a front to conceal the silvers. This is four million we are talking about. Without a business with a long history to serve as the cover, then Jiang Qingshan, the Provincial Administration Commissioner of Juexi, would be able to see through it right away. Moreover, Your Excellency, if we travel by land, then we must first bypass the thirteen cities of Juexi, as well as Dicheng. These are all difficult checkpoints to pass. Most importantly, Xi Hongxuan is right; there is no place to conceal this sum of money in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0at all.\u201dThese were silver ingots and not paper bills. Even if one had vacant a quarter to keep them hidden, there was no knowing whether it would be able to accommodate all four millions of them. Then, there was also the headache of spending this money once he had the money in hand.Shen Zechuan pondered as he looked into the night, then said, \u201cThis sum will not enter\u00a0Qudu.\u201dXi Dan did not dare to make a sound.Sure enough, Shen Zechuan continued after some time, \u201cThe shipment is subjected to inspections by Juexi whether it is transported by land or by sea. Four million is too great of a sum. Even if we are thorough in our planning to keep a tight lid on this matter and hide the shipment from the prying eyes, those who carry out the orders won\u2019t necessarily do a good job of the same. It\u2019s also pointless if the money can\u2019t be spent when it comes in. And so, this money won\u2019t reach\u00a0Qudu.\u201dTrying to figure out what Shen Zechuan was thinking, Xi Dan tentatively probed, \u201cWhat Your Excellency means\u2026 is to trick the money out of him, keep it there, and circulate it through trading?\u201d\u201cOne half of it will be handed to you to do just that,\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cI\u2019ll come up with something for the other half. Be prepared. The Xi Clan\u2019s business is extensive, and they can\u2019t do without a manager. When Xi Hongxuan falls, you\u2019ll be the next in the line.\u201dXi Dan quickly answered in agreement.Without another word more, Shen Zechuan climbed into the horse carriage and parted with Xi Dan for the time being. He still had to return to the\u00a0imperial prison\u00a0to review the files of all cold cases within the last two decades to infer some clues from them. He did not even have the time to go home and sleep.The horse carriage reached the\u00a0Imperial Prison. Ge Qingqing, who was on night patrol, had long since opened the gates to wait for Qiao Tianya to drive in.When Shen Zechuan stepped off the carriage, Ge Qingqing came closer and whispered, \u201cHis Lordship the Marquis is here.\u201dShen Zechuan unclasped his outer cloak and stepped onto the front porch. He nodded towards Ge Qingqing, who then took his leave. Shen Zechuan pulled off his cloak and hanged it on his arm as he pushed open the door.Xiao Chiye, having drunk wine, could not rid himself of the scent of wine even after he had a change of clothes. He slumped on Shen Zechuan\u2019s chair, with an opened book covering his face. When he heard the sound, he lifted the book but did not move.\u201cCome sit here.\u201d Xiao Chiye tossed the book onto the table.Shen Zechuan shut the door. He hung his outer cloak on the clothes rack and undid the clasps on his clothes in passing. Meeting Xiao Chiye\u2019s gaze, he swung one of his legs over Xiao Chiye\u2019s thighs, coming face-to-face with him before suddenly drawing even closer to him. Xiao Chiye reached out to wrap his arms around Shen Zechuan\u2019s lower back, and their delicate lips met as they first kissed to their hearts\u2019 content.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 : Betrothal GiftThis bout of sparring lasted a long time, pushing their satiety level to an even greater height until it became an insatiable desire for more after they had taken their first taste of the forbidden fruit. They were used to testing each other\u2019s limit in the dark. As their love grew increasingly deeper, a mere kiss was no longer able to fill their hunger. Desire, in its prime, laid bare at its rawest. Such a cloyingly sweet and clingy intimacy was a unique treat distinct to lovers, simply because it was a luxury to be in each other\u2019s company at all times. Since there were many eyes and ears inside the\u00a0Imperial Prison, a kiss could only be considered a kind of tacit compensation between them.When it was time to end the kiss, Xiao Chiye asked, \u201cWhere did you go?\u201dAs Shen Zechuan eased into his seated position, his thighs ground against the sides of Xiao Chiye\u2019s legs. He took his time slowing down his breathing. With a hint of veiled seduction in his half-lidded eyes, he replied, \u201cCounting money.\u201dXiao Chiye squeezed him and said, \u201cDid you get off on counting money?\u201dShen Zechuan let out a husky laugh. \u201cGetting off from being squeezed by you.\u201dAt Shen Zechuan\u2019s laugh, Xiao Chiye felt restless. He grabbed Shen Zechuan\u2019s chin to hold it in place and said, \u201cKeep going with this seduction of yours.\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s collarbone was peeking out from his undone collars, and the brutal bite marks from the last time had yet to fade. Paying them no mind, Shen Zechuan wetted his bitten lips and said, \u201cI have to discuss something with you.\u201dXiao Chiye held him up and said, \u201cWhat a coincidence. I have something to discuss with you too.\u201dShen Zechuan was so scalded by Xiao Chiye\u2019s gaze that his mouth felt dry and parched. He said, \u201cThe military supplies this year have to wait until April before they can be dispatched from Juexi. I need to borrow and use the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path.\u201dXiao Chiye only had to think for a little to know what he was up to. \u201cThe military supplies passing through the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path are personally escorted by the Libei Armored Cavalry themselves. There are no inspection checkpoints along the way. You can use it to transport the silvers, but it\u2019s all subjected to my elder brother\u2019s approval.\u201d\u201cIf this money belongs to me, the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0naturally won\u2019t agree to it. But if this sum of money is yours, the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0will surely agree.\u201d Shen Zechuan raised his chin slightly. \u201cHere is my betrothal gift. Keep it for me, Second Young Master.\u201d\u201cOnly this much as a betrothal gift?\u201d Xiao Chiye laughed as he freed up one hand to place the meal box on the table. \u201cA tough deal.\u201dShen Zechuan sniffed and said, \u201cThere\u2019s grilled fish.\u201dWith that, he promptly forgot about the betrothal gift and pulled out chopsticks inside the box. It was in this way that Xiao Chiye watched as he ate. In a blink of an eye, the bowl of rice was half gone, and there were only bones left of the fish when it returned to the plate.Xiao Chiye actually did not like eating fish. He had lost his mother when he was young, and his household was not one to spoil its children, unlike how the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0pampered their offspring. Although he had a nanny and maidservants to wait upon him, he had to feed himself once he had learned how to hold the chopsticks. He was headstrong, and there were plenty of toys he loved to play with, so he did not care to waste his time picking out the fish bones. After getting choked on it enough times, he hardly ate it anymore.Xiao Chiye looked at him and said, \u201cDoes it smell good? Apparently, it\u2019s from a chef from Hezhou, who is even harder to hire than the imperial chefs from the palace.\u201d Shen Zechuan picked out the fish bones and fed Xiao Chiye the meat with his chopsticks. Xiao Chiye tasted it and commented, \u201cPassable.\u201dHaving eaten his fill, Shen Zechuan set down his bowl and chopsticks and said, \u201cWhat do you want to discuss with me?\u201dXiao Chiye handed him a handkerchief and said, \u201cThe earlier investigation into Xiangyun missed one piece of information. A few years earlier, Xue Xiuzhuo bought a batch of people from Xiangyun Villa and kept them in his residence. I\u2019m afraid even Xi Hongxuan doesn\u2019t know about this matter.\u201dAs expected, there was a shift in Shen Zechuan\u2019s expression. He said, \u201cHe\u2019s not one to keep and raise prostitutes in private. This kind of thing is also almost unheard of in Ouhua Pavilion. This action is too abnormal.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s abnormal.\u201d Xiao Chiye leaned back against the back of the chair. \u201cI have a hunch that the reason Xiangyun made a false charge against me lies here.\u201d\u201cHe bought them a few years back.\u201d Shen Zechuan gradually furrowed his brows. \u201cIf it was truly to get Xiangyun under his control, then this move was planned much too early.\u201d\u201cWhy would Xiangyun fall under his control because of this? Some pawns, if planted too early, would not necessarily be able to stand up to the test of time. I feel that he\u2019s not making such a move just to get a handle against Xiangyun.\u201d Xiao Chiye sorted out his line of thought. \u201cYour plotting of the assassination is not something he would be able to predict in advance. So the subsequent post-developments would definitely be hard for him to guard against.\u201dXiao Chiye groped around these messy threads of clues, one at a time. His wolf-like intuition told him that this matter would not be that simple.\u201cImprovision.\u201d Shen Zechuan suddenly righted Xiao Chiye\u2019s face and said, \u201cYou are right. The puppet string connected to Xiangyun was not specifically intended to be used for dealing with you\u2026 Xiangyun\u2019s act of perjury was simply an opportunity he seized for his own purpose. The fact that he could simply throw out Xiangyun to use shows that Xiangyun is of little significance to him. There is another reason he bought those people, and Xiangyun is merely a convenient pawn that incidentally came with this reason. What\u2019s more, she\u2019s a pawn he can\u2019t wait to discard.\u201d\u201cThen, the key to his purchase of those people is\u2026\u201d Xiao Chiye was on the same wavelength.\u201c\u2026 among the batch of people he bought.\u201d Shen Zechuan completed his sentence softly.Both men looked at each other, caught yet again in another puzzle of unknowns. Xiangyun Villa was a brothel. What person could there be in a brothel who would be of great importance to Xue Xiuzhuo?\u201cHe bought over ten people to obscure the truth and throw everyone off scent so that no one can tell who exactly was his intended purchase. No doubt Xiangyun herself doesn\u2019t know the answer either.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cI have to get Xue Xiuyi to probe into this matter again. His status in the Xue Residence would allow him free access to the residence. Xue Xiuzhou might be able to obstruct and deny entry to outsiders, but he definitely can\u2019t do that to Xue Xiuyi.\u201dThis piece of information was indeed important, but Shen Zechuan could not figure it out at present. He had maneuvered Xi Hongxuan into action this time also because he had apprehensions about Xue Xiuzhuo, who similarly had Xi Hongxuan in his grasp. Instead of becoming more distinct and decipherable with the passage of time, this person had, on the contrary, became increasingly obscure and unreadable.\u201c\u2026 There\u2019s still time.\u201d Shen Zechuan seemed to be thinking aloud to himself. \u201cWe will be thrown off kilter the moment we get overly anxious, and that could easily put us in a disadvantageous position. Since he has not made his move, then it means it\u2019s not time yet, and this is an opportunity we can exploit. At this time, we are the ones hiding in the dark, while he\u2019s out there in the open. We will definitely learn some crucial information if we follow the clues\u2026 Xi Hongxuan has always been on friendly terms with Xue Xiuzhuo all these years. Even if he\u2019s unaware of Xiu Xiuzhuo\u2019s purchases of those prostitutes, there will still be something he knows that others don\u2019t. I\u2019ll probe him again later.\u201d\u201cAfter saying so much, you still haven\u2019t let this Second Young Master in on the details,\u201d Xiao Chiye did not let him get off him. \u201cHow much silver did you swindle from him?\u201dShen Zechuan snapped out of his thoughts and pursed his lips slightly. He raised four fingers, just like he had done so before.Xiao Chiye immediately grasped those fingertips tight without demur. \u201cSweet. Worth it. Put it down as your betrothal gift, quick.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cYou should act with a little more reserve instead of jumping at it. Four million is too little still.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cIt\u2019s too generous. A starting price at four million? For someone who can make this much money as you do, this Second Young Master will take whatever price you offer.\u201dAmused by him, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cI told him that Wei Huaigu wanted four million silvers. There was not the slightest bit of hesitation or reluctance on his part at all, which shows that four million is simply a drop in the ocean to the Xi Clan.\u201dSeeing how happy he was tonight, Xiao Chiye made no further mention of Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s matter. He jerked his legs to jolt him and said, \u201cOnly the Xi Clan themselves know precisely how much money the Xi Clan has. All the others can only see are the salterns and copper mines they operate. The extent of their enterprise isn\u2019t just limited to the whole empire, but also stretches as far as the foreign lands. The common rich young masters play by hitting the brothels and the gambling dens, but Xi Hongxuan\u2019s idea of fun is to run brothels and gambling dens. That broker house on Donglong Street is also his shop, and its internal dealings implicate plenty of imperial court bigwigs, all of whom have fields and businesses at stake in his hands, so they have no choice but to give him face. This time, it\u2019s four million, but how much will it be the next time? The Northeast Provisions Bridle Path is only opened twice every year. How to hide and spend that much silver are all issues you have to think through very carefully.\u201d\u201cNo one has ever broken through the Xi Clan\u2019s money vault, so putting the money inside is the most secure. No matter how that money is spent now, it\u2019d be hard to escape the eyes of the imperial court. The accounts of your 20,000-strong\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0already have to be checked and triple-checked in successive order. If this sum of money is not spent and disposed of perfectly, then the Second Young Master would have to be detained in jail to await trial.\u201dHis curiosity piqued, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cSpending money, huh? What else is there other than frittering it away by playing and having fun\u2026 Or are you preparing to save it for Zhongbo?\u201d\u201cNowhere in mind for the money to go to for the time being.\u201d Seeing that it was almost time, Shen Zechuan fastened his cloak with one hand. \u201cThe Second Young Master doesn\u2019t handle household affairs, so how would you know how valuable the daily staples like tea, rice, oil, and salt are? There will be plenty of uses for the money in the future, so there\u2019s no harm in keeping it on hand, even if we can\u2019t spend it all for the time being. It\u2019s better to be prepared for all contingencies.\u201dBoth of them were clearly set on defrauding Xi Hongxuan by convening in this way to discuss the latter\u2019s household finances and assets with such serious expressions. Xiao Chiye still had to return to Kailing River, and after saying a few words, he had to leave. He had rushed over as soon as he had the free time to see Shen Zechuan, and now, having fed the latter, he could not afford to sit and linger any longer.As Xiao Chiye turned over to mount his horse, he recalled something else and pulled the reins to say, \u201cThe inspection will happen these two days. The Grand Secretariat has already proposed a candidate for the Provincial Administration Commissioner for the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo. That Jiang Qingshan of Juexi had hurried over to report to\u00a0Qudu\u00a0on imperial orders. My guess is that it\u2019s likely him.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve long heard of his name and reputation. I remembered how he displayed courage and foresight when he handled the aid relief efforts for the thirteen cities of Juexi six years ago.\u201d At this point, Shen Zechuan recalled that this person was also on good terms with Xue Xiuzhuo and could not help but hesitate.\u201cAlthough his personal friendship with Xue Xiuzhuo is pretty good, it does not necessarily mean that he\u2019s in Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s camp. When he enters the capital, you can meet him to try to get a grasp on him. He isn\u2019t a descendant of a noble clan, and he doesn\u2019t rely on the noble clans for backing. You can decide for yourself whether or not we can use him when the time comes.\u201d Seeing Shen Zechuan standing on the steps, Xiao Chiye raised a hand to beckon to him.Shen Zechuan was all ears to hear him out. He did not expect Xiao Chiye to simply say nothing and merely caressed a handful of his hair with his palm. With a lift of its hooves,\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0broke into a gallop. Ge Qingqing pushed the gates open, and Xiao Chiye rode away into the night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 : ShadowsThe food in the prison was unclean, and so Xi Hongxuan suffered a stomach upset. His constitution was already weakened during the epidemic, and now he was in even more of a misery. He was not in a good state mentally, so he often fell into a lethargic sleep. Furthermore, it was dark all around each time he woke up, and gradually, he lost track of time.Without any window to ventilate the room, this narrow and cramped room smelled foul and stale, with a damp, musty smell thrown in for effect. There was no way an ordinary man would be able to endure it.Xi Hongxuan was badly ill, yet he was unable to turn and move his body as freely as he would have wanted. All he could do was to lay paralyze on the straw mat and let his consciousness drift along with the dampness and cold.As usual, the warden moved the flap open and stuffed the rice inside, but he did not hear any movements from Xi Hongxuan today. He looked in through the hole, but all he could see was Xi Hongxuan\u2019s drooping arm. The warden was afraid that Xi Hongxuan had died, thus he opened the door and took the lamp to shake it in front of Xi Hongxuan\u2019s face.Xi Hongxuan struggled to open his eyes. With dry lips and a parched mouth, he said, \u201cS\u2026 sir, please spare me some water.\u201dThe warden flipped his hand over and poured a bowl of water onto Xi Hongxuan\u2019s face.Xi Hongxuan exerted himself to open his mouth to receive the water, hardly bothering with his dampened collars. He drank the water and pulled himself together to say, \u201cThank you, thank you!\u201dThe warden threw the bowl away, then grabbed the oil lamp and made to leave.With an unexpected burst of strength, Xi Hongxuan suddenly grabbed hold of the warden\u2019s clothes. He forced out a smile on his chubby face and said, \u201cBuddy, tell me. This *cough*! This place is not the prison at all, am I right?\u201dThe warden swatted off Xi Hongxuan\u2019s hand. But Xi Hongxuan burst out laughing in a hoarse voice instead, gasping violently as he lay on the straw mat. He pulled at the front of his soaked clothes and moved his eye to stare at the pitch-dark roof. He said, \u201cThis place isn\u2019t the prison\u2026 I\u2026 I should have thought of it a long time ago! It has already been a few days. Even if Kong Qiu doesn\u2019t interrogate me, there should be officials from the Ministry of Justice coming over to make their rounds for a check\u2026 Too quiet\u2026 It\u2019s too quiet here\u2026\u201dXi Hongxuan said, then swiftly fixed his eyes on the warden in a stare.\u201cI\u2019ve done some calculations. You come to deliver food every day at precisely the same time, and you even push and put the tray into exactly the same position. Buddy, the average warden isn\u2019t this rigid! It has already been a few days, and nobody came to exchange shifts with you in guarding the prison door\u2026 You wouldn\u2019t even accept my money, and even these sleeves of yours are so clean and tidy without so much a speck of grease and dust! You are well-built and tall, discreet and reticent\u2014You are an Imperial Bodyguard, right?!\u201dThe warden\u2019s face was expressionless as he carried the oil lamp and walked away to close the door. Xi Hongxuan listened to the sound of metal chains winding around it, then pounded his fists hard on the straw mat under him.\u201cShen Zechuan\u2026 Shen Zechuan!\u201d Xi Hongxuan pounded until his knuckles reddened. He abruptly let loose a shout at the top of his voice, \u201cPlotting against me\u2026 To think you\u2019d scheme against me! You. Tell him. Tell him to come!\u201dThere was no response from the darkness.Xi Hongxuan dug his fingers into the straw mat. His consciousness was in a muddle as he spat hatefully, \u201cHe wants money, doesn\u2019t he? Call him over. As long as he let me out\u2026 as long as he let me out\u2026\u201d He forcefully swallowed his saliva, then suddenly pulled at his hair and gasped, \u201cI\u2019ll give him money! I can\u2019t fucking stand this anymore!\u201dThe warden sat down outside with the oil lamp next to him and popped the broad beans into his mouth to down with his wine. With the metal door behind him blocking off Xi Hongxuan, all that could be heard from within was the sound of faint sobs and whimpers, much like the wind in the dead of the night.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xi Hongxuan\u2019s eyes had turned cloudy. He did not dare to sleep again out of fear that he would not wake up if he fell asleep. By the time Shen Zechuan came again, he had already calmed down.Shen Zechuan remained on his feet as he sized up Xi Hongxuan.Xi Hongxuan once had a narrow escape from the jaws of death when he headed out to sea. Ever since he fought his way back from certain death, he had never cut such a sorry sight. He was different from the other descendants of the noble clans. He was not afraid of being caught in desperate situations, nor was he afraid of looking wretched. He let Shen Zechuan look as he strained his dry and hoarse throat to let out an unwarranted laugh for a moment before he said, \u201cLanzhou, you have guts! Four million\u2026 I nearly met my end being fleeced by you.\u201d\u201cThis hadn\u2019t been an easy place to find. It mustn\u2019t be too conspicuous, and it can\u2019t be too far away.\u201d Shen Zechuan let out a soft sigh. \u201cI sure wasn\u2019t expecting you to be this meticulous and discerning in your observations.\u201dXi Hongxuan shook his arm and said, \u201cMen die for money, while birds die for food. Brother, I\u2019m more than willing to give you this sum of money! But you can\u2019t simply want my life for just this bit of money\u2026\u201d His tone was a little weak and unsteady, but hunger and illness were not able to deprive him of the ability to adapt to his circumstances. He continued, \u201cLanzhou\u2026 I could have still pretended to be in the dark. I\u2019m the only one who knows where the Xi Clan\u2019s keys are. I could have run around in circles with you and extracted myself out of here through trickery. But see, I didn\u2019t do so. I still hold this bit of brotherhood to heart\u2026 Lanzhou! We joined forces to kill Xi Gu\u2019an and Ji Lei. You are now the target of envy in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. If you screw me to death now, you will lose the Xi Clan\u2019s support! The more you climb your way up in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, the narrower the path you have to navigate. You already know what it feels like to be stuck in a situation so difficult that you can hardly move a step forward, don\u2019t you? Which of those old men with hereditary positions in noble clans will be willing to submit to you? You are an ambitious one. Isn\u2019t it also on my account that Han Cheng could tolerate you? If you kill me, you will become the target of all!\u201dShen Zechuan squatted down, holding a handkerchief between his fingers as he looked at Xi Hongxuan and sought his advice with a serious expression. \u201cThen, in your opinion, what should I do?\u201dXi Hongxuan had seen this expression of Shen Zechuan countless times; he knew that there was no doubt Shen Zechuan\u2019s intent to kill had been ignited. So he dripped with cold sweat as he traded gazes with Shen Zechuan for a moment before he replied, \u201cWe haven\u2019t reached the point where we fall out with one another. Shen Zechuan, I lost this time; I concede! It\u2019s not a disgrace at all to suffer a business defeat. There\u2019s no need for me to create a scene and fall out with you over this bit of trivial matter. I fear you! This is the truth. But it\u2019s also precisely because of this fear that I want to continue to work with you. Think about it. If you kill me, you will only have four million. But if you have me in your grasp, then you\u2019ll have the Xi Clan\u2019s mountains of gold and silver. I concede defeat! So why get your hands stained with this bit of blood? We still have all the days ahead of us to lord it over\u00a0Qudu!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a fair point.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a tad too easy to dismiss me with just the words \u2018concede defeat\u2019, isn\u2019t it? I heard that the Second Young Master has sixty-eight keys. So how about we split them forty-sixty? It\u2019d also set my mind at ease.\u201dXi Hongxuan slowly propped himself up. The expression in his eyes as he looked at Shen Zechuan was ferocious as he said, \u201cI can give you the keys. But once you take the keys, you can\u2019t ask for Qi Huilian again. How about it? Are you willing?\u201dShen Zechuan slowly raised his fingers before putting it down again as if he was bored stiff. He said, \u201cYou think Qi Huilian is worth this sum? Naturally, I want the keys.\u201d\u201cSince he\u2019s worth nothing, then it\u2019s pointless to retain him. I\u2019m killing him then!\u201dShen Zechuan suddenly began to laugh. He said, \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know where he is? We are already at this point, and you still want to test me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s testing me!\u201d Xi Hongxuan crawled slowly towards Shen Zechuan, finally revealing a savage expression. \u201cI understand you. Lanzhou, the same trick is useless if you play it one time too many. You are accustomed to deceive others with words. The more you pretend not to give a hoot about someone at this moment, the more important they are to you. You tricked me once that day in the courtyard, and now you still want to use the same trick on me. I, Xi Hongxuan, may not be a person of outstanding smarts, but I\u2019m also not dumb to that extent. You don\u2019t know where he is. If you know, haha! Then you\u2019d have killed me after getting the money! So how did it go, Shen Zechuan? Am I correct in saying that you still couldn\u2019t find him despite searching all over\u00a0Qudu?\u201dShen Zechuan slightly tightened his grip on his handkerchief.Xi Hongxuan smoothed aside his messy hair and said, \u201cAs much as you may be eloquent, you\u2019ve forgotten one thing, and that is, your meticulous and careful concealment of him is already enough to make me suspicious. Even if I believe you a little, I still have to be on guard against you. The thing to fear when having dealings with you is that you\u2019d turn around and give me a stab.\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s eyes were emotionless as he looked at Xi Hongxuan and said, \u201cThen, what do you want?\u201d\u201cI want to get out of here.\u201d Xi Hongxuan pointed at the door. \u201cI want to walk out of here unscathed. If I can\u2019t get out tonight, then Qi Huilian\u2019s corpse will be left on your doorstep tomorrow morning. Do you believe me? You can try me. Xi Dan, that traitorous bastard who betrayed his master for wealth, must have told you that all the men under my command are children of the domestic slaves in our clan. My safety concerns the safety of hundreds of people. Even if I can\u2019t get out, I still have plenty of ways at my disposal to kill off Qi Huilian!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201dShen Zechuan suddenly got up, and that dreary, ruthless emotion within him burst forth in this filthy room. He took a few steps back, taking advantage of the dimness to blur that face of his into some kind of behemoth lurking in the dark.\u201cThis place is isolated from outsiders. How are you passing on the message to others? Tricking me even when death is near at hand, and you still tell me to try you?\u201d Shen Zechuan said with a shadow of a smile in a frosty tone, \u201cSure then. Let\u2019s us try. I\u2019ll send you on your way out.\u201d\u201cIf I could be on guard against you in advance, then why couldn\u2019t I take precautions against you prior?!\u201d Xi Hongxuan was drenched in cold sweat on seeing the situation deteriorate. He promptly raised his voice, \u201cI\u2019ve long told the guards on watch that I\u2019ll head down once every half a month. If I don\u2019t, then they will strike! You asked me the last time if I dare to believe your words. Shen Zechuan, this time I\u2019m asking you, do you dare to believe the same?!\u201dShen Zechuan did not make a sound.Xi Hongxuan then slowed his tone, as if soothing him. \u201cSince you can buy over Xi Dan, then you must have already known that I am the only one who knows where Qi Huilian is. I\u2019ve long understood that no one in this world can be trusted, so I have left countless escape routes in place for myself. Lanzhou, why must we both be on the losing end? It doesn\u2019t benefit either of us to infuriate each other. Aren\u2019t you making all these moves for the sake of gains? This deal is so unprofitable, no doubt you won\u2019t do it. Whatever it is that you\u2019re lacking, I have it all, and I\u2019ll give it to you. You only need to lend me this guts and wisdom of yours, and we can thrive and flourish in\u00a0Qudu. Look at that Li Jianheng. He\u2019s a good emperor, one that\u2019s few and far between. He signifies an even faster path to success for men like you and me. This is a meteoric rise we\u2019re talking about, Lanzhou! Do you think Xiao the Second would be able to accept you if you kill me and offend the noble clans? How long can the Xiao Clan\u2019s prestigious reputation of being infallible and undefeated in battles continue on for? Xiao Fangxu is already old. If Xiao Jiming were to die too, then what is Xiao the Second alone good for? They are doomed to fail and fall!\u201dXi Hongxuan seemed to lament, and at the same time, encourage.\u201cLanzhou, you and I both have had a hard time being under the control of others, and now you still want to choose to submit to Xiao the Second and be at his beck and call? The only things in this world that can never abandon you are power and money! Join forces with me, and I\u2019ll give you money. You just need to help me keep the Xi Clan\u2019s reputation intact, and we can bring our business deal up a level. When that time comes, it\u2019d be hard for anyone jockeying for power to sway you and me from our positions! You previously wanted me to swallow up the other clans and proclaim myself king. So why are you now bound by constraints and limits yourself?! Then, there\u2019s the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo. Don\u2019t you want to rebuild Zhongbo to avenge yourself for the humiliation you suffered in the past? Shen Wei\u2019s name can never be fully cleared, but you can use money to smash the gates to Zhongbo open. They are currently so poor that they even exchange children for food1\u00a0in their dire straits. You\u2019ll be like a deity who has descended from Heaven. By that time, who would still dare to refuse to yield to you? Who would still dare to curse you? These are all what money can give you. Can the Empress Dowager do the same? Can Xiao the Second do the same? Lanzhou, what are you still hesitating for? We can still continue to join forces and climb our way up to the top just like before.\u201dShen Zechuan was moved by his words. He no longer seemed to be brimming with murderous intent, and his tone had also softened some as he said, \u201cIf you had been this candid way earlier, we would not have to go as far as to face off each other in a confrontation, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re right. It\u2019s by joining forces that you and I can save ourselves a lot of troubles.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a merchant. To a businessman, profit comes first. If there isn\u2019t that much of a benefit to our collaboration, then why would I waste my breath like this?\u201d Xi Hongxuan\u2019s back itched. The part that had been wounded by the collapse the last time was scabbing over, and it itched so much these days that it hurt. He took a little breather, then continued, \u201cThen there\u2019s no time to lose. Let me out now. Once I\u2019m out, we can sit down for a proper discussion.\u201dXi Hongxuan had more than ten martial arts experts from the\u00a0martial fraternity\u00a0in the Xi residence in\u00a0Qudu. He had spent a large sum of money to hire them to intimidate Shen Zechuan the last time, and he had always kept them in his residence. In truth, he was already burning with anxiety, because he could not figure out what Shen Zechuan was thinking. As such, he had also started to harbor the intent to kill, determined as he was to burn his bridges and fight to the end. No matter what, he had to get out of here first\u2014it was only by getting out that there would be a variable he could exploit to turn things around!He wanted to kill Shen Zechuan so much that he could not even wait for tomorrow, much less engage in diplomacy with him. Being able to deal with each other for a long time often meant that both parties were evenly matched\u2014they had the room to be able to sit down and trade barbs. Xi Hongxuan felt that the present him and Shen Zechuan had already lost this balance. It was as if he had fallen into a certain kind of pouch that Shen Zechuan had bound to hold him in check as Shen Zechuan climbed his way up the official ranks, thereby rendering him incapable of controlling and swaying the development of the situation like he could at the outset.Xi Hongxuan still did not know where the problem lay, but based on his businessman\u2019s instinct, he had already discovered his current plight in which he was turning around in circles like a man under a spell2\u00a0had everything to do with Shen Zechuan.They had been working together in cahoots to this date, but other than killing Xi Gu\u2019an to get his hands on the Xi Clan\u2019s keys, the sweetness of every benefit Xi Hongxuan has had a taste of in all that had happened afterwards had been fleeting. Only Shen Zechuan had truly scaled to greater heights with power firmly in hand.Xi Hongxuan was sure that he had been made a fool of, but he still had a look of sincerity on his face. It was as if he admired Shen Zechuan to the point he worshipped the ground Shen Zechuan walked on, while at the same time, feared him to the point he dared not take any action.Qiao Tianya pushed the door crack open and cast the light from the oil lamp inside. Shen Zechuan\u2019s exposed wrists were clean. With his side bathed in the light from the lamp, he looked no different from the way he appeared in the daytime as he said politely, \u201cAfter you, please.\u201dXi Hongxuan inwardly breathed a sigh of relief.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 : Debt CollectionThe Xi residence was located in an inner street of\u00a0Qudu, slightly to the south. In comparison to the Pan\u2019s and Fei\u2019s residences, its total land area was significantly smaller. It was also near Prince Qin\u2019s Manor during the reign of Emperor Guangcheng. The Xi had special permission, but the first few clan heads had much foresight and did not dare build their mansion beyond what was permitted in the regulations. The interior architectural style of the residence was more the style of Juexi, while the building structures such as pavilions and terraces were all average and common.Xi Hongxuan was on tenterhooks the entire journey back, but once he heard the sounds of horse hooves come to a stop, he knew he was home. Not daring to be careless, he bunched up the hem of his robe, which had been soaked until it was wrinkled, and hurried off the carriage, where he saw Shen Zechuan standing before him sizing up the Xi\u2019s Residence.\u201cIt\u2019s an old mansion.\u201d Xi Hongxuan\u2019s tone was light and relaxed as he tried to keep up with his normal behavior. \u201cEven though we keep saying all these years that we want to renovate it, we never had the time. Come over in a few days when the weather gets warmer to take a look at the blueprint too.\u201dYet, Shen Zechuan turned his gaze towards the house next door. Those green glazed tiles at that end were obviously standard specifications1\u00a0of a prince\u2019s residence. But the lush trees covering the vermilion walls only made it look eerie.Xi Hongxuan followed his gaze over and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the Prince Qin\u2019s Manor. Prince Qin suffered from tuberculosis and passed away from his illness a year before the former emperor\u2019s ascension to the throne. This residence then fell into disuse. It\u2019ll probably be bestowed upon someone as a reward in the future.\u201d\u201cIt looks even more imposing than Prince Chu\u2019s Manor.\u201d Shen Zechuan did not shift his gaze away.\u201cOf course.\u201d Xi Hongxuan raised his thumb. \u201cThe current emperor was not a child favored by Emperor Guangcheng. At that time, the Crown Prince, Prince Qin, and the former emperor were the most outstanding ones among the imperial heirs. A pity the Crown Prince committed suicide at Zhao Zui Temple, Prince Qin passed away of illness in his residence, and the former emperor lingered on his deathbed\u2026\u201d He suddenly smiled. \u201cOtherwise, how could the current emperor have had the chance to sit on the throne? Prince Qin was also quite the pitiable one. He initially had a close father-and-son relationship with Emperor Guangcheng during Emperor Guangcheng\u2019s last few years, and Emperor Guangcheng often came here. But someone in the manor under him used his influence to commit violence and beat a few villagers to death. Consequently, a lawsuit was lodged against him, and Emperor Guangcheng punished him by putting him under house arrest in this residence. It was during that time Prince Qin contracted tuberculosis. Emperor Guangcheng even made a special trip down for a visit. No one knew what they talked about, but they eventually parted on bad terms, and from then on, Prince Qin fell out of favor. That punishment to self-reflect behind closed doors dragged on and on, keeping him locked up until his death.\u201dShen Zechuan tucked this piece of information away in his mind, but he had no wish to discuss it with Xi Hongxuan. When Xi Hongxuan saw that he had no interest in continuing the topic, he raised his hand to wave away the servants who were swarming over to them. He said, \u201cAlthough this residence of mine is not as big as the residences of princes and aristocrats, there\u2019s still some way to travel. Lanzhou, my body is extremely weak, and I stink to high heavens. It\u2019ll be faster if we take a ride in the small sedan.\u201d2The servants from the Xi\u2019s residence rushed to prepare the sedans. Xi Dan was originally the household steward, but he did not dare to show himself now, and it was instead Xi Hongxuan\u2019s eldest sister-in-law who came out to greet and welcome them.Xi Hongxuan loved this woman, or at least he said so himself. He had repeated countless times to Shen Zechuan that he wanted to kill Xi Gu\u2019an because of the hatred he bore Xi Gu\u2019an for seizing his wife away by force. But then, his expression was indifferent as he watched that woman descend the stairs. He did not ask for her to help support him either, and simply dismissed her in a perfunctory manner as he took his seat in the small sedan.Shen Zechuan lifted the curtain with a finger and saw it all clearly. Qiao Tianya, who was following outside the sedan, wanted to speak, but Shen Zechuan gave a slight shake of his head to stop him.The small sedans entered the Xi\u2019s residence and made several turns before arriving at the courtyard where Xi Hongxuan usually stayed. His courtyard was different from others. It was not overly decorated, and the long corridor was connected to an office with wide-opened doors and windows, as well as a row of brightly lit lanterns. The sound of abacus within, mingled with various local accents, proved to be particularly noisy. There was a tea table erected under a mat awning on the open ground before the front hall, and seated and standing underneath the awning were the various shopkeepers and bookkeepers who had come from all over Dazhou.At the sight of Xi Hongxuan, this motley crew of people all stood up and crowded around him. Those who were here to report expenses, prepare stocks, demand payments, and send greetings mobbed him all around, creating a din.Xi Hongxuan first bowed to the crowd in a greeting, then said, \u201cThis humble one has only just returned. Look, with how stinky I smell, I won\u2019t be able to do any work. There\u2019s no need for any of you to be anxious. Wait here with peace of mind and take turns to go into the office on that end one at a time. As for me, I had merely headed out these few days for some fun. It\u2019s nothing of importance. Our business will naturally continue as usual. Oh, as for the shopkeepers here to demand payment, there\u2019s no need for you to fret as well. When has the Xi Clan ever missed our deadlines and defaulted on our debts? As long as you have the memorandum with you, I will pay back all substantiated claims in full!\u201dXi Hongxuan hurriedly held Shen Zechuan firm as he pushed aside the crowd and called for the attendants to hurry over and serve tea and attend to them. He cupped his hands to those people the entire way before he managed to lead Shen Zechuan to a relatively quiet hall at the back.\u201cLanzhou, take a seat first. I\u2019ll go wash up a little and have a change of clothes before I return!\u201d Xi Hongxuan shook his dirty robe and instructed the servants to prepare the food and wine.Shen Zechuan took his seat and drank the tea. By the time the wine and food to go with wine were served, Xi Hongxuan had returned too. He was dressed in a brand new dark reddish-brown silk robe. He took his seat and personally poured wine for Shen Zechuan.\u201cSorry to have kept you waiting!\u201d Xi Hongxuan touched the flesh between his neck and let out a cheeky chuckle. \u201cHome is still where I feel comfortable. That cell is so awfully damp. I feel so refreshed all over now that I\u2019m done washing up. Here, Lanzhou, drink up! You really did not show mercy this time. A few more days locked up in there, and I\u2019ll be dead meat for sure!\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t go as far as that.\u201d Shen Zechuan said with a smile, \u201cThat was just to intimidate you. I won\u2019t deal you such a vicious blow for the sake of our friendship.\u201d\u201cYou really caused me so much grief!\u201d Xi Hongxuan groused with a bitter smile. \u201cThe state of my back looked to be in a frightfully bad state. I\u2019ll still have to call for a physician over to take a look at it later. Say, wouldn\u2019t it do for you to just tell me outright if you lack that four million? Aye, you just had to go around in such a big circle!\u201dBoth men chatted merrily over wine, showing no signs of the mutual hostility an hour earlier when they had been at daggers drawn with each other.The wine was excellent, as were the dishes. It was only when Xi Hongxuan was almost done eating that he wiped his mouth with a hand towel and spread his arms apart to sprawl back on the chair. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m unwilling to give you the keys you want. But Lanzhou, you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too. If I return Qi Huilian to you, then I\u2019d lost something to fall back on, so I can\u2019t hand the keys over to you on top of him.\u201dShen Zechuan, who did not eat much, set down his chopsticks and said, \u201cI\u2019ve done you a disservice in this matter too. But Second Young Master, there are some matters which I didn\u2019t make up myself. Go make some inquiries out there, and you\u2019ll know that Wei Huaigu truly doesn\u2019t harbor good intentions and has no wish to help you out of your predicament at all.\u201d\u201cI know they all have their own ulterior motives.\u201d Xi Hongxuan wiped away the fine beads of sweat. \u201cBut since you were able to get me out of prison to another place, it means that the imperial court didn\u2019t hand down that much of a punishment on me. This was His Majesty\u2019s idea, right?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty went to great effort to protect you, so the prison can\u2019t overstep their authority to investigate you. Now that you have been temporarily suspended from your post and have returned home, you won\u2019t be able to carry out your duties in the Bureau of Evaluations.\u201d Shen Zechuan changed the topic. \u201cI\u2019ve already sent you back home. The issue of the keys can be re-negotiated, but I want to see Qi Huilian now.\u201dXi Hongxuan threw aside the hand towel and smiled as he rubbed his stomach. He said, \u201cAs for the keys, we have to discuss and come to an understanding now. Lanzhou, you\u2019ve never conducted a business deal before, so you aren\u2019t aware of the ins and outs of it. It\u2019s not the slightest bit simpler than being an official. Holding those keys will allow you to transfer out the silvers, but those are deadweight silvers. If you take them out, you will sooner or later come to spend it all clean. So why not put it inside and let me continue to take care of the business? Isn\u2019t it wonderful to let your money beget more money for you? However much you need in the future, all you have to do is to just give me a number.\u201dHe sat tight in his chair. The earlier din had already disappeared without them realizing it. The windows and doors in his hall were all wide open, and the weeping willows outside shrouded in the color of ink looked like a row of hanged ghosts cramming at the windows looking in. The endless night was still and quiet, and the candle flame blazed a little. Those servants that had been waiting upon them all seemed to have vanished. It was as if both of them were the only ones left.Shen Zechuan slowly leaned back in his chair and said, \u201cHow the situation has changed. After stepping out of that prison cell, the Second Young Master has indeed toughened up.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m satiated after having had my fill of food and wine, and I\u2019m not hurting anymore.\u201d Xi Hongxuan looked at Shen Zechuan and pointed to his own head, \u201cAnd, I\u2019m still sober. I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s not a choice between Qi Huilian and the keys; your only option is to take Qi Huilian away. As long as you give the nod, I will give him to you immediately.\u201dShen Zechuan took his time. The little bamboo fan slid out from his sleeve pocket, and he grasped it for a moment to weigh it up. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what we discussed earlier.\u201dXi Hongxuan answered in a low, muffled voice, \u201cThe world of business is ever-changing at a rapid pace. Earlier, you held me by the balls, and now, I\u2019m the one who has you by the balls. The issues under discussion naturally have to change following this shift.\u201d\u201cWhat if I insist on both?\u201d Shen Zechuan smiled.\u201cThen it will all come to naught.\u201d Xi Hongxuan patted his belly. \u201cLet me offer you a piece of advice, Lanzhou. Don\u2019t be that greedy son of a bitch. As the saying goes, be content with your lot. You have already taken away four million. I won\u2019t pursue it further. This is already enough for a gesture of goodwill, right?\u201d\u201cBefore the money has been delivered into my hands, it does not count as having taken it.\u201d Shen Zechuan did not divulge to him the part where these four million taels would be split into two portions to be transported through the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path. Instead, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy journey to make either. You know it better than I do.\u201d\u201cI have the channels for escorting the goods. No matter how competent Jiang Qingshan is, he can\u2019t keep an eye down there all the time.\u201d Xi Hongxuan had already gained the upper hand. \u201cI can think of ways to get the money to you. I said it before, and I\u2019ll say it again. Lanzhou, I\u2019m willing to give you these four million. But you have to tell me the truth. Are the three incidents of collapse, flooding, and epidemic your doing?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cI\u2019ve long told you the honest truth. For this matter, you have to ask Xue Xiuzhuo. I can see you keeping a tight grip over these keys, so I won\u2019t insist on it. As you\u2019ve said, we cannot do without the other if we want to join forces. Now, can you give me Qi Huilian already?\u201dXi Hongxuan pushed his chair aside to get up and say, \u201cI\u2019ve long gotten someone to go get him. You have been waiting for so many days, there\u2019s no need to fret over waiting a little longer now.\u201dWith his rotund potbelly, he took some steps to aid digestion. Looking as if he was considering something. he eventually walked his way to the door and strode a step out, where he shouted, \u201cWhere\u2019s the man?\u201dThe servant outside whispered something in reply.Not hearing it clearly, Xi Hongxuan continued down the stairs. He took a few more steps once he had descended. The courtyard was dead silent. He suddenly jerked around and bellowed, \u201cShut the doors!\u201dAll at once, the wide-opened doors of the hall were shut tight, and the windows were secured with slabs of planks amid the sounds of \u201cthud\u201d. In the blink of an eye, the hall was completely sealed. Amidst the rustle of the night wind, which sent the grim willows swaying, several figures gradually materialized out of the night to lay siege to the hall.Xi Hongxuan gritted his teeth in hatred as he ripped off his mask and said, \u201cShen Zechuan! You still want back Qi Huilian? How insatiably greedy of you, just like a snake trying to swallow an elephant! For treating me like a fool to push around, I shall take your life tonight!\u201dHe retreated a few more steps back.\u201cDrag over that double-crossing Xi Dan, who bites the hand that feeds him!\u201dXi Dan had already been securely bound up by the others. On seeing him, Xi Hongxuan first gave him a kick to the face and sent him toppling over to the ground before he stomped violently on him.\u201cThe audacity of you to sell your master out for money! Despicable bastard, rotten piece of shit! You forgot that I have your parents in my hands. I shall have your whole family follow him to the grave tonight!\u201dHis eyes were already blazing with hatred as he spoke.\u201cDrag the Eldest Mistress up here too. Does she really think I don\u2019t know she\u2019s addicted to hooking up with this lowlife behind my back? Xi Dan, with that pea-sized gut of yours, you would never dare to betray me. But lust is like a blade hanging above your head.3\u00a0Who can you blame if you let someone get a handle against you and ended up involved in the whole sordid affair of betraying your master for money?! Scum!\u201dXi Dan was kicked until he rolled all over the ground and howled in pain, while that Eldest Mistress, whose legs had turned to jelly, was flung before Xi Hongxuan, where she wailed and pleaded ceaselessly.Xi Hongxuan let her hug his thigh as he looked at her and said grimly, \u201cDo you know he wanted to harm me? You know, and you still want to follow him. Were you already planning how to make your escape to somewhere far away with him? I\u2019ve never treated anyone better in this life than I treated you. I put in a hundred percent of my love and handed over eighty percent of my life. And this is how you treat me.\u201dWith a pair of red eyes, Xi Hongxuan hauled up the Eldest Mistress.\u201cXi Gu\u2019an snatched you away, and I snatched you back. I give you the same honor and prestige you have always enjoyed, and give you gold and jade so you never lacked for nothing. I hold you in both hands like my most precious treasure. You\u2026 oh, you!\u201d Xi Hongxuan was so consumed by hatred that his heart was dripping blood. \u201cLeave with him. I\u2019ll send you both on your way tonight!\u201dXi Hongxuan shoved her down coldly and spat, then said with a fiendish smile, \u201cDraw your blades! Mince up these heartless and ungrateful creatures, and we can save on the dishes to go with the wine tonight! This Second Master has the money!\u201dHe fished out large quantities of gold and silver ingots from his bosom and sleeves and dropped them to the ground, where they rolled with a clatter. Amid the sound of money colliding against each other, Xi Hongxuan staggered a few steps and burst out laughing with tears streaming down his face until his laughs gradually gave way to sobs.\u201cAll beings in this world are driven by benefits. I have money. So why bemoan the lack of someone true to me? For money, one can kill their closest kin, their flesh and blood, their beloved!\u201d Having thrown away all his gold and silver, Xi Hongxuan raised both of his arms high and shouted himself hoarse under the glint of cold steel, \u201cDo it! I\u2019m here to collect my debt!\u201dThe crowd promptly drew their blades, and\u00a0 snow-white light flashed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 : Scenery of SpringOvercast clouds shrouded the moon, giving rise to flickers of ghostly apparitions. The scraping sound of blades being unsheathed was just like the sound of silk being ripped apart in the wind, the tearing of which spelled the pressing sense of danger of an imminent peril. There were three taps of the bamboo fan in the hall. Shen Zechuan remained calm and composed as he held the pot to pour himself another cup of wine.\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Shen Zechuan picked up the wine cup. \u201cWe indeed have scores to settle tonight.\u201dXi Hongxuan lowered his arms and watched with cool detachment as the crowd swarmed towards the hall. He said, \u201cClever as you are, if you had been willing to comply obediently with the arrangements, you wouldn\u2019t have needed to suffer as much.\u201d\u201cThe moment you enter\u00a0Qudu, you\u2019re just like a caged bird in a pavilion, unmindful of the spreading blaze and danger ahead. You\u2019re really an unfortunate and a fortunate one. Back then, you fought the waves for a fighting chance at life, and for that, I toast you.\u201d As Shen Zechuan spoke, he slowly poured the wine over the ground.1\u00a0\u201cYou and I both understand the principle that those trapped in prior predicaments are also the ones most unlikely to be obedient\u2014because people who obey, nine out of ten, will not hold out until Heaven opens its eyes and lends them a hand.\u201d\u201cI fought against the battering of waves, and you are also fighting against the same. The lives of everyone in the world are worthless. Shen Zechuan, I toast you too! You survived in spite of all the torture and torment back then, but tonight, you are going to fail miserably, like a boat capsizing in a drain, haha!\u201d Xi Hongxuan laughed derisively, then abruptly turned indifferent, \u201cBetween you and me, only one may live.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve taken your bath and drank your wine.\u201d Shen Zechuan tossed away the wine cup gently and rose to face the doors. He lifted his hand and grasped the hilt of\u00a0Yang Shan Xue, his thumb pressing down against that white pearl as he laughed softly, \u201cDo you really not intend to tell me Qi Huilian\u2019s whereabouts before you go on your way?\u201dThe flame in the courtyard abruptly intensified. Xi Hongxuan turned his head for a look; the residence was already up in flames. He bellowed, \u201cDon\u2019t bother contending with him! Whoever can take down his head, I\u2019ll reward said person with two hundred taels of gold and silver!\u201dThe doors and windows instantly broke apart as numerous shadows pounced like wolves. Shen Zechuan\u2019s blade had already left its sheath. He took two steps forward, and blood went splattering along with the movement of his blade. The long blade that was\u00a0Yang Shan Xue\u00a0seemed to be forged from ice and cast of snow as its blade slit open men\u2019s throats. It was so fast that there was not a stain of blood on the edge of the blade even as the blood droplets spattered over the windows\u2019 paper.Yang Shan Xue\u00a0was the same as\u00a0Langli Blade. They lay low in this\u00a0Qudu\u00a0collecting dust, restrained by their sheaths to become the waist ornaments of refined young masters. But give them the chance to be drawn out of their sheaths, and one would be able to catch a glimpse of the bloodthirsty savagery of the blades and their masters from those cold glints.The tongue of flames came licking in a fury, and in a blink of an eye, half of the Xi\u2019s Residence was engulfed in a sea of fire. Qiao Tianya leaped up the rooftop and dashed along the ridge to kick over the incoming killers with swift flying kicks before he hooked himself upside down and flipped atop the central hall. He stood on the roof and flashed Shen Zechuan\u2019s gold lacquered waist token.\u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0are investigating a case on imperial orders. The Xi Clan assembled more than a hundred gallant men from the\u00a0martial fraternity\u00a0for a private gathering right under the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u2019s nose. Our investigations have unearthed the presence of criminal fugitives and outlaws still at large among them. Xi Hongxuan\u2019s intention is no small matter. For this, he ought to be executed!\u201d Qiao Tianya said in a clear and loud voice. \u201cThis case pertains to the incident in which the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u00a0was placed in harm\u2019s way. Anyone caught involved will be taken into custody at the\u00a0imperial prison. The Red Cavalry2\u00a0has already surrounded Xi\u2019s Residence. You people\u2019d best surrender without a fight!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t listen to his nonsense!\u201d Xi Hongxuan shouted. \u201cI\u2019m the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u2019s friend, one who has been through life and death with him. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0harbor the intent to murder loyal ministers to cover up their crimes. Those who aid me tonight are all upright heroes! You will all follow me to the palace gates tomorrow morning to receive your rewards!\u201dThat burning loft collapsed with a thunderous crash. Xi Hongxuan did not retreat a single step amid the waves of heat as he stared closely at the figure in the hall.\u201cThat eunuch faction has only just been eradicated. His Majesty advocates freedom of speech, and what he hates the most are treacherous officials like Shen Zechuan who want to abuse his power to deceive the masses and lord it over all! Gentlemen, the one who kills him will be a famous hero with his meritorious deeds recorded in history for ages to come!\u201dQiao Tianya secretly spat. This Fatty Xi\u2019s eloquence was truly outstanding. If they could not gag that mouth of his, then he could even make black out to be white! Qiao Tianya promptly kept away the token and leaped down, where he drew his blade to face the enemies head-on.The sheen of blood stood out against the blaze in the courtyard. Up ahead, the scene was already in chaos, with shouts and cries everywhere as shopkeepers, bookkeepers, and servants ran haphazardly all around. The formation of Red Cavalry outside moved swiftly, having already blocked off all the gates.A strapping figure suddenly stood out from the hall. Xi Hongxuan looked on indifferently. That body leaned back, as straight as a ramrod, and toppled over onto the stairs, the blood on its neck gushing forth incessantly. Shen Zechuan withdrew his blade and returned it to his sheath, then strode over the corpse\u2019s arm and walked down one step at a time.Xi Hongxuan suddenly burst out laughing. He laughed until he shook all over. He said, \u201cI still can\u2019t compare to you. By using this reason to kill me, even His Majesty won\u2019t dare to blame or censure you.\u201dShen Zechuan inclined his head to survey that raging fire and said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t originally meant to die this early.\u201dXi Hongxuan looked up at the sky and let out a long sigh. He was extraordinarily calm; those merry laughters and furious curses had all become a thing of the past. He said, \u201cWhether I die early or later, I\u2019m still being played for the fool in your hands. It\u2019s too fucking much of an aggrievement! But it\u2019s of no loss to me to lose to you. Shen Zechuan, I concede defeat. At the same time, I can\u2019t take it lying down. A hundred forges to temper steel3\u2014do you think you have already reached that stage? The reason I meet my end tonight is because I underestimated my enemy. However, there are plenty of people in this world who see you as the thorn in their side. They are all lined up in a queue waiting for you. You may kill one, then another one, but you will never be able to kill them all. How lamentable\u2026\u201dHe gazed silently at the night sky.\u201cYou and I were not born to be favoured. Things that are readily available to the others are yet things you and I have to fight for with our lives. The prejudice between children born of the principal wives and concubines is deeply rooted.4\u00a0How absurd is it for me to be clearly born of the principal wife, yet live a life worse than the sons from the other clans born of concubines? My life is worthless, and yours, even more so. You want to charge ahead, to fight, to seize. But who exactly will succeed or fail in the days to come?\u201d Xi Hongxuan spread his arms open, as if he was asking Heaven. At the same time, it was also as if he was asking Shen Zechuan, \u201cThere is no end to strife. Who exactly will fail or succeed in the days to come? Will you be able to secure your victory once I\u2019m gone? You kill the others, and the others kill you. Haha!\u201dThe sounds of Xi Hongxuan\u2019s laughter were wild and unbridled. He suddenly crouched down to pull out the blade from the corpse on the ground and stumbled his way closer towards Shen Zechuan.\u201cI\u2019m a man of the Xi Clan. In this life, I\u2019ve triumphed thrice over Xi Gu\u2019an; I\u2019m no less inferior to him! It\u2019s my parents who were blind! I placed my love in the wrong person, and exhausted all my love and hatred. I\u2014\u201d Xi Hongxuan brandished the blade to slit his own throat. Hot blood spurted over Shen Zechuan\u2019s body. The blade tumbled to the ground, and he pulled at Shen Zechuan\u2019s sleeve as he slid down to his knees along with the blade, slurring his words as he completed the last of his words with a forced smile, \u201c\u2026 shall wait, wait for you\u2026 on the path to the underworld\u2026\u201dShen Zechuan watched Xi Hongxuan fall at his feet. Warm blood trickled down his fingers. He stood in silence for a very long time against a backdrop of roaring fire, then lifted his hand to shake off the droplets of blood.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8The Xi residence was burned to ashes, and the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0brought the remaining survivors in the Xi\u2019s Residence into the\u00a0Imperial Prison. Shen Zechuan had Xi Hongxuan\u2019s deeds \u2013 in which he amassed hired hands and resisted arrest \u2013 all recorded in a memorial which he submitted to Li Jianheng to make his report when he met with the latter personally.Li Jianheng was greatly shocked, but there was irrefutable evidence of Xi Hongxuan gathering men in his estate, and the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0had thoroughly checked the backgrounds of these people through the Ministry of Justice. This matter was handled so impeccably with no loose ends that even the imperial censors could find no fault with it.Wei Huaigu was the most slick and sly. On seeing this, he promptly hinted to his pupils to first denounce Xi Hongxuan as a treacherous villain who had poisoned the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u2019s mind and led him astray, before decrying Xi Hongxuan for putting His Majesty in harm\u2019s way; the collapse of the Ouhua Pavilion was actually entirely staged by himself. The Wei Clan really went all out to absolve themselves of blame. Such was the state of affairs when the tea had cooled after the company had left.5Yet, even when Ge Qingqing brought men to search up and down the streets and alleys of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0and examine all entry and exit documents, they still never managed to find Qi Huilian and Ji Gang.\u201cThey are definitely still in\u00a0Qudu.\u201d Shen Zechuan closed the work documents on the desk. \u201cHe has the intention to use Teacher to threaten me. Sending them out of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0\u2013 if he did \u2013 would only make it harder for him to control and manipulate them.\u201d\u201cTeacher is a scholar, but\u00a0shifu\u00a0is a worthy opponent with few equals.\u201d Qiao Tianya said, \u201cI\u2019ve already sent men to secretly search for them these days. The search would surely throw up something.\u201dShen Zechuan said nothing.Seeing Shen Zechuan deep in his own thoughts, Qiao Tianya was about to take his leave when Shen Zechuan called out to him, \u201cSince there is no other business tonight, I\u2019ll make a trip to the Plum Blossom Residence. There are many matters to be discussed. You should leave first and wait for me there. Ask Gu Jin who are those in the batch of people Xiangyun Villa sold to Xue Xiuzhuo.\u201dQiao Tianya uttered an acknowledgment and took his leave. When he stepped out the door, he saw a few people resting in the courtyard. There were all seniors in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0of fourth grade and above. Among them, there were even a few whose ancestors had been bestowed with titles and properties, and who could don python robes6\u00a0and carry Xiuchun blades.7\u00a0Ge Qingqing had led his men to rest on the other side. Although everyone was an Imperial Bodyguard, Qiao Tianya could make out the subtle split into cliques among them.Shen Zechuan had advanced through the ranks too quickly within the last six months, which inevitably made others green with envy. Furthermore, with his close proximity to men in power on all sides, he had taken over the mantle of the Northern Judge,8\u00a0which could be considered to have established him as the top dog in the upper echelon of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0for real. The web of connections between the men was as convoluted as a labyrinth; everyone, even if picked at random, was of privileged background and title. When the new replaced the old, it was customary for them to swap pointers with one another. It was only because Shen Zechuan had been too busy with his official duties that he had yet to draw close to them. But once the busy spring farming season had passed, everyone was bound to see each other one way or another during their subsequent missions.Qiao Tianya\u2019s heart sank slightly. He let down the curtain and left ahead of Shen Zechuan.Xiao Chiye had yet to return from the military drill grounds at Mount Feng, and only Gu Jin was still at the Plum Blossom Residence. Qiao Tianya drank half a cup of wine with him and made some inquiries into the matter of Xiangyun Villa.\u201cA total of sixteen people of similar ages. All of them were young boys and girls below the age of twenty.\u201d Gu Jin and Qiao Tianya sat on the railing at the bottom of the veranda. The weather was fine today, with the sight of green buds and sprouts filling their visions. He said, \u201cAs for their specific backgrounds and origins, I have already told Tao-zi to write them out and hand them over to the young master. Your master will be able to see it a little later. However, this is not an easy matter to investigate. These people are a motley crew, like a jumbled cluster of grass. There are no other similarities between them other than their ages.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t this already illustrate the problem?\u201d Qiao Tianya picked up that little porcelain cup that was half the size of a typical cup and drank up the wine. He frowned as he savored the taste of it. \u201cThe harder this batch of people is to investigate, the more important they are. This wine is pretty good, but why use it with such a cup? It\u2019s not even the size of my finger.\u201d\u201cDrinking holds you up from your work. If you reek of wine when the masters return later, you\u2019re bound to get scolded.\u201d Gu Jin did not dare to drink as liberally as he always did these few days after having received a dressing down from Xiao Chiye the last time. He simply sat for a moment. The patrols in the Plum Blossom Residence were under his charge, so he left just a short while later and let Qiao Tianya have fun by himself.Qiao Tianya sat alone on the veranda and drank his wine as he appreciated the sight of spring. There was no one around, and he enjoyed himself nonetheless. He remembered that his zither was still here; thus he thought of taking it out to play. He rose to his feet and made a detour carrying the tray in hand, passing through branches that looked like green mist when he suddenly heard the zither. Qiao Tianya followed the sound in search of it. He did not charge out hastily, but instead brushed aside the green mist and took a peek out of the corner of his eyes.The long walkway was facing the natural sunlight, and sitting underneath was a brightly illuminated man who was sitting cross-legged. This man\u2019s entire head of black hair was adorned with an aged wooden hairpin. He was not wearing a crown, and he was wearing a sky-blue wide-sleeved robe with a\u00a0zhaowen\u00a0bag9\u00a0hanging from his waist.Qiao Tianya could not get a clear look at his face; all he could see was him idly plucking away at the strings. He would play a tune, then stop. A music score was laid out beside him. He was pondering it over when an gray-white kitten suddenly sprang onto his back and threaded its way around the sides of his neck to fish up locks of his hair with its paw to play with.This man carried the cat down and tucked it in his sleeve, his mind still on the zither. Qiao Tianya recognized the zither as his own. He stepped forward slowly and gradually came to see this man\u2019s face as his angle shifted.The willow catkins of the fourth lunar month in spring drifted, while the green velvet buds all hung out to dry under the resplendent sunlight This man was fair. Unlike Shen Zechuan\u2019s icy fairness, which looked as though he was immersed in frost, this man seemed more like a smooth white jade placed under the sunlight of spring. He did not have Shen Zechuan\u2019s cutting-edge sharpness, nor did he have Shen Zechuan\u2019s breathtaking allure. But he was in a class of his own\u2014ethereal, and unforgettable.Qiao Tianya used to be a young master of a family of officials. In this moment, he recalled a poem his eldest sister-in-law had previously recited.Such is the mountain of rocks like jade; as is the forest of pines like jadeite.His unrivaled beauty, one of a kind; second to none, a man divine.10Both of them had not even conversed with one another, and Qiao Tianya already knew who he was.\u201cTruly the epitome of a man of leisure.\u201d Qiao Tianya strode up the railings and set the tray down on the ground. \u201cNo need to keep looking at the score for this tune. If you\u2019re keen to learn, I can teach you.\u201dThis man lifted his eyes to look at him. He laughed and said, \u201cI think of wine, and the wine comes. I seek the tune, and the tune appears. Buddy, you\u2019re truly my lucky star.\u201d\u201cThe springtime landscape in this residence is excellent. A pity no one appreciates it. It\u2019s fate that I get to encounter you while enjoying the sights of spring. And it\u2019s still fate that I get to listen to this melody. Bosom guests are hard to come by in this world. I\u2019m no good at anything except playing the zither well. If you miss the opportunity that is me, then there will be no one else who is up to teaching you.\u201d Qiao Tianya poured wine for himself while standing. After drinking a cup, he tilted his chin at the man. \u201cSo, are you learning or not?\u201d\u201cServing one\u2019s teacher is akin to serving one\u2019s father.\u201d11\u00a0This man put down the zither and dangled his jade pendant to tease the cat. He said in a composed and unhurried manner, \u201cI can acknowledge you as my teacher, but to be someone\u2019s teacher, you must first convince the person.\u201dQiao Tianya stroked his slightly stubbled chin and said, \u201cI, Qiao Tianya, never lie. Acknowledge me if you\u2019re willing to believe me. Else, forget it.\u201dThis man loosened his grip on the jade pendant and looked at Qiao Tianya again. After a while, he smiled and said, \u201cI believe you.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8By the time Xiao Chiye returned to the Plum Blossom Residence, it was already dark. It was only when he dismounted that Chen Yang remembered and said as he led the horse, \u201cMaster, they said a few days ago that Young Master Yao has returned. Although he avoided the banquet, he will call on us to pay us a visit.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a hard one to track down. Who knows when his interest for a visit will come calling?\u201d Xiao Chiye took off his dusty and sweat-soaked outer robe and strode through the door to enter. \u201cIf he comes, tell the kitchen to prepare some light dishes for him. He has been with Secretariat Elder Hai long enough that he has grown accustomed to it and hardly consumes meat.\u201dGu Jin came out to them, then followed Xiao Chiye inside. Xiao Chiye stroked Meng, who was on his shoulder, and said, \u201cBring in some white meat and fresh water. It\u2019s tired out today too\u2014is my man here?\u201dGu Jin nodded and said, \u201cHe arrived a little less than an hour ago. He\u2019s currently handling official affairs in the study.\u201dXiao Chiye asked, \u201cHas he taken his meal?\u201dGu Jin replied, \u201cNo. His Excellency specially told the kitchen that he\u2019d wait for the Young Master to return before having dinner together.\u201dXiao Chiye looked at him as he turned his thumb ring around. Gu Jin got the hint and averted his gaze, not daring to stare at Xiao Chiye further. But Xiao Chiye\u2019s mood did indeed take a turn for the better. Before he entered the room, he took off\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0and tossed it to Gu Jin.\u201cGive the sheath a wipe.\u201d Xiao Chiye pulled up the front of his clothes to take a sniff of the scent on his own body. \u201cSend it in in a while. When it comes to sharpening the blade, I still ought to do it myself. Have someone keep an eye on the serving of dishes. There will be a lot going on tonight, but the water must be heated up enough. Where is Qiao Tianya? Have him take his Master\u2019s python robe to the laundry room and scent it with incense before the\u00a0morning court. That\u2019s all for now. You may go.\u201dGu Jin acknowledged his command and withdrew, and Xiao Chiye pushed the door open.Shen Zechuan had been inside listening for quite a while. He dipped the brush in ink without lifting his head and merely said, \u201cHow virtuous. The Second Young Master is truly a man after my own heart.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 : WealthXiao Chiye was conscious of the fact that he was reeking of sweat after having ran around the military drill grounds for the entire day, so he did not go around to the other side of the table but instead took his seat on this side. There were stacks of case files on the table, some of which were sealed with the Ministry of Justice\u2019s memorandum slip. From the time indicated on top, they were all from a very long time ago.\u201cYou\u2019re investigating old cases.\u201d Xiao Chiye put up one hand on the back of the chair and picked up the little bamboo fan that Shen Zechuan had set on the table to fiddle with. \u201cJust the\u00a0Imperial Prison\u2019s cases alone took you half a month to investigate. Why are you even looking at the cases from the Ministry of Justice now?\u201d\u201cThere was a vacuum in the\u00a0imperial prison\u00a0in the four years before the former emperor ascended to the throne.\u201d Shen Zechuan looked at the files. \u201cAt that time, Ji Lei had Pan Rugui as his backing, so it\u2019s unlikely he would muck around to the point where he did not have a single assignment. But the\u00a0imperial prison\u00a0did not leave any case records behind, proving that many cases of that time could still uphold the standard judicial process of the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices\u2019 Joint Trial. Ji Lei could only follow behind the Ministry of Justice running odd jobs for them.\u201d\u201cWhat I mean is.\u201d Xiao Chiye exerted a little force on two of his fingers to use the fan to block Shen Zechuan\u2019s view of the files and lifted his chin. \u201cWhat are we looking into the old cases for?\u201d\u201cIt was also here we previously discussed the case in which Zhongbo\u2019s troops were defeated.\u201d Shen Zechuan set down the brush. \u201cI spoke of \u2018befriending a distant state while attacking one nearby\u2019.1\u00a0Do you still remember?\u201dXiao Chiye withdrew the fan and rose to his feet. He sidestepped the table and walked towards the inner side of the bookshelf. After a while, he emerged, carrying a scroll of a map. Shen Zechuan pushed away the documents on the table, and Xiao Chiye tossed out the scroll to spread it out on the table. It was an extremely detailed military topographic map.\u201cThis is a treasure of mine I stashed away for special occasions.\u201d Xiao Chiye used the fan to draw a circle around the location of the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo. \u201cI naturally remember all that you\u2019ve said. You\u2019re referring to the fact that someone used the Biansha Cavalry to knock out the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo, which lies close to\u00a0Qudu. This is \u2018attacking a nearby state\u2019. Then, the Hua Clan fell into decline, and the Empress Dowager was forced to marry Hua the Third to Qidong. This is \u2018befriending a distant state\u2019. If we put these two together, then we can see that it\u2019s to take away Libei\u2019s powers by subtle means, rendering it powerless so that Libei would be caught in a predicament where it has no support nearby and no assistance from afar.\u201d\u201cBut the time such a game plan needs is too long, and the variables are countless. If the other party wants to ensure that every chess move he makes is without error, then he has to remain in a position where he can view the entire game.\u201d Shen Zechuan rose and slid his finger from Zhongbo on the map to\u00a0Qudu. \u201cHe has to be here. The former emperor reigned for eight years, which is too short to hatch a plot for the defeat of the Zhongbo\u2019s troops. The time has to be pushed forward. Many things have happened during Emperor Guangcheng\u2019s reign in the era of Yongyi, and these incidents have more or less influenced the direction in which the situation moved. He has to be somewhere within. I\u2019m thinking of using these old cases to find some clues.\u201dXiao Chiye looked at the map and said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get a full view of it just from the files alone. You have to find someone who was involved, or someone who knows the details.\u201dPropping himself up, Shen Zechuan looked aside at him and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have such a person.\u201dXiao Chiye returned the fan to Shen Zechuan and said, \u201cOn the contrary, I do have a candidate to recommend\u2026 but, what are you going to bribe me with?\u201dShen Zechuan smiled and grasped the other end of the fan, but he did not take it away. Instead, he simply looked at him in this way and said, \u201cLet me guess. The one you want to recommend to me is Yao Wenyu, right?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a member of the Yao Clan. He would indeed know better of the many incidents that had occurred during that period. What\u2019s more, he later went on to acknowledge Hai Liangyi as his teacher. Hai Liangyi has successively served in an official capacity in the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Personnel. He would, of course, know the details best.\u201d Xiao Chiye pulled the fan closer. \u201cOr, do you not care to meet him?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve long heard of his name.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cWhether he truly has the capabilities or is simply all form and no substance, I will know after meeting him. I do want to meet him. But when will he come? After today, I\u2019ll be tied down with work for the latter half of the month.\u201d\u201cEveryone else is queuing up to present their visitation cards2\u00a0to him so that they can meet him. Which of them has such the prestige as His Excellency Shen? \u201cXiao Chiye said with a smile.\u201cHe is like the banished immortal3\u00a0who has fallen from Heaven, not meant for me to use. So even if I rack my brain and try every means possible to play up to him, it\u2019d be a futile effort.\u201d What Shen Zechuan said was the truth. He had indeed heard of Yao Wenyu, but if they were to put this man together with Xue Xiuzhuo, he would rather choose Xue Xiuzhuo. This was because what they were doing was secular work; there were simply too many sordid matters down here. So even if one were to praise such an otherworldly divine being to the skies, he still did not have the inclination to woo said person over to their side.Scholars were basically and practically useless.4\u00a0Being an official was no less carefree than the courtesan prostituting herself in a brothel. Flattering those above you and trampling those under you; ingratiating yourself with another; taking a beating with a smile\u2014each one of these acts was an art in itself. That Hai Liangyi did not get Yao Wenyu to descend to this mundane world was already enough to get a glimpse of Yao Wenyu\u2019s temperament. Who could bear to hold an immortal down in the quagmire? Just let him remain free and happy as he always had been.But Xiao Chiye thought differently. However, he was in no hurry to voice it out and only said, \u201cI\u2019m merely a casual acquaintance of his. He has friends all over the world, but those who can truly sit with him for a chat are few and far between. His courteous but distant exchange of pleasantries is just the same as yours. You can just meet each other briefly and make an impression on each other. Should a need arise in the future, you\u2019d be able to make each other acquaintances.\u201dHearing him put it this way, Shen Zechuan did not turn it down further. Xiao Chiye would not recommend a person for no rhyme or reason. Shen Zechuan made a mental note of it, planning to get Qiao Tianya to free up some time later to meet him first.Xiao Chiye had spoken with Shen Zechuan as soon as he entered. It was extremely hot at the moment. The sweat he had worked up riding the horse on the way here had yet to dry up, and the sky outside had already gone dark. Seeing as his temples were still wet, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cGo take a bath and have a change of clothing. By the time you come out, you\u2019ll just be in time for dinner. We can discuss the other trivial matters later.\u201d\u201cVirtuous.\u201d Xiao Chiye lifted his leg to push aside the chair and suddenly bent over to hoist Shen Zechuan over his shoulder again. \u201cBeing considerate in words is only considered half of it. Let\u2019s bathe together. We get to save time, economize effort, and conserve water.\u201dShen Zechuan lowered his hand, wanting to correct the position of the brush that had been knocked askew. But Xiao Chiye had already taken a stride out to walk away. The hot water at the back was prepared pretty fast. Once the curtain was pulled down, it remained there for close to four hours. No one dared to interrupt the flow of firewood throughout. Chen Yang, being the most tactful, could read the situation best. Seeing as Xiao Chiye was about to take a bath, he instructed the kitchen to prepare the ingredients for the main dishes first, since there was no hurry to cook them as yet.Shen Zechuan understood one thing, which was that he could starve anyone but not Xiao Chiye. Xiao Chiye could not endure it the slightest. He would place all those days Shen Zechuan had owed him inside, demanding his repayment as he held him in his grip. He was full of vigor and energy, and whatever bit of capability Shen Zechuan had simply could not be compared to Xiao Chiye\u2019s diligence and thirst for learning.\u201cI know it all.\u201d Xiao Chiye reached a hand out to rub Shen Zechuan\u2019s right earlobe and clung close to Shen Zechuan\u2019s ear to say, \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry to discuss Xi Hongxuan\u2019s matter tonight. You\u2019ve been getting Ge Qingqing to scout around lately; are you looking for Ji Gang-shifu? The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0is keeping guard at the gates on our end. If there is an anomaly with the comings and goings, I\u2019ll send someone to notify you.\u201dShen Zechuan reddened from the rubs. He propped his back against Xiao Chiye\u2019s arm and closed his eyes to catch his breath, exposing his fair neck before him. His entire chest was heaving.\u201cOther than this.\u201d Xiao Chiye fastened the earring for him. \u201cThis Second Young Master will not talk about anything else tonight.\u201dShen Zechuan leaned forward, and the waves built up, layer by layer. He had a feeling of having a full stomach and on top of this, he tasted the pleasure and thrill of extreme abandon. It threw his consciousness into chaos, making him murmur vague words under his breath, so much that Xiao Chiye, hearing him, went numb all over.Between them, there was no putting away the wine cups after taking a tiny sip, only making merry to their hearts\u2019 content.5The undisguised desire was what they sought from the other. Both men needed that headlong rush of when they held each other. Every worry they had could all be washed away into oblivion by this extremely harmonious and passionate coupling. They never whispered sweet-nothings in the most intense moment, when the surge of lust and desire for love interweaved. Instead, they replaced them with kisses in unspoken agreement; the impassioned it was, the more they had to kiss.The water in the bathroom splashed all over the ground, and the steamy water vapor covered all remaining light from the window. The night was so deep, so quiet, that other than Shen Zechuan\u2019s voice, Xiao Chiye could not hear anything at all. He threw himself entirely into it, leaving nothing behind.By the time Xiao Chiye finally had his fair share, he had already lost all track of time. He brushed away Shen Zechuan\u2019s thoroughly soaked hair and caressed Shen Zechuan\u2019s wet cheeks. Shen Zechuan lifted his fair neck high, hooked him closer, and licked his lips wet.Xiao Chiye had yet to pull out. He kissed Shen Zechuan in this position and picked him up.Shen Zechuan let him kiss as he reached out his fingers to feel his way to the messy discharge. He rubbed it all on Xiao Chiye\u2019s body until he was utterly exhausted and drained.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8After they were done, Shen Zechuan ate a little porridge and got stuffed several more mouthfuls of steamed twisted rolls by Xiao Chiye. He had already changed into a clean inner garment. With Xiao Chiye\u2019s robe draped over him, he watched Xiao Chiye eat his meal.Xiao Chiye had an astonishing appetite lately. Shen Zechuan did not know what he was doing over at the military drill grounds at Mount Feng, but he keenly sensed that Xiao Chiye was not in a good mood today.\u201cGo sleep on the bed.\u201d Xiao Chiye lifted his head to glance and Shen Zechuan and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll catch a cold if you lie prone here.\u201dShen Zechuan moved a fish over and grasped his chopsticks to pick out the fish bones. He was indeed tired to the point he was dozing off, but he still took his time to say, \u201cThe repair and renovation of the military drill grounds have only just concluded, and there are enough funds to cover the costs. Looking at your expression though\u2026 is someone playing dirty tricks?\u201dXiao Chiye ate for a moment with a calm expression before he said, \u201cI want to add the blunderbuss6\u00a0to the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s arsenal.\u201dTough.Shen Zechuan instantly knew the reason for his displeasure today.At present, the blunderbuss was only allocated to the Eight Great Training Divisions. This stuff was valuable, and the Ministry of War would not assign it out easily, much less assign it to Xiao Chiye. Xiao Chiye had long set his eyes on them. The Eight Great Training Divisions had consigned this batch of bronze blunderbuss to their arsenal, where they had been sitting idly all this while. He had taken a few out to play with the last time, and it was from that time onwards that he started harboring the intent. But Xiao Chiye knew that this request of his would definitely hit a wall at the Ministry of War. Even Li Jianheng himself had no say in this matter, because it was of great significance, and the power to decide lay firmly in the hands of the Grand Secretary of the Grand Secretariat\u2014Hai Liangyi.Shen Zechuan thought for a moment. He held out the fish meat with his chopsticks to Xiao Chiye and said, \u201cThis thinking of yours in letting the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0test the waters in preparation for Libei\u2019s Armored Cavalry is too obvious. Considering the current situation in which they can\u2019t set you free, Hai Liangyi will no doubt disagree.\u201dXiao Chiye did not like to eat fish because he was too impatient to pick out the fish bones, but now that he tasted it, he found it to be still acceptable. He ate as much as Shen Zechuan fed him and only said when the chopsticks were set down, \u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t agree, I\u2019ll still think of ways to get my hands on them. Libei has military craftsmen. With the blueprint in hand, they should be able to copy it, like drawing a tiger with a cat as a model.\u201dAs long as they had the blueprint, everything else would be a breeze.\u201cIt\u2019s just that this blueprint is not easy to get our hands on.\u201d Shen Zechuan rinsed his mouth from Xiao Chiye\u2019s hands and thought for a moment before he continued, \u201cHai Liangyi keeps a pretty tight watch on this thing.\u201dBut Xiao Chiye was determined to have it, and the reason he had to have this thing was something Shen Zechuan understood the best.Hua Xiangyi was about to marry down to Qidong soon.\u00a0Qudu\u2019s strategy of \u201cbefriending a distant state while attacking one nearby\u201d was already beginning to take shape. Libei must make corresponding adjustments as soon as possible. The Libei Armored Cavalry was not an invincible army. The reason it remained infallible was that its two successive commanders-in-chief were resourceful and adaptable to changing circumstances. If the Qi Clan really fell out with Libei because of the marriage alliance, then, other than considering strategies to deal with the Biansha Cavalry, Libei would also need to consider tactics to deal with the Qi Clan\u2019s infantry.\u201cThe Minister of War, Chen Zhen, and Kong Qiu come from the same hometown. With this layer of connection, he could also be considered an official under Hai Liangyi. This man has some friendly relations with my father. He wouldn\u2019t necessarily even do my eldest brother a favor in the past. And now that it\u2019s come to me\u2026\u201d Recalling the displeasure of yesterday, Xiao Chiye paused for a moment before he merely said, \u201c\u2026 There got to be another way somehow.\u201dOnce Xiao Chiye had finished his meal, Shen Zechuan extinguished the lamp. Both men lay on the bed, sharing a pillow.Shen Zechuan had a plan in his mind and spoke up, \u201cIt\u2019ll be hard to go through Chen Zhen. Since he is from the same hometown as Kong Qiu, then it means he\u2019s from Qidong. Between Qidong and Libei, he would already have an inherent bias towards one. Blunderbuss\u2026 The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0might have the blueprint.\u201dXiao Chiye pulled him over for an embrace. He closed his eyes and said, \u201cXi Hongxuan has only just died, and those keys have already become a masterless gold mine. Everyone is watching you now; they are all dying to rip you apart to search for them. And you just happen to incur your colleagues\u2019 jealousy and envy at present. You need not bother with this matter\u2014Look here. This Second Young Master has a way.\u201dShen Zechuan did not answer. Instead, he smiled.Xiao Chiye slowly opened his eyes and said, \u201cThose two million taels of silver will not enter Libei. I\u2019ve already spoken to my eldest brother. The money will stop at Cizhou. You can take out these silvers anytime you go back there. You can\u2019t even play for nuts with four million taels. This Second Young Master wants to give you even more.\u201dThey were clearly trapped in\u00a0Qudu, yet the way he said it was so genuine and sincere. Perhaps Xiao Chiye had told lies in the past, but he would not lie at this very moment. He was like a wolf pup collecting and hoarding up the stars, wanting to stuff it all to Shen Zechuan like that entire jewelry box of pearls and jade earrings. More often than not, he carried it out in action than to voice it with words.On hearing this, Shen Zechuan suddenly looked back and said, \u201cActually, it\u2019s not just four million. Xi Hongxuan had indeed kept his keys securely hidden away. But he\u2019s no sage. It would be inevitable for him to divulge a word or two here and there to people close to him after hearing some pillow talk. The clandestine love affair between his eldest sister-in-law and Xi Dan had gone on for quite some time. Both of them were actually tricking the secret out of him all along\u2026 Sixty eight keys, thirty of which I know of\u2026 \u201cMeanwhile, Xiao Chiye, who was so poor that he was on the verge of selling his residences, was a little shamed into anger. He turned over to block off Shen Zechuan\u2019s mouth, biting him until Shen Zechuan gasped lightly for breath.\u201cXiao\u2019Er.\u201d Feeling the pain, Shen Zechuan was resentful. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014\u201dXiao Chiye pinched his chin to stop him from voicing it out. Both men toppled into the bedding, trading peremptory kisses.The wind outside the room came and went, leisurely and carefree, sending the wind chimes under the eaves tinkling.Ding Tao just happened to be on the rooftop feeding that plump sparrow of his. He had kept the sparrow in his sleeves, fishing it out from time to time to take a few looks at it. It was at this moment he heard the sound of the pillow being pushed off inside the room. He held the sparrow, wanting to stretch his head out for a look, but not daring to. Looking around, he saw his various\u00a0gege\u00a0each in their own respective daze. He gulped and said, \u201cI, I, uh\u2026 I guess I\u2019ll tell you a story. My father previously wrote it in the book. There was this\u2026\u201dQiao Tianya and Gu Jin kept their voices down and said evenly, \u201cYou shut up.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 : AssignmentWith such a great misfortune befalling the Xi Clan, and with Xi Hongxuan having no children to take over the mantle, the shops in the various localities all temporarily suspended operations. The shopkeepers sent letters to\u00a0Qudu, ready to set up a mourning hall in their old home and to discuss plans for the future.Sitting on the chair, Shen Zechuan instructed, \u201cThis journey is a far one to make, and you\u2019re also bringing along womenfolk. I don\u2019t feel reassured. Xiaowu, lead a few of our men to escort this Elder Brother Xi there.\u201dXi Dan understood the meaning in Shen Zechuan\u2019s words. Afraid to doubt him, he hurriedly kowtowed to show his gratitude.\u201cThere\u2019s only the Eldest Mistress who can head the Xi Clan now.\u201d Shen Zechuan glanced at the account books before him and said, \u201cPay some attention when you go back. Other matters are of no rush; stabilize the current situation first. Don\u2019t lose your head. The deal we had discussed a few days back can be temporarily set aside as well. Once you obtain the keys, keep a low profile, and check the money vault\u2019s entryways. A man\u2019s wealth is his own ruin by rousing greed in others. Now that you have to look after such a big business and also manage the money vault, you\u2019re bound to encounter some trouble.\u201dXi Dan naturally understood that he could only bank on Shen Zechuan for protection now. He was a smart man who, having followed Xi Hongxuan, knew best to assess the situation. Going all out to work for Shen Zechuan was precisely to prevent himself from being regarded as a sacrificial chess piece to be discarded by the latter.\u201cWith such guidance from Master, this lowly one dare not be sloppy. I\u2019ll do my best to stabilize the business for Master when I return to my hometown.\u201d\u201cXi Hongxuan trusted you that much all because you have the capabilities to speak of. He was overbearing and domineering in the past, and was only willing to get you to work on the accounts. But it\u2019s different now, and I\u2019m giving you the chance to show your mettle.\u201d Shen Zechuan set the account book aside without looking at him. \u201cBe honest in your work and play by the rules, and there will be plenty of chances for you to be in charge in the future. But if you deceive me, even by just one word, then I will claim this tongue of yours.\u201dHe said it lightly and breezily, but Xi Dan felt chilled to the marrow on hearing it. He hurriedly kowtowed again, not daring to look at Shen Zechuan further.It was noon after Shen Zechuan dismissed Xi Dan and when Ge Qingqing returned. Ge Qingqing entered and removed his blade, and the errand-runner at the side came over to serve him tea, which he downed in one gulp.\u201cNo one.\u201d Ge Qingqing pulled out a chair and sat down. He said, \u201cAll the Xi Clan\u2019s residences in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0have been thoroughly searched. There\u2019s no sign of Teacher and\u00a0shifu\u00a0whatsoever.\u201dShen Zechuan said nothing as he leaned against the chair in silence with a displeased expression.\u201cCould they be in a manor outside the city?\u201d Ge Qingqing wiped his sweat. \u201cThe Xi Clan has many manors out there too. Who knows, he might really have hidden them outside.\u201d\u201cShifu\u00a0isn\u2019t Teacher. It has been so long. He would surely think of a way to come back and see me. But he didn\u2019t.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s heart sank. \u201cThis shows that he\u2019s trapped somewhere; he can\u2019t come back.\u201dJi Gang was not Qi Huilian, who was too weak to truss even a chicken. There was almost no one who was his match in\u00a0Qudu. Perhaps there was a highly skilled expert among the men from the\u00a0martial fraternity\u00a0whom Xi Hongxuan had hired with a large sum of money. But now that Xi Hongxuan was dead, this group of martial artists should have already scattered and fled, busily dodging the pursuit of the imperial court. So, where in the world would they care about the detainees?\u201cCall Fei Sheng over.\u201d Shen Zechuan said, \u201cI have a mission for him.\u201dGe Qingqing was momentarily stunned, after which he said, \u201cThese people\u2026 Will he be willing to take it on?\u201d\u201cSince he is registered to serve in the\u00a0imperial prison,\u201d Shen Zechuan raised his eyes, his gaze cold, \u201cthen there is no \u2018unwilling\u2019 for him to speak of. If these people cannot be useful to me, then leaving them around will only lead to disastrous consequences in the future.\u201dThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0had no lack of talents, but those like Gu Jin, who could scout everywhere and anywhere with just a pair of eyes and ears, were few and far between. This Fei Sheng was a son of common birth born of a concubine. He was an assistant commander, one who inherited his father\u2019s original post in recognition of his meritorious services. This person was the most outstanding in conducting searches, but he was previously one-upped and overshadowed by Qiao Tianya. He hung on until it was finally the eighth year in which he could be considered for promotion, and made many trips to Marquis Helian\u2019s place of the same clan. He initially thought himself to be the one to assume the position of Northern Judge. Who would expect Shen Zechuan to appear out of nowhere? The latter completely severed his future prospects, keeping him stagnant in his original post to await orders.Fei Sheng was different from Ge Qingqing. He knew more about the circuitous official circles than Ge Qingqing, who came from an impoverished family background. He could even strike up a conversation with Han Cheng, who was his superior, and he could be considered half a disciple of Han Cheng. So, he was not like Ge Qingqing and the likes who had a former friendship with Ji Gang\u2014he totally did not give a damn about Ji Gang. At present, he was a heavyweight in the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, one on mutually antagonistic terms with Shen Zechuan. When Shen Zechuan was at the height of his glory a few months earlier, he had lain low and did not face Shen Zechuan head-on. But friction had been gradually building up in recent days.Shen Zechuan had wasted too much time examining old cases, and half of that time was wasted on these people. They heeded only half of the instructions he handed down to them, and they were sloppy in their search and gathering of the case files. On his end, Shen Zechuan had been unable to match the records to the reign and had to personally make a trip to the Ministry of Justice before he could put it all in order.The atmosphere between both sides was already beginning to get explosively belligerent. Ge Qingqing knew they were capable, but he still choked with resentment to be compared to them in such a manner. Yet, he also understood he was inferior to them. Finding the men was now the top priority, so he did not object and rose to go call Fei Sheng.Ge Qingqing lifted the curtain and walked out to see Fei Sheng in another room drinking wine and playing the finger-guessing game with others. He stood beside the door and said, \u201cAssistant Commander Fei, please make your way to the central room. His Excellency is calling for you.\u201dIt was as if Fei Sheng did not hear him as he stepped on the chair and shouted as he played with the others. For the entire room of people to be creating such a ruckus in broad daylight was truly a display of impropriety and disrespect.Ge Qingqing had never flared up or lost his temper at the others. He had been tagging along on missions with his old man ever since he was young, and he had seen all sorts of people. He knew how to take care of others, and he had a sense of propriety. He could make the acquaintances of even the squad commanders standing guard and errand-runners below him in rank. No matter how uncomfortable he was at present, he would never at this time pull a long face and show his displeasure at the other party. As such, he strode through the door and grabbed the wine jar on the table to personally pour a cup for Fei Sheng. He said courteously, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing major, and it\u2019s not a mission on His Majesty\u2019s order either. It won\u2019t take up that much time.\u201dTossing the peanuts, Fei Sheng said, \u201cIf it\u2019s not His Majesty\u2019s order, then just get one of the subordinates to go. What does it say of him to be singling out someone like me with rank and authority? That doesn\u2019t make sense, does it?\u201d\u201cHis Excellency naturally has his own arrangements. Whether you take it up or not can be negotiated.\u201d Ge Qingqing poured a cup for himself and clinked cups with him. \u201cIt has been hard on the various comrades to be checking the old cases these few days. Assistant Commander Fei has worked hard and achieved much. Here\u2019s a toast to you. Men of capabilities are always overworked. Please go.\u201dFei Sheng did not care to work for Shen Zechuan. He also boasted of being Shen Zechuan\u2019s senior, so Shen Zechuan was not qualified enough to order him around. But when all was said and done, they had to work together. He had no reason to create a scene without good cause; it would not sound good either, if news of it were to make its way to Han Cheng.Fei Sheng drank this cup of wine and smiled insincerely at Ge Qingqing. Without even answering him, he took his own waist token from the table and turned around to leave.Left behind and given the cold shoulder, Ge Qingqing set down the wine cup and cupped his hands to the surrounding\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0\u2013 each of whom wearing various expressions on their faces \u2013 and left too. The moment he retreated out, his own men also stood up.Ge Qingqing wiped his mouth and said, \u201cWhy are you all standing up? There\u2019s no need for formalities between us brothers. Sit.\u201dXiaowu, who was of similar age to Ding Tao, could not refrain from wearing his heart on his sleeve. He said in anger and resentment, \u201cLook at his eyes growing on top of his head. He walks like a tyrant, all so overbearing and puffed up with his own importance that he has no fear karma might hit him hard in the face someday.1\u00a0What kind of an honorable man is he, acting all like a snob? Bah! Qing-ge, why do we even put up with him? Remove his token and drag him out, then cover him with a sack and bash him up. See if he still doesn\u2019t learn to behave himself!\u201dGe Qingqing rebuked, \u201cWhat insolent remarks are you spouting? If news that we beat up our own people gets out, we will be making a mockery of ourselves!\u201d He looked at every one of them and continued, \u201cWe are all attending to official duties together. We mustn\u2019t leave any misunderstandings or unhappiness festering. Otherwise, how can we all look out for each other when we are on a mission? Since they look down on us, then we\u2019ll work harder to prove ourselves.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Fei Sheng lifted the curtain to enter and sloppily paid his respects before the table. He still reeked of wine, the smell strong enough for Shen Zechuan to catch a whiff of it from where he was across the table.Without lifting his head, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cDrinking on duty is punishable by a deduction from your salary, yes?\u201dSeeing that Shen Zechuan did not get up, Fei Sheng pulled the chair over. But before his ass could touch the chair, Shen Zechuan looked at him.Shen Zechuan unhurriedly let out a smile. \u201cSit.\u201dFei Sheng could not tell what he was up to. He sat down and asked, \u201cWhat can I do for your Excellency, since you are looking for me?\u201dShen Zechuan replied, \u201cThere\u2019s an assignment that no one else can do except you.\u201dSeeing as he had something to ask of him, Fei Sheng could not help but relax. He touched the pipe in his sleeve pocket and started to put on airs, first saying, \u201cIs it a prison assignment? If it\u2019s an order from the Commander-in-chief, then pass me the official paperwork and I\u2019ll be able to work on it.\u201dShen Zechuan tapped away the excess ink on the brush tip and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a prison assignment, and it\u2019s not an order from the Commander-in-chief.\u201dFei Sheng struck the flint and bit down on his pipe as he laughed and said, \u201cThen it\u2019s Your Excellency\u2019s order? I can do it, but I still have a mission to keep track and record of late. Isn\u2019t this just in time for the fourth month? I have to keep an eye on the price fluctuations of\u00a0Qudu\u2019s daily necessities of firewood, rice, oil, and salt.\u201dThe so-called \u201ckeep track and record\u201d was to have the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0record all minor and major matters in a book, including the prices of grains, rice, noodles, and tea; these were to be reported to Li Jianheng and Hai Liangyi whenever necessary. But this assignment did not have to be personally carried out by Fei Sheng. He was a fourth-grade assistant commander, and the only assignments in which he could be dispatched out were for arrests and fieldwork. By putting it this way, he was, in truth, not planning to take on the assignment.\u201cWhy use an ox-cleaver to kill a chicken?2\u00a0Having you do that is simply a waste of talent.\u201d Shen Zechuan said.\u201cI am a person of mediocre ability to begin with. I cannot be compared to such a naturally talented hero like Your Excellency. You are already a third-grade Vice Commander at such a young age, and His Majesty looks upon you favorably. What\u2019s more, you are a man of elegance and poise.\u201d Fei Sheng blew out puffs of smoke. \u201cMen like us can only do some lowly work to muddle our way through. We don\u2019t dare to dream of anything else, and we don\u2019t dare to be one either. Wait for a few days. I\u2019ll have free time only after a few days.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cThis assignment cannot wait.\u201dFei Sheng moistened his dry throat and half-leaned over to look at Shen Zechuan to say, \u201cThen what can I do? Each matter has its own priorities. I have to finish the task at hand before I can take on your assignment. This is the rule set by Ji Wufan back then, and I can\u2019t break it. So, you\u2019ll have to wait.\u201dShen Zechuan, having received that smoke right in his face, looked at how fearless his expression was and knocked the ashes away to the edge of the table. Capitalizing on his status, and thinking that Shen Zechuan could not keep him under control, Fei Sheng slid the chair away and prepared to bid him farewell.Shen Zechuan suddenly extended his fingers to tack a slip of paper before Fei Sheng and said, \u201cI can wait. But can the Assistant Commander wait? This year is your promotion year. But coincidentally, the Provincial Administration Commissioner of Juexi, Jiang Qingshan, is about to enter the capital to report for work. Surely you understand the Grand Secretariat\u2019s intent by having Jiang Qingshan enter the capital at this point in time. He will be going to Zhongbo to be the person-in-charge, and this person lacks an\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0Inspector-General by his side\u2026 So, is Assistant Commander Fei still busy?\u201dJiang Qingshan was a Provincial Governor who was outstanding in his governance of the area within his jurisdiction, having forged ahead and turned Juexi into Dazhou\u2019s granary. Libei\u2019s and Qidong\u2019s army provisions all came from him. This person was someone whom even Xiao Jiming and Qi Zhuyin could not afford to offend. Working for him meant that there would be nothing to worry about one\u2019s future prospects. Fei Sheng could not advance any further in ranks. He had to find external help. But because he was a son of common birth born of a concubine, he could not get to play together with all the bona fide direct descendants born of the principal wives like Han Jin, Fei Shi, and Pan Lin. Without that layer of connection, he could not make his way up through the ranks. Being stuck in this position made him feel shitty all over. Otherwise, he would not greet Shen Zechuan with such biting sarcasm and mockery.Fei Sheng hurriedly extinguished the pipe and rubbed his palms at the sides of his legs. He bent over slightly and said to Shen Zechuan with a smile, \u201cLook at me, not knowing what\u2019s good for me! What assignment? Tell me.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cI want you to turn over the entire\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to search for two men.\u201d\u201cSearch openly, or\u2026\u201d Fei Sheng looked at Shen Zechuan and gradually cottoned on. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s easily done. I\u2019m good at this. Give me their descriptions, Your Excellency. Five days. I\u2019ll definitely find them for you!\u201dShen Zechuan lowered his voice and said, \u201cI\u2019m only giving you two days.\u201dFei Sheng looked at the slip of paper, clenched his teeth, and accepted!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 : Former ResidenceHua Xiangyi and Qi Shiyu\u2019s wedding was scheduled to take place on the eve of the Grain in Ear1\u00a0in the fourth month. The Ministry of Rites had already submitted the drawn-up process to the Empress Dowager. The internal affairs of the palace were numerous and complex, so when it came to such a major affair, the key government offices could not afford to be lacking in personnel.Fuman originally thought himself to be the perfect candidate for the position of the\u00a0Directorate of Ceremonial\u00a0Seal-holding Director. He had the qualification and experience, having attended the Eunuch School2\u00a0and having been in charge of managing the affairs in the Grand Secretariat and Mingli Hall. Plus, he had Xiao Chiye to vouch for him. As such, he was even more discreet and cautious as he attended to his official duties these days.Unexpectedly, when the imperial edict was issued, the Seal-holding Director turned out to be Fengquan and not him. Fengquan was young, and he had little experience to speak of. He had never studied in the Eunuch School. What\u2019s more, he was a junior eunuch who was already over the usual age when he entered the palace. His connection to the former Pan Rugui and Ji Lei was one that could never be severed clean. To let him take on this post that was comparable to that of an \u201cinner minister\u201d\u2014Fuman really did not know if he should cry or sigh.\u201cThe promotion of an outer court official depends on his family social standing, place of origin, and teacher or master he tutored under. I thought the promotion of us inner court eunuchs would be exempt from this hurdle of family background and status. But, damn.\u201d Fuman set down the teacup and let loose a long sigh. \u201cWho knew that we still can\u2019t cross this hurdle after all!\u201d\u201cWhat family background does he have?\u201d Xiao Chiye listened to Fuman\u2019s grouses and said as he leisurely drank his tea, \u201cHe\u2019s only benefiting off his elder sister\u2019s glory.\u201d\u201cYour Lordship, why is it that I don\u2019t have a sister?!\u201d Fuman slapped his knee and lamented.Xiao Chiye snorted a laugh and said, \u201cIf the seal isn\u2019t available, there\u2019s still the brush. The Brush-holding Director also manages the\u00a0Eastern Depot. Old Fu, by letting him take the lead at the head of the pack, you\u2019ll get to escape the spittles of imperial censors.\u201d\u201cHis Majesty\u2019s current treatment of me can\u2019t be compared to the former emperor\u2019s treatment of Pan Rugui, and the\u00a0Eastern Depot\u00a0isn\u2019t as influential as the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards.\u201d Fuman hesitated, then said, \u201cYour Lordship, looking at how favored Her Ladyship Mu is at present, if she were to give birth to an imperial heir in the future, then wouldn\u2019t Fengquan secure this position completely? Never mind if he is one who knows his place. I fear that he harbors an ulterior motive and ends up breaking the imperial court\u2019s laws and throwing the state into chaos. Wouldn\u2019t that make him the second Pan Rugui?\u201dFuman had to greet Fengquan with a smiling face in the palace, but in truth, he was jealous and sickened of him. Fengquan had Mu Ru as a backer. If Fuman, who had been supplanted by him, wanted to stand up to him as an equal in the\u00a0Directorate of Ceremonial, he had to win over the outer court officials.\u201cHe is young, and he still has to rely on you for many matters. You often move around the Grand Secretariat, and you are a known figure to the Grand Secretary. If one were really to compare, he is merely a lad who usurps what is others\u2019. He is no one worthy of mention.\u201d Xiao Chiye comforted him in his manner, then said, \u201cWith us looking out after each other from within and without, we needn\u2019t fear him. How is it going in the palace lately?\u201d\u201cSecond Young Master Xi is dead. His Majesty still thinks of the tune he had yet to complete and felt sad for a few days.\u201d Fuman turned sideways to look at Xiao Chiye. \u201cBut Your Lordship, while I was serving tea to the various excellencies in the Grand Secretariat, I inferred from Minister Wei\u2019s words that he still wants to investigate the Xi Clan\u2019s accounts. The Xi Clan caused such a big commotion at the harbor, and there is no head of household this time. Such a big business may be likened to a piece of fatty meat\u2014it\u2019s a gold mine. They are all eyeing it!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t his family still alive?\u201d Xiao Chiye and Shen Zechuan had discussed the follow-up plans for the Xi Clan. Those keys had fallen into Shen Zechuan\u2019s hands, and in Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes, these were Shen Zechuan\u2019s trousseau. Biding his time, he said, \u201cXi Hongxuan\u2019s eldest sister-in-law, and Xi Hongxuan\u2019s various cousins are all skilled in managing the business, and they have not committed any crimes. By investigating their accounts for no apparent reason, Minister Wei would be accused of hitting a man when he\u2019s down.\u201d\u201cHis Majesty didn\u2019t agree. But the Grand Secretary seems\u2026\u201d Fuman moved his arm onto the table and said to Xiao Chiye, \u201c\u2026 seems to have the intent to pursue the accounts too.\u201dHai Liangyi naturally has his own considerations. The Xi Clan had too much silver hidden away. Rather than let the remaining few clans divide it up among themselves, they might as well take that money into the state treasury and let the imperial court manage it. But this meant that Hai Liangyi had to fight with the noble clans head-on.\u201cThe key is still His Majesty.\u201d Xiao Chiye thought for a moment and said to Fuman, \u201cHis Majesty is a wise ruler, and he\u2019s the most particular about benevolence and righteousness. It was only just last month that he granted a general amnesty. Wouldn\u2019t raiding and confiscating the Xi Clan\u2019s properties and possessions for no rhyme or reasons this month run contrary to the original intent of the amnesty? His Majesty is also hesitating himself. Old Fu, Fengquan will no doubt go along with Minister Wei for this matter. If you go along too, then it will instead look like you\u2019re blindly going along with the flow. Why not use the opportunity while you are serving His Majesty to tell His Majesty in detail that it is inadvisable to go ahead with this matter at present?\u201dThe gears turned in Fuman\u2019s head. He said, \u201cWon\u2019t this offend Minister Wei?\u201d\u201cWhether inside or outside the palace, there is only one master, and that is His Majesty.\u201d Xiao Chiye smiled. \u201cPan Rugui was powerful and influential too, but he did not throw in his lot with the emperor. I\u2019m not at all surprised that he ended up executed. Besides, how can Mingli Hall tolerate tongues wagging? How would he, Wei Huaigu, know of the words you say to His Majesty? His Majesty likes people who are sentimental. You don\u2019t have to persuade for the sake of persuasion. Just mention it in passing.\u201d\u201cI shall listen to Your Lordship\u2019s advice.\u201d Fuman was all smiles, looking warm and affable. \u201cIn any case, this money won\u2019t land in our pockets. We all might as well not want it!\u201d\u201cThe Ministry of Revenue has been tabulating the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s accounts for the medicinal herbs used at the Zhao Zui Temple for quite a number of days. How\u2019s it? Have you heard anything of it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been done and has already been submitted to His Majesty\u2019s desk. Nothing is wrong.\u201d Fuman knew that Liang Cuishan, from the Ministry of Revenue who was entrusted to handle this account, had been nominated by Xiao Chiye, so he said, \u201cHis Excellency Liang is truly something to sort out and keep the accounts in such clear order. He could even answer readily and smoothly when the Grand Secretary quizzed him about it. Looks like he\u2019s on his way to a promotion too!\u201dThus, Xiao Chiye asked no further. When Fuman was leaving, Chen Yang gave him the new tea from Hezhou they had prepared in advance. Fuman\u2019s hands sank when he received it, and so he knew that there was something inside. He pretended to decline it, and it was only after Chen Yang repeatedly persuaded him that he finally accepted.The next day, when the court was dismissed, Xiao Chiye waited outside Mingli Hall for himself to be summoned. Shen Zechuan was there too. Both men stood an appropriate distance away\u2014not too far, not too close.\u201cThere are people everywhere probing into the Xi Clan\u2019s properties these few days.\u201d Xiao Chiye removed\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0and handed it to Shen Zechuan, taking the opportunity when Shen Zechuan received it to hold down his hand slightly. \u201cYour Excellency ought to move fast soon.\u201dShen Zechuan seemed to have something else on his mind. On hearing him, he lifted\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0and said, \u201cYeah, he has already left\u00a0Qudu\u00a0and is rushing back with the coffin in tow. There should be news next month.\u201d\u201cHai Liangyi is not the same as the others. He has made up his mind to take the Xi Clan\u2019s family properties into the state treasury. No matter how fast your man rushes, he will still lose the advantage of the first strike.\u201d Xiao Chiye found Shen Zechuan a little distracted; thus, he released his grip.Shen Zechuan\u2019s palm sank. Barely able to hold up\u00a0Langli Blade, he said, \u201c\u2026 No matter how fast he is, he still has to play by the rules and follow procedures.\u201dXiao Chiye cast a glance at Mingli Hall\u2019s corridor and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dShen Zechuan replied, \u201cI\u2019m looking for someone.\u00a0Shifu\u00a0is missing.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cAs long as there is no passage document issued, he is still in\u00a0Qudu. The Eight Great Training Divisions would not dare to let people in and out without authorization during the epidemic. And the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0took over the patrol after the epidemic. If Ji Gang-shifu\u00a0has already left, I should have news on my end.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also guessing that he\u2019s still in\u00a0Qudu.\u201d Shen Zechuan paused for a moment. \u201cXi Hongxuan only did what he did to take Teacher away.\u00a0Shifu\u00a0went along for the sake of protecting Teacher. He shouldn\u2019t have been held up for this long. But if Teacher is still in danger, then\u00a0Shifu\u00a0definitely won\u2019t be able to leave on his own.\u201d\u201cXi Hongxuan is already dead.\u201d Xiao Chiye turned his eyes slightly to look at the other end. \u201cTime to get someone to check that gentleman\u2019s house.\u201dShen Zechuan followed Xiao Chiye\u2019s gaze. On that end, Xue Xiuzhuo, dressed in official robes, was approaching them together with Jiang Qingshan.Xue Xiuzhuo was plain in appearance, but he had a scholarly and refined bearing. He was not the same type as Kong Qiu, Cen Yu, and the likes. He was gentle towards the others, making it likely for the others to form a favorable impression of him. On the contrary, Jiang Qingshan was not what one would expect. The formidable heavyweight of Juexi from the rumors actually looked younger than his actual age.Both of them drew close, and the four men greeted each other.In the past, when Jiang Qingshan came to\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to report on his work, he had only seen Xiao Chiye from afar at the Banquet of A Hundred Officials. As for Shen Zechuan, it was his first time meeting him. But his heart was not in this, so he was neither warmhearted nor pretentious towards them.\u201cMany old cases were closed this year, and it\u2019s all thanks to the contributions of Assistant Minister Xue and the various excellencies from the Ministry of Justice. His Majesty will surely lavish you with praises today when we meet with him.\u201d Xiao Chiye said to Xue Xiuzhuo with a smile.Xue Xiuzhuo smiled too, shaking his head slightly as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s all due to His Excellency the Minister\u2019s perceptive and wise judgments that the cases could be closed. I merely assisted him from the side. How is it considered a contribution? On the contrary, it\u2019s Vice Commander Shen who straightened out and put those disorganized case files into order again. It has indeed been hard on him.\u201dShen Zechuan looked at Xue Xiuzhuo and said, \u201cThe\u00a0imperial prison\u00a0has an archive I can check. These matters are something that even a common clerk would be able to handle.\u201dXue Xiuzhuo\u2019s expression betrayed nothing. Other than Jiang Qingshan, the other three were all feigning civility. Jiang Qingshan seemed as though he did not want to get involved. He merely stood at the side and said nothing.Fuman lifted the curtain and came out to call out their names. Only then did the four men move together into Mingli Hall. As Shen Zechuan strode in, he instantly caught sight of Fengquan, who was serving at the side beneath Li Jianheng\u2019s dragon throne. Both men\u2019s eyes met, and Fengquan smiled.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Fei Sheng prided himself on being number one when it came to conducting searches. There had never been a person he could not find. Yet, there was still no trace of Ji Gang and Qi Huilian even after he had gone through the entire\u00a0Qudu\u00a0these two days.Ge Qingqing had followed him all the way. When he saw that Fei Sheng had now lost his arrogance and had been silent all this while, he asked, \u201cIs there a possibility that they have been taken out of the city?\u201dFei Sheng was serious when he was attending to official duties. Not looking at anyone, he squatted at the bottom side of the Xi Clan\u2019s burned veranda and said, \u201cUnlikely. Since one of them had extraordinary skills, then it is only by taking them down on the spot that would ensure no traces will be left behind. For this kind of matter, the more the commotion, the easier it is to be exposed.\u201dGe Qingqing took a few steps back and surveyed this mansion with spacious halls and extensive gardens. He said, \u201cBut if he had hidden them at home, then how could it have escaped the searches of our brothers? We have long done a thorough search of this residence.\u201d\u201cAlthough I have never befriended or associated with Xi Hongxuan, I have heard of his temperament.\u201d Fei Sheng rose. \u201cHe was suspicious by nature. So the more important things were to him, the more he would have kept them close to him. Because he did not trust others. Since these two men are so important, he would definitely not put them in a place far away from him\u2026\u201dFei Sheng\u2019s voice gradually trailed off. He climbed up along the scorched wall and pushed aside the various branches to look over next door.\u201cThat\u2019s Prince Qin\u2019s Manor.\u201d Ge Qingqing climbed up after him and crouched down to look inside.\u201cDeserted for many years\u2026\u201d Fei Sheng jumped down and took a few steps into the painted corridor, where he saw the paint at the top had already peeled off. It was all gray and drab all around, covered thick with cobwebs. He used his Xiuchun Blade3\u00a0to pick off the cobwebs and tried pushing the doors with paper seals.4\u201cThat\u2019s right. It has indeed fallen into disuse for many years.\u201d Ge Qingqing looked around. \u201cYou suspected he hid them here?\u201dAs soon Fei Sheng touched the door, he knew something was wrong. He said, \u201cA decades-old manor, yet the seals are merely covered in dust. Something\u2019s fishy!\u201dHe took half a step back and abruptly kicked the door open.Author\u2019s Notes:I saw someone question the need to keep considering the issue of ingots transportation instead of using banknotes outright. I\u2019ll explain it here so that those with the same question can also understand the reasoning behind this.Because I did not define banknote banks in my setting. If such a setting were to exist, then it must be able to contain Xi clan\u2019s wealth and completely be beyond the imperial court\u2019s control. It\u2019d be considered as a self-made entity by the merchants, and therefore, it must have a high credit rating to ensure that the banknotes issued under its banner can be used. Four million taels is no small sum. Even if they were converted into banknotes, they\u2019d still be subjected to inspection during transportation. The banknotes would also need to be protected against humidity and fire hazards. Most importantly, because they are not officially issued by the imperial court, there is no guarantee that its usage across the various lands of Dazhou will be problem-free. As an example, for this amount of money to come out of the Juexi, it must be converted to banknotes at the banks in Juexi, but once it reaches Zhongbo or Libei, it remains a question of whether or not the banknotes can be exchanged for the same value.If the setting were to include official banknotes, then events such as the defeat of Zhongbo troops, corruption amongst government officials, power struggles among political factions, and the emptying of the state treasury during the era of Xiande have resulted in the Ministry of Revenue being unable to audit their own accounts clearly. They would have even less capacity to issue and distribute official banknotes and paper currency. The issuance and distribution of such have strict requirements for the notes\u2019 materials as well as a standardized credit limit. So even if banknotes were used, there is also no way a few banknotes could net four million, given the limit on credit. If we were to consider using denominations of one tael, five taels, ten taels, and so on, the transfer of four million banknotes could only resolve the issue of weight. Subsequently, if the imperial court were to have a change of sovereign, or if the Xi Clan were to be brought to ruins, then whether or not these banknotes will depreciate in value or render void will also prove to be another source of headache as well.Actually, there is an aspect of the Xi Clan\u2019s setting. I\u2019m not sure if everyone has noticed. It\u2019s that the Xi Clan controls the salterns and copper mines. The copper mines mean that they can mint their own copper coins, as long as they have a firm grasp on the relative purity standard of Dazhou\u2019s copper currency\u2026 This is the fundamental reason they can pit themselves against the rest of the\u00a0Eight Great Clans. Besides, isn\u2019t the large amount of silver warehouses in their possession also an indication that they have, in fact, already been mining silver in private and have the potential to manipulate the flow of silver in the market?Of course, these are a few words from whatever little information I have on hand. Because I\u2019m not familiar with the know-how in this field, I\u2019m not comfortable with blindly adding in the setting of banknotes and banks. In the case of silver, it makes more sense to only consider the relative purity standard of silver.Many areas are problematic if we were to probe deeper into it, so thank you for your tolerance and understanding! As a result, today\u2019s chapter isn\u2019t much, sorry! But now that today\u2019s matter has been dealt with, we will return to our old schedule tomorrow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 : Imperial HeirThe door panel fell to the ground with a loud \u201cthud\u201d, strewing accumulated dust all over. Fei Sheng covered his nose and mouth and strode in to check all the corners, not missing a single one.This was the former residence of Prince Qin. Although it had fallen into a state of disrepair for years, one could still get a glimpse of its former opulence and grandeur. Fei Sheng lit the candle he carried on him, extinguished the lighter,1\u00a0and headed into the inner chamber.\u201cThe bed-curtain and beddings are all new.\u201d Ge Qingqing lifted the drape and looked at the bed.\u201cThere were still people staying here a few days ago.\u201d Fei Sheng stopped beside the table and pushed aside the teapot cover to reveal the residual tea stains within. \u201cThey drank spring tea from the Baimazhou Prefecture of Juexi. Looks like Xi Hongxuan did not treat them shabbily.\u201dGe Qingqing saw the bloodstains when he inspected the bed, and his heart began to pound. He lifted the entire quilt, then took a sudden step back.Hidden under the quilt on the bed was a putrid-smelling corpse with obvious signs of livor mortis. This person had obviously been dead for a few days. Fei Sheng held up the light to inspect the corpse.\u201cThis person was strangled to death.\u201d Fei Sheng pointed to the corpse\u2019s throat. \u201cIt was crushed outright.\u201d\u201cThere are bloodstains.\u201d Ge Qingqing said. \u201cHe had wounds inflicted with a blade before he died.\u201d\u201cNot only that. Look at his neck. There are two sets of strangulation marks, which means that the first time did not kill him. How could those men Xi Hongxuan hired from the\u00a0martial fraternity\u00a0alone be capable of forcing the\u00a0shifu\u00a0into such a corner?\u201d As Fei Sheng spoke, he used his blade to prop up the corpse and slowly turned the body over. \u201cThere\u2019s no anomaly with the livor mortis; so he shouldn\u2019t have been poisoned. The gashes on his back are in such a mess. Obviously, a layman who knows nothing of swordsmanship had haphazardly hacked away at him. The blade missed the vital points; that\u2019s why he chose to choke him to death. They should have joined forces to kill this man. I suspect the\u00a0shifu\u00a0was injured. It\u2019s likely he was too physically weak, and the Teacher had no choice but to take up the blade himself as a last resort.\u201dThe more Ge Qingqing heard, the more alarmed he was. He said, \u201cSince the corpse could be laid out in such a neat and orderly manner, does it mean that Teacher and\u00a0Shifu\u00a0have not reached the point of panic yet? As long as\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the corpse was laid out by others.\u201d Fei Sheng surveyed the place again. \u201cThere are no traces of a fight here either\u2026 I think\u00a0Shifu\u00a0was injured and did not have the means to display his prowess with ease, that\u2019s why he needs Teacher\u2019s help. But their second transfer was definitely not arranged by Xi Hongxuan, because none of those martial artists he hired from the\u00a0martial fraternity\u00a0would dare to set themselves against the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0for just a bit of money. Whether or not this corpse is one of the martial artists remains to be seen. If it isn\u2019t\u2014\u201dFei Sheng\u2019s words came to an abrupt halt. He was willing to work for Shen Zechuan because he was eyeing the lucrative post. If this matter was not a personal grudge, then it was going to involve court strife. He did not want to put himself right in the middle of it, so he did not finish the second half of his words\u2014If it wasn\u2019t a martial artist, then this kind of highly skilled expert could only come from the imperial palace, and this corpse was possibly from the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0themselves.Ge Qingqing understood his concerns. Both men fell into a silent stalemate. This house was creepy and eerie, so continuing to stand here like this was not an option.Fei Sheng retracted his blade and said, \u201cThey are most certainly in\u00a0Qudu. Each of the officials\u2019 residences and princes\u2019 manors has specialized bodyguards to stand guard. Their doors are tightly shut, and there are secret passages built inside. It\u2019s simply too easy if they want to hide a few people. Sorry, this humble one is unlearned and of little talent. I can only search this far for His Excellency Shen!\u201dWith that, he cupped his hands to Ge Qingqing and stepped out the way he came in. He mounted his horse and headed back to turn in his report.From where he was in his spot, Ge Qingqing saw that trail of blood drag all the way to the ground. So he followed the blood trail and kneeled while propping himself up on the ground to look under the bed. It was even darker beneath the bed, and there seemed to be something there. Ge Qingqing reached out to fish it out, but it turned out to be a handful of ashes. Ge Qingqing blew away the ashes, leaving only a fingernail-sized piece of paper in his palm.It was the remnants of handwritten notes that Qi Huilian had not thoroughly burned away.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan closed his eyes. Sandwiched between his fingers was the piece of paper that had been burned yellow. There were only a few words remaining on it, yet these were words he was the most intimately acquainted with.Qi Huilian\u2019s handwritten notes touched upon quite a number of matters. They were all treatises on contemporary politics they discussed back then in Zhao Zui Temple. Every little thing he had taught Shen Zechuan, and every inside story about the eunuchs he knew when he served as Grand Mentor, were all in the notes. During the epidemic, Qiao Tianya had transferred them all to store in the loft for Qi Huilian to safekeep personally.To prevent the information in them from leaking, Qi Huilian had his own way of reading them. What treatise it was and how to read it were all something he had thought over himself during his spare time at the temple. If one were to read them in the usual order, quite the number of matters would appear to be just a jumble of words, much like the ravings of a lunatic\u2014totally incoherent and incomprehensible.But, he burned it. Was it because he was forced by circumstances, or because he was worried that the one detaining him would be able to read it?Qiao Tianya, who had been leaning against the wall, involuntarily straightened up when he saw Shen Zechuan stepping out. Shen Zechuan swiftly walked down the steps and said, \u201cPrepare the carriage.\u201dNoting that it was already getting late, Qiao Tianya knew where he wanted to go. The inconspicuous and common horse carriage set off and circled twice on Shenwu Street before reaching the Plum Blossom Residence.\u201cWhere is His Lordship?\u201d Shen Zechuan got off the carriage and asked.On seeing his solemn expression, Ding Tao did not dare to play around and replied honestly, \u201cHis Lordship has just gone out to invite that Eldest Master Xue for a drink. He will return later. Your Excellency, do you need me to go and call His Lordship back? It\u2019s just a few streets away.\u201dFor Xiao Chiye to invite Xue Xiuyi for a drink at this moment, he must also be trying to probe deeper into Xue Xiuzhuo. The Xue Residence was not an easy one to investigate. It was far more convenient to have an insider like Xue Xiuyi around than to send someone to grope around in the dark for clues.Shen Zechuan walked into the courtyard and said, \u201cYou just need to tell him that I\u2019ll be resting here tonight. Tell him to come back after he\u2019s done drinking. Don\u2019t stay out all night. But also tell him there\u2019s no hurry; there\u2019s no need for him to rush back immediately. Xue Xiuyi is not an easy one to dismiss at will.\u201dDing Tao uttered an acknowledgment and left. Qiao Tianya followed Shen Zechuan and asked, \u201cWhy the sudden hurry?\u201d\u201cXi Hongxuan didn\u2019t trust anyone, but he trusted Xue Xiuzhuo.\u201d Shen Zechuan headed up the stairs under the dim light from the lantern. \u201cThat last time Xi Dan defrauded him, he rather suspected Xi Dan than to suspect Xue Xiuzhuo. He always had to ask about everything. Having gotten hold of Teacher this time, he no doubt wouldn\u2019t dare to act on his own.\u201dBefore his death, Xi Hongxuan was so sure that Shen Zechuan would lose. Why? He must have known something that Shen Zechuan still did not know as yet. Xi Hongxuan\u2019s promotion to the Bureau of Evaluations was on Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s suggestion. He heeded Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s advice that much\u2014Why would he?Shen Zechuan suddenly paused in his steps and stood where he was.The Xue Clan had already been on the decline for a long time. Xi Hongxuan would never comply and put himself at the disposal of a down-and-out person. He would also never be that easily won over by anyone. They came to associate with each other through the solidarity between fellow students. Because both clans were related by marriage in the previous generations, they had ties of kinship and friendship between them. But, what did Xue Xiuzhuo use to maintain his hold over Xi Hongxuan? Xi Hongxuan put profit before anything else. He could even kill his dear blood brother on a whim. It was impossible for Xue Xiuzhuo to gain his trust of such proportion with just that flimsy bit of blood relationship alone.Shen Zechuan started to grow apprehensive for no reason. He looked at the eaves. The shadow was like a threatening beast, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws. It had already bitten half of his body between its sharp fangs. Clues that he could not pry apart clearly were just like the dense clusters of water weeds that, along with the colors of the night, entangled and tied down his hands and legs, giving him an inkling of the danger.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8When Xiao Chiye saw Ding Tao come in midway through his drinking session with Xue Xiuyi that he had invited the latter to, he knew that Shen Zechuan had returned to the residence. As he socialized with the other man, he gave Ding Tao a slight nod to indicate his awareness of it.Xue Xiuyi was half-drunk again. He wanted to call a few prostitutes down for company. But Xiao Chiye said nothing of this, so he did not dare to call for them rashly. Still grabbing the wine cup, he said to Xiao Chiye even as his wine-induced hiccups persisted, \u201cHe\u2026 Xue Yanqing! That batch of fledglings he is raising in the residence, he specifically put them in a big courtyard, and even habitually hire\u2026 hire, hire a teacher to set up some kind of private school\u2026 If you ask me, he doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s raising prostitutes.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Xiao Chiye downed several cups of wine, showing no sign of being drunk. Beside him, Chen Yang filled Xue Xiuyi\u2019s cup to the brim again. Xiao Chiye casually clinked cups with him and said, \u201cThen why did he buy those batch of people? There has to be a reason.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something odd about Xue Xiuzhuo!\u201d Xue Xiuyi drank several mouthfuls of wine and continued, \u201cIf not for Your Lordship\u2019s reminder, I would not have noticed\u2026 The people he bought are similar in age, but they are all good-looking, with boys and girls both pleasing to the eye. I know there are quite a number of people in the imperial court who are into males. Each of those male prostitutes on Donglong Street is all delicate and supple. They are no less inferior to real, real women! Is he thinking that the ones sold outside are unclean, and that would easily open himself up to gossip and ridicules, so he had to raise a batch on the sly for future connection building?\u201dXiao Chiye did not listen to him prattle on. He toasted him and said, \u201cThen he\u2019s going to have to put in a lot of time and effort. Those popular and known male courtesans on Donglong Street only got to where they are today because of patrons spending cold, hard cash on them. He bought both boys and girls. Is the teacher he hired only teaching the boys?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the odd thing!\u201d Xue Xiuyi\u2019s drunken state was an ungentlemanly sight to behold. He lowered his head for a moment and finally stopped the hiccups before he said to Xiao Chiye, \u201cYour Lordship, he let those girls learn music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.2\u00a0I know why; which man wouldn\u2019t like a pretty lady as a study companion? Yet he let those boys study essays on current affairs.\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s eyes swiftly turned to look at Xue Xiuyi. He repeated, \u201cHe let those boys study essays on current affairs? Just that alone?\u201dXue Xiuyi shook his head hard. He extended his finger and said, \u201cHe set up a small school in that courtyard. Occasionally, he would go there to teach them himself. Your Lordship, do you know what he taught? They were all proper classics. Just the previous day, he was teaching these boys\u2026 contemporary politics!\u201d* * *Xiao Chiye returned home very late. He saw that the room was still lit, and so he knew Shen Zechuan was still waiting for him. Chen Yang dismissed the attendants serving them, leaving only a few of them guards to stand watch over the courtyard.As usual, Xiao Chiye stepped inside. There was only a glazed lamp lit inside. Shen Zechuan was before the small table, looking at the cases. He had already removed his crown, and was draped with Xiao Chiye\u2019s large robe, looking as he always did before he retired for the night.Xiao Chiye leaned over to press down on Shen Zechuan\u2019s back and tilted his head to kiss his earlobe. He said, \u201cLeave a note if something\u2019s the matter. It\u2019s the same discussing it tomorrow morning upon waking up.\u201dShen Zechuan uttered an acknowledgment and turned his head to look at him.Xiao Chiye got up, removed his blade, took out his outer garment, and sat cross-legged beside Shen Zechuan.Shen Zechuan\u2019s fingertips pinched the page of the book, but he did not turn it over. He said, \u201cSome things have to be discussed in person; it can\u2019t be clearly explained in just a word or two.\u201dXiao Chiye finally relaxed and undid his clasps. He said, \u201cLet\u2019s take turns. You first or me first?\u201dShen Zechuan looked at him for a moment, but Xiao Chiye did not pull him closer, so he raised his fingers to help him undo the clasps. After thinking for a moment, he said, \u201cThere are many things I have yet to wrap my head around. You go first.\u201dPropping up his elbow on the small table, Xiao Chiye flipped out another book from the cabinet at the side and handed it to Shen Zechuan. As the latter read it, he said, \u201cOf the batch of people Xue Xiuzhuo bought, the eldest is eighteen years old, and the youngest is fourteen. Boys and girls, both mixing in one courtyard. The only thing they could be said to have in common is that they are all good-looking.\u201d\u201cEight Great Cities. Zhongbo. Juexi.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s fingertip followed the names. \u201cHe didn\u2019t look at their place of origin when he bought them.\u201d\u201cThis might be to obscure the truth so that others would have nowhere to start checking even if they wanted to.\u201d Seeing Shen Zechuan come to a sudden stop at a certain spot, Xiao Chiye moved in closer for a look. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen this name before?\u201dShen Zechuan looked at that name and said, \u201cLing Ting\u2026 I\u2019ve heard this name before at Xiangyun Villa.\u201d\u201cThey are all Xiangyun\u2019s people.\u201d Xiao Chiye said. \u201cShe likes smart and sharp children; that\u2019s why she used \u2018Ling\u2019 as a surname and changed all the names of these fledglings.\u201d\u201cYou had a drink with Xue Xiuyi earlier tonight. Did he say anything?\u201d\u201cHe said something strange.\u201d Xiao Chiye paused for a moment. \u201cHe said Xue Xiuzhuo bought this batch of people back to the residence, where the girls learn all those stuff the brothels teach, while the boys attended proper school. Xue Xiuzhuo hired a teacher for these boys. There\u2019s not only essays on current affairs from the Imperial College but also discourse on contemporary politics.\u201dShen Zechuan pondered it over and said nothing.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cIf he wants students, he could have picked them from decent households. There are plenty of people from the Imperial College who want to formally acknowledge him as their teacher. Yet, it is in such a way to teach the boys he bought back from the brothel. Even if these people really accomplish something in their studies, they still can\u2019t join the ranks of officials due to their lowly status. So what\u2019s in it for him? Unless he intends to raise a bunch of in-residence hangers-on.\u201d3\u201cXue Xiuzhuo\u2026\u201d Shen Zechuan seemed to be drifting away, lost in his thought. He listened to Xiao Chiye\u2019s words and swiftly organized his thoughts. \u201cIf he wants to keep hangers-on, there are better candidates. You and I missed out a point earlier. Xue Xiuzhuo and Xi Hongxuan are on good terms. It\u2019s not like Ouhua Pavilion can\u2019t afford to give him the batch of brothel fledglings he wants, isn\u2019t it? Yet, he specifically used money to buy them from Xiangyun Villa. This shows that he had his sights all along on a certain someone among that batch.\u201dThe images in Shen Zechuan\u2019s mind flashed past. Although he did not have Ding Tao\u2019s photographic memory, he kept every single matter and every single word from his past interactions with the others in his mind to mull over. He remembered them all; he would not forget any details.\u201cAs long as the blood of the Li Clan runs in him, he\u2019s the imperial heir.\u201dGrand Mentor\u2019s Qi words were like a thunderbolt that cleaved apart the current muddle in Shen Zechuan\u2019s mind. Once he thought of this phrase, he thought of many more. He abruptly straightened up in his kneeling pose, and his sleeves flipped over and messed up several pages of papers on the small table.\u201cThe former emperor\u2026\u201d Shen Zechuan grabbed hold of Xiao Chiye\u2019s arm. His voice gradually calmed as he said, \u201cThe former emperor reigned for a little more than eight years. His chronic illness went uncured, and he had no imperial heirs; the only one who got pregnant was Imperial Concubine Wei. During the Nanlin Hunting Grounds incident, the Hua Clan rebelled. Hua Siqian had the guts to make his move that night precisely because of the child in Imperial Concubine Wei\u2019s belly. But after that night, when we returned to the capital, Imperial Concubine Wei was already thrown into a well to drown. At first, I suspected you, but then later on, I suspected it to be a long-time minister from Hai Liangyi\u2019s side. They did it to completely sever the noble clans\u2019 wishful thinking and let Li Jianheng ascend to the throne smoothly. That\u2019s why they struck first to gain the upper hand and killed off Imperial Concubine Wei. But now that I think about it, there\u2019s something wrong with this assumption. Even if Imperial Concubine Wei was with child, there was still no knowing if it was a boy or a girl,4\u00a0so there was no way they could pit the child against Li Jianheng, who already had the support of Libei. To Hai Liangyi, killing Imperial Concubine Wei is an unnecessary move.\u201d\u201cGoing further back, Emperor Guangcheng was on the throne before Emperor Xiande. The Crown Prince of the Eastern Palace slit his own throat in Zhao Zui Temple because of the rebellion case. At that time, the Imperial Grandson was still an infant. If he didn\u2019t die, he should be twenty-six years of age this year. However, this case was jointly handled by Ji Lei and Shen Wei. Ji Lei, in order to defect to Pan Rugui back then and show his loyalty, would surely not dare to be too sloppy and careless. So it\u2019s even more unlikely for him to leave such a big source of disaster behind. In that case, then the one in this world who can still claim to be an imperial heir could only be\u2014\u201dXiao Chiye grasped back Shen Zechuan\u2019s icy cold hand and continued in a deep, lowered voice, \u201cThe eldest is eighteen, and the youngest is fourteen. If it\u2019s truly the imperial heir, then the only one who can match the timeline is Emperor Guangcheng. The Eastern Palace was massacred in the era of Yongyi. For nearly a decade after that, no imperial concubine was able to give birth to an imperial heir right under the Empress Dowager\u2019s watchful eyes. Although Emperor Guangcheng was suffering from an illness at that time, he wasn\u2019t ill to the extent he was weak and frail. Unable to break free from the Hua Clan\u2019s hold over him, he could only think of a way outside the palace.\u201d\u201cOther than me, the only one who knew that Ouhua Pavilion had been hollowed out beneath to be filled with jars was Xue Xiuzhuo. The collapse case was an attempt to kill Li Jianheng, and this is the part I haven\u2019t been able to figure out. Assuming now that he really has an imperial heir in hand, then everything else makes sense. He killed Imperial Concubine Wei, then tried to kill Li Jianheng.\u201d That hidden unease of Shen Zechuan was becoming more and more distinct.Xiao Chiye was also daunted by this out-of-the-blue conjecture. He said, \u201cIf that is truly the case, then the imperial heir is among that batch of people.\u201dBoth men faced each other. Shen Zechuan kept his voice down and said, \u201cThis imperial heir\u2014\u201d\u201cMust not live.\u201d Xiao Chiye pinched Shen Zechuan\u2019s chin and closed the distance between them. His gaze was deep and grave. \u201cLanzhou, we cannot let a single one of these people live.\u201dHe spoke slowly. His intent to kill was like a raging wave buried in these depths. Both of them thought plenty in this very instant. What was the implication of the imperial heir? It implied that everything in the present will all turn passive. Would the noble clan who had the imperial heir in their grasp be easily defeated? Think about the Empress Dowager, who had ruled behind a screen5\u00a0for as long as twenty years. The Li Clan she had in her control could only become her puppet. The power and influence of political factions formed of the aristocratic clans would surely rise again, and Hai Liangyi would once again be beaten back into a disadvantageous position!All of a sudden, the sound of knocking rang out from the other side of the door, breaking the heavy atmosphere between both men.Xiao Chiye said, \u201cSpeak.\u201dQiao Tianya said with slight urgency, \u201cMaster, the man who has been hurrying all night to catch up with Xi Dan is back.\u201dShen Zechuan stood up at once, gathered his clothes together, and opened the door. Qiao Tianya quickly stepped aside to create a path for him. Shen Zechuan looked at Ge Qingqing, who was kneeling on one knee in the courtyard, and went down the steps. He said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cYour Excellency.\u201d Ge Qingqing looked up. His voice was hoarse and shaky. \u201cXi Dan opened the Xi Clan\u2019s money vault, but it has already been emptied out.\u201dThe leaves on the branches in the courtyard rustled in the wind as the trees abruptly inclined their heads to look askance at Ge Qingqing. Moonlight smeared the ground white, as if paving it with a thick blanket of frost. In the dead silence, Shen Zechuan turned his head back a little and said to Xiao Chiye, \u201cEr-lang, we\u2019ve been played for fools by him.\u201dHis tone was soft and gentle, but it made the entire courtyard of guards all lower their heads.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 : Imperial PreceptorThe refreshing breeze came blowing gently, and the chilly night made one cold with fear.Xiao Chiye\u2019s earlier intent to kill was largely dispelled by this \u201cEr-lang\u201d. He stayed silent for a long while, bathed in this pleasant coolness as he calmed himself.Shen Zechuan looked back again at Ge Qingqing. Without looking the least bit flustered, he said, \u201cTransporting this many silvers is not something that can be achieved in a short time. No matter how thorough he is, he can\u2019t deceive the entire world. Gather some men tonight to head out of the city. First, head to Qinzhou and make detailed inquiries along the way. Record down all the business transactions of the major goods in the past two years from Juexi to the Northeast, then send someone to give me a detailed account.\u201dGe Qingqing had been heavyhearted with worries after receiving the news. But when he saw how unperturbed Shen Zechuan was, he could not help but feel a little relieved and composed himself too.\u201cChen Yang.\u201d With his robe hanging off his shoulders, Xiao Chiye motioned, \u201cTake them to the Interpreters Institute1\u00a0in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0first. Get a batch of medium-grade horses and affix their tags to the official writ of arrest for the notorious bandit leader. Say that the bandit is on the run in Juexi. It\u2019s not convenient for the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0to head out of the city to pursue and apprehend him; thus this task is entrusted to the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. I\u2019ll personally make a trip to the Ministry of War and the Ministry of Justice tomorrow morning to submit a report.\u201dThe city gates were already closed, and they could not leave the city arbitrarily. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0were also involved in the important tasks of conducting raids and arrests of criminals, and they usually had to report to the Ministry of Justice and\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0whenever they had to leave the city for fieldwork, then waited for the official approval in reply. By doing this, Xiao Chiye was giving Ge Qingqing a reason to take the men out of the capital and to excuse him from being subsequently called to account by the Ministry of Justice.Ge Qingqing immediately left upon getting his order. Chen Yang threw on his robe and led the way, and both men left the residence ahead of the others.Xiao Chiye led the flimsily-dressed Shen Zechuan back by the hand. When he stepped through the door into the room and saw that Shen Zechuan was still deep in thought, he said, \u201cWhat happened to Teacher is no doubt connected to Xue Xiuzhuo. But since he\u2019s willing to transfer him away, that means Teacher is still of use to him. He won\u2019t act rashly and kill Teacher. There are too many secrets hidden in the Xue\u2019s Residence. I have to think of a reason to get a special search-and-arrest warrant from His Majesty.\u201d\u201cTo deploy the\u00a0Imperial Army, it has to be a major case where the evidence is irrefutable. So we still have to rely on the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0for the probe today.\u201d Shen Zechuan did not sit back in his original seat. He knew that resting would prove to be hard tonight, seeing as it was already late, so he poured himself a cup of strong tea. However, he only took a sip and gave the rest to Xiao Chiye.Xiao Chiye drank it all and said, \u201cXue Xiuzhuo is cautious in everything he does. He would not even accept the \u2018ice respect\u20192\u00a0 those officials outside the city offered him upon their return to the capital. In all the time during his tenure as the Chief Supervising Secretary, the imperial censors from the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0all regarded him as the most uncorrupted official. He rarely gets impeached. So I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll be hard for even the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0to find a reason to investigate him.\u201d\u201cInvestigating him openly with great fanfare will inadvertently alert the enemy.\u201d Shen Zechuan fiddled with the teacup and deliberated it over the bitter aftertaste of the tea. \u201cHe\u2019s out in the open, while we are hidden in the dark. As long as we keep the pawn Xue Xiuyi concealed, we are still the party on the offensive. Matters outside the palace is not an issue, but we have to be even more careful when it comes to affairs within the palace. His intent to kill His Majesty has already been ignited, and he has the help of Mu Ru and Fengquan. He knows every one of His Majesty\u2019s moves and actions like the back of his hand. Under the circumstances, we have no option but to guard against him.\u201dXiao Chiye thought for a moment, then said, \u201cDidn\u2019t Fengquan just become the Seal-holding Director of the\u00a0Directorate of Ceremonial? Given his service record, he will surely incur censure from both inner and outer courts. Fuman, whose rank is beneath him, is itching for a fight, while Hai Liangyi detests eunuchs. Fengquan\u2019s power and authority now that he has assumed the post of the Seal-holding Director cannot be compared to Pan Rugui\u2019s during the latter\u2019s time in power. Get him trapped both on the inside and outside where he is unable to fend for himself, and he won\u2019t have the spare capacity to deal with anything else for Xue Xiuzhuo.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also of pivotal importance to secure His Majesty\u2019s position.\u201d Shen Zechuan said. \u201cNo word regarding the imperial heir must get out.\u201dEver since Li Jianheng\u2019s ascension, he had been castigated much by the imperial censors. What\u2019s more, he had met with mishaps and dangers one after another. He did not have an outstanding track record of political achievements, and his reputation among the commoners was not comparable to that of the former emperor. If the matter of the imperial heir were to leak, it would no doubt unsettle public sentiment. No matter which way one were to look at it, it would not be conducive to maintaining stability.\u201cRegardless of whether it\u2019s a real dragon or a fake dragon3\u00a0in Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s hands.\u201d Xiao Chiye pressed against his thumb ring and stared at the glazed lamp. \u201cThe emperor of Dazhou can only be Li Jianheng. Even if a crown prince is to be designated in the future, it can only be Li Jianheng\u2019s son.\u201dThe Xiao Clan was now a notch above the Hua Clan, and they had managed to preserve their power. Xiao Chiye, secured in his position, was steadily making his moves, while Xiao Jiming, over in Libei, was solid in his defenses too. They pitted against the noble clans in Zhongbo and Qidong on the sly. The fight was not that intense, because there were the outspoken ministers Hai Liangyi and his people to act as an intermediary and mediate between them, managing with some difficulty to prevent the infighting between the two tigers4\u00a0from deteriorating further. But then, Hai Liangyi\u2019s greatest protection was Li Jianheng. Li Jianheng was willing to trust him and respect him; he knew of his unyielding loyalty. That\u2019s why he had not immediately turned to the Empress Dowager for support in this tug-of-war. Furthermore, Li Jianheng was willing to lay out all the major and minor affairs of the imperial court on the table to discuss with Hai Liangyi. This was the fundamental reason why Hai Liangyi could secure his position in the Grand Secretariat as the Grand Secretary after the move into the new reign.The person Li Jianheng was not important. But after he ascended to the throne, \u201cLi Jianheng\u201d became crucial. He was in the center of all the covert and overt attacks. And he was the cage the three sides jointly used to restrain the other. He was also the dagger the three sides jointly used to attack the other.Now that Xue Xiuzhuo had already surfaced, Shen Zechuan could not help but wonder \u2013 even as he looked for a breakthrough \u2013 if there was another person behind Xue Xiuzhuo.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8There was a drizzle a few days later, when Xue Xiuzhuo had the day off.He was wearing a sky blue fine-woven silk robe as he paid a formal call on Qi Huilian at the small building he was jn. Qi Huilian took large bites of his meal and did not even cast a glance at him.Xue Xiuzhuo did not sit at the table, and the bow he made was a protocol observed by pupils. He saw Ji Gang sitting before the window polishing a stone, and so he said to those in attendance, \u201cElder Ji has yet to recover from his injuries and should avoid spicy food. Go and get the chef from Duanzhou to cook up the dishes again.\u201d\u201cNo need for the trouble.\u201d Ji Gang blew away the dust and said in a quiet voice, \u201cI\u2019m not eating.\u201dXue Xiuzhuo did not say a word, and the attendant withdrew to give the chef his instructions. The Xue Clan was a prominent clan of the City of Jincheng, and they were not used to the local tastes of Zhongbo. This chef from Duanzhou was someone he had hired specifically for Ji Gang.The drizzle outside the building came pitter-pattering amongst the apricot blooms in spring, and the pink and white in the courtyard were all beaten to mud by the rain. Having eaten and drunk to his fill, Qi Huilian wiped his mouth and rose to look at the bleak scene in the courtyard. He said, \u201cNo need to waste that effort. Ji Gang is extremely obstinate. If he says he\u2019s not eating, then it means exactly that. Just get them to prepare some steamed buns and pickled vegetables for him to allay his hunger.\u201dXue Xiuzhuo smiled, \u201cI can\u2019t be so irreverent with both elders in my house as guests.\u201d\u201cThen open the doors.\u201d Ji Gang carved a nose and eyes for the stone. \u201cWe can go back ourselves.\u201dWithout a change in his expression, Xue Xiuzhuo said, \u201cThere\u2019s a chill in the spring air lately. Seeing as Vice Commander Shen still has nowhere to settle down, how would he be able to provide proper accommodation for both elders?\u201d\u201cDrop the pretense. Just say that you\u2019re keeping us in captivity.\u201d Qi Huilian walked a few steps, and the iron chain on his ankles clanked along with his movements. He said, \u201cI\u2019ve been taken prisoner my entire life, and I\u2019m almost reaching my end. I\u2019m old, and he\u2019s disabled. What are you trying to do by holding the two of us old, weak, sick, and disabled men captive in your hands?\u201dXue Xiuzhuo personally bent over to pick up the chopsticks Qi Huilian had pushed aside to the ground. Wiping it with a handkerchief, he said, \u201cMister is a brilliant man of great stature in the past. You originally would have enjoyed the posthumous honor and glory of being enshrined and worshiped by the Imperial Ancestral Temple after death. A pity you threw in your lot with the wrong person, and ended up feigning insanity in Zhao Zui Temple for twenty years. Today, I would like to ask of Mister to be the Imperial Preceptor once again. Firstly, it can make up for Mister\u2019s regret for not being able to witness the Crown Prince\u2019s enthronement ceremony back then. Secondly, it can redress the injustice and grievance Mister has suffered and allow Mister to begin afresh in the imperial court; you can return before the eyes of the masses in a dignified and aboveboard manner. Aren\u2019t these two reasons sufficient enough? I am a person who respects and admires Mister.\u201d\u201cBe the Imperial Preceptor again.\u201d Qi Huilian took a step backward, dragging the iron chain along with him. A laugh escaped his throat. \u201cYou want me to be the Imperial Preceptor again? Such arrogance! The world is now at peace, and the current emperor is rightfully legitimate. He has that Hai Renshi to watch over him and assist him, so why do you still need me, Qi Huilian? I\u2019m crazy and silly. There\u2019s no way I can assume an important post!\u201dXue Xiuzhuo set down the chopsticks and said, \u201cMister ended in such a situation only because Mister was slandered. During the reign of Yongyi, the Empress Dowager took control over the state affairs, which turned the law and discipline of Dazhou\u2019s imperial court upside down and caused corrupt officials to run amok. It was the same during the reign of Xiande. Hua and Pan colluded with one another and stirred up troubles in\u00a0Qudu, the Eight Cities, the entire Dazhou, bringing untold suffering to the common folk of the various lands. Then, the troops of Zhongbo suffered a defeat, and it was a scene of desolation and despair in the Six Prefectures as victims and refugees swarmed all over, and bodies of the starved littered the roads. Mister spent an idle twenty years in Zhao Zui Temple, yet you have lost your drive and heroic spirit now that you have come out. Have you even lost the will to compete and emerge victorious against Hai Liangyi?\u201dQi Huilian turned around and held on to the window to look at the rain pelting the apricot blossoms. After a moment of silence, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s true that I wanted to compete with Hai Liangyi twenty-five years ago to determine who was the better one. We both took the same imperial examinations. He was so unremarkable, while I ranked first in the imperial civil examinations at the provincial, metropolitan, and palace level.5\u00a0I was complacent in my youth and did not know how to navigate the official circles. I ended up framed and demoted out of the capital. Too ashamed to face my elders in Yuzhou, I fell depressed for several years. Later on, Hai Liangyi was promoted, and he rose in ranks. Yet, the Crown Prince did not take him as his teacher, but welcomed me back to\u00a0Qudu\u00a0from Yuzhou. And so, I became the Grand Mentor of the Eastern Palace. At the same time, I assumed the post of Minister of Personnel. Hai Liangyi lost to the name Qi Huilian his entire life. But he is a gentleman. When the Crown Prince slit his own throat, he was condemned by all. Only Hai Liangyi believed that there was still hope in him\u2014that he was not beyond redemption. Just for this alone, I cannot be compared to him. Between us, there is no superiority or inferiority, only mutual appreciation. But alas, Heaven is blind. Even though we share the same path, we still cannot work together. I\u2019ve been trapped for twenty-five years. You\u2019re right. At present, I no longer have the will nor desire to compete with him.\u201dXue Xiuzhuo fell silent too, leaving only the sound of rain and of Ji Gang carving and polishing in the room. The rain intensified, and the apricot blossoms fell in an even more chaotic manner to form a blanket of fragmentary pink among the muddy water.\u201cIn this lifetime, I\u2019ve only taught two people, and both times, I imparted all the knowledge I have learned over the course of my life to them. I thought too highly of my talents and was unwilling to make do, and it was precisely of this conceitedness that I caused such great harm to my first student.\u201d Qi Huilian gazed at that dirty water with pieces of petals, as if he was looking at his own down-and-out half of his life. He said, \u201cI, Qi Huilian, am not an immortal after all. Two students are enough. As for the others, I\u2019m not up to teaching them.\u201dJi Gang burst out coughing violently. He covered his mouth with a handkerchief and grumbled, \u201cClose the windows!\u201dQi Huilian shut all those scenes outside and looked back at Xue Xiuzhuo. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s all I have to say. Don\u2019t pester me! Leave. Don\u2019t stay and get in the way.\u201dXue Xiuzhuo did not move. His appearance did not resemble Xue Xiuyi; he did not even look to be a noble clan\u2019s descendant. He lacked the same kind of haughtiness Pan Li and Fei Shi had. His identity as a son born of a concubine had given him a lot of grief the past decades, and it subsequently polished him into a person of unobtrusive but sophisticated elegance.\u201cI admire Mister\u2019s talents and learning, and I look up even more to Mister\u2019s philosophy on the world. I have come thrice to this small building to beseech Mister to come out of obscurity to return to officialdom all because I understand Mister\u2019s aspirations. Mister, Hai Liangyi is indeed a lofty gentleman, but a gentleman has never been able to co-exist for long with a man with petty interests. The current emperor is not given to accepting guidance from the classics, and he doesn\u2019t have the benevolence to treat worthy men and men of virtue with due respect. He is merely a straw everyone grasps on to as Dazhou teethers on the brink of collapse. There is no way he can be a wise and virtuous ruler. How much strength and energy does Hai Liangyi still have left in him? To entrust the safety of the state entirely on him alone is a complete reversal of hierarchy and an overlook of the more important issues at hand.\u201dQi Huilian said, \u201cTo begin with, it\u2019s the ministers\u2019 duty to assist the sovereign in governing the state. Hai Liangyi is doing his best to save the situation from declining and to mediate between the various parties. He\u2019s a loyal subject. Don\u2019t tell me you still want him to be a traitor, one who replaces the Li Clan and brings about a regime change?\u201d\u201cThe conflict between those from the noble clans and those of humble backgrounds has been going on for hundreds of years. To get rid of this age-old societal ill, one must have the determination to commit oneself irrevocably and fight to the very end.\u201d Xue Xiuzhuo rose to his feet and said, \u201cIf Li Jianheng can\u2019t do it, there are still others. Dazhou is the empire of the Li Clan. As long as the Li bloodline still exists, then it\u2019s only reasonable to have a change in person in order to tide over this crisis.\u201dQi Huilian\u2019s point of view was at odds with him. So he merely treated him as a noble clan descendant abusing his power for personal gains and refused to engage further in a conversation with him.Xue Xiuzhuo stood in silence for a moment before he said, \u201cMister and I are also both kindred spirits on the same path. It\u2019s a pity Mister doesn\u2019t believe me. But I still have to tell you that Shen Zechuan is a vestige of evil who drags out his feeble existence nursing his hatred. There is nothing else in his heart; he merely exists for revenge. He acts with viciousness, and he is narrow-minded. He is poles apart from the Crown Prince. Mister teaches him with the heart and mind of tutoring a sovereign, and this is no different from helping a villain commit evil. Even if he makes great achievements in the future, he still won\u2019t be a good master.\u201dJi Gang slammed down his carving knife without warning and glared furiously at Xue Xiuzhuo. He said, \u201cHow much do you understand Chuan-er? You people keep calling him a vestige of evil, but the way I see it, all of you are the insatiably greedy vestiges of evil! Shut your trap and leave!\u201dXue Xiuzhuo bowed and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting, should Mister have second thoughts.\u201dHe exited and left after letting down the curtain.Xue Xiuyi was wandering outside the courtyard when he saw Xue Xiuzhuo walking back from afar. He cradled the umbrella close and made his way to the veranda, only to bump into the students who had been dismissed from school.These students, who came from the brothel, paid their respects to him. Xue Xiuyi tossed the umbrella to the maidservant behind him and looked at them one at a time. The maidservant said, \u201cIs this the path for you people to walk on? How impertinent of you all to get in the way of the Eldest Master!\u201dThe students hung their heads down and retreated. A girl of seventeen or eighteen stood behind them. Xiu Xiuyi noted that she was extraordinarily good-looking, so he tugged her sleeve frivolously and said, \u201cAre you one of the chicks Yanqing bought back? What\u2019s your name?\u201dThis girl cast a glance at Xue Xiuyi without answering. Xue Xiuzhuo just happened to approach from the other end to block Xue Xiuyi. He said with a smile, \u201cDid Eldest Brother just come back? Let\u2019s return to the courtyard. The rain is heavy. Careful not to get drenched.\u201dXue Xiuyi slapped his hand away and said impatiently, \u201cI know!\u201dXue Xiuyi took a few steps and heard the students behind him pay their respects in unison and addressed Xue Xiuzhuo \u201cTeacher\u201d. He turned his head back again for another look, only to see that girl earlier looking right back at him with her head inclined to the side.Her gaze showed no fear or trepidation. Even after Xiu Xiuyi discovered her looking at him, she did not avert her gaze. Instead, she looked at him until Xue Xiuyi could not help but turn his head around first.The wind and the rain pelted his face. Xue Xiuyi shivered and hurried away with his arms wrapped around himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 : ThunderGe Qingqing had been out of the capital for a little less than half a month. The Xi Clan\u2019s money vaults that were opened one after another all turned up empty, but the good thing was that the stores in the various regions could be managed by Xi Dan. Coupled with the four million silvers he had gotten earlier, Shen Zechuan did not end up totally empty-handed with nothing to show for.The two million that had been transported via the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path in the fourth month had already arrived at Cizhou. When the letter was delivered back to\u00a0Qudu, it was directly handed over to Shen Zechuan right from Ding Tao\u2019s hands.Shen Zechuan wiped his sweat. Before he opened it, he waved to Xiao Chiye, who was similarly drenched in sweat. Xiao Chiye took off his clothes and went inside to take a bath. He said from the other side of the screen, \u201cJust read it out to me.\u201dShen Zechuan read out the letter. Xiao Jiming had been brief and concise in his message, which was that the silver had arrived in Cizhou without a hitch, and the army provisions for Libei\u2019s Armored Cavalry this summer and autumn had also arrived at the warehouse.\u201cJiang Qingshan was transferred to Zhongbo to take up the post of the Provincial Administration Commissioner of Zhongbo. Then was this batch of army provisions prepared by someone else?\u201dXiao Chiye took a quick bath. As he wiped himself, he said, \u201cIt was jointly prepared by the Assistant Administration Commissioner of Juexi, Yang Cheng, and the subordinated Vice Prefects along with the various Juexi Vice Magistrates. They are all old hands under Jiang Qingshan\u2019s command, and they are the fastest when it comes to the past preparation of the military provisions.\u201dShen Zechuan set down the letter on the desk. He wanted to say that since it had not been through Jiang Qingshan\u2019s inspection, then the military provisions should still be properly inspected before distribution. But he thought the better of it when it came to his mind that Xiao Chiye was not managing Libei\u2019s military affairs. Xiao Jiming should know the ins and outs of this matter; there was no need for an outsider like him to interfere, so he dropped it and did not bring it up again.Xiao Chiye draped on a dark-colored wide-sleeved robe over his inner garment. He could hold his own against these solemn colors. Even with it hanging loosely over his shoulders, he cut an imposing figure. He drank a cup of tea that had gone cold when he came out and said, \u201cGu Jin went to the Xue Residence to check it up last night. Teacher and\u00a0Shifu\u00a0are most likely detained in one of the lofts.\u201d\u201cCommon places aren\u2019t able to trap\u00a0shifu.\u201d Shen Zechuan touched the brush. \u201cI want to see it for myself.\u201d\u201cIf someone as vigilant and wary as him were to discover it and transfer Teacher and\u00a0Shifu\u00a0to another place, then we will be looking for a needle in a haystack.\u201d Xiao Chiye removed the crown for Shen Zechuan. \u201cI\u2019ve already called for men to take turns to keep the periphery of the Xue\u2019s Residence under surveillance. We have to think of a safer method.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still one thing I can\u2019t figure out.\u201d Shen Zechuan let Xiao Chiye comb his hair for him. That clumsy back and forth was not at all like the Second Young Master. \u201cHow exactly did he empty out the Xi Clan\u2019s money vaults? Ge Qingqing did not find out anything in Qinzhou either.\u201dXiao Chiye cast a glance at Shen Zechuan in the mirror and said, \u201cCan\u2019t figure it out? I already did.\u201dShen Zechuan looked at him.\u201cWe know that four million silvers you got are all subjected to inspections at the various regions\u2019 checkpoints as long as they are transported through a trade route, regardless of whether it was by land or water. He must have this concern too, so there\u2019s no point checking the trade routes.\u201d Even as Xiao Chiye spoke, his hands did not remain idle. He weaved a little braid the width of a finger for Shen Zechuan and slowly continued, \u201cThe governmental posts Xue Xiuzhuo holds in successive order are all important positions. A Chief Supervising Secretary audits the accounts in the various regions, and when it\u2019s close to the Banquet of A Hundred Officials, he no doubt has to have dealings with the Transport Office. The Transport Office is responsible for the management of the local taxes paid out to the imperial court. It can\u2019t get any more convenient for him to enter and exit\u00a0Qudu\u00a0if he smuggles the silvers in between.\u201dSuddenly enlightened, Shen Zechuan asked again, \u201cThen where did he hide them? Although the Xue\u2019s Residence is larger in scale than the Xi\u2019s Residence, it\u2019s not of a real heritage as the Yao Clan. Even if he dug into the ground, he can\u2019t hide that much money.\u201d\u201cThat depends on how exactly he wants to use them.\u201d Xiao Chiye released his fingers, and Shen Zechuan\u2019s black hair cascaded down like water. It was soft to the touch, and totally lacking in aggressiveness. He pressed down on Shen Zechuan\u2019s shoulders from the back, and both men appeared in the mirror. He said, \u201cHis hometown is in the City of Jincheng, and down south is the Prefecture of Hezhou. Hezhou\u2019s waterways are developed and are dominated by the Yan Clan, who have business dealings with the Xi Clan\u2019s boats in the harbors of Juexi. Now that he has kicked off Xi Hongxuan, he will have to find someone who can play around with money as well as Xi Hongxuan if he wants this money to start moving once more. And this person is none other than the Yan Clan of Hezhou. So, my guess is that he most likely entrusted these silvers to the Yan Clan of Hezhou.\u201dShen Zechuan had never been to Hezhou before. All he knew was that the Yan Clan of Hezhou was very capable. They were not like the Xi Clan where legitimate sons born of the principal wife ruled the roost. What they counted on was capability, regardless of whether one was a son of lawful birth born of the principal wife or a son of common birth born of concubines. During the first year in the reign of Xiande, the Yan Clan made a fortune trading in tea in Hezhou. They rarely went near\u00a0Qudu\u00a0other than to pay tributes. Shen Zechuan knew very little of them.\u201cSecond Young Master\u2019s braids are all so prettily done.\u201d Even as Shen Zechuan was thinking, he did not forget to look askance and poke fun at him, \u201cTruly an erudite man of many talents.\u201d\u201cThis Second Young Master has braided many a number of them.\u201d Xiao Chiye teased him. \u201cAren\u2019t\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin\u2019s little braids pretty? I was the one who braided them all.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cI put all my heart and soul into saving up the betrothal gift for you. Yet you regard me as\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin?\u201dXiao Chiye lowered his body and jested to the mirror, \u201cA horse, hm.\u201dThere were all sorts of expressions in Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes. Pressing against Shen Zechuan like this made Shen Zechuan remember the debauchery of the last time they rode the horse on a rainy night. His smooth neck no longer had those love bites, yet it had already learned to blush when Xiao Chiye whispered into his ears.Shen Zechuan lifted his chin slightly, completely exposing the arc of that exquisite, jade-like neck. It was like a crescent moon in the dim light; not that sharp, and innately smooth and lustrous. He softly asked, \u201cAm I?\u201dXiao Chiye fell under his spell. He kissed the corner of Shen Zechuan\u2019s eye, then stared at the man in the mirror and said with a smile, \u201cWould I bear to? You\u2019re the master of me. I only want to take you riding.\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s anxiety that had persisted for days on end dispersed some. When he smiled, it carried with it a hint of seductive allure that even he himself did not notice.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8The temperature in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0suddenly rose in the fifth month. They had not even enjoyed the refreshing coolness of spring to their hearts\u2019 content when that summer heat came assaulting them in the faces. The subordinate officials could not take sedans as they went about their tasks, so each of them lifted their robes and fanned themselves. They were drenched in sweat as they entered and exited the various office compounds, with the blazing sun already causing their lips to peel and faces to redden.Liang Cuishan had only gotten some free time after receiving a succession of promotions owing to his audits of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s accounts. He was now working under Pan Lin, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, handling the task of auditing the various regions\u2019 taxes.Pan Lin was now overwhelmed with gratitude towards Xiao Chiye. This was because not two days after he returned home the last time, Li Jianheng really granted his father, Pan Xiangjie, a pardon for his offense. He was not banished to the frontier; instead, he only received a salary suspension pending observation and was excluded from this year\u2019s inspection.Xiao Chiye had never recommended and vouched for Liang Cuishan for promotion in public, but they were all astute people who knew that Liang Cuishan was someone Xiao Chiye had recommended before the emperor. So even though Xiao Chiye did not give any prior notification, Pan Lin still took good care of Liang Cuishan, sparing him from Wei Huaigu\u2019s reproach.\u201cIt\u2019s the grand wedding of Hua and Qi next month. We have to familiarize ourselves with the processes the Ministry of Rites sent over, and the various expenses all have to be clearly calculated in case we can\u2019t give a flawless answer when the Empress Dowager asks about it after the wedding banquet.\u201d Pan Lin drank the green bean soup. He was so hot that his back was thoroughly soaked.Pan Lin was much younger than Liang Cuishan. But he joined the imperial court earlier, and his rank was high, so even if Liang Cuishan did not address himself as \u201cthis humble subordinate\u201d before him, he had to address himself as \u201cthis pupil\u201d.Liang Cuishan was feeling hot too. But they were in the office compound, and they had to pay attention to officials\u2019 etiquettes, so he could not strip off his robe as he liked; otherwise, he would be chastised if he were to encounter the imperial censors from the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau. He dabbed his forehead with a handkerchief and said with a nod, \u201cThis humble subordinate shall heed Your Excellency\u2019s instructions. I will not dare to forget a single amount in this account.\u201dPan Lin gave him a few more instructions on the other matters. He still had to go to the Ministry of Rites to verify some details, so he stepped out to get on the sedan and left.Having owed a debt of gratitude to Shen Zechuan and Xiao Chiye for their recognition and appreciation of his worth, Liang Cuishan never dared to be shoddy in his work and so promptly set about reconciling the accounts. He sat for only a moment when he heard someone outside barging in.It was midday at present, and there were not many people around. Liang Cuishan hurriedly went down the steps to greet the person. Seeing as this person was an unfamiliar face, he asked, \u201cBrother, who are you looking for?\u201dThis person was sweating profusely as he shoved an entire document to Liang Cuishan. He said, \u201cThis humble subordinate is an official from the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path Postal Relay Station! Your Excellency, this is an urgent report dispatched from Juexi\u2019s Prefecture of Baimazhou the night before. It comes with the authentication tally from the Provincial Administration Commission of Juexi. This is a matter of extreme urgency!\u201dNortheast Provisions Bridle Path!The moment Liang Cuishan heard this name, he knew it was a major matter which concerned Libei. He accepted the stuff and said in an urgent voice, \u201cWhy deliver it to the Ministry of Revenue? All the matters from Libei are considered military reports and should be delivered to the Ministry of War!\u201d\u201cThis is an urgent report dispatched from Baimazhou.\u201d This person said. \u201cIt bears the tag of the Ministry of Revenue! Your Excellency, please present it to the Minister\u2019s desk quickly. The consequence of delaying this express relay report is not something you and I can bear!\u201dLiang Cuishan promptly headed inside with the document under his arm and hurried over to the place, only to turn up empty. But while he did not see Wei Huaigu, he saw Wei Huaigu\u2019s attendant. The attendant accepted the stuff, but took his time and told Liang Cuishan to go back first, saying that there would be arrangements made for it later.Liang Cuishan intuitively sensed a problem. How could an express relay report be handled so flippantly? They were clearly stalling for time! His heart pounded hard as he retreated out. But instead of returning to the office compound, he turned around, lifted his robe, and ran to where the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0were on duty.It was scorching hot all the way there. Liang Cuishan was panting hard when he arrived. Without even daring to drink a mouthful of water, he hurried into the courtyard and requested to see Shen Zechuan.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Qiao Tianya led him in. \u201cWhy did Your Excellency run all the way here?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an urgent matter!\u201d Liang Cuishan could hardly care to explain to Qiao Tianya. When he saw Shen Zechuan upon entering, he hurriedly said, \u201cYour Excellency! This humble subordinate has something to discuss with you!\u201dShen Zechuan got Qiao Tianya to serve the tea. Setting aside his official affairs, he said with a fixed gaze, What\u2019s wrong?\u201dLiang Cuishan did not dare to sit. He exerted himself to take a breather and said, \u201cThis humble subordinate received an express relay report dispatched from Juexi\u2019s Prefecture of Baimazhou earlier at the Ministry of Revenue\u2019s office compound earlier. It concerns the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path! This humble subordinate delivered the report to the top, but never got to meet His Excellency the Minister. This stuff is inextricably connected to Libei. Your Excellency, I fear something has happened to the military provisions sent to Libei last month!\u201dShen Zechuan immediately rose and said, \u201cHead over to the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s office compound and inform His Lordship of this matter! Take my horse. Say that the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0is on official duty and spur the horse all the way there!\u201dThe military provisions concerned Libei\u2019s war affairs this year. If Wei Huaigu was indeed delaying reporting this to the higher-ups, then there must have been a slip-up somewhere that he alone could not shoulder the responsibility for. Although the preparation for the military provisions was handled by the Prefecture of Baimazhou in Juexi, the overall inspection had been carried out by the Ministry of Revenue.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8This sweltering heat was abnormal. It was only the beginning of the fifth month, yet it felt just like the Great Heat.1\u00a0The sun was still scorching at midday, and by the afternoon, the weather had turned overcast and windy, looking as if a rainstorm was fast approaching.Wei Huaigu had sat on the chair for an entire hour. His back was already soaked through. He felt dizzy, having already finished reading that postal relay report much earlier. Several times, he wanted to speak, but he could not bring himself to say a word. Eventually, he steeled himself, abruptly rose to his feet, and said, \u201cPrepare the sedan! We\u2019re going into the palace!\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xiao Chiye had not even dismounted yet, and the bean-sized raindrops had already come pelting down. Meng stopped on his shoulder. Just as he was about to enter the city, he saw Qiao Tianya galloping towards him.Qiao Tianya had not reached him when Ding Tao also came spurring his horse over from the other end. He tumbled off the horse\u2019s back and said in a quivering voice, \u201cYour Lordship! Something bad has happened! We received a military report earlier, which says that the Hanshe Tribe had trespassed into our territory the day before yesterday and encountered the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0on the eastern mountain range. The\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u2014\u201dDing Tao\u2019s tearful voice rose.\u201cThe\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0is severely wounded. We\u2019ve been defeated!\u201dQiao Tianya abruptly reined in his horse. Sudden thunder detonated in the sky, blasting apart the darkness cast by the billows of gloomy clouds. Rainwater came pouring down in torrents. Xiao Chiye was still on his horse. For the first time, he had on a dazed expression, as if he did not understand what Ding Tao meant.In nearly thirty years since Xiao Fangxu established the Libei Armored Cavalry, Libei had never suffered a defeat. Even when Xiao Jiming led his troops of light cavalry2\u00a0to pursue and attack the Hanshe Tribe for several hundred\u00a0li3\u00a0in the past, he had been able to retreat from the desert unharmed.Xiao Chiye had never thought that his eldest brother would be defeated.Never.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 : Veteran GeneralHeavy rain splashed on the water puddles. Xiao Chiye\u2019s horse had already dashed its way to the palace entrance. Red silk umbrellas emerged one after the other from the small sedans, all of them sheltering important ministers of third-grade and above.The Minister of War, Chen Zhen, made a special point of being a tad late to wait for Xiao Chiye at the foot of the vermilion steps leading up to the palace hall. When he saw Xiao Chiye coming forth in the rain, he said, \u201cCe\u2019an, listen to me. There is no army in this world that is invincible. A defeat is a teacher that will guide one towards another victory. Jiming has been fighting with the Biansha\u2019s Hanshe Tribe for years. He\u2019s also human.\u201dChen Zhen, who had some friendly relations with Xiao Fangxu, spoke abruptly without preamble. Yet, Xiao Chiye understood what he meant.Xiao Chiye nodded at him with an expressionless face. He ascended the stairs together with Chen Zhen and proceeded to wait outside Mingli Hall to be summoned in. The rain soaked his shoulders, and it was in this way he stood there, shunning even the faintest of light from the lanterns.The umbrella at the back suddenly shifted to shield Xiao Chiye. Shen Zechuan held up the umbrella and stood side by side with him. Standing next to each other with both of their red robes drenched by the rain made them look like demonic fiends of the rainy night.About a moment later, Fuman lifted the curtain and paid his obeisances to the group of court officials outside and called out to summon them in. Hai Liangyi went in first, followed by the various ministers from the Grand Secretariat. Then it was Xiao Chiye\u2019s turn. Even Shen Zechuan himself could not follow him in.Xiao Chiye did not move. He remained fixed in position for a spell and looked at Shen Zechuan. There were too many subliminal emotions contained in this gaze. In this very instant, he turned from a valiant and vicious hound into a lone wolf that had strayed from the pack.Shen Zechuan wanted to caress Xiao Chiye\u2019s cheeks. But he could not do so at this moment. They stood still for a long time under the shadows of this forbidden palace\u2019s walls, wearing shackles invisible to the eyes.Xiao Jiming was severely wounded, and there were no other valiant generals within Libei\u2019s borders. This was an indication that after tonight,\u00a0Qudu\u00a0must appoint a new general to Libei to take over the mantle from Xiao Jiming. But this person would not be Xiao Chiye.Qi Zhuyin\u2019s remarks a year earlier turned out to be prophetic. She warned Xiao Jiming that the Libei Armored Cavalry needed a new general. Owing to the excessive concentration of military power, the Libei Armored Cavalry could only take after the surname Xiao. Once the banner of the Xiao Clan fell, the constitution of the Libei Armored Cavalry would be greatly undermined, making it hard to sustain their glory.The Grandson-heir, Xiao Xun, was only six years of age. If Xiao Jiming was out of the picture, then the Libei Armored Cavalry\u2019s only successor was Xiao Chiye, who was in\u00a0Qudu. However,\u00a0Qudu\u00a0would never release him, not unless the Princess Consort of the\u00a0Hereditary Prince, Lu Yizhi, entered the capital with Grandson-heir, Xiao Xun, to replace him as hostages in this power struggle.In acting willfully, Xiao Chiye had been merely counting on his powerful connections, much like a fox exploiting the tiger\u2019s might. But at this moment, he once again plunged into a ravine where he could not act on his own volition. The thought of going home roared like mad in his heart. But all he could do was to gaze like this at Shen Zechuan. Other than Shen Zechuan, no one else would understand.\u201cYour Lordship?\u201d Fuman urged him on in a whisper.Xiao Chiye moved his feet and entered.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u201cThe Ministry of Revenue assigned officials over for a check before the military provisions were escorted via the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path. Since there was a problem, why didn\u2019t the Ministry of Revenue report it?\u201d Cen Yu was the first to take issue with it. He did not even have time to write the memorial and simply stepped forth to interrogate Wei Huaigu outright. \u201cWhen the express relay report arrived at\u00a0Qudu, it was delayed for an entire two hours! If we issue the recall order now, we have to brave the rain to speed all the way there on a route that isn\u2019t easy to navigate. By the time it arrives at Libei, it would have already been four days later! Wei Huaigu, you\u2019re going to get people killed!\u201dWei Huaigu said nothing. He was just like a statue tonight as he kneeled on the ground in a daze without even disputing a word.The moment Xiao Chiye entered, the hall fell silent. The veteran ministers either hung their heads low or held their foreheads. The sound of the rain outside was noisy, but the suffocating heat inside was even worse.\u201cCe\u2019an.\u201d Li Jianheng made as if to speak when he saw him, but then he hesitated. Eventually, he merely said, \u201cTake a seat.\u201dXiao Chiye did not sit. He bowed and said, \u201cThis humble subject has only just dismounted and does not know the details. What happened in Libei?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell? Such a major matter, and nobody told the Marquis!\u201d Li Jianheng flung the memorial. \u201cWei Huaigu, you tell him yourself!\u201dWei Huaigu lowered his head and said without looking at Xiao Chiye, \u201cSomething went wrong with the military provisions that were transported to Libei last month. According to the relay report of Yang Cheng, the Assistant Administration Commissioner of Juexi Provincial Administration Commission, these military provisions have been mixed with moldy substances. It was distributed after arriving at Libei, and subsequently, thousands of people fell ill the night before.\u201dWho would still dare to look at Xiao Chiye in the eye?The Xiao Clan fought wars at the frontier. And they had performed a tremendous meritorious service five years ago in coming to the emperor\u2019s rescue. The Biansha Hanshe Tribe was the toughest of the lot to battle against, and the entire northeast area was guarded and defended by Xiao Jiming alone. They imprisoned the Xiao Clan\u2019s youngest son in\u00a0Qudu, and yet they let his battle-scarred eldest brother, who fought hard with his sweat and blood, eat moldy and rotten grains! So how would they still dare to look Xiao Chiye in the eyes at this time?Without turning a hair, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cThe military provisions were prepared by the Provincial Administration Commission of Juexi. Yang Cheng knew there was a problem. Why did he wait until the military provisions arrived at Libei before he dared to mention it? He\u2019s the Assistant Administration Commissioner of the Southwest, and he has no grudge or enmity with Libei. Why would he risk his head to do something like this? The officials from the Ministry of Revenue triple-checked the military provisions, and the official reports that were sent back all stated that they were new grains from last year. But now, they have all become old and moldy grains. They are all minor officials of low grade. Why would they do that? The military provisions arrived at Libei via the Northeast Provisions Bridle Path, and the Libei Armored Cavalry steward supervising the granary also had to check before distributing them. The multiple layers of arrangements involved for such a large batch of moldy goods to make its way into the mouths of the officers and soldiers at the frontier pass this easily can only be described as methodical.\u201dThe more he spoke, the more his words increased in gravity.\u201cThe Libei Armored Cavalry has guarded the pass for thirty years, and the troops deserve punishment for their defeat. But I\u2019ll only say one thing to everyone present here. A minor defeat of Libei is a loss for our Xiao Clan, but a major defeat of Libei is a crisis for Dazhou. For several years, the Hanshe Tribe has been pacing back and forth around the Hongyan eastern mountain range. What they are waiting for is an opportunity. When the troops of Zhongbo were defeated, the Hanshe Tribe deployed their horses to launch an assault. They brought the cavalry of the rest of the eleven tribes and fought their way right outside the gates of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0without any letup. It has just been a mere five years, and the page has already been turned on the tragic massacre of the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo. We have yet to avenge our national humiliation, and we are going to allow our own people to add another strike to it?\u201dThe moment Xiao Chiye said his piece, the color drained from the faces of everyone present. He was blunt in his words. He had come here tonight to raise hell and take someone to task for this matter. Someone played dirty tricks on the military provisions, and they want to dismiss him with that same old trick of bureaucratese? No way. He\u00a0would\u00a0go all out on a killing spree, and he\u00a0would\u00a0pursue this case relentlessly. Everything else be damn; he wasn\u2019t going to play nice with any of them!\u201cThe military provisions were adulterated, with new grains substituted with moldy ones. It\u2019s no doubt inextricably connected to those at the bottom of the supply chain who resell the grains at a profit. A few years earlier, Zhongbo was in short supply of grains, and many merchants who stockpiled the grains made a killing from this. It\u2019s just that I never expected there to be officials and merchants still in collusion with one another to do such unconscionable deeds in spite of strictly enforced laws in place nowadays.\u201d The Minister of Justice, Kong Qiu, said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t carry out a thorough investigation of this matter, there we will not be able to give the various generals of Libei an explanation. This humble subject requests a Joint Trial by the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices\u00a0with the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0to launch a search and investigation from Baimazhou to\u00a0Qudu. We must get to the bottom of the matter!\u201d\u201cNot only that. There\u2019s another matter that needs to be urgently attended to.\u201d The Minister of War, Chen Zhen, cast a glance at Xiao Chiye and said, \u201cThe military provisions for Qidong Five Commanderies similarly comes from Baimazhou. We must dispatch an urgent report immediately to Commander-in-chief Qi. This batch of grains should not be distributed further down the line!\u201d\u201cHow are we going to make up for the shortage?\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s tone was icy. \u201cThese two batches of military provisions are the entire hoard amassed last year from the three great granaries of Juexi. Now that you are recalling them and rendering them useless, how is the military provisions shortage going to be filled? And from where are you going to supplement them? If the shortage cannot be filled within five days, Libei and Qidong will have to fight wars on empty stomachs. It\u2019s a question of feeding hundreds of thousands of people.\u201d\u201cBorrow and transfer from Huaizhou, Hezhou, and Cizhou. The receipts for the loans shall be borne by the imperial court. This matter is critical. The state treasury can\u2019t take out that much money at such short notice to buy. We can only promise to exempt these three prefectures from taxes for approximately two years.\u201d Hai Liangyi said in a steady and unhurried voice.\u201cIt\u2019s only with all the grains from the thirteen cities that Baimazhou was able to afford these two batches of military provisions. The three prefectures the Grand Secretary mentioned cannot be compared to it. Besides, these three prefectures are separated and far away from one another.1\u00a0Preparing and coordinating the grains to be escorted and transported will also take up several days.\u201d\u201cTell Qi Zhuyin that Qidong\u2019s military provision is reduced by half this year. They still have military fields to sustain them, so they still have extra resources. Hezhou leads straight to Qidong, while the grains from Cizhou and Huaizhou have to be transferred tonight.\u201d Although Hai Liangyi was still sick, he was still clear-headed in his arrangements. \u201cThe\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0is wounded. It\u2019s inadvisable for him to remain for long at the frontline. And the Prince of Libei is ill and is similarly indisposed to head out for war. Chen Zhen, draw up a name list of commanding generals and hand it to me an hour later. Within three days,\u00a0Qudu\u00a0must send a capable officer to Libei to take over its military affairs.\u201dHai Liangyi took charge of the situation and gave the final word. There was no doubt that Wei Huaigu would not get away this time. Xiao Chiye did not intend to let him off. He did not directly go straight for him at this juncture only because the redeployment of the commanding general was a far more important issue at present.Wei Huaigu was behaving a little oddly tonight. He kneeled where he was, never once explaining to vindicate himself even after a long time had passed.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Mingli Hall\u2019s side room was brightly illuminated, and the officials who had withdrawn from the court all gathered here. Hai Liangyi could not bear cold winter nights, so Kong Qiu draped an overcoat over him. He gathered the coat around him and gestured with his hand to motion for everyone to take a seat.\u201cI will send the impeachment memorial to the Grand Secretariat tomorrow.\u201d Cen Yu said. \u201cJust how many incidents have the Wei Clan been caught up in? His Majesty is mindful of showing mercy, so Wei Huaixing\u2019s incident the last time did not implicate Wei Huaigu, and he wouldn\u2019t admit his fault for what happened with the public ditches back then. And what about the military provisions this time? He can\u2019t escape blame for negligence and dereliction of duty!\u201d\u201cBeing an official in the imperial court has nothing to do with one\u2019s familial background and standing. When it comes to attending to official duties for the sovereign, don\u2019t keep using a person\u2019s surname to find faults with others. If he makes a mistake, then impeach him if you must.\u201d Hai Liangyi had yet to drink a drop of water tonight. He looked at Xiao Chiye and said, \u201cThe\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0has been leading the troops for several years. Since he was able to kill his way out of the heavy siege and return to Libei, his life is not in any danger. There is no need for Your Lordship to be anxious. If there is anything in shortage in Libei,\u00a0Qudu\u00a0will work through the night to allocate and transfer it.\u201dXiao Chiye had already understood what Hai Liangyi meant. To maintain the status quo, Hai Liangyi would not let Xiao Chiye return to Libei, no question about it. Xiao Jiming was defeated, but he was not dead\u2014and even if Xiao Jiming died, Xiao Chiye still could not return home, because there was still Xiao Fangxu.\u201cThere are countless decent generals in\u00a0Qudu, but those who can adapt to Libei are few and far between. The Hongyan eastern mountain range is close to the desert, and we are about to head into the Great Heat2\u00a0period in the sixth month. The frontier is brutally hot. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll be unsuitable if we dispatch an officer who was born in the southwest.\u201d Xiao Chiye sat on the chair, facing an entire room of veteran ministers, yet he was extremely calm. He reacted quickly, to the point he could be described as unassailable. He preemptively examined the case of the military provisions and told Hai Liangyi that it was fine to deploy a new general to Libei, but it had to be someone who came from Libei or Qidong; he did not want an armchair strategist who was all talk and no action.Hai Liangyi nodded approvingly at Xiao Chiye. At this point in time, one should indeed not be swayed by personal feelings and act impulsively for private gains and power. It was an indisputable fact that Libei lacked a commander to lead the troops. A deputy general who was skilled in warfare like Zhao Hui was formidable too, but they were all men whom Xiao Fangxu personally taught. They were originally meant to take on the tasks to coordinate and assist. It was fine for them to lead a troop of soldiers to outflank the enemies, but it was not enough to convince the masses if they were to lead Libei.But ever since the reign of Xiande, Dazhou had been faced with a dearth of able generals. Of the Four Great Generals, other than Zuo Qianqiu, the rest all had their own important duties to attend to. The abundance of talents further down were all high-ranking military officers from Qidong. They were all core members of the warfare squad whom Qi Zhuyin single-handedly trained from scratch. It was Qidong\u2019s military affairs that they were familiar with. To lend out any of them to Libei was easier said than done. Besides, the Qi Clan was about to enter a marriage alliance with the Hua Clan. If a Qidong\u2019s general were to manage Libei\u2019s military affairs temporarily, then this would break the status quo again, resulting in one clan rising in dominance and making it hard to hold them in check.Who to assign?Even Hai Liangyi\u2019s head hurt to think about it!As they burned with anxiety inside, Fuman, who was outside, suddenly hurried in and said, \u201cYour Excellencies, look who\u2019s here?\u201dXiao Chiye turned his head aside and suddenly rose to his feet. The entire hall of people followed suit and stood up too. Hai Liangyi stepped forward to greet and welcome the person personally.The man who took off his overcoat revealed his white hair, greeted Hai Liangyi, and then looked at Xiao Chiye.\u201cThis humble one raced through the night to hurry over to\u00a0Qudu\u00a0and to seek an audience with His Majesty for no other reason than the matter of Libei.\u201dThere was a lump in Xiao Chiye\u2019s throat as he said, \u201cShifu\u2026\u201dHowever, Zuo Qianqiu did not make conversation with him. Instead, he said to Hai Liangyi with a smile, \u201cIt has been many years since I last saw the Grand Secretary. I hope you are still in good health?\u201dHai Liangyi heavily gripped Zuo Qianqiu\u2019s wrists and said, \u201cAs old as Commander Zuo may be, can you still serve the country?\u201d3Zuo Qianqiu let out a long sigh and answered, \u201cAlthough I am not how I once was back in the prime of my life with this aged face and gray hair, I still have the strength to draw a bow and shoot. There\u2019s no need for the Grand Secretary to worry. My purpose for coming here this time is to: firstly, temporarily stand in for Jiming to manage Libei\u2019s military affairs; and secondly, deliver a message from Xiao Fangxu.\u201dThe entire room of people listened with rapt attention.Zuo Qianqiu looked at Xiao Chiye with a deep, profound gaze and said resolutely, \u201cThe might of the Prince of Libei has reverberated like a tiger\u2019s roar through Hongyan Mountains for more than ten years. His son has been defeated, and as his old man, he wants to personally reclaim victory from Amu\u2019er4\u00a0of the Hanshe Tribe.\u201dThe rain thundered, and the gyrfalcon let out a long cry as it circled among the dark clouds of\u00a0Qudu. Ten millions of\u00a0li5\u00a0away, the military flag of Libei flapped in the wind. Among the thick and heavy ink-colored rain, Xiao Fangxu, who had not stepped into the battlefield for decades, put on his armor and hung up his blade to lead the troops out to battle.The wind swept up Xiao Fangxu\u2019s cape, and he took off his incongruous bamboo hat.\u201cAmu\u2019er.\u201d Xiao Fangxu\u2019s voice was deep. He raised his arm in the rain to let out the raptors of Libei, and laughed aloud into the wind, \u201cLibei has drawn a demarcation line in the east, so what are you people trespassing over for? I\u2019ve told you decades ago that Hongyan Mountain is the turf of my Libei Armored Cavalry!\u201dHis voice reverberated through the rain. The armored cavalry behind him cloaked under black armors drew out their blades in unison, their thick, oppressive might like a creeping behemoth opening its eyes in the rainy night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 : LibeiZuo Qianqiu came just in time, leaving no chance for\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to send out a new general. \u201cThunder Sinking the Jade Stage\u201d was known far and wide for his military achievements. He was the great general after \u201cSilver Spear of Snow Pass\u201d, Feng Yisheng, and he was also Xiao Jiming, Qi Zhuyin, and Lu Guangbai\u2019s senior. It had been many years since he left Tianfei Watchtower. He had no private troops. Plus, he was also a child from a humble background that Ji Wufan, the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0Commander-in-Chief during the reign of Yongyi, adopted. He had no family background to get in the way. His willingness to come out of obscurity to lead the troops was something Hai Liangyi could not ask for more.As Zuo Qianqiu waited for Li Jianheng to summon him, he stood with Xiao Chiye under the eaves to watch the rain.\u201cThis entire journey has been a rush, so I didn\u2019t bring any message for you.\u201d Half of Zuo Qianqiu\u2019s overcoat was wet, all because he had never stopped the entire journey to rest except to change horses. He slowed his tone and said, \u201cJiming has already returned to the camp, and a military medic has been arranged to take care of him\u2026 Don\u2019t worry.\u201dBut Zuo Qianqiu omitted the extent of Xiao Jiming\u2019s injuries. Xiao Chiye partially lowered his head, then asked after a moment of silence, \u201cWhat injuries?\u201dZuo Qianqiu gazed out into the rainy night and said, \u201cThere are some words that you and I can only say while standing here. Jiming\u2019s food had been tampered with. Even Zhao Hui fell for the trap. The squad of soldiers dragged their sick bodies to the battlefield and just happened to encounter Amu\u2019er,1\u00a0who is the toughest of the lot to battle. Jiming received three slashes. It was Zhao Hui who tumbled off his horse and carried him on his back while leading the ten or more remaining soldiers to break out of the siege.\u201dXiao Chiye clenched his fists.There was darkness in Zuo Qianqiu\u2019s eyes as he said with a cool head, \u201cJiming has fought battles in the past while bogged down with ill health. He fought for so many years. He may seem to be fine on the surface, but in truth, he\u2019s already plagued by old ailments. This time, he could be said to have hurt his constitution. Using this opportunity to let him rest for half a year will permit him to recuperate and build up his strength again.\u201dThat might be the case, but Zuo Qianqiu had taught the two brothers, and he could not be any clearer about their temperaments. Xiao Jiming was soft on the outside but tough inside. He did not inherit Xiao Fangxu\u2019s extraordinarily strong and healthy physique, nor had he inherited Xiao Fangxu\u2019s uncompromising hard-nosed approach. Whatever he lacked, Xiao Chiye had it all. Perhaps someone else might be jealous, but Xiao Jiming cherished his family. He had the Princess Consort of Libei\u2019s compassion and benevolence ingrained in his nature, so he had never harbored the thought nor intent to trample upon his younger brother. He saw himself as a sanctuary for them and did all he could to self-heal his own wounds. All these years, he never uttered a cry of pain. Lu Guangbai repeatedly said before that he was human, but at the same time even as he retained his human desires, he forced himself to become the guardian of Libei.Still, it was Xiao Jiming\u2019s half-a-lifetime of honor and glory that the military defeat this time destroyed.It was at this moment Xiao Chiye abhorred his cage to the max. His wounds, as he struggled against his shackles, hurt the more he ground against them. They had already turned bloody. His gaze followed the raindrops and landed upon the ground, where the water puddle bore the weight of his silent agony. He braced himself and calmly said, \u201cThe meals in the military are all prepared by our own in-house errand-runners.\u00a0Dage\u00a0consumes the same food as the common soldiers. Harming him means harming thousands of men in the camp. We cannot drop this matter. I want them to pay with their lives!\u201d\u201cThose in charge of the meals have already been executed.\u201d Zuo Qianqiu looked at Xiao Chiye. \u201cIt was Jiming\u2019s idea.\u201dLibei had to bear such a grave grievance, yet they still reported it as \u201cmilitary provisions adulterated with mold\u201d instead of \u201cpremeditated murder attempt\u201d. Xiao Jiming broke out of the siege with sustained wounds. He hung on until the moment before he fell into a coma to give the order to execute those errand-runners, all to prevent others from investigating under the charge \u201cconspiracy to murder\u201d. A deliberate attempt to murder suggested a power struggle. Lifting the veil away would only muddy the situation. It was all too easy for Libei to be used by someone as a weapon. With Xiao Jiming\u2019s retreat, the appointment for a general for Libei\u2019s troops would fall into\u00a0Qudu\u2019s hands. Who could guarantee that the person who added in the poison was the real murderer? It was not unheard of to kill by proxy. Besides, assuming the moldy grains and poisoning were just the first steps, then if they reported the murder case and the imperial court could not find the perpetrator, the noble clans, in their denunciations, could distort the facts and falsely incriminate them for stooping to deception by using Xiao Jiming\u2019s injuries and defeat to get Xiao Chiye back.\u201cYou did well too. You didn\u2019t tell them you want to return to Libei to rally the forces and attempt a comeback.\u201d Zuo Qianqiu revealed a despondent expression. \u201cIf you had spoken frankly and fought for Libei\u2019s military power before the emperor, then their guilt tonight would have become machinations. It would also put His Majesty on the alert and set the stage for future troubles.\u201d\u201cI expect that the Grand Secretary will not set me free.\u201d Xiao Chiye forced himself to pull himself together. \u201cIt\u2019s as\u00a0shifu\u00a0says. Fighting for military power will only make His Majesty afraid, and I still have 20,000 men in the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0in my hands. This is a big taboo. What\u2019s more, stirring up troubles and making unreasonable demands at this juncture will hold up Libei\u2019s military affairs.\u00a0Shifu\u00a0coming here has helped me out of my predicament.\u201d\u201cWhen I have my audience with His Majesty later, I\u2019ll discuss the dispatch issue of the military provisions with the Ministry of Revenue and Grand Secretary in detail. I\u2019ll have to get on my horse and head back at dawn tomorrow morning at the very latest. Your father has waged war with Amu\u2019er at the eastern mountain range. He\u2019s launching a frontal assault first. No matter what, we have to knock their momentum down.\u201d This was not the place to talk after all, and Zuo Qianqiu stopped after discussing a little about the military situation. He merely said, \u201cIt has been a long time since I last led the troops. I\u2019ll have to familiarize myself with the military affairs as soon as I can on my return to the camp. Libei is different from Tianfei Watchtower. Libei Armored Cavalry is skilled in storming the enemy, while I used to be on the defensive back at Tianfei Watchtower. I have to discuss this properly with your father. And one more thing. Zhao Hui is also seriously injured this time. He only has a younger sister who married into\u00a0Qudu\u00a0left in his family.2\u00a0Remember to get Chen Yang to go over the Ministry of Rites later to let them know that all is well.\u201dXiao Chiye nodded his head in acknowledgment. Just then, Fuman came to invite Zuo Qianqiu inside. Zuo Qianqiu took one last look at Xiao Chiye and said, \u201cYou\u2019re alone in\u00a0Qudu. Take good care of yourself.\u201dXiao Chiye performed the disciple\u2019s bow to him, and Zuo Qianqiu strode forward and lifted the curtain to enter.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Fei Sheng got his wish these days to handle matters at Jiang Qingshan\u2019s side. Something had gone wrong with Juexi\u2019s military provisions tonight, and Jiang Qingshan, who still held the post of Provincial Administration Commissioner of Juexi, had to make a trip to Mingli Hall to discuss the matter and would not be out for at least a couple hours. Fei Sheng\u2019s old ailment acted up again. Wanting to rest for a moment in the office, he sent a junior eunuch to get him some food.Fei Sheng was sitting on the chair with one leg propped over the other to wait when he suddenly heard a sound from the door. He took a look with help from the candlelight. Seeing that it was Han Cheng, he hurriedly got up to pay his respects.Han Cheng, who had just arrived after braving the rain, motioned for him to rise. Fei Sheng went up to remove the overcoat from Han Cheng. Han Cheng asked, \u201cHas His Majesty summoned them to ask about it?\u201dFei Sheng knew he was asking about something else, so he replied in a deferential manner, \u201cCommander Zuo is here.\u201d\u201cZuo Qianqiu?\u201d Han Cheng was taken aback and blanked out for a moment. \u201cHe lives up to his name as the Prince of Libei, with reactions so swift that others are not given the opportunity to exploit any openings. With Commander Zuo\u2019s appearance, there will be no other candidate in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0who can surpass him. This Libei Armored Cavalry is still the Armored Cavalry of Libei.\u201dFei Sheng concurred but did not continue the topic. He knew that these were not matters he could involve himself in, so he would stay for as far away as he could. Han Cheng knew what he was thinking and held him in contempt for that.Those\u00a0shu\u00a0sons born of concubines were all like this. They had no guts and no spunk. They eyed the bit of carrot dangling before them all day long, but made no attempt to forge ahead.But while this was how Han Cheng thought, he still instructed Fei Sheng with an amiable countenance. \u201cAlthough this matter is somehow linked to Jiang Qingshan, it is still not a job he handled after all. The higher-ups won\u2019t blame him for this. Following him is indeed a good path that will open up opportunities for you. He is heading for Zhongbo next month. In the future, when the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0head there for fieldwork, they will all have to rely on you to pave the way for them. Xiaosheng, work hard and do your best.\u201dFei Sheng hurriedly responded in the affirmative and saw Han Cheng out. As he lowered his head to lift the hem of Han Cheng\u2019s robe for him, he suddenly saw the corner of the robe stained with some grayish-black dirt. He instantly patted it away quickly for Han Cheng and fawned on him, saying, \u201cDid Your Excellency come over on foot? How\u2026\u201dHan Cheng unexpectedly yanked over the corner of his robe. Fei Sheng\u2019s voice promptly came to a halt.Outside, the heavy rain poured, and the play of shadow and light from the candle sunk Fei Sheng\u2019s face into the darkness. In that very instant, the office fell so silent that one could hear a pin drop. But in just a blink of an eye, Fei Sheng raised his head and squeezed out a smile as if nothing had happened. Obsequiously, he said. \u201cThe smudge of mud has already been wiped off. Your Excellency, please be careful on your way out.\u201dHan Cheng stared at him and slowly released his grip on the corner of his robe. He smiled along with him and said after a moment had passed, \u201cYou may go about your business.\u201dThe moment Han Cheng had left, Fei Sheng\u2019s face turned cold. He lifted his hand and looked carefully at the residue of dirty mud on his fingertips under the candlelight. There was wood ash mixed within, and the rainwater had turned it into such a sludge that the color was hard to make out, but the bit of red mud mixed up with it did not escape his eyes.The Xi\u2019s Residence had been burned down, and the dye the Xi Clan had used happened to be imported red clay. This stuff was valuable and hard to get. Even a prince\u2019s residence was not as this capable as the Xi Clan. Other than the Xi Clan, there were no other clans in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0who could use it.What was Han Cheng doing at the Xi\u2019s Residence at this time?Fei Sheng wiped away the mud on his fingertip. The cold sweat on his back had broken out earlier when his eyes had met Han Cheng\u2019s. He stood under the light with his thoughts in disarray, but he was sure of one thing\u2014Han Cheng\u2019s intent to kill him had already been ignited in that one exchange of gaze.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8The next day, Zuo Qianqiu returned to Libei on horseback. Xiao Chiye accompanied Hai Liangyi to send him out of the city. He could not return home, but he could deploy Chen Yang and Gu Jin out to follow the grains distribution officials to Huaizhou and Cizhou to supervise the military provisions. Nothing must go wrong with the military provisions this time. Xiao Chiye could not trust the men from the Six Ministries. He had long planted Wang Xian in Cizhou. Then he had gotten Pan Lin to transfer Liang Cuishan to Huaizhou. This way, he would not miss a single detail of the overall planning for Libei\u2019s military provisions.\u201cWhen Liang Cuishan returns,\u201d Xiao Chiye, who had not slept for the entire night, wiped his face with a cold handkerchief and said, \u201cI\u2019ll have to convey to him my proper thanks.\u201dShen Zechuan sat in the carriage. He had not slept last night either, having stood guard over the hall. On hearing him, he said, \u201cI have already made arrangements to settle his family down in the residence. Someone will be on night patrol to watch over them, just so he can do his job with peace of mind. Huaizhou differs from Cizhou; it has no dealings with us, and now we are getting them to prepare the military provisions at such a brief notice. Huaizhou Prefectural Prefect must be feeling rather reluctant.\u201d\u201cHuaizhou is exempted from handing over military provisions for eight years. The reason Hai Liangyi considered them is that they can afford to do so.\u201d Covering himself with the handkerchief, Xiao Chiye leaned back against the carriage wall and continued after a moment\u2019s pause, \u201cWe have to arrest Wei Huaigu today. We can\u2019t let him land in the hands of the Ministry of Justice.\u201dThey had friendly relations with the Minister of Justice, Kong Qiu, and they had a good time drinking wine together the last time too. But this bit of friendship could not be compared to Hai Liangyi. Xiao Chiye had already given up the idea of beating around the bush with them. He wanted to sever Wei Huaigu\u2019s retreat route, so he could only make this case bypass the Joint Trial by the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices\u00a0and have it end up in the hands of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2014that is, Shen Zechuan.\u201cWei Huaigu.\u201d Shen Zechuan fiddled with the waist token that had been set aside on the small table. He thought for a moment with a solemn expression, then said, \u201cSince he had already intercepted the express relay report, it means that he does not want it to make its way to the emperor. Yet, he changed his mind at the last minute. There must be a reason for it.\u201dXiao Chiye recalled Wei Huaigu in Mingli Hall last night and said, \u201cHe was indeed acting abnormally last night. Going by his temperament, he should be trying every means possible to pass the buck or pick a scapegoat from the Ministry of Revenue to take the blame. But not only did he not try to wrangle his way out, he even answered when asked.\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s fingertips stopped with a \u201cthud\u201d. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s true that Baimazhou had a bumper harvest last year. Now that the military provisions have been adulterated with substandard grains, then where did such a big batch of grain go?\u201dXiao Chiye pulled off the handkerchief. Clutching it in his hands, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s having designs on wealth that causes loss of lives. If these grains were to set out from Baimazhou via Hezhou\u2019s waterways, then it would be able to bypass\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to lead directly to Zhongbo, where they can brand it under a merchant\u2019s label and sell it out at a high price as grains for the common folks.\u201d\u201cThere were already rumors before the new year that Jiang Qingshan was going to Zhongbo to assume the position of Provincial Administration Commissioner. If someone were to make much of this matter, then it\u2019s clear what\u2019s going on.\u201d Shen Zechuan raised his eyes to exchange gazes with Xiao Chiye. \u201cSomeone in the Provincial Administration Commission of Juexi has been colluding with the wealthy merchants to resell the military grains at a profit. Because Jiang Qingshan was there in the past to oversee the entire operation and to strictly check the provisions, they carried it out on a small scale. But this year, Jiang Qingshan was going to be transferred out of Juexi, and he entered the capital after the new year to report for duty. He had to undergo the judicial process of vetting and waiting for a review trial, so he had no way to supervise Juexi\u2019s preparation and coordination of the military provisions, and this gave the other party an opening to exploit. It\u2019s just that no one expected them to be so bold as to dare to use moldy grains as substitutes.\u201d\u201cThose who can take this much grains are few and far between.\u201d The expression in Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes was deep and unfathomable. \u201cWithout their own caravan of traveling merchants to conduct the transaction, no one would dare to touch it.\u201d\u201cXi Hongxuan.\u201d Shen Zechuan said slowly.\u201cXi Hongxuan.\u201d Xiao Chiye said with certainty. \u201cHe died not because of you and me, but because he had already become a sacrificial pawn who could implicate others. Wei Huaigu tried every means to make Xi Hongxuan take the blame in the collapse case. Was it because both of them were already dealing in private to resell military provisions for profit, and Wei Huaigu was worried that Xi Hongxuan would be subjected to rigorous checks, that was why he wanted him dead?\u201dShen Zechuan contemplated it over for a moment, then said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Xi Hongxuan had indeed said before that Wei Huaigu did it for the money. The fact that he agreed back then to give Wei Huaigu money so quickly shows that he knew Wei Huaigu\u2019s character very well and thought that Wei Huaigu would do this. If that was the case, Xi Hongxuan is already dead. Wei Huaigu had no need to take such a big risk to continue doing this. I suspect this wasn\u2019t done by Wei Huaigu this time. Someone got a handle on him because of the earlier deals. That was why he knew he had already been treated as a tool when he saw the relay report. There was no escape for him now. Given how he did not argue back to vindicate himself, it\u2019s very likely he knew who the other party is. He\u2019s trying to imitate Hua Siqian at this moment\u2014by using his life to prevent the Wei Clan from suffering further losses.\u201dListening to the sound of rain in this interval of political intrigue against one another, Xiao Chiye felt a tinge of exhaustion washed over him. Xiao Jiming did right. Libei\u2019s timely execution of the mess cooks was precisely to prevent themselves from being used as a pawn and becoming a stepping stone for the others to eradicate dissidents.No.\u00a0Maybe not just a stepping stone. They indeed wanted to use this military defeat to reduce Libei\u2019s military power. They wanted to break up the Libei Armored Cavalry, which had always been in the hands of the Xiao Clan, and hand it over to\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to control and command. This way, even if they could not take down Libei immediately, they could still create the effect of supervision by an Army-inspecting Censor,3\u00a0thereby restraining and holding the Xiao Clan in check.\u201cIf Commander Zuo had not arrived in time tonight\u2026\u201d Shen Zechuan held Xiao Chiye\u2019s hand and looked at him in this cramped carriage. \u201cThen the appointment of\u00a0Qudu\u2019s new general would have been issued this morning, and the Libei Armored Cavalry would no longer be the Libei Armored Cavalry.\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s hand was icy cold. It took him a long while before he lifted his hand to stroke Shen Zechuan\u2019s hair. He said in a hoarse voice, \u201cLibei Armored Cavalry is the Armored Cavalry of Dazhou\u2026 Father personally established it with his own hands; it\u2019s far more important than my eldest brother and me. For so many years,\u00a0Qudu\u00a0doesn\u2019t understand that we serve as an impenetrable fortress in Libei. We are not treasonous traitors.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 : AnxietyThe sky was already dark when the rain stopped, with a few thin rays of fading light leaking out amongst the thick clouds. Black boots that came and went trampled on the water on the ground, sending them splashing, with the puddles reflecting the fractured dome of heaven. It was clearly the beginning of summer at this moment, but\u00a0Qudu\u00a0still seemed to be soaking in the rainy season; it had already been days since the capital last saw clear skies.Having only gotten some free time now, Hai Liangyi sat on the\u00a0taishi\u00a0chair1\u00a0and drank strong tea. He was old, and it was hard for his spirit to keep up. He was already feeling fatigued. But there were officials moving all around him attending to their duties, and the document exchanging hands also needed his perusal and approval. He was not at liberty to rest.\u201cSecretariat Elder.\u201d Kong Qiu took a temporary rest from the cases on his desk and said respectfully to Hai Liangyi from where he was seated below the latter, \u201cThe Ministry of Revenue must be held responsible for the incident with the military provisions this time. This pupil has already submitted the request for the Joint Trial by the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices\u00a0to His Majesty yesterday. This matter can\u2019t be delayed. What do you think if this pupil gets started on the arrest tonight?\u201dHai Liangyi was slow to answer as he stirred aside the tea foam. He looked at the window and only said after a long time had passed, \u201cI\u2019ve been sitting for so long it makes me tired. His Majesty is still having his meal at present. Come with me for a walk outside.\u201dKong Qiu personally took Hai Liangyi\u2019s overcoat from the junior eunuch and put it on for him. Both men walked out of the office. It was already dark outside. Kong Qiu carried a lantern and followed Hai Liangyi along the small garden of the office compound.\u201cYou want to arrest Wei Huaigu, and there is nothing wrong with it.\u201d Contrary to expectation, Hai Liangyi felt a little more comfortable bathing in the night wind. He took a few more slow steps and said, \u201cThis incident concerns the stability of the frontier. You mustn\u2019t be too lenient with Wei Huaigu. Just handle it in accordance with the law.\u201dKong Qiu guessed that Hai Liangyi still had something to say to him, so he lit the way for Hai Liangyi. Already changing his form of address, he said, \u201cI shall do as Teacher says. This pupil thinks the same too. He\u2019s so audacious this time that it won\u2019t work even if the Empress Dowager wants to shield him. This pupil can see that he\u2019s been increasingly acting out of line this year. Someone should have given him a warning a long time ago. Military affairs are not like other governmental affairs. This matter must never be tolerated and condoned.\u201d\u201cThat the Prince of Libei put on his armor once again to head into the battlefield is an admonition to\u00a0Qudu.\u201d Hai Liangyi stopped. He could no longer see the light between Heaven and Earth. He stood still in silence for a long while before he said, \u201cXiao Fangxu is the alpha wolf. In the power struggle between Libei and the Hua Clan all these years, he has never once stepped out of Libei due to ill health. He watches Xiao Jiming exhaust himself mentally and physically, and watches Xiao Chiye trapped in the imperial city. He places both of his sons in dangerous circumstances. Why do you think he did that?\u201dAffected by Hai Liangyi\u2019s tone, Kong Qiu subconsciously grew more heavy-hearted. He said, \u201cConcession. The Prince of Libei is making concessions with his sons. The longstanding noble clans have established themselves into a fortress in\u00a0Qudu, and he broke the \u2018rule\u2019 from the frontier. Perhaps he once had the opportunity to advance, but he retreated.\u201d\u201cHe retreated. Yet the Empress Dowager didn\u2019t understand.\u201d Feeling physically and mentally exhausted, Hai Liangyi said, \u201cThe Empress Dowager didn\u2019t understand, neither did Wei Huaigu or the noble clans. Xiao Fangxu broke the rule, and he backed off not because of fear, but because he was willing to accede to the sovereign-subject relationship between Dazhou and Libei. But as they say, things will reverse in the opposite direction when they hit their limits.2\u00a0Chasing after the Xiao Clan this urgently to beat them down is like urging Xiao Fangxu to turn back. Since time immemorial, power struggles have always been unavoidable. But when it comes to wars, it\u2019s often an ominous sign that the situation is hopeless. The Zhongbo troops suffered a defeat in the era of Xiande. Back then, the entire imperial court was full of corrupt officials who trampled upon the governmental affairs and made a mess of it! We have now regained the mess, and we are in trouble both internally and externally.\u201dHai Liangyi coughed in the wind and refused Kong Qiu\u2019s attempt to support him.\u201cIt\u2019s only this year that the state treasury has the spare resources to bear the expenses for the local aid reliefs. Juexi did good and lived up to expectations by settling the military provisions issue for the two great armies. With Libei and Bianjun Commandery stable, and with capable minister Jiang Qingshan about to be transferred to Zhongbo, there\u2019s hope for Zhongbo\u2019s revival. The Imperial College is on the rise, and scholars from humble backgrounds are gradually increasing. The\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0has Cen Yu to lead it, and of the up-and-coming talents, there\u2019s Yu Xiaozai. His Majesty also no longer indulges in having fun.\u201d Sorrow gradually washed over Hai Liangyi. \u201cI initially thought that a new dawn was about to begin in Dazhou, yet I now increasingly find myself in a situation where my spirit is willing but my flesh is weak.\u201dAlarmed, Kong Qiu forcibly held Hai Liangyi to support him. His eyes reddened, and he said, \u201cWhy does Teacher speak of such demoralizing words? The Prince of Libei is absolutely not that kind of person. This pupil will preside over the trial this time. I will definitely not let Libei suffer this injustice. There is still a chance to turn things around!\u201dHowever, Hai Liangyi did not pull himself together. How far can this emaciated body still walk while holding up Dazhou? He was just one man who could not save the situation on his own, much like one log alone could not prop up an entire building. He differed from the others; he could not act as recklessly and unscrupulously like the noble clans, nor could he turn completely to Libei. He was the Grand Secretary of the Grand Secretariat, and the one he supported was Li Jianheng. He had to make a decision that would maintain the balance in the given situation. Even if this decision might lead him to complete annihilation, he still must do it.\u201cLibei\u2019s fury has already been ignited. Xiao Fangxu is now urging his troops on to Hongyan eastern mountain range, but once the war subsides, he will no doubt turn back to settle this score with\u00a0Qudu.\u201d Hai Liangyi calmed down amidst the sound of coughing. \u201cWhen the time comes, no matter how he rages, we mustn\u2019t release Xiao Chiye, even if Libei is willing to use Princess Consort of the\u00a0Hereditary Prince, Lu Yizhi, and Grandson-heir, Xiao Xun, in exchange for him. He placed both sons in dangerous situations with the intent to toughen them up all precisely for this day. Xiao Jiming is severely wounded, and this is just the time for him to lie low. Xiao Chiye made a name for himself in his youth, and Xiao Fangxu put him in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to temper him for six years. Now that this blade is forged and his glory is known, letting him go back will be sowing the seeds of future disaster, much like releasing the tiger back into the mountain. I\u2019m already at this age. Boran, I can\u2019t hold out for much longer! We have to treat Libei well, but we still can\u2019t let go of the rope we tether them with. I know that there will be many people lambasting me for being decrepit and muddle-headed after my death. But Boran, who dares to tell it to my face that Libei will really not rebel? That Qidong will really not rebel? Even if the Xiao Fangxu of today can endure it, can a Xiao Chiye who takes over the Commander-in-Chief seat someday tolerate it? Dazhou cannot afford to stake it all on this! I will take responsibility for deciding what should be given to Libei; not a single item will be lacking. This time, Wei Huaigu had the audacity to resell the military provisions for profit. You go ahead and behead him in accordance with the law! Whoever pleads for mercy, I will remonstrate and impeach him!\u201dKong Qiu voiced his acknowledgment.Hai Liangyi paused for a moment to brace himself before he continued, \u201cI\u2019m going to send a letter to the Prince of Libei to do away with the need for the Army-inspecting Censor.3\u00a0This time, the imperial court will not assign an inspection eunuch to stir up trouble. All major and minor military affairs of Libei will still be managed by the Prince of Libei himself.\u201dKong Qiu hesitated for a moment before saying, \u201cI am afraid the Empress Dowager will not agree to do away with the Army-inspecting Censor.\u201d\u201cIs there no emperor in Dazhou? It is a century-old rule that the harem should not interfere with government affairs. It\u2019s not up to her to decide this time. Besides, fighting a war is no joke. What\u2019s the use of sending a few castrated eunuchs who only know how to fawn on others? They are just a waste of food.\u201d Hai Liangyi took a few more steps and continued, \u201cThe eunuchs are all personal attendants of the\u00a0Son of Heaven. The\u00a0Twenty-Four Yamen\u00a0could be called the \u2018inner court\u2019. Having resided for long deep in the palace, they know not of the sufferings of the people, nor do they understand the ways of the sages. Pan Rugui was an eunuch who had attended the Eunuch School, but all he did was to frame loyal, upright men and bring harm upon the state. A wise man foresees and mitigates risks. The eunuch faction has only just been eliminated, we mustn\u2019t give them any more opportunities. I\u2019ll get Chen Zhen to draft the memorial now. Submit it to His Majesty tonight.\u201dFuman came looking for them with a lantern in hand from the other side. He did not dare to approach them and merely paid his obeisances from afar and said in a solemn voice, \u201cSecretariat Elder and Your Excellency the Minister, this way, please. You have been summoned to the hall.\u201dHai Liangyi answered in a muted voice. He did not look kindly upon Fuman either. Kong Qiu supported him by the arm and walked back with him. Only when he was this close to Hai Liangyi\u2019s body did he realize just how skinny the Grand Secretary had become. He felt a stab of sorrow and grief in his heart, although his expression gave nothing away under the darkness.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xiao Chiye re-tidied his robes and crown and entered the hall once again. This time, Xue Xiuzhuo was also present, with a spot at the end.\u201cThe case of the military provisions is of grave importance, and it involves the collusion between officials and merchants for illegal profits. It\u2019s a bad influence on the local officials. If it can\u2019t be dealt with promptly and severely, then those scums will only take it for granted and have no regard for the law.\u201d Having smoked his pipe outside, Cen Yu curbed his impatience and said, \u201cYour Majesty, I request to start the investigation and prosecution tonight. First, apprehend Wei Huaigu into the penal prison and have someone keep an eye on the Wei Clan\u2019s account books and manors. We can\u2019t let them take advantage of the disorder to transfer away the ill-gotten gains.\u201dLi Jianheng had also been hanging on for a day and a night, and he was now so tired he could barely open his eyes. He managed with some difficulty to nod his head and said, \u201cThe military provision is a major issue. He made a mess of matters. Whether he should be executed or have his properties sealed, the Grand Secretariat may just deal with him at its own discretion and as it deems fit.\u201d\u201cThe reach of this case stretches so far and wide that even Jiang Qingshan has to remain in his post pending the trial. Plus, the Wei Clan is a large clan with an extensive business empire. I\u2019m afraid it can\u2019t be done within half a month with the Ministry of Justice acting alone on its own.\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s thumb rubbed the space between his thumb and index finger gently, and the thumb ring slowly rotated. He said, \u201cLikewise, the Joint Trial by the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices\u2019 epidemic case is still pending. To strictly guard against the emergence of similar official-merchant collusion cases elsewhere, the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0still has to free up personnel to head down and check the accounts of the various areas. Seems to me that everyone has their own difficulties and are similarly short on manpower.\u201d\u201cYour Lordship has a point.\u201d Xue Xiuzhuo continued in a soft voice. \u201cBut everything has its own importance and urgency. Libei is fighting a war at present, so the matter of the military provision is of top priority. The Ministry of Justice and the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau\u00a0naturally have to put this matter first. It\u2019s not an issue at all.\u201dBlockhead Li Jianheng could tell that Xiao Chiye was hinting at something to him. But with Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s interruption, he did not know how to continue. Scratching his cheeks, he looked at Hai Liangyi and asked, \u201cWhat does the Secretariat Elder think?\u201dHai Liangyi did not look at any of them. After a moment\u2019s pause, he said, \u201cIs Your Lordship worried that the Joint Trial by the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices\u00a0will drag the case on for too long?\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cThe workflow of the Joint Trial by the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices\u00a0is too complex. Wei Huaigu has been in the top position for so long that his thinking and methods are all different from the common man. I\u2019m worried that it will cause further complications if we keep him around for too long.\u201dLi Jianheng hurriedly cut in, \u201cThat\u2019s right. The Wei Clan has always shown filial respect to the Empress Dowager. If this case drags on for too long, I\u2019m worried that the Empress Dowager will be overwhelmed with worries and end up causing her health to deteriorate.\u201d\u201cBut without the Joint Trial by the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices, we can\u2019t thoroughly investigate the various profiteering loose ends down there.\u201d Disagreeing, Kong Qiu said, \u201cThese people are only this audacious before they have Wei Huaigu to shield them. It\u2019ll be a disaster to let all of them run free.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m merely worried about the time. I\u2019m not saying that we shouldn\u2019t investigate.\u201d Xiao Chiye looked at Li Jianheng. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this is the only course for\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to take?\u201dSomething clicked in Li Jianheng\u2019s mind, and he slapped his thigh and picked up the thread, \u201cFor a speedy investigation, we should let the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0handle it! That Shen Zechuan was pretty fast in his handling of the previous matter in which Xi Hongxuan assembled notorious bandits. Why not let him take charge of this case?\u201dXue Xiuzhuo said, \u201cThis is such a major case. I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t do to hand it over to the Vice Commander of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards. Shen Zechuan will be limited by his rank. It\u2019d be more appropriate to hand it to the Commander-in-chief, Han Cheng.\u201dXiao Chiye shifted his gaze to Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s face and pulled his lips into a smile. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Shen Zechuan is indeed not suitable to take charge of this case. He\u2019s young and lacking in experience, and he has a longstanding grudge against me. I can\u2019t rest reassured if we hand it over to him.\u201dOn the contrary, his retreat in order to advance4\u00a0convinced Hai Liangyi. Hai Liangyi knew Han Cheng had some friendly relations with Xiao Chiye too. He was worried that Xiao Chiye might use this and go too far with his handling of this case, so he might as well hand it over to Shen Zechuan, who had always been at odds with Xiao Chiye, to handle. With both men standing in diametrical opposition to each other and mutually monitoring one another, no one would be able to play dirty tricks and tamper with the case.\u201cYour Lordship, this is just your prejudice. Shen Zechuan is indeed young and lacking in experience, but it was by imperial decree he was first promoted up the ranks where he dealt with one tough case after another. Letting him gain more experience is a good thing too.\u201d Hai Liangyi turned to Li Jianheng and said, \u201cHaving the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0as the chief investigators of this case means that it\u2019ll be handled by the\u00a0Imperial Prison, and it just so happened that Shen Zechuan is the Northern Judge.5\u00a0Given his official duties and job responsibilities, his handling of the case is justified and reasonable. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s inadvisable to persist in aiming for speed. Although we are bypassing the Joint Trial by the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices, there is still a need for the\u00a0Three Judicial Offices\u00a0to supervise. What does Your Majesty think?\u201dLi Jianheng knew that Hai Liangyi was making concessions by this. He did not dare to be too overly partial towards Xiao Chiye, so he instantly agreed and said, \u201cI\u2019ll issue the edict to him right at once to start the investigation tonight.\u201dTwo consecutive days of official discussions in Mingli Hall finally came to a momentary halt. Everyone had to return and rest for a night. As they stepped out of the hall, Li Jianheng specifically let the eunuchs carry the sedan and send Hai Liangyi to the palace gates to get on his horse carriage. Kong Qiu and the rest walked out together. Xiao Chiye nodded farewell to them and left alone.Kong Qiu looked at Xiao Chiye\u2019s back and sighed, \u201cThe way I see it, he\u2019s too broken-hearted to trust the Ministry of Justice to preside over the case and wants to investigate it together with Han Cheng.\u201dCen Yu descended the stairs and said, \u201cAnd look at just who Han Cheng is? The Secretariat Elder was right to choose Shen Zechuan. Is Yanqing heading straight back to your residence?\u201dXue Xiuzhuo followed behind them with a smile on his face and said, \u201cYes. I\u2019ve been resting in the office compound these few days. I should go back tonight and get the preparations ready. There are still cases to handle a few days later.\u201dCen Yu was very caring and nurturing of his juniors, and promoted them very often. He had personally guided Yu Xiaozai of the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau, whose career had blossomed under his mentorship, and he occasionally gave Shen Zechuan advice too, all of which was out of concern. He also valued Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s talents, so when he heard these words of his, he simply had to encourage him some.The three men got into their respective horse carriages at the palace entrance.It was deep in the night when the servant of the Xue\u2019s Residence heard a knock at the door, so he threw on his clothes and came out for a look. Standing outside the door were all solemn-looking\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0with their blades. He was startled. Before he had time to ask questions, Qiao Tianya, who was at the lead, leisurely squeezed his way through the door and pushed the man aside.\u201cHave you eaten? It\u2019s still early at present, so you probably haven\u2019t taken your meal yet. Then go inform the kitchen to prepare meals for us\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0too. And while you are at it, call everyone up. We\u2019re going to search the residence.\u201dThe steward lifted his lantern to stop him in his tracks and yelled, \u201cYour Excellency, how can you do this? You haven\u2019t produce the search warrant\u2014\u201d\u201cTake all those who obstruct official duties and hold up the search and arrest into the\u00a0Imperial Prison.\u201d Shen Zechuan stood at the entrance, his gaze sinister and ruthless. \u201cTell Xue Xiuzhuo that I\u2019m looking for him.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 : GeneralThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0swarmed into the Xue\u2019s Residence and swiftly passed through the veranda to enter within. All the people in the various courtyards were startled awake. The women huddled together in fear as they were herded out of their houses towards an open space in the residence to assemble. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0had a reputation out there, and in these people\u2019s eyes, Shen Zechuan was a man-eating predator.1Xue Xiuyi hurriedly put on his clothes and stepped out. Seeing Xue Xiuzhuo standing under the eaves too, he could not help but lunge forward and hauled Xue Xiuzhuo as he said resentfully, \u201cWhat did you do to bring the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0to us?! If you implicate us and get us into trouble, I\u2019ll boot you out and have you disowned from the clan!\u201dXue Xiuzhuo turned his head to look at this savage-looking eldest brother of his and let him hauled as he liked. With pity and indifference in his eyes, he said, \u201cThe whole family gets a share in fame and fortune, but when misfortune befalls, one person alone bears it all. Eldest brother, have no fear. It\u2019s still far from your turn to be the head of this clan.\u201dHaving said that, he pushed Xue Xiuyi away and walked along the steps towards Shen Zechuan.This was the second time Shen Zechuan and Xue Xiuzhuo met head-on. Xue Xiuzhuo had not gone to bed yet. He had been in the study handling affairs pertaining to the cases and had promptly walked out with an azure wide-sleeved robe draped over him. This man had a calm and unhurried aura to him, and his scholarly elegance was not something that could be feigned overnight. He had real capabilities, and this was something Shen Zechuan never denied.\u201cTo what I owe the Vice-Commander\u2019s presence in my humble abode at this late hour?\u201d Xue Xiuzhuo, who was about the same height as Shen Zechuan, stood firm and said to Shen Zechuan, \u201cI should have prepared a simple meal with wine as a show of hospitality and welcomed you much earlier.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve just received the imperial edict. His Majesty orders me to take overall charge of the military provisions case. This is such a major issue, and the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, not daring to be sloppy, have promptly arrested Wei Huaigu.\u201d Shen Zechuan scrutinized the couplets in the main hall and did not look at Xue Xiuzhou as he said with nonchalance, \u201cWei Huaigu has always been on good terms with Assistant Minister Xue. In order for you to avoid suspicions, your residence will have to be searched tonight.\u201d\u201cI am fully aware that the Court of Judicial Review is assisting the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0with the case. But I am an appointed official of the imperial court. If the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0want to search my residence, you\u2019ll need the warrant issued by the Ministry of Justice.\u201d Xue Xiuzhuo looked around the courtyard and saw panic and confusion all around. He said, \u201cHowever, this case is urgent, and the Vice Commander has the prerogative to act first and report later. Uncle Xue, hand the keys to the inner courtyard to the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0as well. Lead the way to whichever area they wish to search.\u201dShen Zechuan inclined his head and said, \u201cYou are really something to be on guard even against an impromptu imperial edict issued by His Majesty.\u201dXue Xiuzhuo smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s only right that I act with caution when encountering a character like the Vice Commander. It\u2019s late and chilly out there. If the Vice Commander doesn\u2019t find it beneath you, would you like to have a cup of tea with me inside? This residence isn\u2019t small. By the time the search is done, it would be time for\u00a0morning court.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll skip the tea.\u201d Shen Zechuan slowly turned around. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to ask for tea from prominent clans. So does it mean I\u2019m going to have to return empty-handed again today?\u201dXue Xiuzhuo said, \u201cThat will have to depend on what the Vice Commander is here for. If it is to investigate the case, then it\u2019s indeed going to be regrettable. I\u2019m just acquaintances with Wei Huaigu; we aren\u2019t connected in any way.\u201dShen Zechuan fell silent. As he stared at Xue Xiuzhuo, that feeling of being played for a fool indistinctly resurfaced again. After a long while, Qiao Tianya returned to the open ground and shook his head at Shen Zechuan from afar. Shen Zechuan then knew that he had come up empty-handed once again\u2014Shifu\u00a0and Teacher were both not here.\u201cA wily hare has three burrows.\u201d2\u00a0Shen Zechuan said softly.\u201cJust a fish swimming at the bottom of the cauldron3\u00a0taking a momentary breather.\u201d Xue Xiuzhuo said in a deferential manner.\u201cYou only have this one chance with me.\u201d Shen Zechuan moved his feet and approached Xue Xiuzhuo. \u201cWhere are they?\u201dIt was a moonless night, with the after-rain dampness and chill pervasive all around. The men and women in the courtyard were all covering their faces and weeping. Xue Xiuyi did not know the details, but fearing Xue Xiuzhuo would infuriate Shen Zechuan, he hurriedly stepped forth and bowed to Shen Zechuan with his hands clasped before him. With trepidation, he said, \u201cWho is Your Excellency looking for? We are not harboring any fugitives from the military provisions case! All the people in the compound are here. Your Excellency, please feel free to interrogate them. We will definitely tell you all we know without holding anything back!\u201dXue Xiuzhuo said nothing, Seeing that he was not willing to reveal his\u00a0shifu\u2019s whereabouts, he said, \u201cI\u2019m looking for wanted criminals of the imperial court. I\u2019ve heard that there is a batch of prostitutes being kept in Assistant Minister Xue\u2019s residence. Is that right?\u201dXue Xiuzhuo\u2019s gaze flickered. Xue Xiuyi immediately butted in and said, \u201cYes, yes, there is! But matters like soliciting and consorting with prostitutes are all impeachable by the\u00a0Chief Surveillance Bureau. He has been pretty careful in hiding them, so the imperial censors have no awareness of it. Your Excellency, Your Excellency, please take a look. These are the children. They are just some little playthings. How could they be wanted criminals of the imperial court?\u201dShen Zechuan noticed the slight change in Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s expression at Xue Xiuyi\u2019s words. He turned his eyes to look at those boys and girls and said, \u201cWhat place is Xiangyun Villa? Everyone in there are all wanted criminals implicated in the assassination case. Assistant Minister Xue bought them from Xiangyun Villa without so much a word. Why wasn\u2019t the Ministry of Justice notified?\u201dXue Xiuzhuo pushed Xue Xiuyi aside and said, \u201cThese people all have proof of household registration. Although they are from the brothel, they are all innocent. The Vice Commander is currently on the military provisions case tonight. It has nothing to do with them, so why keep harping on it?\u201d\u201cWhether they are innocent or not, we will only find out after they make a trip to the\u00a0imperial prison.\u201d Shen Zechuan looked back and said, \u201cTake all these people away.\u201dThe group of people hugged themselves and cried out loud. Qiao Tianya took the lead and dragged them away. Under Xie Xiuzhuo\u2019s tutelage, those boys had been taught to carry themselves like the younger generation of distinguished clans, so how could they compare to the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards? In no time, their wails worsened. Xue Xiuyi was so frightened that his legs were trembling. Still wanting to mediate and say a few words of appeasement to ease the tension, he even brought out Xiao Chiye.\u201cYour, Your Excellency!\u201d Bracing himself, Xue Xiuyi said with difficulty, \u201cSince this matter concerns Libei, then why not ask, ask what His Lordship thinks\u2026 If there\u2019s really something wrong, then go ahead and take Xue Xiuzhuo away!\u201dXue Xiuzhuo suddenly took a few steps forward to obstruct Qiao Tianya. He bellowed, \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0still have to follow procedures even if you are officially on the case! Vice Commander Shen, you can take my people away, but I want to see the arrest warrant from the Ministry of Justice!\u201d\u201cTake them away!\u201d Shen Zechuan held up his blade to push back against him, forcing Xue Xiuzhuo to take a step back. He said, \u201cSince you want the arrest warrant, then I will give you as many as you want tomorrow morning!\u201d\u201cShen Zechuan!\u201d Xue Xiuzhuo abruptly flung his sleeves. \u201cI\u2019m going to impeach you for abusing the power of public office to avenge personal grudges!\u201d\u201cThen go ahead and submit the memorial for impeachment tonight!\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s tone turned frosty. \u201cThis batch of people is now in my hands. For each day I don\u2019t see Teacher, I will kill one! Guess how long will it take for me to kill my way to your precious student?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d Xue Xiuzhuo suddenly flew into a rage. Seeing that Qiao Tianya had already dragged them away to the other end where the wails were increasing in intensity, he grabbed Qiao Tianya\u2019s arm and said, \u201cYou people are accessories to crime by willfully arresting innocent commoners. So why investigate? Stop it!\u201d\u201cIf you dare to get in the way again, I\u2019ll kill them now!\u201d Shen Zechuan partially pressed his blade out of its sheath with his thumb, revealing a glint.Seeing Shen Zechuan made to draw his blade out amidst their dispute, Xue Xiuyi could not help but be so seized with terror that he actually fainted from the fright. The surrounding servants all yelled out \u201cEldest Master\u201d and hurried over to help him up. Xue Xiuzhuo, who was being dragged backward by the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, watched helplessly as the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0rounded all the students up onto the wagon.\u201cShen Zechuan!\u201d Xue Xiuzhuo held on to the arm blocking his way, his composure all but gone. With his eyes reddened, he spat resentfully, \u201cYou dare to kill them. You dare to kill them?! You tyrant! You aren\u2019t worthy of being Mister\u2019s student!\u201dShen Zechuan flipped atop his horse and left Xue Xiuzhuo\u2019s shouts of abuse all behind.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8The wars in Libei were concentrated in numbers and intensity. Likewise, it was not all quiet and still over at the Bianjun Commandery.Lu Guangbai returned to his camp for a rest. He had not even dismounted when he saw his deputy general hurrying over towards him. He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dThe deputy general did not look too good as he whispered, \u201cGeneral,\u00a0Qudu\u00a0has dispatched an Army-inspecting eunuch over. He brought this year\u2019s military provisions too.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Lu Guangbai dismounted, removed his helmet, and lifted the screen to enter the tent. An eunuch was sitting on the raised seat that had been set up inside; he was dressed in a python-patterned robe and wore a\u00a0yandun\u00a0hat4\u00a0on his head. Even when he saw Lu Guangbai stepping in, he did not get up to pay his obeisances.Lu Guangbai set aside his long spear and said, \u201cGonggong\u00a0has been rushing the entire journey. Why are you not taking a rest? I\u2019ll order the men to tidy up the tent.\u201dYingxi was a recently promoted eunuch. He had backings in the palace, and he knew that his masters had never looked kindly upon the Lu clan of the Bianjun Commandery, so he looked down upon Lu Guangbai too. On hearing him, he smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s desolate and barren here, and all the people here are clumsy fools, so how would they know how to serve others? There\u2019s no need for the general to go to such trouble. I have already taken a look around. That tent is so dark and filthy it\u2019s not inhabitable. I\u2019ve gotten men to hurry over to Cangjun to buy some timber with the plan to build a separate compound here\u2014I still have to stay here for half a year!\u201dLu Guangbai was not good with words. He knew that the Army-inspecting eunuchs were always this pretentious, and he could not be bothered to make conversation either. He undid the arm guard, and with the removal of that iron skin, filthy blood dripped onto the ground. On seeing this, Yingxi covered his nose in horror and exclaimed, \u201cHow did it fester to such an extent?!\u201dThe deputy general dragged the chest over with the intent to bandage it for Lu Guangbai. When he saw the wound, he said, \u201cGeneral, it\u2019s scraped so badly! We have to get the military medic over to take a look.\u201dLu Guangbai motioned for him to shut up and felt around the side of his thigh for a dagger. As he poured wine around his wound, he heated up the dagger in the candle flame until it was searing hot. The deputy general hurriedly held up his sleeve for him. Yingxi had never seen such a ruthless person before, and his limbs went cold as he listened to the sound of rotten flesh being gouged out. Lu Guangbai sprinkled the medicine over the wound and got the deputy general to bandage it for him.\u201cThe cavalry is hard to deal with. Without the deployment order, we can\u2019t pursue our way out of the delimited range, and we are naturally too occupied to bother with this when we are going back and forth engaged in attrition battles.\u201d Having cleaned up his wound, Lu Guangbai propped up his knee and looked at Yingxi to ask, \u201cDid\u00a0gonggong\u00a0come with the military provisions?\u201dYingxi forced back his disgust and nausea and nodded his head.Lu Guangbai rose and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go take a look.\u201dWith that, he stepped out of the tent with his deputy general and headed towards the military provisions. Those who had escorted and transported the military provisions had already withdrawn. Lu Guangbai made his way into the granary and opened up a burlap sack. Yet when he saw the provisions within, he frowned. He reached out to grab a handful\u2014it was all damp rice and moldy flour.\u201cGeneral.\u201d The deputy general said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just damp rice and moldy flour that were sent this time. The quantity is pathetic too. Our Bianjun Commandery has 20,000 men, and troops are dispatched every day to engage in guerrilla warfare. There\u2019s a lot of running around involved, and naturally the amount of food consumed is high too\u2014it can\u2019t be compared to the garrison troops of the other four commanderies. This bit of provision can\u2019t even last us until autumn!\u201dLu Guangbai\u2019s scarred palm released these grains and said, \u201cThe Secretariat Elder Hai has always looked out for us. Last year\u2019s military provisions were also allocated pretty quickly. Is there a reason for the reduction in quantity this time?\u201dThe deputy general\u2019s chest heaved. Several times, he wanted to say something, but then he held it back.Lu Guangbai said, \u201cJust say it if you have something to say. What is this for? Someone gag your mouth?\u201d\u201cGeneral!\u201d The deputy general was indignant. He stepped forth to grab those grains, and his emotions surged. He said in a tearful voice, \u201cThey gave us less! Why? Isn\u2019t it all because they were in a hurry to transfer it to Libei Armored Cavalry?! What the heck! Libei Armored Cavalry are all good men and soldiers, while the garrison troops of our Bianjun Commandery are all lowly bastards! They have always loved fawning on those at the top and bullying those at the bottom; they trampled on you every opportunity they can! But these are wars we are waging! We are all risking our own lives here, so on what grounds can they play favorites?! What issue do they have with our Bianjun Commandery?! We are already this poor, and they still want to skimp here and there! I asked those escorts who transported the food what are we to do in autumn, and they said the imperial court told us to play it by ear and take care of it ourselves! Do as we deem fit. Fuck them to hell and back!\u201dThe deputy general clenched his fists.\u201cQidong\u2019s military provisions were reduced by half to supply to Libei. But don\u2019t the other commanderies need to fight too?! They still have military fields to provide them with food to eat, but we can only eat empty air! Once autumn arrives, the horses of the Biansha Twelve Tribes will all be fattened up, and when that time comes, the battles will be even harder to fight! With just this bit of grains, we\u2014\u201d\u201cNot a word more!\u201d Lu Guangbai bellowed at the deputy general, stopping him in his tracks. He stood for a long time in the darkness. Eventually, he looked at the starry sky outside and said in a hoarse voice, \u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll think of a way.\u201dThe fire beacon towers of the Bianjun Commandery sat in silence between the rolling terrains, while the night, like the reversed flow of filthy waters, sealed this opening and obstructed them from seeing the light. Lu Guangbai did not have the prestigious reputation of the other three generals. He was just like the stubborn rock stationed at the edge of the desert, enduring the weight of oppressive pressure from three directions until it gradually eroded his originally round and smooth body into one with sharpened edges.5\u00a0Many people from their Lu clan had died, leaving only him to inherit Lu Pingyan\u2019s spear.He was this slow-witted. And he was this unlikable. He made a name for himself pretty late in his years, having none of the natural talents Xiao Jiming and Qi Zhuyin possessed. He was Lu Pingyan\u2019s youngest and stupidest son. Yet, it was also such a \u201chim\u201d who held up the Bianjun Commandery after Lu Pingyan\u2019s retirement. He choked off the strategic passage in which the Biansha Cavalry wanted to penetrate and advance through. He did not have a master; he was a general who learned his craft by following Lu Pingyan into the desert and tumbling his way out from the yellow sands. He treated others with sincerity. He\u2026 was riddled with scars all over.This very night, Lu Guangbai did not sleep. He sat hugging his spear on the earthen slope before the camp, unable to think of a way to resolve the shortage of military provisions. Qi Zhuyin had jurisdiction over the Five Commanderies. All these years, she had emptied her own private savings to give them financial aid; he could not keep asking Qi Zhuyin for help every single time. His old man at home was still ill too, so he could not ask Lu Pingyan to drag his sick body around to borrow money either.The deputy general saw Lu Guangbai\u2019s lonely back when he got up in the middle of the night to relieve himself. He wanted to go over and tell him to rest, but before he could approach, he saw Lu Guangbai bending over and reached out to touch the soil at his feet. For a long time, Lu Guangbai never raised his head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 : Raging WavesWei Huaigu was sent to prison to be placed on trial, while Yang Cheng of the Provincial Administration Commission of Juexi was also apprehended by the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0and taken to the\u00a0imperial prison. This was a major case in the year of Tianchen, and the entire court of civil and military officials was watching. Shen Zechuan moved very quickly. From the confession submitted by Yang Chen, he found out that Wei Huaigu had been reselling military provisions for profits ever since the fourth year of Xiande.Using his position as the Minister of Revenue, Wei Huaigu would buy military provisions from Yang Cheng each time he supervised the handling of the military provisions. Then he resold it at a higher price to Xi Hongxuan, who then separately sent these military grains via sea and land towards the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo and Xuhai to make a huge profit off them. In this way, he split the land tax among the commoners\u2019 fields in the thirteen cities of Juexi and let the common folk down there bear the tax\u201cSince you\u2019ve already been doing this for so long, then why was it only this time that you were pricked by your conscience into reporting Wei Huaigu through the relay report?\u201d Shen Zechuan looked through Yang Cheng\u2019s confession.Yang Cheng had been in the\u00a0imperial prison\u00a0for a few days. He lowered his head and said, \u201cThis time, moldy grains were used to fill it up; it\u2019s not the same as before. Libei is going to fight a war. These grains would be the poison that causes the death of the soldiers at the frontier pass if they were sent over. I was afraid that something bad would really happen to the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0of Libei.\u201dThere were no other people at the sides of the table. Xiao Chiye, who was sitting in the shadows, said out of the blue, \u201cYou are so certain that these foods will reach the mouth of the\u00a0Hereditary Prince?\u201dYang Cheng shifted his arms uneasily. His lips turned pale as he said, \u201cThat\u2019s what I was afraid of. Although I\u2019m greedy for wealth, I don\u2019t want to cause anyone to lose their lives.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Shen Zechuan cast a glance at Xiao Chiye and softened his tone at Yang Cheng, \u201cThis place may be the\u00a0imperial prison, but this is a case that is personally supervised and tried by His Majesty. If you have anything to say, you can voice them all out here.\u201dThe contrast between both of them was stark. Yang Cheng gulped down his saliva. He was already a little dazed from the non-stop interrogation all night. He muttered, \u201cI didn\u2019t know it. I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat didn\u2019t you know? Shen Zechuan asked gently.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that something would really happen to the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0of Libei\u2026\u201d Yang Cheng began to choke with sobs as he spoke. \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u2026 I was worried the Libei Armored Cavalry would suffer a defeat because of this and let the Biansha Cavalry assault their way in once again.\u201dXiao Chiye bent over slightly, his body like a vicious beast whose shadows loomed over Yang Cheng\u2019s face. He said in a frosty voice, \u201cSo you know this batch of military provisions can lead to the defeat of the Libei Armored Cavalry. Yet you still had them sealed and loaded up the carriages. You deserve to die.\u201dYang Cheng grew terrified under Xiao Chiye\u2019s gaze. Stumped for words, he cried incoherently, \u201cYour Lordship\u2026 I plead guilty. I, I deserve to die\u2026\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t die.\u201d With compassion brimming in his expressive, upturned eyes on his jade-like handsome face, Shen Zechuan said, \u201cThe main perpetrator is Wei Huaigu in this case. He used his position to coerce you, and there was nothing you could do. I understand these difficulties of yours. His Lordship understands it as well. Yang Cheng, you entered government service in the era of Yongyi. You have been an official in Juexi for half of your life, and you have made your way up to the post of Assistant Administration Commissioner. You are a capable man, as assessed from the\u00a0Qudu\u2019s inspection. Now that Jiang Qingshan has left Juexi to be transferred to Zhongbo as a provincial governor, the position of the Provincial Administration Commissioner of Juexi will be vacant. Going by age and experience, you will be the first choice for recommendation when the Ministry of Personnel is deliberating over it. You see, your future was supposed to be bright, and yet you forfeited it all for that bit of money. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201dHunching over, Yang Cheng sobbed.\u201cI heard that you were from Baimazhou in your early years. Your family was poor, and you lost your father at the age of six. Your siblings and you were single-handedly raised by your mother alone. She sent you and your brothers to school and spent most of her life enduring hardships. She finally waited for the day you became an official and had your own residence, yet you committed such a grave mistake.\u201d Shen Zechuan was particularly compassionate as he continued, \u201cFrom today onwards, she\u2019ll be left all alone and forsaken, and she still has to endure scorns and curses because of this case. How can you be so heartless?\u201dYang Cheng could not help himself and burst out crying. He was a scholar to begin with, and he knew of propriety, justice, integrity, and honor.1\u00a0He was the most filial in serving and attending to his mother\u2019s needs back at home. Covering his face with both hands, he cried, \u201cI have made such an inhumane mistake. I\u2019m too ashamed to see her again!\u201d\u201cThis case is still not closed. Whether you will be executed or not is still up for debate.\u201d Xiao Chiye threw down the confession and looked askance at him. \u201cSince you still know to be ashamed, then you still have a shred of conscience left. All the questions I\u2019m going to ask you next will not be recorded in the confession. If you answer truthfully, I\u2019ll think of a way to preserve your life so that your old mother may live her remaining years in peace and comfort. But if you dare to prevaricate in an attempt to fob me off, then I\u2019ll immediately have you publicly beheaded at the foot of Duancheng\u2019s city gate as a warning to the rest. With one relay report, you gave Wei Huaigu away and ruined many people\u2019s golden rice bowl.2\u00a0You are a man in the trade, so you understand best what fate awaits those widows and orphans. Without me to vouch for you, the lives of everyone in your family will be in imminent danger.\u201dYang Cheng cried for a long time. When he stopped, Shen Zechuan personally held out a cup of hot tea to him. He wiped his tears hastily and repeatedly said his thanks. With both hands holding the tea, he fell silent for a long while before he said, \u201cYour Lordship\u2019s willingness to protect me\u2026 is a great life-saving kindness. I don\u2019t dare to ask to re-enter government service as an official again; all I wish for is to be sent into exile. This case implicates way too much. It\u2019s not something that can be clearly explained in a short time. I\u2019ll tell Your Lordship about it slowly.\u201d\u201cEver since the first year of the era of Xiande, the state treasury has been depleting in substantial amounts. The Ministry of Revenue\u2019s accounts are all messed up. Hua Siqian, as the Grand Secretary of the Grand Secretariat, collaborated with Pan Rugui to approve many projects that squandered away public funds. For example, Linlang Garden in Qinzhou. Most of them weren\u2019t really built for real. These gardens were merely just a pretext to pass through the Grand Secretariat\u2019s examination and gain its approval so that everyone could draw out money from the state treasury together. The collusion between officials and merchants for illegal gains was something everyone in the palace knew. The money really flowed like water flowing into these people\u2019s pockets.\u201d\u201cIn the fourth year of Xiande, Wei Huaigu dragged me into this. I\u2019ll be honest, Your Lordship. I know these money shouldn\u2019t be touched, but I had no choice. When local officials like us enter the capital, the Pan and Hua factions will take turns to call on us and ask for \u2018ice respect\u2019. No doubt you would have also heard of the widely-spread practice of spending money to get a promotion those few years. The noble clans have the dignity of a noble clan to uphold. Those who are truly held back by all these \u2018ice respect\u2019 and \u2018coal respect\u20193\u00a0are officials from humble backgrounds like me. Without money, we can\u2019t enter the central administration. Without money, we won\u2019t have a job to do.\u201d\u201cThat year, Juexi faced a locust plague, and not a single grain was reaped from the thirteen cities. It was Jiang Qingshan who did all he could to shoulder this responsibility and save our lives. He forcibly opened up the commercial granaries to release food aid relief to the commoners, and this was how the situation did not deteriorate into a famine. It was also because of this that Jiang Qingshan became the thorn in the flesh of the prominent businessmen in Juexi.\u00a0Qudu\u00a0also knew this at that time. The debtors hunted him down to his residence, and his mother even had to weave fabrics to pay off the debt even at her age. But what debt was he repaying? We all know it very well that he was repaying the debt on behalf of the imperial court. But there was one thing that no one else but those of us from the Provincial Administration Commission of Juexi knew, and that was, the defeat of the Zhongbo troops was too timely.\u201d\u201cWhy do I say that? The state treasury was empty at that time, and Juexi had faced a calamity. Libei and Bianjun Commandery still had to deal with the Biansha Cavalry. The harvest of Hezhou further down was dismal too. People from the various areas were already starving to death at the beginning of the year. The Ministry of Revenue was forced into a corner, but they had no way to provide aid reliefs to the various areas because the state treasury had already been emptied out. Hua Siqian had to give the various regions an explanation, and Hai Liangyi of the Grand Secretariat was also looking into the accounts. In no time, Hua Siqian was caught between a rock and a hard place. This matter put him in a terrible fix. At that time, the Hua Clan in Dicheng sold their manor, and it was the Xi Clan who took over. We all know that Hua Siqian wanted to backfill the state treasury by doing this; he wanted to cover up the matter. But a vacuum of that size was not something he alone can fill in, and so, Hua Siqian began to collect his debt from the others.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if Hua Siqian got his money back. But it was at this juncture that the Biansha Cavalry suddenly launched an assault at Chashi River. Duanzhou\u2019s garrison troops suffered a crushing defeat, and Shen Wei withdrew and holed himself up like a tortoise, leading to Zhongbo\u2019s defeat one after another. Libei Armored Cavalry and Qidong Garrison Troops came from both sides to provide reinforcements. It was at the gate of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0that they stopped the Biansha Tribes from penetrating deeper. But although the homeland was reclaimed, the massacred cities had already turned into deserted ones. And Juexi\u2019s subsequent resupply of relief grains were precisely the grains of the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo.\u201dShen Zechuan abruptly rose to his feet. He stood in the darkness without saying a word.Xiao Chiye\u2019s heart went icy as well. He and Shen Zechuan had made so many assumptions in the past, but it had never occurred to them that the defeat of the Zhongbo troops might be to fill up the empty granaries at the back and pay off the debt for Hua Siqian and the officials who were caught in a difficult position owing to the state treasury investigation.\u201cThat was more than 100,000 people.\u201d Shen Zechuan stupefyingly supported himself on the table and looked ahead as he said in a hoarse voice, \u201cThat was\u2026 That was the lives of 40,000 soldiers\u2026 Do you know what you are talking about\u2026\u201dShen Zechuan was caught off-guard by these words. He spent six years convincing himself that these people possibly died in the struggle for power. These vivacious people, these young lives\u2014all of them existed once, like Ji Mu. Duanzhou was the first door in. They all died so tragically. The singing reverberating in Chashi sinkhole was Shen Zechuan\u2019s nightmare for a lifetime.The defeat of Zhongbo troops led to countless of victims. No one went to collect the bodies of the soldiers who died in battle. Blood inundated the dreams of survivors.In this oppressive atmosphere, Yang Cheng held his head and said, \u201cThe filling of military grains this time really made me afraid. Zhongbo still had the chance to be rescued, but Libei can only rely on the reinforcement from Luoxia Pass. Once the Biansha Cavalry breaches Libei, I\u2019ll become a sinner condemned through the ages!\u201d\u201cThe defeat of Zhongbo troops and the arrival of the Biansha Cavalry were too coincidental! Hanshe Tribe\u2019s transfer of their troops south was not a coincidence; it was because they received news.\u201dIn that case, Hanshe Tribe\u2019s encounter with Xiao Jiming at the Hongyan eastern mountain range this time was definitely no coincidence either. There were people everywhere in\u00a0Qudu, Zhongbo, Libei, and even Qidong, to pass information to the Twelve Tribes of Biansha. They raise the Twelve Tribes of Biansha like they were raising a jackal so starving it would lap up everything. And when necessary, they would let it into the territory to gobble up all the traces that could not be wiped clean.\u201cI don\u2019t know if there is anyone else in the central administration who is still doing such a thing.\u201d Yang Cheng said fearfully. \u201cBut it\u2019s really a close call this time\u2026 There are already reserves in the state treasury, and the Grand Secretariat is also carrying out stringent audits on the Ministry of Revenue\u2019s accounts. It\u2019d be selling out the state if the Biansha Cavalry is released into our territory again. I don\u2019t know\u2026 I don\u2019t dare to bet on it. There are people monitoring my private correspondences, so I could only inform\u00a0Qudu\u00a0through the relay report!\u201d\u201cSince you want to report Wei Huaigu\u2026\u201d Shen Zechuan suddenly lifted up Yang Cheng. \u201cWhy did you affix it with the Ministry of Revenue\u2019s tag when you sent out the urgent relay report? The very first moment this report enters\u00a0Qudu, it would land in Wei Huaigu\u2019s hands!\u201dYang Cheng lost his grip on the teacup. Under the sound of the porcelain cup shattering, he said in a trembling voice, \u201cNo, no! I had it affixed with the Ministry of Justice\u2019s tag!\u201dShen Zechuan was stunned.Looking fearful, Yang Cheng said in disbelief, \u201cI\u2019d no doubt die if this report were to land in Wei Huaigu\u2019s hands! I know that the Minister of Justice, Kong Qiu, is a courageous one. He isn\u2019t born from a noble clan, so he will definitely not put it off or cover it up for Wei Huaigu. That\u2019s why I triple-checked before dispatching it that it was the Ministry of Justice I tagged!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been had.\u201d Xiao Chiye grasped hold of Shen Zechuan in support. The expression in his eyes was ruthless. \u201cWei Huaigu isn\u2019t the culprit this time. When Wei Huaigu received the relay report, he knew that someone had already read the content. This was a silent coercion\u2014he\u00a0had to turn himself in!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 : MansionWei Huaigu, who was over 50 years old, was stripped of his official robes, thereby turning into a prisoner in white.1\u00a0He was shackled, with iron bars separating him and Xiao Chiye. No one had ever maltreated him these few days he had been put on trial. His hair, which had been tied up in a bun, was tidy, and his face was clean. It was just that he seemed to have aged by several years in a few short days. He looked very haggard.\u201cThe trial ended last night.\u201d Wei Huaigu sat on the chair and said to both of them. \u201cMy confession has already been submitted, and I\u2019m now waiting to be sentenced. What else do you want to ask?\u201d\u201cEmbezzlement of state treasury funds, resale of military provisions for illegal gains, and the poisoning of the generals at the frontier\u2014all three charges are capital crimes.\u201d Xiao Chiye looked closely at Wei Huaigu. \u201cWei Huaixing has also been removed from his post and thrown into prison to await the impeachment order. The fall of your Wei Clan\u2019s line of direct descendants took out two imperial court ministers along with it. How is it that you could bear to let it happen this time?\u201d\u201cThis matter concerns Libei. Who would dare to bend the law and play favorites? There\u2019s no one to protect me.\u201d Wei Huaigu adjusted his sitting posture as if he was still sitting in the main seat at the Ministry of Revenue\u2019s office compound. He looked at Xiao Chiye, \u201cYour father has now come out of obscurity to take up the mantle. His Majesty probably won\u2019t even dare to sleep these few days. The Prince of Libei is still the same tough nut as he was back in those days. He knows what to do to give them a rap on the knuckles.\u201d\u201cYou should have known that those military provisions were to be delivered to Libei when you were filling the military provisions up with moldy grains. But you still did it all the same, didn\u2019t you? At that time, you weren\u2019t the slightest bit afraid that there\u2019s no one protecting you.\u201d Xiao Chiye shifted a little and continued, \u201cTo send these things into my eldest brother\u2019s mouth, adulterating it was only the first step. When the grains arrived at Libei, you bribed the officials in charge of examining the granary so that they would close an eye and send the stuff to the camps. This was the second step. Then you bribed the mess cooks of the Libei Armored Cavalry and mixed this poisonous stuff into the dishes before they were sent to the soldiers at the frontier pass for consumption. This was the third step.\u201dXiao Chiye stopped and looked out of the corner of his eyes at Wei Huaigu.\u201cThese arrangements take time and effort. The moment an accident happens, you won\u2019t be able to deny your involvement in it. Not only will you not get away with it, you\u2019ll even be subjected to a probe by the Ministry of Justice, which will bring your crime of reselling military provisions for profits to light. You are not this kind of person.\u201dWei Huaigu did not answer Xiao Chiye\u2019s question immediately. Instead, he looked at Shen Zechuan, who had been sitting behind Xiao Chiye all this while. He laughed and pointed at Shen Zechuan, saying, \u201cSecond Young Master has made progress, having been in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0for six years. Back then, when you first entered the capital, you spent the whole day looking for fights and braying for blood. Vice Commander Shen knows this from experience, right? That\u2019s why I said Xiao Fangxu is an iron fist to dare to put his son on the edge of the blade to polish. You really have your father to thank for being able to grow into the person you are now.\u201dXiao Chiye looked at Wei Huaigu with indifference. It was unexpectedly Shen Zechuan who pushed aside the confession statement. With both hands slightly clasped together on the table, he said calmly to Wei Huaigu without so much a smile or wrath, \u201cThat\u2019s right. You find it unfair to see such a Xiao Ce\u2019an. Your son spent all day mixing with the brothel crowd during the years of Xiande. By the time the Grand Secretariat had a change of personnel in the reign of Tianchen, it would have been insurmountably hard for him to enter officialdom through the imperial examinations even if he wanted to.2\u00a0You are already at this age. Yet the Wei clan does not have a descendant of direct lineage who is capable of keeping the Wei clan going. You placed your hopes on a marriage alliance, but a pity the Fei clan knows that the Wei clan is on the decline, and Commandery Princess Zhaoyue eventually married into the Pan clan. In your post as the Minister of Revenue, you\u2019ve repeatedly demoted and relegated newly appointed officials to remote areas. What you fear was being replaced by the up-and-coming talents. Today, the Wei clan seemed to be still at the height of its power, but in truth, it is already water that is about to spill over\u2014With your death, the Wei clan is doomed to fall.\u201dTouching his shackles, Wei Huaigu said, \u201cThe power of a clan is like the tides, whose rise and fall is a fact of the world. It thrives one moment and declines the next. All of it are predestined. There\u2019s nothing for me to regret when the time comes for the Wei clan. History has gone through several generation changes for as long as Dazhou has existed to this day. Everything is ever-changing; only the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0have not changed. Therefore, it\u2019s only with my death that the Wei clan can survive.\u201d\u201cWill the\u00a0Eight Great Clans\u00a0really remain unchanged?\u201d\u00a0Xiao\u00a0Chiye said. \u201cThe internal strife between the Xi brothers led to the end of all their\u00a0di\u00a0and\u00a0shu\u00a0descendants. There is already no one left today to carry on the bloodline. In the future, the Xi clan will no longer be the Xi clan it used to be. It\u2019s only a matter of time before they are squeezed out of the political game.\u201dBut Wei Huaigu laughed it off and said, \u201cAs long as the Xi clan still exists, they won\u2019t be booted out of the game. Today, you kill Xi Hongxuan, wanting to cut up the Xi clan\u2019s family fortune, yet you can\u2019t bear to give up the Xi clan\u2019s businesses, so you still have to continue to rely on others to put things in order for you. So tell me, is the Xi clan still considered dead then? They merely lost a helmsman at the head. This is a temporary predicament. As long as that eldest madam of theirs still wants to control the business under Xi\u2019s name, then when she finds a new flame in the future, the other party can only marry into the family3\u00a0and change his surname. The child they bear will still take on the surname Xi. And this, is a new direct line of descendants that will continue the Xi clan\u2019s lineage.\u201dCandle wax dripped, like tears mottling the sides of it. Night was coming to an end. Silence reigned on the outside. Wei Huaigu stood up, like an elder guiding intellectual discussions.\u201cI have a question. I have always wanted to ask Xiao Fangxu, but there is no more chance for me to now, so I can only ask you. Xiao Chiye, your father came from a humble background. He experienced hardship at the frontier before he finally tided over the sea of suffering to possess his own turf and title. You call yourselves people who broke the shackles of the noble clans. But it has been thirty years now, and Libei and the Xiao clan have become a single inseparable entity. He came to have sons too. You and Xiao Jiming are both legitimate sons born of the principal wife. To avoid disputes between the son of lawful births born of the principal wives and son of common births born of concubines, he even refused to remarry4\u00a0or get a concubine. He turned Xiao Jiming and you into the only choices to lead the Libei Armored Cavalry. Isn\u2019t this precisely the impenetrable fortress built as a safeguard at the inception of a noble clan? You are now walking the same exact path as us.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cYou think this way because you don\u2019t understand that there are people in this world willing to be tied down by love. My father doesn\u2019t remarry or take a concubine simply because he is only willing to exchange lifetime vows of conjugal bliss with my mother in this life of his. Libei Armored Cavalry is a heavy cavalry5\u00a0he established. He understands this army better than anyone else. This is his third son, one that is far more important than my eldest brother and me. All along, the ones who have been seeing my eldest brother and me as the only choices for Libei Armored Cavalry are you people. My being in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0doesn\u2019t tether the Libei Armored Cavalry at all, only Xiao Fangxu and Xiao Jiming. You still have not understood one thing. My father has indeed set up an impenetrable fortress around the position of the Libei Armored Cavalry\u2019s commander-in-chief. But that is not a bastion of iron to safeguard the status of a noble clan. Rather, it is a weight \u2013 a test \u2013 of whether one can truly become the chief commander of an army to lead Libei Armored Cavalry into bearing the ravages of the elements against the fortress amidst those ceaseless confrontations with Biansha. Thirty years ago, Xiao Fangxu was the man who broke through this layer of fortress. Ten years ago, the one who did the same was Xiao Jiming. If someday, someone is similarly able to break through this layer of fortress, has no fear of hardships and suffering, and is willing to be forged and tempered in such a way, then, he shall be the new commander-in-chief of the Libei Armored Cavalry.\u201d\u201cYou made it out to be all so honorable and dignified for Xiao Fangxu, but in reality, the Xiao clan has been monopolizing the military power of Libei all these years.\u201d The expression in Wei Huaigu\u2019s eye was slightly mocking.\u201cThat\u2019s just because the two men who have borne such a weight one after another happen to be surnamed Xiao.\u201d Xiao Chiye\u2019s eyes suddenly revealed a brilliance that made it hard for one to look right at him in the eyes. In the dimness of this fading light, he was both Xiao Fangxu and Xiao Jiming, as well as the pride the three men of the Xiao clan had hidden deep under their armors. He said, \u201cYou people called my father an alpha wolf. There are no prejudices against one\u2019s blood lineage in a pack of wolves. As long as you can defeat us., you can lead us. Everything the Libei Armored Cavalry has to show for today is what it deserves. Someday\u2014\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s voice came to a stop.But Shen Zechuan knew what he was going to say next. He wanted to say that someday when he returned to Libei, he would also participate in such a fight amongst the wolves. As long as he could defeat the others, he would be the third alpha wolf. The source of their pride and willfulness was that they had never feared resistance. This was Xiao Fangxu\u2019s soul, and he taught this kind of spirit to both of his sons, as well as the Libei Armored Cavalry.\u201cDo you know why the Qi clan, who similarly guards the frontier and who holds military power firmly in their hands, has never faced such animosity from the noble clans as the Xiao clan did?\u201d Wei Huaigu and Xiao Chiye looked at each other. He said mildly, \u201cBecause you were all born with a rebellious bone. This pride is precisely the root cause of\u00a0Qudu\u2019s distrust of Libei. And do you know why the noble clans would not fall? Because we know to go with the flow and seize the opportunities presented to us. The Li clan is the root \u2013 the foundation \u2013 of Dazhou. We surround it, see it born, let it grow. We alternate with one another, and we give each other. We are the soil that sustains Dazhou. The land you step on under your feet, and the sky you look at when you raise your head\u2014they are the stability that arises as a result of the noble clans holding together. All those who want to break such a stability are enemies. Twenty-six years ago, the Crown Prince of the Li clan led the eastern palace in an attempt to break the status quo. That was na\u00efve. The Crown Prince didn\u2019t understand that once the noble clans collapsed, the Li clan would rapidly wither too. That was why he was sure to die.\u201d\u201cHua Siqian may die, as may Xi Hongxuan. Same goes for me. But it\u2019s just our bodies that perish. The noble clan is not a world that can be overthrown by human power alone. Nobody, and I mean nobody, can defeat us. All these years, the only scholar of a humble background in the imperial court who truly broke through the siege to endanger us all is Hai Liangyi. He used close to thirty years to lie low in patience. He has made his way up now, but does he dare to turn the world upside down without careful consideration? He rejuvenated the Imperial College and promoted scholars of humble backgrounds. Every step he takes is that careful and cautious, because he knows the outcome of using brute force to tussle will be the ruin of the empire. But how long can he still live? After his death, this phase will crumble and fall apart. It\u2019s impossible for him to succeed.\u201d Wei Huaigu suddenly burst out laughing. He held on to the bars and looked at Shen Zechuan. \u201cQi Huilian led the eastern palace to act with haste and resolve. He would never let us off easily. He thought he could do it, but he ended up causing the death of the Crown Prince. All the geniuses in this world should learn to reflect on their shortcomings. He is a cautionary tale of political radicalism.\u201d\u201cStop him!\u201d Shen Zechuan suddenly rose.Xiao Chiye immediately reached out, but it was already too late. Wei Huaigu started to cough violently. He bent over, cupping the blood in his hands, and lifted his eyes to look at both of them. Amidst his intense pain and with blood in his mouth, he said,\u201cYou can\u2019t win\u2026 You are doomed\u2026 doomed to fail!\u201dXiao Chiye kicked the cell door open, hauled Wei Huaigu up, and pinched his mouth open. The filthy blood within trickled down. Wei Huaigu was just like the expiring candle in the wind. His limbs gradually stiffened amidst his convulsions, until he finally stopped moving, his eyes still open in a glare.The flame of the candle went out. Only the whimpers of the wind could be heard inside the prison.\u201cThe imperial heir!\u201d Xiao Chiye let go of the corpse and strode out.The sky was brightening up a little outside, although it was still shrouded with dense, dark clouds. The rainstorm that had stopped seemed as if it was about to stage a comeback. Oppressiveness pervaded the air along with the sounds of chaotic footsteps. Xiao Chiye pushed the door open and saw the panic-stricken girls in the prison. The stench of blood came assailing their nostrils. All the boys had been killed, their bodies lying haphazardly on the ground. Sweat formed on Xiao Chiye\u2019s temples. He clutched\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0as his eyes swept across each of these terrified faces.He and Shen Zechuan had not made their moves yet. So who killed the imperial heir?Cool wind blew against Xiao Chiye\u2019s soaked back. He had yet to turn around when he heard the gallops of a horse.Amidst the jolts and bumps, Fuman shouted in a fluster, \u201cYour, Your Lordship! Please head into the palace quickly! His Majesty is in imminent danger!\u201dXiao Chiye abruptly turned back, but Shen Zechuan pressed his hand down on Xiao Chiye\u2019s arm. He was so calm that his gaze made Fuman\u2019s limbs tremble. He asked, \u201cWhat do you mean by imminent danger? Make yourself clear.\u201dWith snot and tears running down his face, Fuman cried, \u201cHis Majesty is critically ill. He is urgently summoning His Lordship over for an audience with him. There is an important matter he wishes to entrust to His Lordship!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 : CollapseThe sky\u2019s overcast foreshadowed the incoming rainstorm.Xiao Chiye took off\u00a0Langli Blade\u00a0by the palace entrance and stepped into the dark and long hallway. Eunuchs kneeling on either side all kept quiet with their heads lowered. Silence befell in and outside of Mingli Hall. With scuttling steps, Fuman led Xiao Chiye to the door and lifted the curtains. The bed curtains within the bedchamber were not drawn up. There was a suffocating heat inside, mixed with a hint of blood.Fuman whispered between sobs, \u201cYour Majesty, look. His Lordship is here!\u201dLi Jianheng answered from within and said, \u201cTell the rest to take their leave. I want to speak with the marquis before the Secretariat Elder arrives. Do not disturb us.\u201dFuman quietly exited with the other servants.\u201cCe\u2019an.\u201d Li Jianheng seemed to have shifted his body. He said, \u201cPull the bed curtains open.\u201dXiao Chiye raised his hand and pulled the hanging curtains back. The bed was stained all over with blood. Li Jianheng looked as if he was soaking in a pool of filthy color. His chest heaved as he struggled to gasp for breath.\u201cBrother.\u201d Li Jianheng\u2019s pale face was full of tears and sweat. He wiped off the sweat with his trembling hand, but smeared his entire face with blood instead, \u201cWhere the heck have you been? The anxiety is killing me.\u201dMu Ru was lying beside Li Jianheng. Dead.Xiao Chiye suddenly felt a little lonesome. Even though he knew this meeting was a trap, he still agreed to this invitation just to live up to this word of \u201cbrother\u201d from Li Jianheng. The brotherhood of their reckless youth was already crushed and shattered to smithereens under the unforgiving wheel of power; yet in this moment, it seemed as though it was glued back together again. He felt as if he had returned to the past. He hung up the curtains and said in a raspy voice, \u201cIt was very windy on the way here, and there were too many people on Shenwu Street, which made it inconvenient to ride a horse.\u201dLi Jianheng raised the hand that was covering up his wound and looked at where he was stabbed. He said, \u201cYou have been a good brother to me. You clearly knew this trip was dangerous, yet you still came. It is not in vain that I, Li Jianheng, could be buddies with you.\u201dXiao Chiye pulled over a chair to sit down and looked at Li Jianheng as his Adam\u2019s apple bobbed several times. He said, \u201cI had already told you a long time back that she was not a good match for you.\u201d\u201cBut I liked her so much,\u201d Li Jianheng blankly rubbed the blood between his fingers. \u201cI thought she liked me too. Fuck\u2026 so this is how much it hurts to be stabbed with a knife.\u201dXiao Chiye rubbed his face and propped his elbows on his knees. He said, \u201cWhat did you want to tell me now that you have called me over?\u201dLi Jianheng turned his eyes and chuckled at Xiao Chiye through his tears before his face fell again. Choking with sobs, he said with a broken voice, \u201cI called for you, so you came. The fuck is wrong with you, Xiao Ce\u2019an. Do you know that it\u2019s full of people out there\u2026 waiting for you with swords in their hands?\u201dJust like Xiao Chiye had done when he was resolving tough situations for him in the past, he calmly nodded and said, \u201cI know.\u201dLi Jianheng forced down a sob and said, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t come, I\u2019d not have to apologize.\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s eyes reddened. He said, \u201cYou are the emperor. There is no need for the emperor to apologize.\u201dLi Jianheng covered his wound and bawled his eyes out while shaking his head. He sobbed, \u201cI\u2026 Brother\u2026 I really\u2026 wanted to be a good emperor. I even memorized the texts a few days ago. Tell this to the Secretariat Elder on my behalf when you head out.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cYou are the emperor. Tell him yourself.\u201dGasping and crying in a hoarse voice, Li Jianheng said, \u201cThat won\u2019t do. I\u2019m the emperor; I cannot go myself. It\u2019s too humiliating. He is a loyal subject. Tell me, why am I this, this stupid? I, really wanted to call him my second father.1\u00a0I\u2019m scared, scared that after I die, both of you will also end up stabbed by the others.\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s voice turned raspy as he answered, \u201cHow are you going to leave when you are such a scaredy-cat?\u201dLi Jianheng gestured, \u201cImperial Brother is waiting for me. I\u2019m scared that he\u2019s going to scold me again. I\u2019ve let him down.\u201dXiao Chiye snorted a laugh and said, \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ve got?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Li Jianheng\u2019s breath grew rapid. He pursed his parched lips again and again, then said, \u201cI\u2019ve let you down too. I\u2019ve not stuck by you enough. We are both in situations that we have control over. I really\u2026 really regret it. Ce\u2019an, leave. When you get outside, just go. Get on your horse and go home. I have nothing to give you, but it\u2019s also a shame not to gift you anything.\u201dXiao Chiye rubbed his face again.Li Jianheng raised a finger and pointed toward the wall. He muttered indistinctly, \u201cThat\u2026 that bow, is what you helped me obtain from Imperial Brother. But fuck, I-I can\u2019t pull it\u2026 Take it with you. The wolf pup should stay\u2026 stay in the grasslands. That thumb ring of yours must be rusted by now.\u201dXiao Chiye said heartlessly, \u201cI don\u2019t want it. That\u2019s the Conqueror Bow of your clan.\u201d\u201cYou are the conqueror\u2026\u201d Li Jianheng\u2019s voice was already very soft. He gazed at the bow. \u201cIn my next life\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t make me the emperor again\u2026 I want to be a swallow of Dazhou\u2026 nesting under the roof of riches and glory\u2026\u201dHe looked quietly at the Conqueror Bow and did not move anymore.The wind blew against the drapes in the bedchamber. Sitting, Xiao Chiye listened as that muffled thunder struck and torrential rain exploded forth.Han Cheng finished up the last mouthful of tea and held the teacup in his hands as he walked out of the door to look at the Eight Great Training Divisions\u2019 soldiers who were standing by in combat readiness. He flung the teacup onto the ground and boomed at the top of his voice, \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0only has eight thousand people. Without receiving news, the men at Mount Feng military grounds can\u2019t come to provide reinforcement. Xiao Chiye is already a trapped beast in a cage. Today, we must take him down!\u201dHeavy rain rumbled. The sound of densely clustered footsteps surrounded the imperial palace like layers of walls. Sheaths of blades scraped against armors as the Eight Great Training Divisions laid a heavy siege outside the bedchamber. Fuman could no longer stand up as he listened to those sounds. The eunuchs each cowered in the corners, lest they were taken to be sacrificed to these swords.Xiao Chiye finally stood up. Under the intersection of light and shadows, he put down the bed curtains for Li Jianheng. Then he turned around to take down the Conqueror Bow that weighed a hundred\u00a0catty.2\u00a0The doors had long been opened. Xiao Chiye pushed aside layers upon layers of fluttering drapery and walked towards the heavy rain without so much a look back.Han Cheng led the men into drawing their blades. There was nothing for him to shout, because they had already won. They wanted to change the world in this heavy bout of downpour and make Xiao Chiye kneel once more.Xiao Chiye looked at those dark and dense masses of heads. He strode a step out and walked down along the long stairs. He had no blade. When the rainwater wiped off his indifference, he was already clashing with that group of people. He held out the Conqueror Bow horizontally to intercept the blades, then pushed back against the wall of people into a retreat with an unrelenting, indomitable aura that suppressed the roar of the torrential rain.Shen Zechuan spurred his horse across the street, with the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0and\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0behind him like a red serpent as they crashed through the palace gates under the flashes and glints of their blades and galloped their way within.The entire palace was already surrounded by armors. Pandemonium broke loose as the sound of fighting and killing at close quarters filled the air. The influx of horses sped up the fighting. Ignoring the sea of people,\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0charged right for Xiao Chiye. Xiao Chiye used the momentary opening to flip atop the horse and caught hold of\u00a0Langli Blade, which Shen Zechuan had tossed over.Xiao Chiye suddenly drew his blade and said, \u201cQudu\u00a0is not the hometown in my dreams. I\u2019m going home today. Whoever dares to stand in my way\u2014I\u2019ll kill him!\u201dWith that, he clamped the horse tightly with his legs and drew blood with a brandish of his blade.With the torrential rain pouring down on them, Xiao Chiye forcibly killed a bloody path out. The battlefield retreated from the palace interior to the streets. Seeing as the situation did not look good, Han Cheng hurriedly shouted, \u201cGuard the city gate to the death. We mustn\u2019t let this vile spawn who killed the sovereign and plotted a rebellion leave tonight!\u201dHow was the Eight Great Training Divisions the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s match? Even if they had many men, they were still afraid to death as the master of these wolves and tigers forced them back into a retreat. The city gate had long been shut. Shen Zechuan held his blade and went up the city wall first. He kicked over the obstructions in his way and told his men to open the city gate. That tightly shut gate lifted with a rumble. Beyond that curtain of rain was the home Xiao Chiye had been longing for for six years.Han Cheng turned back and shouted, \u201cHurry and bring him over!\u201dXiao Chiye\u2019s horse had already galloped out of the city. He raised a hand to motion to Ding Tao to take the men and rush towards the military grounds at Mount Feng; they had to take these 20,000 men from the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0away with them. He turned his horse around among the crowd of people and opened up his arms to Shen Zechuan, who was at the top of the city wall, and said to him in a deep, somber voice, \u201cLanzhou, come with me!\u201dBut the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0stood tall and still. In the heavy rain, Shen Zechuan held on to the battlement of the wall and gazed at Xiao Chiye as if he wanted to get a full, clear look at him.The Eight Great Training Divisions had swarmed up again and were about to pursue their way out of the city gate. That highly suspended city gate let out a muffled groan, as if it could not hold up to gravitational force. Iron chains swiftly recoiled, and the city gate went crashing down with a thunderous bang.\u201cCe\u2019an.\u201d Shen Zechuan raised his voice and said gently to him through the heavy rain. \u201cGo home.\u201dXiao Chiye felt as though his heart had been dunked in icy water. He clenched the reins tightly, already spurring his horse back. The city gate slammed onto the ground with a \u201cthud\u201d, completely cutting off the path of the pursuing soldiers from the Eight Great Training Divisions, keeping them within the city, and also completely shutting Xiao Chiye out on the other side of the gate.Xiao Chiye shouted himself hoarse, as if he was a beast that had been enraged, \u201cShen Lanzhou!\u201dShen Zechuan did not look at Xiao Chiye again. Instead, he turned around to look at Han Cheng and that densely packed troop of soldiers.Han Cheng turned his head and spat out a mouthful of saliva. He said in a ferocious voice, \u201cShen Zechuan, you\u2019ve ruined things for me!\u201d\u201cYou think you are worthy to call yourself an Imperial Bodyguard?\u201d Shen Zechuan looked down on him and said in a frosty voice, \u201cSince Ji Wufan, the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0have always been heroes of indomitable spirits and clear consciences. You people lay a trap and conspire to murder the\u00a0Son of Heaven. Han Cheng, it\u2019s entirely justified for me to kill you!\u201dHan Cheng threw his head back and laughed out loud. He said, \u201cWhat are you? The last evil remnant of the Shen Clan! I treated you well, having guided and supported you many times, and this is how you repay me? Here! Bring the man over and show him to Vice Commander Shen!\u201dA disheveled Qi Huilian was dragged out. He fell into the rainwater and cursed, \u201cTreacherous traitor!\u201dYanking at the chain, Han Cheng spurred the horse forward and dragged Qi Huilian through the streets. He pointed at Qi Huilian and said to Shen Zechuan, \u201cHaven\u2019t you been looking for him for a long time? He\u2019s here! Shen Zechuan, come and get him!\u201d\u201cTraitor, traitor!\u201d Qi Huilian was boiling with fury as the dragging smeared his face with muddy water.Han Cheng looked at Shen Zechuan\u2019s pale face, then at the dark expression in his eyes. He said, \u201cYour eldest brother is the\u00a0Hereditary Prince\u00a0of Jianxing, I remember that the Biansha Cavalry dragged him to his death alive. But there is no love lost between you both, so you weren\u2019t hurt by it at all. Are you hurting now that it\u2019s your teacher\u2019s turn today?\u201d\u201cHan Cheng!\u201d Shen Zechuan spat out Han Cheng\u2019s name through clenched teeth, \u201cYou went to such trouble to hide Teacher in your hands. What do you want?\u201d\u201cHe was initially of great use!\u201d Han Cheng suddenly turned hostile, \u201cBut you let Xiao Chiye go and ruined the trap I set. As such, you\u2019re no longer of use, and neither is he! If you still want him to live, then kowtow to me and admit your mistakes! Kneel and call me \u2018father\u2019 loudly three times, and I\u2019ll spare him, and you as well!\u201dShen Zechuan strode a big step forward and said, \u201cDeal!\u201d\u201cBollocks!\u201d Qi Huilian raised his head from the muddy water. He wiped off the filth and climbed to his feet. Staring at Shen Zechuan, he said, \u201cThe reason I taught you the classics was not for you to allow yourself to be humiliated by anyone! I, Qi Huilian, will not even bow down to heaven and earth. So how can you kneel to a despicable scum?!\u201dThe metal shackles clanked and clattered.Qi Huilian stumbled and shouted at the top of his lungs amidst the rain, \u201cHundreds of years have passed like a dream,3\u00a0and I still come and go as I wish! I have lived a life of wealth and glory, of fame and fortune, and I\u2014\u201d He laughed maniacally as he tugged at the chains around his neck. \u201cI have laughed at all the heroic figures throughout the land, and there is not another talent who surpasses me in the world! Who is there who can be compared to me, Qi Huilian? I am the world-renowned triple-yuan4\u00a0top scholar from Yuzhou! When I conversed in His Majesty\u2019s presence and counseled His Majesty on state affairs\u2014oh, Han Cheng, where were you? You were just a vermin in the ditch!\u201dIt was as if Qi Huilian was intoxicated as he soaked in the rain.\u201cYou vermins are unworthy of even carrying my shoes! The noble clans are like the rotten boils of this land. Tell Hai Liangyi that Dazhou is already beyond cure. He and I are both too powerless to turn the situation around!\u201d Qi Huilian arrogantly turned around amid the sound of his laughter and spat at Han Cheng. He said, \u201cBut I will not admit defeat. I will only serve as the Imperial Preceptor in this life! Lanzhou! The cage is now broken, and the world will rise in turbulent chaos. I have taught you all that I could teach you. This decaying world\u2026.\u201dWith his back to Shen Zechuan, Qi Huilian suddenly choked with sobs. The downpour drenched his body through and through, but it could not douse his ideals and passion that had been blazing for years. In the past, he was always calling out for the crown prince, yet, at this moment, he could not bear to look back at Shen Zechuan.\u201cWhy not overturn this decaying empire and go create a world you can call yours. Lanzhou, go. Don\u2019t look back. Teacher shall shoulder the burden of these 40,000 souls who have died unjust death on your behalf. Don\u2019t be afraid. Have\u2014\u201d His blood spattered in the rain, and he fell over on his back. Gazing at the sky, he murmured, \u201cHave no fear.\u201dA sudden clap of thunder erupted. Shen Zechuan cried out involuntarily and fell to his knees. He stared blankly in a daze, giving the heavy rain free rein to land blows on him. In that endless silence, his mask was utterly torn to pieces. He finally let out the first howl of despair in six years. There was already no more sanity left in those reddened eyes of him. He clenched Yang Shen Xue and suddenly drew his blade.\u201cHan Cheng\u2014!\u201dHe hated this empire to death. He also loathed these faces to death.Shen Zechuan propped himself up from the ground. Yang Shen Xue slashed through the droplets of rain and flung out blood from among this heavy siege. He killed one, then killed another. He strode across those bodies, yet he seemed like a beast that had been abandoned. His blade sliced across throats, so swift that it seemed like a stream of mercury. Blood sprayed over half of Shen Zechuan\u2019s face.He was beside himself. The blood trickled like tears across his cheek.Retreating again and again, Han Cheng bellowed, \u201cKill him!\u201dThe raindrops in the wind suddenly burst apart. In the blink of an eye, a long arrow had reached right before Han Cheng. Xiao Chiye leaped down from atop the city wall along the iron chain, kicked down a man, and flipped his hand over to draw his blade and stab it through the other party. With the corpse falling onto him, he moved swiftly and struck away the flashes of blades. When he extracted the blade, blood had already soaked both of his palm.Xiao Chiye dragged Shen Zechuan back with one arm and whistled. Meng spread its wings and pounced. In the chaos, it pecked Han Cheng\u2019s right eye, injuring it. Han Cheng hastily covered his face in a panic. He heard the waves of horse hooves beyond the city; Ding Tao had already brought the men over in a swift charge forth.\u201cBreak down the gate!\u201d Ding Tao shouted himself hoarse.The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0swept forth, but before they could take any action, they heard that city gate let out a dull, thunderous noise again as it was slowly hoisted up.Dragging the iron chain, Fei Sheng gasped heavily a few times and led the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0to draw back with all their might. He cussed, \u201cFuck! Son of a bitch is so heavy, doggone it! Your Lordship\u2014Get on your horse and run!\u201dLang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0swiftly galloped in from the opening. Sounds of killing and shouts engulfed\u00a0Qudu.Thunderous sounds of killing and shouts similarly reverberated through the Bianjun Commandery, which was also engaged in a life-and-death battle. Lu Guangbai could barely lift his spear now. As he withdrew, he shouted, \u201cWhere are the reinforcements?!\u201dThe deputy general, who had received several stabs and slashes himself, answered, \u201cThey\u2026 didn\u2019t come.\u201dThe rain howled. Lu Guangbai looked back in the direction of the camp.Xiao Chiye had already gotten on his horse. He pressed Shen Zechuan to his chest before him and broke through the heavy rain towards the city gate.Lightning flashed, and thunder boomed. A rift seemed to have been torn open in the sky. The rain poured mercilessly down.Lu Guangbai ripped off his tattered cloak and nailed the spear into the ground by his feet. He said over the sandstorm and rainstorm, \u201cWe can\u2019t fight on anymore.\u201dThe deputy general lay at the side of the sand slope and looked at him.\u201cFate wants to bind me here for life, but this is not the path I choose.\u201d Lu Guangbai took off the armor with Dazhou with Dazhou\u2019s imprint on it. He wiped the wind and frost5\u00a0off his face, and his eyes spoke of worldly weariness as he said a little self-mockingly, \u201cThe yellow dust6\u00a0submerged my brothers deep under. I no longer have a wish to bow in submission to an illusory fate. The imperial edict can\u2019t save my troops, and the imperial court can\u2019t fill the stomachs of my mounts.\u201dXiao Chiye had already galloped his way out of\u00a0Qudu, with countless soldiers in pursuit behind him. They charged ahead, as if tearing apart the dark, rainy sky.\u201cI\u2019m no longer willing to lay down my life for this purpose.\u201dLu Guangbai closed both of his eyes. Watery blood trickled along his fingers and dripped onto the yellow sands. His Adam\u2019s apple bobbed. When he finally opened his eyes, there was darkness in them.The blood on Shen Zechuan\u2019s cheek was washed away. Grieved sobs escaped his throat. He had already forsaken all of his past submissive obedience in this sorry escape. Like a sharp sword, they pierced through the heavy rain.Lu Guangbai washed both of his hands clean in the rain and held up his long spear once again.They were all prisoners pursued by fate. They were once willing to be shackled. But the rainstorm toppled over the great mansion, and its collapsed debris came assaulting towards them like a deluge of floodwater.7Onward, onward!\u201cI want to surmount that mountain.\u201d\u201cI am going to fight for myself!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 : In PainRain that had been falling for several days in a row subsided, leaving the public roads utterly muddy.Qudu\u00a0fell into a state of mourning. With the sudden death of the young Emperor Tianchen, rumors that the Marquis of Dingdu, Xiao Chiye, had colluded with the Vice Commander of the Imperial Bodyguard-cum-Northern Judge, Shen Zechuan, to assassinate the emperor with the intent to rebel spread like wildfire as whispers behind closed doors in\u00a0Qudu.As Emperor Tianchen did not have any imperial heir, the ministers presented a memorial to request the Empress Dowager to preside over the overall situation in place of the Emperor. The Empress Dowager repeatedly excused herself on the grounds that the harem must not interfere with state affairs. It was only after the Commander-in-chief of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards, Han Cheng, kowtowed thrice in remonstration that the Empress Dowager was convinced to step in.The Eight Great Training Divisions were back in charge of\u00a0Qudu\u2019s patrols and defenses, and the streets these days were crawling with patrol squads around the clock. Common folks did not dare to venture outdoors, and all the wine taverns and brothels kept their doors shut. It was as if the bustling scene of\u00a0Qudu\u00a0was a thing of the past. Even the color of the vermilion walls and glazed tiles in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0looked washed out by the misty drizzle.Hai Liangyi fainted several times when he wept before the coffin. He was now lying on the bed, unable to drink even a drop of medicine. His hair seemed to have turned entirely white overnight, and those spirited eyes of his that once gleamed with brilliance became dim and gloomy. They even looked particularly turbid and cloudy, after all those tears he had shed.\u201cTeacher.\u201d Kong Qiu sat at the bottom with his head lowered and said, \u201cYou have to eat the medicine. Now that the world is in turmoil, everyone is waiting for you to take the helm and steer the state towards stability once more\u2026 You must take care of your health!\u201dThe tear streaks at the corners of Hai Liangyi\u2019s eyes had not been fully wiped. His gaze drifted, and it was only after a long time that he said, \u201cTake the helm and steer the state towards stability once more? Boran, there is nothing I can do anymore to save the situation.\u201dThe bamboo tube in the courtyard tapped gently against the rock in the stream, exposing the cracked lines. Rain fell soundlessly. Yet there was no way those scars could be covered up. Hai Liangyi was too advanced in age. His vital energy had been worn out by the ups and downs of officialdom, and now, there were signs that he might never recover from his illness.Sorrow overwhelmed Kong Qiu. He sat where he was, weeping with his face covered. \u201cHow\u2026 how did it come to this?!\u201d\u201cHan Cheng is a hypocrite who speaks honeyed words but has the malicious heart of a viper. He is petty and narrow-minded. Now that he has gained power, the entire imperial court of civil and military officials will be on tenterhooks. He forced Xiao Chiye out, and so Libei is now without a shackle. From now on\u2026\u201d Hai Liangyi suddenly started coughing. He propped himself up and vomited out blood. For a moment, he could not hold back his emotions, and he cried in a hoarse voice as he held onto the edge of the bed, \u201cFrom now on, our territory will be torn asunder, and turbulent times will rise once again. The century-old empire of the Li clan will fall into ruins here! I\u2019ve sinned. I\u2019m a sinner! I, Hai Renshi, have spent my entire life shamelessly advancing my own agenda and navigating official circles. Yet it was all to toil in vain for the benefit of these people! I\u2026 Oh, I\u2026\u201dWith a headful of ash white hair, Hai Liangyi hunched over and wailed in a voice so hoarse and so full of despair that it was a tragic sight to behold.\u201cTeacher, Teacher!\u201d Kong Qiu hastily came over to help him up, then looked back and shouted, \u201cMen!\u201dThe door curtain was lifted, but it was Yao Wenyu who entered. On seeing what was happening, he immediately kneeled on the footrest and disregarded the filth as he wiped the tears and blood for Hai Liangyi. At the same time, he directed the attendant to draw water and rinsed the handkerchief. Finally, he helped Hai Liangyi lie down. After soothing him for a moment, he said to Kong Qiu in a soft voice, \u201cYour Excellency, may I ask of you to wait outside, please.\u201dKong Qiu did not dare to disturb them any further and hurriedly retreated to wait outside.After a long time, the sound of Hai Liangyi\u2019s cries receded. Yao Wenyu held the bowl in his hand and personally fed his teacher medicine. It was only after Hai Liangyi fell into a drowsy sleep that he lifted the curtain and stepped out.Kong Qiu wanted to say something, but Yao Wenyu motioned for him to follow the attendant to the main hall first, while he himself made his way through the veranda to the back for a change of clean clothes.\u201cApologies for keeping you waiting, Your Excellency.\u201d Yao Wenyu got the attendant to serve tea and sat down below Kong Qiu.Kong Qiu held the teacup and was silent for a moment before he said, \u201cTeacher has no son. I feel reassured with you here to take care of him. I shouldn\u2019t have brought up these matters earlier\u2026 and ended up making him sad.\u201d\u201cAlthough Teacher has returned home ill, he is still concerned about state affairs. Even if Your Excellency doesn\u2019t bring it up, he would still find it hard to dismiss it from his mind. It\u2019d have been better to cry it out than to bottle it all up in his heart.\u201d Yao Wenyu held up the teacup and stirred it a few times before saying, \u201cThe current situation is unstable and volatile. Teacher won\u2019t be able to rest for long anyway,\u201dKong Qiu knew that Hai Liangyi treated him like his own son. So he did not hold back and said with a sigh, \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s passing is so sudden. We are now already in a disadvantageous position. In addition, the Han clan has control of military power in\u00a0Qudu, and we are presently in an irreversible situation in which Her Majesty is in power and in control of the government. After this incident\u2026 what is to be of Libei in the future?\u201dYao Wenyu was fair by nature, and he looked no different from porcelain as he held that teacup. He said, \u201cThe way things stand now, it\u2019s vital to discuss countermeasures to deal with the situation. Han Cheng\u2019s original position was that of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019 Commander-in-chief. If he wants to overstep his authority and enter the Grand Secretariat to take charge, his only option would be to ask the Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict, so he isn\u2019t exactly without leverage. Wei Huaigu consumed poison and committed suicide because of the military provisions case. The temporary vacancy in the Grand Secretariat will thus have to be filled in by Your Excellency. With this, all the important affairs of the imperial court will still have to be deliberated over and endorsed by the various excellencies under Teacher.\u201dOn hearing this, Kong Qiu set down the teacup and humbly asked, \u201cBut the Empress Dowager is in charge of state affairs, and any changes in the Grand Secretariat is subjected to her whims and fancies. If she issued a change of people using Han Cheng as a pretext, then what should we do?\u201dYao Wenyu smiled and said, \u201cThe Empress Dowager being in charge of state affairs is a desperate measure to begin with. Her surname isn\u2019t Li, so the authority of acting on behalf of the\u00a0Son of Heaven\u00a0can\u2019t convince the public. The others don\u2019t matter; what\u2019s crucial is the Qi clan. Although Qi Zhuyin may be indolent by nature and doesn\u2019t care about government affairs, she has the Qi clan\u2019s reputation for loyalty resting on her shoulder. She will never allow the Empress Dowager and Han Cheng to commit all kinds of outrages in\u00a0Qudu. Since the Empress Dowager wants to win her over to her side, she won\u2019t go too far at this point in time. Rather than worry about the Empress Dowager\u2019s substitution attempt, Your Excellency might as well worry about Han Cheng\u2019s subsequent plans.\u201dKong Qiu said, \u201cHan Cheng went all out to ingratiate himself with the Empress Dowager. He has succeeded.\u201d\u201cIn my humble opinion, it\u2019s just the opposite.\u201d Yao Wenyu lifted his eyes to look at the misty rain at the entrance, \u201cAt this time, it indeed seems like Han Cheng has gained the favor of the Empress Dowager. But looking at the bigger picture in the long run, it\u2019s instead the Empress Dowager who is seeking connection with Han Cheng. The Empress Dowager is able to rise to power because the Emperor had no heir. The imperial court cannot be without a master, and it was out of a lack of options that everyone compromised and made concessions. But Dazhou will definitely have a new\u00a0Son of Heaven. The military power Han Cheng holds in his hands is the real thing. His daringness to lay an encirclement trap for Xiao Chiye to force him out and make his move in Mingli Hall is a clear indicator that he has backing and, therefore, has nothing to fear.\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d Kong Qiu was shocked. \u201cHan Cheng still has the imperial heir in his hands?\u201dYao Wenyu drank the tea and said, \u201cEmperor Guangcheng often ventured out of the palace to stay overnight. It\u2019s hard to say whether there is an imperial heir. It\u2019s just the situation is already now at this stage. Even if Han Cheng doesn\u2019t have the imperial heir in his hands, he will think of every means possible to push someone out.\u201dKong Qiu\u2019s heart went cold. He said, \u201cHan Cheng has soldiers and horses, and the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0to boot. The officials in the capital are all tied down by their own families and might not necessarily be willing to conflict with him should a power struggle really break out. If he forcibly elects someone to sit on the dragon throne and rule the imperial court, we\u2026\u201dYao Wenyu, however, changed the topic and asked, \u201cHas the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0already passed through Dancheng?\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0had already passed through Dancheng, but they had yet to reach the territory of Zhongbo. Xiao Chiye made haste all the way. The soldiers and horses all needed to rest, so they made a stop midway.Shen Zechuan was severely ill, with his old ailment and heartbreak acting up together. He seemed to be conscious, but yet he was not. It was as if he was lying in a puddle of dreams, engulfed once again by the rainwater and filthy blood.Ever since the epidemic the last time, Xiao Chiye suspected that Shen Zechuan had never attempted to recuperate and nurse himself back to health. Instead, the medicines he had consumed in his early years had now turned into a form of latent poison lurking in his body. Xiao Chiye did not dare to be negligent, so he made a stop and immediately went looking for a physician.Shen Zechuan\u2019s head was in a muddle, and the roaring in his ears persisted. He heard Xiao Chiye\u2019s voice, yet he also seemed to hear Teacher\u2019s shouts. He lay on the pillow. The few times he woke up, he thought that he was still in Duanzhou. He smelled the aroma of dishes, as if the one standing outside the door was his\u00a0shiniang, Hua Pingting.But he did not dare to move or look.He seemed to possess it all, but he still had nothing to his name. He thought he had killed off himself, and that this mortal flesh would not shed any more tears. But he had been too young, too full of youthful arrogance and ignorance\u2014that was only because he had yet to experience immeasurable pain. He came this far, feeling as if he was just being executed by dismemberment.Xiao Chiye hugged Shen Zechuan.Shen Zechuan\u2019s nape, which had once radiated seduction, had turned deathly pale. The man himself looked like a cloud lying across the night. Xiao Chiye stayed close to him, hugging him so tightly that he hurt.\u201cCold?\u201d Xiao Chiye asked in a whisper.Shen Zechuan was a little slow to react as he nodded his head. He tilted his head, pressing his cheek against Xiao Chiye\u2019s cheek. That heat warmed him up, making him seem a little more human. He reached out his hand in the darkness to stroke Xiao Chiye\u2019s arm, feebly and slowly.Xiao Chiye turned his hand around to hold Shen Zechuan\u2019s hand, interlocking his fingers tightly with Shen Zechuan\u2019s. He gave all his warmth to Shen Zechuan. His chest, being the most scalding, pressed against Shen Zechuan\u2019s back, as if he could dissolve Shen Zechuan away with the heat. He seemed to be harboring Shen Zechuan in his arms, no longer permitting anyone to get close. He clumsily licked Shen Zechuan\u2019s wound. This was his way of healing. He did not want this person to be in pain ever again.\u201cQiao Tianya has gone to look for\u00a0shifu.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s eyes were dark and gloomy. \u201cWhen will he be back?\u201d\u201cSoon.\u201d Xiao Chiye squeezed Shen Zechuan\u2019s hand and repeated, \u201cSoon.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cI can\u2019t wipe the blood clean.\u201dXiao Chiye said, \u201cWe have both embarked on the way of the asura1\u2014the bloody path of carnage. We have no more need to be clean, as long as we\u2019re together.\u201dShen Zechuan pursed his thin lips slightly and said, \u201cI\u2014\u201dHe paused, dazed, as if he had forgotten what he wanted to say. Listening to the sound of the rain, he closed his mouth again. Xiao Chiye pinched his tightly clenched mouth open and asked, \u201cWhat do you want to say to me?\u201dShen Zechuan turned his head hastily, refusing to let Xiao Chiye look at him squarely in the face. But Xiao Chiye grasped him by his jaws to prevent him from dodging and asked once again in a lowered voice, \u201cWhat do you want to say to me?\u201dShen Zechuan\u2019s face was pale under that gaze. He opened his mouth several times, but could not bring himself to speak. Xiao Chiye gazed at him, until a long time later when he finally heard Shen Zechuan say with a sob, \u201cIt hurts.\u201dXiao Chiye cupped Shen Zechuan\u2019s cheeks and raised his face. Shen Zechuan looked as if he had returned to the time when he was a child. Tears streamed down his cheeks as he repeated \u201cit hurts\u201d over and over again with his lips trembling.Xiao Chiye stroked Shen Zechuan\u2019s hair and wiped his tears with his thumbs. He said, \u201cWhere does it hurt? Tell me all about it.\u201dShen Zechuan broke out into sobs. Even his shoulders were trembling. He was so grief-stricken as he cried, as though he was venting all these years of anguish in this one night. But he was dumb; he did not know where he was hurting. He clearly could no longer endure this kind of pain anymore. He disconsolately let Xiao Chiye wipe his cheeks. Tears brimmed in his eyes. There was nothing left of all those machinations that spoke of a maturity far beyond his age, only naked pain.Xiao Chiye rolled over and embraced Shen Zechuan. He took all of Shen Zechuan into his arms, providing a haven where Shen Zechuan could remove his mask. They hugged each other tightly. Xiao Chiye listened as Shen Zechuan cried himself hoarse, like a small animal that had been abandoned, and at the same time, like a battered child who was broken and bleeding. Gradually, Xiao Chiye\u2019s chest was soaked through. He caressed Shen Zechuan\u2019s hair, answering again and again,\u201cIt won\u2019t hurt anymore. I promise. Lanzhou will never hurt again.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 : On The RunThe rain stopped at the crack of dawn, where heaven and earth appeared like a vast, murky expanse under the intersection of light and darkness. Qi Zhuyin trod on muddy water and withdrew from the military grounds. She secured her arm guards and looked at her own deputy general riding his horse into the camp. Her deputy general\u2019s name was Qi Wei, a strong and sturdy man who was also cautious by nature. He could hoist an ax on the battlefield and hold a needle off the battleground. He was a man of prestigious standing among the troops in the army.Qi Wei dismounted midway and hastily nodded in acknowledgement to the soldiers at the sides of the road who were paying their obeisances to him. He headed straight to Qi Zhuyin\u2019s side and said, \u201cCommander-in-chief, we\u2019ve received news!\u201d\u201cQudu\u00a0or Bianjun?\u201d Qi Zhuyin asked.\u201cBoth.\u201d Qi Wei was not a tall man. He looked around and reported, \u201cQudu\u00a0was caught in a sudden bout of rain and got completely washed out. The Second Young Master of the Xiao clan fled in a hurry with 20,000\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0soldiers and have already arrived at the border of Zhongbo. Looks like he\u2019s going to Cizhou.\u201dQi Zhuyin was not at all alarmed. She tightened her arm guard and let out a vague smile as she bit down on the rope and said, \u201cThat lad sure runs fast.\u201d\u201cFirst there\u2019s the case of the military provisions, and now there\u2019s the encirclement of Xiao Chiye with the intent to kill. The Prince of Libei will no doubt fly into a rage this time.\u201d Following Qi Zhuyin as she walked, Qi Wei said, \u201cIf Libei revolts, we will have to set up additional garrison troops in the Six Prefectures of Zhongbo. The Zhongbo troops will also fall under the Commander-in-chief\u2019s command and governance\u2026.\u201dQi Zhuyin put on her outer garment and said, \u201cZhongbo is such a big place. Even if they transfer them all under my command, I wouldn\u2019t dare to accept.\u00a0Qudu\u2019s matter is of no urgency. Tell me first, what exactly happened to the garrison troops of Bianjun Commandery? Lu Guangbai fought an ambush all the way into the Biansha\u2019s home state?\u201dA hesitant expression materialized on Qi Wei\u2019s rugged face. He said, \u201cCommander-in-chief, General Lu disregarded military orders this time and chased the Biansha Cavalry across the border. I suspect\u2026\u201dHe fell silent and did not voice that word out.Qi Zhuyin said, \u201cThe military provisions this year have been reduced by half. It\u2019ll be tough for Bianjun to hold out based just on that. I signed a memorandum of debt with the Yan clan of Hezhou under Father\u2019s name. The money is meant to be set aside to buy grains for the Bianjun garrison troops. So what\u2019s with this suspicion you\u2019re telling me about? I will not listen to a word without proof.\u201dQi Wei knew that Qi Zhuyin valued her generals and had always been fair in meting out rewards and punishments. She would never trample upon them because of a mere few words. But it was also because he noticed something odd when he went to Bianjun to scout this time that his suspicions were aroused. Not daring to hide it, he truthfully said, \u201cCommander-in-chief, I wouldn\u2019t dare to say a word if I had no proof. The purpose of this trip to Bianjun is to investigate military intelligence from a few days back. But not only did General Lu not return to camp, he even transferred away the garrison troops at the fire beacon towers.\u201dQi Zhuyin stopped in her tracks. She looked at Qi Wei and asked, \u201cHe transferred away the garrison troops at the fire beacon towers?\u201dQi Wei nodded. He was just about to go into details when he heard a commotion at the side. Both of them turned aside and saw a whole new bunch of people clustered around a sedan with embroidered borders pouring into the camp. They were stopped by the guards.On hearing that the guards were adamant about not letting them enter, Yingxi could not help but lift the curtain personally and said in a shrill voice, \u201cDon\u2019t you know who I am? What is there to stop my sedan! I\u2019m the Army-inspecting Censor His Majesty in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0dispatched over! Go announce my arrival, quick. Tell Commander-in-chief Qi that I have something important to tell her!\u201dQi Zhuyin watched from afar and said to Qi Wei, \u201cGo tell him that I\u2019m busy and don\u2019t have the luxury of time to see him. All these eunuchs from\u00a0Qudu\u00a0are the same. Just offer him good food and wine and tell him to keep his mouth shut and not cause trouble. I\u2019m going to the Bianjun Commandery now. Lu Guangbai is not one who will turn deserter. Before I return, tell those from\u00a0Qudu\u00a0that I\u2019m not around. It\u2019s troubled waters over there. Keep a close watch on Father too. If he sends a message to\u00a0Qudu, intercept it and tell him to behave himself.\u201dQi Wei had more to say, but Qi Zhuyin had already flipped atop the horse.Before she left, she looked back and said to Qi Wei, \u201cQudu\u2019s matter needs at least half a month to be settled. No doubt the wedding next month has to be delayed. Remove all those red silks at home first. They all cost money.\u201dWithout further ado after saying her piece, she led the men to skirt around Yingxi\u2019s sedan and headed right for Bianjun Commandery.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Shen Zechuan drank the medicine, and his illness gradually showed signs of improvement along the way. The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0was to continue moving in the northeast direction. They had to think of a way to convince Cizhou\u2019s Prefectural Prefect, Zhou Gui, to let them pass through\u2014but before that, they still had to shake off those pesky and persistent troops pursuing them.\u201cHan Jin is the one in hot pursuit behind us.\u201d Tantai Hu carried his blade and sat all huddled up on the rock. \u201cIf we can\u2019t repel him back before we arrive at Cizhou, then he will use the deployment order to force Zhou Gui to seal off the city and trap us within Zhongbo with our retreat paths all cut off.\u201dXiao Chiye folded his arms and said nothing. There was a rudimentary map before him. Xiao Chiye was not at all afraid of coming to blows with Han Jin, but he had to consider the timing too. The longer this drags on, the less advantageous it would be to the\u00a0Imperial Army. It was only because\u00a0Qudu\u00a0was presently in a state of chaos due to the lack of imperial heir that Qi Zhuyin had not deployed troops to encircle and take him down. By the time things settled down in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0and\u00a0Qudu\u00a0had a hand free to mobilize Qi Zhuyin to pursue and capture them, these 20,000 soldiers of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0would be on a collision course with a wall of metal armors.\u201cThat hard part is not in fighting, but in the speed of battle.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s pale face had yet to recover its rosiness. He picked up a stone and drew a few lines on the ground. \u201cHan Jin dared to chase us this far because there is Dancheng behind him. To the Eight Great Training Divisions in his hands, the granary of Dancheng is just like a wide-opened door; they don\u2019t have to worry about food and clothing. Our 20,000 men ran all the way here in one breath without stopping. We have no army provisions to sustain us. If we want to get to Libei via Cizhou, then we must first resolve this issue.\u201dTantai Hu was still not used to looking at Shen Zechuan face-to-face. He presently fell silent for a moment, then looked at Xiao Chiye.Without looking at him, Xiao Chiye said, \u201cSpit it out if you have something to say.\u201dTantai Hu changed his sitting posture. Pointing at the ground with his finger, he said, \u201cCizhou and us are old acquaintances. Can\u2019t we get Zhou Gui to let us borrow some food for emergency use first with the excuse that there was a delay in them getting the news?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Shen Zechuan let go of the stone. \u201cAt this juncture, all the actions taken implies the taking of sides. Zhou Gui may not have the intent, but as long as he does it, then in\u00a0Qudu\u2019s eyes, he is a traitor who provided aid to the rebel forces. After we pass through Cizhou, he will be taken into custody in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0to be impeached and punished. Zhou Gui has a family. He won\u2019t do this.\u201dDing Tao looked up from his book and said, \u201cChen-ge went to make arrangements for the military provisions, didn\u2019t he? He must be rushing on his way back to us now.\u201d\u201cThe military provisions he prepared have already been dispatched to Libei. It\u2019s Libei Armored Cavalry\u2019s food at the frontline. There isn\u2019t that much surplus left to fill the stomachs of the\u00a0Imperial Army.\u201d Xiao Chiye squatted down and examined the map. \u201cEven if he and Gu Jin come, they won\u2019t be able to bring much food.\u201dAs the saying goes, food and fodder should go before troops and horses.1\u00a0Back then, Libei and Qidong were able to swiftly beat back the Biansha Cavalry because the Biansha Cavalry had no reserve supplies and could not afford to fight a war of attrition. And now, the\u00a0Imperial Army, caught in a dilemma and sandwiched here, similarly could not afford to fight a war of attrition either. Striking Cizhou down might be an option, but it was definitely a bad one. They had successively spent close to 100,000 taels of silver on Cizhou to foster a mutual relationship with Zhou Gui to look out for one another, and that had been done as a safeguard for the future.\u201cTurn back and attack Dancheng.\u201d Tantai Hu pondered it over. \u201cDancheng has a granary. We won\u2019t linger for long in the city. Just take the grains and leave. We can negotiate everything else with Zhou Gui when we arrive at Cizhou.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Shen Zechuan let out a soft sigh. \u201cDancheng has direct military routes to Chuancheng and\u00a0Qudu. Turning back is to give\u00a0Qudu\u00a0time to dispatch the remaining Eight Great Training Divisions. The journey back will take up our time and sap us of energy, and we might not necessarily be able to take down the city swiftly either.\u201dIt was humiliating for Tantai Hu to have both of his proposals vetoed by Shen Zechuan. He rubbed his hands together and said nothing more. His elder brother, Tantai Long, was a brave man who was also a general, but Tantai Hu had no one to teach him. At this moment, he was feeling embarrassed and awkward, but he was pretty much convinced deep down. He was not an unreasonable man. At the very least, he was willing to admit that he was a boor.Xiao Chiye seemed to have an insight into Tantai Hu\u2019s mind. He lifted a hand to pat Tantai Hu on the back and said nonchalantly, \u201cThere may be a time constraint for counterattacking Dancheng, but it\u00a0is\u00a0an idea. You have only fought once in the past with the Eight Great Training Divisions on the streets of\u00a0Qudu. Now that you\u2019ve left\u00a0Qudu, just ask away if there\u2019s something you don\u2019t know. In the future, there will be plenty of moments where you will be needed to lead the troops and make decisions, and you won\u2019t have His Excellency Shen around every time to give you pointers.\u00a0Laohu, the sea of learning knows no bounds. It is with the willingness to take a tumble and have fun in spite of it that you will have a bright future ahead of you.\u201dWith the muddy soil on the ground already drawn into a mess, Shen Zechuan looked up at the sun and said, \u201cHan Jin is a descendent from\u00a0Qudu\u00a0who usually only rides horses on the hunting grounds. So he won\u2019t be able to catch up to us for the time being.\u201d\u201cWe can plunder Han Jin\u2019s food provisions with an ambush here.\u201d Xiao Chiye surveyed the surroundings. \u201cWe won\u2019t even need 20,000 men.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of you.\u201d Shen Zechuan\u2019s fingertips were stained with a bit of mud. He said, \u201cHe has been hesitant and timid in his pursuit of us all this while. To let him fall for the ambush, we will need a bait first.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll lead 500 people to wait here for him. There is a river of silt to the east, backed by mountains on both sides and close to the forest on one side.\u00a0Laohu\u00a0will lead 2,000 people to lay in ambush there.\u201d Xiao Chiye wiped the mud away from Shen Zechuan\u2019s fingertip. \u201cDing Tao will bring some men to the town along the way tonight for food and wine. Say that the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0has fled here, and they are all demoralized because I\u2019m too poor to buy grain and I can\u2019t get out of Zhongbo either, resulting in many of them turning deserters.\u201dHan Jin was young, and he had interactions with Xiao Chiye during the time the public ditches were clogged. Shen Zechuan was right. He was indeed afraid of Xiao Chiye. In fact, there were very few among the noble young masters in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0who were not afraid of Xiao Chiye. Xiao Chiye\u2019s physique and character had already made him a veritable tyrant long before the autumn hunt. The Nanlin Hunting Grounds was a watershed. With their fathers and elder brothers looking out for them, it would be a breeze for direct descendants like Han Jin who were not the eldest sons in their family to enter officialdom. They seemed no different from Xiao Chiye, yet they had never stood out the way Xiao Chiye did. Perhaps he would pursue Xiao Chiye with caution because of his misgivings of the latter, but he would definitely not pass up the chance to defeat him.As long as Xiao Chiye showed him a weakness.\u201cOther than these.\u201d Shen Zechuan considered it for a moment and said to Ding Tao, \u201cYou also have to say that I don\u2019t get along with the marquis and have had so many disputes with him on the way that we are going our separate ways.\u201d\u201cWe are in a difficult position both internally and externally.\u201d Xiao Chiye bared his teeth. \u201cMake it out to be as tragic as you can.\u201dDing Tao swiftly took notes in his book.Not feeling reassured, Tantai Hu asked, \u201cCan Tao-zi act? Say it once for us here first.\u201dDing Tao rubbed his eyes and held up the book with both hands to read, \u201cMy master is in such a miserable state, doomed as he was by those people. The Eight Great Training Divisions keep pursuing us relentlessly like dogs, so much that my master doesn\u2019t even have money for porridge. When we left\u00a0Qudu, we were fleeing for our lives, so we didn\u2019t have time to pack up all those manors and shop, and we didn\u2019t even take the money in the residence. Our pockets are now as empty as sheep poop. Master even owes the ear ornaments shop at Shenwu Street several thousand taels of silver, and there\u2019s no way he can pay it back now. His Excellency Shen fell severely ill after getting caught in the rain, but we have no money to call for a physician. Alas, a poor cou\u2026 uh, His Excellency has forsaken my master too. Our soldiers and horses are now on the run on empty stomachs. I\u2019m too hungry. I\u2019m so hungry that I\u2019m regurgitating bile. I really can\u2019t take it anymore, so I took a few brothers to rob some houses along the way to cobble together some money for ourselves. We were originally all good men from decent families, and it\u2019s all because we followed the wrong person that we were forced into such a corner. Now we are filling up our tummies a little before we continue on our way to seek asylum with Han Jin in Dancheng! Aye, Han Jin is good. He has money and grains. It\u2019s only by throwing in with him that\u00a0we will have a future! The future is\u2026\u201dDing Tao read with great emotion and feeling.\u201cThis master thinks that was pretty well-said.\u201d Xiao Chiye commented. \u201cLaohu, strip off his little robe and smear mud all over his face. Then give him three strings of copper coins and hurry him on his way. There\u2019s no need to eat and drink in a tavern anymore, just beg for alms along the streets in the town\u2014what are you looking pitifully at Lanzhou for?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 : Thank You GiftHan Cheng captured several deserters from the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0one after another. All of them were covered in filth and were so starved that they looked sallow and emaciated. After making several enquiries, he found out about the predicament the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0was in, but still, he did not dare to act rashly and advance his troops without careful consideration. This was because a 20,000-men strong\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0was not a small number. He was continually weighing his chances of winning against Xiao Chiye in a head-on battle.\u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s performance at the Nanlin Hunting Grounds was out of the ordinary. They killed many a number of people when they vied with us for the city gate patrol back then.\u201d Han Jin sat inside the tent and looked at the deserters below. \u201cNow that you people have followed Xiao Chiye into defecting from the capital, how can you simply just break up at the drop of a hat?\u201d\u201cTo reply Your Excellency, we can\u2019t go far.\u201d The army deserter who was kneeling at the foot of Han Ji\u2019s seat said, \u201cWe fled all the way here, far away from civilization with no villages or shops in sight. We have no food nor camping site. Cizhou lies ahead of us, and there\u2019s also the Qidong Garrison Troops if we look south. It\u2019s obvious we are going to be caught in an encirclement like a dumpling being wrapped.\u201dHan Cheng thought it over for a moment carefully and asked, \u201cAre there many deserters?\u201dThe deserter said, \u201cWhen I fled, there were about a few hundred. The\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0is now like duckweeds in a muddy ditch that will scatter at just one strike. It won\u2019t be able to withstand a blow!\u201dHan Jin wondered, \u201cAnd Xiao Chiye didn\u2019t think of a way? I heard that he strictly enforces military law. The soldiers under his command are all very afraid of him.\u201d\u201cYour Excellency doesn\u2019t know this, but\u2026\u201d Having spoken for so long, the deserter swallowed his saliva and said, \u201ccan you give me some rations first? I fucking ran for the entire way, and I\u2019m now so starving I can\u2019t explain it clearly!\u201dHan Jin motioned for the men to give him some rations, and the deserter began to gobble it down on the spot. As he chewed on his food, he said, \u201cThey are afraid of him! In the past, we brothers had nowhere to go in\u00a0Qudu, and so we had no other choice but to follow him, and we ended up offending the various masters of the Eight Great Training Divisions. Now that he even went on to become a traitor, how would we still dare to continue following him?\u201dHan Jin noted that all these deserters did indeed seem to be down and out. What\u2019s more, they were captured back. It did not look like they were faking. He could not help but make some mental calculations carefully in his mind. First, he got the men to take the deserters out. Then he began to deliberate over the battle strategy in his tent with his advisors.Among the advisors was a man called Gao Zhongxiong, who had been the person taking the lead back then when the Imperial College had stirred up a disturbance. As he had offended Pan Rugui and was thrown into prison with no one to vouch for him, he gave up the idea of an official career and threw in his lot with Han Jin. He was a high-spirited scholar full of patriotic fervor who abhorred traitors to the state all his life. Shen Wei, Pan Rugui, and the likes were all men he held in contempt. And now, hearing that Xiao Chiye had fled the state after carrying out an assassination, he was even more worked up, unable to condone it.Gao Zhongxiong pointed at the map and said, \u201cSince Xiao Chiye is already at the end of his rope, we cannot tolerate him being on the run within Zhongbo\u2019s territory. The Viceroy has a strong army with sturdy horses and Dancheng to fall back upon. In my view, there\u2019s no time to lose. We will be able to deploy troops to pursue and attack him shortly. As long as he is captured before he enters Cizhou, it\u2019d be a meritorious service rendered.\u201dHan Jin was still hesitating. He said, \u201cBut Xiao Chiye still had more than 10,000 men, and they are all real men who have been through the Nanlin Hunting Grounds incident. If there\u2019s a trap\u2026\u201dGao Zhongxiong did not think the same. He said, \u201cThe soldiers of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0are demoralized, and they are all not of one mind. There\u2019s no difference between 10,000 men and one man. They are now just a motley crew of disorganized men; they are nothing to worry about. The Viceroy had already pursued him all the way here. If we can\u2019t capture him as soon as possible and bring him to justice, we won\u2019t be able to account for it to\u00a0Qudu\u00a0either. \u201dPretty much stirred, Han Jin asked, \u201cWhat should I do if he\u2019s in cahoots with the Prefectural Prefect, Zhou Gui, to hatch a plot to do me harm?\u201dGao Zhongxiong said with slight urgency, \u201cViceroy, that Zhou Gui is a man with a family. Would he cast aside a decent official position to plot a revolt with the traitor Xiao Chiye? He won\u2019t dare to. If we dispatch troops now, we will definitely catch Xiao Chiye by surprise. Then we can follow up the victory and press home the attack, and we will be able to return in triumph.\u201dHan Jin had been sleeping in the tent for days in a row and was already displeased from all the mosquitoes and bugs bites over his body. He was still thinking of\u00a0Qudu, where his eldest brother, Han Cheng, had aided the Empress Dowager in gaining charge of the government. The glorious rise of the Han clan was right before him. It was just the perfect time for him to return and call up his friends and associates for a lavish celebration. The longer he stayed here, the more irritable he became. So right after hearing Gao Zhongxiong\u2019s words, he weighed over the pros and cons and promptly agreed.The next day, Han Jin woke up early and led the troops onwards while there was still dew outside. Using the information provided by the deserters, he followed the trail to the forested area outside the river of silt. There were earthen stoves dug all over the forest, but not in a way that could provide food for 20,000 people.Han Jin thoroughly believed the deserters\u2019 words now. With his spirits soaring, he drew his blade from where he was on his horse and brandished it forward, saying, \u201cThe traitors have no way out now. Search the forest all over. We will surely find their traces!\u201dThe soldiers of the Eight Great Training Divisions surged forth.Xiao Chiye was squatting by the stream, washing his face. On hearing sounds, he looked back just in time to see Han Jin spurring his horse over.The moment Han Jin saw Xiao Chiye, he hurriedly bellowed, \u201cThe traitor is here. Catch him quick!\u201dXiao Chiye whistled to summon\u00a0Lang Tao Xue Jin. The smattering of five hundred men all seemed to be in a panicked fluster, shouting and yelling as they were chased through the forest. On seeing the situation, Han Jin could not help but get all fired up. He laughed out loud a few times, then shouted from afar, \u201cYour Lordship, to think you\u2019d fall into such a state today!\u201dXiao Chiye ignored the soldiers and fled away alone on his horse. Han Jin was afraid he would make his escape and hurriedly led his men in hot pursuit. The Eight Great Training Divisions charged through the forest, following Han Jin towards the northeast at full throttle. The more Han Jin ran, the more anxious he became. He shouted after him from behind, \u201cXiao Chiye! You\u2019re already at a dead end. Surrender yourself quickly!\u201dXiao Chiye looked back on horseback and led his men in an attempt to resist, but they were no match for the Eight Great Training Divisions\u2019 ferociousness. The sight of the five hundred men being chased was a sorry sight to behold. In the blink of an eye, they had already fled out of the forest. They made a beeline towards the river of silt, where they were finally boxed in at the side of the river.\u201cXiao Chiye!\u201d Han Jin reined in the horse and waved his sleeve. \u201cLook around you. It\u2019s all soldiers from my Eight Great Training Divisions! You\u2019re currently besieged and under attacked on all sides. So what are you still struggling for? Beg for mercy now, and I\u2019ll spare your life!\u201dLang Tao Xue Jin\u00a0dug its hooves where it stood. Xiao Chiye said frostily, \u201cYou want me to die, sure. I\u2019ll just ask you one question. Why didn\u2019t Han Cheng come himself today?\u201d\u201cMy eldest brother is currently the noble regent, with weighty and taxing official duties to attend to. How would he come here to deal with you?\u201d Han Jin pointed at Xiao Chiye with his sword. \u201cIf you get off your horse to await capture, your Xiao clan will still have a slim chance of survival. You alone committed such a heinous and grave mistake, yet you are willing to let your entire family pay for it with their lives now?\u201cI\u2019ve indeed made many mistakes.\u201d Xiao Chiye nodded slightly and looked askance at Han Jin, \u201cBut it\u2019s not your Han clan\u2019s place to talk about it with me.\u201dThe moment the words left his mouth, several hundreds of people suddenly climbed to their feet from both sides. Tantai Hu took the lead and completely surrounded Han Jin from behind. Leading the soldiers from the back, he slashed away at everyone he saw, throwing both men and horses off their feet into utter confusion and a crushing defeat. Han Jin\u2019s guards on his left and right were all\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0whom Han Cheng had assigned over to protect Han Jin. On seeing this, they realized that they had fallen for the trap and immediately raised their whips to whip Han Jin\u2019s horse in an attempt to lead him to break out of the encirclement from the side of the forest.Where had Han Jin ever seen such a battle array before? He was pretty much an expert when it came to past military exercises held at the\u00a0Qudu\u00a0military grounds. But he had never truly fought a war before. He was already totally frightened out of his wits. The pain jerked the horse into action, and it broke into a mad dash towards the periphery of the encirclement in the forest, with the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0forming a protective circle around it.With his blade in hand, Shen Zechuan stood in the shadows of the tree and looked at Han Jin.Han Jin still wanted to charge on ahead, but a sharp-eyed Imperial Bodyguard deftly reined in the horse. Under cold sweat and fresh blood, the group of people exchanged eye signals with each other. Eventually, the man at the head spoke, \u201cVice Commander! It\u2019s affinity that leads us to encounter each other today. How about letting us go on account of our past comradeship?\u201dShen Zechuan had lost a lot of weight in the past few days. The wrist bones on the hand he was grasping the blade with looked just like a crescent moon peeking out in an icy-colored arc from that plain white sleeve opening of his. His eyes seemed to harbor solid ice that never melted throughout the seasons, yet a smile infused with the warmth of spring gradually materialized on his face. He said, \u201cI do understand that the various brothers have been entrusted by another with this mission and, therefore, had no choice but to do it.\u201dThat man knew Shen Zechuan was malicious and ruthless by nature. So when he saw him reveal a smile, he shielded Han Jin and took a few steps back instead. The thunderous sound of fighting and killing filled the air behind him. Xiao Chiye was also closing in on them, one step at a time. Sweat trickled down the man\u2019s temples. He said, \u201cYour Excellency has a bright future ahead of you, so why follow a traitor and suffer untold hardships here? If you are willing to release Viceroy Han back to the capital, the Commander-in-chief will definitely forgive and forget past grudges and welcome you back to the capital!\u201dUnexpectedly enough, Shen Zechuan chuckled. His voice was clear and unhurried, and he was a pretty sight to behold when he smiled. That pale skin of his looked extraordinarily delicate under the speckles of sunlight. Very slowly, he drew out his blade, scraping\u00a0Yang Shan Xue\u2019s slender and long blade against its sheath.\u201cI\u2019m very grateful to Han Cheng.\u201d Shen Zechuan backhandedly grasped hold of the hilt and paused. \u201cWords cannot express the extent of my gratitude towards him. When you return this time, please bring him a thank you gift on my behalf.\u201dHan Jin felt a chill on his back and nearly tumbled off his horse.\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Xiao Chiye rinsed away the blood on the blade at the edge of the water. Shen Zechuan squatted at the back to clean his hands. He buried his entire palms into the stream. Even when Xiao Chiye was done washing his blade, Shen Zechuan did not remove them. Xiao Chiye squatted opposite Shen Zechuan. He was much taller than him, but he could still put his head against Shen Zechuan\u2019s. Both men\u2019s palms met in the water, and Xiao Chiye grasped hold of his fingertips.Shen Zechuan\u2019s sobs seemed to be a dream of the night, seeing as how he was clean and composed under the sunlight. Very slowly, his index finger stroked along Xiao Chiye\u2019s hand and made its way through the gap between Xiao Chiye\u2019s fingers. His palm fitted into Xiao Chiye\u2019s palm, bringing along with it the icy-cold softness of the water current.Tantai Hu was presently leading the men to clean up the battlefield. They still had to stay over for a night in this forest. There were soldiers not far away all around them, but Shen Zechuan\u2019s hand clung to his, as if he was nonchalantly playing with it. At the same time, it also seemed like a seduction long premeditated.He still had the stench of blood on him.Xiao Chiye let him do as he wished and said, \u201cYou left only one soldier alive and sent him back. He might not necessarily be willing to bring the message back to them.\u201dShen Zechuan looked at the shimmering surface of the stream and said, \u201cHe\u2019s an Imperial Bodyguard. As long as he is still alive, he has to complete the mission. Han Jin has fallen into our hands. If he doesn\u2019t bring news of it back, then he has failed in his mission. He\u2019s going to die anyway, might as well die with a little more dignity. Furthermore, the heads in that burlap sack are all those of\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0on the job with a waist token. He has to bring his brothers home.\u201dXiao Chiye wanted to wipe away the droplets of blood on Shen Zechuan\u2019s wrists. But there were people all around. Both of them gazed at each other for a moment. He suddenly grasped Shen Zechuan back, then slowly leaned forward and said, \u201cThe earring dropped in\u00a0Qudu. I\u2019ll make a new one for you once we arrived in Libei.\u201d\u201cYou still have an outstanding bill of several thousand taels of silvers.\u201d Shen Zechuan looked at him. \u201cTighten your belt and make some money first,\u00a0er-gongzi.\u201d\u201cI can marry into a rich family. Pledge myself in marriage in exchange for money.\u201d Xiao Chiye lowered his voice.Propping himself up against the soft sediment at the bottom of the stream, Shen Zechuan whispered into Xiao Chiye\u2019s ear, \u201cFive hundred taels for one night\u2026\u201dThat bit of enchanting sensuality had yet to pervade the atmosphere between them when Shen Zechuan suddenly looked back with a stern countenance and said to Tantai Hu, who had wanted to go over but did not know what posture he should adopt to walk over, \u201cHan Jin must not have brought plenty of provisions along this time considering that he had been thinking of going back to\u00a0Qudu\u00a0soonest possible and that he had Dancheng to fill in whatever he was lacking. Have everyone cook all those provisions tonight. Tomorrow morning, we\u2014\u201dShen Zechuan stopped abruptly for a moment. He swiftly cast a sidelong glance at Xiao Chiye before he continued, \u201c\u2026 will continue on our way to the northeast.\u201dXiao Chiye said nothing and washed the handkerchief in all seriousness, all the while conveniently caressing Shen Zechuan\u2019s hand that had been covered under the handkerchief until it turned a shade of light red.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 : Hidden DangerNews of Han Jin\u2019s rash advance made its way back to\u00a0Qudu, causing quite the stir. Because the only surviving Imperial Bodyguard brought back a sack of human heads, making it clear to all that Shen Zechuan and Xiao Chiye had completely split from\u00a0Qudu. There was no longer a glimmer of possibility that both sides could sit down for negotiation. Han Jin\u2019s capture threw Han Cheng into a rage. When Shen Zechuan left\u00a0Qudu, the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0were already falling apart. The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0led by Ge Qingqing were still in Juexi looking after the Xi clan, and Fei Sheng had gone into hiding with his own trusted men. Han Cheng did not have much manpower left on hand.The\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0were at the height of power and the peak of glory under Ji Wufan\u2019s command. By the time the command fell to Ji Lei, it was already on the decline. And now, in Han Cheng\u2019s hands, it had thoroughly turned into an utterly fractured squad of ceremonial guards. The batch of men under Fei Sheng\u2019s command were all capable men, but Han Cheng\u2019s premature exposure of his intent to kill Fei Sheng had consequently caused him to miss the chance to win Fei Sheng over to his side.\u201cOnce the overall situation has stabilized, the Twelve Offices of the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0will have to be reorganized. Our lack of current manpower is really a disgrace, and we can\u2019t get anything done with this few people.\u201d Han Cheng sat at the right-handed seat below the Empress Dowager and said in a steady voice, \u201cI noticed that the noble clans\u2019 descendants are mostly in positions with practically no obligations lately. Giving them a place to go would also prevent them from recklessly stirring up trouble at this crucial juncture.\u201dThe Empress Dowager wore a crown of jade, with her hair tidily worn in a bun and her sideburns, trimmed. Pendant earrings inlaid with gold and gems dangled at the sides of her ears. She was really suited to dressing in such an elegant and poised manner, just like how a peony ought to be grown in the main halls of the nobles. Only gold and jade in its glorious splendor was worthy enough for a divine beauty of this caliber. She was already beyond her prime, yet her graceful demeanor was far from diminished. At present, she was holding a wooden spoon, teasing the parrot. Without even looking at Han Cheng, she said, \u201cThe\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0is a place where serious work is done. It\u2019s already providing for many hereditary descendants of the noble clans. Keep stuffing more people inside, and it will be rendered useless sooner or later. The Eight Great Training Divisions suffered a defeat in the battle outside Dancheng. If you ask me, it not only needs an infusion of new blood, but also a dismissal of some old-timers.\u201dIt was precisely at the behest of someone else that Han Cheng was thinking of finding decent posts for the young masters of the noble clans. On hearing this, he said, \u201cI have the same intent. I\u2019ll discuss it over with the Ministry of War tomorrow and write a memorial to submit to the Grand Secretariat. Your Majesty, that Hai Liangyi is so sick that he can\u2019t even straighten his back. He has been toiling hard his entire lifetime for state affairs. At the very least, we mustn\u2019t let him exhaust himself to death while on the job. We need to come up with an arrangement for him.\u201dBy this, he meant for Hai Liangyi to be relieved of his post and sent back to his hometown. With a smile on her face, the Empress Dowager tapped the wooden spoon and handed it over to Matron Liuxiang, who was serving at the side. She said to Han Cheng with an amicable countenance, \u201cWhat he has is an affliction of the heart for which he has yet to regain his footing. He\u2019s still the one who understands many of the Six Ministries\u2019 affairs best. How can we rashly dismiss him back to his hometown at such a crucial time? Let\u2019s wait for a few more days.\u201dHan Cheng, having been tactfully rebuffed, gnashed his teeth inwardly, although he kept his expression unchanged on his face and said, \u201cYour Majesty is the one leading the administration now, so naturally, Your Majesty is the one who decides. Since the Eight Great Training Divisions have been defeated before the City of Dancheng, and Xiao Chiye has already fled to Zhongbo, then it\u2019d be better for the Ministry of War to mobilize the Qidong Garrison Troops to stop them as soon as possible. Otherwise, the Libei Armored Cavalry would have a 20,000-men strong reinforcement by the time he returns to Libei!\u201dThe Empress Dowager cleaned her hands and said, \u201cIf you had been able to stop him in\u00a0Qudu, we would not have all these subsequent worries now. That Prefectural Prefect, Zhou Gui, knows how to do his job, and he is also caught in a tight spot. He still has to come into contact with Libei in the future, so he will definitely not offend Libei. Xiao Chiye\u2019s return to Libei is already a foregone conclusion. Even if we get Qi Zhuyin to go, she\u2019ll be just fighting the Libei Armored Cavalry in a head-on attack. It\u2019s easy for us to talk about deploying troops here. But where are the military provisions to sustain the army as they head north? Hezhou can\u2019t bear this extra burden.\u201d\u201cThen are we just going to let Xiao Chiye return to Libei just like this?\u201d Han Cheng stood up in astonishment. \u201cThis will make Libei even more powerful, like a tiger that has been given wings!\u201dThe Empress Dowager let Matron Liuxiang hold her for support as she stood at the entrance of the front yard to look at the beautiful flowers in a multitude of vivid colors. She asked, \u201cHan Cheng, do you think that Xiao Chiye will definitely be of assistance when he returns to Libei?\u201dHan Cheng put on a look as if he was listening attentively and said deferentially, \u201cI do not understand. Please enlighten me.\u201d\u201cFrom the time Xiao Jiming took over military power of the Libei Armored Cavalry from Xiao Fangxu, he used ten years to get to where he is today. He is the heart of the Libei\u2019s military forces, one the soldiers look up to.\u201d The Empress Dowager watched as Hua Xiangyi pounced on butterflies in the garden with the maidservants and could not help but reveal a smile. She watched for a while longer before she continued, \u201cXiao Chiye has left Libei for six years. His return now makes him look like a wolf pup intruding into someone else\u2019s territory. He said\u00a0Qudu\u00a0is not the hometown in his dreams, but he is too young to understand the implied meaning of the phrase \u2018circumstances change with the passage of time\u2019. Leading that 20,000-strong\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0of his, he will gradually come to realize how out of element he is in Libei. Xiao Fangxu has always taken the hard line in setting up the Libei Armored Cavalry under one command. This is the reason why he is still standing, but it\u2019s also going to be the reason why it will be hard for Xiao Chiye to fit in. In a pack of wolves feeding on meat, Xiao Chiye, in order to kill his way out of the encirclement to become the alpha wolf, must first have the determination to bite the former king of wolf to death.\u201dThe Empress Dowager looked back and smiled at Han Cheng.\u201cThe Xiao clan can\u2019t bear the sight of internal strife among the other clans. But sometimes, there is no other choice. The Xiao clan has always been a paragon of brotherly love and respect, but how long can this brotherhood last in the face of military power? The battlefield is a cruel place. It is where the blood of millions of battered soldiers is shed. But the combat zone for power is even more brutal. A change of hands often means infighting and fratricide.\u201dHan Cheng indistinctly shrank under the Empress Dowager\u2019s gaze. He hurriedly lowered his head in agreement and said, \u201cYour Majesty is wise. But Xiao Jiming is already seriously injured. It\u2019s entirely justifiable for Xiao Chiye to stand in for him.\u201dThe Empress Dowager asked, \u201cDid Xiao Jiming die?\u201dHan Cheng shook his head.The Empress Dowager said, \u201cXiao Jiming didn\u2019t die. He can still assist and coordinate military affairs from the back, while Xiao Fangxu, with his re-emergence, can command the soldiers from the front. This pair of father and son controls the Libei Armored Cavalry. There are many matters in which they have to show mutual understanding in order to keep it up. But Xiao Chiye has both the ability to unify and coordinate military affairs and the ability to charge into battle and kill the enemies. If he barges into this equilibrium \u2013 among that extremely unified military leadership \u2013 then he will be the unforeseen event that hinders the Libei Armored Cavalry from having only one commander-in-chief. Maybe he doesn\u2019t have the intent to take his father and elder brother\u2019s place. But very soon, he will understand that Libei isn\u2019t as indivisible as we see it. His return is the hidden danger that will bring about Libei\u2019s split.\u201dThe trajectory of such a situation was not something anyone can deliberately direct. It was something that took shape in passing based on the opportunities present. The seed had been sown the day Xiao Fangxu led the Libei Armored Cavalry in an attempt to take a stand against\u00a0Qudu. But as for what fruit it would reap, no one knew.1\u201cIn this world, the common man has the worries of the common men to bear, while a talented one has the agony of the talented to endure.\u201d The Empress Dowager said calmly. \u201cSince there is already a Xiao Jiming, then why beget another Xiao Chiye? Six years is not a long time, nor is it a short time, yet it\u2019s enough to change many things. The source of Xiao Chiye\u2019s agony in\u00a0Qudu\u00a0comes from the fact that he is not a man of mediocre ability. But after he returns to Libei, he will still continue to be tormented by this kind of suffering. Once this pair of role models for brotherhood realizes that killing each other is the only way out, the anguish will intensify. Whether it is Xiao Jiming who gives up his position to Xiao Chiye, or if it is Xiao Chiye who excuses himself to avoid suspicion, even brothers who were once loyal and devoted to each other will grow estranged.\u201dUnder the warmth of this fifth month, Han Cheng felt a chill, followed by a tingle of thrill.\u201cThe former emperor has already been buried. There ought to be some signs of progress for the preparation of the new ruler.\u201d The Empress Dowager said, \u201cYou said you\u2019ve found the imperial heir. When are you going to bring the imperial heir out for me to have a look?\u201dHan Cheng said with a slight bow, \u201cI\u2019ve already sent men to bring the imperial heir to\u00a0Qudu\u00a0at top speed. Your Majesty will be able to see the imperial heir in five days at the latest.\u201dThe Empress Dowager looked at him and said, \u201cSince you\u2019re so sure he is the imperial heir, you must have credible proof that will convince the others. The civil officials led by Hai Liangyi aren\u2019t that easy to dismiss. Han Cheng, you should go and make preparations.\u201dHan Cheng kept her company for a while longer, then said his farewell and left. The moment he left, Hua Xiangyi approached the Empress Dowager with a flower branch in her arms.\u201cHan Cheng has never climbed this high before. Just let him in on it a little, and he lost all sense of propriety.\u201d The Empress Dowager looked in the direction in which Han Cheng had left and pulled Hua Xiangyi along to stroll a few steps. \u201cWhat a fool that Han Jin is to be defeated in Dancheng. He has the timing, location, and manpower all in his favor, and he still ended up being taken captive. How can such a person take on heavy responsibilities? Han Cheng\u2019s words in the palace today are all hints for me to dispatch men to save him. Little would he imagine that they only kept Han Jin alive to threaten him with.\u201d\u201cI noticed that the commander-in-chief has been looking good lately. He doesn\u2019t even address himself as \u2018this subject\u2019 when he enters the palace to pay his respects.\u201d Hua Xiangyi leaned on the Empress Dowager. \u201cAuntie, he\u2019s up to no good. Going by how early his preparation of the so-called imperial heir is, I fear he\u2019s already no longer satisfied with being the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u2019 Commander-in-chief.\u201d\u201cHe wants to be the prince regent.\u201d The Empress Dowager took away the flowers in Hua Xiangyi\u2019s arms. \u201cI\u2019ve already made inquiries into the child he has chosen. How is that an orphan of the late emperor? It\u2019s merely a child he found from a distant relative in his native hometown. It\u2019s a tad delusional for such a lowly thing to dream of occupying the Li clan\u2019s empire, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThe Empress Dowager thought for a moment.\u201cBut there\u2019s really no one else at present.\u201dWhile both of them were conversing, they suddenly saw Fuman hurrying over. He paid his obeisance and said in an obsequious manner, \u201cHis Excellency the Assistant Minister Xue requests an audience.\u201d\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u25c8Tantai Hu distributed the food that night. Just as Shen Zechuan expected, Han Jin had traveled light when he led the troops in pursuit of them and did not bring that much food. The\u00a0Imperial Army, however, had gone hungry for several days. At least they could eat their fill tonight.Shen Zechuan had grown terribly thin after his teacher\u2019s passing, but this forest had been long cleared out, and there was not even a rabbit around. Xiao Chiye took out the steamed bun and meat jerky he had hoarded and gave it all to Shen Zechuan, while he himself ate dry biscuits and rice water just like everyone else.\u201cI\u2019ve done as per Master\u2019s arrangement and sent someone to notify Zhou Gui so that he can get prepared.\u201d Tantai Hu crouched down next to the fire and said, \u201cMaster will be able to go home once we make our way past Cizhou the day after tomorrow!\u201dXiao Chiye threw firewood into the bonfire and said, \u201cInforming Zhou Gui is just to get him to play along with us. With Han Jin in our hands, he will have no other choice but to give way.\u201d\u201cThis Han Jin really came at the most opportune time.\u201d Tantai Hu grinned. \u201c Just the day before, we were still thinking about how to get past Cizhou, and he delivered himself right to our doorstep!\u201dShen Zechuan warmed his hands by the fire and said nothing as he looked at the fire.Tantai Hu soaked the biscuit and said, \u201cI\u2019ve eaten this kind of provision when I was a part of Dengzhou\u2019s garrison troop a few years back. Zhongbo, looking at it again now, is different from the Zhongbo of the past\u2026 I almost can\u2019t recognize it.\u201dDing Tao poured out a bit of rice in his bowl to feed to the sparrow in his sleeve. When he heard this, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s still not too bad here. Go further east, and that\u2019s what it truly means to be totally a different sight.\u201dDing Tao had a photographic memory. He still remembered the tragic scenes he had seen in Duanzhou and Dunzhou six years ago when he followed Xiao Chiye and the army to clean up the mess. That year, he was only ten years old. He had just gotten a little notebook and was just starting to take notes just like his father did. And consequently, he had nightmares the entire journey.\u201cYou were merely passing by after the battle. You\u2019ve never seen how Zhongbo used to look like.\u201d Tantai Hu lowered his eyes to look at the soup in the bowl. \u201cI followed my parents to Dunzhou when I was a child. It was really big, and almost as bustling as\u00a0Qudu. The display of fireworks and lanterns during the new year2\u00a0was very beautiful, as was the turtle mountain lantern display.3\u00a0People crowding and jostling with one another\u2026 so many people.\u201dShen Wei was the Prince of Jianxing, and the Prince of Jianxing\u2019s Manor was in\u00a0 Dunzhou. For a moment, all of them lowered their heads. No one dared to glance at Shen Zechuan, not to mention that they were also afraid of offending Xiao Chiye too. These few days on the road, the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0had gradually come to discover the subtle and delicate relationship between Shen Zechuan and Xiao Chiye. It was a completely different feeling to come face-to-face with it compared to when it had been merely rumors to them before.How should they see Shen Zechuan? Do they regard him as their madam\u2014the wife of their commander-in-chief? But which household\u2019s lady could command the\u00a0Imperial Bodyguards\u00a0to raid others thrice? When he hacked off the heads of all those old subordinates who were protecting Han Jin, not one of the\u00a0Imperial Army\u2019s military officials could bring themselves to watch.Shen Zechuan was too different from Xiao Chiye. He did not look and behave like the Commander-in-chief the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0was familiar with. He seemed to be gentle and modest, yet he rarely changed his mind during official discussions. He would even overrule Tantai Hu outright. Compared to Xiao Chiye, he was a lot more cold-blooded. In the past, they all privately saw Shen Zechuan as a mere beauty\u2014a delicate fragility that clung on to the stronghold of power. But after Shen Zechuan put on the scarlet python robe,4\u00a0everything that he had once concealed was exposed to the public. He became someone different from that last remnant of the Shen clan they knew of in the past. His beauty was no longer a vision anyone could wantonly admire at will\u2014that was an unrivaled allure that bespoke a ruthless strength.There were very few people in the\u00a0Imperial Army\u00a0who were willing to look at Shen Zechuan in the eye, other than the totally clueless Ding Tao. Even Tantai Hu could sense a certain kind of pressure. They took their orders from Xiao Chiye, and they did not mind if Xiao Chiye liked men, but they had to figure out what Shen Zechuan\u2019s position was soonest possible\u2014Shen Zechuan had the might that put him on par to vie with Xiao Chiye for power and authority. This was what they were most unaccustomed to these few days: the subtle fear.Xiao Chiye rubbed his thumb ring gently. He was just about to speak when Shen Zechuan turned his palms over and said, \u201cThe wild herbs and vegetables in Duanzhou are delicious.\u201dThe tension in the atmosphere eased a little. Sure enough, Ding Tao raised his head and said, \u201cI heard from others back in Libei that a handful of wild vegetables in Duanzhou during the winter are as expensive as gold. I want to try them! Young master, do you eat them often?\u201d\u201cWhen the ice and snow melt in spring, my\u00a0shiniang\u00a0would choose the most tender wild vegetables to make dumplings.\u201d Shen Zechuan replied in his usual tone. His fingertips were clean and free of dust, as if they had never been tainted with those blood stains before. He said with a smile, \u201cI rarely eat them. That\u2019s why I remember it so clearly.\u201dDing Tao gulped down his saliva and wrote carefully in his notebook with that bit of ink he had. \u201cI want to eat it. We will definitely get the chance to in the future. If I note it down, I won\u2019t forget it.\u201dTantai Hu rubbed the back of Ding Tao\u2019s head and chided him with a smile, \u201cGrow up! What delicacy is there that you have never tasted before? To think you are still thinking about wild vegetables!\u201dEveryone laughed, and the topic of Zhongbo was thus diverted. Shen Zechuan warmed up his hands and said nothing more.At night, Xiao Chiye rested his head on a stone. He had yet to fall asleep when a slightly hot oil paper stuck to his cheek. He sat up and took a sniff at it from Shen Zechuan\u2019s hands. He smiled and said, \u201cWhere did you get this bun from?\u201d\u201cDing Tao brought it back from the town. He said to keep it for eating.\u201d Shen Zechuan sat beside Xiao Chiye.Both men sat side to side, with the already asleep forest belt at their backs, and the boundless starry sky before them. Xiao Chiye opened the oil paper and pushed it towards Shen Zechuan. He said, \u201cThen eat it. It\u2019s going to get cold if you keep it any longer.\u201dShen Zechuan said, \u201cI\u2019m full. You can have it.\u201dKnowing that Shen Zechuan was keeping it specially for him, Xiao Chiye took it and broke it into two, with one half in one hand for himself, and the other half in the other hand for Shen Zechuan. Shen Zechuan took a few symbolic bites and let Xiao Chiye finish the rest of it.\u201cYou also have to decide whether the betrothal gift of two million should be taken to Libei or left in Cizhou.\u201d Xiao Chiye drank the water from the water bag. \u201c Ge Qingqing will surely keep an eye on the Xi clan\u2019s business for you when he receives the message. Once we reach Libei, Qiao Tianya and Chen Yang should have also hurried back too. When the time comes, we\u2019ll set up a new compound\u2026\u201dXiao Chiye stopped, acutely sensing something off in this unusual silence. He fell silent for a moment.\u201cIs there something you want to tell me?\u201dGrasping the little bamboo fan that never left his side in his hands, Shen Zechuan looked at Xiao Chiye out of the corners of his eyes and said, \u201cCe\u2019an, I can\u2019t go with you to Libei.\u201dThe way he spoke was so gentle. Just like that time at the top of the city gate when he had said to Xiao Chiye with the same tenderness,\u00a0\u201cCe\u2019an, go home.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
