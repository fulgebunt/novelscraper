There were dozens of cars around the crowd. Most of them were super sports cars.The most eye-catching spot was the two cars that were about to leave.One was the most expensive bright red Ferrari 488, which cost more than four million, while the other was the cheapest Ford Mustang, which cost five hundred thousand. The two cars standing next to each other formed a stark contrast.This was a showdown between the new young master of the Shang Jing, Liu Feng, and one of the first four young masters, Zhang Han.Zhang Han leaned on his car. His clothes were slovenly, and his hair was long. When he lowered his head, his eyes were covered with his bangs. No one could see his closed eyes, and from the cut on the lower half of his face, they could still see the unique handsome appearance that Young Master Zhang had, but his temperament now had become depressed.As for Liu Feng, he was surrounded by the people on the right side as if he was surrounded by stars. His expression made it seem as if he was saying that the entire world was under his feet.\u201cLet\u2019s go to see the ever-superior Young Master Zhang.\u201dLiu Feng waved his hand, and led the way with a cold smile.\u201cYoung Master Zhang?\u201dWalking up to it, Liu Feng saw that Zhang Han did not react, so he asked in a weird tone: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you asleep? The previously insufferably arrogant Young Master Zhang is now in such dire straits. Tsk tsk, the competition is about to begin, why are you still pretending to be cold, my Young Master Zhang! \u201dThe moment he opened his mouth, the lackeys beside him who wanted to show off all chimed in:\u201cWith his current appearance, I think he\u2019s just a poor beggar!\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s even as good as someone who asks for food. He might be living off pig food.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAt the side of the Mustang stood a fat, bespectacled man with a little girl of three or four years old on his lap.Other than her messy hair, everything else was perfect. It was just that at this time, the little girl\u2019s clear and large eyes were filled with tears. Listening to the crowd berating Zhang Han, she almost cried tears of grievance.If it was in normal times, the little girl\u2019s cute look would have attracted many gazes. But now, it was time for Liu Feng to perform alone.A burst of ridiculing and cursing finally got a reaction from Zhang Han.The moment Zhang Han opened his eyes, there was a blank look on his face. Seeing the actions of the people in front of him, his eyes focused, which were filled with a look of contempt for the world.\u201cYou ants dare to bark in front of me?\u201dZhang Han suddenly burst out with such strange words.The entire audience went silent for a moment, but the next moment, the mocking laughter filled the air.\u201cZhang Han, I think you are f * cking crazy!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid he didn\u2019t turn into a fool.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone started to mock him again, but when Zhang Han saw the scene in front of him clearly, he was stunned.\u201cIsn\u2019t this when I was racing against Liu Feng in the Mount Lang Xing in 2009?\u201d\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t I undergoing the heavenly tribulation?\u201d\u201cCould it be\u2026 I\u2019m back? \u201d\u201cI was reborn by the divine thunder over the sky of the heavenly tribulation?\u201dZhang Han\u2019s eyes flashed with a trace of shock.In Zhang Han\u2019s memories, five years ago, the Zhang Family was one of the eight great families of the Shang Jing. Zhang Han\u2019s father was the patriarch at the time, so Zhang Han was not afraid of the heavens or the earth. However, when his family traveled by plane, they suffered an air crash halfway. His parents and sister were died. The second uncle Zhang Ming was appointed as the owner, but he did not stop Zhang family from falling.Zhang Han had received a huge blow and thought that his family was being murdered, so he started to investigate Zhang Ming, who always hated his father, but after being discovered, coupled with the fact that Zhang Han had offended many people before, he was kicked out of Zhang family.It had already been five years and Zhang Han was unwilling to leave, so he wanted to investigate this matter thoroughly. His days were tough, but he persisted to the point, until the incident in Mount Lang Xing.He remembered that back then when he was driving in the Mount Lang Xing, he had sustained heavy injuries and lost both arms. He had panted for five years before jumping off a cliff, but he didn\u2019t expect to enter the cultivation world by accident.When he first came into contact with cultivation, Zhang Han immediately awakened his innate divine ability \u2014 \u2014 Treasure-sniffing nose.Relying on this ability, Zhang Han forcibly piled up his cultivation using various kinds of treasures in the span of five hundred years.But who would have thought that when transcending the heavenly tribulation, he would be too weak to withstand a single blow due to his unstable foundation.\u201cWhy not five years ago?\u201dZhang Han\u2019s expression turned lonely.Before his relatives left, he, as a young man, was too young and too insolent. He had caused his father a lot of trouble, and he even said a lot of things that would make his mother sad.Although Zhang Han had been rebellious back then, the love he had for his parents was not inferior to others.Even if it was during the next five hundred years of cultivation, Zhang Han would always think of one sentence:The tree wants peace but the wind does not stop, the child wants to raise but parents are not alive.\u201cZhang Han!\u201dA gloomy voice interrupted Zhang Han\u2019s thoughts, raising his head, he saw Liu Feng staring at him coldly.\u201cFive years ago, you chased me out of the Shang Jing City! Five years later, I, the Los Angeles car king Liu Feng, return in a strong manner, but you, Zhang Han, will be worse off than a pig or a dog! \u201cRemember, I, Liu Feng, will let you, Zhang Han, walk out of the Shang Jing City today!\u201d\u201cOh, so powerful?\u201d Zhang Han asked in shock and rejected. \u201cThen I won\u2019t compete.\u201dLiu Feng was immediately startled, and the muscles on his face trembled. He felt as if a fist had just struck air, and the thief felt uncomfortable.\u201cZhang Han! I\u2019m putting a little bonus on you for this contest. \u201d Liu Feng shook the Ferrari key in his hand, and said: \u201cAs long as you win, this car is yours.\u201d\u201cThen I will find it hard to refuse.\u201d Zhang Han said with a beaming smile.\u201cHeh.\u201dLiu Feng sneered, he raised his hand and ordered everyone present: \u201cSet up the screen!\u201dWith that word, the people behind him set up several television screens, and at the same time, remote control aircrafts rose up from various parts of Mount Lang Xing. Opening the screen, one by one, the cameras on the remote control aircraft returned, shining the entire Mount Lang Xing within.\u201cGet ready!\u201dLiu Feng secretly nodded to the Fatty man who was sitting behind the wild horse and sat on the Ferrari.However, just as Zhang Han was about to enter the Ford Mustang, a timid and childish voice came from behind:\u201cDaddy, Come on, Beat the bad guys.\u201dZhang Han was startled, he turned his head and saw the little princess standing beside the fatty\u2019s feet.\u201cWhy would such a cute girl casually call someone \u2018dad\u2019?\u201dZhang Han laughed and shook his head.\u201cElder brother Han, you will definitely win!\u201d The fatty clenched his fists towards Zhang Han, showing an encouraging expression.\u201cWith your blessings, your car will bring me luck.\u201d Zhang Han looked at him indifferently, then sat in the wild horse carriage.A tall beauty wearing a bikini walked to the front of the two cars with two small flags in her hands and raised them high.\u201cGet ready!\u201dThe engines of the two cars roared angrily at the same time.Inside the Ferrari, Liu Feng\u2019s mouth formed a proud smile.The fatty behind revealed a meaningful smile.At his feet, the adorable princess\u2019s eyes were filled with fear and worry. Tears welled up in her eyes.And Zhang Han who was inside the wild horse carriage had a cold smile hanging on the corner of his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019re colluding to harm me?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, I am no longer the one of the past.\u201d\u201cEven if I don\u2019t have any cultivation right now, how can you ants provoke me?\u201dLiked it?

The two cars are not even on the same level.\u201dAfter all, elder brother Feng has the strength of a professional gamer. But for Zhang Han, he hasn\u2019t touched a sportscar in five years, right?From the screen, Liu Feng\u2019s Ferrari was ten metres ahead of him after five seconds. Do not underestimate these ten metres.In the first half of the winding road, the two cars drove through various fine drifts one after the other. As far as the mountain top, one could hear the sound of tires rubbing against the ground.\u201cLiu Feng is worthy of being the car king of Los Angeles. He has his own unique understanding and talent.A bald middle-aged man in his middle age was in discussion. He was a professional sports car commentator. As he was talking, he suddenly exclaimed in surprise:\u201cEh? Who would have thought that Zhang Han\u2019s drifting was much better than Liu Feng\u2019s. He truly has the ability to be proficient in terms of distance and strength! \u201dFrom the camera, the speed and precision of the blue Ford Mustang was smoother than Ferrari\u2019s.Gradually, the distance between the two cars grew closer and closer. Seeing that the Mustang was about to overtake him, Ferrari began to sway from side to side, entering a sharp position.This also slowed down the progress of the Mustang.\u201cYes, Liu Feng\u2019s skill is not bad. It\u2019s just that he has to pay attention to the following long bend. If he is not careful, he will get overtaken.\u201d The baldy stared at the screen and said.The two cars followed one after the other into the long bend in the road. As they moved about, Liu Feng controlled the car, not allowing Zhang Han\u2019s car to pass by.After seeing this, the baldy praised, \u201cNot bad, not bad. This move is very eye-catching.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, after all, he\u2019s my elder brother Feng!\u201d\u201cHow can a trifling Zhang Han be a match for the elder brother Feng?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNext is a straight stretch of track, after which, they will reach the last and most difficult part of the road in the Mount Lang Xing, the nine curves and eighteen turns.\u201d Next is a straight stretch of track, after which they will reach the last and most difficult part of the road in the Mount Lang Xing. The baldy stroked his chin as he spoke.Sure enough, the two cars entered the straight runway and sped forward at full speed.At this moment, a hint of a cold smile flashed across the eyes of the fatty who was standing in the corner.At the same time, within the wild horse carriage, Zhang Han\u2019s mouth had a similar smile.\u201cSure enough, the brake system is malfunctioning?\u201dIn his previous life, he was seriously injured while overturning the car at the bend of the road because he couldn\u2019t slow down. The reason for this was all because of his former brother, Dong Hu.A few years ago, he was a drifter who followed Zhang Han around due to luck. Although Zhang Han was young, he was still very kind to his little brother, and with his help, Dong Hu had managed to get a few jobs. He ran a used car shop, and had car houses in the Shang Jing. He had saved over five million, which made his life very comfortable.But five years ago, when something happened to Zhang Han, he did not greet her at all. It was only a few days ago that he had hypocritically contacted her about their relationship.\u201cHowever\u2026 Actually, I don\u2019t even intend to slow down! \u201dZhang Han laughed lightly.Normally speaking, it would be difficult to drift without a brake, but there was no absolute in this world. Zhang Han\u2019s precise control of his power could break this shackle.At this time, Liu Feng still kept controlling the car to Zhang Han\u2019s right until they reached the eighteen entrances of the Nine Winding Passage.\u201cYou found that you can\u2019t slow down?\u201dLiu Feng sneered, looking at the Ford that surpassed him, his eyes held a trace of anticipation for the destruction of the car.On the other end, the people watching carefully on the screen gasped in shock!\u201cHe\u2019s not slowing down? Did he not want to live? If you are not careful, you will fall off a cliff! \u201cThe bald man frowned.\u201cDamn, isn\u2019t Zhang Han too bold?\u201d\u201cI think he really has lived enough!\u201d\u201cIf he died early, then so would he. He probably got over it too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIn the corner at the back, the cute girl at Dong Hu\u2019s feet, could only see the legs of the many people in front of her, but after hearing everyone\u2019s ridicule towards Zhang Han, she started to cry as if she was wronged.\u201cDaddy \u2026\u201d\u201cShut up! \u201cStop crying and I\u2019ll hit you!\u201dDong Hu glared and bellowed.How could a three or four year old little girl understand so much? She cried even louder after being frightened by Dong Hu.Dong Hu\u2019s face was filled with anger, he raised his hand wanting to hit the little girl, but seeing that many people were looking at him from the side, Dong Hu retracted his hand and laughed awkwardly.\u201cWhat a cute girl.\u201dWhen a twenty year old woman saw the pitiful crying little princess, she couldn\u2019t help but run over to console her.\u201cWhat!?\u201d What did I see!? \u201dAt the front of the crowd, a cry of disbelief came from the bald man\u2019s mouth.The Ford didn\u2019t slow down at all as it charged straight into the nine corners and the eighteen bends! The first curve was a semicircle, and the Mustang turned and crossed it with an ornate drift, not slowing down to the second curve.The second curve was ninety degrees, and the third was a conical curve. Because the two curves were very close together, it was very difficult for them to fly out of the mountain at high speeds.In everyone\u2019s eyes, the Ford Mustang was still moving at full speed, just like a ghost chariot. It turned right around the second bend and entered the third.\u201cIt\u2019s over! This speed will not stop at all! \u201d The bald man sighed, pity in his eyes.However, the scene that happened in the next moment made him widen his eyes.He saw the Ford Mustang, which was speeding, spin at 360 degrees before it reached the third turn.After the first turn, the car entered the bend. The second turn, the car crossed the conical bend. After the third turn, the car had already started moving towards the fourth turn!\u201cMy, my god!\u201d\u201cWhat kind of driving skill is this?\u201d Three rounds and 360 degrees, how did he do it \u2026 \u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the first one to step into the Nine Winding Path and not slow down!\u201d\u201cZhang Han, he \u2026wants to write a legend of the Mount Lang Xing? \u201dEveryone was dumbstruck. They watched in amazement as the wild horses took beautiful turns, maintaining their full speed through all nine curves.After turning a corner, the Ford Wildhorse was like a running wild beast, quickly advancing forward.And at this time, Liu Feng\u2019s Ferrari gave off a feeling as if it were a snail, and only then did it slowly make its way past the fourth bend.A few minutes later, with a violent rumble, the Mustang pulled back onto the platform, still at full speed. At ten ornate 360 degrees, it stopped, facing the steep slope ahead.\u201cBam!\u201dZhang Han got off the car and leaned against the door. His body was still sloppy and his hair was still messy, to the point that his movements were the same as before.\u201c7 minutes and 30 seconds, this is a terrifying record, unprecedented.\u201d The bald man said in awe, \u201cIf he had also driven the Ferrari, the time would have shortened!\u201d\u201cMount Lang Xing\u2019s fastest record is 10 minutes 20 seconds, right? Heavens, Zhang Han is too strong! \u201d\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it. Ah, the elder brother Feng would have lost to him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone shook their heads and lamented, but Dong Hu\u2019s expression was extremely ugly. When he turned his head and saw the little girl, who was crying and calling out \u2018Daddy\u2019, his expression changed into a smile. Then he picked up the little girl and walked towards Zhang Han.\u201cAs expected of my elder brother Han, awesome!\u201dDong Hu flattered.\u201cHeh, your car is still the best. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to win.\u201d Zhang Han said with a light laugh.\u201cDaddy \u2026\u201dAt this time, the little princess in Dong Hu\u2019s embrace struggled nonstop. Her voice was soft and there were still tears hanging from the corners of her eyes.Zhang Han subconsciously held the Little Princess in his arms, let out a light laugh, and said:\u201cBeautiful girl, why do you call me Daddy?\u201dOn the other hand, the little girl was tired from crying, and after standing there for a long time, she fell asleep in Zhang Han\u2019s arms.\u201cIs this your daughter?\u201d Zhang Han asked indifferently.\u201cHow could I have such a cute daughter? Haha, elder brother Han, isn\u2019t she your daughter?\u201d Dong Hu said with a smile.\u201cHow could I have a daughter?\u201d\u201cThen I don\u2019t know. In short, you\u2019ve brought this little girl here, and she always calls you daddy. Didn\u2019t you ask me to take care of her just now? Did you forget?\u201d Dong Hu asked curiously.My daughter?Zhang Han\u2019s eyes that were hidden under her bangs focused, a daughter had appeared out of nowhere, what was going on?Before he could think much about it, Liu Feng\u2019s Ferrari drove back after a series of explosions.The car stopped by the side, and after a while, the pale Liu Feng got off.He stared at Zhang Han with thirty percent shock and seventy percent resentment, and walked over with large strides.At this moment, there was complete silence on the stage. Everyone\u2019s gaze was fixated on that spot.\u201cDo you dare to have another match with me!?\u201d Liu Feng said as he gnashed his teeth.\u201cHehe, I have no interest in wasting my time with a defeated opponent.\u201d Zhang Han smiled and said: \u201cHand over the car keys.\u201dHearing that, Liu Feng\u2019s eyes turned red, his right hand held the car key tightly as he said with hatred:\u201cWe\u2019ll have a match in a month!\u201dJudging from his posture, it was likely that he would not let Zhang Han go if he did not agree to it.\u201cFine, fine, fine. Give me the car keys.\u201d Zhang Han extended his hand.Liu Feng placed the car keys angrily into Zhang Han\u2019s hands, he had just bought a new car! At the first time it started running, it were courted by someone else.Zhang Han carried the keys to the red Ferrari and put the little princess who was in his arms on the front seat. He started the car and drove for a hundred meters before stopping by the roadside, looking at the side of the road through the rearview mirror.After the competition ended, the crowd left in small groups.Liked it?

    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - Daughter?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euDong Hu was currently apologizing and explaining something to Liu Feng. However, it could be seen that Liu Feng slapped each side of Dong Hu\u2019s face five times each. After slapping finish, Liu Feng entered into his friend\u2019s car and left.\u201cHow would I know that Zhang Han that rubbish would be able to win? I\u2019m sure that I definitely twinkled with the car! F**k!\u201dDong Hu cursed out in rage as he angrily entered into his Ford Mustang and step onto the pedal.\u201cVroom!\u201dThe Ford Mustang surged forward at high speed. But when Dong Hu stepped onto the brake, he discovered that the brake of the car that he twinkled with was indeed not working.Looking at the precipitous mountain slope that he was getting closer and closer to, Dong Hu\u2019s face turned deathly pale as his eyes contracted.\u201cBang, bang, bang\u2026\u2026\u201dThe acute sound of a car flipping resounded throughout the entire Wolf Mountain, causing the expression of others who were leaving to change as they turned over to look at what happened.A sneer hang up on the corner of Zhang Han\u2019s mouth as he started up the Ferrari and slowly drove out of Wolf Mountain.Right now, Zhang Han was currently living in a shabby apartment building at Shangjing City\u2019s Wuhuan road. On the journey towards the apartment, Zhang Han began to ponder.\u201cAs of now, I do not have even a trace of qi and I am currently not able to revolve any cultivation technique. Basically, I am but a mortal right now.\u201d\u201cMy spatial ring is gone too!\u201d There was a bit of heart pain in Zhang Han\u2019s expression, \u201cThe treasures that I have collected for 500 years are all gone!\u201d\u201cWretched Ninth Heaven God Thunder, since you let me rebirth, why didn\u2019t you give me some treasures too?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZhang Han mumbled to himself for a while and immediately stopped thinking about those thoughts afterwards. This was just how Zhang Han\u2019s character was, open-minded and optimistic. He would not be too obstinate about a matter. Of course, there was a line for everything. Once the line was crossed, Zhang Han would obstinately tackle the matter to the end. If not, he would also not had desperately remained in Shangjing City for five years and not be willing to leave.\u201cDo I still have any other treasures?\u201dZhang Han began to ponder. The number of treasures he had was beyond measure, even to the point that he somewhat could not remember how many treasures he possessed.Suddenly, Zhang Han\u2019s eyes lit up and he quickly raised his head as he moved his hand towards his left ear.After digging his left ear for a while, a thing that was about a cm long which looked like a needle tip was dug out.The needle tip\u2019s entire body was crystal white, seemingly just like an immortal jade. After looking at it for a while, the excitement in Zhang Han\u2019s eyes became denser and denser.\u201cNinth Heaven God Thunder, seems like you actually left me with a treasure in the end! Thunder-Yang Tree and a few seeds. Those are exactly the things I needed for me to get into cultivation!\u201d(The \u2018Yang\u2019 of Thunder-\u2018Yang\u2019 Tree is the \u2018yang\u2019 of yin and yang.)In the large Cultivation World, Thunder-Yang Tree was also a relatively rare treasure. Its abilities were very formidable. Apart from it being an energy source and being able to nourish spiritual medicinal herbs, it could also grow out Thunder-Yang Wood. Thunder-Yang Wood was a kind of wood which was necessary for a lot of medicinal pills. Even if a person was to waste the wood and directly absorb the wood\u2019s energy, the energy of the wood itself would also be able to enable the person to reach into the Xiantian Realm in an instant.\u201cHowever, Thunder-Yang Tree is only able to grow out Thunder-Yang Wood once every hundred years. Right before I rebirth and was undergoing the Heavenly Tribulation, I remembered that it was about to grow out Thunder-Yang Wood. So, it should take about five years for the Thunder-Yang Wood to grow out.\u201dZhang Han shook his head, \u201cForget about it. No matter how long it takes, the first thing I have to do is to find a good place to plant the Thunder-Yang Tree and absorb the energy that it erupts out for the first time. After absorbing the energy, I will be able to reach Qi Refining Realm. At that time, I will be able to use my Treasure Smelling Nose. Adding on those seeds that I placed within the Thunder-Yang Tree, my future seems bright!\u201dWhile thinking about it, Zhang Han could not help but start laughing.The sound of Zhang Han\u2019s laughter woke up the little princess who slept for a while.After waking up, the little princess rubbed her eyes adorably and looked at Zhang Han muddle-headedly as she said in a sweet voice,\u201cDaddy, I\u2019m hungry.\u201dZhang Han\u2019s laughter came to a halt as he turned his head to look at the little princess. For a moment, he actually forgot about this little girl.\u201cLittle girl, I am not your father. We are about to reach my house. I will find something for you to eat later.\u201d Zhang Han said as he curled his lips.Upon hearing that, the little princess had a look of feeling wronged and shyness. She wanted to talk, but at the same time did not dare to talk. She did not understand why her daddy said that he was not her daddy.With the Ferrari parked below the old apartment, there was a kind of inharmonious feeling when seen by others. Carrying the little princess upstairs and entering into his room, it could be seen that not only were the furniture old and shabby, the room was also disordered and in a mess. Only the small blanket on the bed and the pink suitcase at the bedside were new.What is the situation?Zhang Han\u2019s brows twitched. Sitting down on the sofa, he placed the little princess on the coffee table in front of him and examined her in detail.The little girl\u2019s face was exquisite. She had pretty brows, small and delicate nose, big lustrous eyes, cherry lips which were as thin as a willow leaf and the adorableness and gracefulness of a princess. However, her five sense organs did not resemble Zhang Han\u2019s masculinity.(Five sense organs refers to nose, eyes, lips, tongue, and ears.)However, it was also lucky that she did not resembled Zhang Han\u2019s masculinity. Otherwise, if a little young lady was to look masculine\u2026Eh, just the thought of it would give one goosebumps.\u201cThis is really my daughter? It can\u2019t be right?\u201dZhang Han mumbled to himself, when all of a sudden, a tearing pain bubbled forth in his mind.This was the surging forth of 20+ years of memories!At this moment, Zhang Han also understood everything. It turns out that when his 500 years of memories rushed into this body of his, it momentarily suppressed the 20+ years of memories of the body and it was only now then did all the memories started merging together.After absorbing the 20+ years of memories of this current life of his, Zhang Han was somewhat stupefied.Why did the course of development changed in this life?In his previous life, his parents and sister met with an aviation incident and died. But right now, within his memories, his parents instead disappeared bizarrely five years ago, his second uncle Zhang Ming still hated his entire family, his sister ran away from home and her whereabouts were unknown. However, his sister would transfer money to him every month. And as for himself, he was still chased out of Zhang Family by Zhang Ming just like in his previous life.\u201cCould this be god giving me a chance to make up for my regrets?\u201dThe feeling of joy could be seen in Zhang Han\u2019s eyes.After finish attaining those memories, Zhang Han also finally became aware of the origin of this little girl in front of him.Her mother was called Zi Yan. Zhang Han was not familiar with her and only knew that she was an aloof celebrity who had once starred in quite a few box-office movies. Five years ago when Zi Yan was about to reach the peak of her career, it was also the same time when Zhang Han had fallen into the abyss and reached the peak of hedonistic.After what that could be counted as an occasion of a hero saving a beauty, the two of them bonded together by accident. However, who would have thought that the \u2018bullet\u2019 that was shot out would be so accurate, and would have further even expected Zi Yan to choose to retire right when she was about to reach the peak of her career to hide at North America and give birth to the little princess that was currently in front of Zhang Han.Right when this little princess was about to reach four years old, she began quarreling that she wants her father. At that time, Zi Yan had the intention to come back out of retirement and go back into the entertainment industry, and thus came back to China.Upon reaching China, Zi Yan straightforwardly brought the little princess to this shabby apartment and only gave the little princess seven days to stay with Zhang Han. Perhaps, Zi Yan was also trying to get the little princess to give up on this dispirited father of hers.When Zhang Han and Zi Yan met, because of Zi Yan\u2019s indifferent, it incited the pride within Zhang Han and two both of them had a big quarrel. In the end, Zi Yan gnashed her teeth and left, while Zhang Han was disdain towards this matter as he thought towards himself, \u201cCelebrities were nothing but actors only, what was she acting aloof for?\u201d Of course, this was the opinion of Zhang Han before rebirth.Today was the third day where Zhang Han\u2019s life was joined by the existence of the little girl.After confirming that the little girl was indeed his own daughter, Zhang Han\u2019s complexion changed greatly. As if he had been struck by lightning, he stared in a daze at the little girl and mumbled with grief:\u201cA child that doesn\u2019t have a handle?\u201d\u201cGod, are you playing a joke on me? How am I going to pass on my orthodox if my child doesn\u2019t have a handle?\u201dIn a moment, emotions surged up in him as he gloomily picked up a cigarette that was on the coffee table, lit it up and took a deep inhale with the cigarette.\u201cCough, cough, cough\u2026\u2026\u201dLittle princess started coughing after being choked by the cigarette\u2019s smoke.This caused Zhang Han\u2019s hand to come to a pause. Although he wanted a son to carry on his orthodox, the little girl was still in the end his own daughter. Zhang Han sighed as he extinguished the cigarette and stood up to go make a cup of milk for the little girl to drink.\u201cThank you daddy.\u201d The little princess said timidly.Looking at his daughter\u2019s shy look, Zhang Han sighed once again. If this was a son, he reckoned that the speaking style would be like this, \u201cDad, I am hungry. Don\u2019t daze anymore and quickly make a cup of milk for me.\u201dUnlike his daughter in front of him, who was shy and delicate.However, as quickly as those emotions of his came, those emotions also disappeared just as quickly. Shortly after, Zhang Han began to look attentively at the little girl who was currently gracefully drinking milk. Unknowingly, a trace of tenderness appeared in his expression.Having finished drinking the milk, the little girl placed the baby bottle onto the coffee table, then stretched out both of her slim and tiny arms while speaking in a cute voice:\u201cDaddy, hug hug.\u201dZhang Han carried her in his arms and the little girl let out a shy smile as she said happily:\u201cDaddy (??), you are my hero (??????), I love you (???).\u201dThe little girl did not mind that her father was sloppy and straightforwardly kissed onto Zhang Han\u2019s cheeks.In a moment, Zhang Han\u2019s heart was dissolved by the kiss.This kiss made Zhang Han felt warm and tenderness which he had not felt for a very long time.This kind of family love quickly filled the hollow of Zhang Han\u2019s five hundred years of lonesome.\u201cI finally have a child! A daughter it should be then. Isn\u2019t it said that a daughter is just like a considerate little cotton-padded jacket right?\u201dZhang Han began to laugh heartily.Although the little princess within his arms did not know why her daddy laughed, but seeing him laugh, the little princess also began laughing too.In a moment, the room was filled with laughter and comfort.\u201cDaughter, did your mother give you a name? Zhang Han asked gently.\u201d Even he himself also did not know that his masculine voice would actually be able to let out such a gentle voice.\u201cYes, mommy already gave me a name~\u201d The little princess raised her hand and pointed to herself as she spoke in a cute voice, \u201cI am\u2026am called Emily (???).\u201dAfter speaking, the smile which was originally on Zhang Han\u2019s face immediately disappeared, and even the muscle at the corner of his eyes could be seen twitching, revealing out just how dissatisfied he felt right now.\u201cEmily?\u201d Zhang Han said fumingly, \u201cThis woman is truly over!\u201dFor his daughter to not be surnamed Zhang, and even given an English name. Just what was the meaning of this?\u201cDaddy\u2026\u2026\u201d Seeing Zhang Han\u2019s expression, the little princess thought that he was being angry at her and tears quickly filled her eyes.\u201cHey, hey, hey. Don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry, daddy is not talking about you.\u201d Zhang Han quickly coaxed.\u201cDaddy, don\u2019t be angry\u2026\u2026\u201d The little princess said timidly.Zhang Han shook his head and said, \u201cDaddy just felt that your name is not good. Let\u2019s pick a new name for you instead okay?\u201d\u201cAll right, all right!\u201d Seeing that her daddy was not angry at her and was even going to pick a new name for her, the little princess became happy once again.\u201cWhat should you be called\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhang Han pondered, and in less than two seconds, he looked towards the little princess within his arms and said, \u201cYou name should be called Zhang Yumeng, and your pet name should be called Meng Meng. What do you think? Is the name nice?\u201dAfter finish speaking, Zhang Han looked at the little princess with a look of anticipation.However, the expression of the little princess in his arms began to hesitate,\u201cBut, but I still prefer Emily. That is the name mommy picked for me.\u201dZhang Han expression stiffed up as he said solemnly, \u201cThat won\u2019t do!\u201dBut just after finish saying those three words, because of the solemn expression on Zhang Han\u2019s face, the little princess\u2019s expression changed and it could be seen that tears were about to burst out from her eyes anytime soon.Upon seeing that, Zhang Han immediately changed his tone and said in a gentle voice, \u201cMy little darling\u2026\u2026\u201dLiked it?

    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - exercise gallPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euZhang Han quickly began to coax the little princess. At the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh in his heart,\u201cPeople said that women are made of water. But children are the ones that are made of water. Especially little girls.\u201dZhang Han who was experiencing the life of a father for the first time was currently sweating. Coaxing a child was truly a skill that needed to be trained.\u201cLittle darling.\u201d After coaxing finish, Zhang Han thought for a while and said, \u201cDaddy ask you a question. What race are you?\u201d\u201cI am\u2026\u2026Chinese.\u201d The little princess replied in a cute voice.\u201cThat\u2019s not correct though?\u201d Zhang Han said, \u201cYou see, you are called Emily, so aren\u2019t you a North American?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d The little princess was not satisfied by what Zhang Han said as she pouted her mouth and protested, \u201cI am\u2026\u2026Chinese. My hair is\u2026black! My eyes are\u2026black! They are all black! Black! I am a Chinese!\u201d\u201cIf you are a Chinese, then you can\u2019t be called Emily anymore though? Emily is a foreign name. So if you are called Emily, aren\u2019t you a foreign?\u201d Zhang Han coerced the little princess step by step.How would a child understand that much stuff? Upon hearing that, the little princess immediately protested,\u201cI\u2026\u2026am not a foreign! Emily is foreign, I don\u2019t want Emily anymore!\u201d\u201cHeh, heh, heh\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhang Han smiled just like a wretched old uncle and said, \u201cWhat are you called then?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d The little princess immediately went into a daze, not knowing how to answer.\u201cYou are called Zhang Yumeng, your pet name is Meng Meng.\u201d\u201cI.\u201d The little princess pointed to herself and said, \u201cZhang\u2026Yu\u2026meng\u2026Meng Meng, Meng Meng.\u201d\u201cCorrect!\u201d Zhang Han grinned and started laughing heartily as the little princess kept on repeating the words \u2018Meng Meng, Meng Meng\u2019.After succeeding making the little girl accept her new name, Zhang Han felt like he had just defeated a war.\u201cDaddy\u2019s clothes are too dirty, let Daddy go change first.\u201dZhang Han placed the little princess on the shabby sofa and walked to the front of the cloth wardrobe. After pulling open the zip of the cloth wardrobe, the scene that was within made the muscle of Zhang Han\u2019s face twitched endlessly.Within the decent size wardrobe, there were but only four or five set of clothes, and moreover, they were all dirty and old.Immediately after, Zhang Han\u2019s gaze swept through the entire shabby and messy room. At the end, his gaze reached to a mirror. Seeing just how incomparably sloppy he was through the mirror, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh,\u201cI actually forget that there was once a time when I was so sloppy\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I told the people of the Cultivation World that I, Han Yan Immortal Monarch was once in such a dire state, I reckon no one would believe me right?\u201dEver since he was a child, Zhang Han had been growing in an extremely wealthy family and his life\u2019s aim had always been to enjoy the best quality of things.Although he had been in a dire state for a certain period of time, but after coming into contact with the Cultivation World, Zhang Han\u2019s quality of life had been raised many times higher compared to when he was living on Earth.The place he stayed at was the Peerless Immortal Palace!The drink that he drank was the immortal wine that has been brewed for ten thousand years!The food he ate was the first-rate delicacies of the myriad worlds.Even when going out, the vehicle that he rode in was the Nine Dragon War Chariot! Everywhere it passed by, tens of thousands of people would prostate before it!However, looking at the current scene in the room, Zhang Han could not stand it anymore.\u201cMeng Meng, Daddy bring you go out okay?\u201d Zhang Han asked casually.\u201cAll right! Meng Meng likes to go out and play with Daddy!\u201d Meng Meng said happily.One must say, the learning capability of a child was truly extremely strong. Only after a while, Meng Meng had already memorized the name her father picked for her.Zhang Han smiled and shook his head as he began to pack all of Meng Meng\u2019s stuff into her suitcase.When opening the suitcase, Zhang Han was able to see the 100k rmb that was placed neatly in the corner of the suitcase.Those cash were left by Meng Meng\u2019s mother, Zi Yan. Of course, Zhang Han did not intend to use those cash. However, upon seeing those cash, it made Zhang Han think back to two days ago when he quarreled with Zi Yan.Zhang Han\u2019s opinion of celebrities in the past was that celebrities were but only actors. When quarreling with Zi Yan, he said out his opinion which caused Zi Yan to become immeasurably angry.But the Zhang Han right now did not have this kind of opinion. Because of how famous he was, his name \u2018Han Yan Immortal Monarch\u2019 was well-known throughout the Cultivation World. Speaking from the fundamental, he was no different from a celebrity.After packing finish Meng Meng\u2019s suitcase, Zhang Han took out some cash from within his bedside cabinet. From the looks of it, there was about 20k+ rmb. Those cash were banked to him by his sister. Because Zhang Han normally doesn\u2019t leave the house, as time passed, the money piled up.\u201cDaddy, are we not coming back?\u201d Meng Meng pointed towards the suitcase in Zhang Han\u2019s hand and asked.\u201cWe are not coming back. Daddy is going to bring you go enjoy life.\u201d Zhang Han carried the suitcase with his left hand and Meng Meng in his right hand.\u201cAlright, go enjoy life!\u201d Meng Meng raised her small arms and shouted out happily.After coming down from the apartment, Zhang Han first placed the suitcase in the trunk, then placed Meng Meng in the front passenger seat and helped her wear the seat belt. After finishing all those, Zhang Han drove the car straightforward.While driving, he saw a barber shop not far away and drove towards it.Upon reaching the barber shop, Zhang Han carried Meng Meng out of the car and walked towards the barber shop.When the staffs in the barber shop saw this father and daughter combination, they all felt somewhat strange and thought to themselves,\u201cA sloppy old uncle and an adorable little princess pairing up together\u2026What a strange combination. Or could it be child trafficking?\u201dHowever, when the barber finished cutting Zhang Han\u2019s hair, everyone\u2019s eyes all lit up.\u201cThis guy\u2019s appearance seems quite full of spirit\u201dEveryone all thought to themselves.After losing the covering from his hair, Zhang Han\u2019s blade-like face gave others a kind of spirited aura feeling. Although his looks was not that of a super handsome guy where others would turn their head to look at him when passing by each other, but his face still belonged to the kind which was quite decent.\u201cDaddy, so cool (??).\u201d The little princess who had been shyly sitting on the chair at the side praised.Zhang Han smiled as he shook his head. After paying for the haircut, Zhang Han carried Meng Men and walked out of the barber shop.After getting on the car, Zhan Han said with a serious face,\u201cMeng Meng.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cWhen you are outside, your guts have to be bigger. You are I, Zhang Han\u2019s daughter. Whatever that you want to do, you can just do it. Even if you pierced through the sky, your daddy will also be able to help you fix it. Do you understand?\u201d Zhang Han earnestly taught Meng Meng.\u201cOh. Daddy\u2026But the sky is too high. I\u2026I cannot reach it.\u201d Meng Meng said adorably.\u201cOh, this is nothing. In the future when daddy bring you along and fly to the sky, you will be able to reach it.\u201d Zhang Han smiled and said casually, \u201cDaddy is only telling you that, no matter where you are, you don\u2019t have to be afraid of anything. Whatever that you want to say, you can just say it. Wait a while later when we reach the shopping mall, daddy will teach how to train you guts.\u201d\u201cAlright! Go shopping mall! Train guts!\u201d Meng Meng said as she raised her small hands.Thus, Zhang Han brought Meng Meng to a shopping mall in the vicinity.At the shopping mall, Zhang Han bought a white shirt, black leisure jacket, a pair of leisure shoes and a set of washed new clothes. The two set of clothes were all international brand and it cost him a close to a total of 20k rmb. This was still after Zhang Han picked the clothes that he was not satisfied with.A human depends on his clothes and a horse depends on its saddle. After changing into the new clothes, Zhang Han\u2019s entire temperament raised up some degree. The feeling he gave others right now was that of a successful figure bringing his adorable daughter to shop at the shopping mall.Before leaving the shopping mall, Zhang Han said to the little princess,\u201cMeng Meng, we are going to practice your guts for a bit now.\u201d\u201cOkay! Practice!\u201d Meng Meng replied while lying in Zhang Han\u2019s embrace.\u201cNow, look at those people in front of you Meng Meng, and loudly say to them, \u2018You bunch of insects, don\u2019t you dare bark in front of me!\u2019 Come on, you can do it.\u201d Zhang Han encouraged.\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng pouted her mouth and was about to speak. But when she saw the crowd that were moving in front of her, and the many people who were looking at her, she immediately hid into Zhang Han\u2019s embrace and said shyly, \u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t dare.\u201dZhang Han\u2019s expression froze. Without choice, he started discussing with Meng Meng. In the end, under the entice of an ice cream, Meng Meng finally summoned up her courage as she blinked with her clear eyes and said in a big yet cute voice,\u201cYou\u2026You bunch of insects, don\u2019t you\u2026don\u2019t you dare bark in front of me~\u201dWhen those words came out, it immediately attracted the gaze of the people around Zhang Han and Meng Meng. Upon seeing Meng Meng, most of the people couldn\u2019t help but be captivated by Meng Meng\u2019s adorableness and laughed.\u201cEh\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing that so many people were looking at her, the little princess shyly hid her head within Zhang Han\u2019s embrace.Upon seeing that, Zhang Han helplessly stroke on Meng Meng\u2019s little head and thought in his heart, \u201cSeems like, to strengthen her guts is truly a difficult matter.\u201dContrary to the crowd, an aunt who saw the whole matter from the start to finish with her own eyes mumbled angrily at Zhang Han,\u201cWhat kind of teaching method is this? This is offending public morals! Public morals are truly degenerating with each passing day! This is truly unreasonable!\u201dUpon hearing that, Zhang Han also did not react to it. Letting out a gentle laughter, Zhang Han bought an ice cream for Meng Meng as her reward, then carried her out of the shopping mall.Actually, Zhang Han\u2019s intention was that he only wanted to teach Meng Meng be more courageous and have no need to be shy. However, being a father for the first time, he also do not know how to properly educate a child. If this goes on, it was reckon that Zhang Han would taught out a little devil.Luckily, Zhang Han\u2019s education was cut off by Zi Yan\u2019s visit few days later. But even so, through the few days of Zhang Han\u2019s education, later on in life, Meng Meng did a few actions which trolled him all over.However, Zhang Han did not mind even if he taught out a little devil. In his view, so what if he taught out a little devil? He intends to even make her daughter to be the most fortunate daughter in this world and the most fearless daughter!Driving the new Crimson Ferrari, Zhang Han brought Meng Meng to a five-star hotel that was called Ling Yue.With a sports car and upper-class clothing, although Zhang Han was carrying a little princess in his embrace, he still attracted the hotel\u2019s beautiful receiver\u2019s amorous glances.It could be seen that, if Zhang Han had any thoughts, the beautiful receiver would not mind going into a deeper development.But what they did not know was that, in Zhang Han\u2019s wallet, there was only a total of 6k+ rmb, which was also the entire amount of money he had right now.However, even though he did not have much left, he still confidently spend 2.8k rmb for a luxurious suite.\u201cWill just have to make do with this for now.\u201dZhang Han was somewhat heartache that he could not stay in the Peerless Immortal Palace anymore. However, his words made the expression of the beautiful receiver\u2019s expression at the side froze.Alright, so staying in a luxurious suite is counted as making do. Truly, comparing oneself to other people will only make one feel vexed.The beautiful receiver personally leaded Zhang Han to his luxurious suite. On the way, she kept on casting amorous glances at Zhang Han. No matter what, it would definitely be beneficial making friends with a rich man.However, the little fellow was too vigilant already. Right now, the shyness that she had was all gone. Glaring with her big eyes while tightly hugging onto Zhang Han, she said,\u201cThis is my daddy. You\u2026don\u2019t come too close.\u201dAlthough the little fellow did not understand that much things, she understood that apart from her mother, any women who attempted to get close to her father and try to snatch her father away were all bad women.\u201cPfff\u2026\u201dThe beautiful receiver couldn\u2019t help but laughed lightly. Without choice, she maintained a distance away from Zhang Han.Upon reaching the room, Zhang Han properly placed the suitcase, then carried Meng Meng to the western restaurant at the second floor to eat dinner. At the western restaurant, he ordered a well done steak for Meng Meng and a medium well for himself.Although Zhang Han did not have not any experience with parenting, but he still understood small general knowledge. The immune system and digestive system of children were not that good and thus was not suitable for eating steaks that were not well done.Liked it?

But when cutting into the steak, it was still very hard for her to cut.\u201cLet daddy help you cut.\u201d Zhang Han smiled while shaking his head.\u201cOh\u2026I want\u2026small small one.\u201d Meng Meng reminded Zhang Han.\u201cSure, small small one.\u201dZhang Han cut up the steak into small cubes. Afterward, the father and daughter both began their somewhat high-class dinner since they first met.After eating finish, Zhang Han\u2019s phone rang. Picking up the phone, it was a call from Liu Feng\u2019s subordinate, calling to inform Zhang Han that the series of procedures for the car have all been prepared finish.Half an hour later, after meeting with the subordinate at the hotel, Zhang Han kept the documents, then went to the parking lot to take pictures of the Ferrari. Back to the room, he straightaway used his phone to post the Ferrari for sale on a second-hand car website.The price on the post for the Ferrari was only 2million rmb.At this side, after Zhang Han posted the post, on the other side, one of the employees of the website company who was currently preparing to get off work suddenly saw the post.As the employee scrolled through the post, his eyes became bigger and bigger as he started shouting, \u201cManager! Manager!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d The manager wrinkled his brow as he spoke in a dissatisfied tone.It was already 7pm night currently. The time to leave work had been delayed by 2 hours and yet his subordinate was still making a big fuss. With everything adding together, the manager could not help but felt annoyed. He had already decided that if this subordinate of his was shouting for nothing, he was prepared to punish him.\u201cManager, quickly come and take a look at this! There is a serious matter!\u201d The employee shouted, and his shouting voice immediately attracted the attention of everyone who was just about to leave. All of them turned their head to look at the employee.The manager wrinkled his brows as he hurriedly walked over. When he saw the post on the screen, his eyes opened wide open as exclaimed,\u201cWhat? A Ferrari 488 that has been bought for less than a month is only being resold at 2million rmb?\u201dThe manager\u2019s words caused everyone to gather around to take a look at the screen.\u201cThe total cost of this car is around 4.8million rmb, and someone is only reselling it at 2million rmb? Is it fake or real?\u201d\u201cIf it is real, then whoever who buys it will definitely profit from it!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. After buying it at 2million rmb, one can resell it for at least 3million rmb!\u201d\u201cCould this person be in urgent need of money? Even if he is urgent for money to use, isn\u2019t this somewhat negligent of him? Even if he posted it for 3million rmb, I reckon it would also be able to be sold within less than 3 days.\u201dAll of those people understood the price of the Ferrari, so naturally, the manager himself also understood. The manager quickly instructed the employee in front of the computer,\u201cQuickly, quickly, quickly! Quickly seal away this post and pass me the vehicle owner\u2019s phone number!\u201dThe manager was currently prepared to personally buy the car. While the employee in front of the computer hurriedly gets working, the other employees all looked at the general with envy.This was also the strength of the manager. After all, the manager had the money to buy and resell the car. If it was them, they do not even have 2million rmb, so even they want to buy and resell, they would also not be able to do it.After the manager called Zhang Han\u2019s number and discussed finish when to meet to take a look at the car, he laughed heartily as he pats onto his subordinate\u2019s back, intending to award him heavily after he sealed the deal with Zhang Han.The manager prepared for a bit, then brought few of his car examining subordinates to the hotel where Zhang Han was at.After a series of examining, the satisfied manager made an appointment with Zhang Han to deal the car tomorrow.After finishing all those, when Zhang Han carried Meng Meng back to the room, it was already 9pm.\u201cYawn.\u201d Meng Meng yawned while lying within Zhang Han\u2019s embrace, then mumbled, \u201cDaddy, I want to listen to story.\u201dListen to story?Zhang Han went into a daze. He had never told a story for anyone before. But since his daughter wanted to listen to story, he of course had to do it. After arranging the story within his mind, he said,\u201cDaddy will tell you the story of Snow White then. The story is like this, once upon a time, there was a Snow White\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh\u2026Don\u2019t want, don\u2019t want. I\u2026I listened to Snow White before already.\u201d Meng Meng shook her head and rejected.\u201cEh\u2026Then, how about daddy tell you the story of Little Red Riding Hood\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want.\u201d\u201cThen, daddy tell you the story of Seven Little Dwarfs\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want.\u201d\u201cThen, daddy tell you the story of Big Bad Wolf\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dZhang Han said out all the 10+ fairy tale story that he knew within his mind, but in the end, the little fellow had already listened before many times to all of those stories already and kept on shaking her head, saying \u2018Don\u2019t want\u2019.In a moment, Zhang Han was somewhat at a loss.After thinking for a while, suddenly, Zhang Han\u2019s expression lit up as an idea came to his mind. With a discussing tone, he asked, \u201cDarling, do you want to listen to the story of Han Yan Immortal Monarch?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026Eh?\u201d Meng Meng went into a daze. After pondering for a while and discovering that she had never heard of the story before, she clapped her hands and said happily, \u201cAlright, alright!\u201d\u201cHeh, heh, heh.\u201dZhang Han cleared his throat, and with a trace of complacent hang on his face, he said,\u201cHan Yan Immortal Monarch is an incredibly awesome person. The story of Han Yan Immortal Monarch still has to start from Earth.\u201d\u201cWhen Han Yan Immortal Monarch was on Earth, his life was not going as planned and he led a very miserable life. In the end, he jumped down from a precipice. But who would have thought that he would instead enter into a whole new world by accident? The world that he entered by accident is called the Cultivation World!\u201d\u201cOh\u2026Daddy, what is a Cultivation World?\u201d Meng Meng asked somewhat muddle-headedly.\u201cCultivation World is an extremely big world. Within it, there is a countless number of planets and people. In some places, even a river was bigger compared to Earth, and in some places, a mainland was almost comparable to the Milky Way. In any way, Cultivation World is an extremely peculiar world.\u201d\u201cHan Yan Immortal Monarch was very powerful in the Cultivation World. From the beginning when he came into contact with the Cultivation World, he only used 500 years to become a big shot that was in the Tribulation Realm. How was he able to do it? That is because that he has an innate magic power, which was known as the Treasure Smelling Nose that was able to small the aura of a treasure. Ever since then, Han Yan Immortal Monarch has never lacked any treasures at all.\u201d\u201cAlthough 500 years was very long, but in those 500 years, Han Yan Immortal Monarch was either searching for treasure, or on the journey to searching for treasure. Furthermore, he also had to study the unusually complicated cultivation method. In a flash, 500 years had passed. The number of people he had come into contact was very few and he also did not have any friends, thus he was very lonely.\u201d\u201cHowever, in the last few years, Han Yan Immortal Monarch cultivated to the peak of Tribulation Realm. Before the Heavenly Tribulation befell him, he went to travel around the myriad worlds. In the end, do you know what happened? He immediately became famous!\u201d\u201cHe squandered money like dirt. The tip that he gave to others was enough for others to spend for few hundred years. Therefore, later on wherever he went to, he was the center of everyone\u2019s attention. Everyone who saw him would flatter and worship him. That kind of aura, is it domineering or not?\u201d\u201cDomineering\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng was sort of confused listening to Zhang Han\u2019s story and answered subconsciously.\u201cBecause of this, everyone all gave Han Yan Immortal Monarch a nickname, which was Money Scattering Immortal Monarch.\u201dHaving received her daughter\u2019s praise, Zhang Han\u2019s mouth could not help but smile constantly.\u201cHowever, later on, his nickname was upgraded to Wealthy Emperor Immortal Monarch because he was just too wealthy already. His wealth alone was able to compete against the total wealth of a hundred super sects added together!\u201d\u201cThere were also some people who love to call him Treasure Virtue Immortal Monarch because every time when a treasure appeared, he would always be there, and the treasure would also be his too in the end.\u201d\u201cHan Yan Immortal Monarch had many nicknames, so Daddy won\u2019t talk about it anymore. Other than searching for treasures, it seems that Han Yan Immortal Monarch also did not do much. In the 500 years of cultivation, he only showed his capability once. During that time, it could be said that the sky and earth were turning upside down. Han Yan Immortal Monarch suppressed ten super sects at the same time. His strength was truly incomparable.\u201d\u201cHowever, no matter how strong he was, he was also not able to avoid the Heavenly Tribulation. When he was undergoing the Heavenly Tribulation, he was met with the legendary Ninth Heaven God Thunder. He took out countless amount of treasures, but in the end, he was still not able to block against the Ninth Heaven God Thunder.\u201d\u201cTherefore, he got rebirth and came back to Earth.\u201dSpeaking up to here, with a smiling face, he turned his head towards Meng Meng and said complacently,\u201cDo you know what Han Yan Immortal Monarch\u2019s name was? Haha, let me tell you, Han Yan Immortal Monarch is your dad, I, Zhang\u2026\u2026Eh?\u201dWhen he turned over his head, he instead saw that the little princess was asleep. Upon seeing that, his face froze. He felt that he was currently just like a teenager with chuunbyou syndrome who was being complacent.If this situation was to be seen by those people in the Cultivation World who were well acquainted with Han Yan Immortal Monarch, it would most likely topple their Three Views.(?? : Three Views \u2013 refers to view of the world, view of value, and view of life.)The corner of Zhang Yan\u2019s mouth twitched as he cover a blanket onto the little princess. Looking at his adorable daughter, the twitching at the corner of his mouth gradually changed into a warm smile.\u201cNext, I have to look for a treasure land to plant the Thunder-Yang Tree and those seeds.\u201dZhang Han shook his head and started pondering.There was no problem with the treasure land. With Thunder-Yang Tree, even if the land wasn\u2019t a treasure land, under the Thunder-Yang Tree\u2019s nourishment, it would also be able to gradually become a treasure land. The key point now was to look for a good location.\u201cWhere should I go?\u201dZhang Han lied down, took out the black color apple phone that her sister mailed to him and started searching China\u2019s map.After searching for a while, his gaze stopped at a location at the south of the map.Xiangjiang!Although it seemed like Zhang Han casually pick it, but it was actually picked after layer upon layer of consideration.Winter was approaching and the temperature of areas at the north was gradually decreasing. Thus, staying at the north was not suitable for Meng Meng to play around.For Shangjing City, it was where Zhang Family\u2019s nest was situated at. Although Zhang Family was declining, but Zhang Family\u2019s branches were pretty much everywhere at Shangjing City and Zhang Han did not intend in living under Zhang Family\u2019s eyes.At the east side, Lin Hai was where his mother\u2019s family was situated at. He recalls that back then his mother married over to Zhang Family, his mother had some unpleasant quarrels with her family. Moreover, it seems that his mother\u2019s family also does not accept him and his sister.Leaving aside the matter of all those big cities, there were still a lot of other places with green hills and clear waters for him to choose. However, Zhang Han chose Xiangjiang.Speaking frankly, everything were all but excuses. The reason Zhang Han chose Xiangjiang was solely because Meng Meng her mother\u2019s company was at Xiangjiang. Currently, Meng Meng was still not entirely his.After settling things with Zi Yan, when the time comes, he would be able to bring Meng Meng to wherever that he wanted.Zhang Han was not optimistic about his relationship with Zi Yan. Leaving aside his identity as Han Yan Immortal Monarch, even the him before also was not optimistic about the relationship with Zi Yan.The entertainment industry was too complicated already. With Zhang Han\u2019s identity of being one of Shangjing City\u2019s four young master, he naturally knew quite a bit of what happens behind the scene of the entertainment industry. Just how many young girls in the prime of their youth sacrificed everything they had to climb up to the top? And just how much trails and hardships have famous celebrities experienced? Within the eyes of the rich, just how many celebrities were nothing but plaything within their eyes?In Zhang Han\u2019s view, the entertainment industry was just like a big dye jar where most of the people within it had already been dyed. Although Zi Yan was one of the famous celebrities who practically did not have any scandal, but this does not mean that Zhang Han would change his view.\u201cLet\u2019s have a trip of coming and going whenever I want.\u201dZhang Han smiled as he looked at Meng Meng who was sleeping soundly, then immediately used his phone to book airplane tickets online.The tickets he booked was for the flight at tomorrow evening. However, when he the payment section, he was stupefied.Within all of his credit cards, all of them did not even had a cent in it at all. Without choice, he could only wait for tomorrow to go deposit money first, then buy the tickets afterward.While thinking, with a \u2018ding\u2019, the message notification of his phone rang out.Opening his phone to take a look, he discovered that 5k rmb was deposited into his bank.Zhang Han\u2019s expression froze for a moment, then immediately booked the airplane tickets.Soon after, he got up and walked to the toilet. After closing the toilet door, he dialed Zhang Li\u2019s phone number.\u201cLi Li, I just received your money.\u201d Zhang Han said.\u201cOh.\u201d Zhang Li responded.(Li Li refers to Zhang Li and is a more intimate way of calling Zhang Li. Instead of the repeating of a part of a person\u2019s name, like Li Li or Meng Meng. Sometimes, the word \u2018Xiao\u2019 maybe also be added to the front of a part of a person\u2019s name. For example, if it is in Zhang Li\u2019s case, it would most of the time be Xiao Li, or otherwise Xiao Zhang. It is basically a more intimate way of calling someone.)Although it sounds as if that Zhang Li was not interested in talking, but Zhang Han knew that his sister actually cares a lot about him.Five years ago when their parents disappeared, Zhang Li believed that it was because of Zhang Han stirring up troubles for years that caused it, and thus left Zhang Family and did not even contact Zhang Han for more than a year.It was only until later on when Zhang Li found out that Zhang Han was not willing to leave Shangjing City because he wants to stay at Shangjing City to investigate the matter and was living a very dire life, then did she began contacting Zhang Han once again.Liked it?

Right after that, I received the money you send to me.\u201d Zhang Han said with a faint laugh.\u201cOh\u2026\u2026Eh?\u201d Zhang Li said in astonishment, \u201cBuy airplane ticket? Brother, could it be that you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I am intending to go somewhere else.\u201d Zhang Han said.\u201cYou are finally willing to leave Shangjing City?\u201d Zhang Li\u2019s voice was trembling, and there was happiness in her tone.\u201cThat\u2019s right. It is just as you said, I would also not be able to investigate anything much by staying in Shangjing City like this. Once my strength becomes higher, everything will naturally come to light.\u201d Zhang Han said with a laugh.\u201cIt is good as long as you understand.\u201d Zhang Li\u2019s eyes turned red as she asked, \u201cWhere do you intend to go?\u201d\u201cXiangjiang.\u201d Zhang Han replied, \u201cYou should settle your things and come to Xiangjiang too. Come to Xiangjiang and enjoy life together with your brother me.\u201d\u201cI am currently at Xiangjiang.\u201d Zhang Li said slowly.\u201cOh. I will be taking the flight at tomorrow evening 6pm and will be reaching Xiangjiang International Airport at 9.30pm. You can come fetch me at that time.\u201d Zhang Han said.Zhang Li hesitated for a while, then replied, \u201cAlright then. Wait! You said that you booked two airplane tickets just now. Who are you coming with?\u201d\u201cWith my daughter.\u201dThump! Thump! Thump!The sound of a phone dropping on the floor could be heard, followed by Zhang Li\u2019s cry of astonishment, \u201cWhat did you say? Your daughter?\u201d\u201cYep. My daughter, which is also your niece.\u201d Zhang Han laughed while shaking his head.\u201cHow is it possible? Why do I do not know about it? Is it real or fake? You are not bluffing me?\u201d Zhang Li let out a succession of questioning.\u201cIt is of course true. Even I myself was somewhat shocked.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cMy\u2026god\u2026I am already an aunt?\u201d Zhang Li mumbled at a loss.\u201cYou will be able to see her when we meet tomorrow.\u201d\u201cNo, I want to see her now. Let me send you a video chat.\u201d After speaking finish, Zhang Li immediately hang up the phone.Followed after, a video chat invitation arrived in Zhang Han\u2019s WeChat.(WeChat is something like WhatsApp.)After connecting through, when Zhang Li saw the neatly dressed Zhang Han who seemed just like in the past, she was immediately stumped, and tears filled her eyes unconsciously.\u201cAlright, you are such a big person already, there is no need to cry.\u201d Zhang Han said with a smile.\u201cNo matter how big I am, I am still your little sister. Seeing you being able to pull yourself together, I am very happy.\u201d Zhang Li wiped her tears and adjusted her emotions, then said, \u201cWhere is my niece? Quickly let me see her.\u201dZhang Han walked to the bedside and adjusted the phone\u2019s camera lens right at the little princess who was currently sleeping soundly.\u201cWhat a pretty and adorable little girl!\u201d Zhang Li said tenderly, \u201cBrother, who is my sister-in-law? To be able to give birth to such a pretty child, she must also be very beautiful right?\u201d\u201cEh\u2026\u2026\u201d Being afraid to wake up Meng Meng from her sleep, Zhang Han replied softly, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it when we meet instead.\u201dDespite Zhang Han\u2019s voice being very soft, but the little fellow seemed to be able to hear his voice. Twisting around her little body, she kicked away the blanket with her little legs, revealing out her little legs and little buttocks which was still wearing a disposable diaper.Zhang Han tenderly covered the little fellow with the blanket again, then walked to a corner to continue chatting with Zhang Li. After chatting close to an hour, only then did he hang up the video chat.Walking back to the bed, Zhang Han took off his clothes and placed it on the side. Looking at the adorable little fellow at his side, Zhang Han gradually fell asleep. On this night, he had a very good sleep.The next day when the sun just came out, Zhang Han was woken up by a burst of crying sound.Whoosh!Zhang Han quickly opened his eyes and saw that the little fellow beside him was currently crying loudly.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter little daring. Don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry. Come, daddy hug.\u201d Zhang Han quickly hugged the little fellow in his embrace.\u201cBoohoo, boohoo\u2026Dad\u2026dy, there was\u2026was a big monster chasing after me. I\u2019m scared\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng cried.Upon hearing that, Zhang Han immediately understood what happened and said lightly, \u201cMeng Meng, it was only a dream. You were just dreaming.\u201d\u201cBoohoo\u2026I\u2019m scared\u2026\u201dAfter coaxing for a while and seeing that it was not working at all, he suddenly thought of an idea in a hurry. Raising his left hand and attracting the little fellow\u2019s attention,\u201cMeng Meng don\u2019t be scared. Big monsters are all stupid and ugly. Watch as daddy beat the big monster up! Ha! Watch this fist of mine! Bang! The monster\u2019s nose has been beaten crooked by me. Watch this two fingers of mine. Ha! The monster\u2019s eyes got hit away by me. Looking at this palm of mine. Smack! The monster got beaten to death with a slap from my palm!\u201dSeeing that the little fellow stopped crying after being attracted by his actions, Zhang Han let out a sigh of relief in his heart, \u201cAlright, the big monster has been beaten to death by daddy!\u201d\u201cWow, daddy is so powerful.\u201d There were still tear stains hang on Meng Meng eyes, but the crying had stopped. Looking at Zhang Han, she said with a somewhat worshipping tone.\u201cThat is only natural. Your dad is the most powerful.\u201d Zhang Han said proudly.\u201cDaddy, I\u2019m hungry. I want to drink milk.\u201d\u201cGive daddy a while, daddy go help you make milk.\u201d Zhang Han stood up and went to make a cup of milk for the little fellow.After making the cup of milk, the milk\u2019s fragrant was very faint. Zhang Han took a look at the powdered milk and laughed in disdain, then said, \u201cMeng Meng, wait after we settled down, daddy will raise a dairy cow and let you drink pure milk every day.\u201dAfter finish speaking, he passed the milk bottle over to Meng Meng. Taking over the milk bottle, Meng Meng drank a big mouthful, then asked confusedly,\u201cWhat is a dairy cow?\u201d\u201cDairy cow is a cow that can produce milk.\u201d Zhang Han explained, \u201cThe powdered milk that you are currently drinking is manufactured out by cow\u2019s milk. Little children all have to drink milk to grow up because there are lots of nutrition in milk.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I\u2026drank mommy\u2019s milk to grow up?\u201d Meng Meng asked confusedly.\u201cYour mother\u2019s milk is drunk by you when you were a year old. After a year old, you will have to start drinking cow\u2019s milk.\u201d Zhang Han replied.Luckily Zhang Han\u2019s view of family love was comparably high. If it was an outsider or some other family\u2019s child asking him question upon question, Zhang Han would most definitely say while feeling annoyed,\u201cAm I the great Han Yan Immortal Monarch supposed to be here to answer all your questions? Quickly scram to the side.\u201dBut towards his own daughter, Zhang Han had no choice but to answer all her question, while feeling both helpless and enjoyment in the process of answering Meng Meng\u2019s questions.Morning 9am, the manager of the second-hand car website arrived as planned. After finish dealing the car, Zhang Han rejected the manager\u2019s invitation to eating together.Back to the hotel, he threw away all the other bank cards in his wallet, leaving himself with the new card that had 2million rmb in it.There were quite a few things that auto-deducted fees from those few cards and Zhang Han also did not intend to use those things anymore.Afterward, Zhang Han and the little fellow remained in the hotel to wait for night to come and head to the airport.Under normal circumstances, when going to Xiangjiang, one had to set up their visa, and at the same time, they were not allowed to stay at Xiangjiang for too long. However, Zhang Han did not need to trouble himself with those minor details, because not only did he have a house at Xiangjiang, he also has the permanent residency of Xiangjiang. As someone who was once the young master of a rich and powerful family, if he was not able to even do those things, it would really be a joke.In the afternoon, while eating a simple lunch at the hotel\u2019s restaurant, Zhang Han looked at those food in front of him that seemed sumptuous and started considering that he should find a larger mountain to set as his base. If he were to personally grow the ingredients himself, it would definitely be much better than eating out at restaurants.\u201cMeng Meng\u2019s body is currently in the growing period and requires abundant of nutrition, thus the food she eat must be the best. Seems like I will have to prepare a detailed plan.\u201dCurrently, when Zhang Han ponder over things, he would start by pondering with Meng Meng as the basis. It must be said that, after having a daughter, Zhang Han\u2019s mindset has started to change.At 4pm afternoon, Zhang Han carried the little fellow and took a taxi to head to the International Airport. Arriving at 5pm, they stayed at the airport lounge to wait for the plane. It could be seen that the little fellow was very excited towards traveling.At Zhang Han\u2019s destination, Xiangjiang. Within one of the offices at Imperial Corporation\u2019s subsidiary company, Imperial Entertainment,\u201cBig sister Yan, you also don\u2019t have to be too anxious. After all, you just came back out of retirement, and because the company\u2019s competition is so fierce right now, it is impossible for the company to arrange plans for you in a short time.\u201d A woman with a ponytail said towards Zi Yan.\u201cI know.\u201dSitting at the sofa by the window, Zi Yan\u2019s exquisite face was filled with exhaustion currently. With her gaze looking out of the window, she shook her head and said,\u201cBut if I wait for the company to plan, I would have to wait for at least half a year or more before I am able to get a role in a show. The news about me coming out of retirement have already been reported out. If I were to not have any activity in this coming half a year, my fans will be very disappointed.\u201d\u201cPrince Li invited you to eat dinner at Amber Restaurant tomorrow. His father is one of the members of Imperial Corporation\u2019s board of directors. If he is to open his mouth, there will be no problems with getting a role in a show.\u201d The woman said.\u201cIt is not that simple.\u201d Zi Yan sighed while feeling vexed.The entertainment industry was a very complex place. For example, the motive of prince Li\u2019s dinner invitation was very obvious. If Zi Yan was to agree to whatever his conditions were during the dinner, the matter of getting a role in a show would be solved very quickly. But, was this kind of result the result that Zi Yan wants?Zi Yan had always rejected this kind of \u2018business deal\u2019. Back then when she signed a 5 year contract with Imperial Entertainment, she relied on her beautiful appearance and heart-touching voice, and after 3 years of hard work, along with the company\u2019s grooming, she became famous immediately.On the fourth year, she changed from a singer to an actress. During that year, the number of movies and shows that she was in were endless, causing her reputation to become greater and greater, even to the point that she had the chance to attack onto the title of \u2018Best Actress Award\u2019 during the fifth year. However, on the fifth year, the accident with Zhang Han happened.Originally, when Zi Yan was pregnant, she wanted to immediately retire, but her company did not allow it. Without choice, she persevered for a few more months until the contract with the company came to an end, then went to North America. Five years later when she returned to China, the entertainment industry was however already not how it used to be.The competition in the entertainment industry was much fiercer right now. Once again signing a contract with the company, which was a 3 year contract, the company also did not give her resources in a moment. After all, everyone was all queuing up for their turn to get resources, so it was not possible for a has-been celebrity to cut the queue.In the company, there were many people who pointed at her, and even time to time say out \u2018has-been celebrity\u2019 those 3 words, which even more made Zi Yan felt indignant, and thus causing Zi Yan to want to use her own strength to prove herself.\u201cBig sister, take a sip of water. We can definitely slowly do it, I believe you.\u201d The ponytail woman passed a glass of water over to Zi Yan and said.\u201cThank you, Xiao Fei.\u201d Zi Yan said with a slight smile.The ponytail woman\u2019s name was Zhou Fei. She was an orphan since young and suffered quite a bit when she became a manager after growing up. However, when she was working as Zi Yan\u2019s manager, she felt comfort and warm from Zi Yan, and thus became extremely faithful to Zi Yan. Even during the time when Zi Yan retired and went to North America to hide, she was also there with Zi Yan.Right now, not only was she Zi Yan\u2019s manager, she was also her assistant and housekeeper. Towards Zi Yan, she was very nice, but towards outsiders, she was somewhat harsh with her mouth.\u201cWhat are you being courteous to me for? Big sister, how about you release an album first? The company has recently gotten quite a few songs. You can go discuss with big sister Mei, I reckon she might agree to let you choose the songs, after all, you did indeed debuted through music.\u201d Zhou Fei said.\u201cLet\u2019s see how things go first.\u201dLiked it?

If the little fellow was to become sick because of hygiene problem, you will surely regret it.\u201d\u201cEmily is after all his daughter too. He\u2026will pay attention to the hygiene right?\u201d Zi Yan said with uncertainty as she took out her phone and dialed Zhang Han\u2019s phone number.Ring, ring\u2026The phone rang for 10+ times before it was connected. From the phone, her daughter\u2019s tender and cheerful voice could be heard, \u201cMommy, I miss you so much! (??,?????!)\u201dHearing her daughter\u2019s voice, the fidgety in Zi Yan\u2019s heart got swept away immediately and a smile which outsiders would hardly be able to see was hung on her face, as she said gently, \u201cEmily, are you happy playing at your father\u2019s place those few days?\u201d\u201cEh? Oh\u2026you, you called wrong, I am not Emily!\u201d\u201cWho are you then?\u201d Zi Yan said with a smile, thinking that her daughter was joking with her.\u201cI am\u2026Zhang\u2026Yumeng\u2026Meng Meng\u2026Meng Meng.\u201d Meng Meng\u2019s cheerful voice transmitted out from the phone.Hearing that, Zi Yan\u2019s expression went rigid as she thought to herself in a moment of panic, \u201cZhang Yumeng? He gave Emily a new name? Could it be that he wants to snatch Emily away from my side?\u201d\u201cWhy did you change your name?\u201d Zi Yan suppressed her emotion and asked.\u201cBecause, I am a Chinese, and Emily is foreign, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d\u201cOh, then did you have fun those few days?\u201d Zi Yan went into a daze for a while, then asked.\u201cYes. I am enjoying\u2026enjoying life with daddy.\u201dEnjoying life? Not bearing hardships while staying with him would be counted as good enough already!Zi Yan thought to herself.From the little fellow\u2019s tone, it could be discerned out that she was quite dependent on that wretched, bad temper and inflexible minded father of hers.\u201cHow are you enjoying life then?\u201d Zi Yan asked.\u201cEh\u2026\u2026Daddy, mommy asked how we are enjoying life\u2026\u2026\u201dMeng Meng did not know how to answer and quickly looked towards her father for help.Very quickly, Meng Meng\u2019s sweet voice once again transmitted out from the phone, \u201cDaddy said that, we are going to eat the best food, drink the best drink, and play the best thing. Oh\u2026in a while, I am going to sit the big bird too. Mommy, I have to hang up, I am going to go enjoy life with daddy already.\u201dAfter Meng Meng finished speaking, Zi Yan vaguely heard those few words from the phone, \u201cAttention, from Shangjing towards\u2026\u2026\u201dThen followed by the phone hanging up.At that moment, Zi Yan was in a daze.My daughter hang up on my call?Enjoy life?Bluffing little children with graceful words and flowery speech. Zhang Han, how are you going to enjoy life when you are wretched to that state?What was the meaning of that last sentence from the phone? Was he at a bus stop? Airport? Or somewhere else? With how obstinate he is, would he actually leave Shangjing?\u201cBig sister, big sister, big sister?\u201dAfter calling out for a few times, Zhou Fei then saw that Zi Yan turned her head towards her, and within Zi Yan\u2019s eyes, there was bewilderedness.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter big sister? What did Emily say? Did she had enough of staying there?\u201d Zhou Fei asked curiously.\u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d Zi Yan replied as she woke up from being dazed. Lowering her head, she felt upset in her heart.In the past, when she called her daughter on the phone, it would always be her coaxing her daughter to hang up the phone. But right now, the little fellow did not even ask her anything and straight away hung up the phone. This kind of change made Zi Yan\u2019s mood felt very terrible.\u201cIt is not early already, let\u2019s go back first.\u201d Zhou Fei took a look at her watch and said.At this time, Zi Yan raised her head and said, \u201cI\u2019m not going back. Xiao Fei, go and book the earliest flight to Shangjing now!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Zhou Fei went into a daze for a moment, \u201cBut, the company is holding 2 meetings tomorrow, and there is the matter of eating dinner with young master Li.\u201d\u201cPush off everything! We have to quickly bring Emily back. She\u2026\u2026\u201d Zi Yan took a deep breath, \u201cShe became bad!\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Zhou Fei nodded her head. She understood that anything that concerned the little fellow, Zi Yan would always say one and mean just that. Therefore, she quickly took out her phone to book the airplane tickets.Actually, Zi Yan misunderstood Meng Meng. Meng Meng actually still wanted to continue chatting with her mother, but the plane was about to take off. Zhang Han reminded the little fellow, and after the little fellow said goodbye to her mother, Zhang Han took over the phone and straight away hung up, which caused the little fellow to feel immensely dissatisfied.\u201cAlright Meng Meng, we have to go sit the big bird. After we reach our destination, you can continue chatting with your mother okay?\u201d Zhang Han said lightly.\u201cOh. Go and sit big bird, talk with mommy after we reach the destination!\u201d Meng Meng brandished her arms and legs while she was within Zhang Han\u2019s embrace.The little fellow was fond of riding airplane, because when riding an airplane, she would be able to see the cotton-candy-like clouds through the outside of the airplane\u2019s window.However, she was not able to see the cloud this time because the sky was already dark.At night, 9.30pm, the plane reached Xiangjiang International Airport right on time.Pulling the luggage with his left hand and carrying the little fellow with his right hand, Zhang Han walked out of the airport.At another side of the airport\u2019s entrance, Zi Yan who wore a mask and sunglasses was currently hurriedly heading towards the plane room with Zhou Fei. This trip of Zi Yan\u2019s was destined to be a waste.After walking out of the airport, Zhang Han\u2019s gaze swept around and finally, his gaze came to a stop at a woman within the crowd.The woman\u2019s appearance was somewhat similar to Zhang Han\u2019s appearance, only that her eyebrows were like willow leaves, and her nose and lips were much more small and exquisite. The woman was precisely Zhang Li, who had a height of 1.7m.Zhang Han smiled and walked towards Zhang Li. When Zhang Han came close to Zhang Li and Zhang Li saw Zhang Han who dressed neatly and had the graceful bearing that he possessed back in the past, her eyes became red all of a sudden.\u201cBrother.\u201dZhang Li cried out lightly as hurriedly walked up and entered into Zhang Han\u2019s embrace.\u201cBoohoo\u2026\u2026\u201d When Meng Meng who was very vigilantly looking at the woman who was looking face to face with her father saw that the two hugged together, she immediately started crying.\u201cAiyo, what\u2019s the matter Meng Meng?\u201d Zhang Han let go of his sister and quickly went to console the little princess.At this moment then did Zhang Li noticed Meng Meng. Seeing Meng Meng\u2019s adorable and sad little face, Zhang Li smiled and said, \u201cMeng Meng don\u2019t cry, be obedient. Later on, aunt will bring you to eat good things okay?\u201dWhile speaking, Zhang Li wanted to carry Meng Meng over from Zhang Han. But, who knew the little fellow raised her little hand to protest,\u201cYou go away, bad woman! Daddy belongs to me and mommy! Other people cannot hug daddy!\u201d\u201cPff\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhang Li went into a daze for a moment. Soon after, she could not help but start laughing out.Not knowing whether to laugh or cry at the situation, Zhang Han began explaining the meaning of \u2018aunt\u2019 to Meng Meng. After knowing that Zhang Li was her daddy\u2019s little sister, only then did the little princess\u2019s mood began to gradually improve.Originally Zhang Li wanted to treat them seafood, but Zhang Han immediately rejected it. Firstly, he felt that eating seafood was easy to cause children to have diarrhea. Secondly, he was not reassured about the restaurants outside. Even if they were to eat seafood, the seafood should also at least be personally prepared by him.Towards culinary delicacy, this aspect, Zhang Han\u2019s expectation was high to the extreme. He intends to personally cultivate ingredients for Meng Meng to eat after he planted the Thunder-Yang Tree. Before that, he can only make do with normal ingredients for Meng Meng for now.In the end, Zhang Han chose to eat at a pastry restaurant. While eating, Zhang Han found out that Zhang Li was working as a dj at a bar that was at Causeway Bay. Every week, only Sunday was her off day. (Do not take/compare the locations in the novel too seriously to real life location. In the raw, the location \u2018Causeway Bay\u2019 which is???, is written as ???.)(Note: Some of the locations in the novel do not exist in real life too.)Not speaking about how exhausting working as a DJ was, the working environment was also not really good, as crooks and honest folks were all mixed together in that kind of environment. Zhang Han did not want Zhang Li to continue working as a DJ, but Zhang Li said that working as a DJ was her hobby.Seeing that his persuasion was useless, Zhang Han did not talk about it anymore. After finish eating, it was already close to night 11pm and the little princess was already feeling sleepy. Zhang Li called for a cab and wanted to let Zhang Han go to her rented apartment to stay. But after Zhang Han learned that his sister was co-renting the apartment with someone else, he gave up the idea of staying at the apartment and told Zhang Li to instead stay together with him at Fushi Hotel which was at Causeway Bay.Of course, with Zhang Ham\u2019s life goal of enjoying life, he handed over 500k rmb advance payment and stayed at the president suite which cost 180k rmb per day.This caused Zhang Li\u2019s expression to freeze for a moment.\u201cSeems like brother\u2019s situation is not as bad as I imagined.\u201dHowever, followed after, Zhang Li got angry for a bit in her heart,\u201cAlright, fancy that I actually deposited 5k rmb to him every month and right now he actually casually take out 500k rmb. How was this even counted as his situation being bad? Seems like Zhang Family still has some conscience in the end and left him with a bit of money.\u201dEntering into the room, Zhang Han first placed the little princess who was asleep in the main bedroom. Afterward, he went back to the living room and explained simply about the matter of the car racing. After that then did Zhang Li knew where Zhang Han\u2019s money came from.The brother and sister had not seen each other for a few years and thus they naturally had a lot to talk about. They chatted until about midnight 1am before coming to a stop.While chatting, when Zhang Li asked about Meng Meng\u2019s mother, Zhang Han did not give a specific answer. Seeing that, Zhang Li also did not persist on with the question. After talking until she felt tired, she then went to the secondary bedroom to rest.Although Zhang Han was feeling drowsy, he had a much more important thing to do. Perking up his mind, he went to the computer table and opened up the computer.After taking out a pen from the drawer, he started to ponder.\u201cAfter the Thunder-Yang Tree is planted, I can consider a mountain as a domain and undergo nourishment for the mountain and transform the soil into spiritual land. Other than planting the other seeds, I can also plant some fruits and vegetables. However, I will have to consider how big the land should be. The bigger the land, the spiritual strength of the soil would be sparser. I have to first think about what I need. Eh, no, it should be about what Meng Meng need.\u201dZhang Han took the pen and started writing on a paper,\u201cMeng Meng needs to drink milk, so I will have to raise a dairy cow. Not only that, chickens, ducks, fishes and so on are also needed for eating. This area can be counted as the poultry area.\u201d\u201cMeng Meng\u2019s main foods are rice and wheat flour. Thus, I will have to grow rice and wheat. Fruits and vegetables are also needed too. An area should be used as the planting area then.\u201d\u201cFor the area at the mountain top, other than Thunder-Yang Tree and Yuanqing Tree those things which are required for cultivating, there is no need to plant other things there. This area should be used as the residential area then.\u201d\u201cThe poultry area and planting area will be placed at the back of the mountain. Oh, that\u2019s right, I can also raise some house pets for Meng Meng to play with. So, I will have to leave an area for the pet area.\u201d\u201cAt the mountain front, I can leave out an area for the amusement area. At the amusement area, I can build a swimming pool, golf course or something else there.\u201d\u201cThe place must also be pleasing to the eyes, so I will have to set up a viewing area too. At the viewing area, I can plant some beautiful flowers, plants and trees there. I can also get a giant fish tank and raise some uncommon fishes in it. Then, I can make a pond too to grow some lotus. Lastly, I can build an above water courtyard which would be a pretty nice place for viewing the scenery.\u201d\u201cIt would be best if I can also make a seawater area. However, it is quite difficult to make a seawater area. It is not something I should consider currently. Two area can be leave out as the reserve area and that should be enough. For the two reserve area, one will be at the mountain back and the other will be at the mountain front.\u201dAfter finish writing all those, Zhang Han began to read everything he had written to check if there was any problem. After finish reading, he immediately went into a daze.\u201cPoultry area, planting area, residential area, pet area, amusement area, viewing area, seawater area and reserve area!\u201dNot speaking about the last two area, just the six area in the front was also too much already. The amount of work that would be needed was too enormous and the Thunder-Yang Tree did not have that much amount of energy!During the moment when the Thunder-Yang Tree was planted, the Thunder-Yang Tree would view the mountain as its domain and release the first batch of energy to transform the domain. Afterward, the domain will refill the Thunder-Yang Tree with energy, and after the Thunder-Yang Tree absorbed enough energy, it will release the second batch of energy to transform the domain. This cycle will repeat again and in the end, the Thunder-Yang Tree and the domain will fuse together and become a treasure land.However, the chance to transform the domain was only three time!Liked it?

    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - Planning of the TerritoryPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euZhang Han has three chance to transform the domain however he wants. But after three times, whatever that he wants to do to the land, he would have to do it by hand.The power of transformation was not endless too. The Thunder-Yang Tree\u2019s energy was limited and Zhang Han needed to absorb a portion of the energy to rise to Qi Refining Realm. Just the energy that he needed was already more than half of the energy. Furthermore, the Yuanqing Tree that was going to be planted on the mountaintop also needed 20% of the energy so that its growth would be guaranteed.After counting all that, the remaining amount of energy was totally not able to support that many amount of areas.\u201cThis is a tough problem!\u201dZhang Han rubbed his head while feeling somewhat troubled. He had no choice but to give up on the idea of settling everything in one go.\u201cForget it. Food have to be eaten one mouthful at a time and the road have to be walked a step by a step. Besides, Meng Meng is still small and do not need to have an early rural lifestyle.\u201dWithout choice, Zhang Han placed the residential area, amusement area and viewing area on hold temporarily and the pet area that was at the back of the mountain on pending. The main priority was to first settle the planting area and poultry area.After finish planning, Zhang Han went on the web page and opened Xiangjiang\u2019s satellite map to view the size and position of different mountains.It must be said that, the number of mountains in Xiangjiang was numerous. However, as someone whose aim was to enjoy life, the leading choices were mountains which faced against the sea, because if one were to live on a mountain which faced against the sea, they would be able to view the scenery of the sea at any time that they want.After viewing for quite a while, Zhang Han discovered that most of the mountains had a very huge surface area. As a perfectionist, Zhang Han wanted to find a mountain which was extremely suitable for him. The mountain\u2019s surface had to be not too big, but at the same time, be big enough to accommodate the size of the areas that Zhang Han will be working on.After viewing for an hour, Zhang Han ultimately wrote down 7 addresses on the paper.Mountains which faced against the sea and had a moderate size. Those were the first batch of options.\u201cHope that I will be able to find a treasure land within one of those mountains!\u201dZhang Han lightly muttered to himself. Feeling somewhat exhausted, he decided to go and rest.Right after standing up, his phone rang.It is already so late? Who is the calling the phone?Zhang Han took out the phone from his pocket and upon seeing the dialer, he couldn\u2019t help going into a short daze.Zi Yan?After connecting through the phone call, Zi Yan\u2019s ferocious voice transmitted out from the phone,\u201cWhere are you?!\u201d\u201cI am currently at a hotel.\u201dZhang Han calmly replied.It appears that this seems to be the first time I have truly communicated with Zi Yan?To speak the truth, Zhang Han was currently feeling somewhat complicated. Towards Zi Yan, he wasn\u2019t able to treat her indifferently like other people.\u201cPerhaps\u2026it is because she is Meng Meng\u2019s mother I guess.\u201dZhang Han lightly muttered in his heart.Towards Zi Yan, it is best that I just follow my true heart and not be deliberate or artificial. Just follow my heart will do.\u201cHotel?\u201dZi Yan wrinkled her brows, then immediately relaxed afterward.Seems like this rigid minded guy cares a lot about Emily. If not, he would also not give up on that messy house of his and go stay at a hotel instead.\u201cWhich hotel are you at?\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s voice calmed down.\u201cFushi Hotel.\u201d Zhang Han shortly replied.Seeing that Zhang Han seems to not have any interest in speaking with her, Zi Yan couldn\u2019t help but feel angry in her heart.It is already not bad that I patiently talked with you, and yet you speak so coldly to me? What is the meaning of this?Thus, she said snappishly, \u201cSend the location to my wechat!\u201dAfter finish speaking, Zi Yan rolled her eyes, then hang up the phone.\u201cWhat is the matter with this woman?\u201dZhang Han curled his lips while feeling somewhat puzzled. He just reached Xiangjiang and Zi Yan was about to come over?How did she know that I came to Xiangjiang?Oh, that\u2019s right, she must have heard the airport\u2019s announcement when she was talking with Meng Meng on the phone just now.After opening up his phone\u2019s wechat, he immediately sent his location over to Zi Yan.\u201cRing, ring, ring\u2026\u2026\u201dTwo seconds later, the phone rang once again and Zhang Han answered the call.\u201cZhang Han!\u201dZi Yan\u2019s angry voice transmitted out from the phone.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Zhang Han got shocked.As expected of a singer. Even a phone was not able to obstruct Zi Yan\u2019s rather powerful voice.\u201cYou are at Xiangjiang?! Why didn\u2019t you tell me?! Why did you bring Emily to Xiangjiang on your own initiative? You caused me to rush over to Shangjing! You have no good intentions!\u201d Zi Yan said in succession.This matter simply angered her to the point that her teeth could itch. Originally, she was already very tired after being busy at the company for a whole day. Furthermore, during night time, she was not resting and was actually instead rushing over to Shangjing. But upon reaching Zhang Han\u2019s house, no one was there!\u201cYou also didn\u2019t ask?\u201d Zhang Han said with an innocent tone.\u201cJust because I didn\u2019t ask, you can\u2019t tell me?\u201d Zi Yan was feeling angrier now as she grinds her teeth and said, \u201cYou\u2026you wait and see!\u201dAfter finish speaking, the phone was immediately hang up by her.\u201cBad temper.\u201dZhang Han also did not mind it at all. Taking a stretch and feeling the exhaustion in his body, he walked towards the bedroom, preparing to sleep while hugging his daughter. While walking towards the bedroom, he mumbled to himself,\u201cIt\u2019s most likely that her great aunt came I guess.\u201d (??? \u2013 Great Aunt: Slang for menstruation.)At the other side, below the apartment that Zhang Han lived at in Shangjing.\u201cYawn\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhou Fei took a yawn, \u201cBig sister, he went to Xiangjiang already so what do we do? Book plane tickets to go back to Xiangjiang now?\u201dTowards things that concerned her daughter, Zi Yan had always been very decisive. Although it was already very late, Zhou Fei knows that Zi Yan would not mind rushing back to Xiangjiang for Meng Meng.\u201cForget it, let\u2019s find a hotel to rest first. We will go back tomorrow.\u201d Zi Yan shook her head.On the road towards the hotel, Zi Yan was somewhat absent-minded.He is willing to leave Shangjing?Towards Zhang Han, the father of her child, Zi Yan had also pay attention to him in these past few years. Naturally, she has some friends who were at Shangjing. After asking about for a bit, she understood the circumstances of Zhang Han this wretched young master. Towards Zhang Han\u2019s obstinate and not willing to leave Shangjing, she was also naturally aware of it.Perhaps it is because of his daughter.For him to choose to go Xiangjiang\u2026could it be because of me?Thinking up to here, Zi Yan\u2019s emotion indescribably became slightly frenetic.\u2026\u2026The following morning, while Zhang Han was enjoying his sleep, Meng Meng\u2019s crying sound once again woke up Zhang Han from his sleep.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Meng Meng?\u201dZhang Han swayed his head as he carried the little princess and said gently, \u201cDid you have a nightmare again?\u201dMeng Meng did not answer and only kept on crying.After messing around for a while, then did Zhang Han knew what the problem was.It turns out that, the little fellow wetted the bed and her disposable diaper was nearly fully drenched.\u201cDaddy help you change your pants. Don\u2019t cry okay?\u201d Zhang Han frantically helped the little fellow change her clothes.Afterward, Zhang Han made a cup of milk for the little princess and only after she started drinking it, then did her crying gradually stopped. Seeing that the little princess was somewhat embarrassed and bashful, Zhang Han immediately knew what the matter was.While finding it funny, Zhang Han said, \u201cMeng Meng, you are not even 4 years old yet. Wetting bed below the age of 5 is very normal.\u201d\u201cOh~\u201d Meng Meng twisted her little body.\u201cHaha\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhang Han smiled while patting onto the little princess\u2019s head, \u201cDaddy will bring you out to play today. We will go to\u2026Disneyland.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Meng Meng went into a daze for a while, then placed down her baby bottle and happily clapped her hands, \u201cAlright, alright! Go Disneyland play!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go and wake aunt up.\u201d Zhang Han carried Meng Meng and walked to the secondary bedroom.Under Zhang Han\u2019s guts training guidance, Meng Meng shouted out with her sweet voice,\u201cAu\u2026aunt, the sun is already shining on your butt and you are still sleeping! So embarrassing! If you still don\u2019t wake up, we will go and play on our own.\u201dUnder the little princess\u2019s shouting, Zhang Li also woke up. Taking a look at the clock and seeing that it was only 8 am, she sighed vexingly.After finish tidying up, Zhang Li opened the door and walked out. Seeing Zhang Han and Meng Meng playing around on the sofa, she rolled her eyes at Zhang Han petulantly,\u201cBrother, it is only 8 am you know.\u201d\u201cWhat you mean \u2018only\u2019? It is 8 am already and you are still sleeping. Quickly go and wash up. We are going to Disneyland later on.\u201d Zhang Han hurried.\u201cOkay, okay, okay. I will hurry up.\u201d Zhang Li curled her lips.After Zhang Li finish washing up and just when they were about to leave, she saw that the little princess wore too little and shook her head, \u201cThis won\u2019t do. Brother, you have to bring a jacket for Meng Meng.\u201d\u201cBring a jacket for what?\u201d Zhang Han asked while feeling puzzled.The temperature in Xiangjiang was quite high. Even though it was currently the autumn in the tenth month, walking on the road would still cause one to sweat.\u201cAren\u2019t we going to Disneyland? The temperature at Disneyland is very low indoor and quite high outdoor. What will you do if Meng Meng catches a cold because of the large change in temperature? Brother, you are also a father now, you have to take note of this kind of general knowledge.\u201d Zhang Li said.\u201cOh, you are right.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head, then went back to the bedroom and took a jacket with a cartoon on it for Meng Meng.It must be said that, women are always much more attentive compared to men.After having a simple breakfast at the hotel\u2019s restaurant, Zhang Han brought his daughter to Disneyland to begin their first trip at a theme park together.Zhang Han had not come to Xiangjiang\u2019s Disneyland before, thus Zhang Li assumed the position of being the host, or to say it simply, bitter work.At the Disneyland\u2019s entrance, Zhang Han carried the little princess and stood at a shady place while Zhang Li queued up to buy tickets under the sun.Disneyland was after all a first rate theme park in all over the world. Although there was no Ferris wheel that ordinary theme park would have here, the playability here towards children was much higher. Each and every fairy tale themed area received the fondness of many children.However, Meng Meng was after all only 3 years old and her height was not even a meter tall, thus there were many things that she wasn\u2019t able to play.\u201cWah\u2026there are so many people! Daddy, look at that balloon, it is so big! Daddy, look at there, look at there\u2026\u2026\u201dMeng Meng happily giggled continuously while her big eyes kept on looking all around everywhere.Entering into Disneyland, the first stop was Main Street, U.S.A, which was actually a shopping a street where on the left and right side of the street, there were stores that sold souvenir. Zhang Han did not intend to waste time here and thus straight away asked Zhang Li to help him take a few photos of him and Meng Meng.After finish taking the photos, they immediately came to the second stop, Frontierland.\u201cDaddy.\u201d With a grievance look, Meng Meng pointed to the rapid roller coaster and asked pitifully, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I play?\u201d\u201cBecause Meng Meng is still small. Wait after you grow up to 1.1m tall, you would be able to play.\u201d Zhang Li smiled and pinched Meng Meng\u2019s face.Since that Rapid Roller Coaster couldn\u2019t be played, they had no choice but to go to the Geyser Gulch. After taking a few pictures at the Geyser Gulch, they came to the Mystic Manor.\u201cDaddy, I\u2019m scared\u2026\u2026\u201dMeng Meng squeezed into Zhang Han\u2019s embrace, while secretly looking at the surroundings with her big eyes.The making of the Mystic Manor was excellent and the effects there were very good. The somewhat cold atmosphere made the little princess felt slightly afraid.\u201cLet\u2019s go to another place to play then.\u201dZhang Han said with a smile, then carried the little princess to the Garden of Wonders. Garden of Wonders was also considered as a place for taking photos. After walking one round at the Garden Of Wonders, it felt somewhat boring already.\u201cIt is about to reach 12pm. Let\u2019s go to Adventureland. At exactly 12pm, there will be the lion king\u2019s celebration performance.\u201d\u201cSet\u2026off!\u201d The little princess raised her hands.After reaching Adventureland, there was still about 5 minutes before 12pm. Carrying Meng Meng, Zhang Han sat in the third role near the corridor.Looking at the adorable characters within fairy tales, Meng Meng excitedly brandished her hands while within Zhang Han\u2019s embrace.The performance was all in English. For Zhang Han who was a beginner in speaking English, he could only barely make out some of the simple words.Contrary to Zhang Han, Meng Meng was born in North America, was able to understand English perfectly fine.Liked it?

    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 - Play DisneyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euThe lion king which was on the stage ran towards the audience while continuously brandishing his body. When the lion king reached in front of Meng Meng, the actor within the lion king costume deepened his voice and said,\u201cChildren, are you afraid that I eat you?!\u201d\u201cEh\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing that everyone\u2019s gaze all moved towards her, Meng Meng shyly hid into Zhang Han\u2019s embrace, and said shyly,\u201cI\u2019m not afraid, because I have Daddy.\u201dUpon seeing that, the lion king deepened his voice and said,\u201cRoar, roar, roar! I will eat you along with your father then!\u201cNo!\u201d Meng Meng hugged Zhang Han, displaying out a position of her protecting her father.Upon seeing that, Zhang Han slightly smiled, then lowered his head to the side of Meng Meng\u2019s ear and said a few words.Meng Meng was very obedient. Lifting up her head and blinking with her clear big eyes, she looked at the lion king and said in a cute voice,\u201cHumph! You\u2026you this insect also dare to try to scare me? Do you believe that my daddy will send you flying away with a slap!\u201dUpon seeing that, all the audiences could not help but start laughing. They were all melted away by Meng Meng\u2019s adorable appearance.All the audiences also thought that Meng Meng was just joking about what she said, but little did they know, this was all Zhang Han\u2019s unique Zhang Family\u2019s education.\u201cHahaha, what a truly adorable little princess.\u201dThe lion king said a sentence, then went to the front of other children to start continuing his performance.The half an hour performance ended amidst the sounds of cheers and laughter. After playing for 3 hours, Zhang Han was afraid that Meng Meng was somewhat tired and thus brought her to a restaurant to eat and rest.At afternoon 2pm, under Zhang Li\u2019s lead, Zhang Han brought Meng Meng to Toy Story Land.The first amusement item was Toy Soldier Parachute Drop, where Meng Meng who was slightly afraid of height felt somewhat afraid. After leaving the Toy Soldier Parachute Drop, they came to Slinky Dog Spin. At Slinky Dog Spin, Meng Meng felt that it was not as fun as the other amusement items, and thus the group went to the next area, Fantasyland.Meng Meng felt that Fantasyland was very fun, especially the Dumbo the Flying Elephant which made Meng Meng raised her hands and cheered happily.Seeing Meng Meng\u2019s adorable little look, Zhang Han smiled pleasingly.If it was placed in the past, it was reckoned that the shy Meng Meng would not do this kind of action. But right now, after going through Zhang Family\u2019s education, Meng Meng\u2019s guts had become slightly bigger.It was reckoned that, don\u2019t need too long, Zhang Han would be able to teach out a daughter that he would be satisfied with.After playing finish at the Fantasyland, it was already nearly afternoon 4pm. Under Zhang Li\u2019s lead, their journey in Disneyland was very strategically planned out.The next stop was Tomorrowland. After finish playing at Tomorrowland, they went back to Main Street U.S.A. The sky was beginning to become dark and thus the lights in Disneyland were opened in succession. After all the lights were turned on, the Disneyland was completely different from the Disneyland during the day. It was a completely different kind of scenery.After strolling for a while and finish buying some souvenirs, Zhang Li brought the father and daughter to Sleeping Beauty Castle. The Sleeping Beauty Castle was the best place to watch the Disneyland\u2019s fireworks.After finish watching the fantasy-like fireworks, a day of playing had also came to an end.Returning back to the hotel, Zhang Han first coaxed the little princess who was exhausted to sleep, then came to the living room.Zhang Li had already finished packing up her clothes,\u201cBrother, I\u2019m going to work now.\u201d Zhang Li looked at Zhang Han\u2019s expression and said cautiously.\u201cHmm, go then.\u201d Zhang Han casually waved his hand.This made Zhang Li felt somewhat unexpected.She knew her brother\u2019s temper was somewhat obstinate. Bar DJ this kind of job was surely a job that he did not approve of her working. Zhang Li was previously still very afraid of Zhang Han obstinately giving her some lectures.\u201cHowever\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s sudden speaking caused Zhang Li to become nervous again, as she heard Zhang Han said, \u201cWorking at that kind of place, you have to be a bit more careful. You are also not ugly. If someone were to harass you, you can just straightforwardly kick his crotch. Whatever problem that arises, your brother I will block it all for you.\u201dWhat would have been very warm and comforting was all ruined by that \u2018you are also not ugly\u2019!Zhang Li glared with her eyes opened wide, \u201cZhang Han! What do you mean by I am also not ugly?! You! What do you mean by that! I am the bar trumped card beauty DJ you know!\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Zhang Went slightly went into a daze, then smiled, \u201cFine, fine, fine. You are the most beautiful.\u201d\u201cHumph! No taste!\u201d Zhang Li rolled her eyes. Just when she was about to leave, she remembered something and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Brother, you are not like back in the past already. You cannot keep on spending money away extravagantly anymore. This hotel is too expensive already, just one night alone costs 180k rmb. Don\u2019t you have a house at Xiangjiang? Back then you even spent 2million rmb to renovate it. It should be much better compared to this hotel right?\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head, \u201cThat house have not been taken care of for a few years. I have to first call a cleaner to tidy up the house first.\u201d\u201cAs long as you understand. I will go to work first then.\u201d After finish speaking, Zhang Li hurriedly left.While leaving, the corner of Zhang Li\u2019s mouth hang up a smile.Seeing that Zhang Han was able to pull himself together, as his own sister, she was naturally very happy about it.Sitting on the sofa, Zhang Han casually opened the television to watch.The television was currently broadcasting the movie \u20182012\u2019.This was an epic grade disaster movie. In his previous life, Zhang Han had watched it for not less than 5 times. However, when he saw the unfamiliar male lead in the television, he was dazed.Wasn\u2019t the male lead supposed to be John Cusack? Why is it another person?Zhang Han went into a daze for a while, then stood up and walked to the computer table and began searching for John Cusack\u2019s information.However, after searching for a while, he wasn\u2019t able to find any information that belongs to John Cusack.There is no information of John Cusack?Zhang Han frowned as his fingers started typing rapidly on the keyboard, continuously searching for information about the entertainment industry.Gradually, the astonishment in Zhang Han\u2019s gaze became much more astonished.He discovered that, not only John Cusack was gone, even some other familiar superstars were also gone.Not only Hollywood superstars, even some China superstars in his past life also did not exist anymore.Also, there were some movies and television shows that were not filmed. Even though that, within the large entertainment industry, those movies and television shows were pretty much nothing, but those information all explained one thing.The development trajectory of the world in this lifetime has changed!\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s gaze revealed out pondering, \u201cIn the previous life, the children\u2019s mother, Zi Yan also did not appear. But in this life, she appeared, and I even have a daughter. I should have thought of this sooner.\u201dPerhaps the development trajectory of this lifetime changed because of my rebirth? After all, I am Han Yan Immortal Monarch. When a monarch arrives at Earth, causing a bit of effect to the Earth was natural!After finish pondering about the matter, Zhang Han smiled and shook his head.\u201cWhether if some people exist or do not exist in this lifetime, it also does not have anything to do with me. Right now, my main task is to be a good father.\u201dGood father?To Meng Meng, he was indeed a good father. But\u2026if his Zhang Family\u2019s education was to be known by others, it was reckoned that there would be a dispute whether if he was a good father or not.There was nothing wrong with doting your daughter, but where would people teach their own daughter to say \u2018you insect\u2019? This Zhang Family\u2019s education was indeed a huge problem in the eyes of other people, but since Zhang Han did not think that there was any problem, it was all ultimately useless even if others think that there was a problem.\u201cKnock, knock, knock\u2026\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the sound of door knocking rang out.It was already reaching 9pm. Who would be knocking the door at this timing? Could it be\u2026special service?Zhang Han went to open the door.When he opened the door, he was stunned as he discovered that the person that stood out the door was a tall beautiful woman that wore a sunglasses.The beautiful woman had an alluring body. She wore a Fendi down dress. The white as jade soft fur of the dress was clean and unique. On her feet, she wore a pair of crystal high-heeled shoes. The straight white legs of the beautiful woman were much more attracting than her clothes.On her left hand, she wore a silver Cartier wrist watch, and on her right hand, she held a Hermes Constance black alligator skin gold buttoned female shoulder bag.The woman\u2019s outfit and style were very fitting. With a look, Zhang Han this former rich second generation was able to make out the value of the entire items that was on the woman.Fendi westen-style dress 100k, shoes 50k, wrist watch 150k, alligator handbag 400k, and adding together all the other jewelries, it was more or less 1million rmb.Eh\u2026just how much are those alluring legs worth though?Zhang Han\u2019s gaze sized up and down at the beautiful woman\u2019s legs.\u201cHave you finish looking?\u201dA distinct cold voice suddenly rang out.The person who knocked the door was naturally not any special service, and was instead Meng Meng\u2019s mother, Zi Yan.Hearing that, Zhang Han curled his lips and looked at the legs for a bit more, then raised his head up and said,\u201cWhy did you come?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Zi Yan slightly went into a daze.Seeing her look, she was just like an enlarged version of when Meng Meng went into a daze. When this kind of expression and tone appeared on this iceberg beauty, it immediately made her seemed endearing adorable.However, at the next moment, the aura on Zi Yan\u2019s body immediately became cold.\u201cYou ask why I came?\u201d Zi Yan said with a rather big grievance, \u201cI came to pick up my daughter!\u201dAfter finish speaking, Zi Yan walked past Zhang Han and entered into the hotel room. Looking around, she asked, \u201cWhere is Emily?\u201dHearing that, Zhang Han slightly frowned as he closed the door and said, \u201cFirstly, she is not called Emily, she is called Zhang Yumeng, and her pet name is Meng Meng. Secondly, she is currently asleep, so be a bit softer when you talk.\u201dOriginally, Zi Yan already had grievance when she went to Shangjing and found out that Zhang Han and Meng Meng were not there. Right now, after hearing Zhang Han\u2019s tone, she immediately became angrier. Taking off her sunglasses, she glared at Zhang Han ferociously, \u201cYou say change name so change name? Based on what should I listen to you?\u201cBased on that I am the child\u2019s father. My surname is Zhang, so she must also be surnamed Zhang!\u201dIt was still fine not bringing up this matter, but when this matter was brought up, Zhang Han felt indignant. From the past up to now, where was there such a thing as a person\u2019s own child not having the same surname as the person?Hearing that, the anger within Zi Yan\u2019s heart became much bigger. Walking to the front of Zhang Han, she said stiffly, \u201cI am the child\u2019s mother. I carried her in my womb for 10 months and gave birth to her. It was I who raised her up till now. It was already very good of me to let you meet with her. What rights do you have to change her name without my permission? Why did you not inform me advance that you were coming to Xiangjiang? Do you still have in me in your eyes? Yet now you this convenient father who did not even take care of me or her for a single day still have a temper?\u201dThe facts tell us that, never ever quarrel with a woman.The series of words caused the corner of Zhang Han\u2019s mouth to twitch endlessly. Also, he couldn\u2019t help but sighed in his heart. Everything that Zi Yan said was the truth.Since the hard won\u2019t do, the soft should do right?Zhang Han\u2019s voice became feeble as he said,\u201cSit down and have a rest first. I will go and pour a cup of water for you.\u201d\u201cHumph! This sounds more like something a human would say!\u201d Zi Yan petulantly rolled her eyes at Zhang Han as she gracefully walked with her high-heeled shoes and sat on the sofa.After pouring a cup of water for Zi Yan, Zhang Han sat at the opposite and attentively took a few looks at Zi Yan.So it seems that, Meng Meng\u2019s delicate face, beautiful eyebrows, exquisite nose, lustrous big eyes and that lips which were thin like willow leaf were practically all inherited from Zi Yan\u2019s superior gene.Liked it?

    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 - The child\u2019s mother attacked \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euOf course, the yellow skin, black eyes and black hair of Meng Meng\u2019 were all inherited from Zhang Han\u2019s superior gene\u2026Eh\u2026Alright, speaking the truth, the only things similar between Zhang Han and Meng Meng were only the eyebrows and earlobe. This was even found out by Zhang Han after he had observed Meng Meng for quite a while.Looking at Zi Yan, her earlobe was much thinner, whereas Zhang Han\u2019s and Meng Meng\u2019s earlobe were more round.Also, aside from having a delicate face, Zi Yan\u2019s figure was also very curvy, possessing an S shape devil figure.The places that \u2018protrude\u2019 out were plump and round. Comparing Zi Yan now back to when she just started her career, her body was much plumper and rounder now. Right now, there was as if a kind of magic in Zi Yan\u2019s body, being able to keep on attracting Zhang Han\u2019s gaze, and even so much as to be able to give Zhang Han a kind of wanting to swallow his saliva kind of feeling.This woman, after becoming a mother, her figure had become much better and also much appealing. The attraction strength that the body has towards Zhang Han was truly not small.While Zhang Han was sizing Zi Yan up and down, Zi Yan was also sizing Zhang Han up and down.Seeing the trace of perverted look on Zhang Han\u2019s face, Zi Yan felt somewhat proud in her heart.Rigid brain, to dare to not want to speak with me and act aloof. Yet right now, you true character has appeared. Humph!However, Zhang Han\u2019s neat and tidy dressing also made Zi Yan felt somewhat surprised. The previous time when she met with Zhang Han at his apartment, the sloppy look of his made Zi Yan to not even have the mood to speak with him. But right now, the appearance was still the same as 5 years ago, just that, the dissolute and elegant that he had back then had disappeared. Right now, there was more of a maturity and steadiness, and also the feeling of casualness.With Zi Yan\u2019s taste, she liked the Zhang Han right now much more, and not that Zhang Han 5 years ago who was crude and rough!\u201cHumph, who likes him!\u201dZi Yan lightly snorted in her heart.The two people stared at each other with their eyes, one staring with her big eyes and the other staring with his small eyes. While staring at each other, both of them did not say anything, causing the atmosphere to become slightly awkward.\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything that you want to say?\u201d Zi Yan said as she blinked her big clear eyes. Within her words, there was the intention of reminding Zhang Han.It would have been alright if Zhang Han had said something pleasant. But right now, he was not even speaking at all.I rushed from Xiangjiang to Shangjing during the night and rushed back from Shangjing to Xiangjiang the next day. The reason as to why I had to rush about was all because of Zhang Han, and yet he actually doesn\u2019t say a word of apology at all!\u201cSay what?\u201d Zhang Han opened his mouth and replied.In a moment, Zi Yan became much angrier and also felt very disappointed towards Zhang Han in her heart.She immediately stood up and said angrily, \u201cForget it, I also have nothing to speak to you, I will go and pick Emily now!\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d Hearing that, Zhang Han quickly stood up and walked to the front of Zi Yan in a few steps.Originally, with Zhang Han\u2019s temper, he would have straightforwardly said, \u201cMeng Meng is my daughter, she will be following with me from now on!\u201dBut when the words reached his mouth, Zhang Han was not able to say it out. Without a doubt, he was not a fool. He knew that if he were to say those words, the woman in front of him would instantly turn into a tigress!Thus, Zhang Han used a discussing tone,\u201cEh\u2026Didn\u2019t you say that you are letting Meng Meng stay with me for a week time? Today is only the fifth day.\u201d\u201cMeng Meng is mine. I can do whatever I want and don\u2019t need you to care.\u201d Zi Yan declared her sovereignty. While speaking, Zi Yan suddenly realizes her mistake, \u201cSpit, spit, spit. I mean Emily.\u201dAfter finish speaking, she did not pay any more attention to Zhang Han. Opening the bedroom\u2019s door, she walked into the bedroom.\u201cMommy?\u201d Hearing the sound of people speaking, Meng Meng muddle-headedly opened her eyes. Seeing that her mother was in front of her, the little princess was incomparably happy.To not have seen each other for 5 days, Zi Yan also missed the little princess very much. Sitting at the bedside, she gently hugged Meng Meng into her embrace.The expression on Zi Yan\u2019s face right now was very warm. Emitting out the radiance of maternal love, her voice was also 100 times gentler compared to when she spoke with Zhang Han, \u201cMy baby, did you miss mommy?\u201d\u201cMiss, miss, miss\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng said happily as she pouted her little mouth and kissed Zi Yan\u2019s face.Zhang Han looked at the cosmetics on Zi Yan\u2019s face and wanted to remind, \u201cDon\u2019t kiss already, you are kissing a mouth of foundation!\u201dBut when the words reached his mouth, he was not able to say out the words again. It was most probably that he did not bear to interrupt this warm moment between Zi Yan and Meng Meng.Right now, Meng Meng also did not completely belonged to him. She has her own mother, and the mother was about to bring her away.Sigh\u2026\u2026Zhang Han sighed lightly. His heart was somewhat reluctant to part with Meng Meng.\u201cMommy is here to pick you up. Aunt Fei Fei is still waiting downstairs for us. Let\u2019s go back home after wearing your clothes okay?\u201d Zi Yan said with a smile.\u201cAlright! Go home!\u201d Meng Meng raised her hands happily.Meng Meng missed those hairy toys of hers that were at home very much.However, after Meng Meng finished wearing her clothes and Zi Yan held her with her right hand and pulled the suitcase with her left hand and walked towards the door, Meng Meng then finally reacted,\u201cMommy, wait for a while, Daddy still haven\u2019t finish wearing his clothes.\u201d\u201cYour daddy he\u2026still has some things to do. That\u2019s why mommy is here to pick you up.\u201d Zi Yan thought for a while and said.When Zhang Han who was at the side heard that, his lips wiggled and wanted to say, \u201cI am free! Let Meng Meng continue staying here!\u201dHowever, the reality wasn\u2019t like this. Even if Zi Yan didn\u2019t say anything, Zhang Han also indeed had things that he needed to do.Hearing that her father was not going home with her, Meng Meng\u2019s clear big eyes began tearing up within a second.\u201cBoohoo\u2026\u2026No\u2026\u2026I want daddy\u2026\u2026together\u2026\u2026\u201dMeng Meng wiggled around in her mother\u2019s embrace and began crying, as she stretched her little arms towards her father, requesting her father to hug her.Zhang Han\u2019s heart slightly trembled and he hurriedly went forward and brought Meng Meng into his embrace and starting consoling her.Father consoling his own daughter. This should have been a very warm scene, but Zi Yan, on the other hand, felt somewhat upset.It has only been 5 days and she is already so intimate with her father! If the time gets longer, will I still be able to bring her away?Zi Yan felt that this was a dangerous signal. She could not allow anyone to snatch away her daughter from her! Thus, she glared at Zhang Han with a threatening gaze.Zhang Han shook his head helplessly and consoled, \u201cMengMeng, daddy really have things to do. Daddy has to go find a domain during the next few days, so that I can build a utopia for Meng Meng. Like that, in the future, Meng Meng would be able to be together with daddy\u2026\u2026and also mommy forever.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course. Daddy would never ever bluff you.\u201d Zhang Han said with a slight smile.\u201cThen\u2026\u2026then what are there in utopia? Is there any adorable dolls?\u201d Meng Meng stopped crying. However, the tears were still hanging at the corner of her eyes, making her seemed very pitiful.Zhang Han wiped away the tears in the corner of Meng Meng\u2019s eyes and said with a smile, \u201cNot only are there dolls, there is also a very big house, adorable doggies, beautiful cats and also many many other pets that you can play with. Also, there will be a lot of delicious food and a lot of fun places there.\u201d\u201cWah! Doggies and cats! Meng Meng like it!\u201d Meng Meng said longingly.\u201cAs long as you like it. Therefore, daddy really has things to do. After daddy finishes with things, I will come and pick up Meng Meng okay\u2026\u2026\u201dLooking at Zhang Han coax Meng Meng to stop crying with just a few sentences, while letting out a breath of relief, she also lightly snorted in heart,\u201cGraceful words and flowery speech! This Zhang Han really knows how to bluff children!\u201dHowever, this was still the first time that Zi Yan had seen such a tender side of Zhang Han. From Zhang Han\u2019s smile, she could not see any resemblance to that stiff and rigid minded Zhang Han who she quarreled with a few days ago.\u201cAlright, Emily, say goodbye to your daddy. We have to go already.\u201d Zi Yan once again carried the little princess in her embrace.\u201cGoodbye, daddy.\u201d The little princess waved her hand. Even after the coaxing, the little princess was still somewhat reluctant to part with her daddy.\u201cLet me send you all.\u201dZhang Han silently picked up the slightly heavy suitcase.Walking out of the door and seeing the sulky Meng Meng, Zhang Han smiled and patted on her head,\u201cMeng Meng, next time you have to call me daddy, not the third tone, but the fourth tone.\u201d\u201cDaddy?\u201d Meng Meng\u2019s age was still small and thus her pronunciation was not clear. Furthermore, she grew up in North America. Her English was fluent but for her Chinese, she had only just begun learning it only and thus was still not that good with the pronunciation.\u201cIncorrect.\u201d Zhang Han said with a weird face, \u201cThe daddy that you are speaking of is dung, which means poop. Do daddy look like poop?\u201d(In Chinese, Meng Meng calls Zhang Han as \u2018\u7c91\u7c91\u2019. \u2018\u7c91\u7c91\u2019 has quite a few meaning to it, one of them is poop and the other is father. The actual word for father should be \u2018\u7238\u7238\u2019 though. The pinyin for both \u2018\u7c91\u7c91\u2019 and \u2018\u7238\u7238\u2019 are \u2018ba ba\u2019, but just different tone or something. Hope this explanation is understandable.)Facing against Zhang Han\u2019s weird face, the little princess giggled continuously.\u201cI feel that you do look like poop.\u201d Zi Yan agreed deeply with the comparison and said with a teasing tone, \u201cBaby, next time you can just call him \u2018daddy\u2019. No, no, call him smelly daddy.\u201d\u201cHehehe\u2026\u2026smelly daddy, smelly smelly daddy\u2026\u2026\u201dAmidst laughter, the few of them reached downstairs.When it was time to leave, the little fellow was still reluctantly as she asked pitifully,\u201cMommy, when will I be able to see daddy again?\u201d\u201cAfter he finishes with the things he has to do.\u201d Zi Yan casually answered.\u201cThen, when will you finish with your things daddy?\u201d Meng Meng asked.Hearing the question, Zhang Han wanted to say, \u201cDaddy is not busy.\u201dBut in the end, he said, \u201cDaddy will be very fast. After I finish with my things, I will immediately go and pick you up. So, you must stay at home obediently until then.\u201d\u201cMeng Meng will be very very obedient!\u201dAfter Meng Meng and Zi Yan got into the car and Meng Meng stood by the car\u2019s window at the back, Zhang Han couldn\u2019t help but remind,\u201cMeng Meng! You have to remember the name that daddy got for you okay.\u201dZhang Han\u2019s reminder caused the rolling of Zi Yan\u2019s eyes.\u201cI understand\u2026\u201d Meng Meng replied.The car started up and gradually drove far away. Zhang Han stood still and looked at the car drove further and further away blankly. Only until the car disappeared from his field of vision, then did he let out a light sigh and went back to the hotel.\u201cOh? That fellow gave Emily a new name?\u201d While driving the car, Zhou Fei snorted lightly.Back then when she accompanied Zi Yan to meet with Zhang Han, the incident where Zhang Han and Zi Yan quarreled caused her to deem Zhang Han as a scumbag.Furthermore, he was deemed as a wretched, big temper and small capability kind of scumbag!\u201cHe is very obstinate about it. When he heard of Emily\u2019s name, he was even not happy, saying that because his surname is Zhang, Emily also have to be surnamed Zhang.\u201d Zi Yan said petulantly.Back then when she gave birth to the little princess and was thinking of a name for the little princess, she subconsciously only gave the little princess a pet name, Emily. In her heart, she had perhaps also fantasize about building a family with the children and the children\u2019s father. But after coming into contact with Zhang Han, she was incomparably disappointed and that trace of fantasy in her heart also disappeared.\u201cThat fellow also think too much already.\u201d Zhou Fei said with a disdain tone.\u201cHumph!\u201d Hearing that, Meng Meng was not happy about that and said loudly, \u201cSmelly Aunt Fei Fei! You cannot speak badly of daddy!\u201dThis scene made Zi Yan felt somewhat astonished.The Meng Meng in the past would never speak so loudly! What was the matter right now?Zhou Fei\u2019s face froze and said helplessly,\u201cAlright, I will not say badly of your daddy okay? Emily, why are you not gentle anymore after staying with him for a few days?\u201d\u201cI, I am not called Emily.\u201d Meng Meng said.\u201cThen what are you called?\u201d Zhou Fei asked with a smile.\u201cI am called\u2026Zhang Yumeng\u2026\u2026Meng Meng\u2026Meng Meng Meng Meng!\u201d The little princess adorably raised up her hands and said.\u201cAh! That rough and rigid minded fellow is actually able to think of such a feminine name?\u201d Zhou Fei smiled lightly and shook her head.Liked it?

    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - Mount New MoonPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euZhang Han went back to the hotel and sat alone on the sofa.Meng Meng\u2019s depart made him felt like he had lost something, giving him a feeling of uneasiness.Actually, this did not mean that Zhang Han\u2019s character was delicate or anything. If someone was in the same position as Zhang Han, learning the knowledge of cultivation and all sorts of treasures for 500 years in the Cultivation World, it was reckoned that the person would also be extremely lonely just like Zhang Han.After rebirth and meeting with this adorable daughter of his, the void within Zhang Han\u2019s heart was immediately completely filled. Furthermore, his parents were still alive and he had the chance to make up for his regret. When all of those things combined, it caused Zhang Han\u2019s mental state to become much gentler.Of course, the person who contributed the most to causing his mental state to become much gentler was the adorable little princess, Meng Meng.\u201cI should go and investigate those 7 mountains I guess.\u201dZhang Han shook his head, then opened up the computer and entered into Baidu map to check the location of the mountains. (Baidu is the Chinese version of Google.)The first mountain was a short mountain at Moxie Range, which was at the west of Xiangjiang, and the rest of the mountains were at southeast side. The second mountain starts from the east side of Xiangjiang, which was the Xiongya Mountain, and the rest of the mountains were all between Xiongya Mountain and the Cresent Mountain which was at the south.There were only 7 mountains which faced against the ocean and had a suitable surface area that Zhang Han needed.The Causeway Bay which Zhang Han was currently at was at the north of Xiangjiang. Thus, he intends to first go to Moxie Range which was at the west, then afterward go east and head to Xiongya Mountain, and from Xiongya Mountain, begin to head south.After finish planning the route for the next day, Zhang Han also began to perfect the plan for the domain.When the Thunder-Yang Tree was planted, it would erupt out the energy which Zhang Han would need for cultivating and transforming the domain. The energy erupted out would be able to allow Zhang Han to rise to the weakest realm, Qi Refining Realm.Qi Refining Realm was more or less the same with \u2018internal strength\u2019 which most people were familiar with. Also, it could also be called as qi. Both internal strength and qi were able to use by people to increase their speed, strength and so on. When Zhang Han reached Qi Refining Realm, he would be able to barely be able to use his Treasure Smelling Nose.Although Qi Refining Realm was the weakest realm, but do not belittle this Qi Refining Realm. Qi Refining Realm was the beginning of cultivation to immortality. Although only by reaching to the Xiantian Realm would one then truly become a true cultivator, which almighty beings did not start their journey from the Qi Refining Realm?A night without words.Next morning, 8am, after Zhang Han quickly finished his breakfast, he checked out from the hotel.The cost of staying at the hotel for two days was 360k rmb. After the receptionist verified that there was no problem with the room, she gave back Zhang Han 140k rmb. Adding up with the expense during the past two days, there was currently still 1.6million rmb in Zhang Han\u2019s bank card.Carrying a simple luggage, Zhang Han set out on his journey. He did not chose to take the subway and also did not chose to extravagantly buy a car, but instead very realistically went to a car rental company in the vicinity and spent 28k rmb to rent a blue-purple jeep. The rental of the jeep was for a month.Driving the jeep, Zhang Han used half an hour to reach his first destination, Mo Xie Range.After walking for about 20 minutes, Zhang Han reached the peak of the short mountain at Mo Xie Range. Looking at the surroundings and walking path around the mountain, he nodded his head,\u201cNot bad. Just not sure if this place will be able to give me a surprise or not.\u201dZhang Han raised his right hand and took out the Thunder-Yang Tree from his ear.After taking a deep breath, Zhang Han pricked the Thunder-Yang Tree which seemed just like a white jade needle into his vein.In the past, Zhang Han had refined this Thunder-Yang Tree before. Although right now he had no cultivation at all, there was still a very faint thread of connection between him and the Thunder-Yang Tree.Right now, Zhang Han was using his blood to stimulate the Thunder-Yang Tree, making it transfer its energy to him so that he would be able to use his Treasure Smelling Nose.The moment the Thunder-Yang Tree pricked into his vessel, Zhang Han felt his blood flowing and at the same time, he also felt the faint threads of spiritual strength.\u201cTreasure Smelling Nose, open!\u201dZhang Han closed his eyes, and the image of the mountain below his feet appeared within his mind. Exhaling out a deep breath, the faint threads of spiritual strength continuously converged to his nose.At the next moment, Zhang Han lightly sniffed,\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201dAt the same time when he sniffed, there was a change in the image of the mountain within Zhang Han\u2019s mind. From the flowers to the grasses, trees, soil, and rocks, threads of faint light continuously converged together, and in the end, got sniffed into Zhang Han\u2019s nose.The fragrance of the grasses and flowers, the astringent of the trees, and also the unique smell of the rocks and soil.Different smells all converged together. But within the smell, the unique smell of a treasure was not there!\u201cThis is not a treasure land.\u201dPlucking out the Thunder-Yang Tree, Zhang Han placed it back into his ear and lightly shook his head.Silently walking back to the jeep, he started driving to the second destination, Xiongya Mountain.Half an hour later, after Zhang Han lost a bit of his blood, he stood at the mountaintop and shook his head,\u201cNot a treasure land.\u201dDriving towards the south, he investigated mountain after mountain. The results that Zhang Han received made him felt disappointed but at the same time, the results were also within his expectation.\u201cNot a treasure land too. I expected too much already. How could a treasure land be found that easily?\u201dZhang Han\u2019s complexion was slightly pale. This was the sign of losing too much blood.Entering into the jeep, Zhang Han headed towards the last location \u2013 Crescent Mountain.\u201cHope this Crescent Mountain will not disappoint me.\u201dZhang Han lightly shook his head.Crescent Mountain was situated on the east side of Crescent Gulf.Crescent Gulf was Xiangjiang\u2019s famous tourist attraction. Leaning against a mountain and facing against the sea, the gulf had the shape of a crescent and was thus called Crescent Gulf. Crescent Gulf also had the nickname of \u2018Number 1 gulf under the heaven\u2019, and the reputation of being the Hawaii of the East. It was the gulf of Xiangjiang which had the most representativeness.The scenery at the Crescent Mountain which Crescent Gulf leaned against in the east was very pleasant. Standing at the top of Crescent Mountain, the entire view of Crescent Gulf could be seen.This location was the best location within the 7 mountains.\u201cPretty good.\u201dStanding at the mountaintop of Crescent Mountain and looking at the scenery of Crescent Gulf, Zhang Han exclaimed.His house was located at Bamboo District which was on the west side of Crescent Gulf. If it was to be said by the locals of Xiangjiang, Zhang Han\u2019s house which was 115 square meter big was already counted as a mansion already.In Xiangjiang, a house that was more than a 1000 foot was counted as a mansion. This was because the house price in Xiangjiang was extremely high. Once before, the house price in Xiangjiang broke the record and became the highest priced house in the world and became famous throughout the world.1000 foot was equivalent to 93 square meters and Zhang Han\u2019s house was 115 square meters big. 7 years ago, he spent 15million rmb to buy the house. Adding up with the renovation and furniture which cost 3million rmb, he spent a total of 18million for the house.Furthermore, Zhang Han was not really satisfied with the result of the house. Compared to Bamboo District, Crescent Gulf was the place which he wanted to stay at.However, the house price at Crescent Gulf was somewhat too much even for the Zhang Han back then, who was one of the four young masters in Shangjing.Land was extremely expensive. Only this sentence was able to describe the houses in Crescent Gulf.Especially the mansions that were at Crescent Gulf, where a mansion could easily go for more than 1billion rmb and above. Even the much more ordinary houses in Crescent Gulf were also absurdly expensive. Therefore, the Zhang Han back then gave up on the idea of wanting to buy a house in Crescent Gulf.\u201cIf this Crescent Mountain is okay, it would also count as fulfilling a small regret of mine I guess.\u201dZhang Han shook his head and once again took out the Thunder-Yang Tree from his ear. Pricking the Thunder-Yang Tree into his vessel, his blood began to be absorbed by the Thunder-Yang Tree. Deepening the connection with the Thunder-Yang Tree, the Thunder-Yang Tree once again release out a bit of energy to Zhang Han.\u201cTreasure Smelling Nose, open!\u201dZhang Han closed his eyes and lightly sniffed.Various kind of smell rushed towards his nose.Suddenly, an extremely strong and pure fragrant entered into his nose. The smell was just like a hundred-year-old excellent wine.\u201cThe heaven did not turn its back on me! It is actually a pond of spiritual water! Hahaha\u2026\u2026\u201dZhang Han looked towards the sky and started laughing out loud. While he was laughing, his eyes suddenly rolled as he happily fainted due to excess blood loss.\u201cWoof, woof\u2026\u2026\u201dNot sure how long passed, Zhang Han suddenly felt a dog barking beside him, and after the dog barked out two times, it bit onto shoulder part of his clothe and dragged him backward.Hmmm?Zhang Han muddle-headedly opened his eyes.Right now, he had the symptoms of someone who had excess blood loss. His complexion and lips were very pale, there was cold sweat on his skin, his hands and legs were cold and lacking in strength, his breathing was slightly rapid and his pulse was quick and weak.Sitting up his body with great effort, he immediately saw that at his side, there was indeed a dog.This was a four-eyed dog which was filthy from top to bottom. This dog was also called as Chinese rural dog and commonly referred as \u2018native dog\u2019.Taking a look at his surroundings, Zhang Han discovered that his current position was 20meters away from the position where he fainted at. Seems like it was this dog who saw Zhang Han fainted and wanted to drag him down the mountain.\u201cSeems like a kind-hearted dog.\u201dZhang Han lightly laughed. Looking at the somewhat vigilant native dog who did not dare to come forward, he stretched out his palm towards the dog.Receiving the friendly signal, the dog then slowly walked towards Zhang Han. Zhang Han also did not mind that the dog was filthy and patted the dog on its head. This caused the dog to wag its tail happily.At this moment, Zhang Han then discovered that the dog\u2019s right leg which was at the back was broken.Seems like it was a dog that was abandoned.The dog walked two rounds around Zhang Han. Seeing that Zhang Han was fine, the dog turned around and left.Zhang Han silently sat still for a few minutes before leaving the mountain. Entering into the jeep, Zhang Han squinted his eyes and looked at the Crescent Mountain. While looking, a trace of smile could not help but hang up on the corner of his mouth.Spiritual water. As the name implies, it was similar with spiritual soil, spiritual grass and so on. It was something which could be used for cultivating.Within the middle part of Crescent Mountain, there was a cave there, and within the case, there was a pond of spiritual water.Although it was the most ordinary kind of spiritual water, and there was also not much spiritual water, but under the nourishment of Thunder-Yang Tree, the spiritual water would be able to turn into Pure-Yang Water.The use of Pure-Yang Water was much bigger compared to spiritual water. It could nourish the Thunder-Yang Tree and start a beneficial cycle for both the Thunder-Yang Tree and itself.If it was said that the Thunder-Yang Tree was able to nourish the domain, then it could be said that the Pure-Yang Water was able to nourish living creature. Speaking from the capability alone, Pure-Yang Water was better, but speaking from the essence, Thunder-Yang Tree was still much higher ranked compared to Pure-Yang Water.There were countless amount of treasures in the Cultivation World, and some of those treasures belonged to the classification of spiritual treasure too. Spiritaul treasure can go from rank 1 all to way up to rank 9. The higher the rank, the better the spiritual trasure. Thunder-Yang Tree was a rank 5 spiritual treasure and Pure-Yang Water was only rank 1. What was the rank of spiritual water then? Spiritual water was not even counted as a spiritual treasure.Spiritual treasure was an all-inclusive general term. All kinds of flower, grass, tree, wood, pill, and weapon and so on could all be counted as spiritual treasure!Back when Hanyang Immortal Monarch shook the Cultivation World, this rank 5 spiritual treasure, Thunder-Yang Tree, was nothing to him at all. But right now, it was a necessary item for Zhang Han to step into the entrance of cultivation to immortality!Although Zhang Han found a treasure land, he did not intend to immediately occupy the mountain and deem himself as the king of the mountain.Right now, he was not Hanyang Immortal Monarch anymore. The current him was not even able to block against the bullets of this profane world. Therefore, he had to follow the rule and go back home first and research more about the Crescent Mountain before he decides what to do.However, before all that, Zhang Han intends to go back to the \u2018mansion\u2019 which he had never stayed in for 7 years.The \u2018mansion\u2019 was situated at Bamboo District\u2019s neighbourhood, Milan Neighbourhood.Zhang Han straightforwardly drove to the property management area. Towards Zhang Han\u2019s arrival, the property management personnel felt somewhat unexpected, but they were still very passionate.Although many of the property management personnel here have already been changed countless times, all of the personnel naturally knew the information of the property owners here. Therefore, they also naturally knew Zhang Han this special property owner. Back then when Zhang Han brought the house, he straightforwardly paid 10 years of property fee. This kind of thing was rarely seen.\u201cMr Zhang.\u201d The management personnel passed the house key to Zhang Han\u2019s house and said with a smile, \u201cEvery half a month, our property management would send a cleaner to your house to clean the house. Since right now you have returned, we will return the key to you. If there is any matter, you can contact us anytime.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Zhang Han slightly went itno a daze. He did not expect that the service would be that good. After nodding his head in response, he left the property management area.Liked it?

    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 - Zi Yan\u2019s DilemmaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euLooking at the house which has been cleaned very cleanly, Zhang Han nodded his head with satisfaction.The layout of the house was 3 bedroom and 1 living room. The house faced towards the north and south. Within the house, there was a big living room and an open kitchen.No matter was it the living room, bathroom, or bedroom, they were all renovated extremely luxuriously. With the German imported marble floor, extremely exquisite roof, modern-styled kitchen and so on, even after 7 years have passed, the renovation was still up to one\u2019s expectation.After taking a look around the house, Zhang Han felt that his body was somewhat exhausted. Right now, he was an ordinary human being. The effect of excess blood loss was still quite big on him. However, after planting the Thunder-Yang Tree and taking in the energy and rising to Qi Refining Realm, his body would be able to completely recover.Lying down on the sofa, he casually opened the television. After watching the television for less than 2 minutes, he dizzily fell asleep on the sofa.\u2026\u2026Imperial Entertainment Company, within the office of Artist Director Mei Qi.\u201cBig Sister Mei.\u201dZi Yan lightly knocked on the door and walked into the office. After taking a look at Young Master Li, Li Cheng, she nodded her head towards Mei Qi and said,\u201cI have finish considering. I decided to first release an album.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Mei Qi leaned her back onto the office chair. Her expression did not have the enthusiasm she had during a few years ago. With an indifferent tone, she said, \u201cIt is good that you can think like this. After all, you have not appeared in the entertainment industry for 5 years already. Who knows how the fans of yours back then feel about you right now. Let\u2019s release an album first and test the water then.\u201d\u201cBig Sister Mei, didn\u2019t you told me last week that there are 10 premium songs within the company\u2019s music library? Can you let me choose 4 songs from it? During the afternoon, I intend to\u2026\u2026\u201d Zi Yan got right to the point and said.\u201cThat was last week!\u201d Before Zi Yan finished speaking, Mei Qi straightforwardly waved her hand and interrupted, \u201cXiao Yan, you also know that there are not enough resources within the company to share with all the artists. Right now, within the 10 premium songs, 8 songs had already been taken. I can give you the remaining 2 songs, but the album needs to have at least 10 songs and above. Therefore, for the other 8 songs, you will have to choose them from the ordinary songs in the music library.\u201dAfter finish hearing what Mei Qi said, Zi Yan slightly went into a daze and felt somewhat disappointed within her heart.During the 5 years where she was working in the entertainment industry, it could be said that Zi Yan was groomed to the peak of the entertainment industry solely by Mei Qi. The relationship between the two of them was also not bad, and Mei Qi cared for her a lot. Every time when the company received premium songs, Mei Qi would always let Zi Yan choose first, and even more, Mei Qi would pay visits to famous composers to specially request songs for Zi Yan.But right now when Zi Yan had returned to the company, not only did Mei Qi barely showed any interest, she even strictly scolded Zhou Fei who came quite to find her a few times to request for resources. Mei Qi had seemed to change into a completely new person.However, Zi Yan did not blame Mei Qi because back then when she left the company, Mei Qi was also somewhat affected by it.However, Zi Yan couldn\u2019t help but feel somewhat disappointed in her heart.Just when she was about to open her mouth and accept Mei Qi\u2019s proposal, Li Cheng who was at the side opened his mouth first,\u201cMei Qi, Zi Yan is after all your gold artist back in the past. How can you go back on what you promised her? Just let Zi Yan choose 4 songs from the 10 premium songs.\u201dAfter Li Cheng finished speaking, Mei Qi\u2019s expression froze and revealed out a troubled expression.Zi Yan also took a look at Li Cheng.This Young Master Li was a typical second-generation rich. His father was, Li Hai, was one of the members of Imperial Entertainment Company\u2019s Board of Directors, holding a high position in the company. Therefore, although Li Cheng did not hold any position within the company, he still has somewhat of a position within the company.Li Cheng had a height of 1.8m. His figure was well shaped and his handsome outer appearance allowed him to be like a fish in water when picking up girls. His appearance was very fitting with many women\u2019s taste. However, his private life was very dissipated. It was even rumored that there were quite a few artists within the company who had an ambiguous relationship with him before.Just this point alone was something that Zi Yan could not accept. Also, not speaking about all of those, Zi Yan also has a daughter right now and also even have an unclear relationship with Zhang Han. Before she finished settling her relationship with Zhang Han, she did not intend to find her other half yet.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was troubled and hesitation within Mei Qi\u2019s face, but in the end, it all turned into a helpless tone, \u201cSince Young Master Li has spoken, I will of course not refuse. Zi Yan, you have to properly thank Young Master Li. I heard that you did not attend the appointment to have dinner with Young Master Li yesterday.\u201dZi Yan\u2019s expression did not changed. Her cold face made others not able to guess what she was thinking about. After Zi Yan finish listening to everything, she stood up and slightly nodded at Li Cheng,\u201cThanks Young Master Li for the good intention. However, I do not want to spoil the company\u2019s rules. I will follow according to what Big Sister Mei previously said. I will go pick the songs first then.\u201dAfter finish speaking, Zi Yan walked out of the office with her high-heeled shoes. She did not want to accept Li Cheng\u2019s help. Although accepting Li Cheng\u2019s help would help her rise in the entertainment industry, she disdained doing that.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u2026\u201dLi Cheng laughed faintly. Looking at Zi Yan who was walking at the corridor through the window, a pondering smile raised within his gaze.\u201cHumph! Unable to tell what is good from bad!\u201d Mei Qi frowned and snorted, \u201cShe still really thinks that she was still in the same position as she was back then? How could a has-been celebrity be able to shine again that easily?\u201d\u201cSay, I actually likes this temper of hers. The more aloof she is, the more I want to conquer her!\u201d Li Cheng slightly shook his head.\u201cHow about I let her taste some hardships first? People like her have to see through the reality first before they would become well-behaved.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Li Cheng nodded his head.\u201cI will not give her even a single song from within the 10 premium songs. I will just casually find 2 songs from the music library and say that those 2 songs are premium songs. As for the rest of the songs, I will just let her find on her own.\u201d Mei Qi sneered.Originally, all 10 premium songs were still not taken yet. The words that Mei Qi previously said to Zi Yan were all Li Cheng\u2019s indications. Li Cheng\u2019s motives? Well, there was no need to explain his obvious motives.On her journey back to her own office, there was not a single person who greeted her. Even more, she even heard a few soft comments that said \u2018has-been celebrity\u2019. However, Zi Yan did not pay any attention to it. Her cold face was just like a defensive shield which would not allow anyone to see her exhaustion and helplessness.\u201cBig Sister Yan, how did it go? Did Mei Qi give you any premium songs?\u201d After Zi Yan walked into the office, Zhou Fei immediately stood up and asked.\u201cShe only gave me 2 premium songs.\u201d Zi Yan slightly shook her head.\u201c2?\u201d Zhou Fei frown and said somewhat angrily, \u201cHow can you release an album with only 2 premium songs? You have to at least have 4 premium songs! I reckon that that old witch is doing it on purpose.\u201d\u201cFei Fei, don\u2019t anyhow say. There were only 2 songs left within the 10 premium songs.\u201d After sitting on the sofa, Zi Yan lightly sighed.\u201cHow is that possible? Why haven\u2019t I heard of anyone who gotten the premium songs? I reckon that she just doesn\u2019t want to give it to us!\u201d Zhou Fei said.\u201cDon\u2019t say anymore already. Let\u2019s go downstairs and have lunch first. During the afternoon, we will go pick out the songs for the album.\u201d Zi Yan stood up and said.Zhou Fei angrily followed Zi Yan to the restaurant downstairs. After having a simple lunch, they hurriedly went back upstairs.They came to the department for choosing songs. Within the department, there was 2 small private room for listening to song. Within each room, there was a computer and a high sound quality speaker.Upon reaching the hallway, the door of the first private room opened and 3 people walked out from the room. The person who was in the lead had a tall and slender figure, and wore a very revealing v-neck dress.Upon seeing Zi Yan, a trace of complacent flashed on her face as she said eccentrically,\u201cOh? Isn\u2019t this the big celebrity, Zi Yan? Didn\u2019t you already change profession and went to the movies and television world? Why did you still come here to pick songs?\u201d\u201cXu Ruoyu, whatever that we do doesn\u2019t seem to concern you right? Why are you everywhere that we go?\u201d Zhou Fei retaliated snappishly.Xu Ruoyu was the new third-rate singer which the company had started grooming not too long ago. She has a bit of popularity and a very big pride. Also, her relationship with that Li Cheng was quite ambiguous.\u201cWell, it is true that it doesn\u2019t concern us.\u201d A woman who was at Xu Ruoyu\u2019s side sneered, \u201cHowever\u2026It seems that the popularity of a certain someone is beyond terrible to the point that even the company doesn\u2019t want waste any energy on grooming the person. Within the 10 premium songs that the company has this time, Big Sister Mei had actually given 8 of the songs to Ruoyu. As for the remaining 2 songs, you two can go ahead and listen attentively. I reckoned that those 2 songs would be the best choice that you two would be able to have.\u201d\u201cHaha, people who are ugly does indeed need to use a high quantity of premium songs to make up for it.\u201d Zhou Fei said ruthlessly.\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d Xu Ruoyu glared with her eyes opened wide.\u201cFei Fei, let\u2019s go.\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s expression remained cold from start to finish. After taking a slight look at Xu Ruoyu, she walked past them and walked towards one of the private room.\u201cHumph!\u201d Xu Ruoyu lightly snorted and said without turning her head, \u201cZi Yan, let me give you a reminder. Today is the 1st of September and my album will be released on the 15th. It is best that you avoid releasing your album during that period of time. If not, with you standard, I\u2019m afraid you will fall into the bottom of a pit.\u201dHearing that, Zi Yan\u2019s footsteps came to a stop as she turned her head around and said coldly, \u201cOh, thanks for your reminder then.\u201dAfter finish speaking, she went into the private room with Zhou Fei.\u201cJust what kind of person is that? Seeing her act like that just makes me feel disgusting!\u201d Zhou Fei said angrily.Although Zi Yan was expressionless, but her tone also became somewhat heavier, \u201cLet\u2019s pick the songs first.\u201dOpening the computer and entering into the company\u2019s music library, Zi Yan immediately saw the 2 premium music that Mei Qi left for her.Clicking open the first music, both Zi Yan and Zhou Fei entered into their working mode and began attentively listening to the song.\u201cBang!\u201dAfter finish listening to the song, Zhou Fei couldn\u2019t help but slammed onto the table and said angrily, \u201cThis kind of song can also be counted as premium?! That old witch must definitely be trying to make things difficult for us! Since when has the company\u2019s premium songs deteriorate to this kind of degree?\u201dAt this time, Zi Yan did not say anything and silently acknowledged with what Zhou Fei said. Lightly sighed, Zi Yan opened the second song.However, the second song was also not up to one\u2019s expectation. Those 2 songs were only a bit better than the worse songs within the music library. If those 2 songs had to be compared to premium songs, it had to be said that those 2 songs did not even have half the quality of a premium song.This result caused Zhou Fei to be angry to the point that she gnashed on her teeth. After finish venting away her anger, Zhou Fei then began listening to the songs in the music library one by one with Zi Yan.From the moment they started listening to the songs, they listened from afternoon 1pm to 7pm, which was a total of 6 hours. After listening to more than a hundred songs, they out picked out 5 somewhat decent songs. Of course, the general that was picked out within a bunch of dwarves was still but after all a dwarve.\u201cLet\u2019s go back home.\u201d Zi Yan said after taking a look at the time.I can still accompany Meng Meng if I go back now. If I were to go back a bit later, the little fellow would most likely have fallen asleep.\u201cHow are we going to choose those lousy songs\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhou Fei mumbled with a worried look on her face. Standing up and after finish packing up their things, they left the company.On the way back home, Zi Yan who was sitting at the back of the car suddenly said,\u201cFei Fei, we will have to work a bit harder in those next few days. We will also release our album on the 15th!\u201d\u201cBig Sister Yan, you want to\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhou Fei slightly went into a daze.Zi Yan did not reply and looked out of the window.Xu Ruoyu, you are intending to release you album on the 15th right? You like to provoke me with mocks and ridicules right?Alright!I will also release my album on the 15th then!Zi Yan was not a saint. Facing against Xu Ruoyu\u2019s provocation, she would of course also feel angry. Just that, she wouldn\u2019t show the softness in her heart on her face only.For people to live, they have to breathe, for a tree to live, it has to have its bark. Zi Yan wants to prove herself by using her own strength!(\u4eba\u6d3b\u4e00\u53e3\u6c14\uff0c\u6811\u6d3b\u4e00\u5f20\u76ae \u2013 For people to live, they have to breathe, for tress to live, they have to have their bark. In Chinese, the bark is the \u201c\u76ae \u201c, and the breathe is the \u201c\u6c14\u201d. The \u201c\u6c14\u201d, aka breathe, refers to \u201d\u9aa8\u6c14\u201d, which means \u2018backbone\u2019. The \u201c\u76ae\u201d aka bark, refers to \u201c\u8138\u76ae\u201d, which means \u2018face\u2019. Basically, what this sentence means is that one must live with a backbone. Another explanation is that, people live for their face.)Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The total surface area of the first and second floor was about 400+ square meter, which also meant that each floor was about 200+ square big.Back when Zi Yan bought the house, the house price of the houses in this area was 150k rmb per square. For the house, renovation, and furniture, Zi Yan spent a total of close to 70million rmb. No matter where this house was placed at in China, this house would still be counted as a grand residence.Zi Yan had a lot of money back then, but after retiring, the money that she spent in the 5 years after she retired was not a small amount. Up to today, she also only had around 10million rmb left in her bank savings.Perhaps if that amount of money was given to some other ordinary people, it would be enough for them to spend an entire lifetime. However, in Zi Yan\u2019s view, that amount of money was far from enough to spend.She wants to give Meng Meng an extremely good life. Which was also one of the reasons she came back out of retirement.Of course, the biggest reason that she came back out of retirement was still because of her celebrity dream. She had still yet to fulfill her dream and did not want to give up on the dream.Returning back to the home.\u201cMeng Meng, did you had fun playing with Aunt Wang?\u201d Zi Yan said with a smile.Upon seeing Meng Meng, the pressure in her heart immediately became much lighter. Only when she was with Meng Meng, then would she unload the coldness on her face and hang up a gentle and sweet smile.Aunt Wang was a professional nanny which Zi Yan hired over with a high salary. Aunt Wang name was Wang Juan and she was in charge of looking after Meng Meng and tidying up the house.\u201cQuite\u2026quite a bit, but not as fun as when I was playing with daddy. I miss daddy already.\u201d Meng Meng pouted her little mouth and said.\u201cYou will be able to see your father after he finished with his things.\u201dZi Yan said petulantly.The little fellow is already somewhat dependent on her father after only staying with him for 5 days. If she is to stay longer with her father, just how dependent will she be on her father?Right now, Zi Yan was already thinking to herself that she must not let Meng Meng and Zhang Han get in touch with each other too frequently.Control. Correct, I must control the amount of time that they meet with each other.At this side, ZI Yan was happily playing with the little fellow, while at another side, Zhang Han who was lying on the sofa was muddle-headedly opening his eyes.\u201cHmm\u2026\u2026It is already 8pm?\u201dZhang Han sat his body up. He had slept all the way from afternoon to night-time 8pm. But even after having slept for such a long time, he still felt very exhausted.\u201cGrumble, grumble\u2026\u2026\u201dZhang Han\u2019s stomach grumbled, reminding Zhang Han that he should go eat dinner right now.Zhang Han went to a restaurant nearby and straightforwardly ordered some blood enriching food.Black chicken soup, pig liver with stir-fried spinach, and a big cup of brown sugar water that was specially requested.The black chicken soup was very fresh. But with Zhang Han\u2019s somewhat fussiness, after he ate a few mouthfuls of the chicken meat, he immediately knew that the black chicken was not an authentic free-range chicken.Free-range chickens were also known as stupid chickens, which were chickens that were domestically raised without feeding those fodder that hurried their growth. Although the size of those chickens, ducks, and gooses that were fed with fodder that hurried their growth was much bigger, the nutrition they should have possessed were not that abundant, and even more, within their body, they had some chemical substances which were harmful to the human body.But for the case of free-range chickens, that was not the case. To speak from every aspect, free-range chickens were much better compared to those fodder fed chickens, especially on the aspect of taste, where free-range chickens were much more fragrant and tender.Another thing was that the chickens that were normally bought from supermarkets, when stewed in a pot for an hour, they were easy to become overcooked. While on the other hand, when free-range chickens were stewed in a pot for an hour, its meat would still be firm. Thus, speaking from the root, free-range chickens were much better compared to fodder fed chickens.As a result, the price of a free-range chicken would normally be above 100rmb, while the price of a fodder fed chicken would normally be around 20rmb. Additionally, those market that sold free-range chicken for around 50rmb to 70rmb each would normally always be fake goods.The black chicken that Zhang Han was currently eating was said to be a domestic raised free-range chicken on the menu. But when he was eating the black chicken, he could tell that the chicken wasn\u2019t actually a domestic raised free-range chicken.Honestly, Zhang Han didn\u2019t really mind about it. Wait after he planted the Thunder-Yang Tree, he could just raise some himself. But before that, he would have to just make do with his current situation.Because of excess blood loss, Zhang Han forcibly ate finish the entire black chicken. Not only that, he also drank finish the soup, and the entire cup of brown sugar water, and ate finish the entire plate of pork liver with stir-fried spinach. After finish eating and drinking everything, Zhang Han truly felt that his stomach was somewhat bloated.After eating finish, Zhang Han sat in the restaurant to rest for 10 minutes. After paying the bill, Zhang Han left the restaurant, then gave Zhang Li a call and proceeded to head towards her rented apartment.The rented apartment was 88 square meter and had 2 room and 1 living room. The decoration of the rented apartment was much more in the comforting aspect. Also, it could be seen that the apartment was taken care well by the two female.\u201cXiao Li, do you know of anyone in the Lands Department?\u201dWithin Zhang Li\u2019s bedroom, Zhang Han opened his mouth and asked.\u201cNope. Brother, why is your complexion somewhat pale? Are you sick?\u201d Zhang Li asked with concern.\u201cMost probably caught a cold while I was sleeping. Don\u2019t worry about it, it\u2019s nothing at all.\u201d Zhang Han smiled and shook his head.\u201cWhy did you ask if I knew anyone in the Lands Department?\u201d Zhang Li asked curiously.\u201cI want to\u2026\u2026rent a mountain.\u201d\u201cPfff\u2026\u2026\u201d In a moment, Zhang Li almost got choked by her saliva. Opening her eyes up wide, she said while feeling inconceivable, \u201cI didn\u2019t hear wrong right brother? What do you want to rent a mountain for?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss about nothing.\u201d Zhang Han lightly tapped onto Zhang Li\u2019s forehead and said, \u201cI want to rent a mountain to plant some things.\u201d\u201cThere is no need to rent a mountain just for planting things right? In Xiangjiang, this place, do you think you can rent a mountain just because you want to rent it? What\u2019s more, even if the mountain can be rented, the price of renting the mountain would also definitely be absurdly high. Brother, you are really being too rush already.\u201d Zhang Li said with a tone of hating iron for not becoming steel.(\u6068\u94c1\u4e0d\u6210\u94a2 \u2013 Hating iron for not becoming steel: To be disappointed at someone for not being able to meet their expectations.)\u201cYou will understand when the time comes. About the mountain, I have to rent it for sure. So, do you have anyone friend who works in the Lands Department?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who works in the Lands Department\u2026Wait! Let me go ask Li Anna.\u201d After finish speaking, Zhang li hurriedly ran out of the room.Li Anna was the other tenant of the rented apartment. She attended school at Xiangjiang University for 4 years. After she graduated, she worked as an office worker into a large company, and thus knew a lot of people.Li Anna was roughly around 1.6m tall. Her height was relatively short and her plump face gave her a trace of adorableness. Li Anna was fond of males that were tall. Upon seeing Zhang Han who was 1.8m tall, her eyes lighted up as she greeted,\u201cHello, Big Brother Zhang.\u201d\u201cHello.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head.\u201cI heard that Big Brother Zhang you wanted to rent a mountain? Which mountain did you have your eyes on?\u201d Li Anna asked with a smile.Although she was fond of males that were tall, it did not mean that she would fall in love just upon seeing a tall male. In this world, where would there be that many instances of love at first sight? Therefore, after finish the simple greeting, she started to ask about the main matter.\u201cCrescent Mountain.\u201d\u201cCrescent Mountain?\u201d Li Anna\u2019s complexion slightly changed. The answer that she got was somewhat out of her expectation. Her tone became somewhat serious, \u201cCrescent Mountain is not that simple. Even the officials of Xiangjiang are not sure if they are going to develop Crescent Mountain or not. After all, Crescent Mountain was right next to Crescent Gulf. Even if they wanted to develop Crescent Mountain, they still have to undergo land bidding. Forgive me for speaking bluntly, but if you want to rent the mountain by yourself, you are really thinking too much already.\u201d\u201cThen what about renting for short-term? Rent period of between 1 year above and 5 years below would do.\u201d Zhang Han frowned.Not speaking of other aspects of Crescent Mountain, just the spiritual water that was found within Crescent Mountain was enough for Zhang Han to not give up on Crescent Mountain.If it is really impossible, I will just occupy the mountain by force. How can the laws of the profane world be able to restrict me, the grand Hanyang Immortal Monarch?Of course, this kind of thoughts only flashed through his mind for a bit. Right now, he, Hanyang Immortal Monarch actually really have to be well-behaved.\u201cShort-term?\u201d Li Anna slightly went into a daze, \u201cIf you are looking to rent Crescent Mountain for a short-term, it is still possible. Let me call my friend and help you about it first.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head.Li Anna took out her phone and called her friend right in front of Zhang Han. It could be seen that she was indeed sincerely helping Zhang Han and that she was a person who had a warm heart.After finishing the call, Li Anna smiled and said,\u201cHe said that regarding this matter, you can call him at tomorrow morning 7am and meet up with him to talk about it. Seems like there is hope for renting Crescent Mountain. Big Brother Zhang, you take down his phone number first and just contact him tomorrow will do. His name is Liu Meng. His phone number is XXXXXXX.\u201d\u201cAlright, thanks. Have you eaten dinner Anna? Let me treat you to supper?\u201d Zhang Han said with a smile.Zhang Han\u2019s polite words and bright smile gave Li Anna a pretty good impression of Zhang Han. However, she still shook her head and said with a smile,\u201cI\u2019m not eating supper. Eating food at night is easy to become fat. Big Brother Zhang, you don\u2019t have to be that courteous, my relationship with Zhang Li is very close.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright, don\u2019t be that genteel. I have to go work already. Are you staying here brother?\u201d Zhang Li asked.\u201cI will be going back to Milan Neighbourhood.\u201dZhang Han stood up and said.At downstairs, after bidding farewell to his sister, Zhang Han drove that purple-blue jeep and went back to his house that was at Milan Neighbourhood.When passing by a supermarket, Zhang Han went into the supermarket and bought brown sugar and red dates. Back home, Zhang Han boiled a pot of brown sugar red date drink and drank 3 cups of it. Those were things that were able to enrich his blood.Sleeping early and after waking up at morning 7am, Zhang Han dialed Liu Meng\u2019s phone and straightforwardly explained the matter. Afterward, the two of them decided on meeting at a Starbucks near Milan Neighbourhood at 8am.\u201cHello, Mr Zhang.\u201d Liu Meng reached the Starbucks punctually. Upon seeing Zhang Han, he passionately stretched out his hand.\u201cHmm.\u201dZhang Han slightly nodded his head. After finish shaking hands, he sized up Liu Meng for a bit. Liu Meng wore a formal attire, had a thin build and tanned skin. From Liu Meng\u2019s actions and bearings, it could be seen that he was a slick person.\u201cI heard that Mr Zhang you wanted to rent Crescent Mountain?\u201d Liu Meng asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThere may be plans to develop Crescent Mountain in the few coming years. Do you have any consideration for renting other mountains?\u201d Liu Meng said with a smile.\u201cNope. I just want to ask whether if it is possible to rent Crescent Mountain or not.\u201d Zhang Han headed straight to the point and said.\u201cThen, I want to ask, what are you intending to rent the Crescent Mountain for?\u201d Liu Meng asked.\u201cTo plant some things.\u201d Zhang Han smiled faintly and said.\u201cThis matter is not that easy to deal with. However, since you are a friend of Anna, I can help you ask about it. But, even if it can be rented, there will also be a lot of restrictions, like for example that you can\u2019t cut down the trees or modify the mountain. I\u2019m not sure if you are able to accept this kind of condition?\u201d Liu Meng said.\u201cI can accept it.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head, then said, \u201cIf you have any other requests, you can feel free to say it now.\u201dThis sentence was what Liu Meng wanted to hear. After all, he also did not want to help Zhang Han for free. Therefore, upon hearing that, he became much more enthusiastic when discussing the matter of renting Crescent Moon. After discussing for quite a while and the time was about to reach 9am, Liu Meng stood up to bid farewell and said that he would give a definite answer to Zhang Han at night.During the afternoon, Zhang Han went to buy some high-quality beef, kelp, wood ear, and other food which were able to indirectly enrich his blood. After buying finish those food, he then went to a Chinese medicinal store to buy some Chinese medicine which were able to enrich his blood. Zhang Han intends to spend the entire day at home to nourish his body because, during the time when he plants the Thunder-Yang Tree, he would have to let the Thunder-Yang Tree absorb a lot of his blood.Therefore, within the next few days, he had to nourish his body. If not, when the times come and he actually dies due to losing too much blood, it would be the joke of the century.At another side, at Imperial Entertainment Company, Zi Yan and Zhou Fei were currently still in the private room listening to songs.Filtering songs by listening to one song after another was also a very tiring thing.But, the main reason for it being tiring was still also because the songs within the music library were all too ordinary already. What\u2019s more, it could even be said that most of the songs within the music library could be counted as rubbish.However, Zi Yan and Zhou Fei had no choice. All the songs that were available were all here.Thus, the two of them was only able to choose to use Zi Yan\u2019s excellent voice to raise the quality of those songs. This path would definitely be difficult, but Zi Yan was still willing to continue persisting forward.After using an entire day, they only finished choosing 30 songs that were decent. After they finish picking out 100 songs that were decent, they intend to pick out the somewhat better ones from within the 100 \u2018dwarves\u2019.Liked it?

    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 - The sensation of selling a housePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euThe time moved very quickly and it was already evening.At 5pm, Zhang Han received a call from Liu Meng.\u201cMr Zhang, I have some lead on the matter already.\u201d Liu Meng said with a smile.\u201cWhat is the situation?\u201d Zhang Han raised his brows. He felt somewhat unexpected that there was already a lead regarding the matter. Seems like, this Liu Meng actually has some doorways within the Lands Department.\u201cLet me speak about the conditions first, and you see if you can accept it or not. If you can accept it, I will tell you about the matter in detail.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cFirstly, you can only rent the mountain for 1-3 years time, and most likely during the third year, the mountain will be expropriated. When that time comes, you will have to unconditionally comply with everything concerning Crescent Mountain. Furthermore, there are also a lot of restrictions of what you can and can\u2019t do at Crescent Mountain even after you rent Crescent Mountain. I will not speak about those restrictions first. As for the cost of renting the mountain, originally for your situation, it would normally be at least 20million rmb per year. However, since you are a friend of Anna, I will give you face. You give me 2million rmb to bribe around the Lands Department, and I will be able to push down the rental fee of the mountain to 10million rmb per year.\u201d Liu Meng went straight to the point and said.\u201cCan, I have no issues.\u201d Zhang Han was also not draggy and straightforwardly agreed.\u201cAlright! Then let me tell you about the restrictions that will follow along with renting Crescent Mountain\u2026\u2026\u201d Liu Meng began his lengthy conversation.Zhang Han quietly listened to Liu Meng talk. For a whole 5 minute, Zhang Han listened to Liu Meng talk about the restrictions. Thus, it was obvious that there were a lot of restrictions.Simply explain the restrictions, it was that Zhang Han could not move around anything that was in Crescent Mountain. With the rental cost of 10million rmb per year, the most Zhang Han could do was plant some things in the mountain and also climb the mountain to go sightseeing.After all, this was just renting of the mountain and not bidding of the mountain. If it was bidding of the mountain, the amount of money that would be needed would be absurdly high. It has to be known that, the mansions that were at Crescent Gulf were priced at 10million rmb above each. So, for a place like Crescent Mountain where the land location was much better compared to Crescent Gulf, if any mansions were built at Crescent Mountain, the price of each of those mansions would be insanely high.For there to be so many restrictions even after renting the mountain, if it was changed to someone else, they would definitely not be able to agree with it. However, Zhang Han only lightly nodded his head and said,\u201cCan.\u201dAt the same time, a faint radiance flickered within Zhang Han\u2019s eyes.Not able to move anything? Restrictions? All of those were nonsense!Right now, it was also mainly because Zhang Han did not have any strength. If he was in the Xiantian Realm, he would not have the need to care about that much stuff and just immediately occupy the mountain with force!However, as for now, he still has to be honest and well-behaved. Silently becoming rich was the true way of the king!With regards to silently becoming rich, Zhang Han had comprehended it to the greatest heights. Back then when he entered into the Cultivation World, he had searched for treasures for 500 years. Before he had reached to Tribulation Realm, no one knew just who Hanyang Immortal Monarch was. But when he reached the peak of Tribulation Realm, after only a few years passed, the name of Hanyang Immortal Monarch had resonated throughout the myriad worlds!Back to the topic. At the other side of the phone, hearing that Zhang Han was okay with it, Liu Meng became delighted and said,\u201cYou can just transfer the 2million rmb to my bank later on then. The contract can most likely be signed tomorrow.\u201dLiu Meng truly needed the 2million rmb to bribe around the department. However, after he finished bribing, he would still have 20% remaining to keep for himself.\u201cTomorrow is not possible, I still have things to do. How about this? Today is Monday, I will contact you again before Friday arrives.\u201d Zhang Han said.\u201cAlright then. I will wait for your news.\u201d Liu Meng slightly went into a daze and his tone also became somewhat disappointed. After finish talking and hanging up the phone, Liu Meng felt that Zhang Han was most likely not intending to rent the mountain already. After all, with those restrictions, it was no different from not renting the mountain.And as for Zhang Han, the reason he rejected to sign the contract tomorrow was that\u2026\u2026he had no money.Right now, he truly had no money. Currently, he only had 1.6million within his bank. This amount of money was far from enough.However, that was not a problem. Zhang Han had already thought of a plan.The plan was, sell his house!That was right, the only movable asset that Zhang Han had right now was his house.During the day, Zhang Han found out the house price of houses within Milan Neighbourhood and also took photos of his house.7 years ago, Zhang Han spent 15million to buy this house. Currently, 7 years later, the price of houses in China was all currently rising, especially the houses in large cities, where the house price was rising like crazy.However, the Bamboo District that Zhang Han was at was already very developed 7 years ago and price of houses here was also already extremely high 7years ago. Thus, the rise in the price of houses at Bamboo District was not that high and did not insanely rise multiple times like those houses in the new districts.Still, no matter what, this house that belonged to Zhang Han was still worth at least 20million currently. Adding on with the renovation and furniture that Zhang Han spent a total of 3million for, the total value of the house was at the least around 23million rmb.However, Zhang Han did not intend to sell his house at the original price. Just like when he was selling the Ferrari, he straightforwardly posted the complete photos of his house on a certain website for sale at 18million rmb and emphasized that 3million rmb worth of renovation and furniture was counted as free.People who worked in Xiangjiang all understood that, Xiangjiang was a heaven for the wealthy and a hell for the average worker.The living tempo speed of workers in Xiangjiang was extremely fast. They all had the awareness of \u2018if you don\u2019t work hard enough, others will have the chance to surpass you\u2019. Thus, everyone was all stressing themselves to \u2018work harder, and harder, and harder\u2019 when working.Therefore, when Zhang Han posted his house for sale, practically all of the real estate agent companies within Bamboo District all discovered this news immediately.\u201cManager! Manager! Quickly come, there is a big matter!\u201dPractically almost everyone said out those words at the first moment they discovered Zhang Han\u2019s post.And after all the managers also saw the post, they more or less also said the same words,\u201cQuickly, quickly, quickly! Quickly give the person a call!\u201dTherefore, within less than 2 minutes after Zhang Han posted his house for sale, a series of phone call followed upon.After picking up 10+ phone calls and understanding that all of them were coming over to take a look at the house in a while, Zhang Han felt that there more or less enough amount of people and thus rejected the incoming phone call. After turning his phone off, he also went to the site to remove his post.In a moment, the house became quiet once again. But little did Zhang Han knew, right after he turned off his phone, at Yunyin Garden, within Zi Yan\u2019s house,\u201cMeng Meng, your daddy\u2019s phone is turned off. We will give him a call tomorrow again okay?\u201d Zi Yan helplessly placed down her phone.Meng Meng was full of joy, as she blinked her clear big eyes and looked forward to talking with her daddy on the phone. But who knew that, in the end, a bucket of cold water was splashed onto her. In a moment, the little princess felt more grievance.\u201cSmelly daddy, does he not want to talk with Meng Meng? I don\u2019t like him already\u2026Smelly daddy\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng starting crying and throwing a tantrum.Originally, Zi Yan wanted to seize the opportunity to criticize Zhang Han, to make Meng Meng not be that dependant on him. But, upon seeing Meng Meng\u2019s pitiful look, Zi Yan actually instead helped speak good of Zhang Han,\u201cYour daddy is most likely still busy. Meng Meng, your daddy also definitely miss you too. Didn\u2019t he say that he is going to build a utopia for you? He is most likely busy with that matter. The next time you meet with your daddy, he will bring you to the utopia he built for you.\u201d\u201cRea\u2026really?\u201d Meng Meng stopped crying and was filled with anticipation towards the utopia that her daddy spoke of.\u201cReally.\u201d Zi Yan held back her laugh and said with a serious face.Humph! Rigid minded fellow! Bluff children more! Boast more! I want to see just how you are going to deal with the lie during the next time you meet with Meng Meng!Little did Zi Yan knew, Zhang Han was actually currently working towards the goal of building Meng Meng\u2019s utopia. The reason he was willing to sell the house at low price was also because he wanted to be able to quickly rent the mountain and build a utopia for Meng Meng. The earlier that he could settle down, the earlier he could be able to be able to be with her little daughter and properly undergo his special Zhang Family\u2019s education.As Hanyang Immortal Monarch\u2019s daughter, Meng Meng was destined to never be ordinary! Zhang Han\u2019s first small goal was to teach out the strongest little devil in this world!Right now, at Zhang Han\u2019s house, the first wave of people had arrived.Only 10 minutes had passed and they were already here. It must be said that the efficiency of the agent companies in this area was really fast.There were 3 people in the first wave. There were 1 male and 2 females. The male was the manager of an agent company, and the other 2 females were people who discovered Zhang Han\u2019s post and confirmed with Zhang Han to come view house.\u201cWah, it is really the same as in the photos.\u201dOne of the females who had a ponytail gasped with surprise.Although the 3million rmb renovation and furniture cost were not comparable to the truly wealthy people at Xiangjiang this place, it was still much better compared to the average family and belonged to the upper-class level.\u201cTruly not bad!\u201d After the manager finished viewing around the house, he nodded his head in satisfaction and said, \u201cMr Zhang, forgive me for speaking bluntly but, this house of yours is able to be sold for at least 22million rmb currently. Are you sure that you want to sell it at 18million rmb?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d Zhang Han lightly nodded his head and said with a calm face, \u201cI only want to sell the house away as fast as possible.\u201dUpon getting Zhang Han\u2019s confirmation, the manager\u2019s face became delighted,\u201cMr Zhang, can I have a look at your identity card and property proof?\u201d\u201cThey are all on the table, you can have a look.\u201d Zhang Han had already prepared the documents earlier on, as he pointed towards the table in the living room and said.The manager hurriedly went over to take a look at the documents. After confirming the documents, a smear of excitement appeared on his face,\u201cExcuse me for a while, I have to contact my superior.\u201dAs long as one was not a fool, they would be able to see the business opportunity of the house. If they were able to buy the house and resell it, they would be able to get a profit of more than 4milllion rmb!The manager even wanted to immediately buy the house by himself. But helplessly, he simply did not have 18million rmb at all.Not every manager was as lucky as that manager who bought the Ferrari from Zhang Han.While the manager walked into the sub-bedroom to call his superior, another wave of people had arrived.The people who arrived this time was 2 males. One of them was a 30+ years old middle age man, while the other was a male with the appearance of 20+ years old. When the two of them entered into the house and saw that someone else had arrived earlier than them, their face slightly changed as they hurriedly went up to greet Zhang Han.How were they able to know who Mr Zhang was?That was because, no matter male or female, all the people who worked at an agent company would wear a formal attire. That way, they would be able to give their client a kind of sense of security.And as for the first wave of people, upon seeing another bunch of people arriving, hostility flickered within their eyes. Those two people who just arrived were also \u2018top quality\u2019, as they relentlessly glared back at the first wave of people who arrived. In a moment, the house was overflowing with hostility.However, the main matter was what that was important. After finish glaring, the two males quickly hurried to Zhang Han\u2019s side to discuss the matter.Similarly with the previous manager, after confirming Zhang Han\u2019s documents, the two males immediately contacted their superior.Thus, in the following hour, Zhang Han was completely busy as he had to deal with the 10+ waves of people who arrived in succession.However, the inner quality of those people was pretty good. Before entering the house, they would first wear a brand new shoe cover. Thus, the house did not become dirty because of having too many people.80% of the managers all wanted to immediately seal the deal with Zhang Han, but Zhang Han did not gave them a definite answer and instead told them that he would deal with whoever who had the fastest transaction speed.Normally, the sequence of processes of a house transaction would take at least a month. However, the boss of some agent companies possessed wide connections and was able to very quickly settle the complicated sequence of processes, which was also what people \u2018so-called\u2019 to \u2018cut in line\u2019.All the way until nighttime 10pm then did Zhang Han opened his phone. But he did not expect that, within half an hour, he would receive 3 phone call.All of the contents of the 3 phone calls were practically the same, where they told Zhang Han that in the following afternoon, after he goes to the second-hand house transaction center and signed the papers, they can transfer him the money on the day. As for the other procedures, the agent company would settle it.Thus, Zhang Han told them that he would deal who whoever who arrived the earliest tomorrow. After all, he was not able to extinguish just who was who.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - Rent a restaurantPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euThe next day, early morning 3am, Zhang Han woke up from the sound of knockings on a door.\u201cWhat is going on?\u201dZhang Han muddle-headedly opened his eyes and slightly frowned. Getting up and opened the door, the person standing outside the door was one of the people from the first batch of people who came to view the house yesterday, Manager Ma.With dark circles under his eyes, Manager Ma said with an apologetic tone, \u201cMr Zhang, I am truly sorry for disturbing your rest. Can\u2026can I invite you to go sauna, and also have a chat together?\u201d\u201cNot going.\u201d Zhang Han still did not have enough sleep and was intending to close the door and go back to continue to sleep.A trace of anxiousness flashed across Manager Ma\u2019s face, \u201cMr Zhang, please give me a chance, I have stayed outside your house for a whole night already. If you go back to sleep now, there will definitely still be other people coming here and bother you. So, why not you go to the sauna with me? I will guarantee that you will be able to have the best rest.\u201dHearing that, Zhang Han\u2019s brows raised.It was said that the early bird gets the worm. This Manager Ma was not only early, but super early.\u201cYou wait awhile for me.\u201dZhang Han stroke his face with his hand and said. Without even closing the door, Zhang Han immediately went back to his room to change his clothing. Upon seeing that, Manager Ma let out a sigh of relief.Five minutes later, together with Manager Ma, Zhang Han headed towards a high grade sauna in the vicinity.Right after they left and not even had 20 minutes passed, another manager knocked onto Zhang Han\u2019s house door. However, the manager after Manager Ma was destined to not be able to meet Zhang Han.At the sauna, Zhang Han slept all the way until morning 8am. After waking up, he was invited by Manager Ma to eat breakfast, followed by being brought to the head office. Arriving at the head office, Zhang Han then followed with a region manager to go to the transaction area to sign the contract.At noon 12pm, all of the procedures were handled, and within Zhang Han\u2019s bank card, there was also 18million rmb more in it.After getting the money, Zhang Han straightforwardly called Liu Meng\u2019s phone and asked for Liu Meng\u2019s bank account number, then transferred 2million rmb over to Liu Meng\u2019s bank account.After finishing with all those, it was already afternoon.(I checked online and it seems that, \u4e2d\u5348 \u2013 noon, is either 11am-1pm or 12pm-2pm. \u4e0a\u5348 \u2013 afternoon, is 1/2pm-5pm.)Right now, there was 17.6million rmb in Zhang Han\u2019s bank account. Subtracting out 10million rmb for the cost of renting the mountain, he was still left with 7.6million rmb.Although 7.6million rmb seems to be a lot, the amount things that could be done with it was not a lot.At 1 o\u2019clock, Zhang Han drove the jeep and drove a few rounds around the area at Crescent Mountain.Since there was already progress with renting the mountain, the next thing Zhang Han needed to do was to find a place to stay at temporarily.Although there was a pond of spiritual water at Crescent Mountain, the use of the spiritual water was only to enable the soil in Crescent Mountain to transform into spiritual soil. Also, not all of the spiritual water was able to transform into pure yang water.Therefore, the transforming of Crescent Mountain still had to go according to Zhang Han\u2019s original plan. First, finish with the areas in the back of the mountain, then slowly finish with the residential area and areas at the front of the mountain.\u201cI still have to rent a house.\u201dZhang Han muttered to himself, then immediately took out his phone and dialed Manager Ma\u2019s phone number.Hearing that Zhang Han wants to rent a house, Manager Ma was very enthusiastic. It makes sense that Manager Ma was enthusiastic. After all, Manager Ma got a reward of 1million rmb from Zhang Han\u2019s house deal.Manager Ma requested Zhang Han to come to his company to take a look at the photos of the different houses and furthermore promised that he would not take any commission fee when Zhang Han rented a house through him, indirectly conveying his gratitude towards Zhang Han.Zhang Han did not say anything and straightforwardly drove towards Manager Ma\u2019s company. The company was situated at a small retail store at a back street. Within the small retail store, there was a total of 13 employees.Manager Ma stood right at the doorway. Upon seeing Zhang Han arrive, he enthusiastically welcomed him,\u201cWelcome Mr Zhang. Come, have a sit inside.\u201dEntering into the store and sat on the sofa, Manager Ma took out a carton of peppermint flavor cigarette which cost 20 rmb. After passing over a cigarette to Zhang Han and also helped Zhang Han lighted up the cigarette, Manager Ma lighted up a cigarette for himself, then asked with a smile,\u201cNot sure what kind of house Mr Zhang want to rent?\u201d\u201cA house in Crescent Gulf. One that is slightly better than normal too.\u201d\u201cSlightly better than normal?\u201d Manager Ma muttered to himself, then said, \u201cFor better ones, there are villas, where the rents are about 4million rmb every year. There are also scenery viewing houses, where 1.5million rmb would be needed every year for those that are 100squares meter and above. As for the other small size houses and apartment houses, I feel that Mr Zhang would not be interested.\u201d\u201cHmmm, are there any photos?\u201d Zhang Han asked.\u201cYes, there are photos. Follow me Mr Zhang.\u201dHearing that, Manager Ma stood up and brought Zhang Han to the front of his computer table. At the computer table, Manager Ma began searching for houses that were around Crescent Gulf.Manager Ma showed Zhang Han all the villas and family houses at Crescent Gulf to Zhang Han.There were all sorts of interior decoration. Some were western style oriented, some were modern style oriented, but there were only a few which caught Zhang Han\u2019s attention.\u201cWhere is this villa located at?\u201d Zhang Han pointed to a villa.This villa was the only villa which caught Zhang Han\u2019s attention. The renovation was not exaggeratingly luxurious, and the house had a mix color of white, blue and grass green, giving the house a kind of fresh feeling that one was close to nature.However, the rent of the villa was somewhat expensive, where the cost of the rent was 4.5million rmb each year.\u201cThis villa is located at Yongxing Road. Yongxing Road is located at the middle of the zone between Crescent Gulf and Bamboo District.\u201d Manager Ma said.\u201cIt is somewhat far\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s brows raised.The ideal location of the house in Zhang Han\u2019s mind was one that was near to Crescent Mountain. That way, he can go to the mountain whenever he wants. If the house he was staying at was far away from Crescent Mountain, it would be quite troublesome for him.\u201cFar?\u201d Manager Ma went into a daze for a while, then asked, \u201cWhere do Mr Zhang want to rent a house at?\u201d\u201cA house that is near Crescent Mountain.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cNear Crescent Mountain\u2026\u2026\u201d Manager Ma began pondering and searched for houses near Crescent Mountain. However, there was no suitable house that was located near Crescent Mountain.\u201cIs Mr Zhang living alone?\u201d Unable to find any house that Zhang Han was truly satisfied with, Manager Ma was somewhat discouraged. While thinking about a solution, he began chatting with Zhang Han.\u201cI am living with my daughter. The main thing for getting a house is to cook delicious food for her.\u201d Meng Meng\u2019s adorable little figure floated by Zhang Han\u2019s mind and a trace of smile was hang on the corner of his mouth.\u201cCook food?\u201d Manager Ma\u2019s eyes lighted up as he said, \u201cI think that there is a solution which is possible. With Mr Zhang\u2019s unique taste (picky) towards decoration, I think that you can rent a small retail house. For small retail houses, you can renovate it however you want, while residence houses are quite troublesome if you want to renovate it.\u201d\u201cRetail house?\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s eyes squinted.Open a restaurant?That is possible. Meng Meng is currently only 3 years old and the amount of food she can eat is quite little. The extra food that are made can be used to sell and most importantly, the renovation can be casually renovated to my taste.The renovation part was something which Zhang Han was more concerned of. Pursuing quality lifestyle, Zhang Han would never mistreat himself. Furthermore, there was now Meng Meng! That was the little princess who should even more not be mistreated!Thus, Zhang Han nodded his head and said,\u201cThat is okay too. Are there any photos to look at?\u201d\u201cThere are.\u201d Manager Ma laughed, then searched for the retail houses that were near Crescent Mountain.At the start, the retail houses that were searched up were all small retail houses that were 60-70 square meter big. In Manager Ma\u2019s view, those retail houses were more than enough for Zhang Han to live in with his daughter.But Zhang Han kept on shaking his head, \u201cToo small, take a look at the bigger ones instead.\u201dThus, Manager Ma began searching for bigger retail houses. Finally, after looking at more than 20+ retail houses, Manager Ma saw Zhang Han nodded his head at one of the retail house.\u201cThis house is a 2 floor retail house. The first floor is the restaurant and the second floor is the household. This retail house is managed by an elderly husband and wife. The location of this retail house is the nearest to Crescent Mountain. I went to the retail house two times during the past few days and the business there is quite good. If it were not for the elderly husband and wife having to take care of their grandson, they would also not rent out the retail house.\u201dWhile introducing the retail house, Manager Ma opened the photos of the retail house,\u201cThe first floor is quite simple. It is 130 square meter big and there is a breakfast counter and some tables and chairs. The second floor is a family orientated household. The renovation is quite decent and the structure is 2 room and 1 living room. The house faces against the south and the daylighting is good. To sum it all up, the renovation space of the house is very big and I feel that it is very suitable for you.\u201dZhang Han looked at the few photos and finally nodded his head in satisfaction,\u201cThis house is okay.\u201d\u201cThe total cost is 4million rmb, which covers for 1year and 3month rent. Is Mr Zhang satisfied with the price of this house? If not, I feel that it is still possible to negotiate with them and lower the price.\u201d Manager Ma said with a smile.\u201cThere is no need to negotiate.\u201d\u201cAlright. Then, let me bring you over to take a look at the house.\u201dManager Ma smiled, as he stood up and brought Zhang Han to his car. The car that he drove was a black color Honda Accord.In Xiangjiang, those who have a car normally have quite a pretty decent life. The cars in Xiangjiang were not expensive and were many times cheaper compared to cars in mainland China. After all, there was less tax in Xiangjiang.With Manager Ma taking the lead, the two of them came to Dawn Road to take a look at the restaurant.On the road, Manager Ma had already contacted the elderly wife and husband. Thus, when they entered the house, they immediately saw a married couple who were in their fifties sitting at the living room chatting.Upon seeing people, the married couple greeted them, then brought Zhang Han to take a look around the house. The structure on the second floor was quite decent. There were not many furniture as most of them had already been moved away. On a whole, the second floor was very clean. On the first floor, most of the furniture and goods were still there.With the size of 130 meter square, the living room was originally very big. But after using two wall to make a kitchen, the living room appeared to be not that big.The structure was not bad and the renovation space was very big, thus Zhang Han immediately rented the retail house. Manager Ma gave both sides a contract to sign on. After both sides signed the contract, starting from now, the restaurant belonged to Zhang Han for a year and three months.After the elderly married couple left, Manager Ma and Zhang Han sat on the chairs at the living room.\u201cLet me transfer you the commission fee.\u201dZhang Han opened his mouth and said, but Manager Ma shook his head and rejected,\u201cMr Zhang, I am very grateful that you chose me to deal your house. Therefore, there is no need to bring up about the commission fee.\u201dHearing that, Zhang Han smiled and shook his head, then asked, \u201cDo you know any renovation company?\u201d\u201cYeah. Do you need me to contact them for you now?\u201d Manager Ma replied.\u201cYeah.\u201dManager Ma made a phone call to a renovation company right in front of Zhang Han, and in less than 30minutes, two male who wore western suit knocked and walked into the house.One of the males was a square face middle age man, and the other was a 25 years old youth who wore glasses.\u201cHello Mr Zhang, I am Blue Road Renovation Company\u2019s manager, Zhao Kai.\u201d The middle age man greeted with a smile.Taking a look at the house, Zhao Kai felt that the decoration of the house should be a few years old and had been maintained pretty well, thus thought to himself that Zhang Han was probably wanting to either revamp or make a small change to the house. Thus, Zhao Kai opened his mouth and asked,\u201cMr Zhang, how do you want to renovate the house? Do you want to revamp the house or remodel a part of the house that you are not fond of?\u201dHowever, Zhang Han\u2019s answer made him somewhat dumbfounded.\u201cTear down the house and renovate from scratch.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dApart from Manager Ma, both Zhao Kai and the youth was dazed.\u201cFor the first floor, tear down everything and renovate it from scratch. For the second floor, renovate it with its original structure.\u201d Zhang Han added on.Big deal!Zhao Kai\u2019s eyes lighted up and asked hurriedly,\u201cDo Mr Zhang want the full package or half package?\u201dFull package means that the renovation company cover full work and full materials. The price of full package was also much higher compared to half package. As for the half package, it means that the company cover light engineering and supplementary materials. The main materials like floor tiles, wall bricks, and boards and so on other main materials would have to be provided by Zhang Han himself.Liked it?

    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - DecorationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat materials do you all have for the full package? Zhang Han casually asked.About things regarding renovation, Zhang Han had learned quite a bit of it back then. Although the things he knew about renovation was not much, it was still at the least enough for him to not get conned easily by someone else.\u201cOur company has retail stores at Xilong Renovation Market, and furthermore have cooperation relationship with quite a few international brand shops, therefore, whatever decoration and materials that Mr Zhang you would want, we have it all. Moreover, the price will definitely be cheaper compared to you personally going to the shop to buy.\u201d Zhao Kai replied truthfully.This kind of situation was normally mutually beneficial. Zhao Kai\u2019s company would buy the materials at wholesale price, then sell the materials to the buyer at a profitable price. This way, the company could earn money, and the buyers could also save some money too.Of course, for this kind of situation to work, the inner quality of a company matters too. If a company were to substitute the materials with fake materials, the buyers could only count themselves unlucky.\u201cI will take the full package then.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head and said.Hearing that, Zhao Kai\u2019s smile became more enthusiastic. Taking the ipad over from the youth\u2019s hand, he opened up the photo album and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure what kind of renovation style Mr Zhang wants? This is our company\u2019s renovation examples, you can take a look first. After you have decided, when we go back today, we will make drawings according to your opinion to provide for you to choose.\u201dZhang Han began to look at the pictures on the ipad, while Manager Ma took his leave and left after picking up a phone call.After looking for a while, Zhang Han had his own opinion. He intends to renovate the first floor to family style, and not business store type.The structure of the first floor was very simple, there was only a staircase at the inner left side, and a toilet at the right side. For the remaining space, it was just the living room. The door faced towards the south and was located at between two very wide French windows.Zhang Han muttered to himself for a while, then said out his opinion.\u201cAt somewhere near the middle, make a television wall at the wall in the east side. In front of the television wall, place a sofa and coffee table.This way, Meng Meng can watch the television when she is waiting for me to cook for her. The kitchen will be on the west side, and it will be a square shape open kitchen. The stove will be placed at the side facing towards the television. This way, I can look at Meng Meng while I cook.Near the television, a small stage can be built there for me to put a piano. When I am free, I can teach Meng Meng to play the piano, which is pretty nice. Near the piano, and at the corner near to the door, I can put a small high table there and place a laptop on the small high table, then at the surroundings, I can install some high-quality sound system. That way, when eating, I can play some music to listen to.At the place near the window and sofa, place a small round table and four ball-shaped chairs. It will be the corner for eating snacks and drinking beverages. At the outer side, place a dinner table, and a big crystal chandelier on top of the dinner table. Also, around the surroundings of the dinner table, I want some decorations.\u201d\u201cMr Zhang, the workload of those things that you speak of are not big. There will also be no problem in the renovation.\u201dZhao Kai opened his phone\u2019s calculator and said while calculating,\u201cI will speak about the specific works. Floor tiles, kitchen\u2019s wall bricks, a small area of integrated ceiling at the kitchen, rest of the ceilings, television wall, small stage, few other furniture, the cost of tearing down the original decorations, and also the cost of the revamp of the second floor. Not counting the materials, the total fee for the manual work cost 150k rmb.\u201d\u201cHow long will it take for you all to finish the renovation?\u201d Zhang Han asked.\u201cAbout 20+ days should be enough.\u201d Zhao Kai muttered for a while, then replied.\u201cOne week!\u201d Zhang Han raised up a finger and said lightly, \u201cFinish the renovation in a week. I will give you 300k rmb for the manual work fee!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dZhao Kai thought he didn\u2019t hear clearly at first and went into a daze for a while, then followed by being overjoyed at the unexpected good news and quickly nodded his head and said, \u201cAlright, alright! The renovation will be finished within a week. Then, Mr Zhang, do you want to hand over some down payment first? It is currently 3pm. I can call people to come down to tear down the original decorations right now. Before night, they will most likely be able to finish tearing down the original decorations.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dZhang Han signed a contract with Zhao Kai, then immediately transferred 300k rmb over to Zhao Kai.After signing the contract, Zhao Kai contacted people to come down. Within less than 30 minutes, 2 pickup trucks arrived at the door. Within the 2 pickup trucks, there were a total of 5 workers.\u201cMr Zhang, about those chairs, tables and\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhao Kai asked with hesitation.\u201cHandle it as you wish.\u201d Zhang Han waved his hand.Zhao Kai slightly smiled. All of those chairs, tables and other various items could be sold for at least 2k-3k rmb, which could be counted as a small tiny profit.\u201cMr Zhang, I will let people to start working with the drawings, and at night you will be able to choose from one of the 3D drawings. After you finish choosing, we will be able to start working tomorrow.\u201d Zhao Kai said with a smile.\u201cI will draw a simple drawing for you first. You all can just follow according to my drawing and refine upon it.\u201dZhang Han was well aware of how he wanted to renovate the house. Taking over the paper Zhao Kai handed over to him, Zhang Han began drawing according to the design in his mind. Although the drawing was ordinary, the specific details and shapes could still be made out.Seeing Zhang Han\u2019s drawing, the corner of Zhao Kai\u2019s mouth twitched.Seems like the carpenters will have to suffer for a bit. Not sure how did he even think of those exquisite designs. The designs appeared to be very fitting and pleasing to the eyes, especially the three dimensional small fences surroundings of the dinner table.\u201cOh yeah, I want to make a jadeite lotus decoration on the television wall. The petals have to be a crossover of pink and white.\u201d Zhang Han added.\u201cJadeite\u2026\u2026lotus\u2026\u2026television wall decoration?\u201d Zhao Kai opened his eyes fully wide and said out the sentence with difficulty.The workload that he thought was little, now seems to actually be the contrary.Just the television wall decoration alone was more than enough to cause headache. Furthermore, the estimated cost of just this television wall decoration alone was above a million rmb!\u201cThis\u2026\u2026Mr Zhang.\u201d Zhao Kai laughed bitterly, \u201cAccording to your opinion, I think 7 days is not enough.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s expression did not change as he said lightly, \u201cI will give you 500k rmb of manual work fee then.\u201d7 days was not enough? Add money then.Upon hearing that, Zhao Kai went into a daze again. While feeling pleasantly surprised in his heart, he also somewhat sighed in his heart. It was the first time that he actually met with such a\u2026\u2026unconventional customer.Some customer would also give tips, but the tips they gave would not be a lot. For someone like Zhang Han who increases the price of manual work fee after a few exchanging of words, it was still the first time for Zhao Kai to encounter!\u201cAlright, I guarantee that the renovation will be completed within 7 days.\u201d Zhao Kai took a deep breath and gave his guarantee. He had already decided to double the number of workers and renovate 24hr every day for this forthright customer.\u201cMr Zhang, the time is pressing. Do you have any materials that you would want for the materials of the floor tiles, wall bricks and ceilings? Or else, how about you come with me to Xilong Renovation Market to choose the materials that you want?\u201d After Zhao Kai instructed the youth beside him to quickly go work with the drawings, he turned around and said to Zhang Han.Zhang Han nodded his head and followed along with Zhao Kai to Xilong Renovation Market. At the first store, they came to a high-end international brand ceramic tile store. After seeing something that he was satisfied with, Zhang Han immediately ordered it.The floor tile that Zhang Han chose was the pseudo-classic bricks which belonged to the mocha palace series. A square meter cost 2500 rmb. Adding the wall bricks, skirting board and other things, the total came around to 490k rmb. As for the materials for the ceilings and cement, sand and so on other supplementary materials, the total came around to close to 300k rmb. The reason why the price of those materials was expensive was all because that the materials that Zhang Han chose were all high-end, formaldehyde-free environmentally friendly materials. After the renovation was complete, he would be able to immediately start staying in the house.After spending close to an hour to buy the materials, Zhao Kai saw that there was still time, and thus asked,\u201cMr Zhang, the time is still early right now. Should we go to the furniture marketplace and take a look at the sofa, exhaust hood and so on other furniture? This way, we can just straightforwardly help you install the furniture when we renovate.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head.The two of them went straight to the furniture market in the vicinity and undergo another round of shopping.The sofa that would be placed in front of the sofa was a white color high-end leather sofa, which had the shape of a bent moon and the length of 4 meters. The cost of the sofa was not expensive. Only 40k rmb. Not expensive!For the television, coffee table, chairs, and tables, those were all much easier to choose. For the first floor and second floor, Zhang Han spent up to a total of 500k rmb. The cost included the bathtub, smart toilet bowl, smart washing machine, 4 doors large-scale fridge, air conditioners, air purifiers and so on other items.After finish buying everything and they were intending to leave, Zhao Kai suddenly thought of a matter, and asked with a somewhat astonished expression,\u201cMr Zhang, aren\u2019t you\u2026opening a restaurant? There doesn\u2019t seem to be a place for the customers to sit and eat at.\u201d\u201cCustomers?\u201dZhang Han went into a daze. He also forgot about this matter. After thinking for a while, he opened his mouth and said,\u201cThere is still a small space at the place near the right window right? Place 3 small table there will do.\u201dUpon hearing that, the corner of Zhao Kai\u2019s mouth could not help but twitched a bit. He felt that Zhang Han was not opening a restaurant at all and was just messing around!Thus, Zhang Han bought 3 small tables and 6 chairs, spending a total of\u20261k rmb.Since it was for outsiders to use, it would be enough as long as the furniture seems clean.At all the stores where they bought things, for the contact information, Zhao Kai\u2019s phone number was used instead of Zhang Han\u2019s. Zhao Kai very seriously took pictures of each and every furniture, which were to be used when making the pictures tonight. At the same time, he also guaranteed to give Zhang Han an entirely new restaurant within a week.After getting on the car, Zhang Han and Zhao Kai exchanged contact information with each other.Suddenly, Zhao Kai recalled that they did not buy a piano and thus asked,\u201cMr Zhang, can I know what kind of piano do you want? I have a friend who works in a piano store. I can help you ask around.\u201d\u201cPiano\u2026\u2026\u201dZhang Han muttered to himself. Zhang Han understood quite a bit about piano. When he was small, he had learned before piano. In the cultivation world, he also made a piano because he was bored. During the time of 500 years, he would play the piano occasionally. Under such a long time, his understanding towards piano was already very profound. Incorrect, it should be said that, his understanding towards piano music was already very profound.For the brand of the piano, Zhang Han did not intend to buy a cheap one. Some people would say that a piano\u2019s quality was not in the price of the piano and was in the tone. Towards that, Zhang Han felt that it was a bunch of nonsense. Let alone the reasoning of \u2018you get what you pay for\u2019, to speak about the quality, expensive pianos were much better than cheap pianos. To want to live a quality life, how could the things that were going to be used be bad?For example, the seven colors serene piano that Zhang Han used back when he was at the Cultivation World. The piano was made with the Cultivation World\u2019s top quality materials. It could still be remembered that back when Zhang Han played canon variation at a planet, the sound caused the people in the entire planet to be bewitched within it. Even more, if Zhang Han wanted, the piano sound could even be turned into killing sound and instantly wipe out the life of the planet.\u2026\u2026Speaking far already.Zhang Han muttered to himself, then said forthrightly,\u201cBuy a Steinway Model O Grand Piano.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhao Kai did not know much about piano and straightforwardly nodded his head and called his friend.A minute later.\u201cPfff\u2026\u2026how much?\u201d The pitch of Zhao Kai\u2019s voice raised. Afterward, he looked at Zhang Han with a stupefied gaze. His lips wiggled and said out,\u201cMr Zhang, the piano that you said cost 1.1million rmb. Guaranteed to be a genuine imported product.\u201d\u201cCan.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head.1.1million rmb was also the market price. Thus, Zhang Han immediately agreed. After passing over the restaurant\u2019s key to Zhao Kai, Zhang Han went to find a hotel to stay at.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After subtracting the mountain rent which was 12million rmb, there was still 7.6million rmb left.3million rmb for renting house, 500k rmb for manual work fee, 500k rmb for ceramic tiles, 300k for supplementary materials, 1million rmb for the television wall, 500k rmb for the furniture, 1.1million rmb for the piano, which was a total of 6.9million rmb. This also meant that, after Zhang Han finished signing the contract for the renting of Crescent Mountain tomorrow, he would be left with around 700k rmb. This was not enough to support him to stay in a president suite.\u201cPfff\u2026\u2026\u201d The girl receptionist who was receiving Zhang Han could not help but laugh, as she handed over the room card to Zhang Han with all smiles and said, \u201cHere, your president standard room.\u201dZhang Han took a look ineffably at the girl who was laughing.According to the hotel standard and strict system, even if he had changed what he wanted to said, the receptionist should not be able allowed to straight out laugh like that!It was reckoned that the receptionist was a big family\u2019s young lady who was working here just to experience life.After taking over the room card, Zhang Han did not go to his room immediately, and instead went to a restaurant to eat dinner.When the time came to 7pm, Liu Meng called Zhang Han to inform him to go find him tomorrow at morning 9am to sign the contract for the renting of the mountain.Returning back to the room, Zhang Han lied down on the bed. His gaze was looking at the television, but his mind was filled with Meng Meng that little princess.He was missing his daughter.At the other side, Yunyin Garden, Zi Yan and Zhou Fei just arrived back home.\u201cWe have finally finished picking 100 garbage songs!\u201d Zhou Fei said petulantly. Her face was filled with exhaustion.\u201cIt has been hard on you, Xiao Fei.\u201d Zi Yan lightly smiled and said, \u201cTomorrow after we filter out 12 songs from the 100 songs, it will not be that tiring anymore.\u201dListening to songs should have been a wonderful matter. A song that was good was able to indirectly affect other\u2019s mood. Songs that were cheerful were able to make others feel cheerful, songs that were sad were about to make others start tearing up, songs that were melodious were able to make others relax that tense mental state.And the songs that Zi Yan and Zhou Fei listened to, the effect those songs had on them, was nothing but suffering!It was fine even if the songs were unpleasant to listen to, but there should also at least be a limit to how bad the songs were! Some of the songs were even extremely unbearable to listen to. But even if that was the case, the two of them still listened to hundreds of songs. Those past 2 days were just like an ordeal for them.\u201cBig Sister Yan, if you had 4 real high-quality songs, this upcoming album of yours would still at least be able to cause quite a bit of sensation. But those songs that we have now are just too terrible already.\u201d Zhou Fei said with a face full of indignant, \u201cFurthermore, I heard that apart from Xu Ruoyu who received 8 high-quality songs, another third-rate singer actually also got 2 high-quality songs. It is obvious that the \u2018high quality\u2019 songs that the witch gave you were just some random songs she found from the company\u2019s music library. I think that we should not compete with Xu Ruoyu on the fifteenth.\u201dUpon hearing that, Zi Yan frowned and said obstinately, \u201cNo, we will release the album on the fifteenth!\u201dAs someone who was once one of the most popular celebrities in China, Zi Yan has her own pride!How could a mere Xu Ruoyu be able to make her lower her head!\u201cAlright, we will fight with all we have then!\u201d Zhou Fei smiled and shook her head. In her heart, she felt somewhat helpless. She knew that there was no use in persuading Zi Yan as Zi Yan was very obstinate in this aspect. Those words that she said just now was but merely just her being grouchy only.\u201cI\u2019m going to look for Meng Meng.\u201d Zi Yan shook her head and slightly smiled, as she changed into slippers and walked towards the second floor.Only when facing her daughter, then would Zi Yan often reveal out a smile.\u201cForget your friend when you have your daughter. Humph.\u201d Zhou Fei rolled her eyes and mumbled, \u201cMeng Meng this, Meng Meng that. Didn\u2019t you say that you did not approve of the name that the fellow gave for the little fellow?\u201dJust when Zi Yan reached the staircase, she immediately heard the little princess crying on the second floor.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Meng Meng?\u201d Zi Yan quickly walked up to the second floor, and upon seeing the little princess crying, she immediately walked over and hugged the little princess in her embrace.At the side, housekeeper Wang Juan was somewhat anxious. She herself was also quite confused. Everything was fine until out of nowhere, the little princess just started crying all of a sudden.\u201cI miss my daddy very much!(\u6211\u597d\u60f3\u6211\u7239\u54cb\u5440!)\u201dNormally, Meng Meng would also be able to speak fluent Chinese. But when she gets anxious, she would instead use English to express what she wants to say.After hearing that, Zi Yan\u2019s expression froze as she said with a helpless tone, \u201cDidn\u2019t mommy already told you? After your daddy finishes with his things, he will come and find you.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026but I want to see him now. Mommy, can you let daddy come accompany Meng Meng?\u201d Meng Meng said pitifully.\u201cMeng Meng!\u201d Zi Yan slightly frowned and said, \u201cIf you continue to be like this, mommy will be angry already!\u201d\u201cBoohoo, boohoo, I don\u2019t want you to hug anymore.\u201d Meng Meng began struggling around in Zi Yan\u2019s embrace, with a heartbroken look on her face.Upon seeing that, Zi Yan felt both angry and helpless at the same time.Why? They were only together for 5 days and it was like this already?However, when Zi Yan\u2019s gaze saw that the television was currently showing an interaction program between father and children, she understood just what had happened.Lightly sighed, after having Auntie Wang closed the television, Zi Yan said tenderly,\u201cMeng Meng, don\u2019t cry, be obedient. Mommy also loves you very much. Can you tell mommy why you miss daddy?\u201d\u201cIt is just that\u2026I want to play with daddy.\u201d Meng Meng said in a low voice.\u201cWhat do you play together with your daddy? Is it very fun?\u201d Zi Yan said, trying to divert Meng Meng\u2019s attention.\u201cIt is very fun! Daddy brought me go to the mountain. A lot a lot of cars were there.When daddy was driving the car, he was very fast, and the sound was very very big! Those bad people talked bad about daddy. But\u2026but later on, they all complemented that daddy was very powerful.\u201d Meng Meng stopped crying and answered as she pondered.After finish listening, Zi Yan\u2019s face turned black!This scoundrel! He actually brought his daughter to car racing? He is truly a scoundrel!Zi Yan was angry to hell in her heart, but the smile was still maintained on her face as she asked, \u201cThen what else did your daddy brought you go play?\u201d\u201cDaddy also brought me to go sit the big bird and go to Disneyland to play. Mommy, Disneyland is very fun! In Disneyland, there are a lot a lot of fun things to play. Meng Meng still wants to go to Disneyland again.\u201d When talking about Disneyland, Meng Meng\u2019s eyes lighted up.After hearing that, there was regret and disappointed hidden in Zi Yan\u2019s expression.Meng Meng has grown till so big and yet I have not even brought her to a theme park before.If Zhang Han that fellow had not brought Meng Meng to Disneyland to play before, and left behind a deep impression in Meng Meng\u2019s heart, Zi Yan would also not had made this kind of decision. It could be heard from Zi Yan as she opened her mouth to speak,\u201cMeng Meng, then how about mommy also bring you go Disneyland play during the day after tomorrow?\u201dShe decided to squeeze out all her energy to focus on her work tomorrow, then properly accompany Meng Meng to play for an entire day during the day after tomorrow.\u201cEh?\u201dMeng Meng first went into a daze, followed by her eyes lighting up and clapping her hands as she shouted happily, \u201cAlright, alright! Go Disneyland play, go Disneyland play! Mommy is the best!\u201dAfter finish speaking, the adorable Meng Meng pouted her mouth and lightly kissed Zi Yan\u2019s cheek.Upon seeing that, Zhou Fei who was at the side said with a smile, \u201cMeng Meng, give Aunt Feifei a kiss too.\u201dAfter finish speaking, Zhou Fei lower down her body and waited for the little princess\u2019s kiss. However, after waiting for a while, she did not see any movement from the little princess.\u201cUhhuh, I am not kissing.\u201d Meng Meng stared at Zhou Fei with her clear eyes as she shook her head and said.\u201cOh?\u201d Zhou Fei went into a daze for a while, then said, \u201cLittle fellow, last time when aunt let you kiss, you would kiss. Why did you change now? Humph! Quickly come give me Aunt Feifei a kiss, or else Aunt Feifei is going to be angry.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want, I am not kissing.\u201d Meng Meng immediately hid in Zi Yan\u2019s embrace.Upon seeing that, Zi Yan thought that it was because Meng Meng was somewhat shy and could not help but hanged up a smile in the corner of her mouth.Zhou Fei pouted her mouth and said, \u201cMeng Meng, do you not like Aunt Feifei anymore?\u201d\u201cLike\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng answered with her cute voice.\u201cThen why do you not want to Aunt Feifei anymore?\u201d Zhou Fei was confused about this matter.\u201cDaddy said I cannot kiss.\u201d Meng Meng said with a serious face, \u201cDaddy said that, apart from daddy and mommy, Meng Meng cannot kiss anyone else, or else I would fall sick.\u201dZhou Fei\u2019s expression froze.Upon seeing that, Zi Yan could not help but laughed. This Zhou Fei who had a ruthless mouth would only be defeated in front of Meng Meng. Looking at Zhou Fei being defeated, Zi Yan felt that it was very funny.However, what Meng Meng said next made Zi Yan\u2019s face turned black.\u201cDaddy\u2026daddy also said that I should kiss mommy less, because\u2026because when i kiss mommy, I would kiss a mouthful of cosmetic foundation. Daddy said that cosmetic foundation is not clean.\u201d Meng Meng recalled of the words that Zhang Han had said to her.\u201cPfff\u2026\u2026.\u201d Seeing Zi Yan\u2019s blackened face, it became Zhou Fei\u2019s turn to laugh this time.\u201cYour daddy is right. Meng Meng, I think that you should also not kiss your mommy anymore in the future!\u201d Zhou Fei mumbled.\u201cThis scoundrel!\u201d Zi Yan gnashed her teeth with anger.\u201cUhuh! Mommy, you are not allowed to talk badly about daddy. Mommy, I want to talk with daddy. Can you call him please?\u201d The little princess said with her cute voice.\u201cSure! I will call him!\u201d Zi Yan immediately took out her phone and dialed Zhang Han\u2019s phone number.\u201cZhang Han!\u201d When the phone call connected, Zi Yan said petulantly, \u201cHow did you even teach Meng Meng? What is wrong with Meng Meng kissing me? Do my face have that much cosmetic foundation? I obviously very rarely put on makeup okay? Moreover, there is practically no cosmetic foundation with that little bit of light makeup that i put on! Humph! Rigid brain! Meng Meng wants to talk to you!\u201dZi Yan spoke finish everything in one breath. When seeing that, Meng Meng was actually somewhat unsatisfied with it, but when she saw Zi Yan handed the phone over to her, she immediately took over the phone with great joy.\u201cDid this woman ate the wrong medicine?\u201dWhile Zhang Han was thinking to himself, Meng Meng\u2019s voice transmitted out from the phone.\u201cZhang Han! Guess who am I?\u201d Meng Meng imitated her mother\u2019s tone and spoke.\u201cI guess\u2026\u2026you are\u2026\u2026the beautiful and adorable little princess, Meng Meng?\u201d Zhang Han said tenderly.\u201cIncorrect, incorrect, I am not Meng Meng. I\u2026I am Yan Yan!\u201d Meng Meng spoke, while still imitating her mother\u2019s tone.Hearing that, Zhou Fei could not help but laugh, while Zi Yan rolled her eyes petulantly.\u201cYan Yan?\u201d Zhang Han smiled, then deepened his tone as he said, \u201cCough, cough, Yan Yan, where is Meng Meng? I miss her already, let her get on the phone!\u201d\u201cOh, alright then. You wait for a while.\u201d Meng Meng spoke, then placed the phone away from her ear. Two seconds later, she brought the phone back to her ear and spoke in her cute voice, \u201cDaddy, I am Meng Meng. I miss you so much.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhang Han laughed heartily, then said, \u201cDaddy also miss you very much.\u201d\u201cDaddy, when are you coming to come find me to play?\u201d Meng Meng asked.\u201cDaddy will go come and pick you up in a week.\u201d\u201cOh, there are still so many days. That\u2019s right, daddy, mommy is going to bring me to Disneyland during the day after tomorrow. Daddy can you come with us also?\u201d Meng Meng straightforwardly sent out her own invitation to Zhang Han.\u201cSure.\u201dHearing that her daddy agreed, Meng Meng felt extremely happy and began chuckling. After speaking a huge bunch of words, Meng Meng then hanged up the phone.\u201cMommy, mommy, daddy said that we are not going to go to Disneyland this time. We are going to go to other theme parks to play.\u201d Meng Meng raised her hands and said.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Daddy said that there are a lot of fishes at Ocean Park, and that there are Ferris wheel and cable car to ride on.\u201d Meng Meng said with her face full of anticipation.\u201cOh.\u201d Zi Yan responded, as her gaze was somewhat lost in thought and her heart was somewhat in a mess.Originally, she intended for Zhou Fei and herself to accompany Meng Meng to play. But with Zhang Han joining in, it seemed to become just like a family outing.Could this\u2026be counted as a family?Perhaps.Zi Yan\u2019s heart was at a loss. She did not know she should treat Zhang Han. But right now, at the least, what she could confirm was that how she treated Zhang Han was not the same as how she treated others. Otherwise, she would also not kept on getting angry at Zhang Han.Zi Yan shook her head and stopped thinking about those things. After playing with Meng Meng for a while, it was time to rest.Before Meng Meng went to bed, she was still looking forward to the family outing on the day after tomorrow. Just taking a look at Meng Meng\u2019s giggling and excited expression was able to let one know that.Mommy and daddy accompanying her to play together were the time that she felt the happiest.Right when it was about to reach 11 pm, Zhao Kai send to Zhang Han five different 3D interior image of the restaurant. Zhang Han picked the one that he liked the most and Zhao Kai replied that the renovation will began tomorrow.A night without words.The next day, morning 9 am, Zhang Han punctually arrived at the main entrance of Land Departments Office.\u201cWelcome Mr Zhang.\u201d Liu Meng welcomed Zhang Han with a face full of smiles.\u201cEn.\u201d Zhang Han lightly nodded his head.(\u55ef \u2013 En: A groaning sound made, normally indicating the meaning of \u2018yeah\u2019 or \u2018okay\u2019. If a ? was placed behind En, for example \u2018En?\u2019, it most probably meant something like \u2018hmmm?\u2019)\u201cCome, step inside.\u201d Liu Meng said with a smile, \u201cI will bring you to go sign the contract now.\u201dAfter finish speaking, Liu Meng led the way in front of Zhang Han. When they arrived in front of an office, Liu Meng\u2019s expression paused, then turned his head backward and softly reminded,\u201cMr Zhang, the person that will be signing the contract with you is Director Wang, Wang QiShan. He is in charge of the land around Crescent Gulf. His temper is not that good, therefore, if he is to say any harsh words later on, Mr Zhang you will have to pardon him a bit.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Zhang Han responded dully.After Liu Meng finished knocking on the door, he stood right at the spot and waited silently. After waiting for a full minute, then did a rough voice came from within the office,\u201cCome in!\u201dRight after opening the door, they immediately saw a female who was in her twenties walked out from the office with her face blushing.\u201cHaha.\u201d Zhang Han grinned. This Director Wang sure was amorous.After entering the office, Wang QiShan could be seen sitting right at the office table. Wang QiShan was a middle age man in his forties. He had a bald head, thin face and wore a glasses that was over 400 degrees.\u201cSpeak.\u201d Wang QiShan said coldly. Listening to his tone, it seems that he did not really welcome people to come to his office.Liu Meng\u2019s expression was somewhat awkward as he said in a low voice, \u201cDirector Wang, it is the matter that I talked to you about yesterday. Mr Zhang has come to sign the contract.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Hearing that, Wang QiShan did not bother to raise his head, and also did not even bother to take a look at Zhang Han. He was still messing around with the computer on his office table as he said coldly, \u201cWe will speak about this after I finished handling my work.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d Liu Meng nodded his head repeatedly. After taking a look at Zhang Han with a somewhat apologetic look, the two of them sat down on the sofa at the side.After waiting for about 30minutes, then did Wang QiShan raised his head. He first took a few looks at Zhang Han, then took out a stack of documents from the drawer and threw it on the table, \u201cThe documents are here. Go to the financial department and hand over the money first, then come to my office to stamp the documents.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Liu Meng slightly bended over his body and took the documents, then signaled Zhang Han, as he took the lead and walk out of the office.Zhang Han stood up, then took a few looks at Wang QiShan with a somewhat dissatisfied look.Just taking out a stack of documents only and this person could also drag it for 30minutes. What an interesting person. If this was the Cultivation World, this kind of people would not be able to live for more than a day.\u201cMr Zhang, my apologies.\u201dOutside the office door, Liu Meng smiled awkwardly.\u201cLet\u2019s go hand over the payment.\u201d Zhang Han dully responded.At the financial department, after swiping the bank card and deducted 10million rmb, the financial department stamped a few stamps on the documents. However, when they returned back to Director Wang\u2019s office, they discovered that Director Wang himself was missing.After waiting for 30minutes, then did they saw Director Wang walking back into the office in high spirits.\u201cDirector Wang, the money has already been handed over to the financial department. All that is left is to wait for you to stamp the documents.\u201d Liu Meng quickly stood up and with a smile.\u201cEn, come.\u201d The way Wang QiShan spoke was as if that he was using his nose to speak, letting others who heard it often felt unhappy.After Wang QiShan entered the office and finished stamping the documents, he took the documents and looked towards Zhang Han, as he said, \u201cYou are Mr Zhang?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you asking the obvious?\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s eyelid did not even raise the tiny bit.\u201cEn?\u201d Wang QiShan\u2019s expression sunk. A flame of anger raised up within his gaze.Liu Meng was frightened to the point that his face turned pale as he quickly signaled Zhang Han with his gaze. However, Zhang Han did not paid any attention to him, and instead look towards Wang QiShan and said with a dissatisfied tone,\u201cWhat are you en-ing about? Quickly pass me the contract!\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Wang QiShan glared at Zhang Han and said angrily.\u201cDo you not have ears?\u201d Zhang Han looked towards Wang QiShan\u2019s ears with a confused expression and said, \u201cYour gaze was already not functioning well. If your ears were to not function well too, that would be somewhat tragic.\u201d\u201cBrat, are you speaking to me?\u201d Wang QiShan was already at the edge of exploding.Liu Meng was frightened by this aura to the point that he did not dare to speak.However, Zhang Han on the other hand, stood up and walked to the front of the office table and grabbed away the contract from Wang QiShan\u2019s hand, then stared at Wang QiShan for a while, then said,\u201cYou dropped your underpants.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Wang QiShan pointing at Zhang Han with his finger that was trembling.Wang QiShan had already been accustomed to being in a high position and having almost everyone who met him to always be respectful towards him. Where has he ever had a squabble with someone before? Right now, he was angry to the point that he did not even know what to say.\u201cTo not even able to understand words\u2026how did you even manage to become the director?\u201d Zhang Han shook his head and sigh, then pointed to the floor where Wang QiShan\u2019s legs were stepping on,\u201cI said that you underpants had dropped on the floor. You are already an adult, how can you be that careless? Even if you had the hobby of collecting other\u2019s underpants when you are having a love affair, you also have to keep it properly right? To negligently drop it on the ground, if it was to be seen by others, your reputation as \u2018director\u2019 will most likely be gone.\u201dHearing that, Wang QiShan hurriedly lowered his head to take a look. When he discovered the lace underpants that was right beside his foot, his face immediately became bright red, and within his gaze that was looking towards Zhang Han, there was somewhat of a panic in it.\u201cThis contract of mine, has it been signed finish?\u201dZhang Han lightly smiled. This Wang QiShan was able to become a director with this kind of mental quality? It was reckoned that this Wang QiShan most likely entered through the back door.\u201cIt has been signed finish.\u201d Wang QiShan replied sub-consciously.After hearing that, Zhang Han took the contract and left. Not even turning his head back at all while leaving.And as for Liu Meng, he had his head lowered down all this time, as if he was trying to say, \u2018I did not see anything at all. I did not hear anything at all\u2019 as he closely followed after Zhang Han and left Director Wang\u2019s office.\u201cMr Zhang, your\u2026your guts is just too big already.\u201d Liu Meng said with a bitter smile, \u201cIf you had not discovered the underpants, I reckoned that the contract would have fallen into ruins today. But even if that was the case, after Director Wang regained his composure, with his petty character, he would most likely make things difficult for you.\u201d\u201cMake things difficult for me?\u201dZhang Han\u2019s expression was calm as he said lightly, \u201cLet him come and make things difficult for me then.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201dLiu Meng helplessly sighed. He had felt an uncommon aura from Zhang Han and felt that Zhang Han was not afraid of Director Wang at all. Therefore, he felt that Zhang Han should more or less have some social connections. But to rent the Crescent Mountain after offending Director Wang, Zhang Han had already stood on the disadvantaged side.If Zhang Han knew Liu Meng\u2019s thoughts, it was reckoned that Zhang Han would sneer endlessly.How would he, the grand Han Yang Immortal Monarch, be afraid of a mere Director Wang?Liu Meng saw Zhang Han off all the way to the main entrance. Before Zhang Han entered the car, Liu Meng smiled and said, \u201cMr Zhang, from now on, Crescent Mountain will belong to you for a year. You can plant things on the mountain, but the guarding of the things that you planted on the mountain will have to be taken care of yourself. After all, there are quite a few mountain climbers who like to go to Crescent Mountain.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head.Zhang Han was after all not a rash youngster. He did not straight away rush to the Crescent Mountain which he just rented so that he could quickly reconstruct Crescent Mountain and instead first went to the restaurant which was undergoing renovation.Before he had even reached the restaurant, from far away, he saw that there was two truck outside of the restaurant that was currently loading some goods.When he walked into the restaurant, Zhao Kai immediately came up to Zhang Han and welcomed him passionately.The restaurant had already been tear apart by the workers. The first floor became a spacious living room, while not really much changes were made to the second floor. The things that should have been tear down had already been tear down. At the second floor, there was currently 5 people renovating the restaurant.Seems like, in order to finish the renovation within a work, the amount of manpower used was indeed quite a lot.At the first floor, 8 workers were renovating the restaurant. Zhang Han stood at the side and watched quietly.AT the east side, a skilled worker was currently carving a jadeite for the television wall. At the west side, some workers were beginning to spread the floor tiles and the brick wall for the kitchen.The number of ceramic tiles needed and places that needed to be cut were all settled during the day. When night came, a new batch of workers swap with the batch of workers who were renovating the restaurant during the day.Renovating all the day from day to night, the speed of the renovation was of course naturally very fast.All the way until midnight 3am+, Zhang Han then stood up and left.\u201cIt is time!\u201dSitting within the Jeep, Zhang Han\u2019s gaze looked towards the direction of Crescent Mountain, as a smile hanged in the corner of his mouth.The speed of the car was very fast. Within 10minutes, Zhang Han had already reached Crescent Mountain. After walking 20minutes, Zhang Han reached the mountaintop.Under the bright moonlight, Crescent Mountain was hazy and very quiet. Zhang Han\u2019s gaze examined his surroundings for one last time.In his heart, he already had a meticulous idea of how he wants to reconstruct the mountain.\u201cLet\u2019s begin!\u201dZhang Han took a deep breath, then take out jade color needle-like Thunder-Yang Tree from within his ear and straightaway pricked it into his vein. When the Thunder-Yang Tree was pricked into his vein, it started absorbing his blood. After losing a huge amount of blood, Zhang Han\u2019s complexion became incredibly pale, but deep within Zhang Han\u2019s eyes, it was still calm and unstartled.After the Thunder-Yang Tree absorbed enough blood, Zhang Han felt that his connection with the Thunder-Yang Tree became much deeper. Hence, he plucked out the jade color Thunder-Yang Tree from his veins.\u201cGo!\u201dZhang Han flung his fingers and the needle-like Thunder-Yang Tree got thrown into the ground below his feet.\u201cRumbling!\u201dThe entire Crescent Mountain began trembling!The trembling was so loud that even the people that were at Crescent Gulf were able to hear a low trembling sound!\u201cFuse!\u201dZhang Han closed his eyes. From under his feet, strands of mild color light continuously float upwards and converged at Zhang Han\u2019s head.Currently, Zhang Han\u2019s consciousness was fused together with Thunder-Yang Tree. After processing through Zhang Han\u2019s thoughts, Thunder-Yang Tree began to operate.Above the ground, not a trace of billows could be seen. But within the ground, the jade color needle-like Thunder-Yang Tree was quietly undergoing a drastic change.If someone was able to see what was happening, they would be able to see that the jade color of the Thunder-Yang Tree faded away and changed into an ash-brown color which a tree would normally possess. After that, tree roots which were just like strands of hair began to spread outward.Gradually, the hair-like tree roots grown as thick as a finger, then grown into as thick as an arm, then finally grown into as thick as a bucket. Meanwhile, the diameter of the Thunder-Yang Tree began 3meters!The tree roots continuously invaded and occupied Crescent Mountain. All the way until it occupied the entire land of the Crescent Mountain, the Thunder-Yang Tree then started growing upwards!\u201cCrack\u2026crack\u2026\u201dThe Thunder-Yang Tree which had a diameter of 3 meters broke out through the ground in front of Zhang Han.Merely within 5 seconds, the Thunder-Yang Tree\u2019s height grown up to 30meters!After another 5 seconds, the branches of Thunder-Yang Tree began to spread outwards, just like a flower that was blooming!Very quickly, the main body of Thunder-Yang Tree finished growing. If one was to stand from far away, they would be able to see that this Thunder-Yang Tree was situated at the mountaintop of Crescent Mountain, seemingly just like a World Tree from within a game!Liked it?

However, right now, the reconstruction of the domain has only just begun!At the center of Crescent Mountain, within a narrow space, there was a small pond of spiritual water, which Zhang Han needed.Thus, the tree roots of Thunder-Yang Tree trembled continuously, seemingly just like an octopus brandishing its tentacles.The tree roots directly moved the narrow space to right below the Thunder-Yang Tree. As for the other tree roots, they were sweeping and trembling within the underground, seemingly just like they were opening up tunnels. Not long after, within the inside of Crescent Mountain, a winding corridor shape space was built.\u201cSuck in!\u201dA branch of the Thunder-Yang Tree plunged into the spiritual water and absorbed all of the spiritual water.In the next moment, the tree roots that were within the winding corridor shape cave suddenly released out water.Those water, all of it were spiritual water! In a moment, the entire winding corridor shape cave was filled with spiritual water. And right below the Thunder-Yang Tree, at the tree roots part, drips of water were slowly dripping downwards. The water droplets had a milky white color and were sparkling and translucent.This water was rank 1 spiritual treasure, Pure-Yang Water!\u201cRaise!\u201dZhang Han\u2019s mouth lightly spat out a word.Immediately, Thunder-Yang Tree began to operate. At the mountaintop of Crescent Mountain, all of the precipitous terrains swelled upward. After smoothening out to a moderate level, then did the change stop.At the surroundings of Crescent Mountain, the ground started trembling, at the 3 sides of the mountain, the ground terrain started to rise upwards, forming a small scale steep cliff which was 3 meters tall.At the direction towards Crescent Gulf, the road there did not change at all.The reason why Zhang Han made those small-scale steep cliff was to prevent other people from coming to Crescent Mountain!Crescent Mountain has already been occupied by me and you people still want to come here to climb mountain? Go to other places instead!The exterior appearance reconstruction had been finished. Right now, all that was left were the specific details.Zhang Han pressed his palm onto Thunder-Yang Tree and closed his eyes. He was able to feel and sense everything that was within Crescent Mountain.A grass, a wood, a granule, a stone, all of it were within his mind.The current situation of Crescent Mountain right now was that there were a lot of trees and very little space.But this was a small later. Zhang Han used his own consciousness to connect to Thunder-Yang Tree\u2019s energy and began another part of the reconstruction.In the middle of Crescent Mountain, the ground rolled continuously and the trees began to move outwards in all directions.In a moment, a large vacant space appeared in the middle of Crescent Mountain, while the trees were all situated all around the large vacant space, seemingly just like a perimeter wall that was formed around the large vacant space. The trees were densely packed together, especially the side that was near the road, where trees stood in great numbers, seemingly just like a city wall.At the 3 other sides of Crescent Mountain, the gap of each trees was also very short, and furthermore, under Zhang Han\u2019s control, the branches of all the different trees extended downwards, forming a big net. Therefore, even if someone was to climb over the 3 meters tall steep cliff, when faced against those messy and hard branches, even if they wanted to climb up to the mountaintop of Crescent Mountain, they would also have to spend a large amount of time.In addition, normally when trees were assembled at the edge of a mountain and were crowded together, it was disadvantageous for the trees to grow. But at Crescent Mountain, under the nourishment of spiritual soil, there was no disadvantageous for the trees to grow at all. Even if the trees were all packed too closely, it wouldn\u2019t even matter too.But, if the trees were all packed too closely together, the aesthetic of it would be somewhat unpleasing to the eyes.If this kind of transformation was to be seen by someone else, they would surely shout out load that a miracle was happening in front of their eyes.Although no human was able to see it, a dog was able to see it.It was the Chinese rural dog that had come into contact with Zhang Han once.Seeing that the trees there were around him continuously moving around, the dog had already been frightened dumb and was shivering its body as it stood on the ground.After a while, the moving of the trees stopped and the dog that was standing on the ground saw Zhang Han who was below the huge tree that was situated at the mountaintop.\u201cIt is him?\u201dThe doggy\u2019s memory was very good. With just a look, it recognized Zhang Han. After mustering up its courage, the dog quietly walked towards Zhang Han.After walking up to the point that it was approximately 10 meters away from Zhang Han, it sat on the ground at looked at Zhang Han curiously.Towards the arrival of the doggy, Zhang Han was naturally well aware. However, he did not bother about the dog and continued reconstructing Crescent Mountain.Right now, all that was left was to make the areas.At Crescent Mountain, there was not only tall trees, there was also quite a few flowers and plants. There was even a few hollies that was normally used for the purpose of making fence at city neighborhood.Within cities, holly was commonly seen. Sometimes, holly was even able to seen at the roadside. The growth of holly was somewhat tiny, with a height growth of about 1 meter. The holly that could be seen within cities were normally trimmed nicely, and was a nice sight to look at.Upon seeing the holly, Zhang Han decided to use holly to separate out each different area.However\u2026the amount of holly was just too little!No problem!Using the energy that the Thunder-Yang Tree released out right now as it occupied the land, transplanting the holly and making it grow was just a matter of a blink of an eye.\u201cRaise!\u201dZhang Han lightly said.Immediately, all of the weeds that were growing on the ground were all plucked out and blew away by the cold breeze. Within a few breathes, all of the weeds were cleaned out.\u201cPlant!\u201dThe few hollies flew into the sky, then fell into the different spots that Zhang Han wanted to it be planted at. The holly grew out one by one, just like dominoes, spreading outwards in all of the different areas, forming 3 big areas at the back of the mountain.At the direction that Zhang Han was facing against, the left side was the planting area, the middle was the poultry area, and the right side was the pet area.All of the flowers that were at the back of the mountain, like the Chinese redbuds, few roses, moutan peony, frangipanis that were a cross between yellow and white, and so on other flowers, were all moved to the left area of the front of the mountain.The was a limit to the Thunder-Yang Tree\u2019s energy, therefore, Zhang Han could only first reconstruct the back of the mountain for the first reconstruction. As for the front of the mountain, that would have to wait for the second reconstruction.Originally, the second reconstruction would need 2 to 3 year time. But with the nourishment of Pure-Yang Water, the amount time would be reduced. Furthermore, the Thunder-Yang Wood did not need 5 years that long amount of time to grow.Towards Zhang Han, this was indeed an extremely good news.\u201cSweet scent grass!\u201dZhang Han palm was still pressed onto Thunder-Yang Tree, as he lightly said out 3 words.Immediately, from within the leaves of the Thunder-Yang Tree, seeds of sweet scent grass were sprinkled out. Apart from the planting area, the seeds of sweet scent grass were sprinkled out to everywhere else.Sweet scent grass was a very common grass in the Cultivation World. Its growth was not big, and was able to grow to become just like the lawn of a football field. As its name implies, the main thing it could do was release out a sweet scent, which could help improve the air of a domain. Its use was equivalent to an air purifier!Sweet scent grass could not even be counted as a rank 1 spiritual treasure. But back then, Zhang Han would still always store some sweet scent grass seeds within Thunder-Yang Tree, for the use of planting it every time when he changed a domain.Evidently, the use of sweet scent grass right now was quite useful.After finish planting sweet scent grass, Zhang Han planted Yuanqing Tree 10 meters away from Thunder-Yang Tree, then used holly to surround around the Yuanqing Tree.Right now, Yuanqing Tree was still a small tree, just like a small poplar tree. According to its growth speed, it was reckoned that within a year, it would be able to grow out Yuanqing Fruit. When that time comes, Zhang Han would be able to refine Yuan Cultivation Pill and reach the Foundation Establishment Realm.At Foundation Establishment Realm, Zhang Han would be able to release out spiritual strength from his body and use some small abilities. When that time comes, it would also mean that Zhang Han was able to stand firmly at Earth.\u201cThat\u2019s right, heaven fragrant wood also have to be planted.\u201dThus, Zhang Han used holly to make a small circle right beside Yuanqing Tree and placed heaven fragrant wood within the circle.Heaven fragrant wood was a tree trunk. The usefulness of heaven fragrant wood could be either said to be big or small.For its usefulness to be small, it was because that heaven fragrant wood could only be used when cooking food, and for its usefulness to be big, it was because that the food that was made with the used of heaven fragrant wood was indeed very fragrant!After finishing settling those things, it was time to subdivide the 3 areas.\u201cThe planting area will temporarily be split into crop area and orchard area. The few fruit tree saplings that I have collected cannot be planted currently. The amount of energy those few fruit tree saplings need to absorbs is just too much already. I will preserve this area first then.\u201dAfter Zhang Han pondered, the holly grew once again and split the planting area into 2.\u201cWhat should I plant in the crop area? There are rice, wheat, corn, soybean, broad bean and so on other things\u2026I will consider planting rice and wheat first for now.\u201dThe Thunder-Yang Tree operated once again. At the back area of the planting area, the soil started protruding upwards, forming a piece of rice field.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I have to make a vegetable area too.\u201dThe holly grew once again, separating out a vegetable area in the planting area.There were much more choices for what vegetables to grow. The lowest minimal was to let Meng Meng eat all different kind of vegetables. For the vegetables that were grown in Crescent Mountain, there was no such thing as being picky because all the vegetables would definitely taste good.\u201cNutrition must be balanced!\u201dZhang Han was very satisfied with the areas he split apart in the planting area.The next was the poultry area.\u201cThere needs to be a pond to use for raising fish. In addition, Meng Meng has to drink milk, eat chicken meat, duck meat, fish meat, goat meat and so on other things. Let\u2019s split into a small, middle and big body type poultry areas then.\u201dFollowed by Zhang Han\u2019s thoughts, the holly began growing once again and split the poultry area into different areas.Within the most inner side of the poultry area, the ground of the pond area concaved downwards, forming a pond that was 5 meters deep. At the poultry area, a separate 3 meters deep small pond was able made for the poultry and cattle to drink water and swim at.\u201cFor the pet area, I can only consider some adorable dogs and cats right now, which are able to accompany Meng Meng play. For tigers and lions, those can be set aside for now. I will first make a pond in the pet area.\u201dFor the pet area, it was much simpler. All there was to do was to make a long rectangular pond.After subdividing finish, a trace of satisfaction flashed across Zhang Han\u2019s face.Although it was not the best, it could only be like this for now.\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, I still have to build house for them to be protected from the rain.\u201dZhang Han almost forgot about this matter. The energy of the Thunder-Yang Tree was used once again. The tall trees that were in the distant flew into the air one by one. While it was flying, the trees were shaved and became a plank.Planks after planks landed onto each different areas and formed into a few different houses.The house of the chickens was a chicken coop, where it was half a meter high away from the ground. The weeds that were swept away by the breeze, some of it flew back and was placed into each of the chicken coops. With weeds, the chickens would be able to make its own nest.The ducks, gooses and other animals all have their own houses. Those houses were all situated near the edge of the forest, seemingly somewhat neat. Of course, the dogs and cats have their own houses too. The row of houses was just like a bunch of personal small villas\u201cAlthough it does look neat, the aesthetic doesn\u2019t seem to be enough.\u201d Zhang Han muttered to himself.Using his own conscious to control the Thunder-Yang Tree\u2019s energy again, a bunch of green leaves covered the top of all the small houses, seemingly just like houses which were piled up by leaves. The use of the leaves was not only for aesthetic, but it was also able to prevent the rain from soaking the wood below.\u201cThis time\u2019s reconstruction is more or less finished.\u201dZhang Han smiled slightly, then took a deep breath.\u201cLet\u2019s begin!\u201dThe Thunder-Yang Tree emitted out a deep noise and half of the spiritual water within the mountain cave was absorbed by Thunder-Yang Tree.On the leaves of the Thunder-Yang Tree, droplets of water enveloped the entire Crescent Mountain.Seemingly just like a light rainfall. The energy of Thunder-Yang Tree cleansed Crescent Mountain one time after another time, all the way until the soil transformed into spiritual soil.At the ground of Crescent Mountain, sweet scent grass broke out through the ground. Apart from the planting area, the rest of Crescent Mountain was covered by an entire sheet of green color.In a moment, Crescent Mountain was brimming with full of vitality!Advanced to Qi Refining RealmAt the front of the mountain, flowers after flowers withered down very quickly. But afterward, just like a phoenix being rebirth, those flowers were rebirth. After blossoming once again, the color of those flowers was much more penetrating and the shape of the petals of the flowers was much more perfect looking. Compared to before, the flowers right now could be said to have practically transformed into the king of flowers.The bunch of flowers were gorgeous and pulled onto the heart of others, while at the same time attracting the gaze from others.\u201cOnly left with meat grass now.\u201dZhang Han\u2019s consciousness moved. At the tree trunk of Thunder-Yang Tree, a bunch of meat grass seeds flew whistling towards the poultry area and pet area.The meat grass seeds landed on the inner side of both of the areas. As soon as the seeds were seeded into the ground, within after 2 seconds, they germinated out of the ground, then 5 seconds later, a white color bud that was as big as a glass sphere was formed on the top of each of the meat grass.Looking from afar, the meat grass looked just like the enlarged form of the ear of wheat.Meat grass belonged to rank 1 spiritual treasure. The purpose of meat grass was to be used as the fodder of animals. When eating it, there would be a vegetable kind of fragrant. But when chewing it, it tasted like meat. After chewing for a bit, the taste somewhat tasted like red braised pork.This was also known by Zhang Han because of him tasting the meat grass out of curiosity. However, Zhang Han also only took a bite. After all, meat grass was a fodder. Just knowing how it tasted like was enough.After finishing with the meat grass, the first transformation of the land had also come to an end.However, from the total amount of energy that the Thunder-Yang Tree could release for the first time, there was still half of it left. Of course, those energy were for Zhang Han to promote to Qi Refining Realm.\u201cOpen meridians!\u201dZhang Han tightly closed his eyes as he moved his right hand away from the Thunder-Yang Tree, then raised both of his hands up high.At this time, the rural dog which was at one side was looking at Zhang Han confusedly.If it was able to speak, it would definitely say:\u201cWhat is this stupid person doing?\u201dHowever, it did not have the high level of thought process of a human after all, thus it was only confusedly looking at Zhang Han.However, the image at the next moment scared the rural dog, causing it to quiver from its head to foot.It was seen that the Thunder-Yang Tree suddenly emitted out a faint serene light. At this moment, every piece of leaf was just like jadeite. Strands of gentle multicolored light continuously gathered together, then formed into a light beam in the end as it shot towards Zhang Han and entered into Zhang Han\u2019s body.\u201cRumbling!\u201dZhang Han felt as if he heard the sound of thunder. Within Zhang Han\u2019s body, the energy of the Thunder-Yang Tree transformed into a sharp sword and continuously opened access to one meridian after another.In wuxia novels, eight extraordinary meridians were paid particular attention to. People who were able to open all eight extraordinary meridians were counted as a genius.But right now, after Zhang Han opened up all the eight extraordinary meridians, the rest of the energy was beginning to continuously strengthen the twelve meridians of the human body.(Eight extraordinary meridians are supposed to be hidden from the normal human body and the twelve meridians seem to be the meridians which connect from the hand to feet. The twelve meridians flow in a full circle.)The eight extraordinary meridians did not directly subordinate to the inner organs and also did not have a content list to match with, thus was thereby called extraordinary. The use of the eight extraordinary meridians was its function of being able to revolve qi and blood circulation and adjusting of the twelve meridians.After the meridians were opened, the strands of energy of the Thunder-Yang Tree gathered into the meridians.At the start, the energy was frantic, causing Zhang Han to feel as if his body was going to burst.At this time, what Zhang Han needed to do was to revolve the cultivation technique and refine all those energy, turning all those energy into his own spiritual strength!\u201cShould I still cultivate Treasure Hunting Technique this time?\u201dZhang Han muttered.In his previous life, he had countless treasures and relied too much on treasures. Thus later on, during time for the Heavenly Tribulation, he was not able to withstand the attack from the Nine Heaven God Thunder!Right now, Zhang Han was hesitating.\u201cOr not, how about I cultivate Five Phase Technique? In the future, after I finish cultivating into Five Phase Sage Body, I suppose that I would be able to smoothly overcome the Nine Heaven God Thunder right?\u201d\u201cActually, Green Wood Monarch Technique is okay too. The recovery strength of Green Wood Monarch Body is much more frightening and is known as the undying body. It would definitely be able to overcome the Nine Heaven God Thunder.\u201dZhang Han was somewhat hesitant.Cultivation technique was very important, as it concerned one\u2019s strength growth. In the big Cultivation World, cultivation techniques were split into ranks of 3, 6 and 9. Treasure Hunting Technique was a cultivation technique which Zhang Han created after he had researched about cultivation for 300years and got a sudden moment of enlightenment.The use of Treasure Hunting Technique was not small at all. It was even the main reason that Zhang Han was able to get X amount of treasures.For example, Treasure Hunting Technique was able to power-up Concealing Technique. The Concealing Technique that was power-up afterward was known as God Concealing Technique. Not only was God Concealing Technique able to let Zhang Han\u2019s body become completely concealed, it was even able to cause mighty experts in the Tribulation Realm to not be able to detect Zhang Han.The effect of Treasure Hunting Technique was that it was able to power-up other techniques that were used for treasure hunting, like for example, speed, breaking formations, concealing and so on. However, Treasure Hunting Technique\u2019s biggest effect was that it was able to power-up Treasure Smelling Nose, which was also the reason why Zhang Han did not want to give up on cultivating Treasure Hunting Technique.\u201cForget it, I should just cultivate Treasure Hunting Technique. It could be said that I am starting all over again this time. Worst come to worst, I could just spend a bit more resources to attain Sage Corporeal Body. Treasures are still after all the fundamental for cultivating!\u201dAfter hesitating for up to less than a minute, Zhang Han made up his mind.Sat down cross-legged, Zhang Han started revolving Treasure Hunting Technique. The energy within Zhang Han\u2019s body was slowly being refined and beginning to go in a cycle according to Treasure Hunting Technique\u2019s directions.At this current moment, a smear of morning sun slowly raised up from the east, while a human and a dog were quietly sitting under Thunder-Yang Tree, revealing a warm image.\u2026\u2026At Yunyin Garden, within Zi Yan\u2019s house.\u201cBig sister Yan, are we going to work? It is only 7 am right now.\u201d Zhou Fei yawned.Normally, she would sleep until 8 am.\u201cLet\u2019s go to work earlier today and pick finish the songs. Tomorrow we will accompany Meng Meng to Ocean Park to play for a day.\u201d Zi Yan said calmly.\u201cYou can leave me out. I will be at the company tomorrow planning out the music videos according to the songs.\u201d Zhou Fei shook her head.\u201cYou are not going?\u201d Zi Yan was slightly dazed.\u201cI go for what? To be a light bulb? I am not going to come along with you family of three.\u201d Zhou Fei said petulantly.\u201cWho is a family of three?\u201d Zi Yan lightly spat. (Not literally spitting, just a simple light gesture.)\u201cTsk, big sister Yan, it is not that I am saying nonsense, just take a look at you right now, continuingly saying Meng Meng, Meng Meng, Meng Meng. Meng Meng was the name that that fellow thought out. Also, yesterday when that fellow said to go Ocean Park, you didn\u2019t even reject all and had a total look of a wife who was obedient to all of her husband\u2019s requests. Those few years when we were at North America, you have never been like this.\u201d Zhou Fei pouted her mouth and said.\u201cDon\u2019t anyhow speak nonsense!\u201d Zi Yan glared at Zhou Fei.Zhou Fei was well-behaved this time and did not continue speaking.After coming downstairs, they entered black color Mercedes-Benz S600L. The total cost of this car was close to 3million rmb. It was the car that Zi Yan used when she was working. Most of the time, Zhou Fei would be the one driving.Sitting at the back of the car, Zi Yan\u2019s gaze was looking outside the window, seemingly somewhat absent-minded.A family of three going to Ocean Park huh\u2026\u2026Just what is my attitude towards Zhang Han?In the beginning, Zi Yan thought that her heart treated Zhang Han as a total passer-by. However, the fact was that it wasn\u2019t the case!It seems that, when facing against Zhang Han, she who was always tranquil and even-tempered would always not able to remain calm. All of Zhang Han\u2019s words and actions did indeed had some influence on Zi Yan.\u201cPerhaps it is because of Meng Meng\u2026\u2026\u201dZi Yan lightly sighed in her heart.Only this kind of explanation was able to convince her. Because Zhang Han was Meng Meng\u2019s father, therefore she was not able to be indifferent towards him.\u201cThis is definitely not romance.\u201dThe romance in Zi Yan\u2019s heart was not like this. No matter which women, all of them would have a perfect prince charming in their heart.The prince charming in Zi Yan\u2019s heart was much more inclined to someone who was multi-talented, elegant, refined in manner, possesses both talent and virtue, and also have a passable appearance.It was not someone like Zhang Han this down and out big young master who has a bad temper and also thought that my performing career was\u2026what was that again that he said?\u2018A mere celebrity on the TV screen, it is nothing but an actor that could be casually invited with money.\u201dWhat kind of words were those? Just thinking about it was enough to make Zi Yan become angry. Especially when they were fighting, that fellow even said, \u2018if you want to stay in this messy entertainment industry, it is impossible for me to be together with you\u2019.Please, when did I said that I wanted to be together with you? Who would ever like a rigid brain who has a bad temper?Zhang Han\u2019s figure flashed pass Zi Yan\u2019s mind, and as she recalled of those words, in a moment, an obscure flame of anger raised up in her heart!\u201cBig sister Yan? Big sister Yan?\u201dZi Yan only reacted after Zhou Fei called out to her a couple of times.\u201cAh?\u201d Zi Yan was in a daze.\u201cWhat were you thinking about? We have reached the company already!\u201d Zhou Fei said speechlessly.\u201cOh, let\u2019s go then.\u201d\u201cI am not going to think of that rigid brain, time to go to work!\u201d Zi Yan thought to herself in her heart.\u2026\u2026The sun gradually raised, and people left their home in succession to begin their either busy or leisure day.As for Zhang Han, he sat under the Thunder-Yang Tree for an entire day.All the way until it the sky gradually became dark, Zhang Han then finally turned those energy into his own and advanced to Qi Refining Realm.And during this day, that Chinese rural dog was running back and forth around the Crescent Mountain which was now just like a public square. It strolled around at each of the different areas, ate the meat grass which just grown out not long ago and walked around every doghouse in a circle for a few times as it wagged its tail back and forth excitedly.Under Thunder-Yang Tree, when Zhang Han opened both of his eyes, a trace of radiance flashed across his eyes.As he stood up, the bones in his entire body started making cracking sounds. At this moment, he had been reborn!Although it was only the Qi Refining Realm, but Zhang Han had the strength of easily close to 500kg. Also, when using spiritual qi, his speed would become very fast, becoming able to immediately surpass those famous sprinters or long distance runners.Although Zhang Han had this kind of strength, he would not compete against them. Cough, cough, be low-profile. There would be no pleasure in striving over victory with a bunch of insects!\u201cWoof, woof, woof\u2026\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the sound of the barking of a dog could be heard.Zhang Han\u2019s gaze congealed as he said in a deep tone:\u201cWhich insect dare to bark in front of me?\u201dTurning his head over, Zhang Han saw the Chinese rural dog who wanted to save him back then was barking behind him.\u201cHaha, so it is you!\u201d Zhang Han smiled faintly.He had known that it was this dog from the start. Those words that he spoke just now were merely but a joke he made to celebrate himself \u2018entering into cultivating for the first time\u2019.\u201cWoof, woof.\u201dThe Chinese rural dog went up to Zhang Han\u2019s foot, displaying a boot-licking image.Zhang Han looked at the dog and muttered to himself, then shook his head and said, \u201cForget about it, you had a kind heart towards me, and also have fate with me. From now on, you will be my domain\u2019s little housekeeper who helps me look after and protect the domain!\u201dZhang Han\u2019s words had decided that this dog would become very capable in the future.\u201cNever thought that Pure-Yang Water would be used by you this little fellow first.\u201d Zhang Han shook his head, then stretched out his hand and touched the Thunder-Yang Tree. Suddenly, Zhang Han expression paused for a moment, followed by him laughing out involuntarily, \u201cYour luck sure is good!\u201dAfter a day had passed, Thunder-Yang Tree would soon enter into silent, which meant that it would not be able to release out energy anymore. However, \u2018soon\u2019 means that Thunder-Yang Tree still had not yet entered into silent yet!\u201cHousekeeper\u2026seems like I will have to use up some capital.\u201dZhang Han lightly took in a breath, then pressed both his hands onto the Thunder-Yang Tree. Spiritual strength continuously gathered within Thunder-Yang Tree.Suddenly, a strand of white crystal water droplets floated out from Thunder-Yang Tree. The water droplets were like a string of necklace, floating towards the forehead of the Chinese rural dog. When the water droplets reached the dog\u2019s forehead, the water droplets turned into dots of starlight as it entered into the dog\u2019s forehead.Liked it?

Especially when they were fighting, that fellow even said, \u2018if you want to stay in this messy entertainment industry, it is impossible for me to be together with you\u2019.Please, when did I said that I wanted to be together with you? Who would ever like a rigid brain who has a bad temper?Zhang Han\u2019s figure flashed pass Zi Yan\u2019s mind, and as she recalled of those words, in a moment, an obscure flame of anger raised up in her heart!\u201cBig sister Yan? Big sister Yan?\u201dZi Yan only reacted after Zhou Fei called out to her a couple of times.\u201cAh?\u201d Zi Yan was in a daze.\u201cWhat were you thinking about? We have reached the company already!\u201d Zhou Fei said speechlessly.\u201cOh, let\u2019s go then.\u201d\u201cI am not going to think of that rigid brain, time to go to work!\u201d Zi Yan thought to herself in her heart.\u2026\u2026The sun gradually raised, and people left their home in succession to begin their either busy or leisure day.As for Zhang Han, he sat under the Thunder-Yang Tree for an entire day.All the way until it the sky gradually became dark, Zhang Han then finally turned those energy into his own and advanced to Qi Refining Realm.And during this day, that Chinese rural dog was running back and forth around the Crescent Mountain which was now just like a public square. It strolled around at each of the different areas, ate the meat grass which just grown out not long ago and walked around every doghouse in a circle for a few times as it wagged its tail back and forth excitedly.Under Thunder-Yang Tree, when Zhang Han opened both of his eyes, a trace of radiance flashed across his eyes.As he stood up, the bones in his entire body started making cracking sounds. At this moment, he had been reborn!Although it was only the Qi Refining Realm, but Zhang Han had the strength of easily close to 500kg. Also, when using spiritual qi, his speed would become very fast, becoming able to immediately surpass those famous sprinters or long distance runners.Although Zhang Han had this kind of strength, he would not compete against them. Cough, cough, be low-profile. There would be no pleasure in striving over victory with a bunch of insects!\u201cWoof, woof, woof\u2026\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the sound of the barking of a dog could be heard.Zhang Han\u2019s gaze congealed as he said in a deep tone:\u201cWhich insect dare to bark in front of me?\u201dTurning his head over, Zhang Han saw the Chinese rural dog who wanted to save him back then was barking behind him.\u201cHaha, so it is you!\u201d Zhang Han smiled faintly.He had known that it was this dog from the start. Those words that he spoke just now were merely but a joke he made to celebrate himself \u2018entering into cultivating for the first time\u2019.\u201cWoof, woof.\u201dThe Chinese rural dog went up to Zhang Han\u2019s foot, displaying a boot-licking image.Zhang Han looked at the dog and muttered to himself, then shook his head and said, \u201cForget about it, you had a kind heart towards me, and also have fate with me. From now on, you will be my domain\u2019s little housekeeper who helps me look after and protect the domain!\u201dZhang Han\u2019s words had decided that this dog would become very capable in the future.\u201cNever thought that Pure-Yang Water would be used by you this little fellow first.\u201d Zhang Han shook his head, then stretched out his hand and touched the Thunder-Yang Tree. Suddenly, Zhang Han expression paused for a moment, followed by him laughing out involuntarily, \u201cYour luck sure is good!\u201dAfter a day had passed, Thunder-Yang Tree would soon enter into silent, which meant that it would not be able to release out energy anymore. However, \u2018soon\u2019 means that Thunder-Yang Tree still had not yet entered into silent yet!\u201cHousekeeper\u2026seems like I will have to use up some capital.\u201dZhang Han lightly took in a breath, then pressed both his hands onto the Thunder-Yang Tree. Spiritual strength continuously gathered within Thunder-Yang Tree.Suddenly, a strand of white crystal water droplets floated out from Thunder-Yang Tree. The water droplets were like a string of necklace, floating towards the forehead of the Chinese rural dog. When the water droplets reached the dog\u2019s forehead, the water droplets turned into dots of starlight as it entered into the dog\u2019s forehead.Liked it?

    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 - Steward Xiao HeiPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euUnder the nourishment of the Pure-Yang Water, the broken bone of the dog\u2019s back leg was slowly reconstructing back together! At this moment, the dog felt immeasurably refreshing and pleasurable, as it closed its eyes pleasingly.However, if the dog wanted to upgrade its essence, it still needed to suffer a great amount of pain!\u201cOrigin!\u201dA light flickered in Zhang Han\u2019s eyes.\u201cBang!\u201dA thundering sound rang out, and a green color lightning could be seen being shot out from within Thunder-Yang Tree.This was the Thunder-Yang Tree\u2019s strength of origin. Although there was only a trace, do not forget that Thunder-Yang Tree was a rank 5 spiritual treasure!What was the concept of rank 5 spiritual treasure? Even a rank 1 spiritual treasure True-Yang Water was able to recover the dog\u2019s broken leg, so what about a rank 5 spiritual treasure? It must be known that, every increasing rank of a spiritual treasure was not a matter of being 2x or 3x stronger than the previous rank that simple!Just thinking about that alone, it could be seen just how scary rank 5 spiritual treasure was!The green color lightning entered into the dog\u2019s body in an instant!Causing the dog to go \u2018awoo\u2019, then followed by the twitching of the dog\u2019s body.It was truly a moment heaven and the next moment hell.\u201cThe transformation of essence is very difficult. I hope you will be able to persevere.\u201dZhang Han lowered his head and looked at the Chinese rural dog. Zhang Han was also not sure if the dog would be able to persevere on.If it was able to persevere on, it would be able to be reborn anew. But if it was not able to persevere on, then perhaps its life would come to an end!The heavenly law was fair. If one wanted to be out of the ordinary, then they must endure pain that was out of the ordinary!The number of cultivators that had a smooth and steady journey like Zhang Han was very little. Also, even when Zhang Han\u2019s growth was relatively fast, in the end, didn\u2019t he still attracted the Ninth Heaven God Thunder which was rarely seen even once in ten thousand years?Back to the Chinese rural dog. After being struck by the green lightning, its entire body starting trembling, and even its eyes also rolled backward.The dog\u2019s tooth trembled unceasingly, letting out a bunch of crackling sounds.After trembling for less than 5 seconds, all of its teeth started falling off, the somewhat filthy hair all started falling off strand after strand, in the end revealing out the dog\u2019s delicate skin.The dog\u2019s bones could be heard crackling continuously, as if firecracker was being set off within the dog\u2019s body.The dog\u2019s body which was the same size as a Samoyed dog was continuously growing bigger.It seemed slow, but it was actually very fast. Only a minute had passed and the doggy\u2019s body size had already become the size of a fully grown Tibetan Mastiff.Speaking from direct observation, its height was 1meter+ tall. When it stood up, it could easily reach Zhang Han\u2019s shoulder, and Zhang Han\u2019s height was 1.8meter!The dog\u2019s four legs were very thick too. Its body seemed just like an enlarged version of how it was a few moments ago before it was struck by the green lightning. At the same time, the teeth in its mouth all started growing back out. It opened its mouth and started panting in pain. From the small cracks of its mouth, its sharp fangs could be seen!Those teeth were most probably the kind of teeth that was able to chew through any food and even be hired for a toothpaste commercial.Very quickly, the dog\u2019s hair all started growing back out. The hair was the same color as of how it was before, but there was, however, a change in the essence already.The black color hair on the dog\u2019s body was just like ink, incomparably pitch-black. The length of the hair was also two times longer than it was before. The few gold color hair on the dog also became as resplendent as gold. Before, it was gold-white color, but right now it was pure gold color.The hair in the inner side of its ears, in the inner corner of the brows above its eyes, the lower part of its face, chin, two small regions under its stomach, and the lower half of all of its legs were all gold color.Its claws were still black in color. The intertwining of black and gold color gave the dog a kind of luxurious feeling!After dog\u2019s hair finished growing out, its transformation had also come to an end.The dog lied on the ground and groaned two times, displaying out a look as if it was on the brink of death. But when it saw Zhang Han took a step forward and was about to leave, it immediately jumped up and started running and jumping around Zhang Han.Looking at the dog\u2019s vigorous look, where was it even the Chinese rural dog before that could be slaughtered by just any person? Right now, the dog looked just like a prince within the world of dogs.\u201cFrom now on, let\u2019s call you Xiao Hei.\u201d Zhang Han lightly smiled, as he stretched out his hand to stroke the dog\u2019s head.(\u5c0f\u9ed1: Xiao Hei \u2013 literally means little black/small black.)Knowing that it now had its own name, Xiao Hei\u2019s tail started swaying back and forth, displaying out a very happy look.\u201cIt should be the smartest dog in this world right now right?\u201dZhang Han muttered to himself for a while, then pointed to the meat grass that was far away and said, \u201cGo pick one over.\u201dUpon hearing that, with a swoosh sound, Xiao Hei\u2019s body ran towards the meat grass. Its speed was very fast. After biting one meat grass, it started running back very quickly, then sat in front of Zhang Han, awaiting Zhang Han\u2019s next order.\u201cYou can eat it.\u201d Zhang Han shook his head, and not caring if it could understand or not, he said, \u201cFrom now onwards, you are the small housekeeper of this place. Looking after this place well and do not allow others to come up here.\u201dZhang Han stretched out his hands and gestured a few times.\u201cWoof woof\u2026\u2026\u201d Xiao Hei barked at Zhang Han two times, expressing that it understood.\u201cLet\u2019s see who can run faster!\u201d Zhang Han slightly smiled.The spiritual strength within Zhang Han\u2019s body gathered within his legs. When the extremity of his foot touched the ground, his entire body shot out just like an arrow. If one was to look closely, they would discover that the extremity of Zhang Han\u2019s foot did not touch the ground at all. Just after lightly tapping on the grass, Zhang Han body was already moving forward!If a martial expert was here, he would definitely say out those three words with astonishment,\u201cFlying above grass!\u201dUpon seeing that, Xiao Hei followed after Zhang Han quickly. Every step it took, it was able to move forward 3meters. Following closely behind Zhang Han, it ran imposingly, just like a lion that was whistling forward.After running all the way to the Jeep that was below the mountain, Zhang Han opened the car and took out a bottle of mineral water, then casually poured the water onto the roadside. After he finished pouring, Xiao Hei then finally ran up to here.After running down a distance of a kilometer, Xiao Hei did not even gasp for a single breath at all. Its physical strength had become much stronger.\u201cLet\u2019s run back. I will let you run ahead for 300meters first. Go.\u201dZhang Han spoke, wanting to test if Xiao Hei understood him or not.However, right after he finished speaking, Xiao He immediately turned around and ran. Xiao Hei reaction\u2019s made Zhang Han slightly went into a daze.\u201cSeems like\u2026\u2026the evolution of its brain was pretty good.\u201dZhang Han felt somewhat unexpected.There are different types of dogs and each of them has different intelligence too. Let\u2019s say, for example, golden retriever which had an intelligence ranking of rank 4. The intelligence of a fully grown golden retriever was equivalent to a child in the age of 7-8.A rural dog\u2019s intelligence was not that strong, but with the help of a trace of origin of the Thunder-Yang Tree and Pure-Yang Water, Xiao Hei\u2019s intelligence had most likely raised up quite a number of levels.After running back to the Thunder-Yang Tree, Zhang Han first stroke Xiao Hei\u2019s head, then pressed both of his hands onto Thunder-Yang Tree. The spiritual strength penetrated out of Zhang Han\u2019s body, then directed Thunder-Yang Tree to absorb the Pure-Yang Water within the cave below it.After the first transformation, the spiritual water in the ring-shaped cave became ample, and even the pond above and ponds for the poultry and pets were filled with spiritual water.There was a lot of spiritual water, but there was very little Pure-Yang Water.The amount of Pure-Yang Water that was available was only about 9 to 10liters. Just the amount of Pure-Yang Water that was given to Xiao Hei to use was already a liter.Right now, there was probably still 9liters of Pure-Yang Water left. Zhang Han used the mineral water bottle to fill up 600ml of Pure-Yang Water. This was prepared for Meng Meng to drink.Pure-Yang Water was able to improve a person\u2019s physique. However, continuing drinking Pure-Yang Water after drinking until full was a waste. The amount of energy a person\u2019s body was able to absorb was limited. A bottle of Pure-Yang Water was far too much for Meng Meng to drink alone, Zhang Han intended to let Zi Yan drink the rest of the Pure-Yang Water.No matter what, Zi Yan had indeed gone through 10 months of pregnancy to give birth to Meng Meng after all.After filling up the bottle with Pure-Yang Water, Zhang Han went down the mountain. From the edge of the forest, he waved towards Xiao Hei, instructing Xiao Hei to look after the domain, then drove the car and left.Currently, the sky had gradually become dark. Zhang Han first drove to the restaurant.Within the restaurant, renovation was still continuing on like wildfire. Within a day, half of the floor tiles on the first floor had already been spread, the wall bricks in the kitchen had also more or less been spread. On the second floor, the floor tiles had already all been spread and the workers were currently renovating on the walls and other objects and decorations.Returning back to the first floor, Zhang Han revolved his spiritual strength towards his nose and used his Treasure Smelling Nose.From the floor tiles, wall bricks, up to the jadeite television wall, he sensed that all of the objects were real, and thus Zhang Han was also reassured.Seems like this Zhao Kai was an honest merchant.After speaking a few sentences, Zhang Han left the restaurant and found a nearby hotel to stay at. On that night, he received a call from Zi Yan. The words were simple, simply telling Zhang Han to meet at the entrance of Ocean Park during tomorrow morning 10am.A night without words.Next morning, 9am.\u201cFei Fei, is this look of mine really okay? What if someone recognized me?\u201d Zi Yan looked at the mirror and said in a somewhat nervous tone.As a celebrity, one cannot go out that casually. Zi Yan still remembered back when she was super popular, there was a time when she was recognized at a shopping mall and was stuck there for more than an hour.Although today was not the same as the past, Zi Yan still subconsciously felt worried.\u201cPlease, my big sister Yan, don\u2019t you believe my makeup skill?\u201d Zhou Fei said helplessly, \u201cI guarantee no one will be able to recognize the current you. If we met on the street and you looked like this, even I would not be able to recognize you, let alone others.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Zi Yan looked at herself through the mirror.Gold color short hair, with a bob hair hairstyle. This was the wig that she wore. Her bright jet-black long hair was plated above. If one do not look closely, they would not be able to discover that.On the upper body, she wore an ordinary white short-sleeved shirt, and on the lower body, she wore cowboy shorts, revealing out her white and slender long legs. On her legs, she wore a pair of sneakers, revealing out a trace of pink color socks near her ankle.This style of dressing was poles apart from that kind of in sight but unattainable feeling when she was on stage. This style of dressing had a trace of unruliness and cheerfulness.Looking at her face, on her white cheeks, there were two moles that Zhou Fei had drawn. The two moles were each on the middle of both of the cheeks. Her eyelashes were very long. On both the outer corner of her eyes, a line that was slightly raising upwards was drawn.The blue color contact lens was worn on her eyes, and her willow brows were also drawn comparably coarse, each forming into a single line brow.\u201cFei Fei, those two moles are too ugly already. How about we remove the moles?\u201d Zi Yan said extremely awkwardly.Zhou Fei rolled her eyes petulantly and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want anyone to recognize you, remaining like this is the best.\u201d\u201cBut, but\u2026\u2026\u201d Zi Yan hesitated. Although this makeup gave her another kind of flavor, but it also made her a bit uglier!Women who love to look pretty naturally like to dress up themselves prettily.\u201cNo buts! This will do. Let\u2019s quickly set off.\u201d Zhou Fei pouted her mouth as her gaze looked towards the bedroom and shouted, \u201cMeng Meng, quickly come, we are setting off now!\u201d\u201cComing! Coming!\u201d Meng Meng ran out with a happy look on her face.She was drinking milk in the bedroom just now. Currently, there was still a drip of milk in the corner of her mouth.Little princess\u2019s attire was also very fashionable. A white color fashionable capri pants, light blue short-sleeved shirt and small sneakers. Running over, she hugged Zi Yan\u2019s long legs and called out, \u201cMommy, hug hug.\u201dZi Yan bent down and carried Meng Meng. The little princess was currently 15kg. With Zi Yan\u2019s weak physique, carrying Meng Meng for a while was still fine. But if she carried Meng Meng for too long, she would become tired.After coming downstairs, Zhou Fei drove the car towards Ocean Park. After sending off the mother and daughter, she was intending on going to the company to work.\u201cWhere is daddy?\u201dPeople come and go at the entrance of Ocean Park. Meng Meng\u2019s gaze was looking around, wanting to find her daddy within the crowd.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Daddy is here! Daddy is here!\u201dLittle princess\u2019s eyes were very sharp. When Zhang Han walked towards them from another side, the little princess immediately saw her daddy who she yearned for day and night.Thus, she starting wriggling in Zi Yan\u2019s embrace as she stretched out her little arms to request her daddy to hug her.\u201cMy little darling, have you miss daddy?\u201d\u201cMiss, miss, miss.\u201d Meng Meng lightly kissed onto Zhang Han\u2019s cheek.\u201cHow much did you miss daddy?\u201d Zhang Han smiled.\u201cVery, very, very much.\u201d Meng Meng surrounded her arms around Zhang Han\u2019s neck, her little cheek sticking to Zhang Han\u2019s cheek.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Zhang Han laughed out brightly, then swayed the three entrance tickets in his right hand and said, \u201cI have bought the tickets, let\u2019s go in.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright. Go play! Play the very, very tall Ferris wheel.\u201d Meng Meng raised both of her hands happily.Zhang Han took a look at Zi Yan who was keeping silent at the side. She was wearing a large size sunglasses, and her expression couldn\u2019t be seen.However, when Zhang Han talked to her, his tone was not as gentle as when he was talking to Meng Meng. His voice became somewhat indifferent as he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201dAfter finish speaking, he carried Meng Meng and walked towards the entrance.Zi Yan went into a daze for a while, then felt angry in her heart.What was the meaning of that? Using that kind of indifferent tone when speaking to me?Although she wasn\u2019t dressed as pretty as she was back then, she was still a through and through big beautiful woman! Could it be that you are blind? There was not even a sentence of praise at all?\u201cHumph! Blinded and crude rigid brain!\u201d Zi Yan snorted and followed up after them.Xiangjiang\u2019s Ocean Park was a world-class theme park which gathered both sea and land animals, motorized games and large-scale performances all into one places. It was the most popular in the world and was one of the theme parks that had the highest visits.Ocean Park and Disneyland were the two big characteristic amusement location in Xiangjiang.\u201cFerris wheel, let\u2019s go play Ferris wheel.\u201d Little princess made a racket to go sit the Ferris wheel.Every time, Meng Meng would often see the tall and big Ferris wheel on the television, and had always wanted to play the Ferris wheel, but her mommy had never brought her to Ferris wheel to play before.\u201cAlright, alright, alright. We will go play the Ferris wheel.\u201d Zhang Han smiled and said.Zhang Han carried Meng Meng and straightforwardly went towards the direction of the Ferris wheel, not even caring if Zi Yan who was behind him would be able to follow after him, and furthermore also did not turn his head over once to check.This kind of attitude had truly made Zi Yan felt incomparably angry in her heart!\u201cUngrateful little thing!\u201dZi Yan petulantly rolled her eyes at Meng Meng. It was fine if her daddy\u2019s heart was big, but how could she also forget about her after entering into Zhang Han\u2019s embrace?Zi Yan was very angry, and thus the aftermath was very grave.She immediately slowed down her pace, intending to see when they would finally notice her. If they did not notice her, humph, I will go play on my own!Fortunately, when queuing up, Meng Meng\u2019s big clear eyes looked around left and right.\u201cEh? Where is mommy? Daddy, we have lost mommy.\u201d Meng Meng said with a nervous face, within her tone, there was urgent and afraid.Zhang Han looked around, and spotted Zi Yan\u2019s figure at 10meters away behind them, then said,\u201cWe did not lose your mommy. She is at there. You take a look.\u201dWhile speaking, Zhang Han raised Meng Meng above his head.The taller one stood, the further one was able to see. After Meng Meng was raised up, she immediately saw Zi Yan who was at the back and shouted,\u201cMommy, mommy, I\u2019m here, quickly come.\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201dZi Yan lightly snorted, then squeezed through the crowd and came over.\u201cI thought that you had already forgotten about your mommy.\u201d Zi Yan said petulantly.\u201cI did not forget about mommy. Mommy hug hug.\u201d Meng Meng stretched out her little arms.Zi Yan carried the little princess over into her embrace, then did the gloominess in her heart disappeared.After finish queuing up, they took the staircase and came to the bottom part of the Ferris wheel. Under the staff member\u2019s indication, the three of them quickly entered into a small cabin.\u201cClang.\u201dThe staff member closed the door and the Ferris wheel slowly departed from the entrance stop.The speed of the Ferris wheel was not fast, and would also not stop. People were able to adapt to its speed to enter and exit the cabin. Within the small cabin, there was a crescent-shaped sit, and in the middle, there was a supporting disk. The surrounding glass was very clean. When looking out through the glass, the clarity was very high.Zhang Han and Zi Yan sat face to face, while Meng Meng sat within her mommy\u2019s embrace, as her big eyes looked around with a very happy look on her face.However, as the height slowly increased and reached the middle of the Ferris wheel\u2019s height, Meng Meng felt somewhat afraid and stopped exclaiming, as she said pitifully,\u201cDaddy, I\u2019m scared scared.\u201d\u201cMeng Meng don\u2019t be scared. Come, let daddy hug.\u201d Zhang Han carried meng Meng over and said with a comforting tone, \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, everything is all right. It is very safe here. Look at the scenery there, look at the big sea, look at those birds\u2026\u2026\u201dZhang Han continuously scattered Meng Meng\u2019s attention. At the start, the effect was still quite good. But as the Ferris wheel got higher and was about to reach the peak.The wind outside of the cabin began to get bigger, blowing the cabin and causing the cabin to sway slightly, the axis of rotation that connected the cabin to the Ferris wheel also started to make a crackling sound.Sitting within the cabin, the sound could be heard clearly, giving people a kind of psychology feeling that the cabin was not sturdy, and subconsciously thinking that an accident would happen, causing them to feel even more scared.Don\u2019t say Meng Meng, even a lot of adults would have this kind of psychological fear.For example say, a certain adult that was sitting face to face with Zhang Han.Zi Yan\u2019s eyes which were hidden under the sunglasses were already shut closed. She pursed her lips and grabbed onto the sit with her hand. In her heart, she was scared to death, but at this time, no one came to comfort her.Zhang Han was only paying attention to Meng Meng who was extremely nervous. Without choice, he lifted up his own white short-sleeved shirt and covered Meng Meng\u2019s head, and starting playing peek-a-boo with her.After playing for a while, Meng Meng then got over being nervous and once again began to giggle.All the way until the Ferris wheel went past the peak region and was near to reaching the ground, Zhang Han then let the little princess out from his shirt and said lightly,\u201cSee, we are reaching back down already.\u201d\u201cWah, daddy, there are so many people down there.\u201d\u201cDaddy, you look at there, there are so many balloons.\u201d\u201cDaddy, you look, you look\u2026\u2026\u201dMeng Meng forgot about being afraid and was very excitedly pointing in different directions for Zhang Han to see.\u201cPhew\u2026\u2026\u201dZi Yan also opened her eyes, then exhale out a long and deep breath. Her tense heart also became relaxed.Unknowingly, her back had already been wet by her sweat. At the same time, towards Zhang Han, she felt a trace of dissatisfaction in her heart. Why did he only focused on comforting Meng Meng and did not came to comfort her even once?After coming down her the Ferris wheel, Zhang Han carried the little princess and went towards the next stop, Ocean Spectacle Aquarium.At Ocean Spectacle Aquarium, there was a kind of feeling that one was walking towards the depth of the ocean from the blue dream palace, which the little princess liked a lot.Zhang Han and Zi Yan each helped each other took a few joint photos with Meng Meng. While they were taking photos, suddenly, a woman who was in her twenties that was beside them came up and said with a smile,\u201cHow about I help you family of three take a joint photo? If you all can\u2019t take a joint photo after coming out on a trip together, how regretful would that be?\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Zi yan who was holding the camera slightly went into a daze, then passed the camera over to the women.\u201cCome, have a smile. You all can come a bit closer. The little princess is so adorable. That\u2019s right, just like this, alright.\u201d The woman helped took three photos very passionately.This seemed to be the first joint photo of this family.Zi Yan\u2019s heart was feeling a bit complicated.After giving thanks, the passionate woman also left.Continue moving forward, the place that shocked Meng Meng the most in the aquarium was the revolving pond, where a bunch of silver milkfish continuously swim around to feed, seemingly just like a silver fog rotating around, giving one a feeling that they entered into a fantasy world.After strolling finish the aquarium, the time had also come to afternoon 1pm.Zi Yan suggested going to Ocean King Dragon Restaurant to eat and rest.Ocean King Dragon Restaurant was within the aquarium, letting the customers be able to enjoy the scenery in the aquarium while eating culinary delicacies.Looking at the surrounding environment, Zhang Han was considering if he should make a real Ocean Park for Meng Meng to play at.When it was time to eat, Zhang Han took out the mineral water bottle that was filled with Pure-Yang Water from his back.\u201cMeng Meng, drink this bottle of water.\u201d Zhang Han opened the cap and was prepared to let Meng Meng drink.Meng Meng also did not care what it was and opened her mouth to drink.Upon seeing that, Zi Yan was shocked, and said, \u201cHey! What is in this bottle? You are just giving it to Meng Meng like this?\u201d\u201cThis is good stuff.\u201d Zhang Han lightly smiled.Glug, glug, glug\u2026\u2026Meng Meng drank 1/3 and her small mouth left the bottle. Patting on her stomach, she said in a cute voice,\u201cI\u2026I drank full already.\u201d\u201cYou drink the remaining.\u201d Zhang Han passed the battle over to Zi Yan and said.\u201cWho wants to drink your rotten water!\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s words were rejecting, but her body was very honest, as she immediately extended out her hand and took the bottle.When she drank the first mouth, Zi Yan felt a sweet fragrant taste.This is not milk?Zi Yan slightly went into a daze. This sweet fragrant made her couldn\u2019t help but drank finish the remaining water in the bottle. After finishing, she still felt somewhat wishing to continue, as she said,\u201cWhat water is this?\u201d\u201cA kind of water that is beneficial to the body.\u201d Zhang Han answered indifferently, then stood up and carried the little princess as he walked towards the back.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Zi Yan asked.\u201cBathroom.\u201dZi Yan wanted to ask Zhang Han why he was bringing Meng Meng if he was going to the bathroom, but at the next moment, the overwhelming feeling in her abdomen made her knew the reason.\u201cThis bastard! Could it be laxative?\u201dZi Yan clenched her teeth as she stood up and ran towards the bathroom.Pure-Yang Water was able to improve a person\u2019s physique. As everyone knows, within a person\u2019s body, there would more or less be some places which were not healthy, like say for example dense blood, weak kidney, impotence, premature ejaculation and so on.After drinking down Pure-Yang Water, those unhealthy places could be changed by, just like being given new life. Since there was poison within the body, then the way to expel poison was to have diarrhea.In the bathroom, Zi Yan continuously cursed Zhang Han. She felt that her entire body was numb and tingling, and even her skin was too. After staying in the bathroom for close to 20minutes, then did she came out. When she was washing hands and saw herself in the mirror, her complexion slightly changed.Her cheeks were extremely smooth, the foundation that she used on her face in the morning and the two moles were gone, seemingly as if she had not used any makeup. Her skin was soft and tender, as if water could be pinched out. Furthermore, she felt entirely refreshed and clear-headed, the exhaustion that she got from strolling around for three hours had all been swept away.\u201cThat water\u2026is really good stuff?\u201dZi Yan was curious. Walking out of the bathroom, she saw that Zhang Han and Meng Meng was currently tasting the delicacies that just got sent up.\u201cZhang Han, what is the thing that you gave us to drink?\u201d After sitting down, Zi Yan asked.\u201cIt can be counted as a tonic.\u201d Zhang Han replied, \u201cYou take a look, didn\u2019t your skin become much better?\u201d\u201cThen why did Meng Meng not have any changes?\u201d Zi Yan asked, feeling confused.\u201cI have changed! Meng Meng has become pretty.\u201d Meng Meng mumbled indistinctly while eating.\u201cMeng Meng is still small, and her skin was already good originally. How big are you already, yet you still keep using cosmetics. The foundation that you apply on is all harmful towards your skin.\u201d When talking about cosmetic, Zhang Han had a somewhat dislike sounding tone.Liked it?

    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - Night Travelling Mount New MoonPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euA beautiful woman who has beauty capable of causing the downfall of a city did not need to put on makeup. Those who needed to wear makeup to become beautiful were also not called a true beautiful woman.Speaking about makeup, Zi Yan immediately felt angry and said petulantly, \u201cYou still have the cheek to say? I normally only put on light makeup, and all those makeup that I used were all high-end international brand makeups. Just because I wore makeup, you told Meng Meng to not kiss me? What is the meaning of that!\u201dSeeing that Zi Yan had the intention of criticizing him, Zhang Han shook his head. Being too lazy to argue with a woman, he thus said indifferently, \u201cLet\u2019s eat. After finish eating, we will go to the mountaintop park.\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d Zi Yan lightly snorted, then began to start eating the delicacies in front of her.In Ocean Park, there was two big park area, at the bottom of the mountain was the seaside park, and at the mountaintop was the peak park. After finish eating, the family of three sat on the sightseeing cable car to go towards the mountaintop and played at the peak park for an entire afternoon.When the sky gradually became dark, the family of three left Ocean Park.To speak as a whole, today\u2019s outing was enjoyed to the fullest, and Zi Yan\u2019s exhaustion due to her work and tensed nerve also became relaxed.\u201cYou only just came to Xiangjiang and you already have a car. Seems like your life is not as terrible as I thought out to be.\u201d At the back of the car, while Zi Yan carried the little princess who had gotten tired, she couldn\u2019t help but mumbled.\u201cThe car is rented.\u201d Zhang Han replied a sentence, then after thinking, he opened his mouth and said, \u201cI will send you home.\u201d\u201cNonsense! If not did you expect to let me and Meng Meng grab a cab?\u201d Zi Yan said petulantly.\u201cI am saying that I send you home, and Meng Meng comes with me.\u201d Zhang Han added.Upon hearing that, Zi Yan\u2019s brows wrinkled and her tone became cold, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cYou are busy with work and do not have time to take care of Meng Meng.\u201d Zhang Han thought for a bit, then said, \u201cMy meaning is that, let me take care of Meng Meng. When you have the time, you can just come and visit her.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright! Meng Meng wants to be together with daddy.\u201d When talking about this, even though Meng Meng was tired, she still raised up her hands and cheered. Compared to letting Wang Juan look after her, she of course preferred much more to be together with her daddy.\u201cNo!\u201d Without even thinking at all, Zi Yan rejected with a stiff tone.\u201cWhy not?\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s brows twitched.\u201cMeng Meng is mine!\u201d Zi Yan glared at Zhang Han and said without the slightest bit of intention of giving in.Zhang Han looked at Zi Yan who was being fiercely protective of her own children and couldn\u2019t help but laughed. His tone became gentle as he said, \u201cI am not wanting to snatch Meng Meng away from you. Meng Meng will always be your daughter. I only want to prepare some nutritious food for her, so that she grow up healthily and happily. Also, I have already more or less prepared everything.\u201d\u201cMommy, can we be together with daddy please?\u201d When Meng Meng who was small but clever saw that a chance came, she began continuously pleading within Zi Yan\u2019s embrace.\u201cYou are only making food for her to eat?\u201d Zi Yan asked.Currently, there was already hesitation within her tone. Seeing Meng Meng\u2019s look, she somewhat couldn\u2019t bear to reject her.Her time was also indeed not a lot too, and would not have a lot of time to accompany Meng Meng. Especially in the coming period where she most possibly had to go to other places that were outside of Xiangjiang to shoot for her MV.\u201cEn.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cNot right!\u201d Zi Yan glared at Zhang Han and said, \u201cYou are lying to people again, anyone is able to make food that is nutritious.\u201d\u201cWhen did I ever lie to people before?\u201d Zhang Han slightly went into a daze.From small to big, he had never lie to anyone before. He had always done whatever that he said he would do. There was no such thing of him lying.However, Zi Yan\u2019s answer made Zhang Han somewhat not to know whether to laugh or cry.\u201cWasn\u2019t the Paradise Land that you talked about last time counted as lying to Meng Meng?\u201d Right now, you say you want to make nutritious food for Meng Meng. Couldn\u2019t Aunt Wang make food that is nutritious for Meng Meng?\u201d Zi Yan lightly snorted and said.(Changed Utopia to Paradise Land as Paradise Land sounds better and fits better for \u2018\u4e16\u5916\u6843\u6e90\u2019.)\u201cDaddy lie people? There is no Paradise Land?\u201d Meng Meng blinked her eyes, and felt somewhat broken-hearted, having a look that she was about to cry at any moment.\u201cThere is Paradise Land! How could daddy ever possibly lie to you? If you don\u2019t believe, I will bring you to there to take a look alright?\u201d Zhang Han said hurriedly, then took a look at Zi Yan somewhat with blame.\u201cEh?\u201d Meng Meng\u2019s expression very quickly turned from gloomy to clear and said, \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cReally, daddy bring you to go take a look now alright?\u201d Zhang Han said with a smile.\u201cAlright!\u201d In a moment, Meng Meng was happy again.Upon seeing that, Zi Yan slightly went into a daze and felt puzzled in her heart,Looking at this fellow\u2019s confident look, could it be that there is really a Paradise Land?Looking at Zhang Han driving towards the direction of Crescent Gulf, Zi Yan felt that he seemed to have really made out something.\u201cWhere are you bringing us to?\u201d In the end, Zi Yan couldn\u2019t resist the curiosity in her heart and opened her mouth to ask.\u201cGo, go Paradise Land!\u201d Meng Meng snatched first to reply.\u201cHahaha.\u201d Zhang Han laughed while shaking his head, and said, \u201cYou will know when we reach the place.\u201d\u201cHumph, act what mysterious!\u201d Zi Yan pouted her mouth and moved her gaze towards outside of the window.Bamboo District\u2019s distance was not far from Crescent Gulf, driving car only took about 20 minutes.When the car passed by Crescent Gulf and continued towards the direction of Crescent Mountain, Zi Yan wanted to ask again, but her lips wriggled two times and in the end, she did not ask.She knew that even if she asked, it was also no different from not asking, this rigid brain would definitely not say anything.When they reached the bottom of Crescent Mountain, the car came to a stop.\u201cWe have reached the place, let\u2019s get off the car.\u201d Zhang Han clapped his hands and said.\u201cYou are not serious, right? After all this, you brought us to this desolate place?\u201d Zi Yan opened her eyes wide.\u201cYou will know when you get off.\u201dZhang Han smiled mysteriously and got off the car first.Zi Yan carried Meng Meng and curiously got off the car. After walking forward for two minutes, they reached the borderline area of Crescent Mountain.The sky had already become dark, the moonlight of the bright moon sprinkled on the ground, even if there was no radiance, the scenery of the surrounding area could be seen clearly, but the forest in front was however a piece of total darkness.The trees were in great number and crowded together, thus blocking out the moonlight. A piece of pitch black made Zi Yan felt somewhat terrified in her heart.\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Zi Yan asked with a slight trace of nervousness.\u201cUp the mountain!\u201d Zhang Han answered shortly and simply.\u201cUp the mountain!\u201d Meng Meng shouted out excitedly. However, she was also somewhat afraid of the dark. Looking at the forest in front of her, she said in her small and cute voice, \u201cDaddy, it is too dark in front, Meng Meng is scared scared.\u201d\u201cCome, daddy carry you and you will not be afraid anymore.\u201d Zhang Han took over Meng Meng who was stretching out her little arms from within Zi Yan\u2019s embrace.After carrying Meng Meng for a few minutes, Zi Yan was also indeed somewhat tired, thus she straightforwardly placed Meng Meng into Zhang Han\u2019s embrace.\u201cDaddy call out a playmate for you alright?\u201d Zhang Han carried the little princess and asked.\u201cAlright! What playmate?\u201d Meng Meng said with an adorable expression.Currently, even Zi Yan was also somewhat curious, not knowing just what Zhang Han was trying to do.It could be seen, Zhang Han took two steps forward then shouted, \u201cXiao Hei!\u201d\u201cWoof, woof\u2026\u2026\u201dThe sounds of the barking of a dog came from the top of Crescent Mountain.\u201cDog?\u201d Zi Yan slightly went into a daze.Within less than two minutes, a bunch of rustling sound could be heard from the underbrush in front of them.Suddenly, a black figure jumped out from the underbrush in high speed!Xiao Hei\u2019s body size was that of a fully grown Tibetan mastiff. In a moment, Zi Yan did not see clearly what the black figure was and opened her eyes wide as she let out a cry in fear, \u201cAh!\u201d\u201cWah!\u201d Upon hearing her mommy\u2019s shouting sound, Meng Meng also shouted out from being nervous.\u201cWo\u2026oof!\u201dThe two shouting sound scared Xiao Hei and caused him to quiver. His quick speed immediately came to a stop as he lied his body down on the floor and crawled forward. On his face, a bit of small grievance could even be seen.If he was able to open his mouth to speak, he would definitely say,\u201cWhat are you all doing? I came to welcome you all with good intentions and you all actually let out such a frightening sound!\u201d\u201cWhat, what kind of dog is this?\u201d Zi Yan grabbed onto Zhang Han\u2019s sleeve with both of her hands and asked.\u201cChinese rural emperor dog.\u201d Zhang Han lightly replied.\u201cEmperor dog?\u201d Zi Yan went into a daze.\u201cWow! What, what a beautiful dog.\u201d Meng Meng said with her eyes full of hearts, \u201cDaddy, can I touch him?\u201d\u201cSure, go on and touch.\u201d Zhang Han lowered his body, allowing the little princess to be able to reach Xiao Hei.Upon seeing that, Xiao Hei happily shook his tail, got up on his legs, and slightly lowered his head as he moved closer to Meng Meng.\u201cMeng Meng, you cannot touch it!\u201d Zi Yan said, \u201cWe still don\u2019t know whether if it bites or not. Moreover, there are a lot of germs on the body of doggies, so you cannot touch them.\u201dAlthough Zi Yan also was very fond of hairy dogs, it was still a fact that there were a lot of germs on dogs, therefore children cannot be intimate with dogs.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Zhang Han lightly smiled and said, \u201cHis name is Xiao Hei. He had also drunk the water that you all drank just now. Right now, there are no germs on his body, and he would also not drop hair normally. There\u2019s no odor on his body, and even his mouth is not smelly too. So, you all can play with him at ease. Zi Yan, you can also try touching him.\u201dWhile speaking, Meng Meng who was within Zhang Han\u2019s embrace had already touched Xiao Hei\u2019s head a few times.\u201cYou are lying to people again, where is there this kind of dog in this world?\u201d Zi Yan lightly snorted and said.In her tone, there was somewhat of a trace of a woman\u2019s charm which even she herself did not notice.\u201cI lie to you for what?\u201d Zhang Han said somewhat speechlessly.\u201cI will believe you for once then.\u201d Zi Yan smiled towards Zhang Han, which happens very rarely. Stretching out her hand and touching Xiao Hei\u2019s head a few times, she felt that Xiao Hei\u2019s hair was extremely soft and smooth, making it feel very comfortable to touch.\u201cAlright, let us go up the mountain. Xiao Hei, lead the way.\u201d Zhang Han opened his mouth and said.Upon hearing his master\u2019s order, Xiao Hei straightened his chest and raised his head as he shook his tail and butt and walked forward proudly.Xiao Hei slowly walked forward, leading the way for the family of three behind.Zhang Han carried Meng Meng, while Zi Yan grabbed onto Zhang Han\u2019s sleeve as they entered into the pitch-black forest.It felt dark outside, but when inside, it could be discovered that it wasn\u2019t that dark at all. The trees around could be seen clearly with the help of dim moonlight.After walking for five minutes, the view in front suddenly became wide.Zi Yan and Meng Meng also became the first batch of visitors to visit Crescent Mountain.\u201cWow, what a beautiful place.\u201d Zi Yan said somewhat pleasantly surprised.From here, the scenery of the front of the mountain could be seen. Pieces of green and verdant grass and the clear air made Zi Yan actually felt somewhat longing for this kind of countryside lifestyle in her heart.However, the sky was after all somewhat dark, and she was also not able to clearly see the bunch of flowers at the other side. If she was able to clearly see it, Zi Yan\u2019s mood would most likely be a few times more excited. After all, women all extremely loves beautiful things like fresh flowers.\u201cWow, wow, wow, what, what a beautiful place!\u201d Meng Meng imitated Zi Yan\u2019s tone and said exaggeratedly. Suddenly, the little princess line of sight saw the extremely cool and dazzling Thunder-Yang Tree which was at the mountain peak.\u201cDaddy, daddy, you look at there, what a big big tree!\u201d Meng Meng stretched out her little arm and pointed towards the direction of Thunder-Yang Tree.\u201cEh?\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s gaze moved to the direction Meng Meng was pointing and immediately let out a bewildered sound, then said, \u201cWhat is this tree? This is so strange.\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - Zi Yan was movedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThis is called Thunder-Yang Tree.\u201d Zhang Han introduced simply.\u201cThunder-Yang Tree? Why have I never heard of this name before?\u201d Zi Yan asked confusedly.\u201cLet\u2019s go up and take a look.\u201d Zhang Han did not answer anymore and walked forward while carrying Meng Meng.When they came under Thunder-Yang Tree, the line of sight here became extremely wide.From here, the scenery of the ocean can be seen from afar. Even the beach at Crescent Gulf could be seen clearly, and also the city of Crescent Gulf under the night, which was dazzlingly beautiful.From nearby, the beauty of the area at Thunder-Yang Tree could already be discovered. A circle-shaped open space, which was practically filled with green lawn, and at the back, there were a few ponds of different sizes which reflected the bright moon.\u201cThis place is so beautiful!\u201dZi Yan exclaimed sincerely.Zhang Han slightly smiled and did not reply. This was only still Crescent Mountain during the night. If they were to come during the day, the scenery here would be a lot better.\u201cAh, daddy, mommy, you all look there, there are so many small houses.\u201d Meng Meng pointed to the direction of the back of the mountain and said.\u201cEh? On top of the small houses seems to be tree leaves.\u201d Zi Yan stared at the little houses for a bit. After all, it was night time currently, and Zi Yan could not see clearly from afar.\u201cLet us go over there to take a look.\u201d Zhang Han smiled and said somewhat slightly proud, \u201cHow is Meng Meng? Is the Paradise Land that daddy build for you nice?\u201d\u201cNice! Nice! It is very nice! Meng Meng like it. Daddy is so good.\u201d Meng Meng happily clapped her hands and pouted her little mouth and kissed onto Zhang Han\u2019s cheek.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhang Han laughed out happily, and led towards the back of the mountain while saying, \u201cThis is still not the finished product, in the future, it will become more beautiful, and when that time comes, it will become a true Paradise Land. At the mountain peak, daddy will build a few big houses, at the back of the mountain, I will raise some animals to accompany you to play\u2026\u2026\u201dAt the back, Zi Yan looked at the scene in front of her, and her gaze became slightly blank.\u2018Zhang Han has changed already.\u201dZi Yan mumbled in her heart. In those five years, she had also paid attention to Zhang Han before. Towards some news of Zhang Han, she knew it all. She never thought that after bringing Meng Meng back, it would actually make Zhang Han changed so much.Not only did he left Shangjing, he even really build a Paradise Land for Meng Meng. Furthermore, only how many days had he been at Xiangjiang up till now?\u2018Meng Meng has also become much more cheerful than before.\u2019From Meng Meng\u2019s smile, it could be seen that she had become much more cheerful. Also, even if Zi Yan did not want to admit, children indeed really needs a father\u2019s love. Children who grew up in a single-parent family since they were young were indeed somewhat pitiful. Be it a father\u2019s love, or a mother\u2019s love, it would be a regret to lack either one of it. Only a complete and happy family would be able to give children the best growth, no matter if they were poor or rich.\u201cWow, it is real tree leaves. Mommy, you quickly come, quickly come and touch it.\u201dMeng Meng\u2019s shout pulled Zi Yan back from her thoughts.\u201cIt is real tree leaves?\u201d Zi Yan slightly went into a daze. Walking forward, she touched the tree leaves on that was on the top of an exquisite small house.\u201cHow did you manage to make those?\u201d Zi Yan looked towards Zhang Han confusedly.\u201cSimply by covering the leaves on the small houses.\u201dBy covering\u2026\u2026Zi Yan went into a daze again. Those bunch of neatly arranged leaves, how long had he took to make it?\u201cMeng Meng, those small houses in this area are for doggies, cats and other pets. The small houses at the other side are for ducks, chickens, and gooses. The bigger houses are for pigs and sheep. The much bigger houses are for dairy cows. Those few small ponds are for all the animals to drink and swim at. The big pond at there is\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhang Han began introducing the place to Meng Meng.After finish hearing, Meng Meng was extremely happy, looking forward to the scenario where there would be a lot of small animals.And as for Zi Yan, she remained silent beside Zhang Han.Everything that Zhang Han did had truly been extremely thorough. At that side, there was actually even a planting area, where he intended to even grow wheat and rice by himself.He was speaking the truth, he really wanted to make some pure green nutritious food for Meng Meng. He also truly wanted to take good care of Meng Meng.Regarding the healthy growth of Meng Meng\u2019s body, Zi Yan also cared a lot about it. Therefore, right now, in her heart, she was already somewhat agreeing to temporarily let Meng Meng be taken care of by Zhang Han.Thus, after thinking a bit, she asked, \u201cYou do not have a place to stay at. Where will Meng Meng stay at if she comes with you?\u201d\u201cI have a place to stay at!\u201d Zhang Han knew that, if he wanted to let Meng Meng stay with him, he must first convince Zi Yan. Thus, he said with a very gentle tone, \u201cLet me bring you go take a look at the place. Meng Meng, it is late now, we have to go back already. We can only move and stay over here after this place has been build finish.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng pouted her mouth and nodded her head. Looking at Xiao Hei who was wandering around at her side, she said in her small and cute voice, \u201cXiao Hei, Xiao Hei, bye bye.\u201d\u201cWoof, woof\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Hei barked a few times gloomily. After sending the family of three to the edge of the forest while swaying his big tail, he then turned around and went back.Zi Yan and Meng Meng sat in the back seat. Meng Meng was somewhat tired already, lying down on the back seat and sleeping soundly.Zhang Han drove the car towards the restaurant at Crescent Gulf.\u201cEh? Not right!\u201d Suddenly, Zi Yan glared and said, \u201cZhang Han, you are lying to people again!\u201d\u201cWhen did I lie to people again?\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s expression froze.When this woman doesn\u2019t open her mouth, everything was calm, but when she opened her mouth, she immediately startled people!\u201cWasn\u2019t that Crescent Mountain just now? How could you make so many things at the mountain? Humph! Furthermore, with just the time of a few days? I say, it must be just a random place you found to deceive me, so that you could swindle Meng Meng away from my side!\u201d Zi Yan said in a bad tone.\u201cI am truly impressed by your brain.\u201d Zhang Han took a look at Zi Yan from the rear view mirror, then took out a bunch of documents from the glove compartment box at the front passenger seat and passed it over to Zi Yan, \u201cTake a look yourself, this Crescent Mountain is rented by me!\u201dZi Yan took over the documents and casually took a few looks, then discovered that it was really rented by him.Thus, she\u2026\u2026petulantly took a glare at Zhang Han.If it was rented, so be it then! Why do you have to speak so stiffly! Rigid brain!Zi Yan\u2019s heart was somewhat dissatisfied towards Zhang Han. Why was he so gentle towards Meng Meng, but when speaking to her, he would always be somewhat stiff?It was true that if there was no comparison, there would be no harm.Upon reaching outside the restaurant, Zhang Han pouted his mouth towards the restaurant and said, \u201cThis place has been rented by me. Within a week, the renovation will be finished. The materials used for the renovation are all environmentally friendly, so it can immediately be lived at after the renovation finish. It is very dusty inside so there is no need to go inside to take a look now.\u201d\u201cRetail house?\u201d Zi Yan asked, \u201cYou are intending to open a restaurant?\u201d\u201cMore or less.\u201d\u201cYou are renting both the mountain and the retail house. Where did you get so much money from?\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s brows slightly frowned.She had seen the contract for renting Crescent Mountain. The rent was 10million rmb, and she reckoned that the rent of this retail house was more or less around 3million rmb. The total of renting both of the mountain and retail house was more than 10million rmb.\u201cI sold the house at Bamboo District.\u201d Zhang Han said lightly.\u201cSell house?\u201d Zi Yan slightly went into a daze, she felt somewhat unexpected.\u201cEn.\u201d Zhang Han shook his head and said, \u201cWhere do you stay at?\u201d\u201cEast District, Mingguang Street\u2019s Yunyin Garden.\u201d Zi Yan answered.Zhang Han immediately turned and drove towards the direction of East District. There were no words during the whole journey. When they reached East District, Zhang Han opened the navigation system and drove to Yunyin Garden.Upon reaching downstairs, Zi Yan lightly carried Meng Meng.Being moved, Meng Meng muddle-headedly opened her eyes.\u201cWhere is daddy?\u201d Meng Meng looked around somewhat muddle-headedly and nervously.Meng Meng saw Zhang Han who came out of the car to open the door for Zi Yan and stretched out her little arms as she said feebly, \u201cDaddy, hug hug.\u201dZhang Han stretched out his hands and carried Meng Meng in his embrace, then followed Zi Yan to the elevator door.\u201cAlright, daddy will send you up to here. After the restaurant\u2019s renovation finished, daddy will come and pick you up.\u201d Zhang Han lightly kissed onto Meng meng\u2019s adorable cheek and passed Meng Meng over to Zi Yan.\u201cEh?\u201d Meng Meng went into a daze. Only now then did she knew that her daddy was only sending them off, and not going up with them.\u201cBoohoo\u2026don\u2019t\u2026daddy don\u2019t go\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng pursed up her small mouth and started crying.\u201cAlright Meng Meng, didn\u2019t you hear what your daddy say? We will go and find your daddy to play in a few days alright? Be obedient.\u201d Zi Yan lightly consoled.But no matter how Zi Yan coaxed, Meng Meng did not stop crying, and was even struggling desperately within Zi Yan\u2019s embrace.When the little princess struggle around, after carrying Meng Meng for two minutes, Zi Yan felt that her arms became very tired, thus she placed Meng Meng into Zhang Han\u2019s embraces and said petulantly,\u201cAlright, alright, alright! Will it do if your daddy comes up with us? Meng Meng, don\u2019t cry already, won\u2019t it do after mommy promise you already?\u201dMeng Meng hugged onto Zhang Han\u2019s neck, with her head leaning on his shoulder. After hearing Zi Yan\u2019s words, she gradually stopped her crying and said pitifully, \u201cDaddy, you cannot go, you have to accompany Meng Meng.\u201dZhang Han sighed in his heart.If it was during normal times, he who was somewhat male chauvinist would not randomly stay at Zi Yan\u2019s house. But seeing Meng Meng\u2019s pitiful look, Zhang Han simply did not have the heart to reject her.\u201cDaddy will accompany you, daddy won\u2019t leave.\u201d Zhang Han said with a smile and lightly patted Meng Meng\u2019s back.Following Zi Yan into the escalator, after Zi Yan\u2019s swipe her escalator card, the button for the 12th floor lighted up.This building only had 17 floors, but because it was a duplex apartment building, and the height of each story was not low, the building was even higher than a normal 35 stories high building.In each story, there were two elevators, two stairs, and two households, thus coming up and down was very convenient and there was really no need to wait very long for elevator most of the time.Arriving at the 12th floor, they came to apartment 21 and Zi Yan opened the door, then gave Zhang Han a pair of disposable slippers.Normally when there was a guest, they would be given this kind of slippers, which could be thrown away after use, and guests would also felt that it was hygienic. Zhang Han could only be counted as half a guest, and the other half was, of course, the identity of Meng Meng\u2019s father.Right now, Zi Yan\u2019s heart was feeling somewhat complicated. She felt somewhat awkward bringing Zhang Han into her house.\u201cWelcome back Miss.\u201d Wang Juan walked over and said with a smile.\u201cEn.\u201d Zi Yan nodded her head.\u201cThis mister is\u2026\u2026\u201d Wang Juan asked hesitatingly.\u201cHe\u2026\u2026\u201d In a moment, Zi Yan was somewhat bashful, feeling somewhat embarrassed to introduce Zhang Han\u2019s identity.Although Zi Yan was embarrassed, there was a little princess who was not embarrassed. It could be seen, Meng Meng said with great joy, \u201cHe is my daddy!\u201d\u201cHe is called Zhang Han.\u201d Zi Yan introduced in a low voice.\u201cHahaha.\u201d Wang Juan went into a daze, then laughed afterward and greeted hurriedly, \u201cHello Mr Zhang.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201dZhang Han nodded his head, then walked into the living room while carrying Meng Meng and looked around.The decoration style was quite unique, similar to the villa that Zhang Han was satisfied with at the intermediary company.The decoration style belonged to modern style and slightly leaned to comfort, with most of the colors being white and crossover of blue and green.\u201cOh!\u201dSuddenly, an astonished screech appeared.Zhou Fei could be seen slowly walking down from the second floor. After seeing Zhang Han, she was truly stunned as she screamed out loudly, \u201cOh my god, a rare guest! The wretched big young master who has a smelly bad temper came to honor us with your presence at this humble home?\u201dZhou Fei had observed Zi Yan being angered by Zhang Han back then, thus she also remembered Zhang Han. Upon meeting him, she couldn\u2019t help but ridicule him a bit.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 - Staying at Zi Yan\u2019s housePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBad Aunt Feifei, you cannot talk badly about my daddy!\u201dZhang Han did not have any expression but Meng Meng herself was not happy about it as she said towards Zhou Fei with an angry face.\u201cYou this little traitor!\u201d Zhou Fei petulantly rolled her eyes, redrawing back the words that she wanted to continue ridiculing Zhang Han with.\u201cAlright, Xiao Fei, don\u2019t mess around already.\u201dZi Yan rolled her eyes at Zhou Fei. Taking off her wig and sunglasses, she undid her hair bun, dispersing her long hair, then shook her hair.Long fluttering hair, adding on her with eye-catching body, it made even Zhang Han raised his eyebrows.\u2018Indeed very beautiful.\u2019Zhang Han couldn\u2019t help but muttered in his heart.\u201cWow oh, mommy is so beautiful.\u201d The little princess praised with her small voice, not knowing when she would also be to shake around with her long hair.\u201cYou are also very beautiful.\u201d Zi Yan stroked Meng Meng\u2019s head with a smile, then took a look at Zhang Han and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs. Upstairs is where Meng Meng, I, and Zhou Fei sleep at. At the first floor, other than Aunt Wang\u2019s room, there is still 2 guest room available. You can stay in one of the guest room today.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201dZhang Han nodded his head, then followed Zi Yan upstairs.The space on the second floor was not small, there was a big living room. A carpet was spread on the staircase and below the handrail of the staircase, fence that was the shape of a net was installed.\u201cDaddy, daddy, put Meng Meng down.\u201dUpon coming upstairs, Meng Meng began wriggling around within Zhang Han\u2019s embrace.After Meng Meng stood on the floor, her expression was very happy, as she ran forward excitedly. On the sofa, there were a bunch of small rag dolls, and on the coffee table that was at the front of the sofa, there were also a lot of toys.\u201cDaddy, come quickly.\u201dMeng Meng began sharing each of her toys with Zhang Han.\u201cWow, this one is really pretty. Wow, this big tiger is really scary. What is this? Mickey Mouse?\u201d With a slightly exaggerating tone, Zhang Han played around with Meng Meng.Meng Meng chuckled non-stop, \u201cPretty isn\u2019t it? Does it look like Meng meng? Daddy, I tell you, this, this tiger won\u2019t bite people, you see\u2026\u2026Daddy, this is not Mickey Mouse, this is Donald Duck, daddy is so silly\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTsk, he sure knows how to coax a child!\u201d At the door of the room that was in the back corner, Zhou Fei curled her lips and mumbled.\u201cYou cannot speak badly about him in front of Meng Meng anymore in the future. Right now, Meng Meng is very fond of him.\u201d Zi Yan who was changing inside the room opened her mouth and said.\u201cBig Sister Yan.\u201dZhou Fei walked into the room, closed the door, and then asked in a small voice, \u201cWhy did you let that fellow come here?\u201dZi Yan slightly went into a daze, then replied, \u201cBecause Meng Meng was crying very badly, so I let him come here.\u201dMeng Meng\u2019s crying was perhaps only the small part of the reason she let Zhang Han come to her house. The bigger part of the reason was because Zi Yan saw the things that Zhang Han did for Meng Meng, saw his change, and also the abundant of fatherly love he had on him.Towards Meng Meng, he had truly done his utmost effort.She herself also never thought that only after seeing each other for a few days, Zhang Han would actually be that doting towards Meng Meng. Perhaps this was the family love of the so-called, blood is always thicker than water.\u201cBig Sister Yan, this won\u2019t do!\u201d Zhou Fei said with a trace of nervous in her tone, \u201cIf you let that fellow come in touch with Meng Meng for too long, what will you do if he snatches Meng Meng away? You do not have much time to accompany Meng Meng because of your work. It won\u2019t be good if that fellow took the opportunity to snatch Meng Meng away from you. Big Sister Yan, you think about it, what if he finds a stepmother for Meng Meng in the future? Towards someone who was not her own child, that stepmother will definitely not treat Meng Meng well!\u201dAfter Zhou Fei finished speaking, Zi Yan\u2019s gaze congealed.Zi Yan began letting her imagination run wild. When the image of Meng Meng being beat by the stepmother appeared in her mind, her body couldn\u2019t help but trembled. With a resolute tone, she said,\u201cNo! I will definitely not allow this kind of situation to happen!\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s right.\u201d Zhou Fei rolled her eyes around, then said, \u201cThere is a method that is feasible!\u201d\u201cWhat method?\u201d Zi Yan asked.\u201cIf worst comes to worst, Big Sister Yan you will just have to sacrifice yourself for a bit and get together with that fellow. This way, since the both of you are Meng Meng\u2019s biological parents, there will be no more worries!\u201d Zhou Fei said while holding back her laughter.\u201cWhat are you anyhow talking about.\u201dZi Yan petulantly gave Zhou Fei a push, then rolled her eyes and said, \u201cI do not like Zhang Han this kind of rigid brain.\u201dThe prince charming in her heart was the kind of gentle that was both handsome and refined, and must also be multi-talented and have a kind heart.Zhang Han was far apart from the prince charming in her heart.\u201cI think so too. He is not even comparable to that Prince Li.\u201d Zhou Fei nodded her head, agreeing deeply with Zi Yan..\u201cDon\u2019t anyhow say.\u201dZi Yan\u2019s brows slightly wrinkled. From the bottom of her heart, she somewhat dislike Prince Li that kind of flirty person.After changing into a relaxing night clothes, Zi Yan walked out of the room and saw Meng Meng was currently happily playing with Zhang Han.Carrying the little princess into the bedroom by force, after helping Meng Meng change into her night clothes, when she let go of her hand, Meng Meng immediately rushed out of the bedroom to continue playing with Zhang Han.If it was normal times, this house would not be very noisy, even more, at this timing, the little princess would have already have fallen asleep. But because of Zhang Han\u2019s arrival, this house immediately became lively.In the living room, it was filled with Meng Meng\u2019s bell-like juvenile laughter, and also Zhang Han\u2019s bright laughter occasionally. Even Aunt Wang who was in the bedroom on the first floor was able to hear their laughter.All the way until 11.30pm, the little princess was still playing happily, but she was however told by Zi Yan solemnly to go to sleep.\u201cHumph! Bad mommy, Meng Meng still haven\u2019t played enough.\u201d The little princess said angrily.Zi Yan was helpless towards Meng Meng, thus she glared at Zhang Han. Under Zhang Han\u2019s persuading, then did the little princess agreed to go to sleep, but her daddy has to tell her a bedtime story first.Thus, Zhang Han walked into Zi Yan\u2019s and Meng Meng\u2019s bedroom.Meng Meng\u2019s bed was a small bed, and Zi Yan\u2019s bed was a normal bed. There was a small and big bed, but both of the bed had the same characteristic, which was that there were quite a few hairy dolls on both of the bed.Seems like Zi Yan still had the heart of a young girl.Zhang Han lightly smiled.After telling story to Meng Meng for a while, Meng Meng deeply fell asleep.After gently covering Meng Meng with her small quilt, Zhang Han walked out of the bedroom quietly.Just after opening the door, he heard Zhou Fei\u2019s somewhat angry words coming from the living room,\u201cWe have already finished choosing the song, so I went to the manufacture department, but in the end, the people in the manufacture department said that the quality of the song was not good and will not spend too many resources and energy to shoot the MV, and can only shoot a simple and ordinary MV! This is truly angering me to death! After that, I went to see the old witch. But do you know what happened in the end? She didn\u2019t even care at all and even said: \u2018If you are not satisfied with the MV\u2019s quality, you can spend your own money to go and hire a good team!\u2019 What kind of words are those? Are you not one of the company\u2019s performing artist\u201d?Zi Yan\u2019s brows slightly wrinkled, as she said lightly, \u201cI will go and find Big Sister Mei to try and talk about it tomorrow.\u201d\u201cBig Sister Yan, even if u go, it will also be useless. You are no longer favored by that old witch anymore. Furthermore, the people in the manufacture department are right too, the quality of the song is indeed not good. How about you reconsider about the album?\u201d\u201cIf we don\u2019t release the album and continue dragging on, there won\u2019t be any chance coming to us too.\u201d Zi Yan shook her head.She had also somewhat understood some things. The company temporarily did not intend to spend resources on her. Perhaps it was because has-been celebrity was hard to make a comeback, or it could also perhaps be that Prince Li meddling about. No matter what reason it was, the end result was that Zi Yan will be not getting any resources any time soon.Rather than dragging on, she might as well just straightforwardly release out an album first.Although the quality of the song was a bit lacking, at the least, by releasing the album, it would be able to awaken others\u2019 memories of her. Furthermore, Zi Ya believed in her heart that her huge amount of fans in the past were still fond of her!\u201cRelease album?\u201d Zhang Han sat on the corner of the sofa, took a look at Zi Yan and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you changed from a singer to an actress? Why do you still need to release an album?\u201d\u201cI have not appeared in people\u2019s view for 5 years already. I\u2019m not as popular as I am back then now. Isn\u2019t all this because of you?\u201d Zi Yan rolled her eyes at Zhang Han and said.\u201cEh\u2026\u2026\u201dZhang Han became speechless.This woman always seemed to be eating gunpowder when talking to him!\u201cIf your album\u2019s song is not good, how about\u2026\u2026\u201dZhang Han still hasn\u2019t finished speaking and Zi Yan\u2019s face immediately became cold as she said, \u201cI don\u2019t need you to care about my matters!\u201dAfter finish speaking, Zi Yan stood up and walked towards her bedroom.Seeing Zi Yan\u2019s expression, she seemed to be panting with rage.\u201cTsk, who told you to shoot your mouth off, serves you right!\u201d Zhou Fei curled her lips and said, then walked towards her bedroom.Zhang Han\u2019s brows slightly wrinkled as he stood up and went downstairs.While walking down the stairs, he mumbled,\u201cTruly, good intentions being treated as donkey\u2019s liver and lung. If you were not Meng Meng\u2019s mother, I would not even bother to ask you anything.\u201d(\u597d\u5fc3\u5f53\u6210\u9a74\u809d\u80ba \u2013 Good intentions being treated as donkey\u2019s liver and lung: During ancient time, donkey\u2019s lung and liver were not worth anything. Not sure about now though.)Zhang Han originally had good intentions when he asked Zi Yan about her album. The development course of this life was slightly different from his previous life. Some celebrities totally did not appear in this life at all. But Zhang Han was somewhat familiar with the works of some of those celebrities. Adding on, he also had knowledge regarding music. Therefore, it was not very hard to reproduce the songs from his previous life that did not appear in this life.Originally, he wanted to give Zi Yan a small help, but the other person didn\u2019t seem to be interested at all. Thus, Zhang Han felt that there was no need for him to stick his warm face to a cold butt.((\u70ed\u8138\u8d34\u51b7\u5c41\u80a1 \u2013 Sticking warm face to a cold butt: To describe warm feelings meeting with cold rebuke.)However, how would Zi Yan have known Zhang Han\u2019s thoughts?Zi Yan still very clearly remembered the words Zhang Han said during the last time they quarrel. She thought that the words Zhang Han was going to continue saying were, \u2018How about you just immediately retire and forget about it. What is good about being an actor on the television screen?\u2019Zi Yan subconsciously did not want to talk to Zhang Han about this topic, and also dislike talking about this topic with Zhang Han, therefore she coldly interrupted him just now.Even more, when Zi Yan returned to her bedroom and lied down on her bed, she still mumbled some words angrily in a small voice.Those words were simply words like \u2018scoundrel\u2019, \u2018rigid brain\u2019, \u2018bad temper\u2019, and so on.Zhang Han walked into the spare bedroom that was downstairs. The structure of the bedroom was similar to that of a hotel. There was a bathroom, and the bedding and other items were brand new. Zhang Han took off his clothes, then lied down on the bed and fiddled with his phone. After a while, he also deeply fell asleep.Originally, with his way of thinking, he was not willing to stay here. His identity was relatively awkward. He was not Zi Yan\u2019s husband, but he had a child with ZI Yan. In this kind of situation, he also felt somewhat awkward spending the night at Zi Yan\u2019s house.However, he wanted to bring Meng Meng out to play during the next day, thus he endured the awkwardness and stayed the night here.Next day, morning 8am.Wang Juan already prepared breakfast. The breakfast was relatively simple. There was the sweet potato porridge which Meng Meng and Zi Yan like to eat, a plate filled with 7 boiled eggs, some small steamed bun which was bought at the supermarket and some salted vegetables.Zhang Han sat in the living room that was on the first floor and casually watched the television. When it was 6am+, he had already woke up, but there was not a bit of movement upstairs at all. All the way until 8am, then did the 2 muddle-headed adults and Meng Meng came downstairs.\u201cDaddy!\u201dMeng Meng rushed forward while jumping and running, then threw herself into Zhang Han\u2019s embrace while with a look of happiness on her face.This was still the first time she had experience waking up from bed and being able to see both her daddy and mommy together at the same time.\u201cAiyo, what a little traitor. Ever since she had met up with that fellow, she wouldn\u2019t even let Aunt Feifei kiss her. Tsk, tsk.\u201d Zhou Fei said with a face of jealousy.Liked it?

    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - domineering qiPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDaddy, daddy, Meng Meng have been obedient, I have not kiss Aunt Feifei. Mommy also has been obedient, only after showering nice nice then will she let Meng Meng kiss her.\u201dHearing Zhou Fei\u2019s words, Meng Meng then remembered. After finish speaking, she waited for her daddy\u2019s praise with full of expectation.Regarding this aspect, Zhang Han had never let the little princess be disappointed before.Zhang Han could be seen saying with a smile, \u201cMeng Meng is so obedient! Daddy will reward you with an ice cream later on alright?\u201cAlright, alright, daddy is the best!\u201d Meng Meng giggled with a happy face.\u201cZhang Han, what is the meaning of this! This is truly angering me to death!\u201d Zhou Fei glared at Zhang Han and said, \u201cWhere would people teach children like this. I have watched Meng meng grow up since she was small. You only came for a few days and you are already teaching children about bad things!\u201d\u201cAlright Xiao Fei, let\u2019s eat. After finish eating, we still have to go to the company.\u201d Zi Yan pursed her lips and said, \u201cAlso, I feel that what Zhang Han said is quite true. Kissing onto makeup foundation is indeed not very good.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dHearing that, Zhou Fei went into a daze, then opened her eyes wide as she said in an exaggerated tone, \u201cAlright, alright, alright. You family are coming together to bully me. Big Sister Yan, I have truly misjudged you! Zhang Han has only come for two days and you are already just like a woman who follows along with her man!\u201d\u201cWhat are you anyhow talking about?\u201d Zi Yan rolled her eyes at Zhou Fei.\u201cHehehe, let\u2019s eat, let\u2019s eat!\u201d Zhou Fei laughed and ran to the front of the dining table.\u201cLet\u2019s go eat.\u201d Zhang Han carried Meng Meng to the dining table.\u201cDaddy, that tall tall chair is mine.\u201d Meng Meng said as she pointed to the tallest chair.Zhang Han placed Meng Meng on the chair, then sat on her right side, intending to feed Meng Meng. Originally, feeding Meng Meng was Wang Juan\u2019s daily work, but seeing Zhang Han was intending on personally feed Meng Meng, Wang Juan slightly smiled and went back to the kitchen to tidy up.\u201cMommy, come and sit here.\u201dUpon seeing Zi Yan sitting in front of her, Meng Meng was somewhat dissatisfied, thus she pointed to the chair on her left side and commanded.\u201cAlright, alright, alright, listen to you.\u201d Zi Yan slightly smiled, then took the tableware and sat on the left side of Meng Meng.Seeing that the left side was her mommy, and the right side was her daddy, Meng Meng raised her little arms with a happy and blessed face.\u201cCome, Meng Meng, have a mouth of porridge. Have a mouth of milk. Eat the egg yolk, don\u2019t be picky about food, egg yolk has the most nutrition. Don\u2019t eat the salted vegetables, it is not good to eat too much of salted vegetables\u2026\u2026\u201dZhang Han sat at the right side and did not start eating first but instead started feeding Meng Meng a mouthful by another mouthful. The trace of tenderness in his expression was caught by Zi Yan\u2019s eyes.Having her parents accompany her, Meng Meng was truly very happy. Even the egg yolk which she usually did not like to eat was now eaten by her eagerly.Also, after coming into contact with Zhang Han, Meng Meng had also become cheerful. A father\u2019s love was truly very important.Zi Yan once again thought to herself as she slightly sighed in her heart.She and Zhang Han both had their own respective live and social circle. It was uncertain if they would be able to be together in the future. Who knows how long this kind of happy period of time would last for Meng Meng.Just thinking about it was enough to make Zi Yan feel at a loss, because when that time comes, Meng Meng would definitely be very broken-hearted.\u2018Should I really get together with Zhang Han?\u2019This question has recently been lingering in ZI Yan\u2019s heart. Zhang Han was once a second generation rich, and was currently down and out. Although Zi Yan had seen Zhang Han\u2019s gentle side, he was still not the type of guy Zi Yan was looking for in her heart.\u2018Love cannot be compromised.\u2019Zi Yan shook her head once again. For this kind of thing, there was no other choice but to take a step forward step by step and see how things go with every step. Furthermore, it was going to be very busy in the coming days, so there was no time to think about personal matters.Zi Yan thought in her heart. If Zhang Han was to know her thoughts, it was reckoned he would definitely curl his lips and say,\u2018I haven\u2019t even say that I was going to get together with you and you are already thinking about it. Moreover, how can getting together with me, Han Yang Immortal Monarch, be counted as you sacrificing?\u2019However, Zhang Han did not know Zi Yan\u2019s thoughts and Zi Yan would also not say out her current thoughts. Who could even be sure about what would happen in the future?After finish eating, Zi Yan and Zhou Fei stood up and left. They intended to carefully alter those songs that they have chosen for a bit, and the workload for that was not small. Furthermore, Zi Yan wanted to ask Mei Qi about the matter regarding shooting the MV.After they left, the little princess also more or less finish eating. Zhang Han simply ate a few mouthfuls, then carried Meng Meng to sit on the sofa on the first floor to rest.After Wang Juang finished tidying up the dining room, she walked over and asked with a smile,\u201cMr Zhang, where are you from?\u201d\u201cShangjing.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cIs Mr Zhang used to being here?\u201d Wang Juang asked. She knew that Zi Yan was a big celebrity in the past, and thus was somewhat curious about Zhang Han in her heart. However, even though she was curious, her evaluation towards Zhang Han was not high.She felt that men who came to live at a woman\u2019s house had no big capability. Zi Yan stayed in such a big house, and furthermore, a house which was in Xiangjiang, thus Zi Yan was definitely wealthy. Wang Juan was somewhat worried in her heart that Zhang Han was the kind of scum male who would come find Zi Yan to ask for money.After all, there were too many such cases in the society. However, seeing how things were currently, Zhang Han was quite conforming to the norms of society. But that wasn\u2019t enough to dispel Wang Juan\u2019s bit of vigilance. Thus, she intended to simply ask about Zhang Han\u2019s situation.\u201cStill okay.\u201d Zhang Han faintly replied, not having the intention to chat with Wang Juan, he carried Meng Meng who was watching the television on the sofa.\u201cAiya, smelly daddy, Meng Meng is watching the television.\u201d Meng Meng said with an unwilling face.\u201cMeng Meng, daddy bring you to go out play.\u201d Zhang Han kissed onto Meng Meng\u2019s cheek and said.\u201cEh?\u201dMeng Meng\u2019s eyes lighted up and stopped watching the television as she turned her head towards Zhang Han and said happily, \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cDaddy bring you to Paradise Land which we went to yesterday alright?\u201d Zhang Han said gently.\u201cOh yay, alright, alright, go out play!\u201d In a moment, Meng Meng became extremely happy.Normally when mommy was not home, Meng Meng was not able to go out play and was only able to stay at home. Now when daddy was here, he was able to bring Meng Meng to go out play. This straightforwardly made Zhang Han\u2019s figure in Meng Meng\u2019s heart became much taller.\u201cMuack, muack, muack.\u201d Meng Meng kissed a few times onto Zhang Han\u2019s face.\u201cDaddy bring you to go change clothes first.\u201d Zhang Han smiled and carried Meng Meng to the second floor.When going out to play, it was only natural to not wear pajamas.At this time, Wang Juan\u2019s expression froze for a moment. Normally when Zi Yan was not home, she did not allow others to bring Meng Meng out to play.Of course, Wang Juan herself was an outsider, and she also subconsciously took Zhang Han as an outsider too. She was after all hired by Zi Yan. If there was anything, she naturally had to ask Zi Yan. Thus, she took out her face, walked to the kitchen and dialed Zi Yan\u2019s phone,\u201cHello, miss, Meng Meng\u2019s father wants to bring her out to play.\u201d\u201cOut where?\u201dShe originally thought that Zhang Han would leave by himself today during the morning since he still had that mountain he needed to tend to, and the restaurant was still renovating.The important thing was that, within Zi Yan\u2019s complicated heart, she did not want to let Meng Meng come into contact with Zhang Han every day. She was still really afraid that in the future, there would come a day when Zhang Han would take Meng Meng away from her.\u201cI don\u2019t know, I only heard him saying that he was bringing Meng Meng to Paradise Land or something. They are currently on the second floor changing their clothes.\u201d Wang Juan said in a low voice.\u201cThat place?\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s brows wrinkled and said, \u201cGo to that place for what? That place is sunny during the day. Let Zhang Han go by himself. Alright, Aunt Wang, I have to go to work already.\u201dAfter finish speaking, Zi Yan hanged up the phone and straightforwardly walked towards Mei Qi\u2019s office.At another side.Zhang Han helped Meng Meng changed into her clothes. A thin jacket, with a short-sleeved shirt worn on the inside, and on the lower part of the body was a blue color trendy jeans.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dMeng Meng stretched out her little arms while within Zhang Han\u2019s embrace and said in high spirits.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dZhang Han smiled while shaking his head. Coming down to the first floor, he saw Wang Juan silently standing right at the door.Just when Zhang Han was intending to change his shoes, Wang Juan smiled awkwardly and said,\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr Zhang, I just called and asked the miss, and she said that she did not want to let Meng Meng go out as the weather outside is somewhat hot. Therefore\u2026Mr Zhang, if you are busy\u2026\u2026\u201dFrom her words, it could be seen there was somewhat of the intention of seeing a visitor out.\u201cNo! I want to go out play with daddy!\u201d Upon hearing that, Meng Meng said very angrily.\u201cShe told you that?\u201d Zhang Han took a look at Wang Juan.\u201cYes.\u201d Wang Juan nodded her head.\u201cI will talk to her about it then.\u201d Zhang Han took out his phone, wanting to call Zi Yan to ask her what the matter was. But, after calling 3 times, Zi Yan still did not pick up the phone.\u201cNever pick up?\u201d Zhang Han kept his phone, not intending to continue calling. Taking a look at Wang Juan, he said indifferently, \u201cYou tell her later on that, no matter where I want to bring Meng Meng to play, I don\u2019t need to obtain her consent.\u201dWhat kind of joke was that? If I want to bring my own daughter out to play, I still have to first ask for her approval?Even with Zhang Han\u2019s indifferent temperament, he still felt somewhat unhappy right now in his heart. If this situation was substituted with the Zhang Han who was still a hedonistic young master, it was reckoned he would have exploded right from the start.Right now, Zhang Han did not want to bother about any things, did not want to care about fame and fortune, did not want to pay attention to things of the world, and did not want to get into any dispute. He only wanted to take good care of Meng Meng and enjoy the carefree and worry-free country lifestyle.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201d Wang Juan\u2019s face became bitter.Zhang Han did not pay attention to her. After helping Meng Meng wore a pair of white color small sports shoes, and wore his leisure shoes, he was intending to leave the house next.Upon seeing that, Wang Juan hurriedly moved her body to block Zhang Han and said with a bitter smile, \u201cMr Zhang, please don\u2019t make things difficult for me. If I were to let Meng Meng go out, miss will blame me when she gets back home.\u201d\u201cOh? You afraid of her blaming you and not afraid of me blaming you?\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s gaze congealed.\u201cYou really cannot bring Meng Meng out. Mr Zhang\u2026\u2026\u201dWang Juan still wanted to persuade Zhang Han, but Meng Meng interrupted her angrily, \u201cOld witch, you, you quickly move away, you are blocking the path. Careful I let my daddy beat you!\u201dA child\u2019s learning ability was extremely strong. Zhou Fei said \u2018old witch\u2019 in the house a few times and Meng Meng was able to remember it.Wang Juan\u2019s expression froze. She was rather helpless, she also did not want to be the bad person. But she had no choice, she must follow her miss\u2019s words.\u201cIt will be alright, you can be at ease, Zi Yan she will not blame you.\u201d Zhang Han smiled faintly, as he intends to go around Wang Juan\u2019s body, but who knew, Wang Juan moved and blocked him again.\u201cMr Zhang, please understand, it is also very difficult for me.\u201d Wang Juan said bitterly.This time, Zhang Han\u2019s complexion became indifferent. A tiger doesn\u2019t show his might and you take me as a hello kitty?He gazed at Wang Juan with a tranquil look, but he was just like an emperor gazing at a commoner. It was seen, Zhang Han indifferently said out two words,\u201cMove aside.\u201dThe words were ordinary, but Wang Juan felt an astonishing pressure!This kind of pressure was the kind of pressure she felt before on those people who had stayed in the upper position for a long time. Also, the pressure she felt from Zhang Han was the one which had the biggest pressure, there was no other. She herself was also not sure why Zhang Han was able to give her such a big pressure.Wang Juan was slightly somewhat absent-minded, and in the end, she moved her body aside.Zhang Han faintly took a look at her, then carried Meng Meng and went out.\u201cSigh.\u201dWang Juan took a sigh. Although the pay for working in the house of a big figure was high, it was also not simple.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 - Zhang\u2019s educationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euAfter Zhang Han left, Wang Juan dialed to Zi Yan\u2019s phone number for a few time, and finally, on the sixth time, the call went through.Wang Juan said bitterly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry miss, I was not able to stop Mr Zhang, he brought Meng Meng out to play.\u201d\u201cEn, I got it.\u201dZi Yan said, then hung up the phone.She was currently walking back to her own office. At Mei Qi\u2019s office, she had confirmed about the matters regarding the shooting of the MV. Mei Qi could arrange a team for her, but the team arranged could only be a secondary team, as the best team was currently helping Xu Ruoyu.Furthermore, Mei Qi had also persuaded her to release her album a bit later on, there was no need to be in such a rush. However, Zi Yan straightforwardly rejected it. Sometimes, she was just like Zhang Han, both having their own obstinate, and wouldn\u2019t turn their head back even if they bumped into the south wall.(\u5357\u5899 \u2013 South Wall: South wall refers to the spirit screen, which is also called spirit wall or screen wall.)(\u5f71\u58c1\u5899 \u2013 Spirit Screen: Used to shield an entrance gate in traditional Chinese architecture)When Zi Yan returned back to her office, she dialed Zhang Han\u2019s phone number.At this time, Zhang Han and the little princess just came to the first floor. Seeing that the phone call was from Zi Yan, Zhang Han straightforwardly rejected the call.\u201cEn? Reject my phone call?\u201d Zi Yan felt angry in her heart and continued dialing Zhang Han\u2019s phone number.After ringing for less than 2 seconds, the phone call was once again rejected. This time, when she dialed Zhang Han\u2019s phone number again, she was notified that the phone was turned off.\u201cScoundrel, this rigid brain scoundrel!\u201dZi Yan clenched her teeth angrily!Since Meng Meng was already brought out, Zi Yan also did not want to say anything else, and only wanted to just remind Zhang Han to pay attention and not let the sun shine too much on Meng Meng. After all, that Crescent Mountain was a large area of blank space.Zhang Han was very straightforward, turning off his phone and placing the phone into his pocket with a calm face.He thought that Zi Yan was calling him to criticize him violently. Not caring about those, he intends to carry out Zhang Family\u2019s education to Meng Meng.\u201cMeng Meng, does that Aunt Wang treat you well normally?\u201d Zhang Han asked with a smile.\u201cStill, still okay.\u201d Meng Meng answered.\u201cThen why did you call her old witch? And even wanted daddy to beat her?\u201d Zhang Han asked lightly.\u201cBecause, because she did not let Meng Meng go out play, so Meng Meng don\u2019t like her.\u201d Meng Meng pouted her small mouth and said.\u201cMeng Meng.\u201d Zhang Han looked at the little princess and said sternly, \u201cYou cannot be like this in the future, you have to learn to respect others you understand?\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Meng Meng said with a somewhat gloomy tone.This was still the first time daddy scolded me. Humph, I\u2019m not happy.\u201cDaddy is also not scolding you. Although they are all insects, but you have to respect those who treat you well. Towards people who don\u2019t treat you well, you can scold them however you want. Even more, you don\u2019t have to open your mouth and daddy will put that person in order for you.\u201d Zhang Han said with a smile.\u201cDaddy, I understand.\u201d Who knows if Meng Meng understood or not, Meng Meng pouted her mouth and nodded her head with a serious expression.\u201cMeng Meng is so obedient. Daddy will buy an ice cream for you in a while.\u201d Zhang Han patted Meng Meng\u2019s head.\u201cAlright! I want a big big icecream. Meng Meng wants to eat it together with daddy.\u201d Meng Meng giggled happily.Zhang Han carried the little princess and placed her at the back seat, then drove the car, departing away from Yunyin Garden.\u201cMeng Meng, you have to remember what daddy told you just now.\u201dZhang Han was scared that Meng Meng would forget and couldn\u2019t help but said it again, \u201cThere is a saying, \u2018people respect me 1 foot, I return them back 10 feet\u2019, which means that when people give you a foot of respect, you have to respect them back 10 feet.\u201dThis was counted as Zhang Han\u2019s standard of conduct. Back when he was at the Cultivation World, when other people show incomparable respect to Zhang Han, Zhang Han would tip them with enough money for them to spend for hundreds of years.\u201cHowever.\u201d Zhang Han turned the topic and said with a trace of domineering aura, \u201cAt the back of the saying, there is another sentence, which is \u2018people destroy a grain of mine, I will destroy ten thousand dou of theirs\u2019! The meaning of this sentence is that, when people destroy a bit of your thing with malice, you should straightforwardly destroy a thing of theirs which is worth ten thousand times more!\u201dThe original sentence was, \u2018people destroy a grain of mine, I will destroy three dou of theirs\u2019. But at Zhang Han here, it straightforwardly became \u2018I will destroy ten thousand dou of theirs\u2019.(\u4eba\u656c\u6211\u4e00\u5c3a,\u6211\u8fd8\u4eba\u4e00\u4e08,\u4eba\u6bc1\u6211\u4e00\u7c9f,\u6211\u706d\u4eba\u4e09\u6597: People respect me a foot, I return them back 10 feet, people destroy a grain of mine, I destroy three dou of theirs.)(\u6597:dou \u2013 1 dou is roughly 7200gram)Just like back when Zhang Han destroyed those 10 super sects, it was because those 10 sects corporate together to wipe out the treasures at one of Zhang Han\u2019s palace when he was not around. At that time, because Zhang Han did not show his strength much in the Cultivation World, no one really knew how high his cultivation was.Thus, Zhang Han let everyone took a clear look at his cultivation, destroying the 10 super sects with incomparable strength. There were very few people who were able to attain this kind of accomplishment.The sentence that Zhang Han said was quite profound and Meng Meng did not really understand the sentence, but she still nodded her head with a serious expression and said in her small voice,\u201cI, I understand, daddy.\u201d\u201cEn\u201d Zhang Han smiled slightly and said, \u201cGood. However, you must also remember this sentence okay? The sentence is \u2018You insects, when you respect me 1 foot, I will return you 10 feet, but when you destroy a grain of mine, I will destroy ten thousand dou of yours\u2019. Come, try saying it one time.\u201d\u201cYou insects!\u201d Meng Meng remembered those two words quite clearly, but somewhat could not remember the words afterward and kept on en en ah ah, not being able to say out the words while having an anxious look on her face.Zhang Han told Meng Meng word by word, Meng Meng then said in her small voice,\u201cYou, you respect me a foot, I will return you 10 feet, you\u2026destroy a grain of mine, I will\u2026destroy ten thousand dou of yours!\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201d Zhang Han laughed heartily. Just so happens that they were passing by a parking lot, Zhang Han thus stopped the car at the roadside and said, \u201cDaddy carry you go buy an ice cream. That is your price for being well-behaved.\u201d\u201cWah, alright, eat ice cream!\u201d Meng Meng giggled happily while she raised and shook her small hands around.Zhang Han carried the little princess and bought an ice cream. Meng Meng ate two bites from the ice cream happily, then passed to her daddy to let him have a few bites.Zhang Han straightforwardly took two bites and finished off 2/3 of the ice cream.\u201cEh?\u201dMeng Meng looked at the ice cream which was left with only 1/3 and went into a daze.\u201cHmmm, so delicious, Meng Meng, you eat it too.\u201d Zhang Han held in his laughter and said.\u201cOh.\u201d Meng Meng blankly nodded her head and began eating the ice cream one small by bite by another.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u2026\u201dLooking at Meng Meng\u2019s adorable look, Zhang Han laughed brightly.Actually, he did not really liked eating things like ice cream which was overly sweet. The reason he ate 2/3 of the ice cream was because he did not want Meng Meng to eat too much of it.Driving the car, Zhang Han headed towards South District\u2019s seed breeding base.At Xiangjiang, rice, flour and other ingredients were normally imported. There were very few ingredients that were grown in Xiangjiang. During the early morning, Zhang Han only found a seed breeding base after searching on the internet for half an hour.Zhang Han intends to begin planting green ingredients today. With the help of the spiritual soul and spiritual water, the growing period of every ingredient would be reduced by a lot. Also, after the ingredients finished growing, even if the the ingredient were not harvest, the ingredients would still be able to maintain it most perfect state, all the way until it was harvest.This was one of the strongest function of spiritual water and spiritual soil.\u201cHello mister, can I ask what do you intend to buy?\u201d A middleman came up and asked.Seed breeding base, not only does it grow its own crops, it was also at the same time Xiangjiang\u2019s biggest distribution factory. All kind of food were sold here. The venue was at the inner side of South District, built leaning against a mountain. At the back was a big piece of land and there were quite a few vast tents there too.\u201cI want to buy some seeds.\u201d\u201cBuy seeds?\u201d The middle age man went into a slight daze, he originally thought that Zhang Han came to distribute food and never thought that Zhang Han was here to buy seeds. Normally when people came here to buy seeds, they wouldn\u2019t buy a lot too. After all, at Xiangjiang, people normally did not have a really big piece of land to use for growing crops. Therefore, the smiling expression in the middle age man lessened somewhat.\u201cWhat kind of rice seeds do you all have here? For the relatively better one, what brand do you all have?\u201d Zhang Han asked.\u201cMiser, are you intending to grow it yourself?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d\u201cWe have a lot of different brands of seeds here, no matter if it is mainland brand or oversea brand, we have it all. Let me go take the list to show you.\u201dAfter the middle age man finished speaking, he turned around and took a list from the counter.Zhang Han took a look at the list simply. He had not heard of most of the brands listed in the list, but he saw a name and straightforwardly pointed to it and said, \u201cI will take Wuchang Daohuaxiang rice.\u201d\u201cOh, an expert eh?\u201d The middle age man smiled while feeling unexpected, then said, \u201cSeems like mister has some knowledge towards rice. Wuchang Daohuaxiang rice is one of mainland H province general rice.\u201dThe middle age man introduced, \u201cThe Wuchang Daohuaxiang rice we have here is Daohuaxiang rice number 2. This rice possesses fragrant, sweet, good texture and so on other merits.\u201d\u201cDaohuaxiang rice belongs to long grain rice and even the rice seedlings would emit out a kind of fragrance. The rice is also very fragrant. When cooking the rice, a sweet fragrant smell would be accompanied by it. This Wuchang Daohuaxiang rice is renowned through the whole nation, and is currently one of the most superior quality rice.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Zhang Han lightly nodded his head.After the middle age man finished introducing, he said, \u201cHowever, the price of Wuchang Daohuaxiang rice is also a bit higher. In mainland, Daohuaxiang rice that is real cost 20rmb for every catty. Even at H province, it also cost 10rmb and above for every catty. As for our Xiangjiang, it costs 50rmb per catty. Furthermore, it will only do if you are able to buy the real goods. Right now on the market, most of the Daohuaxiang rice have other rice mixed into it. Contrariwise, if mister you grow the rice yourself, it would be the most reassuring compared to buying the rice from other places.\u201d\u201cEn, the price does not matter, you can just directly sell me the seeds.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head and said.\u201cSure.\u201d The middle age man took out a piece of paper and pen, then said, \u201cWhat is the quantity that you want?\u201d\u201cRoughly for 200 square of land.\u201d Zhang Han thought and replied.The amount of land left out for rice was around 200 square, a relatively small land. For wheat, there was also around 200 square of land. Rice and wheat were first in priority to grow.\u201c200 square? That is not small eh!\u201d A trace of astonishment flashed through the middle age man face as he said, \u201c200 square is also roughly a third of a mu. A mu is about 666 square. For a mu of Daohuaxiang rice, the harvest is roughly about 800 catty. 200 square can more or less harvest about 230 catty of rice. In that case, I will bill you according to 200 square. At Xiangjiang, the places with good efficiency can mature the rice 3 times a year. That\u2019s right, mister, are you intending to grow the rice in the coming days? We also have the seedlings of Daohuaxiang rice here. After buying the seedlings, you can straight away plant it at your land. The goods are all 100% guaranteed to be real, just that the price is slightly expensive.\u201d(\u4ea9:mu \u2013 One fifteenth of a hectare.)\u201cI will take the seedlings then, the price doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cAlright, I will give you the quantity of 200 square then.\u201d The middle age man nodded his head and said.\u201cOther than rice, I also want some wheat seeds.\u201d Zhang Han thought and said.\u201cYou also want wheat? What kind of brand? How many quantity?\u201d The middle age man\u2019s brows lighted up.Five minutes later, the middle age man wrote down another bill for 200 square of wheat seeds.\u201cI also need some corn seeds.\u201d Zhang Han opened his mouth and said.\u201cCorn? For corn, there are ordinary corn, sweet corn and sticky corn\u2026\u2026\u201dThe middle age man opened another bill for all 3 kinds of corn. The quantity was much lesser, roughly for around 50 square.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - Grandma Liu Entering Grand View GardenPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI also want some soybean seeds.\u201d Zhang Han added.\u201cAlright boss\u2026\u2026\u201dThe smile on the middle aged man became much denser. He originally thought that Zhang Han was a small customer and didn\u2019t expect that Zhang Han was actually a big customer.The youth in front of him not only bought a lot, but he also picked the best seeds to buy. Seems like he is the kind of people that enjoy eating green ingredients.Zhang Han requested a total of four kinds of crop. Zhang Han intends to plant those crops today. Anymore crops and he would also not have the time to deal with it.Whatsmore, you cannot eat till your fat in one single breath. The range of the domain was very big, and the number of things that were intended to be planted was quite a lot too, so it was not possible to finish planting everything that Zhang Han wanted in a single day.After telling the middle aged man to give him a call when he has finished preparing, Zhang Han left the place.Returning back to the car, Meng Meng was still using Zhang Han\u2019s phone to watch cartoon at the backseat.\u201cDaddy, what took you so long.\u201d Meng Meng pouted her mouth and said.\u201cDaddy bought some ingredients that we will be eating in the future. Daddy picked the ingredients relatively seriously, thus came back a bit later.\u201d Zhang Han sat in the driver seat and said with a smile.\u201cBut\u2026you took too\u2026too long. Meng Meng waited until she was not happy.\u201d Meng Meng said in her small voice.\u201cThen how about daddy bring you to the beach to play?\u201d Zhang Han took the phone back and asked with a slight smile.\u201cBeach? Alright, go play at the beach!\u201d No matter where it was, as long as it was going together with Zhang Han to play, Meng Meng would be very happy.Meng Meng was currently three and a half years old. In the past, she had never come into contact with her father and had also never talked on the phone with Zhang Han. Thus, she was full of expectation towards a father\u2019s love.After meeting with Zhang Han, although she was not really happy during the first two days, and even felt a bit grievance. But ever since after that car racing, Zhang Han had been a qualified good father, and Meng Meng was also more dependent on him.If the position was changed, whereby it was Zhang Han who raised Meng Meng for a few years, and the little princess suddenly met her mother, the little princess would also most likely want to be with her mother constantly.After driving for about 20 minutes, they had arrived at Crescent Gulf. After parking the car, Zhang Han carried Meng Meng and walked towards the beach that was at Crescent Gulf.Crescent Gulf, nicknamed as the number one gulf under the heaven. The scenery of the beach here was very beautiful and was one of the big traveling spots in Xiangjiang.When they were preparing to go to the beach, Zhang Han tied a ponytail for Meng Meng.Meng Meng\u2019s hair just barely did not go over her cheeks and her fringe was right above her brows. When leaving the house, Zhang Han did not help Meng Meng groom her hair, thus Meng Meng left the house with a somewhat messy bob hair.Zhang Han was worried that Meng Meng would feel hot when they were at the beach, thus he casually took out a rubber band, gathered all of Meng Meng\u2019s hair upwards and tied the hair with the rubber band.Immediately, a messy pigtail that was like a crest was tied. Fortunately, Meng Meng was good-looking, if not, there was no way she would be able to dominate this kind of strange hairstyle.After getting off the car, Zhang Han bought two swimsuits, then rented a parasol and two recliners.Bringing Meng Meng to the beach, there was a lot of people here. There was a lot of females, but there were much more males here. Slightly paying attention, it could be seen that the gaze of quite a lot of males was looking at the various beautiful females who were in their swimsuit.After playing at the beach for a while, Zhang Han brought Meng Meng to the recliner to rest.\u201cWah, what a pretty little child.\u201dThree people came to the recliners that were at Meng Meng\u2019s left side, two females and one male. When one of the females just sat down on the recliner, she immediately saw Meng Meng who was on the right side. The beautiful woman had an enchanting figure, wore a white color bikini, had an oval face and wore a pair of sunglasses.Meng Meng\u2019s exquisite face was just like the princess in a fairy tale, pretty to the point that it would attract fondness from others. Besides Meng Meng\u2019s messy hair, all else was extremely perfect.Upon seeing Meng Meng, the woman couldn\u2019t help but ask with a smile,\u201cLittle fellow, what is your name?\u201d\u201cMy name is\u2026Zhang Yumeng. My daddy calls me Meng Meng.\u201d Meng Meng answered.\u201cWhat an adorable name. How old is Meng Meng?\u201d The woman lied down on the recliner, used her hand to prop her head, and leaned sideways to look at Meng Meng.\u201cI am\u20263 years and\u2026a few months old.\u201d Meng Meng counted with her little fingers and said.\u201cPfft\u2026\u2026\u201d The woman couldn\u2019t help but laughed.Even the slightly obese woman and the short hair male who was 1.6m tall laughed too while saying \u2018what an adorable child\u2019.The white color bikini woman chatted with Meng Meng for a bit, then took a bottle of cold green tea from the tray that was at the side and passed it over to Meng Meng as she said,\u201cMeng Meng, big sister give you a bottle of beverage to drink.\u201d\u201cThank you big sister.\u201d Meng Meng smiled shyly as she stretched out her little arms to take the beverage.At this time, Zhang Han who was at the side opened his mouth, \u201cMeng Meng, don\u2019t take things that other people give to you.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dUpon hearing that, with a swish, Meng Meng pulled back her little arms and looked at Zhang Han confusedly.Zhang Han sat himself up, carried Meng Meng into his embrace and said, \u201cWe cannot take things that other people give to us. No matter if it is food or drinks, we won\u2019t take it, understand?\u201d\u201cWh\u2026why?\u201d Meng Meng pouted her mouth and asked.Zhang Han thought for a bit, then replied, \u201cBecause, what if the food or drink that other people gave you had poison in it? Just like the story of Snow White, if Meng Meng ate the food and passed out, then wouldn\u2019t daddy not be able to see Meng Meng anymore?\u201dMeng Meng was shocked upon hearing that. She squeezed into Zhang Han\u2019s embrace and said,\u201cMeng Meng won\u2019t take things from other people in the future anymore then.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dJust when a trace of smile appeared in the corner of Zhang Han\u2019s mouth, the voice of the white bikini beautiful woman suddenly appeared,\u201cUncle, there is no need to go that far right? The cap of the beverage is not even opened yet. Aren\u2019t you too over-sensitive already?\u201dThe white bikini woman seemed to be at the age of around 22, and Zhang Han was but only 26 years old too. To be able to make the woman straightforwardly call Zhang Han uncle, it could be seen how dissatisfied she must be feeling.\u201cForget it Meng Qi. Good intentions being treated as donkey\u2019s liver and heart. Just ignore him.\u201d The slightly obese woman who was beside the white bikini woman lightly snorted and said.\u201cExactly.\u201d The moment the male who was with the two female opened his mouth, it immediately let others knew that he was a sissy. The male could be seen charmingly twisting his body for a bit as he curled his lips and said, \u201cMeng Qi, you are just too kind-hearted already. What do other people being thirsty or not have anything to do with you.\u201dIt was fine when this male did not open his mouth, but when he opened his mouth and Meng Meng who was originally not happy heard his eccentric tone of voice, she was thoroughly unhappy.Didn\u2019t even need to wait for Zhang Han to provide guidance, Meng Meng who was in her daddy\u2019s embrace said angrily,\u201cHumph! You\u2026you insects, don\u2019t bark in front of me and daddy!\u201dUpon seeing that, Zhang Han smiled and patted on Meng Meng\u2019s little head very encouragingly.\u201cOh?\u201d The sissy opened his eyes wide, looked towards Zhang Han and said while feeling dissatisfied, \u201cUncle, is this how you teach a child? With the way you are teaching, aren\u2019t you just going to teach out a little devil?\u201dAfter the sissy finished talking, Zhang Han\u2019s phone rang. The dialer was an unfamiliar number, it should be that the seeds he bought are ready to be sent over.Thus, Zhang Han carried Meng Meng and stood up. Before he left, he faintly took a look at the sissy and said indifferently,\u201cSo what if I taught out a little devil? When I Zhang Han do things, there is no need for me to explain to you.\u201dAfter Zhang Han finished speaking, he did not pay any attention to the three people who were opening their eyes wide and straightforwardly turned around and left, while at the same time picking up the phone,\u201cHello, send the things to Crescent Mountain\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026what kind of people is this!\u201d The sissy looked at Zhang Han\u2019s back and twisted his body around incessantly as he said, \u201cThis is angering me to death!\u201d\u201cPfft\u2026\u2026\u201d The slightly obese woman couldn\u2019t help but laugh.Even the enchanting woman who was called Meng Qi also couldn\u2019t stand his look and said with a face of dislike, \u201cCould you not be this lowly!\u201d\u201cAlright! You all are instead attacking me now huh?\u201d The sissy glared at the two female.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - crop cultivationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWoof, woof, woof\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing that there were strangers coming, Xiao Hei immediately started acting up.Ever since his body and bones had grown, he still has not gone out to show off. Right now, seeing that there were strangers coming, he naturally had to show off his fangs!When the pockmarked face male and the few other subordinates saw Xiao Hei\u2019s sharp fangs, they were scared pale and their legs couldn\u2019t help but retreat backward.While they were retreating, Xiao Hei slowly walked towards them step by step, with a gaze that was more ferocious than a wild wolf, displaying a look as if he was going to eat someone.This made the heart of the few people to raise up to their throat.\u201cBoss, boss\u2026\u2026\u201d The pockmarked face male looked at Xiao Hei with a terrified look as he softly called out to Zhang Han.\u201cXiao, Xiao Hei Hei\u2026\u2026\u201dAt this time, a small and cute voice rang out. The voice belonged to the little princess who had just finished drinking her nutri-express.Meng Meng could be seen stretching her out her little palm towards Xiao Hei.Xiao Hei\u2019s expression immediately changed, turning into an amiable expression. His big tail also started swaying around left and right as he stuck out his tongue and slowly moved his head towards Meng Meng\u2019s little palm.This kind of lively expression was just like the gif of \u2018\u4e5d\u95e8\u5927\u63d0\u7763\u2019 smoking that was on the internet.(Just google the Chinese words and go to image and click the 2nd image if you want to see the gif. That image is most likely the gif.)\u201cPhew\u2026\u2026\u201dThe pockmarked face male and the few subordinates let out a deep breath.\u201cBoss\u2026what kind of dog is this?\u201d The pockmarked face male asked cautiously, \u201cWill he bite people?\u201d\u201cHe is a normal dog. He won\u2019t bite people.\u201d Zhang Han slightly shook his head.\u201cIf that is the case, I can put my heart at ease. That\u2019s right, boss, is everything here planted by you?\u201d The pockmarked face male furthered himself from Xiao Hei and went to Zhang Han\u2019s side as he looked at the surroundings and exclaimed.\u201cEn.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head.\u201cWhat kind of grass is this underbrush? Even the soil also cannot be seen.\u201d The pockmarked face male asked curiously.\u201cNormal grass.\u201d\u201cAre those flowers cultivated out by you? Why do I feel like those flowers are different from the ones that are outside of this place?\u201d\u201cThere is nothing different, those flowers are also normal flowers.\u201d\u201cWhat tree is this? It is so pretty, I also want to plant this kind of tree.\u201d\u201cNormal tree.\u201dThe corner of the mouth of the pockmarked male face twitched slightly. He felt that the way Zhang Han spoke was too simple already.Not talking about others, just talking about the underbrush alone, if the underbrush were taken outside to sell, it was reckoned that people who want to buy underbrush would fight over it crazily. If those flowers were to be taken out, it was reckoned that pretty much just any person would like it. Also, this tree which could shock the heart of others, it truly made others felt intimidated just by seeing it.Before coming here, he had never once imagined that the existence of a tree that was just like the world tree that was within a game would exist in this world.\u201cIsn\u2019t this just too spectacular already?!\u201dWalked to under the tree, the pockmarked face male looked up at the Thunder-Yang Tree and let out a heartfelt exclaim.Standing right here and surveying the surroundings, there was nothing more beautiful that could be imagined.Meng Meng was playing with Xiao Hei. Zhang Han\u2019s tender gaze was looking at the little princess. After the few subordinates put down the seeds, seedlings and various kinds of farm tools, they started looking around at the surroundings.\u201cThis place is truly beautiful, it is just like the world within a fairy tale!\u201d One of the males who was a middle aged man shook his head repeatedly.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I have never seen such a beautiful place before in my life.\u201d\u201cCould it be that I have arrived in a paradise land?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.\u201d At this time, Meng Meng stretched out her little arms happily and said rather proudly, \u201cThis is Paradise Land. This is the Paradise Land that daddy build for Meng Meng!\u201d\u201cParadise Land that was built\u2026\u2026\u201d The pockmarked face male sighed, then looked at Meng Meng and said enviously, \u201cLittle friend, I really envy that you have such a powerful father. To be able to build out a place like this, this is truly impressive.\u201d\u201cHehehe\u2026My daddy is the most powerful, hehehe\u2026\u2026\u201d Hearing other people praise her daddy, Meng Meng was extremely happy as she raised up her little arms and jumped around.Seeing how happy Meng Meng was, Xiao Hei also followed and jumped around for a bit, displaying out an expression as if he was saying that \u2018I am a high-grade playmate\u2019.\u201cI even feel like not wanting to leave this place.\u201d The pockmarked face male shook his head bitterly. He looked towards Zhang Han and said, \u201cBoss, can I take a few photos here? This place is just too beautiful already. If I don\u2019t take a few photos, I will really regret it for my entire life.\u201d\u201cThat serious?\u201dZhang Han couldn\u2019t help but laugh, then waved his hands and said, \u201cGo ahead. However, don\u2019t tell others the location of this place. Without me bringing them, others who come here will be bitten.\u201dAfter Zhang Han finished speaking, Xiao Hei turned his head and looked towards the pockmarked face male. His gaze once again became ferocious as he opened his mouth and revealed out his sharp fangs.Seemingly as if he was saying, \u2018Those good teeth of mine are not used to bite people, but instead\u2026used to eat people!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe pockmarked face male\u2019s body trembled and he said while nodding repeatedly, \u201cSure, sure, I will definitely not say out the location of this place.\u201d\u201cEn, go on and take the photos then.\u201d Zhang Han nodded.\u201cThanks, boss.\u201d The pockmarked face male\u2019s face became happy. Taking out his phone from his pocket, he stood under the Thunder-Yang Tree and let one of his subordinates took a 360angle photo of him.After taking a photo under the Thunder-Yang Tree, he went to the underbrush to take a photo, then afterwards went to the flower area to take a photo. Even more, he wanted to take a photo with the adorable Meng Meng, however, he was too embarrassed to request something like that.It was not only the pockmarked face male who took photos, even the few other subordinates also took quite a few photos. In the end, after passionately bidding farewell to Zhang Han and Meng Meng, they then went down the mountain, while turning their head back every three steps.\u201cThis\u2026this is truly a paradise land! This boss is truly a godly person. If it was during normal times, I would totally not be able to imagine that someone would be able to build out such a beautiful place.\u201dStanding at the edge of the forest, the pockmarked face male took a last look at the beautiful scenery, then left reluctantly.At Crescent Mountain, under Thunder-Yang Tree.After playing with Meng Meng for a while, Zhang Han stood up and said,\u201cMeng Meng, daddy is going to go work for a bit. You can stay here and play with Xiao Hei first.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Meng Meng went into a daze, then asked, \u201cDaddy, where are you going to work?\u201d\u201cRight there.\u201d Zhang Han pointed to the paddy field at the mountain back and said, \u201cIt is about to reach afternoon already, the sun will be a bit hotter. You can just stay under the shade to play first.\u201d\u201cHmmm, don\u2019t want, I want to play at daddy\u2019s side. Eh\u2026Meng Meng doesn\u2019t feel that it is hot.\u201d Meng Meng pouted her mouth and said.\u201cAlright then.\u201dZhang Han smiled while shaking his head. Approaching afternoon, the temperature here at Xiangjiang was very high. Walking outside for a bit would cause one to sweat profusely.However, at Crescent Mountain, the temperature was basically maintained at around 23 degrees and the relative humidity was around 55%. This temperature and climate were where the human body would feel the coziest.Adding on with the fresh and clean air, and the beautiful environment, this place could basically already be counted as a vacation holy land for normal people.And all of this was possible because of Thunder-Yang Tree.Zhang Han knew that the temperature was fine, but the sunlight was still very intense. Staying under the sunlight would still cause one\u2019s skin color to become bronze color. Therefore Zhang Han subconsciously wanted Meng Meng to play under the shade.However, since Meng Meng was that clingy and wanted to follow along with him, Zhang Han nodded his head and agreed to it. It was 11am+ right now. To transplant rice seedlings to a 200 square meter paddy field, with Zhang Han\u2019s speed, it was reckoned that he would take about 2 hours.Whereas, a normal person would normally need 3 hours to transplant rice seedlings to q 200 square meter paddy field. Of course, with Zhang Han\u2019s current physique, if he wanted to be faster, he could finish transplanting the rice seedlings in an hour time. However, he did not want to do that because, firstly, he wanted to transplant the rice seedlings seriously, and secondly, he wanted to enjoy the country lifestyle.\u201cAiya,\u201dArriving at the paddy field, Zhang Han slapped onto his face and mumbled, \u201cI forgot to buy boots!\u201dNo matter how strict you were, there would always come a time where you would mess up. Even with how completely prepared Zhang Han was, when it was time to work, he still discovered that there was something that he had not paid attention to.\u201cForget it, I will go in with my bare feet.\u201d Zhang Han took off his shoes and socks, pulled up his pants, took the seedlings and walked into the paddy field.\u201cDaddy, daddy, do you need Meng Meng to help you?\u201d At the other side, Meng Meng who was sitting on the underbrush shouted out to Zhang Han.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u2026\u201d Seeing Meng Meng volunteering to help, Zhang Han laughed out and replied, \u201cDon\u2019t need, you can just play with Xiao Hei. Wait after daddy finishes planting the seedlings, we will go out to eat!\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dMeng Meng nodded her head obediently, then turned her head around and threw herself towards Xiao Hei who was lying down on the ground.Meng Meng\u2019s little hands continuously rubbed on Xiao Hei\u2019s head and body. Sometimes when Xiao Hei was scratched painfully, he also did not dare to move, being afraid that if he exerted any force, he would cause the little princess to be fling away.He could only bear with the occasional pain and continue playing with Meng Meng who was quickly turning into a little devil in his eyes. His eyes would take a look at Meng Meng from time to time, as he thinks to himself just when she would stop her ravage little hands!\u201cDon\u2019t move, Xiao Hei Hei, don\u2019t move.\u201d Meng Meng instructed.Xiao Hei\u2019s body stretched out as he lied down on the ground motionless.\u201cXiao Hei is so obedient.\u201d Meng Meng praised solemnly, then took a stride with her little legs and sat down onto Xiao Hei\u2019s body.\u201cSet\u2026set off\u2026\u201d Meng Meng raised her little arm and pointed forward as she said with her small voice.\u201cWoof\u2026woof woof\u2026\u201d Xiao Hei followed the way Meng Meng spoke, then stood up and walked forward.However, Xiao Hei\u2019s hair was extremely smooth. When he moved, Meng Meng\u2019s body slipped sideways.Seeing that Meng Meng was about to fall on the floor\u2026\u201cWoof\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Hei was scared to the point that his heart was pounding and his body was tingling. Glaring his eyes wide, he quickly turned his body around.\u201cThump!\u201dA light depressed sound. This was the sound of Xiao Hei\u2019s body falling onto the ground. His stomach was facing upwards, meeting with Meng Meng who almost fell down onto the ground.It was fortunate that Xiao Hei\u2019s speed was fast enough. In the end, Meng Meng fell down onto Xiao Hei\u2019s soft stomach and did not hurt herself.Previously, Xiao Hei\u2019s nerves were stretched taut, and even his breathing also stopped.When he saw Meng Meng landed onto his stomach, then was he finally able to feel relax.\u201cWoof\u2026\u2026woof\u2026\u2026woof\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Hei let out a few breaths as if he was relieved from a burden as he stuck out his tongue and had a helpless look on his face.This kind of humane expression, along with his body which was the twice the size of a Chinese rural dog, the Xiao Hei right now could truly be called a Chinese rural emperor dog already.\u201cYou, you, you are so stupid, Xiao Hei Hei.\u201d Meng Meng lightly snorted, then stretched out her little palm and pat onto Xiao Hei\u2019s belly.\u201cWoof, woof\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Hei shouted out two times with a grievance look on his face.At this time, Zhang Han who was transplanting rice seedlings at the paddy field laughed and said, \u201cMeng Meng, Xiao Hei is your friend, you cannot bully your friend.\u201d\u201cAh, I know, I did not bully Xiao Hei.\u201d Meng Meng stroke on the place that she just slapped on just now and said, \u201cWe are good friends. Xiao Hei, you say, am I right?\u201d\u201cWoof, woof\u2026\u2026\u201d Xiao Hei nodded his head solemnly.\u201cXiao Hei Hei, you, you quickly stand up, let\u2019s try again.\u201d Meng Meng crawled off from Xiao Hei\u2019s belly, stood up on the underbrush and instructed.Liked it?

    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 - It is time to learn a foreign languagePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAoowoo\u2026\u2026\u201d Xiao Hei shook his big tongue, turned his body around and lied down on the floor.After lying down on the floor and waited for Meng Meng to sit on his back, Xiao Hei started crawling forward. This time, Meng Meng did not slip to the side and began laughing happily.Seeing that, Zhang Han smiled slightly. His expression was very gentle. This kind of life, wasn\u2019t it what he had always yearned for?After looking at Meng Meng for a while, Zhang Han began to start working.Transplanting seedlings was simply planting the seedlings into the paddy field.Zhang Han\u2019s knowledge of growing crops was learned right before he was going to work on the paddy field. He knew about assembly line and also knew that the density for producing excellent quality rice was around 30cm x 20cm.Thus, Zhang Han reckoned the distance and planted the seedlings into the paddy field one by one.After 2 hours, the paddy field was filled with seedlings. It must be said that the professionalism of the seller was good. After asking Zhang Han about how big the paddy field was, the number of goods he packaged was just nice. Right now, only 4 or 5 more seedlings and the entire paddy field would be completely full.After finishing with the paddy field, it was already about afternoon 1 pm.Meng Meng\u2019s energy was exuberant, she was still continuously running around the underbrush with Xiao Hei.\u201cMeng Meng, let\u2019s go eat lunch first. After finish eating then we will come back here to play.\u201dZhang Han used the water of the paddy field to wash his feet. Taking a look at his own body, he immediately didn\u2019t know whether to cry or laugh.He forgot another matter, which was that he should have changed into another clothing for farm work. But after thinking about it, Zhang Han shook his head, it seems that he also did not have clothes to wear for farm work specially.\u201cDaddy, eh, what are we going to go eat? Meng Meng is currently still not hungry.\u201dEven though Meng Meng was already full of sweat, she still did not play enough with Xiao Hei.It must be said that, Xiao Hei was truly a high-grade playmate, being able to play crazily with Meng Meng. When Meng Meng slipped down from his body, he would rush forward in a blink of an eye to act as a pad for Meng Meng. Afterward, Meng Meng would purposely slip down from his body or when she was not able to catch up to Xiao Hei, she would make herself fall down on the ground.This truly made Xiao Hei extremely dazed. However, he also truly extremely likes to play with his little master.\u201cLet\u2019s go, daddy bring you to go eat western food.\u201dZhang Han tidied up simply, then walk over, carried Meng Meng and said with a smile.\u201cWestern food? Oh\u2026okay then. Then\u2026then are we coming back to play after finish eating?\u201d Meng Meng nodded her head obediently, then asked.\u201cEn, we will come back to play after we finished eating.\u201d Zhang Han smiled and kissed onto Meng Meng\u2019s cheek.\u201cAiyaya, it is all saliva.\u201d Meng Meng stretched out her little palm and lightly wipe her cheek.Actually, it was Meng Meng\u2019s sweat. After being kissed by Zhang Han, the sweat stuck onto Meng Meng\u2019s skin, making her felt ticklish.\u201cMeng Meng actually dislikes daddy already, daddy feels so sad.\u201d Zhang Han curled his lips and feigned a broken-hearted expression.\u201cHmmm, doesn\u2019t dislike, Meng Meng doesn\u2019t dislike.\u201d Upon seeing that, Meng Meng hurriedly moved her cherry lips over and kissed a few times onto Zhang Han\u2019s face, \u201cMuack, muack, muack, Meng Meng would never dislike daddy.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u2026\u201dZhang Han laughed out heartily without restraint. He felt that ever since he had the little princess, it seemed as if a sun had been hung up in the endless dark night, brightly lighting up the entire world.The dark night was Zhang Han\u2019s 500 years of loneliness, emptiness and other negative emotions, and Meng Meng was that bright sun which gentled his heart.After driving for 20 minutes, they arrived at a western restaurant named \u2018Bombana\u2019 that was at Crescent Gulf. Entering into the restaurant, the decorations was gorgeous and even the waitresses were all tall and slim foreign female.\u201cHello sir, welcome to Bombana, table for two?\u201d (\u5148\u751f\u60a8\u597d\uff0c\u6b22\u8fce\u6765\u5230\u9910\u5385\uff0c\u8bf7\u95ee\u662f\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eba\u7528\u9910\u5417?)(If I put Chinese words with bracket at the back, it means the language is being spoken in English in the novel.)A beautiful waitress walked up and said with fluent English.\u201cWhat are you saying? Do you know Chinese?\u201d Zhang Han asked.His English level was only grade 3 and a half. If someone was speaking English slower or spoke a simple sentence, Zhang Han would be able to understand. But if the person speaking English was speaking fast and all the sentence was stuck together, he would somewhat not be able to understand.Just by chance, two local middle-aged males walked by. After they heard what Zhang Han said, there was a trace of a sneer in their gaze when they looked at Zhang Han.\u201cJust a look and I can tell that he is a mainlander. To speak English is a characteristic of this restaurant. Entering the restaurant without even understanding the rule, only mainlanders would be able to do this kind of thing.\u201d One of the crew cut hairstyle middle-aged man used English to speak with his companion.\u201cTruly a disgrace.\u201d His companion also used English and mumbled.The both of them thought that Zhang Han was not able to understand what they were speaking about and spoke unrestrainedly. Even the beautiful waitress was able to clearly hear what they said. Hearing what they said, the waitress only smiled slightly.Zhang Han did not understand what they were talking about, but the little fellow in his embrace understood!With an angry face, Meng Meng pointed to the two males and said loudly with extremely fluent English, \u201cYou insects, don\u2019t bark in front of me!\u201d\uff08\u4f60\u4eec\u8fd9\u877c\u8681\u4e0d\u8981\u5728\u672c\u5c0a\u9762\u524d\u72ac\u5420\uff01\uff09When Meng Meng spoke, the expression of the two males froze and they quickly left with a somewhat red face.Speaking badly about others in front of them and being heard by them was after all not any good thing. Also, locals like them felt that children who knew how to speak English were children who had underwent higher education and would look highly on them.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Meng Meng?\u201d Zhang Han asked with a smile.\u201cThey are bad\u2026bad guys. They are talking badly about daddy\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng angrily told Zhang Han about what the two of them said about him.Zhang Han stroke Meng Meng\u2019s head and said with a faint smile,\u201cMeng Meng, those people, no matter how highly they think of themselves, they are but still insects, you don\u2019t have to pay attention to them. Let\u2019s go eat. Meng Meng is so powerful, to be able to speak English that well. When we are outside ordering food, daddy will have to depend on Meng Meng.\u201d\u201cReally?\u2019 Hearing that, Meng Meng immediately became happy, feeling that she finally had a chance to be useful in front of her daddy.\u201cOf course, Meng Meng you are the most powerful.\u201d Zhang Han smiled and rubbed Meng Meng\u2019s little cheek, causing the little princess to giggle and laugh.In the end, with the help of Meng Meng\u2019s translating, Zhang Han successfully ordered a relatively sumptuous western meal.When eating the western food, Zhang Han pondered to himself in his heart, seems like I will have to take some time to learn other languages soon.English, German, Franch, oppa, yamete, all of those, I have to learn it all.How could mere languages be a problem for the renowned Hanyang Immortal Monarch?After finish eating, Zhang Han brought Meng Meng back to Crescent Mountain.Meng Meng continued playing on the underbrush with Xiao Hei, while Zhang Han began planting wheat and other crops.Wheat was planted on a flat land. The process of planting wheat was to use a tool to sweep the soil to both sides, sprinkle the seeds, and then cover up the seeds. As for corn and soybean, both of them needed furrow. At the furrow, the seeds will be planted at the potruding area.On Crescent Mountain, Zhang Han was doing farm work, Meng Meng and Xiao Hei was playing at the side, causing a comforting atmosphere to linger at this Paradise Land.Imperial Entertainment Company, Zi Yan\u2019s office.\u201cBig sister Yan.\u201d Zhou Fei walked in from the outside and sighed as if she was relieved from a burden, then said,\u201cThat witch gave you some face in the end. Although the team that will be shooting the MV is not really that good, but in any case, a team has at least been set up. The final refinement of the songs has also been finished.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go to the recording studio then. We will go shoot the MV after we finish with recording the songs in the next few days.\u201d Zi Yan stood up and said.\u201cBig Sister Yan, there is no need to be this hurry right? You are also quite exhausted from those past few days, so how about we take a break this afternoon?\u201d Zhou Fei raised her brow and said.\u201cNo, we don\u2019t have much time. I heard that Xu Ruoyu is already rushing her MV. After finish recording the MV, there is still a need for manufacturing and publicize. There is not much time. Also, I want to quickly finish with everything and properly accompany Meng Meng.\u201d Zi Yan shook her head and said.\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhou Fei curled her lips and said with an approving tone, \u201cYou should really properly accompany Meng Meng already, if not that little brat who has no conscience is going to be snatched away by Zhang Han. You see, when you didn\u2019t allow Meng Meng to go out today, that Zhang Han just ignored and straightforwardly brought Meng Meng out. If this carries on, who knows what will happen?\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d Zi Yan took the lead and walked out. On the way, she lightly snorted and said petulantly, \u201cTonight when I go back I want to have a talk with him. Not even a few days and the guest wants to act as the host, dream on!\u201d\u201cDream on! Hehe, tonight I will chase him out!\u201d Zhou Fei had always been someone who loves watching shows and didn\u2019t mind big troubles. Hearing Zi Yan\u2019s words, she herself, on the contrary, had a smiling look.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When they were tired, they would sit on the ground to rest, and after resting enough, they would continue playing.\u201cAlright Meng Meng, the sky is getting dark, let\u2019s go back.\u201d Zhang Han washed his hands at the pond. Since his clothes were already dirty, he just wiped his hands on his clothing.\u201cDaddy, can we bring Xiao Hei back?\u201d Meng Meng asked with a somewhat small expectation.Just a day had passed and Xiao Hei who assumed the role of high-grade playmate had already captured Meng Meng\u2019s heart. Meng Meng had already considered Xiao Hei as her playmate and wanted to bring Xiao Hei back home to continue playing together, and also so that she would be able to share her toys with Xiao Hei.Hearing that, Xiao Hei immediately sat up and faced against Zhang Han as he shook his tail and stuck out his tongue, revealing an expression of him wanting to follow Meng Meng back home to play.\u201cEh\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhang Han smiled slightly and shook his head, \u201cThat won\u2019t do. Meng Meng, Xiao Hei still has to stay here to watch over this place. You see, daddy just finished planting that much ingredients, if someone were to come and destroyed those ingredients, we won\u2019t have anything to eat. We will come here again tomorrow to accompany Xiao Hei okay?\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d Meng Meng pouted her mouth and snorted lightly, \u201cAlright then.\u201d\u201cMeng Meng is so obedient.\u201d Zhang Han carried Meng Meng and kissed onto her tender cheek.\u201cXiao Hei, I, I will come back tomorrow. I will bring you toys and delicious food tomorrow okay.\u201d Meng Meng waved her small arm at Xiao Hei.\u201cWoof, woof\u2026\u2026\u201d Xiao Hei jumped around happily.Seeing that, Meng Meng started giggling.Zhang Han carried Meng Meng to under the Thunder-Yang Tree. After placing the farm tools and one side, he turned his head and took a few looks at the surrounding.The rice that was planted during the afternoon have already grown twice its size, and the wheat that was first planted have already grown out its green bud. The growth efficiency here was unreasonably fast.Of course, just think about it carefully and it would be understandable. The nutrients that those crops were all absorbing were after all the nutrients of spiritual soil and spiritual water. It would instead be weird if they were growing slowly.\u201cSeems like the crops would be matured within four to five days.\u201dZhang Han muttered to himself. At other places of Xiangjiang, those crops could be matured three times a year, but at Crescent Mountain, \u2018mature weekly\u2019 could be used to describe the situation. Furthermore, with the existence of spiritual soil, even if the crops were matured and weren\u2019t harvest, they would still be able to maintain their perfect condition.\u201cDairy cow, poultry, fruit, vegetables\u2026\u2026\u201dZhang Han was thinking about what else was still lacking, and a flash of light suddenly flashed in his mind,\u201cThat\u2019s right, sheep milk is also not bad. It is said that the nutrients of sheep milk is also very high, drinking it in turn with cow milk would be able to entirely replenish nutrients.\u201dZhang Han remembered that he drank sheep milk a few times before when he was small. The taste of sheep milk had a somewhat smell of goat meat.However, Zhang Han did not really understand about sheep milk, so there was no need to rush to get a sheep.Carrying Meng Meng down the mountain, Xiao Hei stood at the edge of the forest while having a somewhat slightly lonely expression because his big master and small master were leaving and he had to stay at the mountain alone again.Upon seeing that, Zhang Han\u2019s expression froze for a bit as he suddenly recalled of a sentence,\u201cIf you do not love, please do not harm, there are many important people in a person\u2019s life, but a dog only has his master in his entire life.\u201dDogs were faithful, it was so even in the Cultivation World.For example, fully grown dogs which were in the Gold Pill Realm like Snow Serene Dog, Three-Headed Dog, Burning Sun Dong and so on other dogs, once they have determined their own master, they would follow after their master for their entire life. In the Cultivation World, there were also a lot of touching stories of dogs who died protecting their master.Thus, Zhang Han was quite fond of dogs. Seeing Xiao Hei\u2019s look, Zhang Han muttered for a bit, then smile and waved his hand,\u201cXiao Hei, tomorrow I will bring you some little fellows to accompany you, you can go back first.\u201d\u201cGo, go back first.\u201d Meng Meng imitated her father\u2019s tone and said, \u201cGo back to your nest and sleep, I will come to see you tomorrow!\u201d\u201cWoof, woof\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Hei stood his body up, shook his head twice at Zhang Han and Meng Meng and started walking back. When he walked into the forest, he turned his body around and watched the car drove off. All the way until he could not see the car anymore, he then turned his body around and walked back towards the mountaintop.Driving the car back to Yunyin Garden, Zhang Han coincidentally met with Zi Yan\u2019s car at the entrance.Zi Yan\u2019s car was parked at the underground garage and Zhang Han\u2019s jeep was parked below the building.\u201cWhy are you in such a sorry figure?\u201dAt the front of the first floor elevator, Zi Yan took a few looks at Zhang Han and asked somewhat bizarrely.\u201cDaddy was working. Daddy worked for a day and planted many many things.\u201d Meng Meng stretched out her little arms and answered.\u201cOh my! My god! The down and out young master actually knows how to work? Wasn\u2019t it always him stretching out his hands and there would be clothes, open his mouth and there would be food?\u201d Zhou Fei couldn\u2019t help but ridiculed a bit.\u201cBad Auntie Fei Fei! You cannot talk badly about my daddy!\u201d With a solemn look, Meng Meng glared at Zhou Fei.\u201cTsk, little ungrateful fellow.\u201d Zhou Fei pouted her mouth and didn\u2019t open her mouth anymore. In her heart, she was indeed helpless towards this little fellow who was protective of her father.At this time, Zhang Han opened his mouth and answered, \u201cI planted some rice and wheat.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Zi Yan nodded her head.\u201cI won\u2019t be going up today. Meng Meng, daddy will come to pick you up tomorrow okay? Daddy will go buy some little animals today, that way, tomorrow they will be able to play with you.\u201d Zhang Han smiled and rubbed Meng Meng\u2019s head.\u201cNo, no.\u201d Meng Meng\u2019s smiling face immediately became anxious as she hugged Zhang Han\u2019s neck with her little arms, not willing to loosen her grip at all.To her, although she likes little animals, however when compared to Zhang Han, it was definitely Zhang Han who was more important. The little princess was incredibly attached to Zhang Han right now.\u201cDaddy, don\u2019t go, Meng Meng wants daddy to accompany her, all right?\u201d There was already grievance and choking in Meng Meng\u2019s tone.It was reckoned that if Zhang Han was to reject her, she would immediately start crying.\u201cOkay, okay, okay, your daddy is not going.\u201d Zi Yan rolled her eyes at Meng Meng petulantly, then looks towards and sighed lightly, \u201cYou follow us up. Just nice, I want to have a good talk with you later on.\u201dZhang Han nodded his head and carried Meng Meng into the elevator.It must be said that the mood of a child comes and goes quickly. When they were in the elevator, Meng Meng was still pouting her mouth, but when they left the elevator, Meng Meng once again had a happy look on her face.Having her father and mother accompanying her, Meng Meng was really happy.After walking into the house, Wang Juan greeted with a smile and helped to prepare the slippers for them. At this time, Zhang Han lightly patted on Meng Meng\u2019s little arm and said, \u201cDid you remember what daddy talk to you about during this afternoon?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dMeng Meng had a confused face and revealed out a pondering expression.Zi Yan, Zhou Fei and Wang Juan who was at the side looked at Meng Meng curiously, not knowing what she was thinking of.\u201cWhen you see Granny Wang\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhang Han reminded.\u201cOh, I remember!\u201d Meng Meng\u2019s eyes lighted up, pouted her mouth and looked towards Wang Juan as she said with her small voice, \u201cGranny Wang, I\u2019m sorry, Meng Meng, Meng Meng was in the wrong.\u201d\u201cPfft\u2026\u2026\u201d It was Zi Yan\u2019s first time seeing Meng Meng\u2019s this kind of adorable look and couldn\u2019t help but laughed out and asked, \u201cMeng Meng, what did you do wrong?\u201d\u201cI, I should not have call Granny Wang old witch.\u201d Meng Meng said in a low voice.Zi Yan\u2019s expression froze for a moment. Thinking about the origin of the word \u2018witch\u2019, Zi Yan turned her head around and rolled her eyes petulantly at Zhou Fei who was laughing secretly.However, what Meng Meng said next made Zi Yan\u2019s expression became stiff on the spot.\u201cDaddy, daddy said that, Meng Meng must respect people who treat Meng Meng well, and towards those who treat Meng Meng badly, I can scold them whatever I want. Also, also, there is one more sentence\u2026\u2026en\u2026\u2026you insects\u2026you respect me one foot, I will\u2026respect you ten feet, you\u2026you destroy a grain of mine, I will, I will destroy ten thousand dou of yours!\u201d Meng Meng pondered, then said out the sentence intermittently.In a moment, the place was quiet. Other than Zhang Han, the other 3 adults were dumbstruck.Wang Juan was somewhat dazed, not knowing what kind of education style this was. Zhou Fei first went into a daze, then start laughing at one side as she sighed in her heart at Zhang Han this down and out young master\u2019s formidable education.Whereas Zi Yan, her eyes gradually opened bigger, with her expression filled with fierce murderous aura, she looked towards Zhang Han and said with a fake smile, \u201cZhang Han, you come with me for a bit, I want to\u2026have a good talk with you!\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Zhang Han lightly nodded his head and placed Meng Meng onto the floor.\u201cUh-huh, I also want to go, I also want to talk together.\u201d Zhang Han followed Zi Yan upstairs, while Meng Meng ran slowly at the back.\u201cMeng Meng, you stay downstairs and wait for a while. Bo obedient.\u201d Zi Yan said with a somewhat strict tone.\u201cOh\u2026humph, smelly mommy! I don\u2019t like you anymore.\u201d Meng Meng pouted her mouth and said with an unhappy face.\u201cCome, Auntie Fei Fei play with you, let\u2019s not care about those two bad guys.\u201d Zhou Fei walked towards Meng Meng with a smile.\u201cHumph, humph, humph! You are the bad one, bad Auntie Fei Fei!\u201d\u201cYou! You this little heartless fellow!\u201d Zhou Fei\u2019s face became angry as she stretched out her hands and played around with Meng Meng.Upstairs, Zhang Han came to Zi Yan\u2019s bedroom.\u201cHow did you teach Meng Meng? As a father, how can you be that improper? Can you keep away that big young master temperament of yours? What was that about insects? What if Meng Meng said that outside? Won\u2019t Meng Meng be deemed as someone who has no inner quality and no education?\u201d Zi Yan wrinkled her brows and said coldly.Zhang Han took a few looks at Zi Yan and muttered in his heart.Why does this woman always seem to have eaten explosive whenever she speaks to me?Moreover, ordinary people are indeed insects, there is nothing wrong right?Zhang Han\u2019s outlook was very high. As someone who came back from the Cultivation World, and was a Tribulation Realm expert back then, his outlook was of course very high. Within the eyes of cultivators, there was really no difference between ordinary people and insects. This was not meaning that they completely despise ordinary people, but was that it was a fact!\u201cHow to educate Meng Meng, I of course understand.\u201d Zhang Han did not want to quarrel with Zi Yan and said with a calm tone.Liked it?

    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 - Buy a pet dogPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou of course understand?\u201dZi Yan sneered and said, \u201cNot mentioning about this matter for now, what was that all about during this morning? Don\u2019t you know how hot Xiangjiang is during the afternoon? Do you think that it is good to bring Meng Meng to that mountaintop to get shined by the sun and blown by the wind? When you look at Meng Meng\u2019s face which was filled with sweat, could you even bear it?\u201d\u201cThe temperature at Crescent Mountain is not high at all.\u201d Zhang Han answered calmly.\u201cYou are bluffing again. Zhang Han, you should at least have some basis when you try to bluff people right? The temperature in all of Xiangjiang is hot, yet only the temperature at your Crescent Mountain is not hot?\u201d Zi Yan said indignantly.\u201cYou will know next time when you come to Crescent Mountain.\u201d Zhang Han said calmly. Thinking for a bit, he then added, \u201cThe previous time you came to Crescent Mountain was during the night, so naturally you were not able to feel anything. You will know when you come to Crescent Mountain during the day. Furthermore, during the day at Crescent Mountain, you will be able to see things that are much more beautiful compared to during the night.\u201dZi Yan\u2019s expression paused for a moment, the corner of her mouth wiggled, with her tone becoming somewhat lighter, she said out a sentence, \u201cSo is this your invitation to me?\u201dBut Zhang Han said something which spoiled the mood,\u201cIt can be counted as my invitation to you I guess, whether you come or not depends on you.\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d Zi Yan glared at him for a bit, took off her cowboy jacket, revealing the white color small garment inside, which immediately highlighted her graceful figure. Sitting on the chair, she fixed her eyes onto Zhang Han and said, \u201cYou changed.\u201d\u201cWhat of me changed?\u201d Zhang Han sat onto the chair beside Zi Yan.Zi Yan took a look at his somewhat dirty clothes, then took a look at the chair which might have been dirtied. If it was someone else, she would definitely stop him, but towards Zhang Han, she did not say anything, but instead muttered for a bit, then slowly opened her mouth and said,\u201cYou were one of the four young masters in Shangjing back then. I heard about some things regarding you. My friends which were in Shangjing all said that you were aggressive, very haughty, would always cause trouble and beautiful women were constantly at your side.\u201d\u201cYoung and frivolous, just relatively childish during that period. that\u2019s all.\u201d Zhang Han shook his head.Remembered that there was this saying, the older generation would say towards the arrogant young generation, young people, don\u2019t be too insolent, and the younger generation would immediately retaliate, not being insolent, is that still called young people?This sentence spoke out many people\u2019s thoughts. Everyone all had a time when they were young. Young people were hot-blooded, sensitive, and paid extreme attention to the spirit of loyalty.When a friend was bullied, young people would immediately rush up and stand beside their friend no matter what reason, not considering any consequences that would come after. And as people grow older, people began to have bindings and would think before they did something. Even if they had the intentions to help, but if they did not have the capability, they would not take the initiative forcibly.Of course, there was no absolute in all things, there were still many adults who would be fired up all day long.Returning back to the topic, hearing Zhang Han\u2019s words, Zi Yan smiled slightly and said,\u201cLater on I heard that you had an accident and was driven out of Zhang Family. Originally, I thought that with your temperament, you would change a place to live at, but I never would have thought that you would obstinately stay at Shangjing, and even stayed for 5 years. Seems like you this young master still has his own backbone.\u201d\u201cThe things that I feel that I must do, no matter if I was to knock into the south wall, no matter if there was no turning back, I would still do it.\u201d Zhang Han faintly laughed.At this time, the atmosphere of the two people was somewhat subtle, seemingly like the first time of two friends having a heart to heart talk, but it appears that it was still really the first time that the two people have chatted like this.\u201cThat\u2019s right, you\u2026\u2026you were so popular back then, why did you choose to retire and give birth to Meng Meng?\u201d Zhang Han asked. He did not really understand Zi Yan\u2019s actions, because, in this era, it was very normal to have an abortion. Even when you go to the hospital to have an abortion, you would have to line up. And Zi Yan, who was immediately going to be able to achieve the title of best actress instead chose to give birth to the child. There was indeed a somewhat strange feeling.\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s expression paused for a moment, her expression somewhat desolate, she said, \u201cI\u2026\u2026I fell sick when I was small. The doctor said that I might not be able to be pregnant in the future, and if my luck was good, I could get pregnant once. That time with you\u2026\u2026after that accident, I found out I was pregnant later on. I had also thought of aborting the child, but I did not dare to gamble\u2026\u2026\u201dSpeaking up to here, Zi Yan did not continue speaking, and Zhang Han finally understood everything.\u201cWhy did you not tell me about it at that time?\u201d Zhang Han asked calmly.\u201cTell you for what?\u201d Zi Yan snorted and said, \u201cWe were but an accident, and we don\u2019t even know about each other, so why would I tell you? Even if I told you, do you feel that you would leave Shangjing?\u201dHearing that, Zhang Han remained silent. After a while, he nodded his head and said out one word, \u201cWill!\u201dZi Yan slightly went into a daze and did not say anything else. The room fell into silence.After a while, Zi Yan looked at Zhang Han and said lightly, \u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cEn?\u201d Zhang Han was confused.\u201cThank you for everything you did for Meng Meng. Ever since Meng Meng came into contact with you, she became much more cheerful and smiled much more happily. You\u2026you don\u2019t have a place to stay at during this few days right? You can stay here for the time being first.\u201d Zi Yan said with a trace of bashfulness.\u201cEn, don\u2019t mention it, she is my daughter.\u201d Zhang Han casually answered.\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s brows twitched, and said with a dissatisfied tone, \u201cHearing your tone, it seems that you want to have Meng Meng to your own? Let me tell you, Zhang Han, Meng Meng was raised big by my own hand, and you have only came into contact with her for a few days. It is impossible for you to try to snatch Meng Meng away from my side!\u201d\u201cWhy is the hole in your brain that big? When did I say that I was going to snatch Meng Meng away?\u201d Zhang Han said with an astonished face.Speaking with a woman was really a troublesome matter!\u201cThe tone in your voice just now obviously said that!\u201d Zi Yan glared at Zhang Han and said.\u201cI really don\u2019t know what to do with you. If you were not Meng Meng\u2019s mother, I would really be too lazy to even talk to you!\u201d Zhang Han slightly shook his head.\u201cI would be the one that is too lazy to even pay attention to you!\u201d Zi Yan snorted and said, \u201cQuickly go change out of your dirty clothes, it is uncomfortable just looking at it.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head, stood up and left.Zi Yan lightly snorted towards his back. After he left, she also went to look for her night clothes to change into.On this night, Zhang Han accompanied Meng Meng to play until 11pm again. Meng Meng only went to sleep after being urged by Zi Yan.The next day, after eating breakfast, Zi Yan and Zhou Fei went to work.This time when Zhang Han brought Meng Meng out, Wang Juan did not stop him anymore, and instead even saw them off to the door with a face full of smile, then took out a blue color circled shape elevator card and said,\u201cMr Zhang, take this elevator card with you, it will be more convenient when coming up and down.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhang Han kept the elevator card and nodded his head.Coming downstairs, after placing Meng Meng at the back seat, Zhang Han drove the car and left Yunyin Garden.\u201cDaddy, you are so stupid, you went to the wrong direction.\u201d Meng Meng looked at the surroundings of the street and said with her cute voice. She remembered the road well and knew that this was not the way that went towards Crescent Gulf.\u201cWe are going to buy some pets. Yesterday we promised Xiao Hei to bring some playmates for him.\u201d Zhang Han said with a smile.\u201cBuy pets, alright, alright! Aiya!\u201d Meng Meng suddenly cried out.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Meng Meng?\u201d Zhang Han asked with a smile.\u201cI, I forget to bring toys for Xiao Hei\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng said with an anxious and guilty face.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, we will go back home to take the toys alright?\u201d Zhang Han immediately drove the car to the left side, preparing to turn around and go back to Yunyin Garden.The little princess immediately became happy when she heard that and said repeatedly, \u201cAlright, alright, alright, daddy is the best.\u201dSeeing her attitude, if she was in Zhang Han\u2019s embrace, she would definitely give him a \u2018muack, muack, muack\u2019!Returned back to Yunyin Garden, the little princess picked 10 small stuffed dolls, then went back downstairs happily with her father.Zhang Han drove the car to a pet store which was called Pamper Pavilion that was located at the East District.The shop front of the store was not small. Inside the store was a hall of the size of 100 square. At the lateral side, there were some dog cages and cat cages. Inside those cages were some fully grown pets.Walking into the house, a somewhat strange smell could be smelled. After all, the pets were all in this house, thus the smell was unavoidable.\u201cHello mister, do you need anything?\u201d A 25 year old spectacled male walked up and greeted with a smile.\u201cBuy, buy pets.\u201d Meng Meng said in her cute voice.\u201cOh, such an adorable little girl.\u201d The male praised Meng Meng with a smile, then looked towards Zhang Han and said, \u201cNot sure what pet mister you would like to buy?\u201d\u201cBuy some dogs first.\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s gaze swept through the pets in the cages.There were quite a lot of different breeds of dogs. There were Alaskan Malamute, husky, Samoyed dog, Golden Retriever, Chow Chow, Poodle and so on others.Zhang Han was somewhat knowledgeable about the temperament and characteristic of those dogs.For example, he had raised before Alaskan Malamute and Golden Retriever. Alaskan Malamute was clever, extremely intimate to its master and had a very high obeying nature. Golden Retriever was famous for being docile, no matter if it was towards its master or outsiders, they were very friendly, and they were also very clever, when they saw that their master\u2019s expression was amiss, they would immediately lie down on the ground and act pitiful.And as for the other different breeds of dogs, Zhang Han also more or less knew what kind of temper they had. Back then when he brought his dogs out to walk, he would always come across some other people who were walking their dog too. After coming into contact with others for a while, he would more or less also understand the temper and characteristic of the other person\u2019s dog. Let\u2019s say the poodle who would fuck here and there for example. If it was possible, it was reckoned that it would even dare to fuck the sky.(Actually literally translate to fuck in the raw. Too lazy to rephrase and make it less vulgar.)(Context: Poodle seems to tend to climb onto other dogs and\u2026you know. Not really sure though.)\u201cNot sure what kind of dog mister you would want to buy? The dogs that we sell here are all roughly a year old and have all already finish taking 3 injections. We also have some purebred ones and have the certificate to prove it too, just that the price would be somewhat more expensive.\u201d The male said with a smile.\u201cWe are going to buy a lot a lot of dogs.\u201d Meng Meng blinked her bright big eyes and said.\u201cEn, we will roughly be buying dozen of dogs.\u201d Zhang Han added.The male slightly went into a daze, then immediately became extremely happy. Seems like he was going to be able to open a big bill today, thus he looked towards the female who was sitting at the counter and said, \u201cBig Sister Zhao, I will bring the customer to pick the dogs.\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201d The female nodded her head.\u201cMister, come this way, the small pets in our store are all at next door.\u201d The male took the lead and walked out.At next door, small cages could be seen inside. Within the small cages were all dogs that were a year old.\u201cMister, those blue cages that are at the inner side are all purebred. The label and price are all on the top side of the cage. The cages that are at the outer sider are all normal dogs.\u201d The male introduced.\u201cEn.\u201dZhang Han nodded and straightforwardly walked towards the inner side.In the end, there were still some differences between purebred and normal dogs. If not, the price of purebred dogs would also not be much more expensive than the normal dogs.No matter was it the build or appearance, purebred dogs were slightly better looking.\u201cThis and this.\u201d Zhang Han pointed at a male and female Alaskan Malamute.The male Alaskan Malamute was 8k and the female one was 8.8k.\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d The spectacled male\u2019s face became happy as he quickly took out the two cages where the male and female Alaskan Malamute were in and placed it on the aisle.Just those two dogs alone were able to be sold for 16.6k, and he would also be able to take some commission too.\u201cThis and this.\u201d Zhang Han pointed at a male and female pug.5k and 5.6k, another 10k rmb!\u201cThis and this.\u201d Zhang Han pointed at two Beagle.Liked it?

The male\u2019s face became much happier.\u201cThis and this.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201dEvery few steps Zhang Han took, he would point at two dogs.Zhang Han further on bought the shining white Bichon Frise, black and white intertwining Border Collie, Pomeranian, purebred Teacup Poodle which was worth 10.8k, sheepdog and poodle.Choosing up till here, they had already strolled through half of the place. Meng Meng who was within Zhang Han\u2019s embrace said somewhat anxiously, \u201cDaddy, daddy, it\u2019s my turn to choose!\u201d\u201cAlright, alright, it is Meng Meng\u2019s turn to choose. Look at this, this is known as husky, commonly referred to as silly husky. Huskies are much mischievous when they are small, and when they grow big, they would be much sillier instead. Husky also has a nickname which is \u2018disappear once let go\u2019, it is quite an interesting dog. Meng Meng, you can choose two of them.\u201d Zhang Han pointed at the 8 huskies in front and said.(Context of \u2018disappear once let go\u2019: Seems like when you let go of the husky\u2019s leash, the husky would always run off.)\u201cOh\u2026oh\u2026.daddy, they, they are all the same.\u201dMeng Meng hesitated for quite a while, not knowing which two to pick. In the end, she chose the two most active huskies in the cage that were continuously sticking out their tongue, wanting to lick her little palm.\u201cOh, this, and also this.\u201d Meng Meng pointed at the two most active huskies.\u201cMeng Meng, those two are both female dogs, you have to change one of them to a male one.\u201d Zhang Han couldn\u2019t help but smile.\u201cEh? What do we need a male dog for?\u201d Meng Meng did not understand.\u201cIf there is a male dog and a female dog, they would be able to give birth to baby dogs.\u201d Zhang Han stretched his hand out and pinched onto Meng Meng\u2019s cheek.\u201cAlright, alright then, is that one a male dog?\u201d Meng Meng pointed to the best-behaved husky among the huskies.\u201cCorrect, this one is a male. We will take this two then.\u201dAfter choosing the huskies, Zhang Han carried Meng Meng to choose the next different breed of dog.Small and exquisite Chihuahua, docile and adorable Golden Retriever, Welsh Corgi which has small legs, Meng Meng liked all of them very much. After choosing for a very long time, then did she finally managed to pick out two from each of the different breeds.However, when they reached the area where the dachshunds and Bull Terriers were at, Meng Meng\u2019s little mouth pouted and said,\u201cUh-huh, don\u2019t want, I don\u2019t want those, they look so fierce and not nice looking\u2026\u2026\u201dZhang Han smiled and carried Meng Meng to the back to continue looking. Seems like the dogs that they were followingly going to be buying were bound to be dogs that were adorable and attractive looking which little girls were fond of.At the back, they chose two Japan\u2019s purebred Akita which was worth 30k each, Japanese Spitz which had hair that was like snow, Samoyed dog, Shar Pei, and the aloof Chow Chow.\u201cRoughly those first for now.\u201d After finish choosing, Zhang Han turned his head around, took a look at the spectacled male and said.It could be seen, the male was currently excited to the point that even his hand was trembling. With a face full of excitement, the male said trembling,\u201cMister\u2026mister, you bought a total of 36 purebred dogs. The total\u2026total is 235.8k rmb.\u201dWhile speaking, the male looked at Zhang Han\u2019s expression both excitedly and scared at the same time, being afraid that the expensive price would cause this customer to give up on buying the dogs.\u201cEn.\u201dZhang Han could be seen nodding his head indifferently, having no billows in his expression at all, seemingly as if spending 200k was like spending 20 rmb.\u201cMister, how do you want to pay?\u201d The male asked excitedly.\u201cCredit card.\u201d\u201cAlright, this way mister.\u201dThe male brought Zhang Han back to the main store.The female at the counter took a look at the bill and immediately went into a daze.She totally did not expect that a bill alone would be able to sell out 36 dogs. 230k rmb, this was not a small bill!Thus, her smile became passionate in every possible way. After helping Zhang Han swipe his credit card, she said sweetly,\u201cMister, can I know where is your address? We will send the dogs that you bought to you in a little while. That\u2019s right, mister, do you need to buy some other things like pet foods and toys?\u201d\u201cToys?\u201d Meng Meng went into a daze for a while. Looking around with her big eyes, at the most left side, she discovered a row of cupboards where a bunch of dog toys was arranged. Upon seeing the dog toys, she raised her little arms and cheered happily, \u201cAlright, alright, buy toys! Buy toys for Xiao Hei and the adorable dogs to play!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go choose the toys.\u201d Zhang Han smiled and carried Meng Meng to the pet toys area.Meng Meng wriggled around within Zhang Han\u2019s embrace, hinting her father to place her down on the floor.Zhang Han placed Meng Meng down on the floor and with a woosh, Meng Meng went to pick the toys for the dogs.There were rubber ball, twine ball and so on other things.\u201cThis, this, and also this, I want them all\u2026Daddy, what do I do?\u201d Meng Meng began choosing the toys happily, not knowing which one to choose.\u201cWe will buy all of them then.\u201d Zhang Han laughed faintly.\u201cReally?\u201d Meng Meng\u2019s eyes lighted up.\u201cOf course.\u201d Zhang Han rubbed onto Meng Meng\u2019s head and smiled.\u201cWow, hooray, which this many toys, the doggies will definitely be very very happy!\u201d Meng Meng giggled happily.\u201cYou can buy a bit more then.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head, then looked towards the female beside him and said, \u201cThose few toys, give me 20 of each of them.\u201d\u201cSure thing mister. Because you bought that many dogs, those toys will be treated as free gifts. Not sure where you would like us to send the dogs to?\u201d The female asked passionately with a smile.\u201cYou can send them to Crescent Mountain. You all can start heading there two hours later. Before you all begin heading there, do give me a call first.\u201d Zhang Han said after muttering to himself for a while.\u201cAlright mister, can I know what is your phone number?\u201d\u201cXXXXXX\u201dAfter leaving his phone number, Zhang Han carried Meng Meng and left.\u201cYou are truly incredible. Your bonus this year is most likely going to be able to reach 5 digits.\u201d The female stuck up her thumb at the spectacled male.\u201cHehehe.\u201dZhang Han drove towards the livestock farm which was located at the South District. This was the second location that he wanted to come to today.Zhang Han originally wanted to buy some cats at the pet store, but after thinking about it, after spending 230k rmb, there was only 450k rmb left in his bank card. He still needed to buy some other things, thus he could only give up buying the cats for now.Of course, Meng Meng also thought of this problem, she suddenly exclaimed, then said, \u201cDaddy! We seemed to have forgotten something!\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Zhang Han laughed faintly and asked.\u201cEh\u2026\u2026those, those adorable kitties!\u201d Meng Meng reminded.\u201cKitties is it?\u201d Zhang Han shook his head and said, \u201cKitties will have to wait for a while first. We will buy the kitties after the doggies have grown up and become more sensible. If not, wouldn\u2019t the doggies and kitties fight every day?\u201d\u201cFight? Eh\u2026then, then let\u2019s not buy the kitties first, let\u2019s listen to daddy.\u201d Meng Meng imagined the image of the kitties and doggies fighting together, her complexion shrunk as she patted on her own chest and said.\u201cEn, don\u2019t buy the kitties first, we will go buy some other things first, like cow, sheep, pig, chicken, duck and goose.\u201d Zhang Han said.\u201cAlright, buy, buy, buy, let\u2019s go buy.\u201d The little princess said very happily.Spending money would let one feel delighted, no matter was it an adult or a child, especially females. Under the circumstances where one have money, spending money with no misgivings would always let one feel good.Although the things that they were going to buy next were not the toys that Meng Meng likes, she still felt very happy.After driving for about half an hour, they arrived at the livestock farm which was located in the South District. This place was not far from the house that Zhang Han just bought recently.\u201cWhat do you want to buy?\u201dThe person receiving Zhang Han this time was a 40+ years old middle age man.\u201cCow, sheep, pig, chicken, duck, goose, I am intending to buy a few of each, recommend me some relatively better ones.\u201d Zhang Han lightly nodded his head and said.\u201cWe want the most most most best ones.\u201d Meng Meng imitated Zhang Han and said.\u201cAlright, I will give you the best ones, pretty little brat.\u201dThe middle age man laughed brightly and said, \u201cThe best cow we have here is the Japanese Black. If the Japanese Black is fed well, there is a probability of it becoming Kobe beef. I presume that mister you should have eaten Kobe beef before right? A 500kg Japanese Black only have 6kg of grade A5 beef, and the price of each kg exceeds over 1.5k rmb.\u201d\u201cGrade A5 beef huh?\u201d Zhang Han muttered to himself.Zhang Han had of course eaten Kobe beef before. He remembered that he had seen before a piece of news that reported about 200g of Kobe beef being sold for the high price of 888. The output of Kobe beef was very less, but the taste was exceptionally good.And if this Japanese Black was fed well, there was a probability that it could become Kobe beef. What does it mean by being fed well?At Crescent Mountain, each and every Japanese Black could become Kobe beef, and all the meat of the cow would definitely be grade A5. Incorrect, the meat would be an existence that surpassed grade A5!No choice, the environment at Crescent Mountain was just that formidable.Eat rank 1 spiritual treasure meat grass, drink spiritual water, move about on rank 1 spiritual treasure sweet scent grass, and the soil underneath was actually spiritual soil. Growing up in this kind of environment, grade A5 beef was but a joke only.\u201cHow much does one Japanese Black cost?\u201d Zhang Han asked straightforwardly.\u201c8k rmb each.\u201d The middle age man replied.\u201cGive me 10 of this Japanese Black first then.\u201d Zhang Han said, \u201cRecommend dairy cow for me too.\u201d\u201cIf it is dairy cow, then it should be Holstein Friesian cattle. In a year, it can produce milk for 300 days, and there would be a dry period of 60 days. The 60 days is 2 months before the cow give birth. After giving birth, it could be able to produce milk for 300 days again. However, after the cow gave birth, artificial insemination will be needed for 60 days. A cow can be milked 2-3 times a day, with every time being 10-15 minutes. On average, a cow can produce 30kg of milk every day.\u201d The middle age man introduced.\u201cOh, give me 2 female cows and 1 male cow then. Separate the 2 months dry period of the female cows for me.\u201d Zhang Han muttered to himself for a while, then said.\u201cSure thing.\u201d The middle age man noted down, then said, \u201cHowever, I recommended mister you to buy only 2 female cows. When you need your female cows to receive sperm, you can just contact me again during that time. If you buy a male cow back, I\u2019m afraid you would also not know how to handle it properly.\u201d\u201cAlright, give me 2 female cows then.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head and said, \u201cIntroduce sheep and pig for me too.\u201d\u201cIf it is sheep, we have ordinary White Bighorn Sheep. The best sheep we have here is Ujimqin Sheep. If it is pig, the tasty one would be the black pig. At here, we have Taihu black pig which is quite good.\u201d The middle age man introduced.\u201cFor Ujimqin Sheep and Taihu black pig, give me 10 of each. Also, give me 2 dairy sheep.\u201d Zhang Han opened his mouth and said.\u201cAlright.\u201d The middle age man noted down again.\u201cGive me some chicken, duck and goose too. For the chickens, I want some chickens which can lay eggs.\u201d Zhang Han said.\u201cChicken, duck and goose\u2026\u2026I only have fully grown ones here, and they have all been fed fodder. I reckon that mister you would not want those. At the most inner side of this street, there is a farmers\u2019 market. There is a lot of home-reared chicken, duck and goose there.\u201d The middle age man said with a smile.\u201cOh, I will take all those for now then.\u201d\u201cLet me calculate for you. 10 Japanese Black, 2 Holstein Friesian cattle, 2 dairy sheep, 10 Ujimqin Sheep, 10 Taihu Black pig, the total is 198k rmb.\u201d The middle age man counted and said.Liked it?

    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 - Initial SizePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu198k rmb for 22 animals, approximately equivalent to 10k rmb for an animal.Furthermore, the animals that Zhang Han bought were young animals, if he were to buy fully grown ones, it would be more expensive.However, all those were things that he had to buy. Zhang Han had no concept towards money, there was never a time where Han Yang Immortal Monarch was in lack of money.Although he had just been reborn and was not rich currently, Zhang Han believes that it won\u2019t be long before he would be able to become extremely rich again.After paying the bill and telling the person the address to deliver the goods to, Zhang Han drove the car towards the end of the street.The time was currently 10 am. After driving for 10 minutes, Zhang Han saw the farmers\u2019 market. There was a lot of people at the farmers\u2019 market. Although the busiest period was over, there was still a lot of people entering and leaving the farmers\u2019 market. It seemed that it would require some effort to drive the car into the farmers\u2019 market, thus Zhang Han parked the car at the roadside, then carried Meng Meng and walked towards the farmers\u2019 market.All sorts of things were sold at the market. There were melon seeds, mineral spring water, clothes, pants, canvas shoes, cooked food, vegetables, and so on other things. The variety of things sold here was very wide.As everyone knows, markets have been circulated down from the ancient time up to this day and had never been cut off, just that, along with the gradual development of science and technology, the number of markets had also become much lesser.Compared to the younger generation, the older generation likes to go to the market more. After all, the market was a place that was linked to tens of years of their memories. Whereas the young people these days like to go to supermarkets that were diverse to buy their life necessities.\u201cThere are so many, so many grandpas and grandmas here!\u201d Meng Meng mumbled within her father\u2019s embrace.The little princess did not saw the stalls at both sides of the road, all she could see in her sight were adults that were walking.After walking into the inner side of the farmers\u2019 market for 5 minutes, Zhang Han finally saw the person who sold free-range chickens.This was a 50+ years old woman whose hair was ash-colored. The woman was currently chatting with the elderly lady who was in charge of the vegetable stall beside her.\u201cHow much is one free-range chicken?\u201d Zhang Han coughed lightly and asked.\u201cYou have a customer.\u201dThe stall owner was chatting enthusiastically and did not hear Zhang Han talking. Only after the vegetable stall owner reminded her, then did she turned her head around, took a look at Zhang Han and replied,\u201c200 rmb each.\u201d\u201cI want thirty.\u201d Zhang Han said.\u201cHow many?\u201d The stall owner slightly went into a daze.\u201cWe want thirty.\u201d Meng Meng replied for her father.\u201cThat many?\u201d A smiling expression appeared on the stall owner in an instant as she said, \u201cYou will have to follow me to my house to get the chickens.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head.\u201cEr\u2019ya, help me look after my stall for a while, I\u2019m going back home to get the chickens for him.\u201d The stall owner said, then brought Zhang Han towards the house area at the side.While walking, she looked towards Meng Meng and said with a smile, \u201cOh my, this child sure is adorable and pretty. Young man, you are truly blessed.\u201d\u201cHaha, she is my daughter after all.\u201d Zhang Han grinned and laughed.At outside, when others praise your own child, as a parent, one would feel very happy. No matter if the praise was real or formality, it was still nice listening to the praise.\u201cThis child is your biological child? Doesn\u2019t seems like it though?\u201d The stall owner sized up and down and said.Zhang Han\u2019s smiling expression immediately became stiff.What do you mean by that? Saying that I am ugly?The corner of Zhang Han\u2019s mouth slightly twitched as he said, \u201cShe is my biological child.\u201d\u201cEh, hahaha\u2026\u2026\u201d The stall owner also realized what she said didn\u2019t seem right. After laughing awkwardly, she said, \u201cThe child resembles her mother I suppose. Her mother must be really pretty.\u201d\u201cMy, my mommy is especially pretty! My daddy is also very handsome too.\u201d Meng Meng said with her small voice.\u201cYes, yes, your father is indeed actually quite spirited.\u201d The stall owner smiled and said.Following the stall owner to her house, the stall owner\u2019s house was like a siheyuan, there was quite a lot of free-range chicken raised at the back of the house.(\u56db\u5408\u9662: Siheyuan \u2013 A siheyuan is a historical type of residence that was commonly found throughout China, most famously in Beijing and rural Shanxi. Throughout Chinese history, the siheyuan composition was the basic pattern used for residences, palaces, temples, monasteries, family businesses, and government offices.)Zhang Han bought 30 female chickens and 1 male chicken. The chickens he bought were all fully grown. After bringing those chickens to Crescent Mountain, they could start laying eggs immediately. However, speaking of the constitution of the chickens, they were definitely not comparable to the chickens that would, later on, grow up at Crescent Mountain from when they were only chicks.However, Zhang Han also prepared to spend some capital. He intends to feed the dairy cows, dairy sheep and those chickens some Pure-Yang Water to improve their constitution. After thinking for a bit, he bought 30 chicks, At Crescent Mountain, their growth speed would be very high. In all likelihood, after the first batch of chickens had been eaten finish, those chicks would also have grown up.Zhang Han also wanted to buy ducks and gooses, so he asked the stall owner where he could buy them. With the stall owner guiding him, he bought 30 ducks and 30 gooses, with all them being young animals. The amount of Pure-Yang Water was limited and could not be used excessively. If not, Zhang Han could have just bought fully grown ducks and gooses and just fed them Pure-Yang Water.Because he knew that he could not swipe card, Zhang Han withdrew some money in advance. After finish paying, the stall owner found a truck driver. After placing the chickens, ducks, and gooses in the truck, the truck driver followed along the Jeep that Zhang Han drove and drove towards Crescent Mountain.After reaching Crescent Mountain, because there was only a truck driver that helped deliver the goods, Zhang Han had no other choice but to do the work himself.The fully grown chickens had their legs tied up and placed into a bag, and the small ducks and gooses were placed in a paper box.Making a few trips back and forth, Zhang Han placed the chickens, ducks, and gooses in their respective area.At the start, having arrived at an unfamiliar environment, they were running all around the place.Upon seeing that, Zhang Han waved his hand and called over Xiao Hei who was playing toys with Meng Meng.\u201cXiao Hei, come here.\u201d Zhang Han pointed to the respective area of the chickens, ducks, and gooses and said, \u201cThis is their place, don\u2019t let them run all around the place.\u201d\u201cWoof!\u201dHearing that, Xiao Hei\u2019s eyes lighted. It was time to act cool!Xiao Hei revealed out his fangs and ran out at the speed of lightning.Originally, there were some chickens, ducks, and gooses which wanted to go to other places, but they were scared stupid by the imitating Xiao Hei. After a few times, they all were conscious of their own living space. Although their living space was a circle formed by holly trees, but the size of this circle was just like the size of a small public square, which was big enough for them to play and move around as they like.\u201cDaddy, I am still waiting to play with Xiao Hei.\u201d Meng Meng played by herself at one side for a few minutes and saw that Xiao Hei was still not coming back and thus pouted her mouth and said dissatisfiedly.\u201cAlright, alright, Xiao Hei, you can go back and play with Meng Meng.\u201d Zhang Han laughed lightly and said.Hearing that, Xiao Hei grinned and once again let out a deep and low threatening sound towards the chickens, ducks, and gooses, as if he was saying,\u201cAll of you better be honest for me this Chinese rural emperor dog, if not I will eat you all!\u201dAfter howling finish, Xiao Hei turned around and ran towards Meng Meng. Xiao Hei\u2019s expression also immediately changed, the look on Xiao Hei was that of a very well-behaved dog. Right now, Xiao Hei had already realized that he must fawn his little master, as the little master had the most speech authority.Xiao Hei and Meng Meng played together, while Zhang Han sat on one side, took out his phone and continued learning a foreign language.The spiritual strength continuously converged at Zhang Han\u2019s head, enabling him to reach a state close to being able to remember something with just a look. Adding on with listening to some foreign spoken words, it caused Zhang Han\u2019s learning speed to be incredibly fast.The 2 hours of learning yesterday night and the learning in the morning had already made Zhang Han\u2019s English reached level 6. Seems like that a person whose English was level 8 would appear soon.Furthermore, after finish learning English, Zhang Han still intends to learn other languages. In front of Meng Meng, he must be multi-talented and proficient in everything!After learning for an hour, the delivery personnel of the pet store called Zhang Han\u2019s phone.\u201cMeng Meng, the pets that we bought have arrived, let\u2019s go and receive them.\u201d Zhang Han stood up and said.\u201cAlright,\u201d Meng Meng immediately stood up. She patted Xiao Hei\u2019s head and said, \u201cXiao, Xiao Hei, I picked lots of lots of little friends for you.\u201d\u201cWoof, woof.\u201d Xiao Hei barked out two times happily.At Crescent Mountain, it was boring if it was just him alone. How stifling would it be if others were not able to see such an almighty emperor dog? But it was all good now, with new companions coming, wouldn\u2019t he be able to show off how almighty he was whenever he wants? Wouldn\u2019t he be able to act cool whenever he wants?Arriving at the bottom of Crescent Mountain, the delivery guy was currently placing dog cage after dog cage at right beside the Jeep.\u201cOh my god, what is this thing?!\u201dThe delivery guy who was a youth suddenly saw Xiao Hei and was scared.\u201cDon\u2019t need to be scared, he won\u2019t bite.\u201d Zhang Han gave him a reassuring glance.\u201cHe really won\u2019t bite? Don\u2019t this dog seem to have grown too big?\u201d The youth said while feeling somewhat afraid.\u201cYou can be at ease.\u201d Zhang Han laughed lightly.After waiting 5 seconds and seeing Xiao Hei\u2019s haughty expression, which was just like that of an emperor who was overlooking the world and did not pay any slight trace of attention to him, the youth was then able to feel at ease.The youth took a few looks at Xiao Hei attentively and said, \u201cEh? This dog seems to be a Chinese rural dog, how did it grow so big? Chinese rural dog shouldn\u2019t be able to grow this big? Furthermore, it is even this pretty, what kind of dog is this mister?\u201d\u201cChinese rural emperor dog.\u201d Meng Meng patted on Xiao Hei\u2019s head and said.\u201cF**k! It is the first time that I have seen a Chinese rural dog have this kind of physical appearance, it is truly inconceivable. For a Chinese rural dog to be able to grow up this well, if this was spread outside, it is most likely that it would cause quite a stir, this is practically a miracle!\u201d The youth said with a surprised face.\u201cYou can let the dogs out of their cage and take back the cages, I don\u2019t need the cages.\u201d Zhang Han took a look at the dogs which were anxious to get out of their cage and said.\u201cEh? There is so many dogs here, if they were all let out, they would definitely run around, and just the two of us won\u2019t be able look after them.\u201d The youth hesitated and said.30+ dogs that were worth a total of 230k rmb, if a few of them were to actually ran away, just thinking about it would make one feel heartache.\u201cIt\u2019s all right, you can feel at ease and let them out of their cage.\u201d Zhang Han shook his head slightly and said.\u201cThis\u2026alright then.\u201d The youth laughed bitterly and walked to the cages.When he opened the first cage, inside the cage was a husky, famous for being \u2018disappear once let go\u2019. Upon leaving the cage, the little fellow ran towards one side happily.\u201cWoof!\u201d Xiao Hei\u2019s expression became fierce-looking.It was time to establish prestige!After barking one time, just like a lightning, he dashed to the front of the little husky in a few steps and bit towards the little husky.The sharp fangs caused the delivery guy\u2019s heart to jump.If the husky was to be bitten by those fangs, the life of that little husky would definitely be gone.However, the following image caused the youth to be dazed.The sound of thunder was big but the rain was small, Xiao Hei\u2019s fierce bite only held the little husky in his mouth. After holding the little husky in his mouth, Xiao Hei\u2019s shook his head and straightforwardly threw the little husky to the front of the cage.\u201cPlop!\u201dThe little husky fell onto the ground and rolled two times before standing up. Shaking its dizzy head, the little husky did not know just what actually happened.\u201cWoof, woof, woof!\u201dXiao Hei fiercely barked a few times towards the dogs that were in the cages, immediately scaring the dogs to the point that they were shivering and had an afraid look on their face.The youth looked at Xiao Hei with a somewhat stupefied and sluggish expression. Only after Zhang Han reminded him then did he came back to his senses and continued letting the dogs out of their cage.This time, the dogs were all honest and there was none that dared to run towards one side.Note: About just what dog Xiao Hei is, I swear to god finding out and confirming what dog Xiao Hei was extremely triggering because, in the raw, the name of what dog Xiao Hei is kept on changing, and there is also no direct translation of the names of the dog in English. After searching the google for quite a while, I have confirmed what dog that Xiao Hei is. So, Xiao Hei is basically a four-eyed Chinese rural dog, aka, in the raws, \u201c\u56db\u773c\u94c1\u5305\u91d1\u5c0f\u571f\u72d7\u2018 / \u2018\u94c1\u5305\u91d1\u571f\u72d7\u2019 / \u2018\u4e2d\u534e\u7530\u56ed\u72ac\u2019/ \u2018\u571f\u72d7\u2019. It is also written that Xiao Hei is a Chinese rural emperor dog, aka, in the raws, \u2018\u94c1\u5305\u91d1\u5e1d\u738b\u72d7\u2019, which is basically a non-existent species, adding the \u2019emperor\u2019 was most likely author way of saying Xiao Hei is special or something. Also, in a few chapters back, I wrote that Xiao Hei is a Tibetian Mastiff, which was wrong, and I have corrected it. So if anyone was confused about what dog Xiao Hei was, hope this helped.Liked it?

    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 - Stomach Stomach DiarrheaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMister, you have really raised a god-dog!\u201d Before the delivery guy left in his vehicle, he took a look at Xiao Hei and praised.30+ dogs, under Xiao Hei\u2019s prestige, all of them lined up properly and went to the pet area obediently. Only until Xiao Hei went to play with Meng Meng, then did they start running around.Fortunately, the pet area was very big and the dogs did not have any thoughts of running outside.After half an hour, the livestock were delivered to Crescent Mountain. The number of delivery personnel this time was 6, and even the amount of vehicles that were driven was 5 vehicles. When they delivered the livestock up the mountain, same with the previous batch of people, they were just like Granny Liu visiting the Grand View Garden and exclaimed in admiration for quite a while. After finish taking photos, they turned around and left.Zhang Han stood under the Thunder-Yang Tree and swept the surroundings with his eyes.At the livestock area, the fully grown free-range chickens were inside their house, fiddling with their nest, the small ducks and small gooses were playing around back and forth, running around the underbrush in a moment, swimming in the pond in another moment, and running to the meat grass which was at the left side to eat in another moment.The fully grown dairy cows were unhurriedly strolling around in its domain. The Japanese Blacks were relatively lively, continuously sizing up the new environment. The dairy sheep, Ujimqin Sheep, and Taihu Black pigs were strolling around in their own respective area.They all knew that the meat grass was their food. However, even if they did not know what the meat grass was, when they smelled the rather enticing smell that the meat grass emits out, they would not be able to help but go up to the meat grass and taste the meat grass.Fortunately, the meat grass was a rank 1 spiritual treasure, after eating finish, the meat grass would be able to mature within a few days. With this cycle continuing back and forth, there was enough meat grass to use.Looking at the planting area, the rice paddy was somewhat taller than yesterday, and the wheat, corn, and soybean were also growing rapidly. If the person who sold the seeds and seedlings was to saw this scene, he would surely be shocked.This kind of situation, only the word \u2018unimaginable\u2019 would be able to describe it. However, Zhang Han had long been accustomed to this kind of situation.Within Zhang Han\u2019s eyes, Crescent Mountain was not even really counted as a treasure land. If it was really a treasure land, how could it be this simple?The pet area was much lively, Meng Meng sat on the underbrush and threw the toys to the doggies.Within her embrace, there was a hairy Teacup Poodle, at her side, the 2 boot-licking Golden Retrievers snuggled up on her, the aloof Chow Chow lied down on the ground lazily, and the other dogs were gathered together, playing with the toys as much as they liked.Where was Xiao Hei?He, of course, could not let go the chance of establishing his prestige.Glaring with his eyes wide and surveying around the surroundings, Xiao Hei was just like an emperor looking at his own people.Every time when there was a dog who wanted to go to other places, Xiao Hei would first observe the dog, and when the dog was about to run out of the pet area, Xiao Hei would bark one time and rush towards the dog, bite the dog up, shake his head, and throw the dog into the air.Thump, thump, thump.The dog would drop down on the underbrush. Although it was not painful, the dog would also become somewhat dazed.Gradually, the dogs also became honest, and did not ran towards the area outside the pet area, and instead revolved around Meng Meng and played together.After Zhang Han finished looking at those, he nodded his head in satisfaction.Same with the plan, the domain had to develop slowly, and right now, the domain was already beginning to take shape.Soon after, Zhang Han picked up a milk bucket and filled it up with 2 liters of Pure-Yang Water. After feeding the dairy cows, dairy sheep and fully grown chickens True-Yang Water, Zhang Han came to the pet area and accompanied Meng Meng to play.Close to noon, Zhang Han brought Meng Meng down the mountain to eat, and at the same time go and take a look at the restaurant.Because the house was undergoing renovation, there was dust inside the house, thus Zhang Han did not bring Meng Meng inside and went inside on his own.Taking a look, the renovation was about to be finished.The vivid and lifelike lotus jadeite television wall had been completed, and even the surroundings of the lotus had been installed with color lights. When the lights were turned on, the image of the lotus jadeite television wall would definitely be extremely beautiful.The pattern on the roof was half completed, and the floor and wall had all been completed.\u201cMister Zhang, you have come.\u201d After Zhao Kai saw Zhang Han, he came up and welcomed Zhang Han with a smile.\u201cThe pace is pretty good.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head, feeling somewhat satisfied.\u201cOf course, since Mister Zhang you have opened your mouth, I definitely had to do the job well. In probably about 2 days, everything will be complete. That\u2019s right, Mister Zhang, about the board outside this restaurant of yours, do you want to also change it?\u201d Zhao Kai said.\u201cEn, I have to change it indeed.\u201d Zhang Han also forgot about this matter. Muttering to himself, he pondered about what name would be nice to name the restaurant.\u201cI have a relative who does boards. Mister Zhang, you can think of a name for the restaurant and I can make a board for you for free.\u201d Zhao Kai laughed while scratching his head.\u201cFor the name, it will be\u2026\u2026\u2019Meng Meng\u2019s Leisure Restaurant\u2019.\u201d Towards picking a name, Zhang Han had always been casual about it when thinking of a name.\u201cAlright, Meng Meng\u2019s Leisure Restaurant. Do you have any request for the color and font?\u201d Zhao Kai asked.\u201cNormal black and white will do. At the front of \u2018Meng Meng\u2019s Leisure Restaurant\u2019, add a cartoon design there. I will pass you the design later on at night. Make the board a bit more refined too, I will give you the money as per normal.\u201d Zhang Han thought for a bit and answered.\u201cAlright, I will have to thank Mister Zhang then.\u201d Zhao Kai laughed and said.After finishing this matter, Zhang Han drove the car and brought Meng Meng back to Crescent Mountain.Meng Meng very happily went to play with the doggies, while Zhang Han sat beside the little princess and learned English.Only using 3 hours, Zhang Han more or less finished learning English. Looking at a level 6 English video, he was able to totally understand the video, then looking at a level 8 English test paper, it was easy for him.Thus, Zhang Han began to learn another language.The entire afternoon passed by very quickly.Xiao Hei kept on moving around the pet and livestock area, waiting for his chance to establish his prestige and act cool. However, after a few times, the doggies and livestock all learned their lesson and Xiao Hei did not have any more chance to establish his prestige and act cool. Thus, Xiao Hei ran to Meng Meng\u2019s side, changed into a boot-licking expression and started playing together with Meng Meng and the doggies.All the way until the sky became slightly dark, Zhang Han then picked up the milk bucket and other tools and went to squeeze milk from the dairy cows and dairy sheep.After going through the purification of Pure-Yang Water, the physique of the dairy cows and dairy sheep had reached a perfect state, just like after Meng Meng and Zi Yan had drunk the Pure-Yang Water, their body\u2019s health had improved quite a lot and their immunity and other elements had also increased quite a lot.This was the benefit of Pure-Yang Water. When the milk was squeezed out from the dairy cows and dairy sheep, a very strong milk fragrance could be smelled.\u201cMeng Meng, it\u2019s time for us to go back. Say goodbye to Xiao Hei and the others, we will come back tomorrow to accompany them.\u201d Zhang Han carried 4 buckets of milk.2 big bucket and 2 small bucket, the big bucket one was cow milk, seemingly to be around 15kg, and roughly 30kg for 2 buckets. For the small bucket, it was sheep milk, with each bucket seemingly around 2kg each.The output of cow milk was relatively higher. A dairy cow could produce 30kg of milk in a day, by squeezing the cow each time during the morning and night. The output of sheep milk was relatively lesser, a dairy sheep could only produce 4kg of milk in a day.Returning back to the topic, after Meng Meng heard her daddy, she stood up and patted on her butt, then said obediently, \u201cAlright, we will come back tomorrow. Xiao Hei, and\u2026eh\u2026and everyone, goodbye, see you all tomorrow.\u201dAfter the little princess finished speaking, she ran to the front of Zhang Han and said with her small voice, \u201cDaddy, there are so many doggies, what should I call them each one of them?\u201d\u201cEh\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhang Han slightly went into a daze, after muttering to himself for a while, he said with a somewhat helpless tone, \u201cJust call them by their name I suppose. For example, the male Gold Retriever will be called big Gold Retriever, female Gold Retriever will be called small Gold Retriever, the male husky will be called big husky, the female husky will be called small husky, and so on.\u201d\u201cHehehe, big husky, small husky, so adorable\u2026\u2026\u201d Hearing that, MengMeng started giggling.Going back, when walking past the Thunder-Yang Tree, Zhang Han took out a mineral bottle and filled the mineral bottle with 500ml of Pure-Yang Water.A total of less than 10liters of Pure-Yang Water was only left with about 5liters now. It must be said that, the consumption speed was somewhat quick.Zhang Han drove the car and headed straight towards the direction of Tongluo Gulf.Before heading there, Zhang Han gave Zhang Li a call. When Zhang Han called Zhang Li, Zhang Li was preparing to go to work, but hearing that Zhang Han was coming over soon, she stayed at home and waited for Zhang Han instead.20 minutes later, Zhang Han and Meng Meng arrived at Zhang Li\u2019s house.\u201cHello Big Brother Zhang. Aiyo, what an adorable little girl.\u201d Li Anna ran over and opened the door. Upon seeing Zhang Han, she greeted him sweetly, and when she saw the little princess who stood beside Zhang Han\u2019s leg, she was really stunned by how adorable Meng Meng was.\u201cBrother, what is it that you are carrying? Milk?\u201d Zhang Li walked over and asked curiously.\u201cEn, the big bucket one is cow milk, and the small bucket one is sheep milk. All those fresh milk and for you all to drink. Before drinking it, you will have to first boil it yourself.\u201d Zhang Han placed 2 buckets of milk at the kitchen.\u201cAiyo! Brother, we still have some wandashan milk in the fridge, why did you went and buy milk.\u201d Although Zhang Li said that, but in her heart, she still felt warm. It was a kind of feeling of being cared for by your family.\u201cThis milk that I am giving to you is not any normal milk, this is milk squeezed by the dairy cows and dairy sheep that I am currently raising, how could it even be compared to some wandashan milk.\u201d Zhang Han laughed lightly and said, \u201cDon\u2019t treat it as something that is not good, this milk can\u2019t be bought by other people even if they wanted to.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really envious that Xiao Li has such a good big brother.\u201d Li Anna smiled slightly and said, \u201cBrother Zhang, she is your\u2026\u2026\u201dLi Anna pointed to Meng Meng and asked with hesitation.\u201cI, I, I, I am called Meng Meng, I am daddy\u2019s daughter.\u201d Meng Meng replied with her cute voice.\u201cDaughter?\u201d Li Anna slightly went into a daze, then laughed and said, \u201cBrother Zhang, you already have a daughter?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Zhang Han lightly nodded his head, then passed the mineral bottle that was in his hand over to Zhang Li and said, \u201cDrink it.\u201d\u201cWhat for? I am not thirsty.\u201d Zhang Li was confused.\u201cJust drink it when I am asking you to drink it. Quickly.\u201d Zhang Han squeezed the mineral bottle into Zhang Li\u2019s hand.\u201cQuickly drink it. Aunt, after drinking it, you will have to go to the toilet.\u201d Meng Meng blinked her clear eyes and said.\u201cAlright, alright, I will drink it.\u201d Zhang Li opened the cap. Originally, she wanted to drink two mouthfuls to deal with her overbearing brother, but who would have thought, after drinking the first mouth, she immediately wanted to drink another mouth.Gulp, gulp, in one breath, Zhang Li drank finish the entire bottle.\u201cWhat is this? Not milk? Why do I feel that this is even tastier than beverage?\u201d Zhang Li asked curiously.\u201cThis is diarrhea water.\u201d Meng Meng snatched first to answer.Zhang Li laughed and did not mind what Meng Meng said, but in the next moment, her stomach started rumbling!\u201cBrother! You actually gave me laxative? I, I will remember you for this!\u201d Zhang Li opened her eyes wide and shouted, then rushed to the restroom.Upon seeing that, Zhang Han smiled and shook his head. After saying goodbye to Li Anna, he carried Meng Meng and went down.20 minutes later.\u201cAiyo, why was there so much.\u201d Zhang Li walked out from the restroom dispiritedly.\u201cAh!\u201dUpon seeing Zhang Li, Li Anna screamed.Liked it?

    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 - Mengmeng\u2019s Leisure RestaurantPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat is it? You gave me a shock.\u201d Zhang Li rolled her eyes petulantly at Li Anna.Li Anna opened her eyes wide and ran to Zhang Li\u2019s side, then pinched a few times on Zhang Li\u2019s cheek.\u201cMy god, how did your skin became so much better? The mole on the left of your face is also gone too, just what happened? It became like this just after going to the toilet?\u201d Li Anna said with an astonished look on her face.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Zhang Li looked at her bizarrely and walked to the front of a mirror to have a look. Upon seeing herself in the mirror, her eyes also gradually opened bigger.Looking at her white and rosy skin, as well as the mole that had disappeared, an inconceivable expression filled Zhang Li\u2019s eyes.\u201cOh my god, what happened? Could it be, could it be that diarrhea water?\u201d Zhang Li exclaimed.\u201cIt is definitely that water! That water is definitely a good thing. Xiao Li, you, you\u2026\u2026\u201d Li Anna suddenly became somewhat shy and said softly, \u201cCan you ask Brother Zhang to also give me a bottle of that water?\u201d\u201cLet me ask.\u2019 Zhang Li quickly took out her phone.When the call went through, Zhang Han had just reached Yunyin Garden.\u201cBrother! What is that water that you just gave me drank?\u201d Zhang Li asked loudly.\u201cIt is definitely something good. If not, could your brother have given you ordinary water to drink?\u201d Zhang Han laughed lightly and said.\u201cThat water is that good? Being able to make my skin become good, and also make my mole disappear? Is it true or fake?\u201d Zhang Li somewhat did not dare to believe it. If not for seeing it with her own eyes, she would definitely not believe this kind of thing.\u201cAlright, whether it is good or not, you will slowly understand. Also, about the milk, although it is not as good as the water I gave you just now, it is also this world\u2019s best cow and sheep milk. There is nothing else right? I have to go up already.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cThere is nothing else. Oh yeah, that\u2019s right, brother, do you still have that kind of water? I want to give a bottle of that water to Li Anna.\u201d Zhang Li slowly said.\u201cYou think my water is Chinese cabbage? You still want to give it to people? There is no more, we will talk about it next time when I have it in the future. Alright, I\u2019m going up already.\u201d Zhang Han shook his head and immediately hang up the phone.There were only about 5 liters of Pure-Yang Water left now, how could he anyhow give it to other people?If Zhang Han had the strength of Tribulation Realm right now, and still he had that much treasures, casually giving Pure-Yang Water to other people for them to bathe in it, it was not a problem, but right now, all in all, he did not have those conditions.After going up, Zi Yan and Zhou Fei were currently sitting in the first floor\u2019s living room.\u201cMommy, mommy,\u201d Having not seen each other for a day, the little princess missed her mother very much. Running over happily, Meng Meng pounced into Zi Yan\u2019s embrace.\u201cDid you miss mommy?\u201d Zi Yan smiled and ask.\u201cI have, I have. Then, did mommy miss Meng Meng?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Zi Yan kissed onto Meng Meng\u2019s little cheek and said tenderly, \u201cI, of course, miss you.\u201d\u201cHehehe\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng laughed happily.At this time, Zi Yan saw Zhang Han who was carrying milk two milk buckets and walking towards the kitchen and asked somewhat curiously, \u201cWhere did you get the fresh milk?\u201d\u201cI bought dairy cows and dairy sheep.\u201d Zhang Han replied and walked into the kitchen.Fresh milk had to be boiled before it was drinkable. Upon seeing that, Wang Juan wanted to come over to help boil the milk but was rejected by Zhang Han. When boiling the fresh milk, the heat must be controlled well, and Zhang Han did not feel reassured to leave it to other people.Zhang Han took out a pot, placed it on the stove, poured the cow milk into the pot, and turned on the stove. While waiting for the cow milk to boil, Zhang Han stood at the side and looked at his phone, while at the same time looking at pot too.When the cow milk started boiling, Zhang Han immediately turned off the stove. After a while, he turned on the stove again, and wait for the cow milk to boil. Zhang Han stopped after repeating it 4 times.Boiling the cow milk like this was able to guarantee that the quality of the milk would be the most.During the period when Zhang Han was boiling the cow milk, the entire house was filled with a milk fragrance.\u201cThis cow milk seems to be quite fragrant? I have boiled fresh milk before in the past too, why wasn\u2019t there such a strong fragrance during that time?\u201d Zhou Fei closed her eyes and took in a deep breath, then said somewhat surprised.\u201cCould it be\u2026\u2026\u201dZi Yan squinted her eyes, as she thought about that bottle of magical water Zhang Han gave her to drink.After drinking the water, not only did my makeup disappeared, that day when I came home, Zhou Fei even looked at me for half a day because my skin distinctly became better. Could it be that the milk that he brought over this time is also a very good product?Zi Yan indistinctly became curious about Zhang Han. Why did after this fellow left Xiangjiang, he changed and somewhat started giving her a strange and mysteriously feeling.\u201cIt smells so good that Meng Meng is feeling hungry already. Daddy, daddy, Meng Meng wants to drink the milk.\u201d Meng Meng shouted out with her cute voice.\u201cYou can drink it after it has finish cooling down.\u201d Zhang Han laughed and answer.After the cow milk had been boiled finish, Zhang Han began boiling the sheep milk, immediately filling the entire house with a smell that sheep milk distinctly has.A bit of the smell of mutton odor, but the fragrant was still very strong, different from the pure fragrant of cow milk.This made Zi Yan and Zhou Fei who rarely drink sheep milk felt somewhat wanting to drink the milk immediately.Finally, after waiting for Zhang Han to finish boiling the milk, Zi Yan asked Wang Juan to quickly cook dinner.When eating dinner, each person had a glass of cow milk and sheep milk. All of them drank it very infatuatedly, claiming that they had never drunk such tasty milk before.After eating, Meng Meng, Zi Yan, and Zhou Fei played at the second floor\u2019s living room, whereas Zhang Han took a pencil and a piece of paper and sat at the side, and started to draw an adorable small cartoon design of Meng Meng.After finish drawing, Zhang Han took a picture of the drawing and sent it over to Zhao Kai, informing him to add this design at the front of the board. Zhao Kai replied an okay gesture to indicate that he understood.\u201cAiyo, the down and out big young master actually knows how to draw, this is truly unimaginable!\u201d Zhou Fei suddenly saw the paper within Zhang Han\u2019s hand and clicked her tongue in wonder.\u201cAh, daddy, why didn\u2019t you call Meng Meng to draw with you when you were drawing!\u201d Meng Meng placed the toy in her hand onto the floor, ran over to Zhang Han\u2019s side, grabbed over the paper within Zhang Han\u2019s hand and took a few looks at it.\u201cWhat an adorable little child, daddy drew it so beautifully.\u201d Meng Meng extremely gave face and exclaimed.\u201cCome, let mommy take a look.\u201d Zi Yan stretched her head over and took a look. Immediately, she laughed lightly and said, \u201cI must say, the drawing quite resembles Meng Meng.\u201d\u201cAh, is it Meng Meng? Was daddy drawing Meng Meng? Such a good looking little child is Meng Meng?\u201d Meng Meng ran to Zhang Han\u2019s side and asked with a face filled with expectation.\u201cOf course it is, you look at the people in this house, other than Meng Meng, who else is this adorable and beautiful?\u201d Zhang Han laughed lightly and stroke Meng Meng\u2019s little head.Now knowing that the smile of the 2 women became somewhat mild after hearing what he said.However, Zhang Han also did not care about those and started playing around with Meng Meng.After playing until 11 pm, Meng Meng went to sleep with Zi Yan.During the time in the next 3 days.Zhang Han and Meng Meng left early and returned late. During this period of time, at Crescent Mountain, Zhang Han planted some spring onions, potatoes, eggplants, tomatoes, green beans, garlic chives, big chilis, small chilis and so on other things.Also, Zhang Han would bring some fresh milk for Zhang Li every day, causing the fridge in her rented apartment to be completely filled with milk. Without choice, Zhang Li could only give some to her friends.In this 3 days, Zi Yan finished recording all her songs and was prepared to go to mainland to film the music video for her song.On that night, Zhang Han talked to Zi Yan about the restaurant\u2019s renovation being completed, and him wanting to bring Meng Meng over there to stay.Zi Yan pondered for a while, and upon seeing the incomparable expectation on Meng Meng\u2019s face, she agreed to it, and furthermore personally packed two big suitcases that were filled with Meng Meng\u2019s stuff.Because, she faintly felt in her heart that, this time when Meng Meng went over to Zhang Han\u2019s place to stay, it would probably be quite a while before Meng Meng comes back Yunyin Garden.Also, I myself am going to extremely busy until the 15th, so during this period of time, I will just let Zhang Han take care of Meng Meng I guess.During the night, Zi Yan and Zhang Han chatted again for a while, she told Zhang Han about every specific detail of how to look after Meng Meng.Evidently not very reassured towards Zhang Han this convenient father.After chatting till it was late, Zi Yan then went to rest.The second day, after Meng Meng said goodbye to her mommy, she followed Zhang Han downstairs with an excited face.\u201cMeng Meng, look and see what the board says?\u201d Zhang Han stopped the car at the front of the restaurant and said with a smile as he pointed to the board.\u201cEh\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng attentively and seriously looked at the board, then said somewhat hesitatingly, \u201cMeng\u2026Meng\u2019s\u2026Leisure!\u201d\u201cYou are correct, however, one word was still missing. What is the word at the front of the word leisure?\u201d\u201cEh\u2026eh\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng mumbled for a while, then said somewhat shyly, \u201cAiya, I don\u2019t recognize the word!\u201d\u201cWhat is this that we are opening?\u201d Zhang Han pointed to the house and said, \u201cWhat is the place that we eat food at called?\u201d\u201cRestaurant?\u201d Meng Meng seemed to have remembered. With her eyes lighted up, she said, \u201cMeng Meng\u2019s Leisure Restaurant?\u201d\u201cCorrect!\u201d Zhang Han laughed brightly.Upon seeing that, the little princess also started giggling, while saying, \u201cMeng Meng\u2019s Leisure Restaurant, hooray, it is my restaurant!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go in and take a look.\u201dZhang Han carried Meng Meng and walked into the house.The house was swept very cleanly. This was thanks to Zhao Kai who had specially looked for cleaners to clean the house after the renovation of the house had finished.Only after entering into the house then was one able to feel how beautiful the house was.The round dining table was surrounded by 4 crescent shaped wood carvings. There were 4 entrances, with each facing against the north, south, east and west. The wood carvings were openwork, and on the top of the wood carvings, there were all sorts of designs. Furthermore, the wood carvings were only half a meter high and were pleasurable to look at.At the right side, against the wall, there was a small stage. On the small stage, there was a black luxurious Steinway Model O Grand Piano. At the somewhat outer side place, there was a small bar counter. On the small bar counter, there was a white color Apple MacBook. At each corner of the house, a high quality sound system was set up.Looking at the inner side of the house, there was a small round table for eating snacks and drinking drinks. The ball chairs that were at the small round table were filled with a kind of characteristic. Whereas, the white color sofa and coffee table had a kind of family feeling.The most eye-catching was the television wall at the front of the sofa.The jadeite lotus on the wall was vivid and lifelike, and also very beautiful.However, Zhang Han\u2019s gaze was sizing up the kitchen that was on the left side. At the outside of the square shaped open kitchen, it was a bright white color. The entrance was at the inner side and there was a sliding door at the entrance. The stove and range hood was top grade brand. At the inner side of the kitchen, there was a customized oven, microwave oven, rice cooker, and steamer. At the bottom side was a cupboard to place the utensils.On the surrounding walls, 2/3 of the walls were filled with various kinds of flowers. On the upper part of the walls, which was the remaining 1/3 of the walls, there were 800cm x 800cm photo frames filled on the walls. Within the photo frames, the photos of some cartoon characters were casually placed in some of the photo frames. Zhao Kai knew that Zhang Han was definitely going to place his daughter\u2019s photos in the photo frames.With the boost of the house as a whole, even the 3 small white tables and 6 chairs that were situated by the left window also seemed to be of high quality.Comparably speaking, the second floor was somewhat lacking compared to the first floor. However, the style of the second floor was much comforting. Light blue wallpapers were pasted on all the walls. The sofa, television, coffee table and other furniture were also all chosen by Zhang Han himself, thus the standard of the furniture was naturally not low.Liked it?

    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - Go to supermarketPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSo good looking! So pretty!\u201dMeng Meng ran upstairs and downstairs a few times and said with an extremely excited face.\u201cThis is still nothing, wait until daddy finishes building Paradise Land, you will immediately know what place is the most beautiful.\u201d Zhang Han stroke onto Meng Meng\u2019s little head.\u201cDaddy is the best!\u201d Meng Meng stretched out her little arms and moved into Zhang Han\u2019s embrace,\u201cMuack, muack, muack.\u201d Meng Meng kissed quite a few mouths onto Zhang Han\u2019s face.\u201cHahaha.\u201d Zhang Han laughed without restraint.All those that he did, it was all for Meng Meng. Seeing that the little princess was this happy, a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment was filled within Zhang Han\u2019s heart.This piece of happiness was something Zhang Han never had even during the time when he had countless treasures.As it turns out, after having a child, everything was truly different. Towards this kind of life, Zhang Han was very fond and infatuated. Even so much that he doesn\u2019t want to think about other things already. Even if he was not able to cultivate to immortality, even if he was not able to search for treasures, it all didn\u2019t matter, as long as he has Meng Meng in this life, it was enough for him.\u201cDaddy, daddy, I want the toys that are in the suitcase.\u201d After running around for a few times, Meng Meng ran to the front of Zhang Han and said.\u201cAlright, alright, alright, I will take out your toys for you.\u201d Zhang Han laughed and shook his head.Opening one of the suitcases, within the suitcase, it was filled with all kinds of Meng Meng\u2019s toys, with most of the toys being hairy small dolls. Meng Meng placed some of the hairy small dolls at the living room and bedroom of both the first floor and second floor. Until that, no matter where she was, she would be able to stretch out her hand and grab onto her toy, then did Meng Meng leaked out a satisfied smile.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Meng Meng, daddy bring you to go to the supermarket.\u201d Zhang Han said.\u201cAlright, go to the supermarket! Hug hug, daddy carry Meng Meng to the supermarket.\u201d No matter where she went, as long as she was together with her daddy, Meng Meng would be very happy.Zhang Han carried the little princess, left the house and locked the restaurant\u2019s door. After driving for 5 minutes, they arrived at a supermarket that was nearby.After finish parking the car and just got off the car, there was a disabled person on the street that was at the lateral side of the supermarket. The disabled person lied down on a four wheeled skateboard, did not have both of his legs and only had 1 arm. There was a small iron bowl in his only arm, and within the small iron bowl, there were small changes.\u201cAh.\u201dMeng Meng who was within Zhang Han\u2019s embrace was shocked upon seeing that. Hiding her head at the side of Zhang Han\u2019s neck, she said softly, \u201cDaddy, why don\u2019t, why don\u2019t he have hand hand and foot foot, he is so pitiful.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid Meng Meng.\u201dZhang Han stretched out his hand and stroke onto Meng Meng\u2019s head and looked at that person indifferently.\u201cDo a good deed\u2026\u2026\u201d The male mumbled in a low voice.However, Zhang Han did not pay attention to him and straightforwardly walk past him.\u201cMeng Meng, we don\u2019t have to pity other people, because other people may not necessarily need pity.\u201d Zhang Han said lightly.\u201cBut\u2026eh\u2026he don\u2019t have any hand hand and foot foot\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng pouted with her small mouth and said.\u201cIt is his own matter that he doesn\u2019t have hand and foot. In this world, there is no pitiful people that became pitiful for no reason, therefore, if Meng Meng were to see this kind of thing again in the future, just don\u2019t pay attention to it will do.\u201d Zhang Han said unhurriedly.\u201cOh\u2026I understand.\u201dZhang Han carried Meng Meng and walked into the supermarket.The supermarket was a synthesis shopping mall, 1-6 floor was various kinds of clothes and jewelry, 7 floor was food, 8 floor was entertainment floor, and the supermarket was at the first layer underground.Taking the lift to the underground, at the entrance, there were a bunch of trollies. The trolley had a customized seat for little children to sit on, thus Zhang Han placed Meng Meng on the seat and began pushing the trolley and strolling around the supermarket.Oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar definitely needed to be bought. When heading towards the condiment area and passing by the snacks area, Meng Meng\u2019s eyes lighted up.\u201cDaddy, I want to eat that, daddy, I want to eat this\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng pointed to various kinds of fried potato chips and other snacks and said.\u201cAlright, daddy will take for you.\u201d Zhang Han smiled slightly and took 10+ bags of snacks in one go.In a moment, Meng Meng was extremely happy. Zhang Han did not doubt the slightest bit at all that if the little princess was in his embrace right now, she would definitely give him a \u2018muack, muack, muack\u2019 again!Seeing that Meng Meng still wanted to get more snacks, Zhang Han shook his head and said in advance, \u201cAlright, Meng Meng, snacks cannot be eaten too much, all those snacks are enough already.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Meng Meng slightly went into a daze. With her mouth pouted, she said in her cute voice, \u201cJust all those? Just those are not enough, not enough for Meng Meng to eat.\u201d\u201cWait after you finished eating those snacks, daddy will buy it again for you.\u201d Zhang Han stroke onto Meng Meng\u2019s little head.\u201cOh\u2026all right then.\u201d Meng Meng agreed reluctantly.The little princess was not like some brat who would cry when their parents did not buy something they wanted. Also, it was possible that it was because Meng Meng did not have a father since small. All the way until she was 3+ years old, then did she returned to her father\u2019s side now, so naturally, she treasured her father a hundred times more and was very obedient.Meng Meng\u2019s mood improved very quickly. After only a few steps, she started humming a song softly, with a very happy look on her face.Arriving at the condiment area, Zhang Han\u2019s gaze swept back and forth.He was clear about the condiments that he needed, but he did not know what brand to get.However, Zhang Han also did not bother about those, basically buying anything that was the most expensive.Oyster sauce, cooking wine, hoisin sauce, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, white vinegar, mature vinegar, ketchup, sticky chili bean sauce, dark brown sugar, white sugar, thirteen spices. Zhang Han took a few of each of every condiment.Staple food like rice and flour, of course, did not need to be bought, Crescent Mountain had the best rice and wheat in this world.Soybean oil, salad oil, corn oil and so on were also bought. Adding on some garlic, ginger, and other assisting ingredients, the condiments that Zhang Han wanted to buy was more or less all bought.Thus, Zhang Han paid the bill and brought all those things back to the car, then went back to the supermarket to undergo another round of purchase.This time, he was looking to buy kitchen utensils.Pots, bowls, ladles, and basins were of course absolutely necessary. For porcelain bowls and chopsticks, Zhang Han just bought a few, and for disposable meal boxes and disposable chopsticks, Zhang Han bought quite a few of them, intending to let the customer use it if there was any.In addition, for things like refrigerator magnets, wall stickers, broom, mop, towels, bath towels and so on other household goods, he also picked the best after strolling all around the supermarket.Right now Zhang Han was pushing the trolley to the counter.At the vegetable area that was at the front left side, a small boy who was more or less the same age as Meng Meng was also sitting in the trolley. The person who was pushing the trolley was a cold and elegant young married woman, and at the woman\u2019s side, an old man whose hair was ash-colored and seemed to be 50+ years old was currently picking bok choy.While the old man was picking, all of a sudden, his complexion became green and he seemed to be somewhat dizzy.Holding onto his chest with his right hand and panting heavily, he felt like coughing, but no matter what, he just wasn\u2019t able to cough. Just like this, as he kept on trying to cough, he collapsed sideways onto the floor.\u201cAh!\u201dThe female cried out in fear, \u201cFather, what happened? What happened? Father, please wake up\u2026\u2026\u201dThe female panicked and shouted out with fear, \u201cSomeone, save him please!\u201dThe staff members who were on the other side heard it and immediately ran over. A trace of anxiousness flashed across one of the manager\u2019s face as he said in a deep voice, \u201cDon\u2019t touch the old man\u2019s body. Pinch onto his philtrum point first and press onto his chest. Quickly, I will call the ambulance now.\u201dWhile speaking, the male took out his hand and dialed the ambulance hurriedly.2 staff members who were present started doing what the male said. One of them gave pressed onto the old man\u2019s chest, and the other person pinched the philtrum point. However, the person who was pressing onto the old man\u2019s chest evidently did not dare to use any force, cowering back and forth.The cold and elegant woman and the little boy started crying due to feeling too anxious.\u201cWhat should I do? What should I do\u2026\u2026\u201d Even if she was already a mother, right now, the cold and elegant woman did not know what to do at all.\u201cDaddy, hug hug.\u201d Feeling somewhat afraid, Meng Meng stretched out her little arms and requested Zhang Han to hug her.Zhang Han carried Meng Meng into his embrace with one hand and pushed the trolley forward with the other hand.\u201cDaddy, what happened to that grandpa?\u201d Meng Meng pouted her mouth and asked softly.\u201cHe perhaps fell ill.\u201dZhang Han replied.Although Zhang Han was only in the Qi Refining Realm right now, but through the contact of his hand, he could also transmit a little spiritual strength out and could help check the old man\u2019s body, and know just which part of the old man\u2019s body had a problem.But Zhang Han did not intend to meddle into other people\u2019s business.Within the depths of his pupil, there was an indifferent towards living being, as if saying, \u201cHis life and death is not related to me in the slightest bit.\u201dZhang Han had cultivated for 500 years and had seen too much of life and death. Ordinary people were just an insect-like existence. A high realm cultivator was able to destroy a planet with a palm. On a planet, there were countless people, and there was a lot of people who didn\u2019t deserve to die, but they all died within the hands of the high realm cultivator, all because their existence was as weak as an insect, and their life and death was merely within a thought of a high realm cultivator.Although Zhang Han did not do destructive things like destroying a planet, he had still seen quite a few of those happen.When Zhang Han was passing by next to the group of people, suddenly, the two staff members who were pressing the old man\u2019s chest and pinching the old man\u2019s philtrum point suddenly said in shock,\u201cHis breath is getting weaker and weaker, and his legs and hands are also starting to become cold, what do we do?\u201dHearing that, the manager\u2019s face turned pale, and he was feeling somewhat scared in his heart already. If the person was to die, no matter if the old man had any relation with him, he would also be affected by it.\u201cI am a doctor, let me take a look!\u201dA 40+ years old spectacled middle age man squeezed into the crowd and said.When he opened his mouth, the crowd hurriedly let out a path for him. The middle age man walked to the old man\u2019s side and squatted down. The middle age man pushed open the old man\u2019s eyelid and took a look at the old man\u2019s pupil, then felt the old man\u2019s neck and wrist for a bit. Lastly, he pressed two times onto the old man\u2019s chest.The middle age man\u2019s brows gradually wrinkled.\u201cHow is my father? Doctor, how is my father?\u201d The cool and elegant woman asked while crying.\u201cThe situation is not so good. The symptom could be heart and lung failure. If the ambulance does not arrive in 5 minutes, then\u2026\u2026sigh\u2026\u2026\u201d The middle age man shook his head and said.\u201cAh!\u201d The cool and elegant woman shouted out in sorrow, then started wailing.\u201cBoohoo, grandpa, grandpa\u2026\u2026\u201d The little boy that was sitting on the trolley finally understood that his grandpa could be passing away and started crying out with grieve. A solitary and cold atmosphere immediately filled the place. Light sighs could be heard coming from within the crowd time to time.Zhang Han carried Meng Meng and pushed the trolley forward.After walking a few steps, he discovered that Meng Meng was not moving at all and thus lowered his head and took a look. Immediately, he discovered Meng Meng who was on the verge of crying.\u201cMeng Meng\u2026\u2026\u201d The corner of Zhang Han\u2019s mouth paused for a moment. When he just opened his mouth, Meng Meng\u2019s little arms circled around Zhang Han\u2019s neck.\u201cDaddy\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng said while choking with sobs, \u201cDaddy, you have to be healthy, you cannot fall ill, Meng Meng cannot not have you\u2026\u2026they are so pitiful\u2026\u2026\u201dTears started falling down from Meng Meng\u2019s eyes, not because she was scared by the old man\u2019s state, but because seeing the little boy\u2019s sad look caused Meng Meng\u2019s mood to change.Little did anyone know, because of Meng Meng\u2019s tears, it saved the old man\u2019s life.\u201cDaddy won\u2019t fall ill, Meng Meng don\u2019t have to worry. Alright, don\u2019t cry, be obedient okay.\u201d Zhang Han stroke onto Meng Meng\u2019s head and muttered for a bit. Zhang Han shook his head and said gently, \u201cMeng Meng don\u2019t cry, how about daddy go wake up that grandpa? Alright?\u201dLiked it?

    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 - The idea of selling songsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOkay\u2026\u2026\u201dMeng Meng said pitifully.Zhang Han shook his head, placed the trolley at one side, turned around and carried Meng Meng towards the crowd.At the same time, Zhang Han slightly sighed in his heart.Meng Meng was still too kindhearted already. But it also still made sense, a person\u2019s first nature was originally benevolent, there was not a single person who was an evil person right after they were born. A person\u2019s growing environment and the kind of education the person had received had a very huge impact on what kind of person he or she would become in the future.Remember that there was a specialized organization who said that, from the moment when a child was born up to they were 7 years old, was the period where their temperament was basically decided. Thus, it was obvious that a child\u2019s education was very important when they were small.However, Zhang Han felt that if a person was too kind-hearted, then they would bemoan the state of the universe and pity the fate of mankind. To pity every pitiful person, then that would be somewhat over the top already. Seems like I still have to find a time to let Meng Meng take a look at society\u2019s true appearance.Zhang Han thought to himself while walking towards the crowd.Pushing aside people and squeezing into the crowd, the elegant and cool woman and her son were crying harder, and the complexion of the old man was also getting paler and paler.Even the 2 staff members also gave up on the first aid treatment and stood at one side helplessly.\u201cLet me take a look at him.\u201dZhang Han took a look indifferently at the elegant and cool woman, and not waiting for the woman to answer, after finish speaking, he placed one of his hand onto the old man\u2019s wrist, while carrying Meng Meng with his other hand.Spiritual strength moved from Zhang Han\u2019s vessels to his fingers, then penetrated into the old man\u2019s body and started swimming around.1 second, 2 seconds\u2026\u2026Finally, after 20 seconds, Zhang Han discovered the location of the abnormality.At this time, Zhang Han\u2019s expression was tranquil. Zhang Han stretched out his hand and place his palm onto the old man\u2019s chest, then immediately clapped downwards!\u201cBang!\u201dA dull sound rang out and immediately gave the entire crowd a shock.The old man\u2019s situation was already very terrible and this guy actually dared to beat onto the old man\u2019s chest with that much?Everyone did not understand just what happened and glared at Zhang Han who had a tranquil face.Even that cool and elegant woman was also somewhat dazed. Just when she was about to open her mouth,\u201cPfff\u2026cough, cough, cough\u2026pfff\u2026\u2026\u201dThe old man who was on the ground suddenly started coughing and phlegm was sput out from his mouth in quick succession.\u201cAh? Father, father, how are you? Father, how are you\u2026\u2026\u201d The cool and elegant woman was pleasantly surprised as she asked while shedding tears of joy.\u201cPant, pant\u2026\u2026\u201d The old man took a few deep breaths, and said lightly, \u201cAiyo, I felt so stuffy just now. I\u2019m feeling better after spitting out the phlegm. I\u2019m fine\u2026\u2026\u201dUpon seeing that Zhang Han saved the old man, the crowd couldn\u2019t help but start clapping. A bunch of surprised gazes was looking at Zhang Han and incessant words of praise could be heard coming from the crowd.Zhang Han did not have any expression, but the little princess within his embrace was extremely happy. On the little princess\u2019s face, an incomparably proud radiance sparkled, as if saying, \u201cLook, my daddy is awesome right?\u201d\u201cThank you mister, thank you mister.\u201d After the cool and elegant woman saw that the old man became well, she ran to Zhang Han\u2019s side and thanked him repeatedly, and said somewhat incoherently, \u201cI also don\u2019t know how I can repay you. Can, can you leave your contact details.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to repay me, I simply did not want to see my daughter\u2019s tears.\u201d Zhang Han shook his head and said indifferently, \u201cAsk your father to smoke less, eat lesser greasy food, and exercise when he has the time in the future. That way, perhaps he will be able to live a bit longer.\u201dAfter finish speaking, Zhang Han turned around and left while carrying Meng Meng, leaving the cool and elegant woman who had a complicated expression.\u201cWait, mister, please wait a moment.\u201d The middle age doctor who took a look at the old man just now ran over and asked lightly with a respectful expression, \u201cMister, how were you able to make out the old man\u2019s situation?\u201dZhang Han took a look at him and said indifferently, \u201cYou can try learning more about traditional Chinese medicine.\u201dAfter finish speaking, he pushed the trolley and walked forward.\u201cTry learning, learning more about traditional Chinese medicine okay\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng imitated Zhang Han\u2019s tone and said solemnly towards the middle age man.This sentence was, of course, a random sentence that he made up to deal with the middle age doctor. However, Zhang Han also knew that, if an experienced traditional Chinese medicine practitioner was here, they would also be able to make out the old man\u2019s situation.However, what Zhang Han did not know was that, because of this sentence of his, it caused that middle age doctor to become known as a highly skilled traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in several years in the future.When it was time to pay the bill, just when half of the goods had been scanned, the manager of the supermarket walked quickly towards Zhang Han.The manager decided that he would excuse Zhang Han\u2019s bill to express his gratitude towards Zhang Han. After the manager spoke some words of gratitude and the cashier had packed everything, Zhang Han nodded his head, carried the goods and left the supermarket.\u201cDaddy, you are my hero.\u201d Meng Meng said with a worshipping look.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhang Han laughed and used pure English to reply, \u201cDarling, I only want to be your hero.\u201d\u201cNo, no, no! There is also mommy too!\u201d Meng Meng pouted her mouth and said.\u201cAlright, I will count her too then.\u201d Zhang Han used fluent English to reply.\u201cEh? Daddy, how did you know how to speak English?\u201d Meng Meng asked, feeling puzzled.\u201cI learned it of course. For Meng Meng, daddy has to, of course, be an omnipotent daddy!\u201d Zhang Han replied with English.\u201cAiyo, daddy, you are already my hero.\u201d With an adorable expression, Meng Meng replied with her small voice.Zhang Han carried Meng Meng and walked towards the car while conversing using English.The number of people that were at the entrance of the supermarket was quite a lot. When those parents who brought their child saw that, those who knew English was still okay, while those who did not know English had a face of envy, jealousy, and hate.Seemingly, the grudging voice of a woman could be heard saying,\u201cLook at other people\u2019s father and children, then look at you two, one old food eater, and one small food eater. Only know how to eat, eat, and eat. Other than eating whole day, you all don\u2019t even do anything else!\u201dDriving the car and returned back to the restaurant, Meng Meng sat on the white sofa and played with her own toys, whereas Zhang Han prepared to tidy up the kitchen, and store the kitchen utensils after washing them. However, before doing that, he decided to first play some music. It was actually not bad to listen to music while working.Thus, Zhang Han opened the Apple MacBook, opened the KuGou software, and pressed the hot music radio station.Songs started playing. Zhang Han began tidying up the kitchen while listening to the music. As he listens to the music, his brows gradually wrinkled.What is going on?There was not much nice music within the hot music. More than half the songs that were played were not the type that Zhang Han likes, they were all somewhat overly raucous. Thus, Zhang Han stopped whatever he was doing and walked to the MacBook and started searching the songs that he like listening to in his previous life.He didn\u2019t know if he didn\u2019t search, but upon searching, he was shocked.There was no whatsoever data of many of the songs that Zhang Han likes. Even 2 of the singers that he relatively likes listening to also did not appear before, for example, one of the singers that did not appear was, the high pitch genius, Deng Qi.Furthermore, some of the songs that famous singers had written and sang by themselves had also not been released.Take this Joker Xue for example. Although songs like Ugly Child (\u4e11\u516b\u602a), Within Your Circumference (\u65b9\u5706\u51e0\u91cc), What Do You Still Want Me To Do (\u4f60\u8fd8\u8981\u6211\u600e\u6837), Animal World (\u52a8\u7269\u4e16\u754c), and so on other songs still existed, but songs like Actor (\u6f14\u5458), Serious Snow (\u8ba4\u771f\u7684\u96ea) and Ambiguous (\u66a7\u6627) were missing.It must be known that Serious Snow was one of Joker Xue\u2019s well-known song during Zhang Han\u2019s previous life. Also, the song, Actor, was even famous all over China and received a lot of fame.However, there were also some singers that Zhang Han had not heard of before in his previous life and was very popular right now. Furthermore, the songs of those singers were also pretty good.After picking here and there, Zhang Han chose 50 songs, with 32 songs being the songs that he like listening to in his previous life, and the rest of the songs being the songs of those singers that he did not know about.Zhang Han was satisfied with the quality of the songs this time. Thus, after playing the playlist he made, he went to tidy up the kitchen. While walking towards the kitchen, he mumbled,\u201cSince I, Han Yang Immortal Monarch was reborn on earth, to have caused the development track of the earth to become disordered a bit was also quite normal. Sigh, after all, my strength back then was just too high.\u201dTribulation Realm Cultivators was able to effortlessly destroy a planet with just their palm. Not talking about the earth\u2019s development track, even if a country was to disappear, Zhang Han wouldn\u2019t even be astonished in the slightest bit.\u201cActually\u2026\u2026I can sell the songs that have not appeared in this life to those singers.\u201d Zhang Han muttered to himself.Just nice that right now I don\u2019t have much money left. If anything was to come up, a few hundred thousand also seems to be not enough to use.\u201cWhat would be an appropriate amount to sell the songs for? Forget about it, since it is their songs anyway, each song for a hundred thousand will do.\u201dZhang Han decided after pondering for less than a minute.Little did he know that, in this age where pirating was rampant, 100k for a song was already counted as a high price. However, the songs that Zhang Han spoke of were all well-known and successful songs, and the value was far more than what 100k could compare to. Looking at the situation from a different angle, this price was also at the same time very cheap.After tidying up all the way until noon, all the things that Zhang Han bought were sorted out.Kitchen utensils, towels, and other products were all washed once. However, since there were no ingredients, Zhang Han decided to bring Meng Meng out to eat lunch.Just when they were preparing to leave, the first wave of customers came.3 formally dressed girls who seemed to be the age of 20+ years old walked into the restaurant curiously.They were attracted over by the board which had \u2018Meng Meng\u2019s Leisure Restaurant\u2019 written on it. They, of course, did not know that Meng Meng was the little princess\u2019s pet name and was curious as to why this restaurant was meng meng da.(\u840c\u840c\u54d2: Meng Meng Da \u2013 Chinese slang for adorable)In addition with after taking a look at the inside of the restaurant, the unique renovation and tidy and clean restaurant furthermore attracted them. Thus, they walked into the restaurant.\u201cBoss, what kind of meng meng food do this meng meng restaurant of yours have?\u201d One of the ponytailed girls asked with a smile.\u201cI, I am Meng Meng, the restaurant is not Meng Meng, I am Meng Meng.\u201d Meng Meng blinked her clear big eyes and explained to the 3 big sisters.(\u840c\u840c: Meng Meng \u2013 Meng Meng also means adorable.)\u201cOh, what an adorable little girl.\u201d\u201cWhat an interesting restaurant name.\u201d\u201cSo fun, it is the first time that I have seen a restaurant\u2019s renovation to seem just like home. It is quite warm.\u201dThe 3 girls laughed and said.\u201cWe are not open yet.\u201d Suddenly, Zhang Han opened his mouth and a splash of cold water was splashed.\u201cAh? The restaurant is not open yet?\u201dThe 3 girls went into a daze for a while, then pouted their mouth and left.Originally, they wanted to have their meal here and did not expect that the restaurant was still not open yet. Without choice, they could only leave while feeling sort of a pity.\u201cLet\u2019s go eat lunch.\u201d Zhang Han laughed lightly, carried Meng Meng and walked out of the restaurant. While walking, he asked, \u201cMeng Meng, what do you want to have for lunch?\u201d\u201cEat\u2026Eh\u2026\u2026Barbeque.\u201d Meng Meng thought for a while, then replied.\u201cAlright, we will go eat Korean cuisine then.\u201d Zhang Han smiled and brought Meng Meng out.After eating lunch, Zhang Han did not return to the restaurant and instead headed towards Crescent Mountain.Upon arriving at Crescent Mountain, Meng Meng happily went to play with the doggies. Whereas Zhang Han picked up the farm tools and began harvesting the rice. Zhang Han harvested 1/3 of the rice paddy. There would be more or less 50kg of rice after the rice have been processed. It was enough for them to eat for a period of time.Other than rice, Zhang Han also took some spring onion. Soon after, he came to the chicken coop. After a few days, there was currently about 100 eggs. The shell of the egg was very smooth and round and was 2 times bigger than normal eggs. If the chicken eggs were a bit bigger, they would be able to catch up with the size of a goose egg.Zhang Han carried the rice in succession to the bottom of the mountain. During the last trip, Zhang Han brought Meng Meng along.After checking the phone number of a truck driver, he called over a truck driver, then headed towards a food processing factory.Liked it?

Mister, where is this rice grown at?\u201dThe master who was in charge of processing the rice picked up a rice stalk and sized up the rice attentively.The more he looked at it, the more astonished he was. The outward appearance of the rice was very good.The connoisseur recognizes the artistry while the layman simply enjoys the show.The processing master had been working at the factory for a very long time and had processed a lot of rice, and had also seen before finished products that were very good. But, never had he before seen rice that was plump to this degree.The rice ear presented a gold color, and the rice grains of the rice connected to each other in succession, appearing very neat and tidy. Even without processing the rice, a faint rice fragrance could still be smelled. To the master, all those things were somewhat bizarre.Upon hearing that, Zhang Han shook his head and did not reply.\u201cThis is Daohuaxiang rice number 2 right?\u201d The master asked in wonder.\u201cEn.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head.\u201cAh, this is the first time that I have seen rice that has such a good physical appearance.\u201d The master exclaimed, then began operating the machine.However, after the rice was processed and grains of white smooth and round rice was processed out from the rice, the rice fragrance which could cause one to be infatuated made the processing master became more astonished in his heart.\u201cHow could it be this fragrant? Just how fragrant would the rice be after it had been cooked? This rice is truly dope!\u201d The processing master looked at each grain of rice and praised without ceasing.There was two sack of processed rice, with each sack being 30kg.\u201cWhat are those two sacks?\u201d Zhang Han pointed to the two sacks of fine power state thing and asked.\u201cThose are the rice husks that were processed out. They could be used as livestock\u2019s feed.\u201d The processing master said with a smile.\u201cI don\u2019t want the rice husks, you can have it. How much is the processing fee?\u201d Zhang Han said casually.\u201cSince you gave me two sacks of rice husks, there is no need for the processing fee.\u201d The processing master smiled and waved with his hand.The amount of rice that was processed out was very little and did not need much money anyway.\u201cEn.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head slightly, carried the 2 sacks of rice and walked out of the factory.Returned back to the restaurant, Zhang Han placed the 2 sacks of rice in the cabinet. The time right now has not even reach 4pm, and thus naturally, it was still not yet time to eat dinner. Zhang Han sat down for a while and suddenly remembered about him wanting to bring Meng Meng to have a look at society\u2019s true appearance.I almost forgot about this matter!After muttering for a while, Zhang Han had an idea. He remembered that a few days ago, he saw on the news that, at high grade clothing specialty store, some attendants would look down on those people who seemed very poor and mock and ridicule them.Let\u2019s wear clothes that are a bit damaged and bring Meng Meng to a high grade clothing specialty store!Upon deciding what to do, Zhang Han immediately sprung to action. Zhang Han went upstairs, took out a set of white casual clothes, and then took out Meng Meng\u2019s light blue cowboy outfit. Lastly, he took out a scissor from the drawer!\u201cSnap, snap, snap\u2026\u2026\u201dWith a few cuts of the scissors, the two set of clothes immediately became in tatters. There were different kind of holes in the shirt and pants. However, as the clothes were brand new, having holes in the clothes made it seemed as if a new style of clothes.\u201cIt will seem real if the clothes are a bit dirty!\u201dZhang Han took the two set of clothes and came downstairs.\u201cMeng Meng, let\u2019s go, daddy bring you to go out play.\u201d Zhang Han laughed lightly and said.\u201cAlright, go out play! Daddy, where are we going to play?\u201d Meng Meng asked happily.\u201cWe will go to Crescent Mountain first.\u201d Zhang Han carried Meng Meng and said.\u201cYay!\u201d Meng Meng stretched out her little arms and swayed her little arms around happily.Driving the car for 10 minutes, they arrived at Crescent Mountain. Meng Meng happily went to play with the doggies, whereas Zhang Han came to the side of a pond. Zhang Han rubbed the two set of clothes back and forth on the soil. After rubbing for a while, Zhang Han finally revealed out a trace of satisfied smile.Now, the clothes were truly in tatters and dirty. Not bad!After settling with the clothes, Zhang Han came to under the Thunder-Yang Tree. The growth of the heaven fragrant wood that was at the side was pretty good. The heaven fragrant wood was more or less as thick as a thigh and was close to 1.5m tall.After using a sickle to cut off 10cm of heaven fragrant wood, Zhang Han carried Meng Meng and went back to the car that was below the mountain.\u201cDaddy, we just arrived here a while ago. Meng Meng still hasn\u2019t played enough.\u201d Meng Meng pouted with her small mouth and said with an unhappy tone.\u201cWe will come back again tomorrow to play okay? Let\u2019s change our clothes, daddy will bring you to go experience the true appearance of society.\u201d Zhang Han changed his own clothes, then moved to the backseat to help Meng Meng change her clothes.\u201cAiya, daddy, the clothes are so dirty, Meng Meng doesn\u2019t want to wear it.\u201d Meng Meng was very fond of being clean, although she would always make dirty her own clothes.\u201cWe can only go play fun things after wearing the clothes.\u201d Zhang Han said.\u201cEh? What fun things?\u201d Meng Meng blinked her clear eyes, looked at Zhang Han and asked curiously.\u201cYou will know in a while. Daddy will bring you to go experience life. After experiencing finish, we will go back to the restaurant, and daddy will cook something delicious for you.\u201d Zhang Han laughed and said.\u201cOkay, okay then. But Meng Meng doesn\u2019t want to wear those clothes, those clothes are too dirty.\u201d Meng Meng pouted her small mouth and said softly.\u201cWe can only experience life after wearing the clothes. Come, daddy will help you wear the clothes.\u201d With a smile, Zhang Han helped the unwilling little princess to change into the dirty clothes.If Zi Yan was here, she would definitely reprimand Zhang Han this improper person. Other people\u2019s family would be the children being the naughty one, and in this family, Zhang Han seemed to have become the naughty one.However, \u2018if\u2019 was just a kind of reverie, and there was no way Zi Yan could be here.Zhang Han brought Meng Meng to Crescent Gulf\u2019s integrated shopping mall.\u201cMeng Meng, in this society, without money and power, other people will look down on you. When you wear like this and go buy clothes, the store attendants wouldn\u2019t even let you touch their clothes. You have to know that, in this world, aside from daddy and mommy who sincerely treat you well, other people could be fake.\u201dBefore entering into the shopping mall, Zhang Han said towards Meng Meng.\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201d Not sure if Meng Meng even understood what Zhang Han said, Meng Meng could be seen nodding her little head obediently.The stores in the shopping mall were all international brand, and everything that was sold was all high-end goods. Thus, the number of people in this shopping mall was not as much as a normal shopping mall.However, even though there were not that many people, Zhang Han and Meng Meng \u2018strange\u2019 appearance still attracted countless gazes. The gazes were either surprised, confused or couldn\u2019t help but laugh.Facing those gazes, Zhang Han did not mind the slightest bit at all.Towards the gazes of ants, why would an ant-eater care about it? And Zhang Han was equivalent to that ant-eater.Meng Meng, on the other hand, she did not understand that much. Blinking with her clear big eyes, she looked around the shopping mall, causing people to turn their head to look at her adorable look.After entering the shopping mall, Zhang Han straightforwardly walked into a Gucci shop that was close by.\u201cHello mister, welcome to Gucci. May I ask what kind of clothes do mister you want to buy?\u201d A 25 years old female shop attendant walked up and welcomed Zhang Han. When the female shop attendant saw Zhang Han\u2019s and Meng Meng\u2019s appearance, she first went into a daze for a while. However, her smiling expression was still kept on her face as she asked passionately.\u201cI will casually have a look around.\u201d Zhang Han replied indifferently as he carried Meng Meng and looked around the shop.\u201cThis shirt seems quite nice.\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s gaze swept the price of the shirt, 19.8k rmb. As he picked up the shirt and praised, while he was talking, he also observed the shop attendant\u2019s expression at the same time.Who knew, the shop attendant\u2019s expression did not change at all. Her face was just like a zombie, maintaining a sweet smile all the way. Even more, she passionately introduced to Zhang Han, \u201cThis shirt is very suitable for you mister. However, since mister\u2019s figure is very good, I reckon that most shirts would also be suitable for mister.\u201d\u201cHow much is it?\u201d Zhang Han intentionally held the shirt near to his own dirty clothes and measured it on his body for a bit. While doing that, his gaze was fixed onto the shop attendant, waiting for her to show an expression of impatient or dislike.\u201cThis shirt is 19.8k rmb.\u201d The shop attendant replied with a smile.\u201cDaddy looks good in all kind of clothes. Daddy is handsome.\u201d Meng Meng praised.\u201cIt is too expensive already, will 908 rmb do?\u201d Zhang Han bargained with an experienced look on his face.\u201c908 rmb?\u201d The shop attendant went into a daze for a while, then shortly after, she immediately hung up a smile on her face, and explained with a calm face, \u201cMister, I\u2019m really sorry, the price of the goods in our shop are all fixed. How about I introduce to mister you some other shirts that have a somewhat lower price?\u201d\u201cThere is no need!\u201dLooking at the shop attendant\u2019s zombie face which had a smile on from the start to finish, Zhang Han felt meaningless and defeated. Carrying Meng Meng, he turned around and left the shop.The female shop attendant shook her head while smiling and placed the shirt back.\u201cDaddy, why didn\u2019t you buy the shirt? Eh\u2026didn\u2019t we, we came here to buy buy buy?\u201d Meng Meng asked with a confused face.\u201cMeng Meng, we did not come here to buy buy buy today. The reason we came here today is to experience life.\u201d Zhang Han smiled.\u201cExperience what?\u201d Meng Meng was curious, not knowing just what kind of game her daddy wanted to play.\u201cEh, you will know in a while.\u201dAfter finish speaking, Zhang Han hastened his steps and came to the Dior shop that was at the opposite side.In less than 5 minutes, Zhang Han walked out of the shop with a helpless face.The shop attendant inside the Dior shop was the same as the shop attendant at the Gucci shop, having a smile from start to finish. Upon seeing that it was hopeless, Zhang Han left the shop.Taking a few steps forward, Zhang Han prepared for his next round of attack. The shop this time was a trend shop.After entering the shop, Zhang Han came out of the shop much faster this time. Within less than 3 minutes, Zhang Han walked out of the shop with a light sigh.The next shop, before 3 minutes, Zhang Han walked out of the shop with a rigid expression, and Meng Meng\u2019s expression was already somewhat confused.\u201cNext shop!\u201d Zhang Han took a deep breath, I don\u2019t believe it, are the inner quality of all the shop attendants this high?\u201cNext shop!\u201d\u201cNext shop again!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFinally, at the 15th shop, the shop attendant finally had a somewhat \u2018normal\u2019 reaction.\u201cMister, mister, your hands seemed to be somewhat dirty. How about I bring you to go wash your hands first before you touch the clothing. Is that okay with you?\u201d The shop attendant\u2019s expression was not that good. Slightly frowning, the shop attendant said with a somewhat urgent tone.Zhang Han\u2019s hands were indeed somewhat dirty and the clothing that he was about to touch was a white color fur clothing.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201dZhang Han immediately became spirited as he gazed at the shop attendant and said with expectation, \u201cYou said that my hands are dirty. Then, what will happen if I touched the clothing? Do you intend to force me to buy the clothing or compensate you all?\u201dAfter the beautiful woman said something like \u2018You, of course, have to take reasonability if you dirtied the clothing\u2019, Zhang Han was intending to have a good debate with her, and give Meng Meng a lesson.However, before the woman who was frowning slightly replied, a steady voice came from the other side,\u201cIf you touched it then so be it, we will of course not ask you to compensate, those clothes here are all sample clothes anyway.\u201dZhang Han turned his head around, and a capable and experienced looking woman who seemed to be 30+ years old walked up and said passionately,\u201cHello mister, this clothing is woman clothing, so I presume that mister you are buying it for your wife right? Seeing that your child is this adorable and pretty, her mother must also be very beautiful. Thus, I feel that this clothing will definitely be suitable for your wife. Mister, you can casually pick up the clothing and have a look at it.\u201d\u201cMy mommy is very beautiful.\u201d Meng Meng pouted with her small mouth and said, \u201cDaddy is also very handsome. Daddy, daddy, you have never buy clothes for mommy before, this clothing looks very nice, can you buy it for mommy please?\u201dHearing that, Zhang Han took a few looks at Meng Meng. In the end, he said with a somewhat helpless tone, \u201cI will take this clothing then\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the end, Zhang Han carried a brand new fur clothing and left the shopping mall.Zhang Han was not going to try anymore, he had admitted defeat. He felt that the plan today had failed already.\u201cManager, your eyes are indeed vicious. I really did not expect that person would be able to just casually buy the clothing that costs 28k rmb. In the start, I still thought that the person was just coming in to casually have a look.\u201d The shop assistant sighed repeatedly.\u201cI say, you have to learn a bit more. No matter what is it, you have to observe first. You look at that adorable and pretty little lady, do you think that a normal person would be able to give birth to such a child? With a look and I knew that the mister was just here to look for fun. People like this are normally big shots who really have nothing better to do. If you were to have deeply offended him, just think about what kind of consequence would follow you after on?\u201d The manager earnestly guided the shop assistant.\u201cManager, you are right.\u201d\u2026\u2026When they returned back to the restaurant, the sky was also becoming dark.Zhang Han was intending to prepare a meal for Meng Meng for the first time.Just when he was about to cook the rice, Zhang Han went into a daze for a while.\u201cMeng Meng, we have to take a trip back to Crescent Mountain.\u201d Zhang Han opened his mouth and said.\u201cEh?\u201d Meng Meng slightly went into a daze, then became overjoyed at the unexpected good news as she said, \u201cAlright, alright, go play with the doggies!\u201dThus, Zhang Han brought Meng Meng back to Crescent Mountain.The reason for coming back to Crescent Mountain was because Zhang Han thought of a matter, the water for cooking the rice!Zhang Han did not want to use tap water to cook the rice. After thinking about it, he decided to use spiritual water to cook the rice. Although the rice was already at the highest quality, although using spiritual water to cook the rice could be considered as decorating something that was already perfect, but Zhang Han just wanted to use spiritual water to cook the rice. Zhang Han was just this willful!Under Thunder-Yang Tree, Zhang Han\u2019s spiritual strength revolved, and connected to Thunder-Yang Tree, causing a branch to come out from the Thunder-Yang Tree. Like a tap, the spiritual water that was within the underground winding corridor shape cave flowed upwards and flowed out from the branch.Zhang Han filled 2 milk buckets with spiritual water, then called out for Meng Meng. The little princess was currently playing happily and did not hear Zhang Han\u2019s voice.Upon seeing that, Zhang Han let Meng Meng played for another 10+ minutes.The sun was gradually getting darker.Normally at this timing, at mountains where there were lots of underbrush, there would be quite a lot of mosquitos. However, there was no need to worry about things like mosquitos at Crescent Mountain.The sweet scent grass\u2019s function was not merely being beautiful and emitting out a sweet scent. Sweet scent grass also had the function of driving insects away. No matter was it mosquito, housefly or grass-eating insects, sweet scent grass would drive them away from Crescent Mountain by emitting a smell that was targeted against them.How does the sweet scent grass differentiate what kind of pests to drive away? Because this area was Thunder-Yang Tree\u2019s domain, when the domain was constructed, it used Zhang Han\u2019s thoughts to define what insects were counted as pests.Standing under Thunder-Yang Tree, Zhang Han\u2019s gaze swept through the vegetable area. The vegetables were planted a few days late and were still not yet mature right now. I will just have to wait a few more days.The ingredients that were available right now were rice, chicken eggs, a few spring onion and other ingredients that were bought from the supermarket, for example, carrot, onion, tomato and so on\u2026\u2026What should I make tonight?Stir-fried onion and egg, stir-fried tomato and egg?Thinking back and forth, only eggs were available to eat right now, thus Zhang Han muttered to himself for a while, and decided to make egg fried rice tonight.Egg fried rice was a common delicious food and was also something that most people knew how to make.Sometimes after finish eating a meal, there would be some rice left over. When waking up on the second day, a plate of egg fried rice could be made with the leftover rice. It was economical and tasty at the same time.It was relatively simple to cook egg fried rice. After preparing the ingredients, just a few minutes was enough to cook egg fried rice. Also, not only egg fried rice, there were other fried rice dishes that were very simple and convenient too. Say, for example, Yangzhou fried rice, soy sauce fried rice, sausage fried rice, shrimp and vegetable fried rice, and so on\u2026\u2026There were even roadside stalls that sold fried rice specially and were loved by people.Zhang Han wanted to make something better for Meng Meng to eat. But the ingredients that were available right now was not able to support Zhang Han. Furthermore, the planting area at Crescent Mountain had only just taken form and still was still far from being complete.After deciding, Zhang Han stood up and walked to Meng Meng\u2019s side.\u201cMeng Meng, the sky is dark already, we have to go back to eat dinner.\u201d Zhang Han said with a light laugh.\u201cAiya, alright then. Xiao Hei, bye bye, big Golden Retriever, small Golden Retriever, big Husky, small Husky, big Chow Chow, small Chow Chow, big poodle, small poodle\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng one by one said goodbye to the doggies.The doggies also very gave face, gathering to the front of Meng Meng and shaking their tongue in response to Meng Meng.Xiao Hei personally saw off Zhang Han and Meng Meng to the bottom of the mountain. All the way until the Jeep left his line of sight, then did he turned around and headed back to the mountain top.Perhaps before Zhang Han transformed him, he treated Zhang Han as just a passer-by. But after Zhang Han transformed him, he treated Zhang Han as his master for the rest of his life, and also the master which he firmly believed that he had to protect for his entire life.Liked it?

    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - First guestPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euReturning back to the restaurant, Zhang Han placed the little princess on the sofa, opened the television and switched it to the children channel, then went to begin making the first meal he would be making for the little princess.Zhang Han cooked the fresh cow milk first.Taking out a rice cooker, the rice cooker was bought by Zhao Kai. Zhao Kai knew that Zhang Han was opening a restaurant, thus the rice cooker he bought was quite big.Zhang Han used the tap water and washed the rice 2 times. Washing the rice 2 times was more or less enough. Rice cannot be washed more than 3 times. If the rice was washed more than 3 times, a lot of the nutrients of the rice would be washed away, and the fragrant of the rice after it has been cooked would also be less fragrant.During the third time, Zhang Han poured the spiritual water into the rice cooker. The rice to spiritual water ratio was roughly 1:1.2. Using a hand was enough to measure it. Pressing down your palm onto the rice, the amount of water just has to be slightly a bit more than the rice, with the water being the same level as your palm. Zhang Han learned all those small general knowledge just only recently.After all, there was Meng Meng now. Zhang Han had to start learning all kind of things.The cow milk finished cooking very quickly. Although the range hood was very impressive, a faint milk fragrance still filled the house.\u201cWhat a fragrant smell.\u201dA customer entered into the restaurant through the door. After she smelled the milk fragrance, she couldn\u2019t help but swallowed her saliva. She felt that she had never smelled before milk that has such mouthwatering milk fragrant in her life. It must be known that she didn\u2019t really like drinking milk, and had never thought that milk would be able to emit a fragrance that would make her want to immediately drink it.\u201cBoss, what food does this restaurant of yours have? Give me a glass of cow milk first\u2026\u2026Eh? It\u2019s you?\u201d The female said as she took 2 steps forward. When she saw Zhang Han\u2019s appearance and the appearance of the little princess who was on the sofa, she immediately opened her eyes wide.She was the white color bikini beautiful woman that was at the beach at Crescent Gulf who gave Meng Meng a beverage a few days ago, Liang Mengqi. She did not had any impression of Zhang Han, but she remembered Meng Meng\u2019s appearance very vividly.Meng Meng was very pretty. Without a need for any question, it was because of inheriting Zi Yan\u2019s excellent genes. Even when Liang Mengqi returned home, Meng Meng\u2019s figure would still flash in her mind time from time. Big eyes, long eyelashes, white and delicate face, Meng Meng was just like a little princess that was in a fairy tale.\u201cWho are you?\u201dZhang Han took a look at Liang Mengqi indifferently. Oval face, big eyes, wearing leisure clothes, short sleeves, and short pants, a pair of long and slender legs, and sandals worn on her feet. It must be said that this was a beautiful woman who was above 88 points. Although the person was beautiful, Zhang Han did not have any impression of her.\u201cHey! Uncle, I am the kind and beautiful woman who was declined by you when I gave your daughter a beverage to drink.\u201d Liang Mengqi said loudly.\u201cOh.\u201d Zhang Han replied indifferently, not having any interest on his face.\u201cBig, big sister, hello.\u201d Meng Meng stretched out her little palm and greeted.\u201cHello, sweetie.\u201d Liang Mengqi smiled and walked to the front of the sofa, wanting to sit down and play with Meng Meng for a bit.\u201cThe white color chair that is in front of the window there is the place for customers to sit at.\u201d Zhang Han said indifferently.Liang Mengqi\u2019s expression froze.\u201cHey, say, why are you so insensible?\u201d Liang Mengqi glared at Zhang Han and said.However, Zhang Han did not pay attention to her.\u201cHumph!\u201d Liang Mengqi snorted lightly, conveying the discontent in her heart. However, in the end, she didn\u2019t sit on the sofa. After all, since the owner did not allow her to sit on the sofa, thus she would also not force it. Turning around, she walked towards the white color small dining table. While walking, she opened her mouth and asked, \u201cWhat food do you have here? Give me a menu to look at.\u201d\u201cNo menu. There are only egg fried rice and cow milk today.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cEgg fried rice and cow milk?\u201d Liang Mengqi went into a daze, her expression somewhat astonished.Not talking about this restaurant\u2019s renovation which did not look like how a restaurant should be, even food was not prepared? What kind of restaurant was this?Liang Mengqi even had the thought to turned around and leave the restaurant. However, the milk fragrance that she smelled earlier on cut off that thought of hers.\u201cGive me a plate of egg fried rice and a cup of cow milk then!\u201d Liang Mengqi said petulantly, then sat on the small chair that was in front of the window, took out her phone and started using her phone.\u201cWait for a while then.\u201d Zhang Han replied.After chopping up the green onion on the chopping board, Zhang Han took out 4 chicken eggs that were each roughly the size of a goose egg, cracked the eggs into a big bowl and stirred well, then place the bowl on one side. After thinking for a bit, he took out a small carrot and cut it into small cubes.At this time, the rice was also cooked. When Zhang Han opened the lid, the steam immediately came out, and the rice fragrance drifted around the house.\u201cEh?\u201dLiang Mengqi who was currently playing a phone game suddenly smelled the rice fragrance, and couldn\u2019t help but exclaimed.The smell of the cow milk was already that fragrant already, so how could the rice be this fragrant too? It shouldn\u2019t be possible! Could it be that I am hallucinating because I am too hungry?Liang Mengqi was confused in her heart. She carefully sized the inside of the house and immediately felt that Zhang Han\u2019s taste was quite good. She knew that the cost of the Steinway Model O Grand Piano and that jadeite television wall was at least above a million.\u201cHe knows how to play the piano? I reckon it is only a decoration.\u201d Liang Mengqi mumbled to herself.\u201cDaddy, daddy, it smells so nice, Meng Meng is hungry already. Meng Meng wants to eat rice rice.\u201d Even Meng Meng was attracted by the fragrance of the rice as she turned her head around, looked at Zhang Han and urged him.\u201cIt will be ready in 10 minutes, wait for a while okay.\u201d Zhang Han laughed lightly and replied.While talking, he used a rice scooper to mix the rice around, and placed the rice at one side to let it cool down.Afterward, Zhang Han took out the heaven fragrant wood. Revolving the spiritual strength within his body to his palm, he lightly pressed onto the heaven fragrant wood.\u201cBang!\u201dA subtle depressed sound rang out.The heaven fragrant wood was still that heaven fragrant wood, there was not the slightest change at all.However, when Zhang Han took out a rolling pin and lightly tapped the rolling pin on the heaven fragrant wood, in a moment, the heaven fragrant wood turned into fine powder.Zhang Han rolled the rolling pin onto the fine power for a few times, then placed the fine powder of the heaven fragrant wood into a seasoning bottle.Heaven fragrant wood was colorless and tasteless. Heaven fragrant wood\u2018s function was raising the fragrance of the essence of an ingredient.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - The Incense of Subverting IdeasPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euAlthough heaven fragrant wood was only a rank 1 spiritual treasure, it was basically the best seasoning on earth.Just when Zhang Han just placed the heaven fragrant wood seasoning into the seasoning bottle, 2 more customers came into the restaurant.Not sure what was going on, the 2 customers were again females and seemed to be around the age of 20. This was the third batch of customers already, and furthermore, the females were all of the same suits. Could it be that this restaurant attracts females?The 2 females seemed somewhat non-mainstream. Their hair was dyed yellow-purple, which looks very bright, and their dressing was also somewhat wild, seemingly to be females in their rebellious phase.\u201cHey, boss, give us the menu.\u201dOne of the females which had a pointy face said loudly.\u201cNo menu, there are only egg fried rice and cow milk today.\u201d Zhang Han replied after packing the heaven fragrant wood.\u201cNani?\u201dThe pointy faced female opened her eyes wide and sneered. With some sneer in her tone, she said, \u201cWhat kind of joke is this? If you only have egg fried rice, why did you even bother opening a restaurant?\u201d\u201cWhat other people sell in their restaurant has nothing to do with you.\u201d The pointy face female\u2019s companion patted on her, then turned her gaze to Zhang Han and said, \u201cHow much do your egg fried rice and cow milk cost?\u201dWithout a menu, they naturally did not know the price too. Thus, she asked.Upon hearing that, Zhang Han slightly went into a daze. He had never thought about the price before. After muttering for a while, he looked towards the female who asked him and said, \u201cHow much do the egg fried rice and cow milk at other places cost?\u201dEn?The female\u2019s brows wrinkled slightly. She felt that this restaurant was becoming more and more unqualified. If not for the restaurant being very clean, she would even suspect that this person did not even have a business permit.\u201cNormally for restaurants like yours, a plate of egg fried rice normally costs around 28rmb, and a cup of cow milk would cost 8rmb.\u201dNormally for small restaurants and peddlers, each plate of egg fried rice would only cost 12 rmb, and a cup of cow milk would only cost 3 rmb. But for Zhang Han\u2019s restaurant which was this clean and graceful, the price would be higher a bit, which was pretty close to what female said.\u201cOh, then, my egg fried egg will be 280 rmb per plate, and the cow milk will be 80 rmb per cup.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head and replied.Little did he know, his words caused the expression of the 2 female customers to change. Even Liang Mengqi also took a look at Zhang Han somewhat bizarrely, not knowing where he got the confidence from to dare to sell 10 times the price.\u201cAre you mad?\u201d The pointy faced female\u2019s tone became sharp, as she said, \u201cWhat kind of business are you doing? A plate of egg fried rice for 280rmb? Kitchen god Wang Long\u2019s egg fried rice can be sold for 5000rmb, but do you think that you are him? If you were him, would you still be opening a small restaurant here?\u201dWang Long was Xiangjiang\u2019s famous chief god. His title of chief god was absolutely not undeserved, his cooking skills were very high and even Zhou Chi\u2019s movie, The God of Cookery, was filmed using his foods as a model. Furthermore, Wang Long had worked as a chef in many famous 5 star restaurants that were in Xiangjiang and was deeply liked by the higher society people. Even furthermore, many big shots whose name could shake an area were also his frequent customers.Thus, he was able to sell a plate of egg fried rice for 5k rmb. Even more, the 5k rmb egg fried rice was always mentioned by others and had been on the lead news for quite a number of times.Many people knew about that, but Zhang Han did not understand any of that, and also did not have the interest to understand.\u201cIf you are not eating, then leave.\u201d Zhang Han frowned slightly when he saw that Meng Meng was somewhat afraid because of that female\u2019s sharp voice, and said with a deep voice, \u201cAlso, I don\u2019t know whatever Wang Long or Li Long. If he sells it for 5k rmb, I will sell it for 50k rmb then.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d The pointy faced female was just about to start fuming but was pulled back by her companion that was beside her.Although her companion was dressed quite wildly too, it could still be seen that she was still the relatively tender type. Although she was unhappy in her heart, her tone was still calm,\u201cMister, the price that you are selling is indeed somewhat excessive, to the point that we can go to the consumer association to complain about you. Furthermore, Wang Long sold a plate of egg fried rice for 5k rmb, but the rice he used is Thailand rice, and the rice was even dried for a year. Not anyone can sell a plate of egg fried rice for such a high price.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Zhang Han took a look at the woman and said with a trace of disdain in his tone, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about drying the rice for a year, even if he dried the rice for a hundred years, his rice would also not be comparable to my rice.\u201dRegarding ingredients, in this world, there was no rice that could be compared to the rice that was grown at Crescent Mountain. Whatever Thailand rice, Australia rice, North America rice, they could not be compared against Zhang Han\u2019s rice.On earth, martial arts world or cultivation world may perhaps exist too, and they would perhaps also have high grade rice. But who could confirm it if no one has ever seen it? And even if there really were other high grade rice, don\u2019t forget that Crescent Mountain was still able to continue growing. Crescent Mountain had only just taken form. After Thunder-Yang Tree finishes constructing Crescent Mountain for 3 times, at that time, Crescent Mountain would thoroughly transform into a true treasure land. At that time, the ingredients that were grown in Crescent Mountain would definitely be matchless.\u201cYou! Truly unreasonable! Let\u2019s go!\u201dThe female said angrily. Fearing that the pointy faced female would start raging, she grabbed the pointy faced female and left the restaurant angrily.\u201cDaddy, they are so fierce.\u201d Meng Meng said softly.\u201cThey are but insects who have no insight. You don\u2019t have to care about them. Daddy will start cooking now, we will be able to eat in a while.\u201d Zhang Han smiled slightly.\u201cOh, alright. Don\u2019t, don\u2019t care about the insects, en.\u201d Meng Meng replied, then turned her head around and continued watching the television.This scene caused Liang Mengqi\u2019s expression to immediately become stiff. The corner of her mouth twitched slightly as she sighed in her heart at Zhang Han\u2019s unusual teaching method.Just when Zhang Han was beginning to cook, Liang Mengqi opened her mouth and asked,\u201cHey, you are not really intending to sell a plate of egg fried rice for 50k rmb right?\u201dIn Liang Mengqi\u2019s point of view, a plate of egg fried rice for 50k rmb was really a bit over the top. Although 50k was not much to her at all, but no one would want to anyhow spend their money away like this.\u201c280 rmb.\u201d Zhang Han replied without raising his head.In Zhang Han\u2019s point of view, it was reasonable even if he sold the egg fried rice for 50k rmb per plate. But after thinking about it, there was no need to make others feel too astonished, just the price of 10 times more than a normal plate of egg fried rice will do.\u201cOh.\u201d Liang Mengqi nodded her head and curled her lips, \u201cFaster a bit, I\u2019m feeling super hungry.\u201d\u201cFaster a bit, Meng Meng is also feeling super hungry.\u201d Meng Meng pouted her mouth hand urged.\u201cAlright, alright, it will be ready in a while.\u201d Zhang Han laughed lightly and began cooking the egg fried rice.There were quite a few methods to cook egg fried rice. One of the methods was to mix the beaten egg with the rice. That way, the egg fried rice that was cooked would be gold color, with every grain of rice being coated by the egg.However, Zhang Han did not intend to cook it this way, and instead intended to cook the egg and rice separately.Thus, Zhang Han poured the eggs into the pan and stir-fry it. After stir-frying the eggs into small pieces, he took the eggs out of the pan. Eggs cook very quickly and were not suitable for stir-frying for too long. If the egg was overcooked, the taste of the egg would not be as good.Zhang Han poured some soybean oil into the pan, added in the carrot cubes, stir-fry it for a while, and added in the rice. After stir-frying it well, he added in the eggs and sprinkled a bit of salt and thirteen spices. When the egg fried rice was about to be done, Zhang Han sprinkled the heaven fragrant wood seasoning. Immediately, the fragrant of the egg fried rice became somewhat stronger.After cooking finish, Zhang Han split the egg fried rice into 3 portions.Zhang Han and Meng Meng used porcelain plate for the egg fried rice and glass cup for the cow milk. While Liang Mengqi was given disposable utensils.Zhang Han placed the 2 plate of egg fried rice and 2 cups of cow milk on the dining table and opened the crystal chandelier on top. Immediately, the lighting in the house became brighter.\u201cMeng Meng, come, time to eat.\u201dZhang Han carried Meng Meng and walked towards the dining table. After sitting down, he took a look at Liang Mengqi indifferently and said, \u201cYou go take yourself.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Liang Mengqi slightly went into a daze and felt somewhat indignant in her heart.In this restaurant, the customers still have to take the food themselves?\u201cHumph! I will see if this egg fried rice of yours is worth 280 rmb or not!\u201d Liang Mengqi knew that she would not be able to change Zhang Han\u2019s mind and thus snorted lightly and walked towards the kitchen unwillingly.Seeing that the utensils were all disposable products, this treatment caused Liang Mengqi\u2019s expression to become somewhat rigid and felt discontent in her heart.But in the next moment, the fragrance that assailed her nostrils immediately dispelled all the discontent in her heart.\u201cIt smells so nice.\u201dLiang Mengqi sighed in her heart as she felt her stomach starting to grumble. She immediately took a plate of egg fried rice and walked back to the dining table that was in the front of the window.She used 2 times her normal speed to open the disposable chopsticks. When she was about to start eating, she stopped.It was her habit to not rush when eating good food and leave the best for last. Thus, she picked up the paper cup, intending to have a mouth of the cow milk first.However, when she took a mouth of the cow milk, her eyes immediately opened wide.It was the first time that she had tasted such tasty cow milk!Other fresh cow milk, they would taste somewhat bland if you don\u2019t add sugar, and even more, if the milk wasn\u2019t cooked well, there would be a slightly sour taste. And when you add sugar, it would change the taste of the milk. Whereas this milk that she just drank, there was no taste of sugar at all, but when drank, it still tasted incomparably sweet and rich. The milk fragrance was ample and was extremely rich. As she drank it, she even forgot about the time and where she was, all the way until she finished drinking the cup of cow milk.\u201cBoss, why is this cow milk this fragrant?\u201d Liang Mengqi couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cThis is the world\u2019s purest fresh milk.\u201d Zhang Han did not turn his head at all as he replied.\u201cOh.\u201d Liang Mengqi nodded her head endearingly. Her gaze was somewhat excited as she looked towards the egg fried rice.Since the cow milk tasted that good, the egg fried rice must definitely also be good!Liang Mengqi wanted to use the chopsticks, but after thinking about it, she picked up the plastic spoon at the side.Liang Mengqi picked up a spoonful of egg fried rice and ate it. The egg was soft and tender, the rice was soft and a bit sticky, and the carrot cubes were a bit crispy. While eating the egg fried rice, the texture was ample. The fragrant of the rice, fragrant of the egg, and a bit of the fragrant of the carrot lingered in her mouth, making her to couldn\u2019t help but close her eyes and savor the taste.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026is this still even considered egg fried rice?\u201d\u201cIs there such tasty egg fried rice in this world?\u201d\u201cThis egg fried rice is 100 times, no, 1000 times better than Wang Long\u2019s egg fried rice!\u201dLiang Mengqi was thoroughly astonished. She was expecting the egg fried rice to give her a surprise, but she had absolutely never thought that the surprise would actually be this huge!Fragrant!Only this word was able to describe it. This egg fried rice was really fragrant! Even to the point that she felt that the egg fried rice she ate in the past were all fake!She had eaten before the dishes that Wang Long cooked and had also tasted before the 5k rmb egg fried rice. At that time, she thought that Wang Long\u2019s egg fried rice was one of the best in this world already, but the egg fried rice that was before her eyes right now had completely overturned her notion!Liked it?

    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - Conquered EaterPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euWang Long\u2019s egg fried rice, compared to this egg fried rice was truly the difference between earth and heaven!After eating a few mouths, Liang Mengqi took the chopsticks that were at the side, picked up a grain of the rice and took a few looks at it attentively.The grain of rice was plump and snow white. She tried biting onto the grain of rice, and the sturdiness of the rice made her exclaimed repeatedly,Seems like what this boss said was true, even if that Thailand rice was dried for a hundred years, it still wouldn\u2019t be comparable to his rice.Soon after, she picked up a small piece of egg and tasted it. When she tasted the egg, it actually gave her a feeling that she had never tasted egg before.When she tasted the carrot cube, she finally regained back her conscious.\u201cThis carrot is real.\u201d Liang Mengqi\u2019s gaze was somewhat in a daze, the taste of the carrot finally made her felt that she found a familiar taste.\u201cThis fried rice is truly worth 50k rmb. For the boss to sell it for 280 rmb, he is really a merchant who has a conscience.\u201dLiang Mengqi sighed for a bit. She suddenly thought of the 2 females. If they were to know the taste of the egg fried rice, they would most likely regret that they left the restaurant!Liang Mengqi started eating the egg fried rice mouth by mouth. As she eats, she gradually forgot about everything. In her eyes, there was only the egg fried rice in front of her!All the way until she finished eating the egg fried rice, Liang Mengqi still sub-consciously moved the spoon to the plate. When she realized that there was no more food, a sense of loss actually welled up in her heart.She turned her head around and took a look at the inner side. She saw that Meng Meng and Zhang Han had finished eating and the little princess was currently praising that the food her daddy cooked was really delicious.\u201cBoss.\u201d Liang Mengqi called out softly.\u201cEn?\u201d\u201cAbout that\u2026\u2026\u201d Liang Mengqi said somewhat shyly, \u201cI\u2019m still not full yet, I want another plate of egg fried rice and another cup of cow milk.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201dZhang Han nodded his head and walked to the kitchen counter. There was still a plate worth of egg fried rice left. After placing the egg fried rice onto a plate and pouring a cup of cow milk, he wanted to carry it over to Liang Mengqi, but discovered that the girl was following behind him and looking at him anxiously.Thus, Zhang Han just straightforwardly placed the plate and cup on the kitchen counter. As if obtaining a treasure, Liang Mengqi carried the food very carefully to the dining table.\u201cDaddy, Meng Meng still wants to eat, but, but I am already full.\u201d Meng Meng sat on the chair and said with a somewhat perplex expression.On her plate, there was still 1/3 of egg fried rice left.\u201cYou cannot eat anymore if you are full. Daddy will cook for you again tomorrow morning.\u201d Zhang Han walked over and laughed as he patted onto Meng Meng\u2019s little head.\u201cHumph! But why can big sister eat two plates?\u201d Meng Meng lightly snorted and said.\u201cBecause when a person grows up, their appetite will also become bigger.\u201d\u201cThen, then when can Meng Meng grow up? Meng Meng also wants to eat.\u201d With her eyes not leaving the egg fried rice that was left on the plate, Meng Meng pouted her mouth and said.\u201cMeng Meng will slowly grow up.\u201d Zhang Han said as he took the plate away and placed it in the kitchen sink.Not being able to see the egg fried rice, Meng Meng\u2019s thoughts of it diminished somewhat.Zhang Han carried Meng Meng and sat on the sofa that was at the side of the piano.\u201cDaddy, what are we sitting at here for? Meng Meng still wants to go play toys.\u201d Meng Meng asked curiously.\u201cWe have to rest for a while first after we have finished eating. Listen to daddy play for you two piece of songs first. You can go and play after finish listening okay?\u201d Zhang Han said with a slight smile.Some people would say that after eating, one has to walk a hundred steps to be able to live to 99 years old. But little did they know that this saying was incorrect. Normally after a meal, one has to rest for at least half an hour, and it would only do if they sit down for a short period of time before exercise. If a person was to start exercising immediately after they just had their meal, it would affect their digestive system.When Meng Meng heard that she could not play, her little mouth started pouting. But when she heard that Zhang Han was going to play the piano, she immediately became interested as she raised her little arms and welcomed her daddy to present his piano skill.Zhang Han sat on the piano chair, opened the piano cover and dragged his finger from the left side of the piano key to the right side of the piano key.Hearing the piano\u2019s tone, Zhang Han nodded his head in satisfaction.The piano was tuned well. Seems like that friend of Zhao Kai\u2019s was indeed a professional.\u201cI dedicate\u2026Variations on Canon to my adorable darling Meng Meng.\u201dZhang Han spread out both of his hands, and before playing, looked towards Meng Meng and said with a laugh.This sentence caused Meng Meng to be delighted as she said with her small voice, \u201cDaddy, you are the most handsome!\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201dZhang Han laughed lightly as he shook his head. After lightly taking a breath in, his fingers started pressing down on the piano keys.A classic piece which had been passed down from ancient times, Variations on Canon, began playing.At this time, Liang Mengqi also finished eating the egg fried rice. She patted onto her stuffed belly and sighed while shaking her head.Isn\u2019t this fried rice just too delicious already?Even Liang Mengqi\u2019s picky tongue was also able to finish two plates of egg fried rice. This alone was enough to show just what kind of existence Zhang Han\u2019s egg fried rice was to a foodie.I really don\u2019t know how he is able to cook out such a tasty egg fried rice!Liang Mengqi drank a small mouth of cow milk, slowly savoring the pure fragrant of the milk. Suddenly, a piano sound came pouring into her ears.She couldn\u2019t help but turned her head around and looked towards the source of the piano sound.Eh? He even knows how to play the piano?Liang Mengqi felt somewhat curious in her heart.This is unexpected. He also seems to be able to play the piano quite well.Liang Mengqi looked at the side of Zhang Han\u2019s face. Right after her tongue had finished enjoying, another enjoyment was here for her ears. In a moment, she was somewhat dazed and lost in thought.There was some difference in the tempo of the Variations on Canon that Zhang Han played. The tempo was occasionally fast and occasionally slow. Although the piece of music was still Canon, the occasional fast and slow tempo seemed to make the Canon became alive. The music was occasionally lively and occasionally melodious.But no matter what, this shows that Zhang Han\u2019s piano skill was already at a certain level.He is a master pianist!Liang Mengqi looked at the side of Zhang Han\u2019s face and thought to herself.She understood a bit about pianos and also liked listening to a lot of piano songs. She knew that, when a person did not need a musical score and was able to control the tempo of the piano song and not be controlled by the musical score, it means that the person was already a master pianist!Just like the China genius pianist, Liang Zong.Liang Zong was this world\u2019s first rate pianist master. Before returning back to his country, he conquered the conductors of 10 symphony orchestra, conquered the master pianists who were still alive in this world and conquered his teacher, the president of Curtis Institute of Music, Gary.Curtis Institute of Music was one of the top 3 within the world\u2019s classic musical academy. But ever since Liang Zong became famous worldwide, Curtis Institute of Music had been ranked first in successive years. When Curtis Institute of Music got those honor, the people in the country still did not know who Liang Zong was. Remember that, there was a time when he came back to the country, and because he had no reputation, the organization requested to change out Liang Zong. This action immediately caused the conductor of the world\u2019s top rate symphony orchestra that was accompanying Liang Zong to fly into a rage on the spot and criticized the organization to be as blind as a bet, to not even know one of the world\u2019s top pianist.Why do I feel that he\u2026\u2026is more formidable than Liang Zong?As Liang Mengqi listens to Zhang Han play the piano, this kind of feeling suddenly bubbled up from her heart. Even she herself was somewhat surprised at this feeling. It must be known that Liang Zong was one of this world\u2019s renowned top pianist!If Zhang Han was to know Liang Mengqi\u2019s thoughts, he would definitely laugh lightly in his heart.If you had 500 years, you would also be able to be this good at the piano!\u201cThis piece is finished. I will now dedicate Joe Hisashi\u2019s Summer for Meng Meng\u201d Zhang Han laughed lightly and said.\u201cDaddy is so awesome\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng said with a worshipping look on her face. Although she was somewhat in a daze when listening to the piano song her daddy played, but seeing her daddy\u2019s fingers moving at lightning speed on the piano keys, she felt that her daddy was very awesome.Liang Mengqi sat on the chair, having no thoughts of leaving. She somewhat acknowledged Zhang Han in her heart, although the first meeting they had wasn\u2019t pleasant.Just when Zhang Han was about to begin playing the piano again, another batch of customers came to the restaurant.The customers this time was finally males. 4 young guys who seemed to be of the age of 17 walked into the restaurant.\u201cBoss, what food do you have here?\u201d One of the young guys opened his mouth and asked.Seeing this, Liang Mengqi lightly sighed in her heart. She felt that the boss was going to start working since there were customers now, thus she also intended to leave.Just that, out of her expectation, Zhang Han did not even turn his head around and replied indifferently,\u201cWe are sold for the day.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d The few young guys turned around and left.This caused Liang Mengqi to could not help but slightly went into a daze, as she once again felt how formidable Zhang Han was.If she had not already eaten 2 plates of egg fried rice, she would think that this was a fake restaurant. Where would people open a restaurant like this? Conveniently selling 2 plates of egg fried rice when he was cooking for his daughter, and not selling anymore afterward?\u201cWhat a strange person.\u201d Liang Mengqi mumbled to herself.At the next moment, the melodious piano sound rang out once again. The lively tempo of Joe Hisashi\u2019s Summer was played well by Zhang Han.After finishing playing this piece, Zhang Han closed the piano cover and ended his performance.\u201cAwesome, awesome!\u201d Meng Meng praised.\u201cClap, clap, clap\u2026\u2026\u201dLiang Mengqi couldn\u2019t help but applaud.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Liang Mengqi looked at Zhang Han and asked somewhat curiously.\u201cMy, my daddy is called Zhang\u2026Han. I am called Meng Meng.\u201d Meng Meng replied with her small voice.\u201cZhang Han\u2026\u2026\u201dLiang Mengqi laughed and said, \u201cYou played the piano quite well.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head slightly.\u201cThe egg fried rice that you made is much tastier, and the cow milk is also super delicious. How did you make those? Is it because the original ingredients are good or something?\u201d Liang Mengqi asked extremely curiously.\u201cMy ingredients cannot be eaten at any other place.\u201d Zhang Han laughed slightly and replied.\u201cCannot be eaten at any other place? What do I do? My mouth has already been raised picky by you. After eating your rice, I don\u2019t even want to eat the rice of other restaurants.\u201d Liang Mengqi muttered for a while, then asked hurriedly, \u201cWhat time do your restaurant normally open for business?\u201d\u201cDepends on my mood I guess.\u201d Zhang Han had also never considered about the operating hours for the restaurant. However, he only intended to sell food when he was cooking for Meng Meng.Seems like I have to make a sign at the door to prevent people from entering during the time when I am not opened for business.Zhang Han stroked his chin and muttered to himself.\u201cDepends on your mood?\u201d Liang Mengqi slightly went into a daze. It was still the first time that she had seen such a restaurant.However, after thinking about the taste of the egg fried rice just now, she actually had no more interest in any other food and was already thinking about coming here the next day to eat. Thus, she asked, \u201cThen, do you have any specific time where you will be opened for business? I still want to come here to eat egg fried rice tomorrow.\u201dWhile talking, Liang Mengqi\u2019s expression changed into a pitiful look, seemingly as if saying that if she can\u2019t eat the egg fried rice, she would be unhappy.\u201cProbably morning, noon and night. Morning 7am to 8am, noon 12pm to 1pm, night 6pm to 7pm. The restaurant will be opened for business at those time.\u201d After thinking about it, Zhang Han gave the precise timings where he would be opened for business.Liked it?

    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - ActorsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBesides egg fried rice, are there any other foods?\u201d Liang Mengqi asked.\u201cThere are. There will be more foods in the future, and the foods will only get better and better.\u201dZhang Han said with a calm tone. Towards his first customer, Zhang Han decided to reply to some of her questions.\u201cThat\u2019s great! Then, will the dishes be as delicious as the egg fried rice?\u201d A trace of excitement appeared on Liang Mengqi\u2019s expression.\u201cOf course.\u201d Zhang Han took a look at this beautiful foodie and said with a slight smile.\u201cI look forward to eating your food, I had a great time eating today. Here is the money for the food, you don\u2019t have to give me the change, I will come again tomorrow morning at 7 am.\u201d Liang Mengqi placed a few hundred dollar bills on the table and said to Zhang Han with a smile. Afterward, she looked towards Meng Meng, stretched out her hand and said, \u201cMeng Meng, see you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cGoodbye!\u201d Meng Meng stretched out her little palm and waved.Liang Mengqi waved her hand and left with a smile.Zhang Han walked to the table and picked up the money. There was a total of 800 rmb on the table. Liang Mengqi got 2 plates of egg fried rice and 2 cups of cow milk. According to the price that Zhang Han gave, it was 720 rmb. Originally, with Zhang Han\u2019s temperament, he would just charge it as 700 rmb. Seems like that Liang Mengqi had quite an enjoyable meal.Zhang Han casually placed the money in the drawer of the table which the laptop was placed on. Within the drawer, there was roughly 70k+ cash, and within the car that Zhang Han drove, there was also roughly about 60k+ cash.After placing the money in the drawer, Zhang Han originally wanted to play with Meng Meng for a while, but when he turned his head, he discovered that the little princess had already ran to the sofa and was currently playing with her toys on the sofa.Zhang Han smiled and shook his head. After muttering to himself for a bit, he decided to begin writing out those songs.Thus, Zhang Han first went on the internet and searched for a bit.There is quite a lot of negative news regarding Joker Xue huh.When Zhang Han opened the web page, at first sight, he saw Joker Xue\u2019s news on the popular search. Since he had nothing to do, he clicked into the news and took a few looks. After looking at the news, he discovered that Joker Xue\u2019s circumstance was not that good.When a person became popular and attracted attention, all sorts of news regarding them would surface from time to time. Every popular celebrity had a lot of negative news regarding them.Recently, there was a lot of negative news regarding Joker Xue and the situation had gotten more and more problematic. Being afraid of being affected, variety shows, commercial performances and so on all canceled their collaboration with Joker Xue.\u201cJoker Xue will be forcibly holding a concert at Linhai on the 15th.\u201dZhang Han saw another news. The editor who wrote that news seems to be a fan of Joker Xue. At the bottom of the news, \u2018your fans still love you\u2019, was written.There were also some photos attached to the news, and the news was more or less saying that his fans have not abandoned him, the tickets of the concert were all sold out within an hour and right now, and the price of scalper tickets had already increased 5 times of the original price.Which also means that, right now, the price of an ordinary ticket was already at 3k rmb+ and the price of a vip ticket was already over 10k rmb.This kind of situation was evidently rarely seen. This situation may also have some relation with that things would develop in the opposite direction when they reached an extreme. Joker Xue\u2019s popularity was high, and right now, all of the news was about negative things regarding him, which caused his fans to be indignant. Just nice, Joker Xue was going to hold a concert on the 15th and many fans felt that, although the sponsors had abandoned Joker Xue, they would not abandon him, and thus the tickets were all sold out very quickly.(\u7269\u6781\u5fc5\u53cd: Things would develop in the opposite direction when they reached an extreme \u2013 Meaning like, when a bad thing becomes incredibly bad, it can become good/turn out to have a positive effect. Something like that I think.)Zhang Han muttered to himself for a bit.\u201cI can write the song, \u2018actor\u2019.\u201dAlthough Zhang Han had never chase after celebrities, but there were some singers that he like listening to, and Joker Xue was one of them. Joker Xue\u2019s songs were quite nice, and the voice of Joker Xue was deep and pleasant to listen to.Talking about the song \u2018actor\u2019, it could be counted as one of his most famous songs. This song had once obtained champion on the world\u2019s Chinese music chart.This song had the route of a sad love song, the lyrics interpreted the love, hate, and entanglement of a romantic fable.I will write this song I guess.Zhang Han took out a paper and pen from another drawer, sat on the chair that was in front of the piano, opened the piano cover, closed his eyes and began recalling the accompaniment of \u2018actor\u2019.The accompaniment was not complicated. The goodness of this song was completely reflected through Joker Xue\u2019s singing skill.Very quickly, Zhang Han recalled the piano accompaniment and tried playing it once. After discovering that the piano accompaniment was the same as the accompaniment in his memory, he took the pen and wrote it down.\u201cI still have to make finish the complete version of the accompaniment.\u201dZhang Han muttered to himself for a bit. On the internet, he searched for a recording studio that was nearby Crescent Gulf, intending to go there to finish making the music.After searching the location, Zhang Han carried Meng Meng and left the house, and came to a recording studio that was at Crescent Gulf.Although Zhang Han did not understand much about the equipment of the recording studio, music was within one\u2019s heart. Through the tuning master\u2019s 3 hours of hard work, the background music of \u2018actor\u2019 was manufactured. 3 hours at the recording cost Zhang Han 1.2k rmb.After finishing with those, it was already 10pm night. Returning back to the restaurant, Zhang Han recorded the piano song of \u2018actor\u2019 with his phone and began writing down the lyrics on the file,\u201cSimply, talk simply. Please ignore the recent state of mind. You aren\u2019t an actor. Don\u2019t make up any of those plots. No motives, I only just want to see how you justify. Your expression of discomfort like an actor of no skill that the audience discern at first glance\u2026\u2026\u201dThe lyrics were written out very quickly. After finishing everything, and furthermore indicated the matters to take note of, Zhang Han arranged everything into a file and sent it over as an email.At this time, Meng Meng who was waiting at one side was somewhat impatient already, mumbling about when was it time to go sleep.Zhang Han hurriedly carried Meng Meng and walked towards the bedroom that was on the 2nd floor, preparing to coax Meng Meng to sleep.Meng Meng wanted to listen to a story and thus Zhang Han told a story for her to listen to.All those Snow White and so on, Meng Meng had already listened before. Even stories like Alice in Wonderland and Frozen, Meng Meng had also listened to it multiple times. Zi Yan knew about stories like those and thus told Meng Meng about those stories a lot of times.There were only stories that Zhang Han did not know, and no stories that Zi Yan could not tell.However, Zhang Han had his own ways, he could tell Meng Meng stories about him searching for treasures.\u201cDo you know how Han Yang Immortal Monarch got the Heaven Connecting Tree? Let me tell you, the story about how he got it is quite complicated\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026At the same time, at a high-level apartment that was located very nearby to Zhang Han.\u201cYawn\u2026\u2026\u201dManager Li Fan took off the high-quality headphones and took a yawn. Taking a look at Joker Xue who was playing the guitar and looking for a feeling, he mumbled, \u201cSigh, just what are those songs that were delivered to us? They are practically a bunch of freaks! Some of them even said that they don\u2019t need any money, but in the end, the songs that they made were all like nursery rhyme. Hearing that Old Xue you want to open a concert and intend to release a new song, everyone wants to try their luck.\u201d\u201cNot anyone can write out a classic song, and also not just anyone is able to sing out the classic song. It doesn\u2019t matter if there is no good song, I can just sing old songs during the concert.\u201d Joker Xue smiled slightly and replied.\u201cThat\u2019s true, rather sing old songs than allowing a lousy song to affect the quality of the concert. I am still too rushed already, how can receiving a good song be that simple.\u201d Li Fan shook his head and a trace of smile appeared on his face as he said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, those allegation news of yours are very favorable for you. Right now, the public opinion are already leaning towards us. Your fans also did not let you down, the tickets of the concert this time had already raise like crazy.\u201d\u201cDid the scalpers hoard the tickets?\u201d Joker Xue frowned slightly and said, \u201cContact the organizer and tell them that I do not want to see my fans having to spend a very huge sum of money to be able to see my concert. If things like them cooperating with the scalpers arises, I will not work together with them anymore in the future.\u201d\u201cAlright, I will contact them tomorrow.\u201d Li Fan opened a bottle of cocktail, drank 2 mouths, then said, \u201cOther people would rather hope that their tickets would sell for a higher price, while you are the exact opposite.\u201d\u201cWithout the fans, the me right now would not exist. We cannot place the cart before the horse.\u201d Joker Xue said very seriously.(\u672c\u672b\u5012\u7f6e: Place the cart before the horse \u2013 To neglect the fundamental and instead pay attention to secondary things.)\u201cUnderstood, I will ask them properly tomorrow.\u201d Li Fan nodded his head solemnly.Not talking about other things, just talking about Joker Xue\u2019s attitude towards his fans alone, Li Fan sincerely admires Joker Xue.The current celebrities right now, quite a lot of them would act like they were a big shot, but they had forgotten that the source of them being able to be a big shot was their fans.\u2026\u2026.Linhai, as the east pearl of China, Linhai was naturally very developed.Linhai\u2019s nightscape was very beautiful. At the beach, on a boat.Zi Yan was currently shooting the mv for her song. The current scene she was shooting was her looking deeply in love with a male.The background was the twinkling east pearl, and that male was Prince Li, Li Cheng, who was \u2018requested\u2019 over by the director.This scene of having to look passionately at Li Cheng made Zi Yan felt very awkward. This was already the fifth shot.Although Zi Yan was currently looking at Li Cheng, in her mind, she was trying hard to think of Meng Meng\u2019s figure. Only by doing that, then could she make her expression become somewhat gentle. However, while thinking about Meng Meng, Zhang Han\u2019s figure would float pass her mind, which made her felt somewhat baffling.\u201cAlright, we are done with this scene, let\u2019s shoot the next scene. Zi Yan, you will stand at the edge of the boat with Prince Li. It will still be this angle. After looking at each other passionately for 2 seconds, the two of you will begin kissing. Remember, the kiss has to be a bit lifelike.\u201d\u201cKiss scene?\u201dZi Yan\u2019s brows wrinkled.\u201cDidn\u2019t we said that there will be no kiss scene?\u201d Zhou Fei who was standing at one side opened her eyes wide, looked towards the director and said loudly, \u201cThe script of the music video that I saw previously didn\u2019t have a kiss scene in it right? Why was a kiss scene added in at the last moment?\u201d\u201cWhat about the script? The name of this song is called \u2018light kiss\u2019, so isn\u2019t it normal to have a kiss scene? As a celebrity, is there not a single bit of this attainment at all?\u201d Towards Zhou Fei\u2019s questioning, the director\u2019s expression sunk.\u201cHey! I have previously told you about not having a kiss scene. Don\u2019t tell me that the promise of yours at that time was a fart?\u201d Zhou Fei was somewhat angry in her heart. She knew Zi Yan\u2019s temperament. Not talking about that Zi Yan would not accept a kiss scene in the past, right now there was Meng Meng and she was also unclear with that Zhang Han, thus the more that she would not accept kiss scene. Therefore, Zhou Fei\u2019s tone was already somewhat cold.\u201cOh?\u201d Hearing that, the director felt angry in his heart as he glared and said in a very loud voice, \u201cDo you want to shoot the mv or not? Ah? Still want to get angry with me? Was it you all who requested me to help you all shoot the mv or was it me who requested you all? I will just ask you one sentence, do you want to shoot the mv or not? If you all do not want to shoot the mv, leave immediately!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Zhou Fei\u2019s brows twitched.Just when she was about to counter back, Zi Yan who was wearing a gown opened her mouth and said,\u201cShoot, but we won\u2019t shoot the kiss scene.\u201dZi Yan\u2019s tone was cold. There was also no expression on her face, making others not able to make out what she was feeling in her heart.Li Cheng who was at Zi Yan\u2019s side looked at the scene with the eye of a bystander from the start to finish. However, there was a trace of profound smile in the corner of his mouth.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - Zi Yan\u2019s powerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euZi Yan was the woman who he had his eyes on, thus he, of course, had to use some tricks. At Imperial Entertainment, no matter who he had his eyes on, there was not a time that Li Cheng had fail!Upon hearing Zi Yan\u2019s words, the director turned over, looked at her and said with a sneer,\u201cZi Yan oh Zi Yan, don\u2019t you have any bit of idea just what state you are in right now? How can a has-been celebrity become famous again without paying some price? Not talking about a mere kiss scene, even if it is a passion scene, you also have to accept it. As an older generation in the entertainment industry, don\u2019t tell me that you don\u2019t even understand this bit of logic?\u201dHearing the director\u2019s words which were just like a reprimand, a trace of light smile flashed through the depth of Li Cheng\u2019s eyes.Zi Yan\u2019s expression was still the same. With a cold tone, she said, \u201cI understand this logic, but I won\u2019t shoot the kiss scene. Also, the reason the company let you come here is to coordinate with me to shoot the mv, not for you to teach me how to do things. If you insist on adding the kiss scene, I don\u2019t mind not shooting this mv!\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201dThe director\u2019s expression became thoroughly gloomy. However, in a moment of time, he also did not have any idea in his heart. He never thought that Zi Yin would be this tough. At a loss, he secretly looked at Li Cheng, wanting to see what Li Cheng wanted to do.Seeing that the situation became cold, Li Cheng finally opened his mouth, \u201cZi Yan, how about I place a protective membrane on my lips for the kiss scene? What do you think about it?\u201dA protective membrane was like a plastic membrane, which would sometimes be used when filming a kiss scene. However, most of the time, for the kiss scene to be lifelike, the protective membrane wouldn\u2019t be used.Also, within Li Cheng\u2019s mind, protective membrane that kind of thing was able to be removed easily. During the kiss scene, just fiddle with it for a bit and it would fall off. At that time, wouldn\u2019t it be the same as having to kiss for real?Looking at Zi Yan\u2019s delicate face and alluring figure, Li Cheng\u2019s heart immediately became somewhat hot, especially Zi Yan\u2019s red lips which he looks forward to very much in the next scene.However, Zi Yan\u2019s answer caused him to be dazed.\u201cI won\u2019t shoot any kiss scene.\u201d Zi Yan rejected coldly and stiffly.Her tone was extremely resolute. No one suspected that if the director was to insist on the kiss scene, Zi Yan would definitely not shoot the mv.\u201cIt won\u2019t do even with a protective membrane?\u201dLi Cheng somewhat couldn\u2019t control his expression anymore. Under everyone\u2019s gaze, Zi Yan\u2019s continuous rejection made him felt somewhat losing face.In any case, Li Cheng was the prince of the Member of the Board of Directors, possessing a high position and Zi Yan was but a has-been celebrity. If not for having a good face, he wouldn\u2019t even pay attention to her. However, she actually didn\u2019t give Li Cheng any face right now. How could Li Cheng not felt angry about this?\u201cWon\u2019t do!\u201d Zi Yan rejected coldly once again.In the past, she did not shoot passion scene because she did not want to shoot it. And right now, she had Meng Meng, which was one more reason for her to not want to shoot passion scene.\u201cAlright.\u201dLi Cheng\u2019s gaze sunk as he said with a fake smile, \u201cYou can shoot the mv however you like.\u201dAfter finish speaking, Li Cheng left in large steps.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026.\u201d The director glared at Zi Yan, \u201cHumph! Shoot it yourself then!\u201dAfter the director spoke, he turned around and followed with quick steps towards the direction Li Cheng left.\u201cWe will shoot the mv ourselves then, who do you even think you are? Idiot.\u201d Zhou Fei took a look ferociously at the director and said loudly, \u201cCome, come, come, listen to my command and shoot the mv. With or without that director, it is still the same.\u201dUpon hearing that, the director who was leaving almost tripped over. After turning around and glared at Zhou Fei, he stormed off in a huff.Liang Mengqi stayed at a luxurious high-level sea view apartment.The neighborhood she stayed at was the same neighborhood as Joker Xue. Just that, Joker Xue\u2019s apartment was bought by himself and Liang Mengqi\u2019s apartment was rented.Currently, Liang Mengqi was lying down on her bed, using her phone, and just sent a message to a WeChat group,\u201cGuess who I met today?\u201d\u201cA handsome guy?\u201d A person who was called \u2018I am very beautiful\u2019 replied.The profile of \u2018I am very beautiful\u2019 was a guy. He seemed quite delicate and pretty, but anyone who had heard him spoke all knew that he fitted with the name very well.Because this guy was that sissy that Zhang Han met at the beach.\u201cIncorrect, it should be that you met your ex-boyfriend.\u201d A person with the internet name \u2018I am very cool\u2019 replied.This \u2018I am very cool\u2019 was the other female within the 3 of them. She had short hair and seemed somewhat like a tomboy. Also, her temperament was very candid.\u201cWhat ex-boyfriend! Do you all remember the little lady who I was going give a beverage to at the beach?\u201d Liang Mengqi replied.I am very pretty: \u201cI remember. I, of course, remember such an adorable little baby~\u201dI am very cool: \u201cCan you not be this lowly? You are disgusting me to death. Mengqi, could it be that you ran into that little girl?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I ran into that father and daughter. Hehe, you all take a guess at what that guy work as?\u201d Liang Mengqi replied.I am very pretty: \u201cLooking at that harsh look of his, could it be that he is an artist from the slum?\u201dI am very cool: \u201cI guess\u2026\u2026a gang person who looks after a place? Although he was somewhat harsh, his manliness was ample. He is much stronger than a certain sissy.\u201dBeautiful Beautiful Beautiful: \u201cUpstairs is correct.\u201dSeven Second Fish: \u201cUpstairs is correct.\u201dThere was a total of 10+ people in the WeChat group, they all belonged to the same friend circle. The people who were typing in the chat most of the time were only Liang Mengqi, sissy, and the short hair woman. Other people would only occasionally type in the chat group. The main reason for that was because that within the 3 of them, Liang Mengqi had no job, and the sissy and short hair woman had short work time, and thus was relatively free.\u201cWhere did you all guess to? That guy opens a restaurant!\u201d Liang Mengqi snorted lightly. Not intending to keep them in suspense, she typed very quickly with her fingers, \u201cLet me reveal it to you all, he opens a restaurant that is called \u2018Meng Meng\u2019s Leisure Restaurant\u2019, and his daughter is called Meng Meng. I feel that he has so much love.\u201dI am very beautiful: \u201cHe has so much love, oh, oh, oh. So that fellow is the boss of a small restaurant.\u201d\u201cHumph, his restaurant is very unique. It was even the first time I have seen it that kind of restaurant. The decor inside is just like that of a household. Also, you must not think that he is a small boss. His television wall is made with jadeite and there is also a Steinway Model O Grand Piano there. Each of it costs above a million.\u201dI am very pretty: \u201cAiya! So he is a rich man oh? Rich man, I request for a hug.\u201dI am very cool: \u201cTruly disgusting, damned sissy.\u201dSeven Second Fish: \u201cTruly disgusting, damned sissy.\u201dBeautiful Beautiful Beautiful: \u201cTruly disgusting, damned sissy.\u201d\u201cThis is not the main point!\u201d Liang Mengqi replied, \u201cThe main point is that the rice that he cooked was really, really, really fragrant. The important thing is that I said really 3 times. From I was small to big, this was the first time that I had eaten such fragrant rice. Aiya, just thinking about it now is making me hungry. My saliva is about to drip too.\u201dI am very beautiful: \u201cEn? Is that true or fake? Big miss, your mouth is so picky that I have never seen you give such an evaluation like this.\u201dSeven Second Fish: \u201cWhat kind of rice, what kind of rice, quickly say!\u201d\u201cEgg fried rice!\u201d Liang Mengqi replied.I am very cool: \u201cPfft\u2026\u2026You are trying to make me laugh?\u201d\u201cI am not joking!\u201d Liang Mengqi replied, \u201cHis egg fried rice is really, really, really fragrant. There is also cow milk too. The cow milk is the most delicious cow milk I have drank. Do you all know? This boss\u2019s temperament is really unique. He only opens for business during the time when he is cooking for his daughter. I was only able to eat the egg fried rice after waiting for quite a while. Also, a plate of egg fried rice cost 280 rmb and a cup of cow milk cost 80 rmb. But I personally feel that, don\u2019t say 280 rmb, even if his egg fried rice cost 2.8k rmb, I would also not hesitate to buy it! The egg fried rice is just too delicious already.\u201dLiang Mengqi typed out a bunch of words. This made the few others felt slightly dazed.I am very cool: \u201cTrue or fake? Is it really that delicious?\u201dBeautiful Beautiful Beautiful: \u201c/Sticking out tongue/. 280 rmb for a plate of egg fried rice and 80 rmb for a cup of cow milk. It is so expensive!\u201dI am very beautiful: \u201cHumph, why do I not believe it? No matter how it is made, isn\u2019t egg fried rice still egg fried rice? Is his egg fried rice stir-fried in heaven?\u201d\u201cI am a dog if I bluff you all!\u201d Liang Mengqi snorted lightly and replied, \u201cBelieve it or not is up to you all. In any case, I\u2019m preparing to sleep right now, I\u2019m afraid that I will not be able to wake up at 7am. If I were to miss his egg fried rice, I will not have the appetite to eat anything else.\u201dI am very cool: \u201c7am is it? I will come too!\u201dI am very beautiful: \u201cMe too!\u201d\u201cYou two give me a call before 7am then. I will go sleep first.\u201d Liang Mengqi replied and was intending to go sleep already.\u201cRing\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe phone suddenly rang. Liang Mengqi picked the phone up and discovered that it was actually her brother, Liang Hao.\u201cBrother, what are you calling me for during this late.\u201d Liang Mengqi asked.\u201cMengqi, are you at Xiangjiang right now?\u201d Liang Hao laughed and asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI am also going to go to Xiangjiang.\u201d Laing Hao said unhurriedly.\u201cAh?\u201d Liang Mengqi slightly went into a daze and asked, \u201cWhat are you coming here for? You are not going to care about the 2 companies in Singapore?\u201d\u201cI am currently preparing to hand it over to second uncle and the others. I took over the companies for 2 years and it is already enough that the market value of the 2 companies has been doubled. I will be coming to Xiangjiang to take a long vacation next.\u201d Liang Hao laughed and said.\u201cTsk! It is truly strange that those people at home would release you out. It is fine if you come too, just nice I am also quite bored being alone here.\u201d\u201cI am not going there to play this time. En\u2026\u2026I am going there this time to find Zi Yan.\u201d Liang Hao smiled slightly. Right now, his tone was somewhat gentler.\u201cZi Yan?\u201d Liang Mengqi slightly went into a daze and said, \u201cFind her for what?\u201cI am already 26 years old. The family kept on wanting to find a marriage for me, but I did not agree. Our father allowed me to settle my girlfriend problem within a year. After thinking back and forth, I feel that Zi Yan suits me the best. Also, I heard that her circumstance at Xiangjiang is not that good, I can try to help her when I come to Xiangjiang too.\u201d Liang Hao said unhurriedly.\u201cWhen are you coming to Xiangjiang?\u201d Liang Mengqi asked.\u201cThe earliest would be in a month time I guess. I have not decided on a specific time yet. I will come to Xiangjiang after I have settled the companies\u2019 affairs.\u201d Liang Hao replied.\u201cOh, alright then, I\u2019m hanging up, I still have to wake up early tomorrow to go eat egg fried rice. Bye bye.\u201dAfter speaking finish, Liang Mengqi hung up the phone. Before sleeping, Zhang Han\u2019s figure and his graceful posture when he played the piano ineffably floated pass her mind.That fellow is actually quite handsome too.Liang Mengqi muddleheadedly mumbled and gradually fell asleep.\u2026\u2026The next morning 6am+, Zhang Han and Meng Meng woke up and finished washing up.Coming to the first floor, Zhang Han opened the Apple MacBook and played songs that were pleasant to listen to.Preparing for the breakfast, Zhang Han cooked the rice and beat the eggs well.7 minutes before it was 7am, the restaurant received a customer, or more precisely, an employee from the stir fry restaurant next door.\u201cBoss, can I ask what food do your restaurant sell?\u201d An ordinary looking female who seemed to be the age of 30+ asked curiously.Liked it?

    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - Restaurant on the right trackPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThere are only egg fried rice and cow milk for the time being.\u201d Zhang Han turned his head around, took a look at the woman and replied.\u201cMainlander?\u201d The female slightly went into a daze. From Zhang Han\u2019s Mandarin, she could make out that he was a mainlander. In her gaze, a trace of disdain couldn\u2019t help but flash through her gaze.Zhang Han took a look at her indifferently and did not pay attention to her.When a mainlander spoke Mandarin, there would always be some Xiangjiang natives who would reveal out expression of disdain. This was not really discrimination and was instead a kind of dislike.Remember when Zhang Han chat with Zhang Li, Zhang Li spoke about this matter. After coming to Xiangjiang for a few years, she also understood why the natives dislike the mainlanders.She said that a lot of mainlanders would use various kinds of methods to give birth in Xiangjiang\u2019s hospitals, forcing quite a lot of native pregnant woman to have to go to private hospitals that were more expensive. Gradually, the spots of private hospitals were also snatched. You think that you are rich? Sorry, mainlanders are much richer than you. It was so serious to the point that later on, Xiangjiang\u2019s government released out a statute that restricts mainlander pregnant woman to come to Xiangjiang to give birth. This statute was met with various kinds of protest. Every time when it was the weekend, especially during public holiday, large quantities of mainlanders would go to Xiangjiang to shop. During that time, there would be mainlanders who don\u2019t queue up, shout loudly, crossing road during a red light\u2026\u2026There would also be a lot of goods being bought frenetically until it was sold out.Due to various reasons, Xiangjiang natives dislike mainlanders. But in actual fact, when a forest became big, there would be all kind of birds in it. In every place, there would be both high and low inner quality people. There were also a lot of scums who were Xiangjiang natives too. Just that, there was just too many mainlanders who goes to Xiangjiang.However, towards this kind of gaze, Zhang Han had always chosen to disregard it.Why would an ant-eater care about the gaze of a mere ant?Don\u2019t talk about Xiangjiang natives, even if it was foreigners, aliens, or cultivators, Zhang Han wouldn\u2019t care too.\u201cJust those two? I will have a plate of egg fried rice and a cup of cow milk then.\u201d The female took out her wallet and asked, \u201cHow much is the total?\u201d\u201cA plate of egg fried rice is 280 rmb and a cup of cow milk is 80 rmb.\u201d Zhang Han said, \u201cIf you want to eat, you will have to wait for half an hour.\u201d\u201cThat expensive? Forget it then.\u201d The female put away her wallet very quickly. After taking a look at Zhang Han very disdainfully, she turned around and left.After leaving, she went back to the Chuangxiang Restaurant that was next door in quick steps.The decor and layout of the inside of the restaurant were quite good. The restaurant\u2019s focus was spicy Chuan dishes, and the chef was also hired from Xichuan with a high price.Because there was not much business in the morning, therefore it was quite idle, and the attendants were only in charge of cleaning the restaurant in the morning. Right now, the restaurant\u2019s manager and 5 attendants were sitting on a round table that was situated beside the door.\u201cManager, manager, I went to take a look already. The restaurant at the side is opened by a mainlander.\u201d The female returned hurriedly and said as she sat down on the chair.\u201cOpened by a mainlander?\u201d\u201cAnother mainlander who wants to come to Crescent Gulf to fish for a quick buck.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe few attendants discussed for a bit. The manager muttered to himself for a bit and said, \u201cWhat food does that restaurant sell?\u201dThe female\u2019s expression paused for a while, with a trace of laughing in her tone, she spoke out 3 words, \u201cEgg fried rice.\u201dEveryone first went into a daze for a while. Soon after, they all burst out laughing.\u201cThere is also cow milk too.\u201d The female quickly added on, \u201cGuess how much he is selling those two items? A plate of egg fried rice cost 280 rmb and a cup of milk cost 80 rmb.\u201dThose words immediately made the few attendants went into a daze.\u201cHaha, has he gone mad from thinking about earning money?\u201d A 20+ years old male sneered.\u201cIs he even opening a restaurant? It would be strange if he can even have customers!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, does he think that he is a chef god? To sell the food that expensive, he is not trying to be funny right?\u201dWhile discussing spiritedly, the few people could see the trace of sneer in each other\u2019s eyes. Although they didn\u2019t say it out, in their heart, they felt that there was definitely a problem with the boss\u2019s mental.\u201cThis is really interesting.\u201d The middle age manager laughed and shook his head, \u201cI was wondering why the customers that went into that restaurant during the past 2 days all left in less than 2 minutes. So it was a problem with the price.\u201dAs he spoke, the manager couldn\u2019t help but laugh out. Looking towards the female, he asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you try and see what the taste of an egg fried rice that costs 280 rmb taste like?\u201d\u201cI am also not sick.\u201d The female curled her lips and laughed.In her heart, she felt that eating a plate of egg fried rice that costs 280 rmb was the action that a sick person would do.If it was according to her statement, right now, 3 \u2018sick\u2019 people had arrived at the front of Zhang Han\u2019s restaurant.\u201cBoss, when will the rice be done?\u201d Liang Mengqi walked into the restaurant with a smile.\u201c20 minutes.\u201d Zhang Han took a look at her and replied.\u201cWe will wait for a while then.\u201d Liang Mengqi said. When she saw that the sissy was walking towards the big dining table that Zhang Han uses, she hurriedly reminded, \u201cHey, hey, this side is where the customers are supposed to sit at.\u201d\u201cWhat? We cannot sit wherever we want?\u201d The sissy slightly went into a daze.\u201cWhat did you think? That place is the place the boss and his daughter eat at.\u201d Liang Mengqi rolled her eyes at him and took the lead to sit on the chair that was at the dining table where the customers were supposed to sit at. The short hair female did not say anything and straightforwardly sat at the opposite of Liang Mengqi.\u201cSuch a small dining table? Shoot! Mengqi, you are not trolling us, right? Where do I sit at if you two sit here?\u201d The sissy said indignantly.\u201cIsn\u2019t there space at the table beside us? Don\u2019t dawdle and quickly sit down. If not, you can go and wait outside!\u201d The short hair female glared at him.\u201cAlright, alright, alright, I will sit at the side okay? Gosh! I will tell you all, if this egg fried rice here doesn\u2019t suit my taste, I am going to shoot abuses in the street!\u201d The sissy snorted lightly.\u201cYou are truly lowly to the point that my scalp is going numb!\u201d The short hair female rolled her eyes.\u201cHahaha\u2026the two of you, a sissy and a muscular woman, what a truly matching pair.\u201d Liang Mengqi laughed lightly.The sissy\u2019s name was Zhao Dahu, a very strong-willed name, but a very sissy person. The short hair female\u2019s name was Yu Qingqing, a very gentle name, and she has a very candid temperament. What was more interesting was that, this Zhao Dahu had been persistently chasing after Yu Qingqing, and had already chased after her for close to 2 years already.\u201cWho is matching with him, I don\u2019t like this sissy at all!\u201d Yu Qingqing said petulantly.\u201cHumph! I just like masculine woman.\u201d Zhao Dahu mumbled to himself. Soon after, he sized up the inside of the restaurant and said, \u201cDoes the decor of this restaurant even looks like that of a restaurant? Just 3 small tables for customers\u2026I reckon that fellow doesn\u2019t even have the sincerity to open a restaurant.\u201d\u201cWhat does the restaurant\u2019s decor have anything to do with you? Can you not be so nosy?\u201d Yu Qingqing turned her head and slapped onto Zhao Dahu\u2019s shoulder.\u201cAlright, alright, alright, I won\u2019t say anymore okay?\u201d Zhao Dahu twisted his body for a bit and said, \u201cAlthough this restaurant doesn\u2019t seem like a restaurant, the decor of this restaurant\u2019s is quite unique. There is actually really a jadeite wall there huh. I must say, the Steinway Model O Grand Piano is very cool, just that, I don\u2019t know if that is purely a decoration item or not.\u201d\u201cLet me tell you, Sissy Zhao.\u201d Liang Mengqi pouted her mouth towards Zhang Han and said, \u201cHis piano skill does not pale in comparison to Liang Zong\u2019s piano skill.\u201d\u201cTrue or fake? He is that good?\u201d Yu Qingqing said somewhat amazed.\u201cOh, oh, oh, Mengqi, from what I see, could it be that you have fallen for that old man? Bragging so much about that guy, tsk, tsk.\u201d Zhao Dahu said eccentrically. While talking, his nose suddenly smelled something, and said bewilderedly, \u201cEh? Is this the smell of sheep milk? It smells so fragrant.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, this milk seems to be very pure.\u201d Yu Qingqing also spoke about the smell of the cow milk. Turning her gaze towards the direction of the smell, she saw that Zhang Han was currently pouring out 2 glasses of goat milk, and within the pot, there seems to still some goat milk left. The goat milk was piping hot and the milk fragrant drifted about in the restaurant.\u201cGrumble, grumble\u2026\u2026\u201d Liang Mengqi\u2019s stomach grumbled as she sub-consciously stuck out her tongue and licked her sexy lips and mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m almost at my limit already.\u201dAfter waiting urgently, finally, the torturing 20 minutes had passed.\u201cMeng Meng, let\u2019s go eat.\u201d Zhang Han placed the breakfast on the dining table, walked to the sofa and carried Meng Meng who was still watching the cartoon with great interest.\u201cTime to eat!\u201d Meng Meng raised her little arms while she was within Zhang Han\u2019s embrace and cheered. When she sat at the dining table, she finally saw Liang Mengqi and the 2 other people.\u201cEh, big sister is here?\u201d Meng Meng waved her little palm.\u201cGood morning Meng Meng.\u201d Liang Mengqi smiled sweetly. When she smiled, on the right side of her cheek, there was a small dimple.\u201cGood morning Meng Meng.\u201d Zhao Dahu and Yu Qingqing also smiled and greeted.\u201cGood morning. Humph.\u201d Meng Meng first greeted them politely. Soon after, she remembered the words that the 2 of them spoke at the beach, and thus snorted lightly, then turned her head back, picked up her spoon and began eating the breakfast.\u201cThe utensils are on the counter. The rice is inside the rice pot, go get the rice yourself. The big pot beside the rice pot is cow milk and the small pot is sheep milk.\u201d Zhang Han said towards the 3 people.\u201cAlright.\u201d Liang Mengqi stood up and walked towards the counter excitedly.Yu Qingqing slightly wrinkled her brows.Opening a restaurant, yet making the customers get the food themselves. This was still the first time she had met with this kind of thing. It was fine if you opened a buffet, but the crucial point is that you are actually a small restaurant that sells egg fried rice!\u201cHumph!\u201d Zhao Dahu rolled his eyes at Zhang Han and walked to the counter while swinging his hips.\u201cIt is actually really just purely egg fried rice. There are only egg and rice, and the chopped onion in the egg fried rice is also this less. However, the smell seems to be still okay.\u201d Zhao Dahu took a sniff. After the 2 females had taken their egg fried rice, he also took a plate of egg fried rice for himself.For the cow milk and sheep milk, the 3 of them all chose the sheep milk since they had often drunk cow milk and rarely drank sheep milk.Just that, after Zhao Dahu and Yu Qingqing finished pouring the sheep milk, they were dazed when they turned around.It could be seen that, Liang Mengqi walked back to the dining table in quick steps, and right after she placed her breakfast on the dining table, she immediately began devouring the egg fried rice.Looking at the way Liang Mengqi ate, the 2 of them somewhat felt that she seemed to have not eaten for 3 days.\u201cIs it really that delicious?\u201d Yu Qingqing and Zhao Dahu took a look at each other and mumbled.\u201cLet\u2019s go and try how it tastes!\u201d Zhao Dahu said and the 2 of them quickly walked back to the dining table.After sitting down, Yu Qingqing looked at Liang Mengqi who didn\u2019t even raise her head and felt somewhat dazed again. Snapping out of it, she took a spoon of egg fried rice and placed it into her mouth. The immediate moment when she tasted the taste of the egg fried rice, her eyes gradually became bigger and bigger.This\u2026\u2026is this really egg fried rice?\u201dSuspicion actually arose within Yu Qingqing\u2019s heart. She closed her eyes and chewed a few times. After she swallowed the egg fried rice, her entire body immediately felt relaxed.Remember that a chef god once said this, \u201cThe joy in culinary delicacy is that it could make a person\u2019s heart and soul be absorbed into it when they eat it, just like entering into a wonderful trip of gustatory delight.\u201dYu Qingqing was just like that right now. She was incomparably enchanted with eating the egg fried rice.Faintly, she seemed to have heard Zhao Dahu\u2019s sobbing sound from behind.\u201cBoohoohoo\u2026\u2026This is too delicious already, this is really too delicious already\u2026\u2026This isn\u2019t even egg fried rice, this is practically life\u2026\u2026\u201dLiked it?

    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 - The Temptation of FoodPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euYu Qingqing ate the egg fried rice with a blurred expression. Even when there was no more egg fried rice in her plate, she was also totally unaware of it and was still moving her spoon to pick up the egg fried rice. After moving a few times, Yu Qingqing finally discovered that she had already eaten finish the plate of egg fried rice.\u201cBoss, I want another plate\u2026\u2026\u201dYu Qingqing only felt that she was much hungrier after eating that plate of egg fried rice, thus, without even thinking about it, she said out the sentence.\u201cGo get it yourself then.\u201d Without turning his head, Zhang Han replied indifferently.\u201cOh.\u201d Yu Qingqing nodded her head. When she stood up, she saw that Liang Mengqi had already gotten another plate of egg fried rice and another cup of milk and was walking back to the dining table.Oh, that\u2019s right, I haven\u2019t drink the sheep milk yet.While Yu Qingqing was eating the egg fried rice, she completely forgot about the surroundings and had even forgotten about the sheep milk that was beside her plate.Thus, Yu Qingqing hurriedly picked up the cup of sheep milk.Drinking it in one gulp, Yu Qingqing couldn\u2019t help but closed her eyes and experience the taste of the sheep milk. After drinking it, the taste still lingered in her memory.\u201cQingqing.\u201d Liang Mengqi had after all eaten a plate already and her consciousness was back to normal at the moment. Calling out to Yu Qingqing, she couldn\u2019t help but reminded her, \u201cThere is only a plate worth of egg fried rice in the rice pot. If you want to eat it, you have to be quick.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dLiang Mengqi\u2019s words pulled Yu Qingqing back to reality. After coming back to her senses, she rushed to the counter with lightning fast speed and immediately transferred all the remaining egg fried rice that was in the rice pot to her plate. There was no more sheep milk, so she poured herself a cup of cow milk instead. After finishing all those, she walked back to the dining table leisurely.After placing down her plate and cup, she took a look at Liang Mengqi and discovered that Liang Mengqi was eating very slowly. After thinking about it for a bit, she came to an understanding. There was only those egg fried rice left, so naturally, she would have to eat it slowly and properly enjoy the taste of the egg fried rice.After they had finished eating, the 2 of them faintly heard a sobbing sound coming from Zhao Dahu\u2019s direction.\u201cEh?\u201dThe 2 of them stood up and walked to the front of Zhao Dahu. Upon seeing Zhao Dahu, they discovered that Zhao Dahu was actually really crying.\u201cWhat are you crying for?\u201d Yu Qingqing said petulantly.\u201cBoohoo\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhao Dahu ate the egg fried rice while sobbing at the same time, \u201cIt is too delicious already\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it is delicious, then it is delicious. What is there to cry for?\u201d Liang Mengqi said while laughing.\u201cI have to leave for a business trip next week. Once I leave, it is going to be for half a year. It was already very hard to not be able to see my Qingqing for half a year. But right now, after eating such a delicious egg fried rice, I\u2019m afraid that I will starve to death when I leave for my business trip.\u201d Zhao Dahu said very sadly.\u201cLook at you this sissy look. Didn\u2019t you want to change a company since long ago? If you don\u2019t want to leave for the business trip, you can just resign!\u201d Yu Qingqing rolled her eyes at him.Although Zhao Dahu\u2019s name seemed very strong-willed, his temperament was quite indecisive and was relatively sissy. Adding his tone with his originally delicate and pretty looks, it made him seemed even more sissy. This made Yu Qingqing felt really anxious in her heart!If he was to be a bit more strong-willed, wouldn\u2019t I have accepted him long ago?Tsk, who would accept him!Yu Qingqing spat at herself in her heart.\u201cThat\u2019s right, if you were to leave for the business trip for half a year, after you come back, I reckon that Yu Qingqing would have already been chased by someone else.\u201d Liang Mengqi teased.\u201cWhat?\u201dZhao Dahu went into a daze. His eyes looked around for a while, and after a while, with a red face, he said resolutely, \u201cI go will and resign later on then! Eat! I will eat 3 plates of egg fried rice today! After eating finish, I will go and find the head and have a good talk with him. Humph!\u201d\u201cPfft\u2026\u2026\u201d When Liang Mengqi saw Zhao Dahu speaking such resolute words in such an \u2018effeminate\u2019 way, she couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cA dog can\u2019t stop himself from eating sh*t!\u201d Yu Qingqing\u2019s tone was filled with helplessness. Pulling onto Liang Mengqi\u2019s hand, she went back to the dining table and slowly tasted the cow milk.\u201cMengqi, the food here is really as delicious as you described. How could an egg fried rice be cooked this deliciously? I totally can\u2019t imagine it at all. Don\u2019t say 280 rmb, even if it was 2.8k rmb, I would also feel that it was worth it.\u201d Yu Qingqing drank small mouthfuls of cow milk while sighing at the same time.\u201cWhen I ate it for the first time, I myself also couldn\u2019t believe it. But the fact was that, the food here was just that delicious. Furthermore\u2026\u2026\u201d When Liang Mengqi spoke halfway, 2 middle age man suddenly walked into the restaurant.\u201cExcuse me, what breakfast do you have here?\u201d The cultured and refined looking middle age man asked.\u201cWe are sold out.\u201d After Zhang Han used the wet towel to wipe his hands, he turned his head around and said.\u201cYou are sold out that fast? Won\u2019t it do if you cook another breakfast on the spot?\u201d The middle age man asked confusedly.\u201cNo time.\u201d Zhang Han replied indifferently.When Zhang Han said that, everyone who was present all slightly went into a daze.You open a restaurant and yet you tell your customers that you don\u2019t have the time to cook?Those words also made the expression of the 2 middle age man to become somewhat stiff, and evidently revealing out a dissatisfied expression. However, the 2 of them did not say anything and just left while slightly wrinkling their brows.At this time, Liang Mengqi took a look at Yu Qingqing whose gaze was somewhat sluggish. Laughing slightly, she continued, \u201cFurthermore, the boss\u2019s restaurant is only open for business when he is cooking for his daughter. The restaurant isn\u2019t open for business during normal business hours. You should know how hard it is to eat his food now right?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026is it very hard.\u201d A trace of grave expression appeared on Yu Qingqing\u2019s face as she said, \u201cSeems like we will have to come on time next time. If the egg fried rice was to be tasted by other people, it will be very bad!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Liang Mengqi asked curiously. Such good food like this, there was most likely no foodie who would be able to resist it. Not being able to eat the restaurant\u2019s food could be even counted as a kind of regret. Letting other people taste the food of the restaurant and blessing the foodies, isn\u2019t it quite a wonderful thing?\u201cYou think about it.\u201d Yu Qingqing said with a heavy expression, \u201cIf other people were to know how delicious the food here is, with just that tiny amount of food that the boss cooks every time, wouldn\u2019t it cause us to not be able to have enough to eat?\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dLaing Mengqi\u2019s expression changed slightly and was shocked by just thinking about it.Thinking about having to queue up when she comes to the restaurant to eat in the future, yet not being to eat a single grain of egg fried rice after queuing for half a day, just the thought of it was enough to make her feel afraid!\u201cIt won\u2019t do! We will have to come the earliest in the future, we cannot let others be in front of us.\u201d Liang Mengqi said anxiously.\u201cActually, I have a method to solve this problem.\u201d Yu Qingqing\u2019s eyes shined as she said with a mysterious smile.\u201cWhat method?\u201d Lang Mengqi asked hurriedly.\u201cThat is\u2026\u2026\u201d Yu Qingqing stretched her head to the front and said in a small voice, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it do if you chase until that fellow? You can get an adorable daughter for free, and we would also be able to eat such fragrant food every day. Furthermore, you look at him, he is actually quite handsome, isn\u2019t he? Also, he has good taste, knows how to cook delicious food, and even knows how to take care of people. He is definitely the best choice as your other half!\u201dAfter Liang Mengqi listened to what Yu Qingqing said, her eyes gradually opened bigger and bigger.\u201cWhat are you even saying!\u201d Liang Mengqi\u2019s face immediately became red and her expression was somewhat shy.\u201cLook at that blushing expression of yours. Wait for me, I will go and ask him.\u201d Yu Qingqing grinned, stood up and walked towards the dining table that Zhang Han was at.\u201cHey, hey, hey, what are you doing, quickly come back\u2026\u2026\u201d Liang Mengqi did not know why, upon seeing that, her heart started jumping and she became anxious. This kind of nervous feeling made her felt somewhat at a loss and helpless, and even made her to not dare to turn her head around to see what would happen next.The shyness only occupied a small part in her heart, most of it was her feeling embarrassed about this kind of thing. She felt that the since the boss already has a daughter, he would definitely have a wife too, and she herself would also not go and be someone\u2019s mistress. Yu Qingqing is very candid. If she were to say anything that she isn\u2019t supposed to say, how will I be able to come to face with the boss in the future?While contemplating, Liang Mengqi stuck up her ears, preparing to listen to what Yu Qingqing was going to say. If she were to say anything that was too excessive, she will stand up and stop her.Luckily, although Yu Qingqing was candid, she was not reckless.\u201cBoss, the egg fried rice that you cook is really delicious! It is the first time that I had eaten such a fragrant and delicious egg fried rice, you are too awesome!\u201d Yu Qingqing raised her thumb towards Zhang Han and said.\u201cEn.\u201d Zhang Han smiled slightly.\u201cOf course, my daddy is very, very awesome.\u201d After drinking the last mouth of milk, Meng Meng patted her small tummy and said with a proud face.\u201cHahaha, Meng Meng, since you are this adorable and pretty, your mother is definitely also very pretty right?\u201d Yu Qingqing laughed and asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, mommy she is very pretty.\u201d Meng Meng giggled and said.\u201cBoss, you are so blessed to have a beautiful wife and an adorable child, I\u2019m so envious of you. How many years have you been married for?\u201d Yu Qingqing asked curiously.\u201cI haven\u2019t married yet.\u201d Zhang Han slightly shook his head and replied. After finish speaking, he carried Meng Meng.\u201cThen\u2026Meng Meng is\u2026\u2026\u201d Yu Qingqing hurriedly asked.\u201cMy blood daughter.\u201d Without turning his head, Zhang Han replied as he carried Meng Meng and walked towards the sofa.\u201cOh.\u201dA trace of excitement flashed through Yu Qingqing\u2019s face. She hurriedly walked back to the dining table and said secretly, \u201cMengqi, your chance is here. Did you hear it just now? He is definitely divorced! Wahahaha, that\u2019s great, if Mengqi you were to be able to settle him, you will, in turn, be blessing us!\u201d\u201cTsk, don\u2019t anyhow say!\u201d Liang Mengqi rolled her eyes petulantly at Yu Qingqing and said, \u201cWe will just eat our food honestly and not do anything. Let me tell you, don\u2019t anyhow try to match two people together!\u201d\u201cHow can this be called anyhow? Isn\u2019t he handsome?\u201d Yu Qingqing said.\u201cIn the past, I didn\u2019t feel that he was handsome, but right now I feel that he is especially handsome. For a person to be able to cook such delicious food and also be able to play the piano that well, it is very rare.\u201d Liang Mengqi replied honestly.\u201cIsn\u2019t it settle then? His handsome and you are pretty, what an ideal couple!\u201d Yu Qingqing said with a smile.\u201cI\u2019m not talking with you anymore.\u201d Liang Mengqi snorted lightly.\u201cPhew\u2026\u2026I finally finished eating! This feels great, this feels so great! I still want to eat 2 more plates!\u201d Zhao Dahu finally finished eating now. In a moment, he felt that his entire body was relaxed and felt very great.\u201cEat what eat, there is no more egg fried rice already!\u201d Yu Qingqing pouted her mouth.\u201cAh? There is no more? I still haven\u2019t eaten full yet!\u201d Zhao Dahu immediately became stupefied.\u201cWho told you to eat so slowly.\u201d Yu Qingqing rolled her eyes at him.\u201cSigh, alright.\u201d Zhao Dahu laughed bitterly. However, in the next moment, his expression changed, as he stood up with a serious expression and said with an extremely resolute tone, \u201cLet\u2019s go! For Qingqing, and for this egg fried rice! I have decided to go resign right now. I won\u2019t work at that company starting from today!\u201d\u201cOh, oh, oh, Sissy Zhao is actually resolute now?\u201d Yu Qingqing curled her lips and laughed. Afterward, she stood up, took out her wallet, counted the money, looked towards Zhang Han and said, \u201cBoss, pay the bill.\u201d\u201cJust place the money on the table will do.\u201d Zhang Han was still tidying up the kitchen. Without raising his head, he replied.\u201cAlright.\u201d Yu Qingqin replied and straightforwardly placed the bill of the 3 of them on the table.\u201cBoss, what time will you be opened for business during noon?\u201d Laing Mengqi asked.\u201c12pm+.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cWe will come again at 12pm.\u201d Liang Mengqi smiled sweetly, turned around and left.Liked it?

    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 - This is the song I wantPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euAfter Zhang Han tidied up the kitchen, he took a cloth and came to the white color dining table.He picked up the bunch of 100 rmb notes on the table, and without looking at all, he placed it into the drawer of the computer counter.The 3 of them ate a total of 5 plates of egg fried rice and 6 cups of milk. Yu Qingqing had a delightful meal and straightforwardly left 2.1k rmb. If it was counted normally, 5 plates of egg fried rice were 1.4k rmb and 6 cups of milk were 480 rmb. In total, just 1880 rmb was enough.But Yu Qingqing did not count it like that. She counted a plate of egg fried rice as 300 rmb and a cup of milk as 100 rmb, which was 1.5k rmb + 600 rmb, 2.1k rmb.However, Zhang Han was also lazy to bother counting the money. To him, money was just a number. Although he did not have much money right now, Zhang Han had never worry about him not having money to spend in the future.After throwing away all the utensils on the table into the rubbish bin and wiped the table, his phone rang.Taking a look at the time, it was only 8am right now. The phone call that was coming at this timing was the time where Zi Yan would call to chat with Meng Meng.\u201cZhang Han.\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s voice sounded nimble as usual, but Zhang Han could still make out a bit of exhaustion in her voice.\u201cEn.\u201d\u201cEvery time when I call you, all you do is, ah, ah, en, en. Are you that not willing to talk to me?\u201d There was some discontent in Zi Yan\u2019s voice.Not knowing why, every time when she heard Zhang Han \u2018ah\u2019 or \u2018en\u2019 indifferently, Zi Yan would always feel angry! If she was at his side, without thinking at all, Zi Yan would definitely reprimand him.Whereas Zhang Han himself, he would feel baffled every time.You only call out my name when you call me, what else do you even want me to say to you?After remaining silent on the phone for a moment, Zi Yan\u2019s voice became cold as she said, \u201cPass the phone to Meng Meng, I want to talk with her!\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head and walked towards Meng Meng. After muttering to himself for a bit, he decided to ask, \u201cHow is the shooting of the mv? Hearing your tone, you seem to be somewhat exhausted.\u201d\u201cHumph! This is more like human words!\u201d Zi Yan snorted lightly. Her tone became somewhat gentler as she said, \u201cI am indeed quite exhausted. I had to shoot until morning 3am yesterday and had only slept for 4 hours. In a while, I still have to go to the outskirts to continue shooting. The mv must be finished shooting by the 10th and I will be coming back to rest for a day during the 11th. On the 12th, there is a commercial performance at Victoria Harbor, on the 13th, I have to go and look at the final manufacturing of the song, and on the 14th, I have to announce the news conference.\u201dHearing that, Zhang Han brows wrinkled slightly and said, \u201cIs there a need to work so hard?\u201dIt was the information age right now. Release a few good quality songs at home, and if bored, go and open 2 concerts was enough already.For Zi Yan to have to shoot mv, do commercial performance, announce news conference and so on other works, it seemed somewhat excessive in Zhang Han\u2019s eyes. If not for having drank the Pure-Yang Water, Zi Yan would be feeling 2 times more exhausted right now.Furthermore, things like celebrities and money, in the end, they are nothing but floating clouds. With my identity of a cultivator, when all is said and done, in the future, I will be bringing Meng Meng and my family and depart from earth. After all, when a person succeeds, all his people benefit too. Eh\u2026\u2026Zi Yan should\u2026more or less be counted as a part of my family right?\u201cI also want to properly accompany Meng Meng, but I cannot, I have to earn money. I want to be able to give Meng Meng good education and let her live a worriless life. Moreover, I still have not gotten the honor of best actress. I had retired for 5 years, and in this age where information spreads very fast, everyone is about to forget about me already. Thus, for my come back, I have to work much harder compared to others to be able to succeed.\u201d Zi Yan said unhurriedly.Actually, she was also carrying a very huge pressure. Being in her kind of situation, no matter who was it, they would also feel a huge pressure on them. At this time, a woman would extremely need a man to help her share the pressure. But in Zi Yan\u2019s eyes, with Zhang Han\u2019s temperament and his view towards show business, she felt that there was no way that he would be of any help to her.\u201cEn, you figure it out for yourself then. When you are outside, take good care of your health. You don\u2019t have to keep thinking about earning money, with me here, the family won\u2019t be lacking money to spend.\u201d Zhang Han muttered for a while, then, very naturally, said out words of concern.\u201cThank you.\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s voice became somewhat gentler one more time as she said with a somewhat smiling tone, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I heard Meng Meng saying that the food you cook is very delicious?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201dZhang Han replied.\u201cHumph! To be so confident, seems like you really have some skills in cooking huh?\u201d Zi Yan snorted with a smile and said, \u201cAlso, don\u2019t instill Meng Meng with whatever insects or not education anymore. If not, when I come back, I will definitely show you some colors. Alright, pass the phone to Meng Meng, I want to speak with her.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dZhang Han slightly went into a daze. Unknowingly, he had stood beside the sofa and chatted with Zi Yan for 5 minutes already. He passed the phone to Meng Meng who was watching the cartoon on the television, and when Meng Meng heard her mommy\u2019s voice, Meng Meng stopped watching the television and began chatting with her mommy.This chat went on for half an hour before coming to a stop, as Zi Yan had to go to work. Meng Meng said goodbye very obediently, then hang up the phone.During the entire morning, 10+ waves of customers came to the restaurant in succession. The restaurant\u2019s position was not bad, and through the clear glass, the restaurant\u2019s unique d\u00e9cor could be seen. That crystal chandelier that was on top of the dining table, the piano which seems extremely graceful, the extremely tidy decor, and various other reasons attracted quite a lot of customers to the restaurant.But because Zhang Han was not cooking, all those people could only sigh and leave.Zhang Han muttered to himself for a bit, it is not good if it continues like this, thus Zhang Han placed a notice at the front of the restaurant\u2019s door.Opening hours: Morning, 07.00-08.00, noon, 12.00-13.00, night, 18.00-19.00, not necessarily opened for business every day, do not disturb during non-business hours.Food: Egg fried rice 280 rmb per plate, cow milk 80 rmb per cup, will occasionally have sheep milk, 80 rmb per cup.The opening hours that was like a tyrant clause was already very unscientific when seen by people, but the price of the food, when seen by people, it would make those people who didn\u2019t know the truth to feel somewhat resent.Only selling egg fried rice and the price is even that expensive? Only ghosts would come to this restaurant.After Zhang Han finished making the notice, the female staff member of the spicy Chuanla Restaurant next door came to take a few looks out of curiosity. When she saw the information written on the notice, she held back her smile and went back to the restaurant. Another mocking and ridicule were about to undergo again in the restaurant next door.At the same time, Joker Xue\u2019s house.\u201cAiya! What rubbish are those? This is worrying me to death!\u201d Li Fan took off the headphone irritatedly and said fumingly, \u201cGod sake, to even dare to send over a song that had been researched for less than half a year, I truly can\u2019t believe it. Forget about them sending it over, but even the music sheet is also not complete. Could it be that they are trying to play with us a game of listening to songs and filling up the music sheet?\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201d Joker Xue laughed slightly and said, \u201cI will listen to the songs during the afternoon, you can go and have a rest first. I feel that if you continue on listening, you are going to turn insane.\u201d\u201cI am already insane, I\u2019m insanely hungry.\u201d Li Fan\u2019s stomach grumbled. He stood up and said, \u201cI will go cook a bowl of instant noodle to eat.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t, how about we go out eat? You have been working really work during those few days, let us go out and improve our food.\u201d Joker Xue asked.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it also doesn\u2019t hold up the time for me to listen to the songs when I cook a bowl of instant noodle. The concert is only in a few more days, there is not much time left. The concert will only be counted as complete if there are 2 good songs.\u201d Li Fan shook his head.Although those sponsors, business and variety shows could not be retrieved, the public onion was no longer one-sided and the fans were also very supportive of Joker Xue. Furthermore, in those 2 days, a smile would occasionally appear on Joker Xue\u2019s face. When Li Fan saw that, he felt somewhat relieved in his heart.\u201cHow about we order some food to eat then? Don\u2019t eat instant noodles anymore.\u201d Joker Xue placed down the guitar that was in his hand and took out his phone, intending to order some food.\u201cAlright, I want an 8-inch pizza, 2 medium rare steaks, and some desserts and snacks.\u201d Hearing that, Li Fan smiled and sat back down in front of the computer table.\u201cYou are not polite with me in the least bit huh!\u201d Joker Xue scolded and laughed.Li Fan had been following him for more than 4 years already. Li Fan was earnest in his work and was also responsible and diligent. The relationship between the 2 of them was very good and they would often joke around with each other in private.\u201cWhere is there such thing as an employee being polite with his boss.\u201dLi Fan grinned and put on the headphone. His gaze looked towards the computer screen once again as he opened the next email.This song\u2019s name was called \u2018actor\u2019.\u201cEh? I feel that the song name is okay, but I reckon the content is a bunch of nonsense again. The information is quite complete, there is even a piece of tuned piano music\u2026En? What is this thing? This song actually asked for a price of 100k rmb? Crap! Is the person insane?\u201dLi Fan shouted out loudly.Normally, within the income of a song, the songwriter would receive 5% royalty, the singer would be able to receive 20-40%, and the rest would go to the music company. But because of pirating, all those percentage earnings were actually not that high. Furthermore, sometimes, the copyright of good songs was buy out entirely by one side, and the price would normally be at around 50k to 60k rmb. Only those somewhat famous songwriters would be able to sell a song at the price of above 100k rmb.And Li Fan was familiar with all those songwriters who were qualified, and there was no one who was called \u2018Han Yang\u2019.For a new guy to dare to ask for the price of 100k rmb, in Li Fan\u2019s eyes, the new guy was somewhat arrogant.\u201cOh? A 100k rmb song huh? Play it with the stereo sound system, I want to listen to it too.\u201dEven Joker Xue himself was curious about the song.\u201cLet us listen to this so-called 100k rmb song then!\u201d Li Fan sneered, took off the headphone, plugged in the cable of the stereo sound system and began playing the song accompaniment.When the melodious and solemn piano accompaniment played, Li Fan slightly went into a daze.\u201cThis is interesting!\u201dLi Fan\u2019s expression immediately became extremely serious as he began listening to the accompaniment attentively.And Joker Xue himself had already closed his eyes to enjoy the song accompaniment.Unknowingly, they listened finish to the entire accompaniment.\u201cFinally a song that seems to be the deal. Let us listen to the tuned piano music.\u201d Li Fan said and began playing the piano music.After finish listening to the tuned piano music, Li Fan\u2019s brows twitched as he took a look at Joker Xue and said deeply, \u201cI feel that\u2026\u2026the premium song has arrived!\u201d\u201cTake a look at the lyrics!\u201dJoker Xue hurriedly moved over.\u201cSimply, talk simply. Please ignore the recent state of mind. You aren\u2019t an actor. Don\u2019t make up any of those plots\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter finish looking at the lyrics, Li Fan\u2019s expression was already somewhat excited as he said trembling,\u201cGood, good, good! The lyrics of this song is really good! This is great! I feel that if this song was to sing out by you, it will definitely, definitely be perfect!\u201d\u201cActor\u2026\u2026\u201d Joker Xue\u2019s gaze was somewhat absent-minded as he mumbled, \u201cThis is the song that I want!\u201dLiked it?

    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - Master PianistPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euThe both of them listened to the piano accompaniment for a number of times. Even when the delivery man knocked on the door, Li Fan was somewhat unwilling to go and open the door. After taking the food, Li Fan placed the food casually at one side, walked back to the computer table and continued studying the song, \u2018actor\u2019.Evidently, this song had already conquered the 2 of them and made the 2 of them completely forgot about their hunger.After studying the song for 3 hours, Joker Xue took a microphone, played the accompaniment, and began singing.Li Fan listened infatuatedly to Joker Xue\u2019s singing.\u201cSimply, talk simply. Please ignore the recent state of mind. You aren\u2019t an actor. Don\u2019t make up any of those plots\u2026\u2026\u201dJoker Xue\u2019s deep and low voice completely interpreted out the various feelings that were in the song. It was just like that like he had bestowed the song with a life.This was one of the reason that this song of his could become popular.It must be said that, Joker Xue\u2019s singing fundamentals were very deep. When he sang it for the first time, he was already more or less able to grasp how to sing the song.After Joker Xue started singing, he couldn\u2019t stop singing. After singing for close to 3 hours, then did Joker Xue stopped. With excitement brimming in his face, he said, \u201cLi Fan, contact him, I want to find him and ask him to personally guide me about the song. At my concert, I want to present the most perfect state of this song to my fans!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201dAfter Li Fan sent an email reply to Zhang Han, the 2 of them took a look at each other and smiled. At this time, they finally felt that their stomach was incomparably hungry and planned to go eat their lunch which had already become cold.Of course, those were all afterword.Meng Meng\u2019s Leisure Restaurant was just like its name, the atmosphere within the restaurant was very leisure, with Zhang Han accompanying Meng Meng to play.At noon 11.50am, Liang Mengqi, Yu Qingqing, and Zhao Dahu came to the restaurant.\u201cHahaha.\u201dZhao Dahu said as he twisted his body and laughed lightly, \u201cIt feels so great today, I straightforwardly threw the resignation letter on the director\u2019s face! This feels so great! Let him always order me around, humph! Boss, cook a bit more rice for lunch, I want to eat 2 portions! I wasn\u2019t able to react in the morning and the egg fried rice were all snatched finished by those 2 heartless fellows!\u201d\u201cI can only cook that much rice with that rice pot.\u201d Zhang Han laughed lightly and replied.Meng Meng\u2019s appetite was quite small. Not counting Meng Meng, there were 4 adults present in the restaurant. Speaking according to the quantity of rice in the morning, Zhang Han had a plate, Liang Mengqi and Yu Qingqing both had 2 plates, Zhao Dahu had 1 plate, and Meng Meng had half a plate, which was a total of 6 and a half plate. This amount of quantity of rice was enough to prove that the capacity of this house-use rice cooker was already counted as big.Furthermore, Zhang Han felt that it was quite good. He did not want to be like those professional restaurants which had to cook for a long very time once they were opened for business. The significance of the restaurant\u2019s existence was just a place to cook food for Meng Meng and stay at. When he cooks for Meng Meng, what he sold during that time were only incidental.As for selling food to earn money? Zhang Han had never thought of it. If he had thought it, it was reckoned that the restaurant\u2019s monthly earnings would be above a million.Returning back to the topic, after hearing that Zhang Han said that there was only that much amount of rice, Liang Mengqi\u2019s expression immediately became very vigilant as she said hurriedly, \u201cLet me tell you all, I eat 2 portions every time I\u2019m here. Furthermore, you guys were brought here by me, you all cannot be forget back and turn back on righteousness!\u201d(\u5fd8\u6069\u8d1f\u4e49: Forget favor and turn back on righteousness \u2013 Basically means being ungrateful)After Liang Mengqi finished speaking, Yu Qingqing turned around and smacked heavily onto Zhao Dahu\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cSissy Zhao, you can only eat 1 plate!\u201d\u201cWhy? People also want\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEn?\u201d Yu Qinqqing glared.\u201cAlright, alright, won\u2019t it do if I promise you? Seriously! But, 1 plate is not enough for me to eat. How about\u2026we split that 2 plates of fried rice into 3 portion?\u201d Zhao Dahu tried to ask.\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d2 stiff voices immediately replied to him. The resolute tone made Zhao Dahu to not doubt the slightest that if he was to continue dawdling, the 2 women in front of him would most likely turn into female tigers!Liang Mengqi was still okay a bit since she was a lady from a wealthy family. But Yu Qingqing didn\u2019t care about all those, she was the kind of ruthless character that would get angry if she said she was going to get angry!Yu Qingqing\u2019s taekwondo black belt was not fake at all.\u201cSigh\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhao Dahu drooped his head dispiritedly as he sat at the table beside the 2 women and silently shed tears in his heart.As for Liang Mengqi and Yu Qingqing, they started chatting together cheerfully. When Meng Meng came down from the 2nd floor to prepare to eat, the 2 women smiled and chatted with Meng Meng for a bit.The food was done. Zhang Han carried his and Meng Meng\u2019s lunch to the dining table. There was no need to talk about Liang Mengqi and Yu Qingqing, the 2 of them straightforwardly walked to the counter to get the food themselves.The 2 of them were more straightforward this time, as the both of them straightforwardly took 2 plates of egg fried rice. After proudly taking a look at Zhao Dahu who was scowling miserably, with a victorious expression, they walked back to the dining table to enjoy the delicious lunch.\u201cHow is he able to cook it this deliciously?\u201d While eating, Yu Qingqing shook her head and sigh, \u201cSigh, how will I be able to eat the rice of other restaurants in the future.\u201d\u201cSigh.\u201d Liang Mengqi sighed along with Yu Qingqing and said, \u201cI\u2019m finished, I\u2019m finished, for me to eat 2 plates of rice in one go, if my brother was to know this, he will definitely laugh at me. Also, if I continue eating like this, I\u2019m afraid that I am going to start growing weight in a few days.\u201d\u201cCough, cough, about that, I\u2019m not worried about gaining weight, I\u2019m currently still a bit skinny. How about you two\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhao Dahu\u2019s feeble voice came from behind.\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it!\u201d The 2 women rejected coldly at the same time.After rejecting Zhao Dahu, the 2 of them took a look at each other and laughed at the same time.After eating finish, Liang Mengqi patted onto her tummy in satisfaction. With a happy expression, she turned her head around, looked at Zhang Han who was tidying up the dining table with an admiring gaze and said with a joking tone, \u201cBoss, why is your rice that fragrant? Could it be that you added in some kind of poison?\u201d\u201cPoison\u2026\u2026\u201dZhang Han couldn\u2019t help but laugh and said, \u201cYour imagination is truly wide. Be at ease, there is definitely no poison. My ingredients are the best, therefore the rice could be that fragrant. Also, even If you ate 2 plates, you also wouldn\u2019t gain weight. As long as you are not like a pig, the kind of person to sleep after having a meal, you won\u2019t gain weight.\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d Liang Mengqi blinked her eyes and snorted, \u201cPeople is not a pig. People even do yoga every day!\u201d(The word \u2018people\u2019 is referring to Liang Mengqi herself.)\u201cOh, oh, oh.\u201d Yu Qingqing\u2019s eyes lighted up as she clicked her tongue and said in a small voice, \u201cTo speak in this kind of tone, could it be that you have fallen in love with him?\u201dHearing that, Liang Mengqi\u2019s face became red and rolled her eyes at Yu Qingqing petulantly. Then, she looked towards Zhang Han and said, \u201cBoss, why are you not playing the piano?\u201d\u201cBecause, because, only when Meng Meng wants to listen to the piano, then will daddy play the piano.\u201d After Meng Meng drank the last mouth of milk, she swayed her little arm and said.\u201cIt that so? Then, Meng Meng, do you want to listen to your daddy play the piano now?\u201d Liang Mengqi asked with a smile.\u201cEh\u2026I want to. Daddy, Meng Meng wants to listen to the piano.\u201d Meng Meng said with her cute voice.\u201cAlright, I will play the piano for Meng Meng.\u201dZhang Han placed the utensils that were washed into the cabinet, took off his rubber gloves and hang it on the bottom side of the cabinet, then walked over and carried Meng Meng who was stretching out her little palms and requesting for a hug.After Zhang Han placed Meng Meng at the small sofa which was at the side of the piano, he sat down in front of the piano, opened the piano cover and after thinking for a bit, he turned around and asked, \u201cWhat do you all want to listen to?\u201d\u201cCastle in the Sky!\u201d After muttering for a bit, Liang Mengqi replied while feeling somewhat of a small excitement in her heart.This was the first time that Zhang Han had a bit of the genuine appearance of a restaurant\u2019s boss. In Liang Mengqi\u2019s eyes, Zhang Han\u2019s action was really like that of a gentleman!\u201cEn.\u201dZhang Han nodded his head lightly and prepared to play Castle in the Sky.Castle in the Sky was the theme song of one of Japan\u2019s very old animation movie. The movie was screened at Japan during the year 1986. The movie tells the story of young orphan Sheeta\u2019s adventure of discovering the mystical floating city of Laputa along with a fellow orphan named Pazu who she met, while being pursued by both Muska and the pirates, who lust for the city\u2019s myriad treasures.The theme song original name was called \u2018Carrying You\u2019, and was later on generally known as \u2018Castle in the Sky\u2019. The theme song was composed by the music master, Joe Hisaishi. Because of its elegant tune which made others shed tears, and its beautiful tuning which touched the heartstrings of others, it became well-known in the entire world, and became the famous movie music which circulated down even to this day.\u201cHe really knows how to play the piano? I actually thought that Steinway Model O Grand Piano was but just a decoration.\u201d Yu Qingqing grinned and said in a small voice, as her gaze which looked towards Zhang Han also became very curious.For a restaurant\u2019s boss to know how to play the piano, it feels somewhat odd just thinking about it.Very quickly, Zhang Han began playing the piano.There was no whatsoever musical score at all because Zhang Han was incomparably familiar with all of the 88 piano keys of the piano. Zhang Han understood the tone of every piano key very deeply.When Zhang Han began playing, the melodious melody which was at the early part of Castle in the Sky rang out.However, when it was at the middle where there was quite a sad ambiance, Zhang Han\u2019s playing speed suddenly became fast, letting this somewhat sad music to be filled with a lively atmosphere. This pleasant melody was actually able to make others become infatuated when they listened to it.\u201cPfft\u2026\u2026\u201dZhao Dahu just finished slowly eating the plate of egg fried rice. After finishing, he lightly placed the spoon at one side very solemnly, showing his respect towards the egg fried rice. Then, he picked up the cup of cow milk and drank a mouth. When Zhao Dahu heard the melodious music, he turned his head around sub-consciously.Upon seeing Zhang Han\u2019s appearance while Zhang Han was playing the piano, Zhao Dahu spat out the cow milk that was in his mouth.\u201cCough, cough, cough. Nani? He\u2026really is a master pianist?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be noisy! Take a mop and mop clean the area that you just dirtied!\u201d Yu Qingqing wrinkled her brows and glared at Zhao Dahu fiercely.\u201cUnderstood.\u201dZhao Dahu replied in a small voice and walked towards the kitchen quietly and slowly. After carefully taking the mop, he went to back to mop the floor. While mopping the floor, he looked somewhat absentmindedly at Zhang Han who was playing the piano. In a moment, he actually also felt in his heart that Zhang Han was handsome, and even couldn\u2019t help but mumbled in a small voice,\u201cHow can he be that handsome? If I was a woman, I will definitely chase after him!\u201dCastle in the Sky ended quietly under the lively tempo.\u201cYou played it very well!\u201d Yu Qingqing praised loudly.\u201cHumph, humph, as I said, the boss is a master pianist, and he is even more formidable compared to Lang Zong.\u201d Liang Mengqi said somewhat proudly.\u201cIndeed.\u201d Zhao Dahu nodded his head and agreed, \u201cWhen I heard you said that, I didn\u2019t believe it at first. But right now, I also feel that the boss is better compared to Lang Zong. No! The boss is the most formidable master pianist that is alive in this world!\u201dZhao Dahu originally did not like Zhang Han very much, and it was mainly because of that incident at the beach. Just that, after coming to the restaurant today, this restaurant completely toppled Zhao Dahu\u2019s notion. The egg fried rice and milk had conquered his stomach, this melodious piano music had conquered his ears, and Zhang Han this person himself, was nearly at the point of conquering his soul!He did not understand just how could a person be this formidable?Liked it?

    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - uninvited guestPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euIt was peaceful within the restaurant, but little did they know, a group of unexpected guests would be coming to the restaurant soon!In front of the traffic light that was at the end of the street, a white color Toyota Land Cruiser was currently waiting for the traffic lights. Within the car, there was a total of 5 people. Other than the person who drove the car wore a white color short-sleeved shirt, the 4 other people all wore black color short-sleeved short, revealing the tattoo that was on their arm. Taking a look at those, it could be easily seen that those group of people were gangsters.The 4 people who wore black color short-sleeved shirts all had brightly colored hair, and only the person that was driving the car had a crew cut that was similar to Zhang Han\u2019s crew cut. The driver\u2019s jawline was sharp and clear, resembling somewhat like Eddie Pang Yu-yen, possessing quite a handsome look. Calmness was visible in his gaze and there was an aura of a person who was in a higher position in him.Furthermore, from the respectful attitude that the few other people showed towards him, it could be seen that this person who was driving the car had the highest position within the few people in the car!This person was Zhao Feng, who was known as \u2018madman\u2019 in the underworld.\u201cBrother Feng, there are only those few small restaurants left to deal with. After we get the management fee from them, we are done with our work.\u201d The rough looking male who was sitting in the front passenger seat said.\u201cEn.\u201d Zhao Feng nodded his head.\u201cSigh, this year\u2019s management fees are too simple to collect already, unlike in the previous years where there would still be some who didn\u2019t want to hand over the management fee. There would be some fun if there were still people like that. I like seeing the terrified look of those people when they yield and hand over the money, haha! I hope the next few restaurants would show a bit of resistant, if not, I\u2019m going to be bored to death from having no fights to fight for the past few days!\u201d A yellow hair youth curled his lips and said with a smile.\u201cXiao Huang, you only know how to fight, fight, and fight every day. It would be fine to act cool if you have Brother Zhao\u2019s skills, but you are thin like a fool, what do you even want fight for?\u201d Another person dissed ruthlessly.\u201cFuck! How many people could be that awesome like Brother Zhao? Even if I am no match for people like Brother Zhao, am I no match for some weaklings? Let me tell you all, if there is any restaurant boss that doesn\u2019t agree to hand over the management fee later on, don\u2019t try to snatch him away from me.\u201d The yellow hair youth said with an evil grin.\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201dAfter the red light passed, Zhao Feng drove the car forward. While driving the car, he wrinkled his brows slightly and said, \u201cCollect the management fees honestly, don\u2019t do any of those messy things. If you want to fight, go find someone from Tongluo Gulf\u2019s Xinyi Gang to fight!\u201d\u201cHehehe.\u201d The yellow hair youth grinned and laughed, then said in a small voice, \u201cWhere would I even have Brother Feng\u2019s capability? Back then when Brother Feng you went and broke the hand of one of Xinyi Gang\u2019s hall master\u2019s son, in the end, that hall master didn\u2019t even dare to find you to take revenge. If it was changed to me, I reckoned I would be crippled during the night of that day.\u201dZhao Feng took a look at him from the rearview mirror and did not say anything else.2 years ago, Zhao Feng came to Xiangjiang\u2019s south district and joined Yonghe Gang. Only using the time of 2 years, thanks to the help of his ruthless and resolute methods, Zhao Ping became the number 1 fighter of the gang\u2019s boss, Tang Zhan. There was no need to doubt Zhao Feng\u2019s strength.Yonghe Gang and Xinyi Gang were famous underground powers of Xiangjiang. The 2 gangs were enemies. Xinyi Gang was the underground big shot at the area around Longtuo Gulf, and Yonghe Gang was the underground big shot of south district.They were both underground powers, but Yonghe Society did things much more ruthlessly and decisively. Yonghe Society was proficient in sex deals, gambling, and drugs. Furthermore, they even had a branch for smuggling.Zhao Feng was actually a special forces soldier, but because of various reasons, back then, he committed negligent manslaughter and was imprisoned for 2 years. Later on, the government department found him and gave him a new identity, letting him regain his freedom.The price was that he had to join Yonghe Gang and search for the proof of the various crimes that Tang Zhan committed, then take over Tang Zhan\u2019s place and properly manage Yonghe Gang and keep sex deals, gambling, and drugs far away from the south district.During the 2 years, Zhao Feng had gathered some evidence, but all these evidence were not enough to sentence Tang Zhan. Thus, Zhao Feng took risks and hooked up with one of Tang Zhan\u2019s woman. Just when he was about to obtain important evidence, that woman suddenly disappeared, and he was sent by Tang Zhan to come to Crescent Gulf to handle the kind of things like \u2018collecting rent\u2019.Actually, he was quite disgusted with going to every shop to collect the management fee. In addition, this so-called management fee was just basically a nicer way of saying protection fee. Collecting protection fee was one of Yonghe Gang\u2019s source of income.\u201cWe have collected from this restaurant, we have also collected from this\u2026\u2026\u201d The blue color hair male who was sitting at the front passenger seat browsed through an account book. Suddenly, he pointed to the Chuanla Restaurant that was beside the street and said, \u201cThis is the place. We still have not collected from this Chuanla Restaurant and the 6 restaurants at the back.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get off the car.\u201d Zhao Feng straightforwardly stopped the car at the front of the Chuanla Restaurant, and the 5 of them got off the car in succession and walked into the restaurant.The female attendant who went to check out Zhang Han\u2019s restaurant walked up and welcomed the 5 people with a smile. When she saw the manner of the few people, her expression withdrew back and felt somewhat afraid in her heart.\u201cCall your boss to come out!\u201d The yellow hard youth said with a rude and unreasonable tone.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201d The female\u2019s expression was somewhat bitter as she said in a small voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, our boss is currently not here, only the manager is here.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking understand human words? If he is not here, call him to come here!\u201d The yellow hair youth glared.The fierce look made the female\u2019s body trembled.\u201cCall your manager over first.\u201d Zhao Feng waved his hand towards her and said.\u201cAlright, alright, please wait a moment.\u201d The female hurriedly turned around and ran.A few minutes later, the manager of the restaurant walked over in quick steps. The manager\u2019s face was full of smile as he said, \u201cGood afternoon to the few of you customers, I am the restaurant\u2019s manager, not sure what the few of you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t speak rubbish, give your boss a call and tell him that Yonghe Gang is here to collect the management fee!\u201d The yellow hair youth wrinkled his brows and said.\u201cAlright, alright, please wait a moment.\u201dThe manager\u2019s face changed, and there was some fear in the gaze that he looked towards the few people. Hurriedly walking over to the counter, he used the fixed phone to call his boss. When the call got through, he spoke while nodding his head at the same time. After speaking a few sentences, he hung the phone and immediately took out 2 and a half pile of money from the drawer.\u201cThere are 25k rmb here. My boss said that the extra money here is for treating the few of you to drink tea.\u201d The manager said with a face full of smile.\u201cHeh!\u201d The yellow hair male snatched over the money and said with some satisfaction in his gaze, \u201cCount you all as sensible.\u201dNormally, for a small restaurant like this, the protection fee that they would collect was 20k rmb per year. Sometimes when people like them who comes out to collect the management fee found a boss who seems good to bully, they would ask for more management fee and take the extra management fee for themselves.For this Chuanla Restaurant to give an additional 5k rmb management fee, in the eyes of the few people, the restaurant belonged to the kind that was sensible.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dZhao Feng did not have any expression. After he nodded his head with a slight smile towards the manager, he turned around and took the lead to leave.\u201cMeng Meng\u2019s Leisure Restaurant? What an interesting restaurant name.\u201d Upon seeing the restaurant\u2019s name, the yellow hair male sneered.\u201cAiyo, look at the notice board, in a day, they are only opened for business for a total of 3 hours? What the heck, egg fried rice for 280, milk for 80, fuck, isn\u2019t this restaurant evidently trying to cheat people?\u201d The blue hair male grinned and said, \u201cBrother Feng, since this restaurant\u2019s food is sold that expensive, shouldn\u2019t we also double the amount of money to collect from them?\u201d\u201cDouble what money? Every restaurant\u2019s management fee is 20k! Yonghe Society\u2019s income is not earned by depending on those protection fees!\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s brows twitched and said with a reprimanding tone, then took the lead to walk into the restaurant.Within the restaurant, Zhang Han\u2019s playing of Marriage D\u2019Amour was already at its end.Zhang Han saw the scene outside of the restaurant, and even the words that those few people said, Zhang Han also heard it clearly too. Revolving the spiritual strength within his body to the both of his ears would enable the listening capability of the ears to raise several times.However, Zhang Han did not stop playing the piano, and Liang Mengqi, Yu Qingqing, Zhao Dahu, and Meng Meng were also listening infatuatedly to the Marriage D\u2019Amour that Zhang Han was playing.\u201cWhere is the boss? Call the boss to come out!\u201dAfter entering into the restaurant, the yellow hair youth shouted just as he usually did.The shouting gave the few of them a shock. Liang Mengqi\u2019s brows wrinkled, a trace of fierceness flashed passed Yu Qingqing\u2019s eyes, and Zhao Dahu blocked in front of Yu Qingqing while feeling anxious.Zhang Han\u2019s fingers that were playing the piano came to a stop, and the piano sound dissipated. With an indifferent voice, he said, \u201cQuiet down.\u201dAfter finish speaking, Zhang Han continued playing the final small section of Marriage D\u2019Amour. While playing, he took a glance at Meng Meng who had a somewhat fearful expression and muttered in his heart for a bit.Should I reveal out my skills in front of Meng Meng this time?Zhang Han considered. Ever since he came into contact with cultivation, he had practically never fought and also didn\u2019t go around killing here and there. Searching for treasures to enrich one\u2019s life was the true essence. But right now, in the front of Meng Meng, Zhang Han did not mind revealing out a valiant side of his.After finishing playing the piano, Zhang Han stood up.\u201cWho is the boss? Huh? Can\u2019t you guys hear what I say?\u201d The yellow hair youth shouted with an arrogant expression.\u201cDaddy, daddy, I\u2019m scared\u2026\u2026\u201d Meng Meng said in a small voice. Looking at her expression, it was reckoned that if the yellow hair youth was to shout a few more times, she would start crying from being scared.\u201cMeng Meng don\u2019t be scared!\u201dLiang Mengqi couldn\u2019t stand looking at it anymore and walked with large steps to the front of Meng Meng and blocked Meng Meng behind her, then looked towards the yellow hair youth and said with an angry expression, \u201cWhat are you shouting for! Don\u2019t you have any bit of manners?\u201dThis scene caused the yellow hair youth and the few others to go into a daze slightly.\u201cAiyo, don\u2019t say, this woman looks quite pretty, and her goods are also not small, I reckoned that her goods would feel good to touch.\u201d The blue hair male said with a lowly smiling face.Apart from Zhao Feng who was frowning slightly, the few others all started laughing.Actually, Zhao Feng extremely dislikes the personality of the few people. But he couldn\u2019t do anything about it, his identity right now was that he was one of them. If he was to act upright, and the news of that was to spread to Tang Zhang\u2019s ears, it would inevitably give rise to suspicions. Therefore, during those 2 years, even when he came across his subordinates bullying other people, he would basically not go and care about it. He had to suppress the kindness in his heart and do his \u2018job\u2019 to the best that he could!But right now, seeing that the adorable Meng Meng was about to be scared to the point of crying, and seeing that the gorgeous female in front of him was being sexually harassed, Zhao Feng was already somewhat at the point where could no longer suppress the fire in his heart and was even intending to find a chance to properly give those few subordinates a teaching when he goes back.This block of Liang Mengqi made Zhang Han to somewhat look at her in her different light and felt a trace of good impression towards her raised in his heart.However, the little princess was more important, thus Zhang Han carried Meng Meng in the first moment and said gently,\u201cMeng Meng, don\u2019t be afraid, daddy is here.\u201d\u201cDaddy, they, they are so scary.\u201d Within her daddy\u2019s embrace, Meng Meng felt much more at ease. However, her voice was still very small.\u201cThey are not scary, they are only pretending. Didn\u2019t daddy tell you before? What are they? 1 word.\u201d Zhang Han said with a light smile.\u201cEh\u2026\u2026Ants?\u201d Meng Meng replied after pondering for a bit.Liked it?

    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - pressuringPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu[For Alliance Head Snoopy, Gadget]\u201cRight, they are ants.\u201d Zhang Han laughed, and extended his hand to scrape Mengmeng\u2019s face.\u201cHaha \u2026\u201d \u201cAn ant.\u201d Receiving Zhang Han\u2019s praise, Mengmeng looked at Zhang Han\u2019s smiling face, and all the fear in his heart disappeared, as he chuckled.This scene not only made the yellow-hair and the others\u2019 expressions change, even Liang Mengqi was stunned.She could not understand why Zhang Han\u2019s heart was so heavy, the people in front of her were clearly hoodlums, what if they started fighting and got injured? What if he couldn\u2019t make a meal? What if he couldn\u2019t coax the child? What if I can\u2019t play the piano? Did he ever think about the consequences?Liang Mengqi felt angry and amused at the same time.As for Zhang Han, he turned his head and looked at Zhao Feng and the others. His expression was indifferent, and his tone of voice was still as gentle as before:\u201cYou little ant, I can strangle you with my fingers. Does Mengmeng want to see how Father will beat up those bad guys?\u201d\u201cBrat, what did you say?\u201d The yellow-hair\u2019s expression turned vicious, and he stretched his hand towards the back of his waist, where his dagger was.This action caused the atmosphere to turn cold, while Yu Qingqing\u2019s body tensed up, as if he was planning to attack as well.Seeing that, Mengmeng became a little afraid, and anxiously said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to see, I don\u2019t want to see, Mengmeng doesn\u2019t want to see PaPa fight\u2026\u201dMengmeng knew that she would be injured if she fought, she did not want to see where PaPa was injured.\u201cFine, fine, fine. I don\u2019t want to fight. I don\u2019t want to fight, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Zhang Han hurriedly turned his head and coaxed her with a few words, then handed Mengmeng over to the Liang Mengqi beside him and said: \u201cHelp me hug him.\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Liang Mengqi took Mengmeng and turned around, not allowing Mengmeng to see those bad guys.Zhang Han walked to the computer counter, opened the drawer and took out three stacks of bills.After that, he walked towards Zhao Feng and the others. His gaze became extremely indifferent, and his eyes revealed a sense of disdain, as though he was an emperor looking at his own citizens.Although Zhang Han\u2019s footsteps were slow, it gave the people in front of him quite a bit of pressure!Even Zhao Feng\u2019s expression changed slightly.\u2018It\u2019s an expert! \u2018Zhao Feng\u2019s pupils contracted slightly.\u201cIf you want to collect fees, do it honestly.\u201d Zhang Han placed the money in the yellow-haired youth\u2019s hands, laughed lightly, and said: \u201cIt\u2019s not that you have a loud voice, but you\u2019re very powerful. If you dare to step in here in the future, your life, doesn\u2019t need to exist.\u201dZhang Han\u2019s words were plain, but they gave these few people a pressure as heavy as Mt. Tai. Other than Zhao Feng, the others even felt that this pressure was stronger than what Tang Zhan had come from.This was a society governed by the law, but they did not doubt Zhang Han\u2019s words at all. They felt the same way in their hearts, that if yellow hair came to the restaurant next time, he might really lose his life!Who is he? Why \u2026 How could he emit such a great pressure?Especially the yellow-haired youth, he felt the greatest pressure. At this moment, he actually wanted to open his mouth and say, \u201cI understand.\u201dEspecially in front of Zhao Feng, if he behaved like a coward, it would be even more shameful. He even felt that if he performed well and was looked upon by Zhao Feng, then he would definitely be able to rise to the top of the society.Therefore, the youth endured the monstrous pressure. With a flushed face, he gritted his teeth and said, \u201cYou \u2026\u201dJust as the words left his mouth, suddenly.\u201cBam!\u201dWith a dull thud, the yellow-haired youth\u2019s face turned from red to white.Drops of cold sweat trickled down his forehead.On his chest, a huge fist was lying there.The fist, was not Zhang Han\u2019s, but Zhao Feng\u2019s fist.Zhao Feng used 50% of his strength to punch his opponent, causing the yellow hair to immediately feel unbearable pain, it was so painful that he couldn\u2019t even speak.From that muffled sound, it was clear that this punch was not light.Zhao Feng didn\u2019t even spare yellow hair a glance as he stared at Zhang Han and said apologetically: \u201cSir, I am truly sorry that I didn\u2019t properly discipline my subordinates and scared your daughter. It was my fault.\u201d\u201cAlright, you can leave after you\u2019ve collected the money.\u201dZhang Han gave him a bland look, from his body, Zhang Han could faintly feel the bloodlust of a soldier. After he finished speaking, Zhang Han turned around and walked to Liang Mengqi\u2019s side and carried Mengmeng, then sat down at the dining table and coaxed him.\u201cUn \u2026\u201dZhao Feng muttered to himself, then took out a name card from his pocket and placed it on the table. He smiled, then said: \u201cSir, we are not randomly collecting fees, there are some local thugs here, if they are causing trouble here, then you can give me a call. Here is my business card, your restaurant is very interesting, if there is a chance, I will take care of the business, goodbye.\u201dAfter Zhao Feng finished speaking, he took the lead and walked out, his words were also true, at the same time collecting protection fees, they would also be in charge of the restaurant\u2019s safety, if someone caused trouble, then their people would be able to arrive at the place in less than five minutes to resolve the problem, but under normal circumstances they would leave behind the company\u2019s special number, but this time, Zhao Feng had left behind his private number.Because he felt that the Zhang Han in front of him was very extraordinary, to the point that he could even use the word \u2018terrifying\u2019 to describe him!In his heart, he even felt that if he were to fight with the owner of this restaurant, he would definitely be the one to lose!But\u2026 He was one of the top three in the special forces back then!As for him \u2026 Was it really just the owner of a restaurant?Zhao Feng was a little absent-minded as he walked out the door.\u201cBrother Feng, why did you hit me just now?\u201d The yellow-hair\u2019s face turned slightly pale as he said innocently.\u201cBam!\u201dThis time, Zhao Feng did not hold back at all and kicked the yellow hair five meters away, falling onto the ground while covering his stomach with cold sweat.\u201cWe are here to collect rent, not to cause trouble. If you dare do this again, I will break your leg and throw you out of Hong Kong!\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s face was gloomy, his tone extremely cold.His words scared the others into silence!In the underworld, no one had ever doubted the words of a madman. The origin of his nickname was made from blood, and he never broke his word.\u201cI, I know \u2026\u201d The yellow hair man grinned in pain and replied with difficulty. He knew that if he did not respond, with Zhao Feng\u2019s personality, he would probably attack again.\u201cNext one!\u201d Zhao Feng said coldly and led the way to the next restaurant.The yellow-hair was helped up by his two companions and followed quietly behind them. After this incident, the other restaurants would probably receive quite a bit of polite treatment.Inside Zhang Han\u2019s dining room.\u201cMengmeng, didn\u2019t I already tell you? They are just ants, we don\u2019t need to be afraid.\u201d Zhang Han said to Mengmeng with a smile.\u201cBut, but they look too scary \u2026\u201d Mengmeng said weakly.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Mengmeng is a cute, soft girl, how can she not be afraid of those ugly people.\u201d Liang Mengqi said with a light smile.\u201cYou\u2019re pretty brave.\u201d Zhang Han looked at Liang Mengqi, and shook his head with a smile.\u201cHumph!\u201d I\u2019m not afraid of those hooligans. Boss, let me tell you, it\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re here today. Do you know what Qing Qing does? \u201cLet me tell you, Qingqing is a black belt Taekwondo expert!\u201d Liang Mengqi shook his head and said with slight complacency.\u201cOh? Is that so? \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Zhang Han looked at Yu Qingqing strangely.\u201cOf course, my family\u2019s Qingqing is very powerful.\u201d Zhao Dahu said as he shook his head.\u201cNope.\u201d Yu Qingqing walked over and looked at Zhang Han in surprise. \u201cBoss, just a few words and you scared those people away, I can\u2019t compare to you.\u201dThe pressure just now was not only felt by Zhao Feng and the rest, but also by Yu Qingqing and the others.On the other hand, Liang Mengqi and Zhao Dahu did not feel anything, they only felt that Zhang Han had an imposing manner, and the better the skills he had, the deeper the feeling, as if the two society\u2019s people could see after looking at each other for a while and could tell whether he was truly fierce or was trying to show off.\u201cMy, my PaPa is the strongest.\u201d Every time others praised Zhang Han, he would feel as if they were praising himself. The pride in his heart was all displayed on his face, and the key thing was that Zhang Han still enjoyed it a lot.Which father didn\u2019t want to be high and mighty in the eyes of their children!\u201cCough, cough.\u201dSeeing that Zhang Han was smiling so sweetly and feeling so good, Liang Mengqi felt that a chance had come. He coughed lightly and said, \u201cErm \u2026 Boss, can I ask you a favor? \u201d\u201cYes, go ahead.\u201dOf course, in Zhang Han\u2019s eyes, there was a difference of \u2018respect for one foot\u2019. Just by speaking with respect, it was useless, but the way Liang Mengqi blocked in front of Mengmeng just now, Zhang Han could be considered a true \u2018respect\u2019.Therefore, facing her request, Zhang Han would consider.\u201cBoss, can you cook more rice at once? See, Mistress Zhao isn\u2019t even full yet.\u201d Liang Mengqi glanced at Zhao Dahu and said.Zhao Dahu was startled, then overjoyed, and agreed with a fawning expression: \u201cYes, that\u2019s right, Big Brother Boss, I really can\u2019t fill my stomach.\u201d\u201cYou deserve it if you don\u2019t have enough to eat!\u201d Hearing Zhao Dahu\u2019s lowly expression and tone, goosebumps rose all over Yu Qingqing\u2019s body as he said, \u201cScram! \u201cDon\u2019t be so disgusting!\u201d\u201cBut I really can\u2019t fill my stomach \u2026\u201d Zhao Dahu said pitifully.\u201cThe rice pot here is not big. Every time I cook, I make the most of it.\u201d Zhang Han said as he shook his head slightly.Hearing that, Liang Mengqi\u2019s expression paused, and asked hesitantly: \u201cThen, why don\u2019t we change it to a different steamer?\u201dZhao Dahu\u2019s eyes lit up, and he anxiously said: \u201cThat\u2019s right, why not change the pot? I\u2019ll pay for the wok, oh no, I\u2019ll buy the wok! \u201dLooking at their expressions, Mengmeng felt that it was interesting. She raised her little palm and cheered: \u201cChange the pot, change the pot\u2026\u201dUnder everyone\u2019s gazes, Zhang Han smiled and nodded: \u201cOk.\u201d\u201cYay!\u201d Zhao Dahu jumped in joy, he said passionately: \u201cBoss, go take a rest, I\u2019ll clean up this place.\u201d\u201cMm, as long as it isn\u2019t a mess.\u201d Zhang Han did not care what they did, he only warned them and then carried Mengmeng upstairs.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t be a mess even if you specify a tiny bit of it!\u201d Zhao Dahu gave the order with a serious face.Liked it?

Mengqi, I love you so much! \u201d Zhao Dahu gave Liang Mengqi a big thumbs up.\u201cLook at you, you slut! You said to clean up, hurry up and clean up the dining table!\u201d Liang Mengqi rolled his eyes and said.\u201cUnderstood!\u201d Zhao Dahu saluted and went to clean up the table complacently.If this had happened in the past, he would never have imagined that one day he would have to clean up after eating in the dining hall. However, the key point was that he was actually so happy and excited!\u201cWhat a little slut.\u201d Yu Qingqing glanced at Zhao Dahu and scolded him with a smile.Qing Qing, let\u2019s go take a look at the boss\u2019s kitchen. He told me that in the future, not only are there Egg Fried Rice, there will be more delicious food. When we go shopping in a while, we can\u2019t just buy electric cookers. Liang Mengqi said as he pulled Yu Qingqing towards the kitchen.\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Let\u2019s go take a look.\u201dYu Qingqing and Liang Mengqi went into the kitchen to take a look.\u201cThe frying pan is a bit small.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s small, and one is not enough. Aren\u2019t there two stoves? Let\u2019s throw this wok away and buy two big ones. \u201d\u201cAnd electric cookers.\u201d\u201cYes, the most important thing is the electric cooker.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s also a steamer. How much food can be steamed in such a small amount?\u201d \u201cNo, I have to change it.\u201d\u201cChange the oven too.\u201d\u201cAre we going to buy some special tableware as well? Every time we use paper cups, paper plates and disposable chopsticks, spoons, we feel awkward. \u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. Buy one set each time. At worst, we can just clean up our own dishes in the future!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe two stayed in the kitchen for a while, until Zhao Dahu finished tidying up the table and threw the trash out. After that, he walked to the kitchen and looked at the kitchen utensils on the counter.\u201cThrow it away!\u201dThe two ladies spoke without turning their heads.Zhao Dahu immediately reacted and joined the battle.The three of them took these brand-new electric cookers, ovens and other utensils and \u2026 He threw it outside by the trash can.It looked like the staff who were cleaning up the trash would be able to reap some rewards today.\u2026\u2026At the same time, at Xue Qian\u2019s house.\u201cAiya, why hasn\u2019t there been a reply yet?\u201dLi Fan\u2019s notebook showed his mailbox. He pressed his left finger on the F5 refresh button and refreshed it every ten seconds, waiting for Han Yang\u2019s reply.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s normal not to be here during the day. We\u2019ll check the news later.\u201d Xue Qian was lying on the sofa and reading the lyrics. Seeing Li Fan\u2019s appearance, he shook his head.This guy, he was so excited when he saw a good song. He refreshed his mailbox for two hours in front of his computer, expecting Han Yang to answer.\u201cNow that you have something to do, you can study the song. As for me, I\u2019m in a hurry to finish discussing this song!\u201d Li Fan wanted to cry, but no tears came out.However, this was bound to be a useless action, because Zhang Han did not have the habit of using Penguin Software everyday. In fact, he had not done it even once a few years ago.\u2026\u2026Two hours later, Zhang Han walked down in an orderly fashion while carrying Mengmeng.When Zhang Han saw that all of the kitchens had been changed to large cooking utensils, he could not help but pause for a moment.\u201cYou guys \u2026 really bought a lot?\u201d Zhang Han said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.\u201cOf course, Boss. Since you\u2019ve given me the chance, of course we should cherish it, hehe.\u201d Liang Mengqi laughed and said: \u201cBoss, I saw that there is a space on the left side of the tableware cabinet, so we placed all three of us inside. The tableware is covered with names, we will use the normal tableware, and then we will go back and wash the dishes ourselves.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han nodded slightly.\u201cMengmeng, Mengmeng also needs to wash the dishes himself.\u201d Mengmeng said with her childish voice.\u201cMengmeng is the Little Princess.\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s expression turned serious, and said: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this kind of thing any time; you just have to properly enjoy life with daddy.\u201d\u201cUgh \u2026\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d Mengmeng cutely nodded her head.\u201cEh? \u201cBoss, where are you going?\u201d Liang Mengqi asked curiously when he saw Zhang Han walking out.\u201cGo out and come back in two or three hours.\u201d Zhang Han said as he looked at them.Liang Mengqi was using his phone to watch TV while Yu Qingqing and Zhao Dahu were playing games in the dark. From the looks of it, they were planning to spend the afternoon in the dining hall.\u201cBring me?\u201d I don\u2019t want to be a light bulb here either. \u201d Liang Mengqi\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cPfft, what electric light bulb?\u201d Yu Qingqing stared blankly at her, and said sinisterly: \u201cI think that some talents have impure goals and want to follow along.\u201d\u201cMy bad friend!\u201d Liang Mengqi let out a light snort, and did not turn back as he looked at Zhang Han with some anticipation.\u201cThen come.\u201d Zhang Han nodded and walked out.He planned to go to the Mount New Moon to harvest some wheat. After all, he couldn\u2019t possibly give Mengmeng rice every day.Furthermore, the vegetables that he had grown should be ripe by now. Zhang Han planned to make two regular dishes for Mengmeng to eat tonight.\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Liang Mengqi and Mengmeng sat in the back seat, and when the car started, Liang Mengqi could not help but ask.\u201cMount New Moon.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cOh.\u201d Liang Mengqi nodded.She did not continue asking, but Mengmeng could not help but flaunt his skills:\u201cLittle, little big sister, Mount New Moon is\u2026 The PaPa gave Mengmeng a paradise. \u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Liang Mengqi smiled, the dimples on her face made her smile look very sweet, and she laughed: \u201cThen Mount New Moon must be very beautiful?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to look at, but it\u2019s really pretty. Mount New Moon has it\u2026 There were many dogs, a large tree, many small houses, water, flowers, grass, cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, and \u2026 PaPa, what else is there? \u201d Mengmeng thought about the area where they grew rice. He wanted to express but he didn\u2019t know what to say, so he could only seek help from the PaPa.\u201cAnd ponds, and crops and vegetables.\u201d Zhang Han added with a smile.\u201cWow, according to Mengmeng, that place is truly a paradise.\u201d Liang Mengqi felt that this was great!Yes, her heart had already used the word \u2018greatness\u2019 to describe it. With so many things, just thinking about it would be quite troublesome.\u201cBut she\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Mengmeng said with a proud and childish voice.However, if they couldn\u2019t see it with their own eyes, they would definitely not know the beauty of the Mount New Moon.When Liang Mengqi reached the Mount New Moon.\u201cThis \u2026\u201dLiang Mengqi was stunned.\u201cThis\u2026 This is truly a paradise! \u201d\u201cBoss, how did you build this place?\u201d Isn\u2019t it too beautiful? \u201d\u201cIt feels like even the air is fragrant. This is unbelievable.\u201d\u201cOh my god, this\u2026\u201d A rose? \u201cThis \u2026\u201dZhang Han had already anticipated Liang Mengqi\u2019s performance, so as she walked towards the back of the mountain, she kept chattering and sighing.As for the Little Princess who was in Zhang Han\u2019s embrace, her expression revealed pride and pride.The Mount New Moon was specially made for Mengmeng.\u201cSo many dogs?\u201d When Liang Mengqi saw the dozens of dogs playing in the grass, his eyes turned green.Many people liked furry pets like cats and dogs, but there weren\u2019t many that were raised. After all, pets would lose their fur, and going to the toilet in the house was very troublesome.Although he could clean up, the house would have a bad smell after a long time. This situation could only be improved when the dog was older. They knew that they couldn\u2019t use the toilet in the house before going to look for their owner.If all the pets were like the ones that Zhang Han had, without any germs or odors, and still hadn\u2019t shed hair, then the number of pets would probably skyrocket.When Lil \u2018Black saw that Zhang had arrived, it ran over aggressively. When Lil\u2019 Black saw that there was an outsider present, it subconsciously wanted to act cool.\u201cOw\u2026\u201d \u201cHum?\u201dJust as it was about to call out, it saw that it was a girl, Xiao Hei unexpectedly spoke out in confusion, its eyes staring straight at Zhang Han and Liang Mengqi, not knowing what was going on.Could it be that the beauty from before wasn\u2019t the mistress?Why did another beauty come in a few days? It was so chaotic.\u201cIs this an iron-clad golden dog? \u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d Liang Mengqi exclaimed.\u201cNo, no, no. It\u2019s called Little Black. It\u2019s the Ironbag Golden Emperor Dog.\u201d Mengmeng corrected himself.\u201cOh, hello, Little Black.\u201d Liang Mengqi smiled and greeted her.\u201cAwoo, awoo \u2026\u201d Blacky responded in a gentle manner.\u201cYou guys stay here for a while, I\u2019m going to work.\u201d Zhang Han said as he walked towards wheat with the sickle in hand.Liang Mengqi had initially looked at Mengmeng and Little Black playing, but when she saw Little Black\u2019s fangs, she felt a little fearful and apprehensive. She did not expect that Little Black would actually be so obedient when facing Mengmeng.However, Liang Mengqi was still a little confused when he saw that Little Black\u2019s fur would often stick close to his face.After playing for an hour, Zhang Han finished harvesting half of the wheat field and stopped to trap the wheat in bundles.At this time, Liang Mengqi walked over and asked curiously:\u201cBoss, Mengmeng is a little too close to the dog. She\u2019s still young, so her immunity is not high, she shouldn\u2019t \u2026\u201dBefore Liang Mengqi could finish speaking, Zhang Han shook his head and interrupted him: \u201cIt\u2019s alright, the pets here don\u2019t have those germs.\u201d\u201cEh \u2026\u201d Liang Mengqi\u2019s expression froze. Although she could not believe it in her heart, she did not say anything else. Her gaze carefully sized up the surrounding crops, and said with a face full of praise:\u201cYou really planted so many things, Mengmeng is so happy.\u201d\u201cYou grow it yourself, only then will you be able to eat well.\u201d Zhang Han got a piece of wheat as he spoke and walked to the vegetable area. He picked some beans, dug up a few potatoes, and picked two tomatoes and a few eggplants.\u201cWow, do we have other delicacies for dinner?\u201d Liang Mengqi couldn\u2019t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva when he saw Zhang Han\u2019s actions and the sound of Egg Fried Rice.\u201cIt\u2019s Mengmeng and I.\u201d Zhang Han replied indifferently.\u201cHuh?\u201d Liang Mengqi was startled at first, but after that he grinded his teeth in anger and snorted loudly.Arriving at the foot of the mountain, Liang Mengqi and Mengmeng waited in the car. Zhang Han walked back and forth a few times before he finally took down the wheat.\u201cMengmeng, I really envy you for having such an outstanding father.\u201dBefore entering the room, Liang Mengqi could not help but sigh once more.Liked it?

Mengqi, say, did you seduce our boss?\u201d Yu Qingqing said as his mouth twitched.\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense, do you think everyone is as dirty as you? The boss is an upright person, hmph. \u201d Liang Mengqi let out a light snort, driving away Zhao Dahu who was sitting opposite to him, and sat on the chair himself.\u201cHmph, bullying.\u201d Zhao Dahu also snorted lightly.\u201cQingqing, let me tell you, the boss made a mountain. It\u2019s so beautiful there, there\u2019s \u2026\u201dAfter he sat down, Liang Mengqi excitedly chatted with Yu Qingqing about everything he had seen and heard in the Mount New Moon today.Zhang Han ignored their teasing and carried Mengmeng to the sofa instead.\u201cMengmeng, watch the TV for a while. Daddy is going to start cooking.\u201d Zhang Han looked at the time. It was already half past five, and it would take about an hour to cook a few dishes.\u201cOkay, Mengmeng wants to see a cartoon.\u201d Mengmeng replied with her childish voice.Zhang Han used the remote control to turn on the television, called out the children\u2019s channel, and then walked into the kitchen with the bag in his hand.First, he placed the two large bags of flour into the storage cabinet. When he turned around and saw the exceptionally large electric cooker, oven and other completely new products on the storage cabinet, the corner of Zhang Han\u2019s mouth slightly twitched a few times.\u2018Looks like I\u2019ve underestimated the word \u2018gluttonous\u2019 after all.\u2019Zhang Han found it funny, these kitchen utensils were not cheap, Zhang Han also did not think that the three foodies would change into large capacity kitchen utensils so quickly.The capacity of electric cooker is 18 liter, how much is 18 liter?You may not know this, but an electric cooker with 18 L of rice can cook 28 cups of rice, a rice cooker with its own rice measuring cup, a flat cup of rice waiting for rain, 3 or 2 meters, 3 or almost 3 bowls of rice. According to the calculation of 2 or 2 meters per person, it can cook the rice for 42 people, the calculation of 3 or 2 meters per person can cook the rice for 28 people, and the calculation of half a kilogram per person can satisfy 17 people.You can see how big the rice cooker is from here.Zhang Han slightly shook his head, washed the rice, and started to boil it in seven cups.He first laid the eggs aside, then began to gather the beans, potatoes, eggplant and tomatoes.After finishing his preparations, Zhang Han picked up the manuals for each product and quickly flipped through them.The prices of the kitchen utensils were not low. From this, it could be seen that the three people had some assets.Needless to say, Liang Mengqi already knew from her conversation with her brother that she was a disciple of a genuine big family, and also the most expensive out of the three.Yu Qingqing was second, she was the genuine Black Belt Taekwondo, and worked at Taekwondo. Her weekly working hours were only on Saturday and Sunday for two days, and her monthly salary was more than 200,000.Zhao Dahu was slightly weaker than the other three. He was the Deputy Director of a media company, and his annual salary was around 1.3 million.They did not lack money, but that did not mean that they would spend it randomly. They usually did not eat and play extravagantly, and Yu Qingqing\u2019s car at the door was a Matteng which was worth more than 200,000.At this moment, in front of the restaurant, the Land Cruiser that arrived at noon slowly stopped in front of the parking space.\u201cBam!\u201dZhao Feng got off the car, closed the door, and threw away the cigarette in his hand. He then looked at the signboard in front of the restaurant with a deep gaze, and walked inside.When it was time for dinner, Zhao Feng drove out of the company alone, and prepared to find a restaurant to eat. While driving, he thought about something, and unknowingly, he arrived at Zhang Han\u2019s restaurant.Zhao Feng was startled by the side of the road, but since he was already here, he decided to take care of it.He knew that he came here because Zhang Han gave him a lot of pressure at noon. He felt that Zhang Han was not an ordinary person, and besides being curious, he also wanted to taste what the two hundred and eighty yuan of Egg-Fried Rice looked like.When he walked into the dining room.Liang Mengqi, who was in the middle of chatting, stopped talking.\u201cWhat are you doing here again? \u201cLet me tell you, this is a legal society, and the friend in front of me is an expert of the black belt of Taekwondo. If you come here to cause trouble, my friend will help!\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dZhao Feng was slightly stunned, then looked at Liang Mengqi with a funny-looking look. This girl with a sense of justice and courage had given him a good impression, so Zhao Feng smiled slightly, shook his head and said: \u201cI\u2019m here to eat, not to cause trouble.\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d Then let me warn you, you have to be honest here, or else I\u2019ll show you! \u201d Liang Mengqi snorted lightly and sat back down.Zhao Feng laughed and walked in, and then sat down in the most innermost chair, and quietly waited there, only that his eyes would occasionally size up Zhang Han.Zhang Han was boiling the milk, looking like a normal restaurant owner.However, Zhao Feng was very clear that the owner of the restaurant would probably take him down in less than a minute. The pressure that he felt from the owner\u2019s body was even more intense than his own party leader previously!Back then, he was able to hold on for nearly two minutes in the captain\u2019s palm!However, what he did not know was that if Zhang Han wanted to take him down, a single move would be enough.Although Zhang Han saw the Qi Refining Stage as trash, but don\u2019t forget that he saw it as the perspective of a tribulation expert. In other words, if the Qi Refining Stage was placed in a martial forest, it would count as an inner strength expert!What was the level of inner strength? The Obvious Strenth, hidden strength, would only produce inner strength later on, which was also spirit energy. But Zhao Feng, right now, couldn\u2019t even be considered as a Obvious Strenth.As Zhao Feng stared at himself, he realized something as well. It was just that he never cared about the look of an \u2018ant\u2019.If Zhang Han still had the personality of a young master in the past, he would probably fight in all four directions to become a true monarch that ruled the world if he gained the ability to cultivate.But after experiencing such hardships, with the return of his past life and the presence of Mengmeng, Zhang Han had become even more casual.After he had raised his strength, he would settle the matter of his parents\u2019 disappearance, share his family\u2019s joy, and bring them to the Mount New Moon. He would also have a bland and happy life.After the milk was boiled, Zhang Han placed the pot on the counter. Immediately, a rich aroma wafted into the room.Although Liang Mengqi and the other two had drank before, they still took a whiff in an intoxicated manner.And Zhao Feng, who had never experienced such a scent before, was actually somewhat surprised.\u201cThis taste\u2026\u201d \u201cIt seems pretty good.\u201dZhao Feng muttered to himself.\u201cPaPa, PaPa, Mengmeng is hungry.\u201d After smelling the fragrance, Mengmeng also felt hungry. She turned around and said to Zhang Han: \u201cMengmeng wants to drink a cup of milk.\u201d\u201cNot now, the milk is very hot. There\u2019s only half an hour left to eat. Let\u2019s wait for a little while longer.\u201d Zhang Han chuckled.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d \u201cFine, fine.\u201d Mengmeng pouted and replied. He no longer watched TV and stepped on the sofa barefooted with his arms on the back. He raised his head and looked at the busy Zhang Han.On Zhang Han\u2019s side, it was obvious that he was speeding up.He took the onion with his left hand and drew a Chinese kitchen knife from the knife holder with his right.Originally, Zhang Han only had a few household knives, but after going through Liang Mengqi and the others\u2019 shopping, he had truly gotten a complete set of kitchen utensils, such as deboning knives, fish knife, beef knife, skin knife and so on. He had a total of more than 20 tools, and he even had all sorts of tools to cook dishes.But Zhang Han did not know much about the uses of the kitchen knives, so he could only use Chinese style kitchen knives.The Chinese kitchen knife is made of high carbon steel, with a sharp blade and wooden handle. It can cut, cut, cut and chop all kinds of ingredients. Western chefs use it to do heavy chopping work, but skilled Chinese chefs can use it to do almost all the work.\u201cBang, bang, bang \u2026\u201dA burst of hurried muffled sound came out, other than Zhao Feng who was staring straight at him, Liang Mengqi and the other two also turned their heads to look, only to see a flash of blade light, giving off a dreamy feeling.In two seconds, a whole blade of green onion had been neatly sliced into two. The speed at which it was cut was hard to imagine.After cutting the green onions, Zhang Han turned the kitchen knife in his hand and placed it back on the knife holder. He then casually took out a skinning knife that Zhang Han recognized.This action stunned Mengmeng\u2019s eyes.She said with incomparable adoration: \u201cWow, PaPa, so powerful!\u201dThis sentence was precisely the only thought in the hearts of Zhao Feng, Liang Mengqi, Yu Qingqing and Zhao Dahu.\u201cSo handsome \u2026\u201d The two women thought to themselves.\u201cSo cool, I should have practiced it.\u201d Zhao Dahu looked at her enviously.\u201cHe\u2026 It\u2019s a blade wielding expert! \u201dOnly Zhao Feng\u2019s gaze was deeper, the way he saw it was different from the others, he could see an expert\u2019s Qi from Zhang Han\u2019s blade, not to mention anything else, if he used this blade technique on the opponent, he would feel that he would not be able to last half a minute under Zhang Han\u2019s hand!As for Zhang Han, when he heard the little princess\u2019 praise, he did not answer nor turn his head. Instead, the corners of his mouth rose to form a smile.His left hand was holding a potato while his right hand was using a paring knife to rapidly move back and forth. Little by little, the potato skin was being removed.In just a few breaths of time, Zhang Han had completely removed the potato skin, and quickly tidied up the beans, eggplants, and tomatoes.He took out a frying pan and put the oil in it. Then, he boiled the beans for a while and put the potatoes in it again. After a while, he added in the smoked, octagon, 13 incense sticks, and a little white sugar.By brewing the fire into a small flame, about twenty minutes worth of salt, onion, garlic, and fragrant wood would be ready for cooking.Zhang Han\u2019s set. His movements were fluid and smooth, giving off a very comfortable feeling. It was a type of visual enjoyment.After doing all this, Zhang Han wiped his hands, took off his apron and hung it on the side of the kitchen, then walked over to Mengmeng\u2019s side and sat down.\u201cPaPa, you\u2019re so powerful.\u201dZhang Han sat, while Mengmeng stood, just enough to reach Zhang Han\u2019s face. The little princess hugged Zhang Han\u2019s neck and brought her cherry lips over.\u201cWhat?\u201dAfter kissing a few times, Zhang Han laughed heartily and started to play with Mengmeng.\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Liang Mengqi muttered with a slightly envious tone.\u201cMengmeng is so happy.\u201d Yu Qingqing muttered.\u201cHow warm it is. I also want a daughter now. Qingqing, why don\u2019t we \u2026\u201d Zhao Dahu had not finished speaking.\u201cScram!\u201dLiked it?

    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - eyedropsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u2018I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be able to live like this.\u2019Zhao Feng was a little absent-minded, and his eyes were also somewhat envious as he looked at Zhang Han and Mengmeng.He had spent these past two years fighting nonstop. The reason for his nickname was because he had used a lot of people\u2019s blood to beat this madman up.At the same time, it was unavoidable for Zhao Feng to have met powerful opponents, and received heavy injuries. However, he still got up, relying on his ruthlessness.There was a reason for people to be unsteady, especially in the underground world. It was a saying of truth!However, there were only a few who were truly ruthless, and Zhao Feng did not like fighting or killing. After seeing Zhang Han at this moment, the yearning for a peaceful life surfaced in his heart.Soon, when I settle the matter with Tang Zhan, I can relax. Finding a wife and having a child, my life in the city, like how the boss lives, is really good.Zhao Feng muttered in his heart, and when he thought of the word girlfriend, Zhao Feng\u2019s gaze subconsciously turned to Liang Mengqi.He had a oval face, big eyes, long hair, a kind heart, a cheerful personality, and a scholarly style. But facing a brave and courageous girl, all of these conditions were the type that Zhao Feng liked.If it weren\u2019t for Tang Zhan, Zhao Feng reckoned that he would not be able to resist chasing after him. But not now.Tang Zhan had already noticed that anyone who followed him would be in danger. Therefore, at this time, Zhao Feng did not plan to consider these private matters.Liang Mengqi seemed to have also felt Zhao Feng\u2019s gaze. He turned his head to take a glance and realized that was really staring at him.What are you looking at!Liang Mengqi glared at Zhao Feng and turned back to continue watching the playful Mengmeng and Zhang Han.To her, the one who had attracted her at the start was Mengmeng. Mengmeng was too adorable, anyone who saw her would have a good impression of her.Gradually, she realised that Zhang Han\u2019s allure was increasing, he was very casual, he had a good personality, he never bothered with anyone, but only had his daughter in his eyes, he was very mysterious, his culinary arts were high, the piano played so well, but she had never heard of him, and furthermore, Zhang Han\u2019s appearance was not bad, and the more she looked, the more handsome he seemed! The more handsome he was, the more powerful he would become!\u201cPaPa, that \u2026 that blade of yours, how fast is it? Mengmeng laid in the PaPa\u2019s embrace and asked.\u201cIt\u2019s because Mengmeng is hungry, so Daddy has to do it a little faster.\u201d Zhang Han chuckled, and kissed Mengmeng\u2019s pink cheeks.\u201cPaPa, you are so nice, you are my \u2026 Eh\u2026 \u201cMy great hero!\u201d Mengmeng said happily.\u201cOf course, Daddy is going to be your hero for life.\u201d Zhang Han said softly.\u201cUgh \u2026\u201d Mengmeng pouted as she thought about it, she felt that she was missing something, she suddenly remembered, and anxiously said: \u201cAlso Mama, PaPa is also a hero, he wants to be a hero for the rest of his life.\u201d\u201cEh \u2026\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s expression froze, he rubbed Mengmeng\u2019s little head and said with a smile: \u201cOkay, whatever Mengmeng says, daddy will listen to Mengmeng.\u201d\u201cHehehe \u2026\u201d PaPa, are you alright \u2026 \u201cOh my\u2026\u201d Overjoyed, Mengmeng gave her a kiss on her cheek.This scene caused the people sitting at the side of the door to feel envy and disappointment in their hearts.They envied Mengmeng for having such a powerful father. The most important thing was that this father loved her so much, indulged her so much, spoiled her so much, and from his attitude, it seemed like he wanted to take care of his daughter till the heavens.They were disappointed, not because their relationship with their father was not that good, but because they had grown up, and could no longer cuddle in their father\u2019s embrace and act shamelessly like Mengmeng. Furthermore, their father was also getting older and older.Zhao Feng no longer had any parents, but he was the most disappointed one present.The tree wants peace but the wind does not stop, the child wants to raise but does not stay.Zhao Feng had not done his duty, and his family had already passed away. This was his greatest regret.Time flew by quickly. After about ten minutes, Zhang Han showed Mengmeng the small set to the kitchen and started working.As for Mengmeng, he did not even want to watch TV anymore. He just sat on the sofa and hummed a song as he watched PaPa cook.At this time, the rice was already cooked. Zhang Han turned on the electric cooker and looked at the amount of rice inside it, which had doubled from yesterday.\u2018The energy of a foodie is very scary\u2026 \u2018Zhang Han helplessly shook his head, and moved the rice together, reminding everyone here that they should not eat the rice that was cooked directly. After going through the experiments of an expert from the Agricultural Academy of Sciences, no matter if it was in the city or the countryside, whether it was a big iron pot, electric cooker or a rice steamer, they should not eat the rice directly, because eating the rice directly \u2026Hot mouth!When the rice was cooked, it could be eaten directly. However, it would be better if it was cold. Moreover, if the rice was stirred, it would maintain a good softness. If the rice was not stirred, the moisture loss would become more real after a while.The potato stew with beans was still around ten minutes away, just as Zhang Han was about to start his second course \u2014 \u2014 Red Braised Eggplant.Braised eggplant is a traditional dish with a long history. It is a fine vegetable dish. Juice was the common food.However, it was a simple task for Zhang Han. In other words, making a fool eat New Moon Bay\u2019s eggplant would not be difficult either.The blade light flashed again, and three eggplants were cut into long segments that had the same shape and size. When he placed them in the steamer to steam, Zhang Han cut the garlic into minced garlic.After the eggplant was steamed and cooked, it cooled down for a moment. Then the oil was poured into the pot and put into the eggplant, garlic, red pepper, old smoked, spring onion, salt, a little sugar and the most important fragrant wood. After stir-frying for a while, a portion of red-braised eggplant was served.Thereafter, Zhang Tian\u2019s hands did not stop moving. Two pots were placed in front of him, and two-thirds of the rice was turned into Egg Fried Rice.\u201cCome and serve us some rice.\u201dZhang Han placed Liang Mengqi and the other two dishes on the counter and waved at Liang Mengqi.\u201cAlright.\u201dLiang Mengqi laughed and took the lead to walk in front of the counter.As he was filling up the rice, Liang Mengqi\u2019s eyes landed on the dishes that Zhang Han had cooked.The food did not have the absorption from the smoke blender, so the fragrance of the dishes wafted up, causing Liang Mengqi to subconsciously swallow his saliva.\u201cIt smells so good, it must be delicious \u2026\u201dHowever, after the food was cooked, Yu Qingqing pushed her away in a hurry, bringing her consciousness back to reality. Liang Mengqi stepped aside and carried the lonely Egg-Fried Rice and milk back to the guest\u2019s small dining table.Zhao Feng stood behind the counter and waited for them to finish eating. Then, he used a paper plate and a paper cup to fill up the Egg-Fried Rice and milk.Smelling the fragrance, Zhao Feng felt that this fragrance was very strong, thus his footsteps could not help but speed up by 30%.When he returned to his seat, he hastily scooped rice into a spoon and put it into his mouth. After tasting the taste, ten thousand bullet screen\u2019s worth of food quickly floated past his heart.\u2018Egg-Fried Rice? \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t believe it! \u2018\u2018When did the Egg Fried Rice become so delicious? \u2018\u2018Is this real Egg-Fried Rice? \u2018 \u2018Is this really Egg-Fried Rice? \u2018After eating the first mouthful, Zhao Feng was unable to stop!One had to know that for someone like him, who was a spy, his endurance was extremely terrifying. However, this kind of endurance seemed to become extremely laughable in front of a plate of Egg-Fried Rice.One could tell from his blurry eyes that he had been conquered by Zhang Han\u2019s Egg-Fried Rice!But it was not only him, Liang Mengqi, Yu Qingqing, Zhao Dahu had also eaten very fast. Seeing this scene, the little princess started to panic.\u201cPaPa, PaPa, they\u2019re already starting to eat. Why aren\u2019t we eating?\u201d Mengmeng pouted and said. After smelling the fragrance for a long time, she was so hungry that she couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\u201cAlright, the last dish will be served!\u201d Zhang Han smiled and poured the last piece of fried egg and tomato into the plate.\u201cLet\u2019s go and eat too.\u201d Zhang Han immediately used a large tray to bring the three dishes, two bowls of rice and two chopsticks to the table.\u201cTime to eat, time to eat \u2026\u201d Mengmeng ran and jumped around beside Zhang Han happily.At this time, other than Zhao Dahu, the other three people had finished eating their Egg-Fried Rice.\u201cIt smells so good, the PaPa is truly a nuisance, it tastes so good \u2026\u201d Mengmeng bit a braised eggplant and praised.\u201cThen eat more.\u201d Zhang Han did not touch the chopsticks, and said gently while smiling at Mengmeng.Fatherly love was like a mountain. Every father\u2019s way of expressing their love was different. They wouldn\u2019t say such exquisite words of love, and most of them would silently use their actions to explain their father\u2019s love.For example, Zhang Han hadn\u2019t said anything to Mengmeng like \u2018I love you\u2019, but his actions had proven his love for Mengmeng, and when he said \u2018eat more\u2019, many parents had said similar words.At this moment, Liang Mengqi looked at Zhang Han with eager eyes. How she wished that Zhang Han would also say this to her: \u201cCome and eat a little too.\u201dBut no!Liang Mengqi was already impatient in his heart. Since you are not saying anything, then this person will say hello, right?Therefore, she licked her lips and endured the embarrassment in her heart, saying, \u201cErm, boss \u2026 Can you\u2026 \u201cAiya, I also want to taste the food you cooked.\u201dSwish!In that moment, the other three gazes turned towards Zhang Han.They didn\u2019t even need to say anything as they expressed their desire with their gazes.Zhang Han\u2019s expression froze for a moment, then he muttered to himself and answered: \u201cNot everyone can eat dishes that I, Zhang Han, cook.\u201dThe rules could not be broken easily, Zhang Han did not doubt the popularity of his restaurant. Eating just one dish would leave one loyal fan behind, moreover, it had only been open for two days, if it started for too long, the number of customers would rise quickly.It was fine to cook a lot of food like Egg-Fried Rice, but did Zhang Han really have to cook for everyone?Impossible.Even for the people in front of him, to be able to eat Egg-Fried Rice was all thanks to Mengmeng.If it was not for the fact that the Mount New Moon was still in the early stages of transformation and was unable to create a residential area, this restaurant would not even be open, thus Zhang Han did not plan to cook for others.Liked it?

A rare flirtatious and bashful expression surfaced on her face as she pleaded in a pleading tone:\u201cAiya, I\u2019m begging you, can you just eat a little bit? You two won\u2019t be able to eat, it\u2019s a waste even if you leave it. Just eat a little. I\u2019m your loyal fan! \u201d\u201cI am also a loyal fan! \u201cBoss, you better not pull me down!\u201d Yu Qingqing quickly agreed.\u201cHe\u2019s also the boss\u2019s brother\u2019s loyal fan.\u201d Zhao Dahu said in a somewhat anxious tone.\u201cCough cough \u2026\u201d Zhao Feng coughed lightly, as if he had not expected such a day to come. He replied in a very soft voice, \u201cI think so too.\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s attitude was still firm.Seeing that Zhang Han had rejected them, Zhao Feng was slightly better. The three of them were a little disappointed and sad.For a foodie, not being able to eat the delicacies they really want to eat was the same as when a smoker was addicted to cigarettes and had nothing to smoke. Oh, no, it was too light. It should be when the addict wasn\u2019t addicted to drugs.Zhang Han ignored their expressions, but the little princess beside him could not bear to see them any longer.Looking at their pitiful expressions, she said in a small voice, \u201cPaPa, why don\u2019t you, why don\u2019t you give some to the big sisters \u2026\u201dIn an instant, hope rose in the eyes of Liang Mengqi, Yu Qingqing, and the others. They knew that Zhang Han cared a lot about Mengmeng!The Little Princess asked, I wonder if Zhang Han will agree to it.At this moment, Liang Mengqi and the other two were extremely nervous, to the point where Zhao Dahu felt that the nervousness they were feeling right now was even more intense than when he was applying for a job.Facing Mengmeng\u2019s words, Zhang Han muttered to himself.One second, two seconds \u2026Amidst the incomparably nervous atmosphere, finally, after ten seconds, Zhang Han turned his head around and said:\u201cIf you want to eat my dishes, that\u2019s fine, but you still have to follow the rules.\u201d\u201cTell me about the rules!\u201d \u201cI agree!\u201d Liang Mengqi quickly nodded and replied.\u201cIn my restaurant, only with a membership card can you eat the dishes I make. The price of the membership card\u2026 If it\u2019s the top ten, then it\u2019s a bit cheaper. One million apiece, and one membership card can only be used by one person. \u201d Zhang Han thought for a while and said.Since Mengmeng had spoken, Zhang Han could make an exception. Since he made an exception, there must be a rule.Originally, Zhang Han planned to make a membership that was at least ten million or more, but since Liang Mengqi and the other two were being \u2018respectful\u2019 to him, then he would give them some face.The moment he said this, everyone was stunned.A 1 million membership card wasn\u2019t something that could be found everywhere, but Liang Mengqi, who had experienced high end clubs, felt that it was worth it.However, one million was quite a sum for Yu Qingqing and Zhao Dahu. After working for a few years, the two of them had saved up to around three million, and if they were to spend a third of it in one go, their hearts would inevitably ache.But after considering for less than two seconds, when they saw the few dishes on Zhang Han\u2019s table, their eyes became resolute.\u201cOkay okay, I want a membership card, I want the first one!\u201d Liang Mengqi\u2019s reaction was the fastest. She quickly responded and stood up before quickly walking towards the kitchen counter. She looked back and forth between the Egg-Fried Rice and the normal rice before deciding to eat rice and vegetables.After scooping some rice, Liang Mengqi brought the plate to Zhang Han and imitated him and said with a pout:\u201cBoss, give it a try, give it a try \u2026\u201dZhang Han sighed in his heart, took her plate, and picked up some of every dish.Liang Mengqi was elated when he saw this.They looked at Mengmeng with gratitude and said: \u201cMengmeng, I really love you to death. You are so nice, thank you, cute little princess Mengmeng!\u201d\u201cHaha \u2026\u201d Hearing the praises, Mengmeng laughed extremely happily, waved her small palm in a decent manner, and replied with her childish voice: \u201cDon\u2019t mention it, little big sis.\u201dLiang Mengqi smiled as he carried the plate back.\u201cBoss \u2026\u201dThe second voice followed closely behind, Yu Qingqing stood beside Zhang Han with the plate: \u201cI want the second membership card, I, I also want to eat a little \u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han gave her some of the food.\u201cThank you.\u201d Yu Qingqing first thanked Zhang Han, then looked at Mengmeng and said: \u201cThank you, Mengmeng, Mengmeng is the most adorable.\u201d\u201cHumph \u2026\u201d \u201cNo, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d Mengmeng waved his hand and replied.\u201cBoss, big brother \u2026\u201d Zhao Dahu also came.After they shared a few more dishes, Zhao Dahu thanked Mengmeng with satisfaction.Mengmeng\u2019s smile became even happier, and she felt like she was a little hero at this moment.However, she was truly a hero in their hearts!At the same time, the three of them came to understand that, as it turns out, Zhang Han cared about Mengmeng. In the future, rather than fawning on him, it would be better to fawn on him instead!They seemed to have found a way to deal with Zhang Han.\u201cEh \u2026.\u201d Boss, I just want the fourth membership card, the food you make is really delicious. \u201d Zhao Feng brought the paper plate over.Helpless, Zhang Han could only give Zhao Feng some of the food, and after giving him some of the food, he only had less than a quarter of the food left.\u201cThank you, Little Princess Mengmeng.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled at Mengmeng, and carried the plate of food back, satisfied.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, you\u2019re welcome \u2026\u201d Mengmeng still happily waved her small arm, but when her clear and large eyes saw that only a few spicy dishes were left on the dining table, she immediately shook her head.\u201cEh?\u201dMengmeng was startled, his mouth pouting as he said: \u201cUuu\u2026 Ugh \u2026 You\u2019re really impolite \u2026 \u201cThere\u2019s only so little left\u2026\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s facial muscles trembled when he heard this. The dishes were split among the four of them, and it seemed like he got the least amount!\u201cEat quickly, Mengmeng.\u201d Zhang Han laughed and shook his head, then said: \u201cI don\u2019t see much, but Mengmeng\u2019s appetite is relatively low, it\u2019s more than enough.\u201d\u201cYes, dinner \u2026\u201d Mengmeng continued to eat. Zhang Han did not touch his chopsticks, but went to the kitchen counter to scoop up a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice and brought it back.After eating for a while, there were only a few dishes left. Mengmeng used her chopsticks to pick up the last piece of Red Braised Eggplant, and looked at it for two seconds, her big eyes telling him that she really wanted to eat it. But in the end, she still reached her chopsticks towards Zhang Han\u2019s bowl.\u201cPaPa, you eat.\u201d Mengmeng said with her childish voice.\u201cDaddy is almost full. Mengmeng, eat.\u201d Zhang Han laughed softly as he used his chopsticks to pick up the Red Braised Eggplant and placed it near Mengmeng\u2019s mouth.It was obvious that she felt Mengmeng had swallowed his saliva, but she curled her lips and said in a small determined voice, \u201cMn, hmph, PaPa will eat it, PaPa will eat it.\u201dZhang Han\u2019s heart trembled at this moment.He didn\u2019t say anything, but his heart felt a little sour. fatherly love was great, but at the same time, the love of a child was also deep. Mengmeng was only three years old, so the love he subconsciously expressed made Zhang Han\u2019s heart feel soft.Zhang Han took the eggplant, and opened his mouth to bite about a quarter of the eggplant.\u201cEn, it\u2019s pretty good. Daddy has already eaten it, eat these Mengmeng s.\u201d Zhang Han placed the remaining third into Mengmeng\u2019s small bowl.\u201cUgh \u2026\u201d Mengmeng likes to eat, PaPa is the best. \u201d This time, Mengmeng did not reject and started to eat with gusto.While they enjoyed the taste buds, they also felt a little guilty. After all, they had split up Mengmeng\u2019s dishes, but at the same time, if they hadn\u2019t split up, such a cozy scene wouldn\u2019t have happened, so the emotions of these people were a little complicated.The reason why they did not think at all was because there weren\u2019t many dishes cooked by Zhang Han, nor did they think that they had the right to eat the dishes that they had spent a million on.Not only them, Zhao Feng\u2019s expression also changed.\u201cHis daughter in his heart\u2026 It\u2019s a weakness, and at the same time, it\u2019s a reverse scale. \u201dZhao Feng muttered in his heart, he had felt Zhang Han\u2019s casual personality, and felt that even if he offended Zhang Han, he would be fine. But if he messed with Mengmeng, then something would definitely happen.It had to be said that Zhao Feng saw things from a deeper angle than others.He didn\u2019t think too much about it. He decided to enjoy the delicacies first.When they had their first mouthful of rice, they suddenly realized that the rice in the restaurant was so fragrant.This fragrance was truly an unparalleled enjoyment of taste buds. Soft, tender, fragrant, everything had to be enjoyed. Even if they were given only rice to eat, they would probably still eat happily.The four of them did not have many dishes, so their actions were similar. They all first savored a small mouthful of each of the three dishes.However, when they ate the first fried tomato and egg, they were stunned.\u2018What\u2019s going on? \u2018\u2018Even a normal fried egg and tomato is so tasty? \u2018\u2018I\u2019m finished. I won\u2019t be able to leave this restaurant in the future. What should I do? \u2018\u201c\u2026\u201dThe four of them carried ten thousand bullet screen s in their hearts and then tasted the beans and stewed potatoes and the braised eggplant.Afterwards, they wanted to control their pace and eat slowly, but they found that their hand speed had unknowingly increased by a lot. As they ate mouthful after mouthful, they suddenly realized that all their rice and vegetables were gone!\u201cGone?\u201d Liang Mengqi looked at the empty plate of food and said with a somewhat dejected tone.She felt that she was only seventy percent full! He could even eat a bowl of rice.\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten my fill \u2026\u201d Yu Qingqing pursed his lips, felt the remaining fragrance in his mouth, and was unable to control himself for a long time.\u201cSigh \u2026\u201d Zhao Dahu only let out a light sigh to express his unsatisfied heart.Zhao Feng, on the other hand, did not make any movements, and only silently picked up the paper cup to taste the milk.From his gaze, it was obvious that he was also sighing at the deliciousness of the food.While these people were indulging in their fantasies, two more guests arrived at the restaurant.A man and a woman, both in their early twenties. The man had dyed blond hair, dressed in famous clothing, with a somewhat arrogant expression, the woman had a good appearance, was tall, but she was inferior to Liang Mengqi.\u201cBoss, give me two servings of your 288 servings of Egg Fried Rice!\u201d The blond youth\u2019s tone was not very good. There was a hint of disdain in his tone, as if he was very dissatisfied with the price of the Egg-Fried Rice.\u201cThe rice is on the counter and the paper plate is on the side. Go and serve it yourself.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d The blonde youth frowned and said in a cold tone: \u201cYou want us to serve our own food?\u201d Is this how you do business? \u201dLiked it?

She looked at the man and said, \u201cDong Heng, the rules of the restaurant has nothing to do with you. Don\u2019t be so rude when you talk.\u201d\u201cAm I rude?\u201d Little Qing, we are guests! Isn\u2019t that we are guest God for the service staff? Actually, this is my first time that I saw customers served their own food. What kind of attitude is this? I think I need to complain to the Consumer Association. \u201d The man sneered, and said to Zhang Han.\u201cOh.\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s expression did not change in the slightest, then he replied indifferently: \u201cThen go and file a complaint.\u201dAfter finished speaking, Zhang Han carried Mengmeng and walked to the sofa.\u201cAiyo?\u201d Little Qing, look at his attitude\u2026 \u201d The blond man\u2019s face was sullen.Before his voice had died away, Liang Mengqi said coldly: \u201cWhat attitude is this? The price is showed at the entrance, and the rules are always there. If you don\u2019t want to eat, then please leave. Do not make a ruckus here. \u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Hum, the boss\u2019s food isn\u2019t prepared for any mortal. If you felt unsatisfied, then go out.\u201d Zhao Dahu rolled his eyes at the golden-haired man as he spoke in a weird tone.\u201cHa ha!\u201d The man sneered and said, \u201cI think you guys are the ones who should be entrusted with this task. What is it? Was it a black shop? \u201d\u201cDong Heng, stop talking.\u201d The woman beside him frowned and said, \u201cWe\u2019re here to have meals. If you don\u2019t want to eat with me, then leave by yourself.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d The golden-haired man shook his head and said, \u201cI just don\u2019t like the service here. It\u2019s fine if you set a higher price, but if the service isn\u2019t good, then what is it?\u201dHis words were obviously meant for Zhang Han, but Zhang Han did not plan to bother with this pretentious bastard.Zhang Han ignored him, but there were people who paid attention to him.After Zhao Feng reluctantly drank the last mouthful of milk, he stood up and walked towards the golden-haired man.When the golden-haired man saw Zhao Feng, his eyes stared with a stupefied expression on his face. It was clear that he recognizeed Zhao Feng.\u201cEat somenthing?\u201dZhao Feng walked in front of the golden-haired man. He did not have much expression on his face, only two words coming out of his mouth.\u201cYes, yes! Brother Feng, why are you here?\u201d The golden-haired man\u2019s expression turned bitter.\u201cIf you want to eat, then it\u2019s good. My table is empty, clean it up and sit there.\u201d Zhao Feng gazed at him a few times, and said: \u201cAlso, from now on, when you come here, you\u2019d better be quiet.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d The golden-haired man hurriedly nodded.The golden-haired man was also a member in Yonghe club. As his family started a small company, he could be considered a rich second generation. They occasionally treated everyone. Zhao Feng met this guy for a few times when he came to the New Moon Bay. He wanted to curry favor with Zhao Feng, but Zhao Feng did not care about it. Thus every time he met Zhao Feng, he would be as if he was a mouse seeing a cat.After Zhao Feng finished speaking, he did not bother to pay any more attention to him. He took his own cup and went to the kitchen to pour another cup of milk, throwing the duster to the golden-haired man when leaving.\u201cWould you mind if I sit here?\u201d Zhao Feng said as he pointed to the empty seat in front of Zhao Dahu.\u201cNo one is here. Take a seat.\u201d Zhao Dahu replied. His behaviors had left a good impression on Zhao Feng.What was the source of such goodwill? That is, to speak for the restaurant and to work for the restaurant.There was no doubt that Zhao Dahu was a protector for Zhang Han\u2019s restaurant.On the other side of the table, four people were leisurely drinking milk. At the furthest table, a blonde young man and a tall woman were eating Egg Fried Rice at a fast pace.Normally, if they had had something delicious, they would praise them a little. But at this moment, Zhang Han\u2019s Egg-Fried Rice had already made them forget their words, and they were completely immersed in it, unable to extricate themselves.As he ate, the golden-haired man\u2019s face flashed with a hint of apology.He seemed to be saying, \u2018The food that the boss cooks is so delicious, but I behaved so badly just now, I really shouldn\u2019t \u2026\u2019However, at this moment, no one paid any attention to them.\u201cBoss.\u201d Seeing that Zhang Han had cleaned up the big dining table, Liang Mengqi immediately said: \u201cAs your first member, can I order a piano piece?\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Zhang Han glanced at her and nodded, \u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cThen I want the piano music at night.\u201d Liang Mengqi said with a smile.Zhang Han nodded slightly and carried Mengmeng who was on the sofa: \u201cLet\u2019s go and play the piano.\u201d\u201cUgh \u2026\u201d It\u2019s not us, but it\u2019s PaPa playing. PaPa, when can Mengmeng play the piano \u2026 \u201d Mengmeng asked with her child\u2019s tone.\u201cMengmeng is so smart. You could play it after a couple of lesson in the future.\u201d Zhang Han chuckled.\u201cIs Mengmeng very smart?\u201d Mengmeng\u2019s eyes lit up, and said happily: \u201cHow, how smart is that?\u201d\u201cEh \u2026\u201d Zhang Han muttered to himself for a while and replied, \u201cMengmeng is the most intelligent little princess of all the realms.\u201d\u201cAll the realms \u2026\u201dWhat is it?\u201d Mengmeng asked curiously.\u201cIt means in all the worlds, Mengmeng is the smartest.\u201d Zhang Han gave a simple explanation.\u201cHaha \u2026\u201d \u201cOh?\u201d Mengmeng kisses Zhang Han on his cheek for a few times, and started to giggle.The little princess really likes PaPa praising her.Zhang Han placed Mengmeng on the small sofa, then sat down and opened the lid.\u201cGive me a piano piece for my lovely Mengmeng.\u201dZhang Han chuckled, and kept silent for ten seconds.Under the gaze of Liang Mengqi and the others, Zhang Han\u2019s hand suddenly moved.The sound of the piano began to move the heartstrings of the crowd.Liang Mengqi looked at Zhang Han\u2019s body from the side as she was in a daze. She felt that the piano pieces that Zhang Han was playing would always have a certain charm to them, as if it was the kind of song that would give rise to feelings.This was a sort of state.Even Zhao Feng\u2019s pupils became a little blurry, his expression still calm. However, his heart followed the rhythm of the piano piece and thought back to his experiences.He could have had a good life, a good career, but when he made his move that time, everything was just a dream.A comrade of his, and his best brother, had been in a trance during a besieging mission against the drug lords, which had resulted in being shot.Lying in Zhao Feng\u2019s embrace, he slowly told Zhao Feng about what had happened.It turned out that on the day of the mission, his family was going to receive a group of uninvited guests. That group of people were from the usury company, and his wife\u2019s father had borrowed money from them once, but after repaying them the money, the company did something about it.He had prepared a leave of absence report, but who would have thought that the final battle with the drug lord would begin? Military orders were like mountains, and he gave up on the idea of returning immediately, intending to rush back through the night after his mission ended.But he did not manage to hold on, and before dying, he asked Zhao Feng to help him with this task.However, in the middle of the night, when Zhao Feng arrived at his comrade\u2019s home, his wife died on her bed. Zhao Feng had really gone crazy at that time and went to the lending company by himself.The boss smiled sinisterly and said that he would send people to visit his comrades\u2019 homes even if he didn\u2019t want to. His lending company was also protected by the law.There was no fear, and only these four words could describe the boss.But Zhao Feng did not care about that, and continued punching the boss until he was out of breath!It was also because of this that he ruined Zhao Feng\u2019s life. If it wasn\u2019t for Tang Zhan committing heinous acts, and if it wasn\u2019t for various reasons, he would have to spend the rest of his life in prison.Even if he came out now, he had to do something very dangerous. After all, that Tang Zhan was cautious and ruthless in his actions, so it was best not to doubt that he was a brainless big brother.\u2018Was that attack worth it? \u2018Sometimes, Zhao Feng would ask himself as well, but after that, he would lightly shake his head and say, \u201cIt\u2019s worth it! \u2018If I were to give him another chance, he would definitely hit me a few more times! \u2018The melodious music quietly ended when Zhao Feng was deep in his thoughts.\u201cPlaying another song, what do you want to hear?\u201d Zhang Han turned slightly to look at Liang Mengqi and the others, and then asked.\u201cCanon Variations, you talked about before.\u201d Liang Mengqi hurriedly replied.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han nodded slightly.When he was ready to play, the blond man opened his mouth:\u201cThat\u2026 Boss, we would like to have another serving. \u201d\u201cGo and enjoy it yourself.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cOkay, okay.\u201dAt this time, the golden-haired man was already extremely warm and polite. It was not only because of Zhao Feng, but also because he was a foodie too.As the golden-haired man was carrying two paper plates to the kitchen counter, a cheerful and rhythmic Canon variation began to play.\u2018The boss plays the piano so well. He is truly mysterious.Zhao Feng sighed in his heart.After the piano piece, Zhang Han put down the lid.Playing two songs at the same time, Zhang Han felt that it was enough. But after putting him down, Mengmeng became a little anxious, she stretched out her arm and said:\u201cHmm, PaPa, don\u2019t put it down, Mengmeng still wants to play it.\u201d\u201cOh, okay, okay. Here, dad will teach you how to play.\u201d Zhang Han hurriedly opened the lid of the piano once again. After embracing Mengmeng, he began to teach Mengmeng how to play the piano:\u201cHere, press this button first, then this one, then this one, and then this one. Also, this one. It\u2019ll be nice if we just connect it together. Try it?\u201d\u201cHaha \u2026\u201d \u201cThis, this, this\u2026\u201d Mengmeng happily used two small fingers to dim down.Zhang Han had taught Mengmeng a song that was very simple yet pleasant to listen to. Mengmeng\u2019s memory was very good, so she followed the sequence and played it well.\u201cDaddy will press the button for you together, then Mengmeng will sing, okay?\u201dAfter learning for a while, Zhang Han reached out his hand, gently grabbed the little princess\u2019 finger, and prepared to play it.\u201cTwinkle twinkle little star. How I wonder what you are!\u201d \u201cHaha \u2026\u201dMengmeng was so happy to play the piano and sing in the arms of PaPa.By the side of the window, Liang Mengqi and the others watched quietly. Even the golden-haired man and the tall girl who had finished eating did not interrupt this heartwarming scene.Liked it?

Oh, and a million yuan membership fee, a total of 1 million and 1 thousand yuan.Liang Mengqi took out her own mobile phone and fiddled with it, taking the bank card from Zhang Han.\u201cBoss, when will we be able to eat meat dishes?\u201d Liang Mengqi asked somewhat curiously.\u201cIn a few days.\u201d Zhang Han replied.Indeed, after a period of time, although suckling pigs and calves could be eaten early, they had just arrived at Mount New Moon, so they had to live there for a while to improve the quality of their meat.Yu Qingqing paid the bill and straightforwardly transferred 1 million and 1 thousand yuan.\u201cHey, boss, I\u2019m fascinated by your food. It seems that I need to earn a lot of money in the future before I can come and eat your food.\u201d Zhao Dahu sighed with emotion, and painfully transferred a third of his assets to another bank.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201d Zhao Feng gave a simple praise and happily transferred the money.Liang Mengqi walked towards the door and suddenly remembered something, she turned to Zhang Han and said: \u201cOh yeah, boss, we have a member, should we have a VIP card?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll find someone to do it tonight.\u201d Zhang Han thought and replied.\u201cOkay, got it. Bye boss, goodbye cute Princess Mengmeng.\u201d Liang Mengqi smiled sweetly and waved her hands twice.\u201cSis, Sis, goodbye!\u201d Mengmeng waved her hands on the sofa.\u201cGoodbye, boss. Goodbye, Mengmeng.\u201d Yu Qingqing waved her hand.\u201d See you, Mengmeng.\u201d Zhao Dahu waved his hand.\u201cBye bye.\u201d Zhao Feng nodded.After they left, the golden-haired man and his female companion walked over.\u201cThere are a total of four servings of Egg Fried Rice and four cups of milk. I would also like to calculate the total amount based on the number of servings. Here is 1 thousand and six hundred yuan.\u201d The blond man handed the money over.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head indifferently. He took the bill and placed it in the drawer.\u201cEh \u2026 um \u2026.\u201d What do it mean by membership card here? Is it a million yuan deposit? \u201d The blond youth could not help but ask.\u201cNo.\u201d Zhang Han shook his head and said: \u201cOne million yuan is just the membership fee. With a membership card, you can eat the dishes I make, but the money for dishes will be additional.\u201d\u201d One million yuan\u2026for the membership cards. \u201d The tall woman\u2019s face changed as she stuck out her tongue: \u201cSo expensive.\u201d\u201cYes, hehe, that\u2026\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re leaving too. Goodbye.\u201dThe golden-haired youth\u2019s pocket money was around 1.89 million a year, and it was even given on a monthly basis. It wasn\u2019t enough for him to buy a membership card, so he decided to leave.Thinking about how they just bought the membership card, the golden-haired man suddenly felt like he was a fake rich second-generation.However, within a few days, the golden-haired man couldn\u2019t resist the temptation and began to raise money to buy a membership card. Of course, that was a story for the future.Just as the golden-haired youth left, Liang Mengqi and the other two opened the door and walked in.\u201cSorry, I forgot to clear away.\u201d Liang Mengqi grinned.The three of them washed the tableware and put it in the cupboard. Zhao Dahu even cleaned up the table of the golden-haired youth.They sat in Yu Qingqing\u2019s Volkswagen.\u201cI finally know what a true delicacy is. I have truly let down my tongue before.\u201d Liang Mengqi posted a message on her WeChat saying that it was accompanied by a photo of him outside the \u2018Mengmeng\u2019s Leisure Restaurant\u2019.Naturally, the beauty\u2019s attention was not low and several comments were immediately sent out.Tiger: \u201cOh, what kind of delicacy did Beautiful Liang discover?\u201dSonghu: \u201cQiqi actually said that? \u201cYour mouth is famous for cleverness. It seems like this restaurant is great.\u201dSociety: \u201cThe moment I opened my mouth, I knew it was an old world, Mengmeng\u2019s restaurant, their food must be also adorable.\u201dLiang Hao asked, \u201cLittle sister, did you eat delicious food? It makes you so happy. \u201dTo her brother\u2019s comment, Liang Mengqi laughed and replied: \u201cBut it\u2019s delicious, and it will be a lifelong regret if you don\u2019t have a try. Brother, wait for you to come, I\u2019ll treat you.\u201dLiang Hao: \u201cHaha, okay, I can\u2019t wait to go. What kind of dinner are you eating?\u201dLiang Mengqi said, \u201cEgg-Fried Rice, milk, a little egg and fried tomatoes, beans and stewed potatoes, and braised eggplant.\u201dSociety: \u201cPuff, spurt blood, isn\u2019t this just a regular dish? You can even do it yourself. \u201dLiang Mengqi: \u201cWhat do you know? Boss\u2019s dish is unique in heaven and earth. One Egg Fried Rice costs two hundred and eighty yuan, one cup of milk costs eighty yuan. Do you know how much the membership card will cost? A million, and only you have a membership card, you can eat the dishes that the boss made himself, hmph! \u201dSociety: \u201c\u2026\u201dLittle did she know that Zhang Han had already changed the price.Since the start of the competition, Zhang Han had not received a single serving of the Egg Fried Rice. Since then, he had only received a maximum of two hundred eight servings, so he might as well change the price so that he did not feel like giving a tip every time.Zhang Han would often tip others, but he did not like others to tip him, so he did not need it himself.But what Zhang Han did not know was that, not long after, the several hundred yuan that was spent in the dining hall also turned into smithereens.1 \u2013 10 membership cards, each priced at 1 million, 11-20 membership cards at 10 million, If you have membership cards, you are eligible to eat the day\u2019s dishes. Household dishes: Vegetables cost 200 yuan, a little, meat cost 400, a little.After writing this, Zhang Han looked at it for a bit. After confirming that there were no errors, he returned to the dining hall and prepared to pack up with Mengmeng and order a membership card.Zhao Dahu also posted a similar message on his Wechat Moment. His WeChat friends were a lot more, almost full of people. After all, he was the Deputy Director of the Media Company back then.There were a lot of people who paid attention to him. After he sent out his Wechat Moment, the number of comments immediately exceeded 50, which was much more than Liang Mengqi.There was also the golden-haired man and the tall lady. They were all showing off their friends, but what they said was that they discovered a particularly tasty restaurant.However, Zhao Feng didn\u2019t do such a thing, he only returned to the company quietly and did what he needed to do normally.With the promotion of a few people in the friends circle, Zhang Han\u2019s restaurant would probably welcome a new batch of customers tomorrow.At the same time, inside Xue Qian\u2019s house.\u201cAiyo, why isn\u2019t he replying yet?\u201d Li Fan was already starting to crumble. From the very beginning, he instantly refreshed his web page in 2 seconds and turned it into a minute later, and then in ten minutes. He sat in front of his computer until now, staring at the same thing for a few hours.\u201cHe didn\u2019t leave a number. If he doesn\u2019t reply by the 13th, then should I sing this song or not? Sigh, if I can\u2019t sing it, then I will feel very upset.\u201d Xue Qian shook his head lightly at the side.Xue Qian had to go to the Lin Hai City to prepare for the concert on the 15th. On the seventh day, if Mr. \u2018Hanyang\u2019 did not reply and the song was not well discussed, he would not be able to feel at ease.\u201cAiyo, hurry up and reply, Big Brother, I\u2019m begging you\u2026\u201d Li Fan laughed bitterly as he looked at the screen and muttered.\u2026\u2026Zhang Han and Mengmeng had got well-prepared and were going to the Central District\u2019s lotus alley to make their membership cards. There was also an antique street there. Zhang Han planned to go there and take a look.After driving for around half an hour, Zhang Han arrived at the Central Ring Road.First, he went to a rather high-end membership card shop.After communicating with the waiter for a while, Zhang Han decided on the style of the membership card.What he wanted was a membership card made out of metal, with Zhang Han\u2019s signboard in front. A cartoon image of Mengmeng with the words\u2019 Mengmeng\u2019s Leisure Restaurant \u2018written on the side, there were 1-20 numbers in circles, and on the back of the card there was carved a blooming lotus.However, Zhang Han chose the best material for the metal card and the white words required a platinum material. On the four corners of the membership card, Zhang Han also needed to insert a diamond.Thus, a membership card costed for fifty thousand, with twenty membership cards, Zhang Han had to pay five hundred thousand as a deposit, and the other half would be paid after delivery tomorrow.Twenty membership cards coasted a million yuan, but Zhang Han was not lacking in money right now, he had just earned 4 million, adding the 400 thousand yuan ago, even if he spent 1 million, he would still have 3.4 million.\u201cLet\u2019s go and see if we can buy some good stuff.\u201d Zhang Han carried Mengmeng and walked towards the Antique Street.\u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019ll buy, we\u2019ll buy, we\u2019ll buy!\u201d Mengmeng had no resistance to shopping, no matter what it was, she would just buy it!Arriving at the antique market, there were numerous stalls lining the two sides of the street. There were porcelain, paintings, jade artifacts, and even miscellaneous items.Painting and calligraphy were Chinese drawing and handwriting. Jade artifacts were carved from jade, containing ancient jade and modern jade. There were many types of jade bracelets, beads, jade pendants, decorations, rings and so on.Miscellaneous items included bamboo, wood, teeth, horns, four treasures of the study, embroidery, copper items, and some items that could not be prepared for categorization such as decorations, bracelet, walnuts and so on.Hong Kong\u2019s antique market could be said to be renowned globally. Many collectors from different countries would buy the antiques auction, and there were a lot of people on this antique street.\u201cSo many people, so many things, PaPa, what are we going to buy?\u201d Mengmeng asked curiously as she looked around at her surroundings.\u201cTake a look around. I\u2019ll buy whatever you like.\u201d Zhang Han replied with a light smile.Carrying Mengmeng, Zhang Han walked inside as he started to use the Treasure-sniffing nose on the vendor.Right now, he could use Treasure-sniffing nose s to cover an area of about a meter. Circulating his spirit energy, he only needed to sniff a few times before Zhang Han left the first booth.The stall owner\u2019s words were pleasant.\u201cThis is a porcelain vase from the Tang Dynasty. It costs twenty thousand yuan.\u201d\u201cYoung man, this bracelet is extraordinary. It is an authentic jade. If you want it, I can give it to you for a cheaper price.\u201d\u201cHow much is it?\u201d\u201cEighteen thousand.\u201d\u201cYoung man, look at this pendant. It\u2019s pretty good. Hey, hey, hey. Why are you leaving?\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - TaobaoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euZhang Han gave the second stall a few glances, and then headed over. The first stall did not have a single item that was real. Just two of them smelled a little better, but they were not some historical relic that the stall owner was talking about.The same was true for the second booth.The third, fourth, fifth \u2026Along the way, there were roughly forty to fifty stalls, but not a single one was genuine.Currently, Zhang Han had already used two-thirds of his spirit energy, so he did not plan to stroll around the small stalls and prepared to walk around the shops on both sides of the street.Not all of the goods in the store were real, and it could be said that there were very few real ones, but the possibility of the real ones was much higher than the ones outside.Other than a few small accessories that Mengmeng had picked up, there were no other gains at the stall.They walked into a shop called the Wanqing Antique. The store was relatively large, and there were quite a few customers inside as well. They were all sizing up the items on the shelves.\u201cJade is made from the essence of the stone and is combined with craftsmanship, so it is called Hetian jade. Young miss, this Hetian jade bracelet is lovely, and can be considered as the best gift.\u201dAn old man smiled and said to a ponytailed woman of about twenty-four to twenty-five years of age.The grey-haired old man was the shop owner of the Evergreen Ancient Store. His name was Qian Ming, and the ponytail woman was the daughter of the Evergreen Group\u2019s chairman, Lin Xue.Of course, the Wanqing Group was a group that focused on the old industry. They had the Wanqing Antique Store, Wanqing Jewelry Store, and other related industries.Lin Xue had come here this time because it was the birthday of an elder in the corporation. She had come to choose a birthday present.\u201cThis is not bad. Elder Qian, then could this be a bit cheap?\u201d Lin Xue said somewhat hesitantly.\u201cNeither.\u201d Qian Ming shook his head and said, \u201cJade has spiritual nature, and is non-affiliated with others. It is soft and smooth, just like a baby\u2019s skin, instantly giving off resonance with others. The jade color is smooth and smooth, just like a quiet and elegant beauty.\u201d Qian Ming shook his head and said.\u201cChuffing \u2026\u201d Lin Xue laughed and said: \u201cAlright, then that\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cEn, Little Liu, wrap this jade bracelet for Eldest Miss.\u201d Qian Ming said to a young man.\u201cYes, sir!\u201d The man picked up the jade bracelet and retreated.Just then, Zhang Han held Mengmeng, standing a few meters away and looking at the items on the shelves. Mengmeng did not understand even after hearing Qian Ming\u2019s words and whispered into Zhang Han\u2019s ears: \u201cPaPa, then, what did the old grandpa say?\u201d\u201cSome knowledge about Jade, which can be said to be nonsense.\u201d Zhang Han laughed and replied.\u201cThen why does that old grandpa look so weird when he\u2019s speaking?\u201d The old man\u2019s words carried a bit of ancient wisdom. Adults might feel the words were refined, but the child wouldn\u2019t understand it well.Especially since Mengmeng grew up in North America, she was able to speak Mandarin fluently and efficiently. As for the words spoken by the old man, the Little Princess was a little confused.\u201cIt\u2019s just a few words. Mengmeng doesn\u2019t need to understand them right now. You will understand them in the future.\u201d Zhang Han laughed as he rubbed Mengmeng\u2019s head.\u201cOh \u2026\u201d Mengmeng nodded her head obediently; suddenly her eyes saw a small jade fish three meters away from the cabinet. The fish was carved in a lively manner, and its tail had a small dot as a support point. Its head raised upwards, and there was a small pearl in its mouth.\u201cSo beautiful.\u201d Mengmeng imitated the shape of the fish\u2019s mouth and pouted with an adorable golden mouth.Her cute appearance made Lin Xue, who accidentally saw her, suddenly frozen.\u2018This little girl is so cute! \u2018Lin Xue praised from the bottom of her heart as she stared at Mengmeng.\u201cMengmeng is the most beautiful.\u201d Zhang Han chuckled.Just as he said that the jade fish suddenly fell towards Mengmeng\u2019s direction.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe old man, Qian Ming\u2019s gaze, swept between Xiao Yu and Mengmeng a few times before he walked over and said with a smile:\u201cThe candidate jade is inevitable, but the choice of jade is a coincidence. It seems that this piece of jade is fated to belong to this little girl.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Mengmeng\u2019s eyes lit up as she chuckled and said, \u201cPapa, he said that there\u2019s fate between Little Fishy and me.\u201d\u201cBuy it then.\u201dZhang Han laughed and shook his head; it didn\u2019t matter if the jade fell by accident or not, it didn\u2019t matter if the shop manager was deceiving him since he could make Mengmeng smile, he could buy it.\u201cWhat a beautiful girl.\u201d Lin Xue smiled and sized Mengmeng up a few times, then looked at Zhang Han and laughed: \u201cElder Qian, give this guest a 50% discount for the jade.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Qian Ming nodded.\u201cThere\u2019s no need \u2026\u201d Just as Zhang Han wanted to refuse, he tapped his forehead lightly and turned around to leave.In the end, Zhang Han paid a 50% discount on the jade and bought it for eighty thousand gold.While packing, Zhang Han took the ancient jade and sniffed it lightly.\u201cInteresting \u2026\u201dZhang Han\u2019s eyes narrowed. This piece of jade looked like an ordinary ancient jade, but Zhang Han could smell a trace of other odors in the center of the jade. It was the unique aura of a treasure.However, this hint of smell could not be felt by Zhang Han, because he could only use the weak ability of the Treasure-sniffing nose, and he would have to wait for his strength to increase in the future before he could use this ability.Using an early stage Qi Cultivating Stage to search for treasures was equivalent to physical labor. Zhang Han did not plan to do this, with the Yuan Qing Tree here, he would be able to advance to the Foundation Stage in a year, and that would be the start of the treasure hunt.Furthermore, when he came out to make a membership card this time, he would take a stroll and find some treasures.Mengmeng had brought him good luck.After exiting the door, Zhang Han carried Mengmeng and walked toward the beginning of the street, planning to complete their stroll in the antique shop and then return home.Every time he entered a shop, Zhang Han would circulate his spirit energy and use the Treasure-sniffing nose to smell around, but the reality was that there were antiques and no treasures in the shop.Very quickly, Zhang Han\u2019s spirit energy was almost used up. In the last third shop, finally, Zhang Han smelled the scent of a treasure.\u201cHow much is this?\u201d Zhang Han said as he held out a rusty copper coin.\u201cThree thousand.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201dZhang Han smiled and paid for the copper coin.Zhang Han stopped shopping at the last two shops and headed straight towards the parking area.\u201cPaPa, the round thing you chose is so ugly \u2026\u201d Mengmeng said with her sweet voice.\u201cEh \u2026.\u201d Although it is a little ugly, it is a good thing. Mengmeng, sometimes ugly things can also be good things. \u201d Zhang Han laughed and said.\u201cUgly, good?\u201d Mengmeng did not understand.\u201cYeah, look, for example, that Fire Dragon Fruit doesn\u2019t look too good, right? But it\u2019s eating pretty good, and the squid, and it looks ugly, but the grilled squid tastes good, and there are some people. \u201dWhen talking about people, Zhang Han\u2019s expression became stern, and said in a deep voice: \u201cSome people are ugly, but they have a kind heart, and some people are beautiful with a venomous heart, so, Mengmeng, when you meet boys in the future, no matter how beautiful they are, you cannot let them approach you, do you understand?\u201d\u201cNo, no!\u201d That Mama is wonderful and kind. PaPa is also very handsome and kind. \u201cMengmeng said as she blinked her bright and clear eyes.\u201cDaddy\u2019s kindness is only towards Mengmeng.\u201d Zhang Han laughed as he rubbed Mengmeng\u2019s head.Zhang Han was not a bad person, but he was far from a kind person. In the Cultivation World, where strength was respected and cruel, no one would show kindness for no reason, and no one would show mercy to the heavens and treat anyone else well. This was because you did not know when someone would stab you in the back.Of course, family love, love and friendship were universal in the Cultivation World, and that kind of precaution was only used against those who were not close to him.\u201cHmm, there\u2019s still Mama \u2026\u201d Every time this happened, Mengmeng would always say these words. In her heart, she hoped that the relationship between PaPa and Mama was good.\u201cSure, and her.\u201d Zhang Han laughed as he shook his head.As he said that, Zhang Han walked to the front of the car, and called.\u201cZhang Han.\u201d Zi Yan called out Zhang Han\u2019s name as usual.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han replied as usual, but this time, Zhang Han knew to say one more sentence, and just as she was about to let out a light snort, Zhang Han asked: \u201cHow\u2019s the recording going?\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d On the other end of the phone, Zi Yan still snorted lightly, but a smile still rose on her face. She took a deep breath and said: \u201cThere\u2019s still the last song, I can record it in two days. I\u2019ll be flying at 7 o\u2019clock in the afternoon on the 10th, and we\u2019ll reach Hong Kong International Airport at 10 PM.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so careful?\u201d Zhang Han pouted and muttered.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s voice rose by three decibels.\u201cA cough, I understand, I will bring Mengmeng to pick you up at ten-thirty.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cWhat is it? \u201cYou don\u2019t want to come and pick me up?\u201d Zi Yan asked.Zhang Han originally wanted to reply with \u201cWasting my time.\u201dBut when the words were just about to reach his mouth, Zhang Han looked at Mengmeng who was blinking her large eyes as she looked at him and finally replied: \u201cNo, I\u2019m very willing to work for you. I\u2019ll be there at the airport on time at ten.\u201dAs expected, as he said these words, Mengmeng\u2019s large eyes were filled with happiness.Of course, it was not only Mengmeng who was happy. Zi Yan also smiled slightly and asked: \u201cHow is Mengmeng? What are you eating today? \u201d\u201cHousehold dishes: fried tomatoes with eggs, boiled potatoes with beans, and fried eggplant.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cDo you even know how to cook? Can you eat it? Don\u2019t touch Mengmeng. Beans must be appropriately prepared. Zi Yan said with worry.\u201cIf my customers were to hear your words, they would bombard you.\u201d Zhang Han smiled lightly.What kind of joke was this? In Mengmeng\u2019s casual restaurant, a fan would come, and it was a loyal fan.Zhang Han did not doubt that if he were to exchange his membership cards for a hundred yuan each, he would be robbed crazily.Liked it?

    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - A treasure with chicken ribsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat is it? How many loyal customers are there already? \u201d Zi Yan asked curiously.\u201cYes, they eat three meals a day at my place.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cLooks like you have some skills \u2026\u201dSitting at the back of the carriage, Zhang Han chatted with Zi Yan for a while.In the end, Mengmeng was getting more anxious as she waited. She couldn\u2019t understand why PaPa and Mama would spend so much time to talk each time.At Mengmeng\u2019s urging, Zhang Han handed the phone over to Mengmeng and drove towards New Moon Bay.After half an hour, Mengmeng reluctantly ended the call when she returned to the dining hall.In the bedroom on the second floor, after Zhang Han coaxed the Little Princess to sleep, he softly and slowly walked to the living room.He opened the small antique bag that he bought, took out the copper coin, and started to read it carefully.\u201cIt\u2019s time to see your true face!\u201dZhang Han smiled slightly.Although the copper coin was stained with rust, it was a first stage spirit treasure! It was likely that under this rust, there was a treasure that was like an unpolished jade.A green light surfaced in Zhang Han\u2019s eyes as he circulated his spirit energy in his fingers, forcing out a drop of fresh red blood, and dripped it onto the copper coin.\u201cRefine!\u201dZhang Han muttered softly. He held the copper coin tightly between his thumb and forefinger and began refining the first stage of the spiritual treasures. Waves of extremely dim multicolored light flickered and leaped about on his fingers.This was also the reason why Zhang Han\u2019s strength was relatively low. It was because the Qi Refining Stage did not have any Spiritual Awareness to use.If he had spirit sense, he could directly use it to refine the treasure. Now, Zhang Han could only use his blood as a medium and use it to improve the richness by continuously pouring spirit energy into it.It had to be known that Spiritual Awareness was the most basic energy. As one\u2019s cultivation level increased, Spiritual Awareness would gradually transform into a consciousness. With Spiritual Awareness, it would have quite a lot of attacking power and could use more and more functions.It took Zhang Han an entire hour to successfully refine the pellet.However, after obtaining the information on the treasure, Zhang Han did not rejoice at their success. When he opened his eyes, he spat out a few words in disdain.\u201cSo trashy?\u201dZhang Han took the copper coin and looked at it. The rust on the copper coin had disappeared entirely, and what replaced it was a severe bronze coin.However, its capabilities, in Zhang Han\u2019s opinion, were too weak. Even he used the word \u2018trash\u2019 to describe it.Its function is to\u2026 For example, if Zhang Han wanted to, he could immediately change his appearance to Zi Yan or someone else. This treasure formed a light wave on the surface of a person\u2019s body, using transformation to confuse them.But for Zhang Han, there was no increase in his strength at all, no function he desired at all. This was just a useless treasure.They didn\u2019t know that if these treasures were found out by the assassins, they would be called saint artifacts!The fact that they could transform meant that they could freely enter the enemy\u2019s territory, which said that they were in an invincible position.However, it was useless in Zhang Han\u2019s eyes. He felt that he could only change Zi Yan\u2019s outer appearance when his family was out shopping, and the distance between the copper coin and the spellcaster was not more than 30 meters.\u201cWhat lousy thing is this?\u201dZhang Han casually threw the copper coin on the tea table.Picking up the little fish that Mengmeng had set her eyes on, he smelt it with the Treasure-sniffing nose.It was still the same situation, the smell was ancient jade, but there was something strange in the center of the jade.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dZhang Han muttered to himself as his fingers pinched the jade pearl on the fish\u2019s mouth.\u201cCrack!\u201dAs the spiritual energy moved through his finger, it broke the bead that was on the fish\u2019s mouth.Zhang Han used the Treasure-sniffing nose once again, and this time, he could smell the unique fragrance of a treasure.\u201cSo it\u2019s a Jade-fire dew.\u201dZhang Han\u2019s eyes revealed a hint of understanding. This ancient jade was Yang Jade, and in a hot environment, it could produce Jade-fire dew. It was just like how Black Hair and Niu had a chance to grow into Kobe beef.This Jade-fire dew had only been around for a hundred years, so it could be considered a first-class spirit treasure, which was very close to the level of second-stage spirit treasure. Its energy was extraordinarily violent and could increase its strength a little, but Zhang Han did not plan to use it.Moreover, if Zhang Han did not use the Qi Refining Stage, absorbing the Jade-fire dew would be okay, but the absorption process of the Qi Refining Stage would not be as effective. Furthermore, the Jade-fire dew was not pure.\u201cPut it in the thunder yang tree tomorrow.\u201dZhang Han placed the small fish back in the bed, then went to his bedroom to rest.At night, he did not turn on his computer, which made everyone anxious, and that was Li Fan, who was standing in front of his computer.He had no idea how many emails he had sent to Han Yang, but all of them were like stones sent to the ocean, no news at all.This made him feel very helpless. When it was 12 o\u2019clock, he went to rest with a headache.\u2026\u2026The next day, Mengmeng woke up at six in the morning and took her to the Mount New Moon to absorb the Jade-fire dew s from the Ancient Jade Fish.Right now, there was no good target for it. Although Little Black could use it, it had already absorbed a trace of the fifth-stage spirit treasure\u2019s essence and pure Yang energy. If he were to incorporate Jade-fire dews, it would just be adding flowers to the flower pot. It would be such a waste.As for absorbing it, it would be too painful, so Zhang Han could only keep it for now. It made Zhang Han feel that it was the same as the copper coin, a somewhat useless thing.It was nearly seven o\u2019clock when he returned to the dining room.At this time, Liang Mengqi, Yu Qingqing, Zhao Dahu, and Zhao Feng were already standing in front of the dining hall, waiting.The two of them occasionally spoke a few words to Zhao Dahu. It was evident that they had come here out of curiosity because of Zhao Dahu\u2019s wechat moments.\u201cNice to meet you, Boss, Mengmeng.\u201d Liang Mengqi took the lead and greeted Zhang Han upon seeing him.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han nodded indifferently.Mengmeng was much more enthusiastic as she raised her right hand and greeted, \u201cHello, little sis \u2026\u201d\u201cBoss, what are we eating today?\u201d Liang Mengqi asked again.\u201cEgg-Fried Rice in the morning.\u201d Zhang Han answered as he opened the door.\u201cThere\u2019s no dishes?\u201d Yu Qingqing asked.When she was about to sleep, she was a little hungry. When she closed her eyes, all she could see were the Egg-Fried Rice, the white rice and the three dishes. Immediately, Yu Qingqing felt her stomach rumbling with hunger, to the point that she couldn\u2019t take it anymore.Under normal circumstances and extreme hunger, Yu Qingqing would definitely eat all of the instant noodles in one go, and the food was very fragrant, but this time, while smelling the instant noodles, Yu Qingqing ate it woodenly, and then threw it out, feeling that the food was tasteless.Therefore, she poured all the noodles into the bowl. She couldn\u2019t eat anymore and couldn\u2019t eat anymore. However, she closed her eyes and recalled the figures of the Egg Fried Rice again.In the end, Yu Qingqing struggled for a long time before finally falling asleep after counting the number of times:\u201cA bowl of Egg-Fried Rice.\u201d\u201cTwo bowls of Egg-Fried Rice.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c1,123 bowls of scrambled eggs \u2026\u201dAt this moment, Yu Qingqing looked at Zhang Han with an incredibly intimate gaze. At the same time, she had made up her mind that she would need to sleep early in the future, and if she got hungry while staying up, she would need to suffer for at least two hours before falling asleep.Facing Yu Qingqing\u2019s question, Zhang Han shook his head and said:\u201cIt\u2019s simpler in the morning. There are no dishes prepared, only Egg Fried Rice and milk.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Yu Qingqing nodded, her expression revealing her disappointment. She had been hungry for most of the night and wanted to eat more. The Egg-Fried Rice seemed not to be enough to satisfy a glutton like her.The more one ate, the more one would want. This was also a regular occurrence in the human world.Seeing Yu Qingqing\u2019s expression, Zhao Dahu rolled his eyes. When Zhang Han opened the door and walked in, he said: \u201cBoss, your way of cooking is wrong. There is a saying: You have to eat well for breakfast, eat well for lunch, and eat less for dinner.\u201d\u201cThere is a scientific basis for this statement. Breakfast is good for nutrition because the human body has not eaten for ten hours in the morning. His stomach is empty, and his blood sugar level has also dropped to the point where he needs to eat. If he doesn\u2019t eat well, he will feel tired, tired, irritable, irritable, and slow down, so he has to eat the best breakfast.\u201dZhao Dahu acted as if he was an expert, and said while shaking his head:\u201cYou have to eat well for lunch because lunch is a transfer station, so you can only ensure enough energy supply. As for dinner, eating less won\u2019t burden your stomach and intestines, and it won\u2019t cause too much fat, and it\u2019s also because people don\u2019t have much activity at night.\u201dZhao Dahu\u2019s series of words caused Liang Mengqi and the others to give him a thumbs up.\u201cOh?\u201d Zhang Han slightly smiled, looked at him strangely, and said: \u201cThen the amount of food for your dinner \u2026 \u201cThat seems to be a bit out of line; then I\u2019ll cook less for you guys from now on.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Zhao Dahu cried in alarm, \u201cNo! \u201cBoss, big brother, just take what I just said for fart.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right; he\u2019s farting.\u201d Yu Qingqing said anxiously: \u201cThe original words are: breakfast, lunch, dinner must all be full, not even a single meal can be missed, and the most scientific one is even a midnight snack!\u201d\u201cMidnight snack?\u201d Zhang Han could not help but laugh.\u201cAlright, the boss, we are just joking.\u201d Liang Mengqi lightly pushed Yu Qingqing and laughed: \u201cWhatever boss does, we will eat. Do you think that the boss will mistreat Little Princess Mengmeng? We are all borrowing the glory of Little Princess Mengmeng. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to eat Egg-Fried Rice. \u201d\u201cErr\u2026\u201d \u201cYes, yes, yes.\u201d Yu Qingqing grinned and laughed. She was a little embarrassed and felt that her reaction was a little too extreme. She looked at Mengmeng and laughed: \u201cI have to thank Mengmeng properly.\u201d\u201cYes, how could we have eaten such a delicious meal without Mengmeng.\u201d Zhao Dahu agreed.\u201cHaha \u2026\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re welcome; you\u2019re welcome \u2026\u201d Mengmeng chuckled and waved her hands with them, looking very happy.Liked it?

    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - Exquisite dishesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Zhang Han rubbed Mengmeng\u2019s head and said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, in the future, the food will be more and better. And I guarantee it; there will be a lot of delicious foods that you have never eaten before.\u201d\u201cReally? Boss, can you tell me what\u2019s inside?\u201d Liang Mengqi and the rest\u2019s eyes lit up.Even the silent Zhao Feng was suddenly in high spirits and looked at Zhang Han with shining eyes.\u201cFor example, fruits, crystal peaches, red heart apples, Ksitigarbha persimmon, Nine Flavors Immortal Pears, and various kinds of meat you have not eaten before, such as delicious Dark Shadow Wolf, Dark Demon Tiger, and even Azure Dragon meat. You might have the chance to taste these in the future, but recently you can eat Kobe beef meat, Tai Lake Black Swine meat, and Dark Pearl Mu Qin sheep, these meat are all over the 5A level.\u201d Zhang Han slowly said.In the vast universe, there were enough food ingredients, also there were plenty of delicious foods. It would take a long time, and in the future, when Zhang Han\u2019s cultivation level increases, he could still treat them a try or two.However, they only had a possibility, whereas Mengmeng had to be able to eat it because as Zhang Han\u2019s daughter, her life had already begun to lengthen indefinitely.As for Liang Mengqi and the others, they were only mortals after all. If it took Zhang Han a hundred years to leave Earth, then what were they waiting for? He had probably become a pile of bones long ago.Everyone listened until they were confused, not knowing what Zhang Han was talking about, but now, no matter if they were fruits or meat, they were all sorts, so they subconsciously thought that Zhang Han was talking about some imported good stuff, but in the end, they had heard of the Kobe beef meat, Tai Lake Black Swines, and Wu Zhu Mu Qin, especially the last sentence that surpassed the 5A grade meat!\u201cThere\u2019s even meat beyond the 5A rank?\u201d Liang Mengqi\u2019s small mouth gaped open, as she said with some surprise.\u201cForget about 5A; there are even those that have surpassed 10A.\u201d Zhang Han chuckled.\u201cWah!\u201d \u201cThen, when will we be able to eat meat?\u201d Yu Qingqing said excitedly.You are all members of the restaurant, I will cook for Mengmeng, and you all have your share, so don\u2019t worry. Zhang Han shook his head and said.\u201cOkay, okay. Then what do we eat in the morning?\u201d Yu Qingqing asked again.\u201cEgg Fried Rice.\u201d Zhang Han replied.His words were like a bucket of cold water thrown over their heads, bringing them back to their senses.Just now, they had all been lost in their endless reverie. They had been filled with hunger and thirst for the plum blossom. Anyone could see the anticipation in their eyes.\u201cDirector Zhao, this boss knows how to trick people. Your eyes are turning green from talking about it.\u201dThe two people who came with Zhao Dahu whispered:\u201cYeah, his words are too godly. Is the food here really that good?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it just Egg-Fried Rice? I often eat it. It seems that every dish has the same taste. The Egg-Fried Rice here is excellent. I can\u2019t possibly taste something else, can I?\u201dThis person did not believe him from the start.However, when he tasted the first mouthful of Egg-Fried Rice \u2026His expression completely changed. It was as if he was worshipping someone. With incomparable respect, he quickly finished up the Egg-Fried Rice, then asked for a second serving. After that, he also asked for a second serving.This scene caused Mengmeng to be a little surprised, and she even whispered into Zhang Han\u2019s ear:\u201cPapa, Papa, look, that little brother has eaten three servings\u2026\u201dWhen Zhang Han saw this, he could not help but smile. He had seen people who could only dry three bowls of wine, but he had never seen anyone who could eat three bowls of Egg-Fried Rice.This person had eaten three servings in a row, but he didn\u2019t know that this record had been broken in just a few days by eating four meals in a row.After eating three servings of rice and drinking two cups of milk, the man burped and said with a face full of emotion:\u201cThis is not Egg Fried Rice; it is simply divine. Heavens, I can taste the taste of life. Ah, what should I do? I still want to eat \u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t f * king eat it, who\u2019s going to take responsibility if you push yourself to death?\u201d His companion said snappily.He was not only trying to persuade him to eat less, but he was also muttering in his heart:\u2018Damn it; I\u2019m treating you to a meal! This guy is looking forward to death! \u2018 \u201cThree servings of rice and two cups of milk, how much money is that ah, ah, ah \u2026\u201dThe man paid the bill in heartache and left the restaurant sorrowfully.The reason why he felt sad was that he thought that he had to spend a lot of money to come here to eat. The most important thing was \u2026 The salary was not enough!He didn\u2019t even have money to eat. This was an intense thing to do.Liang Mengqi and the other two had only left after washing all the tableware, but when Zhao Feng saw this, he felt that he could already buy a set of tableware.After everyone left, it was 8 o\u2019clock in the morning. Zi Yan called them daily.After chatting with Zhang Han for a while, the two of them started to talk on the phone more. Sometimes, Zi Yan would tell Zhang Han some exciting things about how to record a video while Zhang Han would say to him some things about playing with Mengmeng.This kind of conversation allowed their relationship to improve by a lot. That kind of strange feeling began to melt away.It was just that this made Mengmeng a little unhappy, and they continued to argue, \u201cPaPa, Mai Guang spoke to you, hmm \u2026 As time passes, I have been talking with Mengmeng less and less\u2026 \u201dFor the entire morning, Zhang Han accompanied the Little Princess to watch the cartoon show. After watching it for two hours, Zhang Han and Mengmeng started to paint and play again.\u201cPaPa, guess what I drew?\u201d Mengmeng drew a face.It had a rough appearance and a distant face. Its eyes were two small dots, two of its nostrils were slightly big, and its mouth was a horizontal line. There were only three or two wavy strands of hair on its head.\u201cPigs?\u201d Zhang Han said in a hesitant tone.\u201cHumph, he\u2019s not a pig.\u201d Mengmeng was surprised for a moment, and said with dissatisfaction: \u201cPaPa, take a closer look, see if it looks like PaPa or not.\u201d\u201cPuff \u2026\u201d \u201cA cough\u2026\u201d The corner of Zhang Han\u2019s mouth twitched, and he invented suspicion as he said: \u201cThen let me guess, huh? Mengmeng seemed to be drawing \u2026 It\u2019s me. \u201d\u201cEh? Really? Did PaPa manage to see through it? \u201d Mengmeng\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cAiya! Isn\u2019t father that Mengmeng drew? \u201cHaha, it\u2019s wonderful. It looks just like daddy.\u201d Zhang Han revealed a gentle and happy smile and said something that went against his heart.\u201cHaha \u2026\u201d PaPa, PaPa, is already a handsome man \u2026 \u201d Receiving the praise of the PaPa, Mengmeng was very happy.Amidst the noise, she drew another \u2018Mama\u2019 beside PaPa.Looking at \u2018Zi Yan\u2019 whose face was longer than a donkey and had eyes like sesame seeds, Zhang Han chuckled.He was afraid that if Zi Yan saw it, her expression would be interesting.After drawing the PaPa and Mama, Mengmeng wanted to bring herself again.\u201cEh?\u201dMengmeng happily finished drawing and was stunned. Looking at her drawing, she was not satisfied at all, then she pouted and said: \u201cI don\u2019t look like it, this doesn\u2019t look like Mengmeng \u2026 \u2026\u201dIn her heart, Mengmeng should be cute just like the picture on the restaurant board.\u201cCome on, the father will draw a Mengmeng \u2026\u201dZhang Han quickly picked up his pen to save the situation.The entire morning passed with laughter and cheers.Near midnight, the restaurant welcomed two groups of customers.The first batch was from the blond Sun Dongheng who came last time. This time, he drove a BMW Z4 and brought another great beauty over.From the looks of it, this brat should be an insane demon that was flirting with girls.\u201cGood afternoon, Boss.\u201d Sun Dongheng greeted passionately, he suddenly remembered that in this restaurant, the owner might not buy everything, he had to get rid of Mengmeng, so he quickly looked at Mengmeng, and smiled even more enthusiastically: \u201cGood afternoon Little Princess Mengmeng!\u201d\u201cHmph, alright.\u201d Mengmeng winked at Ming Che with her big eyes. The little princess still remembered how he made a ruckus in the dining hall.\u201cWow, what a cute northern nose.\u201d The beauty beside Sun Dongheng said in an exaggerated manner.\u201cOf course, the boss is amazing; his daughter is even better. Let\u2019s sit over here; the round table belongs to the boss and Mengmeng.\u201d Sun Dongheng brought the beauty to a small table at the side of the window and sat down.\u201cJust these three small tables are the place for customers?\u201d The beauty pursed her lips in disbelief.\u201cEn, it\u2019s good enough to have a meal. After you finish eating, you will know. Even if you eat while standing, there will still be people willing to eat.\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s Egg-Fried Rice entirely subdued Sun Dongheng; he looked like a loyal fan of Zhang Han.\u201cBoss, when are we going to cook?\u201d Sun Dongheng felt a little hungry, so he asked.Zhang Han looked at the time; it was only 11: 40, so he replied: \u201cWait a moment, I\u2019ll cook the rice first.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Sun Dongheng replied.This time, Zhang Han cooked less. Six cups of rice.When it was time to cook, Zhang Han started to mix the noodles.Mount New Moon\u2019s noodles and rice were also of the same standard. White rice was tasty and white bread were equally attractive.The steamed bread with good quality noodles was already very fragrant. If one bit the cooked food with aromatic and robust taste, then the Mount New Moon, the best white flour in the world, would have to conquer a large number of people.There were even more ways to make pasta \u2014 steamed buns, rolls, youtiao, buns, noodles, bread, cakes, and so on. There were too many things that could be done.However, today, at noon, Zhang Han didn\u2019t plan to steam the steamed bun. There was knowledge to steamed bun, and steamed bun needed noodles so that it might have a sour taste after a long time, and after adding a lot of alkaline noodles, it would turn yellow. It would also have a slightly chemical taste.Zhang Han had never studied it before, there was only one way that he could do it, and that was to make dumplings!When Zhang Han was young, he had wrapped dumplings with his parents many times. At that time, his father rolled out the dough wrappings, his mother was in charge of covering the dough wrappings, and Zhang Han would make small round dough wrappings at the side.After a few tries, Zhang Han remembered the entire process of wrapping the dumplings, although he had forgotten about the details. But after checking for a while, Zhang Han understood clearly.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - Making DumplingsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euAs they were talking, the restaurant welcomed another two groups of guests. The first group was two men. They entered the room and looked at them strangely, their hearts were shocked by the high membership price. The second group was a woman in her thirties, carrying a bag. Her expression was very calm, after entering the room, she sat at a table in the corner, and took out her phone to play with it.Not even two minutes after them, Liang Mengqi and the other two arrived as scheduled.\u201cAh!\u201d There\u2019s no space left! \u201d Entering the house, Liang Mengqi saw that there was no place left, so she looked at Zhang Han and asked: \u201cBoss, there\u2019s no space left, what should we do? \u201cOr else \u2026\u201dLiang Mengqi wanted to say, why don\u2019t we also sit at the dining table and eat?However, before she could finish speaking, Zhang Han had already answered: \u201cLet\u2019s wait.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Liang Mengqi\u2019s expression froze.\u201cSigh, then let\u2019s wait a bit. Next time, just come a little earlier.\u201d Yu Qingqing shook her head and sighed.\u201cI\u2019ll go discuss it.\u201d Liang Mengqi rolled her eyes, said something and then walked towards Zhang Han who was busy working in the kitchen.\u201cNoodle food? Boss, what\u2019s so delicious about cooking at noon? \u201d Liang Mengqi asked.\u201cDumplings.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cI want to eat too.\u201d Liang Mengqi\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cMm, you have your share.\u201d Zhang Han nodded.Since the membership system was introduced, then Zhang Han would have more dishes in the future. He did not doubt that these people would be picky about their food.For example, Yu Qingqing did not like eating the leek. It was easy to handle, but after tasting it, one would know that the Mount New Moon did not grow food that were picky.What? Allergy?Sorry, there was no allergy about the things that the Mount New Moon grew.In other words, everything that was grown in the Mount New Moon was the best to fit people\u2019s tastes.What a joke, under the nourishment of spirit water, spirit earth, and thunder yang tree, how could the things have grown to be simple?\u201cBoss, then \u2026 then where are we waiting? Why don\u2019t we sit at the dining table as well? Or the little table over here. \u201d Liang Mengqi pointed to the round table and chair to the right of the sofa.\u201cNo.\u201d Zhang Han immediately rejected her.If they were allowed to sit here, then there would be more and more members in the future. Could it be that everyone was sitting around in the house? Zhang Han would not allow that to happen.\u201cThen what should we do, boss \u2026\u201d Liang Mengqi\u2019s expression became bitter.If it were any other time, if it were anyone else who repeatedly rejected Liang Mengqi like this, she would have already exploded. Don\u2019t forget, Liang Mengqi was a purebred second-generation purebred!Even though she is gentle, she still has a temper. However, in this restaurant, no matter how rich, how temperamental, and how willful you are, you will always behave yourself, because if you aren\u2019t obedient \u2026 There was no food.Seeing that, Zhang Han muttered to himself, and Liang Mengqi felt that there was no chance for her to communicate with Zhang Han, so she looked at Mengmeng, and whispered in her heart:\u201cHumph!\u201d A mean boss! If you don\u2019t agree, someone else will! \u201dAfter a few days of interaction, Liang Mengqi and the others had found out about Zhang Han\u2019s lifeline!Rather than trying to please him, it was better to satisfy Mengmeng. If Mengmeng spoke up for her, the owner would not refuse!As if Zhang Han had noticed her gaze and thoughts, he swept his eyes over the dining room, pointed to the two long cabinets outside the kitchen, and said: \u201cThen you guys can throw those two cabinets out and go buy a few tables. Consider them your fixed seats as members.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Liang Mengqi slightly froze for a moment, then said happily: \u201cAlright, Qingqing, Sissy, come quickly.\u201dLiang Mengqi immediately waved her hands towards her two companions.\u201cHehehehe, it\u2019s done. Let\u2019s throw these two cabinets away, then go buy tables and chairs.\u201d Liang Mengqi said while laughing.\u201cSure thing.\u201d Zhao Dahu laughed, rolled up his sleeves and prepared to work.The cabinet was two large ones. One of them was about two meters long, and it was around forty centimeters wide. Zhao Kai made this cabinet according to what he thought; it was used to store some ancient treasures.However, before the antique had even been placed, the cabinet had already \u2018died\u2019.From the kitchen to the small dining table in front of the window, about four meters in total, it was more than enough to set down three dining tables.\u201cOne, two, three, use your strength!\u201d Yu Qingqing instructed.With a push, Yu Qingqing was lifted, but on the other side, Liang Mengqi and Zhao Dahu did not raise either.The strength of a man and a woman couldn\u2019t even be compared to Yu Qingqing alone. This couldn\u2019t help but cause Yu Qingqing to feel a little discouraged:\u201cYou two haven\u2019t eaten your fill?\u201d\u201cAiya, it\u2019s too heavy.\u201d Liang Mengqi pouted, she had clearly used all her strength, then looked at Zhao Dahu, and said snappily: \u201cCalling you sissy, you are a sissy, you don\u2019t have any strength left!\u201d\u201cHow could I do such menial work!\u201d Zhao Dahu said with a bit of grievance.\u201cA cough\u2026\u201d What are you doing? \u201d At this time, a low voice sounded from the door.Turning his head, he realized that it was the late Zhao Feng.Yu Qingqing knew that this brat had some skills, so she quickly said: \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there, quickly come and work.\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Zhao Feng looked at Zhang Han with some disbelief.\u201cCan\u2019t you see it\u2019s gone?\u201d Liang Mengqi answered: \u201cI was begging the boss for a long time before he agreed to leave this place for us so that we can set up our table.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Zhao Feng nodded, and said: \u201cLet me do it.\u201dZhao Feng walked in front of Liang Mengqi as he said that, with one hand grabbing the cabinet, he and Yu Qingqing lifted it up and slowly walked out.At this moment, the people sitting at the small table by the window all stood up.Sun Dongheng said: \u201cYou want to carry the cabinet, why didn\u2019t you say so earlier? Everyone should help out a little; we thought that you guys felt that the cabinet was slightly crooked and was adjusting its position.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, Sun Dongheng and the others brought out the other cabinet.He placed it beside the trash can, where the old man, who just happened to clean up, was nearby. After seeing this scene, his smiling mouth couldn\u2019t close. It seemed like another batch of goods had come, oh, he felt perfect will in Mengmeng\u2019s casual restaurant.\u201cLet\u2019s go and buy tables and chairs. We need to pick the better ones to demonstrate our VIP status!\u201d Liang Mengqi cheered as she urged Yu Qingqing.\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Zhao Feng looked at Liang Mengqi and smiled slightly.He had a good impression of this girl, but it seemed that Liang Mengqi was not interested in her at all.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Liang Mengqi curled her lips.Zhao Feng was speechless and didn\u2019t know what to answer.I am a member of the restaurant, let\u2019s go together. Zhao Dahu glanced at Zhao Feng and said: \u201cThen drive the car behind us and follow us.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhao Feng nodded.Thus, they quickly drove towards the nearby shopping mall.Twenty minutes later, they returned with three small gray rectangular tables, each for four people.The delivery man put down the table, Liang Mengqi and the other two sat at a table and waited silently.\u201cZhao Feng, come, sit by my side. Zhao Dahu passionately patted the empty chair beside him and said.\u201cMm. Alright.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled and nodded.Usually, he would not bother with such things, and would not care about such things. But this time, Zhao Feng agreed.The reason was simple; he liked to look at Liang Mengqi.The chair beside Zhao Dahu was also facing Liang Mengqi. Honestly speaking, Zhao Feng really wanted to touch Liang Mengqi from the bottom of his heart, and so he longed for a sense of love.But it seemed that Liang Mengqi didn\u2019t like him at all, and this made Zhao Feng wonder again and again if he had not taken good care of his outer appearance. He remembered that when he went out, the other girls from the gang all praised him because he was handsome!Soon, the fragrant Egg-Fried Rice was served.Zhang Han directly placed it on the counter, and the customer served their food.This time, Liang Mengqi cooked about half of the Egg-Fried Rice and ate a portion of Zhao Dahu and Zhao Feng.Because Liang Mengqi wanted to leave some food for the dumplings, and because Yu Qingqing didn\u2019t like leeks, it could even be said that she disliked leeks. Thus, she only planned to eat the Egg-Fried Rice.The others also began to serve their meals in succession. If one person were to serve their rice, they would not feel happy. However, since they were all obediently standing in line to serve their rice, everyone would think that it was nothing to them.\u201cLet\u2019s sit here too.\u201d Seeing that the table was getting higher, Sun Dongheng wanted to bring his new sister and sit.\u201cHey, hey, hey!\u201d Liang Mengqi quickly stopped them: \u201cThis is where the members sit. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s nowhere for you to go when you go back!\u201d\u201cEh \u2026\u201d Sun Dongheng\u2019s expression froze as he nodded and brought his female companion back to the small white dining table by the window.Zhao Feng smiled at Liang Mengqi, thinking that she was very interesting.\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d Liang Mengqi glared at him.\u201cUn\u2026\u201d I think you\u2019re brave. \u201d Zhao Feng nodded his head lightly.\u201cWhat does it have to do with you? \u201cEat your food.\u201d Liang Mengqi was not used to spoiling Zhaofeng at all, so Zhao Feng could not help but laugh bitterly to himself.He didn\u2019t have any ill intentions!The rice was still fragrant when they ate it, especially the few newcomers at the back. They did not look too good when they were eating it, and the praise was written all over their faces.As for Zhang Han, he boiled a pot of water and placed the panel on the round table.\u201cPapa, what are you doing?\u201d Mengmeng asked curiously.\u201cDaddy is going to make dumplings for you to eat.\u201d Zhang Han replied with a slight smile.\u201cUgh \u2026\u201d Then Mengmeng will help the Papa. \u201d Mengmeng said as she ran over and sat on the small chair and looked at Papa.Zhang Han placed some flour on the surface of the dough, as a precaution against the powder sticking to the mixture, splitting the dough into three pieces and transforming into three small dough. Then, he placed the two dough back into the basin.Zhang Han placed his finger in the center of the circle, and in a circle, he started to revolve it. Zhang Han\u2019s moderate strength pulled the loop, and gradually, the ring reached a certain degree of thickness, and when it was as thick as a thumb, Zhang Han cut it off.The next step was to use it to roll the dough wrappings. Zhang Han did not use his blade to cut the dough but used his hand to pull the dough directly.He needed to use even more strength to pull the dough; otherwise, the dough would be stretched out. Zhang Han\u2019s control of his energy could be said to be at the peak of perfection.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 - Only for MembersPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euThere were different types of flour, such as high, low, or medium gluten.Some were suitable for making dumplings and buns, some were suitable for making bread, and some were suitable for making noodles. Different categories were depending on how much the dough was cooked. Of course, there were also some such as snow pollen, dumplings\u2019 flour, bread flour, and so on.There were many types of flour, but the powder processed by the Mount New Moon was omnipotent.Zhang Han could control the degree of the flour according to the amount of water he poured into it, and do whatever he wanted to do. Furthermore, the noodles themselves were very fragrant, so the delicacies they cooked could be said to be unquestionable.\u201cPaPa, what \u2026 what should I do?\u201d Mengmeng watched from the side for a while, but she did not know what she was going to do.\u201cMengmeng can just press this small dough into a flat round shape.\u201d Zhang Han pointed to the dough.\u201cOh.\u201d Mengmeng obediently stretched out her hand and pressed down, \u201cIs that so? Ah, I can\u2019t take it down! What do we do, Papa. \u201dWhen Mengmeng\u2019s small hand pressed down, she immediately stuck the small dough onto her palm. Mengmeng raised her hand, looked at it for a while, then swung it up and down with force, but could not shake it off.\u201cHahaha \u2026\u201dZhang Han laughed heartily. He seemed to have seen this scene before as if he had also experienced such a view when he was young.\u201cHere, dad will get it for you.\u201d Zhang Han took off the dough in Mengmeng\u2019s hands and placed some flour on her hands. He said: \u201cWipe some flour, and it won\u2019t stick to your hands.\u201cUgh \u2026\u201d \u201cIs that so?\u201d Mengmeng successfully squashed a small piece of dough, then the little princess raised her head and looked at Zhang Han and said: \u201cPapa, how is Mengmeng\u2019s squashing?\u201d\u201cUn \u2026\u201d Zhang Han muttered to himself as he carefully looked at the small dough and said: \u201cIt\u2019s excellent to press. Mengmeng is so awesome, and it\u2019s really round and flat.\u201d\u201cHaha \u2026\u201d Mengmeng laughed happily as she continuously pressed down little dough, feeling that it was both fun and fun.\u201cPapa, look at this, round, Papa, look, it\u2019s so flat, Papa \u2026\u201dWhen Zhang Han saw this scene, at the same time as a happy smile leaked out from the corner of his mouth, the depths of his eyes also became somewhat absent-minded.As a father for the first time, he finally knew how his father felt as a child.At that time, he had pressed dough, and his father had looked at him with such a gentle gaze. Their family members happily packed dumplings, and the child\u2019s happy appearance. As a father, his heart was happy and satisfied.\u2018I wonder how mom and dad are doing now\u2026 \u2018\u2018After a year, no matter where you are, no matter what trouble you have, my son will come and fetch you.\u2019\u2018Family reunion, I\u2019ll let you all see your cute granddaughter\u2026 \u2018Zhang Han sighed softly in his heart.He was naturally anxious about his parents, but Zhang Han would never put this emotion on his face. Instead, he kept it buried deep in his heart. It was the same as Zi Yan\u2019s.Mengmeng pressed the dough very slowly. Every time she finished pressing the button, Zhang Han would roll the dough in two seconds and wrap the dumplings up in two seconds. The dumplings were round and plump, like a gold nugget.This caused Mengmeng to become a little anxious. While she increased her speed, she pouted and said:\u201cAiya, Papa, why don\u2019t you slow down a little \u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, alright, alright. Daddy will be a bit slower, how about you press the button with daddy?\u201d\u201cNo, I, I press \u2026\u201dDuring the interaction time between Zhang Han and Mengmeng, the dumplings had been appropriately wrapped. Because they were mainly made by Mengmeng, the dumpling was very exquisite and was a lot smaller than usual.Zhang Han took the panel and returned to the kitchen, just at this time, the water also boiled, and then the dumplings began to cook in the boiling water.Just then, Zhang Han cut the garlic into minced garlic and put it into a bowl. He added soy sauce and placed vinegar, fragrant oil and chili oil beside it.Zhang Han used two small plates to mix the dipping condiments, and very quickly, the dumplings were placed into a net basin, and Zhang Han put two plates on the table.\u201cMengmeng, it\u2019s time for us to eat.\u201d Zhang Han waved to Mengmeng who was on the sofa.\u201cCome, let\u2019s eat \u2026\u201d Mengmeng ran over happily.\u201cBoss\u2026\u201dJust as Liang Mengqi opened her mouth, he interrupted her: \u201cGo ahead and get them. There\u2019s no need to ask in the future; I\u2019ll leave some for you guys when I cook.\u201d\u201cHehehehe, boss, you\u2019re so nice. I love you.\u201d Hearing that, Liang Mengqi\u2019s face lit up and even said a few ambiguous words in front of everyone. After that, Liang Mengqi\u2019s face turned slightly red, and her heart started beating even faster.Yu Qingqing looked at Liang Mengqi strangely and laughed meaningfully.As for Zhao Feng, he was slightly stunned, and his heart stirred:Does she like the boss?Zhao Feng sighed in his heart, got up and followed along, preparing to eat a plate of dumplings. The boss\u2019s food was very fragrant, of course, he would not let go of any delicacies.In the face of Liang Mengqi\u2019s words, Zhang Han did not have any expression, but Mengmeng was a little displeased. She pouted her little mouth and said: \u201cNo, you cannot love my Papa.Mengmeng had already decided not to have anything with the little sister. Although she had played with him a few times, that still wasn\u2019t good.Hearing that, Liang Mengqi stuck out her tongue, then laughed: \u201cBig sister is joking.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201d Mengmeng snorted lightly and ignored her.Liang Mengqi did not mind as well and returned to the table happily with a plate of dumplings.\u201cEh? Qingqing, why don\u2019t you get some dumplings? \u201d Liang Mengqi asked curiously when she saw that Yu Qingqing did not get up.\u201cI\u2026 \u201cI don\u2019t like leeks very much.\u201d Yu Qingqing shook her head slightly.Not only did she not like it, but she was also very bored. She felt that the leek was a bit spicy, and it would even taste like leek in her mouth.\u201cThen forget it, I didn\u2019t have much left. I\u2019ll eat it all later.\u201d Liang Mengqi said as she complacently picked up a dumpling, dipped it in dipping condiments and placed it in the end.After eating, the dough was smooth. When you bit down on it, the fragrance of the leek and egg lingered in your mouth.What kind of feeling was this?The dumplings with the leek and egg stuffing already tasted very good. The leek and egg filling with the Mount New Moons tasted even purer.With the help of the fragrant wood, the taste of the ingredients was enhanced. This taste was so strong that Liang Mengqi was no longer able to use words to express it.\u201cHow could this be \u2026\u201d After Zhao Dahu ate a dumpling, his gaze became incredibly gentle, and he muttered softly: \u201cThis is the most delicious dumpling I\u2019ve ever eaten, the taste is delicious.\u201d\u201cTruly formidable.\u201d Even with Zhao Feng\u2019s personality that did not like to praise others, he could not help but exclaim in praise at this moment.Seeing the expressions of the three, Yu Qingqing\u2019s stomach violently rumbled twice.Even the speed of eating the Egg-Fried Rice on the plate slowed down. Eventually, they gradually stopped and stared eagerly at the three people who were eating happily.In her heart, she apparently did not like eating leek, but under the support of the three of them, she had thought that Zhang Han\u2019s food could not be measured by common sense.\u2018Perhaps, the boss\u2019s leek is the best in the world. That taste should\u2026 Very good, isn\u2019t it? \u2018Yu Qingqing\u2019s gaze swept across the three people\u2019s plates and then looked at their expressions. She intentionally coughed lightly and asked: \u201cMengqi, sissy, are the dumplings delicious?\u201d\u201cDelicious.\u201d Liang Mengqi replied vaguely while eating the dumplings.\u201cIt\u2019s too fragrant!\u201d Zhao Dahu replied.After they finished talking, the two continued eating the dumplings on the plate.\u2018It\u2019s over just like that? \u2018Yu Qingqing was slightly taken aback.She was still waiting for one of the two to say, \u201cQing Qing, why don\u2019t you try one of them?\u201dHowever, the reality was ruthless. The two of them only had eyes for the dumplings in front of them.Therefore, Yu Qingqing looked at Zhao Dahu with some anger.You still want to chase after me like this!? Humph! Just you wait! This bastard was completely unreasonable!\u201cI\u2019ll go and get it myself!\u201d Yu Qingqing said snappily as she stood up and walked towards the kitchen counter.Just as she took a step forward, Liang Mengqi\u2019s words came from behind: \u201cQing Qing, didn\u2019t you say that you don\u2019t like to eat leek? Just try two of them, and leave some for me.\u201dYu Qingqing\u2019s body shook, and she muttered angrily:\u201cLosing friends!\u201d What a bad friend! No loyalty, no sisterhood! This was the end of the line! Humph! I will bring it all out! \u201dIn a fit, Yu Qingqing placed all the dumplings that were worth about a minute and a half into her plate.After sitting back down, Yu Qingqing picked up a dumpling and looked at it.All the dumplings were a size smaller than usual. They looked like little ingots and looked pretty good.Without touching the dipping condiments, she directly took a bite.At that moment, Yu Qingqing\u2019s eyes slowly widened, and in the next moment, she activated her berserk mode and started to eat her dumplings frantically.At the same time, the bullet screen in her heart floated past once again:\u201cSo the dumplings made from leek and eggs are so delicious!\u201d\u201cNo, no, no. It should be said that the dishes made by the boss are the real leek, egg, and dumplings.\u201d\u201cWhat I\u2019ve eaten before is fake. It\u2019s all fake! It\u2019s all fake!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe several of them continued to savor their food, causing the customers sitting at the small white table by the window to raise their eyebrows.They also wanted to have a taste of the dumplings.The surprise that the Egg Fried Rice gave them was too strong.Especially for Sun Dongheng, he could not endure the temptation of the taste buds any longer. He turned his head to look at Zhang Han and said:\u201cBoss, that\u2026 I want dumplings too. \u201dAt this moment, the beautiful lady in front of him strangely said, \u201cIf you want to eat it, go and get it. I also want to try it. The Egg Fried Rice is so delicious, and the dumplings will definitely be fragrant.\u201dBut Zhang Han\u2019s answer made Sun Dongheng laughed bitterly:\u201cMembers can only eat it; nonmember only has Egg-Fried Rice and milk for now.\u201d\u201cEh \u2026\u201d Sun Dongheng\u2019s face stiffened as he shook his head helplessly.\u201cA member?\u201d At this time, the woman at the innermost area pondered for a moment and said, \u201cThen help me get a member. I also want to eat dumplings. How much is the member?\u201dWhen she arrived, she was playing with her cell phone, so she didn\u2019t notice the billboard in the front of the restaurant.\u201cOne million yuan.\u201d Zhang Han replied indifferently without even turning his head.\u201cOne million yuan? Are you sure it\u2019s not 100 yuan? \u201d The woman was stunned. She had never heard of a restaurant asking for a million membership cards.Liked it?

After that, each membership card will cost ten million.\u201d Yu Qingqing glanced at her, and said: \u201cFurthermore, all of the dumplings are sold, even if you buy a membership, you won\u2019t be able to eat them. The boss will not cook more for you.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d The woman chuckled and shook her head slightly. She didn\u2019t show any intention of mocking anyone, because she felt that the Egg Fried Rice here was really delicious. It was just that the membership card was a bit too expensive.The Egg Fried Rice could be said to be a luxury. The three hundred yuan was enough for two people to eat four dishes in other restaurants. Here, you would only get one serving of Egg Fried Rice.\u201cOh my god, a membership card cost a million, it\u2019s so expensive!\u201d The female at Sun Dongheng\u2019s side opened her mouth, looked to the side of Liang Mengqi, and said:\u201cSo all four of them are members here?\u201d\u201cSo rich, a million membership card, and they bought it without hesitation. So cool.\u201d\u201cThe Egg-Fried Rice is so delicious. The dumplings must be delicious too.\u201d\u201cOh no, this restaurant is so unique. It\u2019s a pity that only members can enjoy such delicious food.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe woman\u2019s heartless words, which Sun Dongheng heard, lingered in his heart.He liked to act cool, especially in front of the girl he was flirting with. If he showed off his strength, he could enjoy a night of romance.But at this moment, he felt that he was somewhat aggrieved.Bringing a girl here to eat delicious food, in the end the girl was amazed at the delicacy of the food and the heroic spirit of other people who bought a membership card. The only thing she forgot was that he was the one who brought her here, and he was the one who paid!\u201cOh god, how come I don\u2019t feel even a little bit of importance!\u201dSun Dongheng cried out in sorrow in his heart.At the same time, he felt that if he had a membership card in this restaurant, he would show it off all the time.Just imagine, everyone was speaking highly of the delicious Egg-Fried Rice. However, when they saw other delicacies and wanted to taste them, only members could!Sun Dongheng felt that if he had a membership here. This could be said to be the highest stage of prentending!Just imagine, as a member, he brought a girl here to eat a meal that only members could eat. Looking at the envious eyes of the others, \u2018Hiss!\u2019 Thinking about it, Sun Dongheng felt goosebumps all over his body.\u201cHow about\u2026 I applying for a membership card too? \u201dSuddenly, this thought rose up in Sun Dongheng\u2019s mind, this thought became more and more intense.\u201cBut I don\u2019t have that much money, what should I do\u2026 Right, how about \u2026 I calling my mom to come have a meal. She tasted the Egg Fried Rice and would definitely give me a membership card! \u201cHahaha, that\u2019s it. There\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be solved with a meal of Egg-Fried Rice!\u201dAn idea came to Sun Dongheng\u2019s mind, and his eyes faintly shone.On the other side of the table, three people were already grabbing dumplings to eat.Liang Mengqi realized that after putting all the dumplings on Yu Qingqing\u2019s plate, she did not care about her ladylike appearance and extended her chopsticks towards Yu Qingqing\u2019s plate.As for Zhao Dahu, he sneakily and carefully reached for the chopsticks.\u201cWhat are you doing!?\u201d \u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d Yu Qingqing hugged the plate in her arms, and said warily: \u201cDon\u2019t snatch it away, you are better than this! \u201cLet me tell you this, I finally had a meal of leek, you all are not allowed to snatch it!\u201d\u201cQing Qing, I\u2019m not full yet. Qing Qing, give me some \u2026\u201d Seeing that she could not snatch it, Liang Mengqi quickly pleaded her with her sweet voice.Her coquettish gaze really stunned Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes.The more they interacted with each other, the more he realized that Liang Mengqi was very close to the right girl he had in mind, very close. Perhaps, it couldn\u2019t be described as close, but it could also be said that she was the right girl.As for Yu Qingqing, she could not stand Liang Mengqi\u2019s coquettish actions, and said repeatedly: \u201cAlright, alright, alright, I\u2019ll give you some now, right?\u201dThus, she gave Liang Mengqi a third of the dumplings in her plate. Seeing Zhao Dahu who was looking forward to it, Yu Qingqing only gave him five of them.And this still made Zhao Dahu happy.After finishing their meal, Liang Mengqi and the others went to pay the bill.\u201cBoss, how much are the dumplings?\u201d Liang Mengqi asked with a smile.\u201cThe main course and food are all at the same price.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cOh, then that\u2019s three hundred for each.\u201d Liang Mengqi was slightly stunned, then she stuck out her tongue and said: \u201cI just remembered, we only ate the main course, the food the boss cooked was simply too delicious, it was love to death\u2026 \u201cHeeheehee \u2026\u201dLiang Mengqi originally wanted to say \u201cI love you to death\u201d, but just as she was about to speak, she saw the vigilant little princess looking at her.Mengmeng\u2019s clear eyes put her words to an end prematurely.\u201cThen I ate a serving of Egg-Fried Rice, eh\u2026 Two dumplings and two cups of milk, for a total of eleven thousand. \u201d Liang Mengqi paid the bill.Yu Qingqing, Zhao Dahu and Zhao Feng had also paid their own meals. Originally, Liang Mengqi and the other two had a good relationship with each other, so they could treat each other well.but after they had decided that they will come to eat in here frequently, the thought it would be better go dutch.\u201cOh yeah, the membership card is ready. I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201dWhen Liang Mengqi and the others were cleaning up the tableware, Zhang Han said this and took out the membership card from the drawer.\u201cI\u2019m Number One, I\u2019m Number One.\u201d Liang Mengqi hurriedly said.When she picked up the membership card, she was shocked and looked at it carefully.\u201cWow, the boss surely has spent some money. The words are inlaid with diamonds.\u201dWith just a glance, she could tell the material of the membership card. She was a high-end jewelry appraiser, and one of a very high quality at that.Liang Mengqi carefully placed the membership card into her purse. It was not because of the materials on the card, but rather because she knew with just a glance that the card cost was only around 40,000 to 60,000, and that the difficulty was due to the diamond inlay.She was very careful because this membership card made her feel that it was very precious!Not because of the price, but because it could let them enjoy the delicacies here.The other three people also got their treasurable card. Yu Qingqing was the second member, Zhao Dahu was the third and Zhao Feng was the fourth.They held their membership cards and were elated, but they never thought that in the near future, Mengmeng\u2019s casual restaurant would become the number one restaurant in the world. Every single membership card in the restaurant would be auctioned off at an astronomical price!Receiving the membership card, her heart was filled with joy, but Yu Qingqing was slightly stunned, and subconsciously asked: \u201cBoss, why is there no phone number on the membership card?\u201d\u201cWhat do you need a phone number for?\u201d Zhang Han shook his head slightly and said: \u201cthe business hours are settled. The restaurant will not accept reservations, so there is no need to leave the number.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s true.\u201d Yu Qingqing realised, and looked at Zhang Han with a complicated look.If it were any other restaurant, they would probably accept all kinds of reservations. However, in this restaurant, the cooking time was only that short.The boss acted as if he didn\u2019t care; However, everyone who came was convinced.When they were cleaning up their tableware, the woman opposite to Sun Dongheng shook her head and sighed: \u201cThe membership here is already this high class, wow, that\u2019s a real diamond, it\u2019s too beautiful, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen such a membership card.\u201d\u201cOh really?\u201d Sun Dongheng forced a smile and said: \u201cIt\u2019s really pretty nice to look at, really quite good \u2026\u201dSun Dongheng only wanted to eat the delicacies that only members could enjoy. yesterday was home-made dishes, today was the dumplings, no one knew what would be tomorrow.The exclamations of the girl on the other side was more like a type of aphrodisiac, making Sun Dongheng unable to endure it any longer. He wanted to quickly buy his membership card, thinking about what he should say when he returned home tonight.The customers left one after another, leaving behind a chorus of praises.Zhang Han did not count the money he had collected, but from the thickness of the stack of hundred dollar bills, he could tell that it was around seven to eight thousand.A few new customers left early, and another three people came in one after another and bought all the leftover Egg Fried Rice. Those who came after could only run out of food.Furthermore, from the looks of the people when they left, it was obvious that they had completely submitted to the Egg-Fried Rice. It seemed that the restaurant would soon become crowded.Sichuan restaurant in the next door.The manager in front of the door frowned as he watched the people leaving Zhang Han\u2019s Restaurant.\u201cwhy there are still customers when the food is that expensive?\u201d\u201cThose people seem to come for every meal, three times a day.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dThe manager could not understand the situation. If it was just 30 RMB for a serving of Egg Fried Rice, he could understand. However, if it was 300 RMB for a serving of Egg Fried Rice, with which people could even eat three decent dishes in his restaurant, and there are still people to eat the Egg Fried Rice.\u201cIs that meal really that special?\u201d Looking at their expressions, it seems like there are some tricks in it. 300 for each, I should go and try it out another day \u2026 \u201dThe manager muttered to himself.Zhang Han was originally playing with Mengmeng on the sofa, but when he got up, he realized that the dining room had already been cleaned up by Zhao Dahu and Zhao Feng.Zhang Han laughed slightly, people like the two who quietly helped Zhang Han with his work, in Zhang Han\u2019s eyes, was considered \u2018respectful\u2019. If someone help me, I would help them back more, which was why they were able to become more and more casual in the restaurant, and Zhang Han would not say anything.looking around the restaurant. Aside from the missing items, the photo frame on the wall had not been changed.There were six framed photographs on one side of the kitchen wall, and eight framed photographs on the direction of the piano.\u201cMengmeng, can we go take a picture in the afternoon?\u201d Zhang Han said with a smile.\u201cEh?\u201dMengmeng was startled, then after understanding the situation, she was very happy. She immediately put down the toy in her hands, raised her small hand and said: \u201cOkay okay, go take a photo.\u201dGirls were born with a love for beauty, of course Mengmeng was no exception. Furthermore, before she met Zhang Han, she was very, very, very beautiful.However, not long after she stayed with Zhang Han, the strong inpulse to poo broke the lady image, which Zi Yan had painstakingly educated for more than three years!According to Zhang Han\u2019s words, \u201cWhat kind of woman are you? My Han Yang Immortal\u2019s daughter, naturally has the aura of someone who can look down upon the world. \u201dZhang Han carried Mengmeng out to the photo studio in New Moon Bay.\u201cWelcome, sir.\u201d A waitress came over and greeted him with a smile, \u201cDo you want to take a family picture?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han nodded and said, \u201ci want fourteen photos, the frame is 600X800.\u201d\u201cAlright, Mister, let me introduce you to our service package \u2026\u201dThe woman wanted to introduce, but Zhang Han shook his head lightly and said: \u201cNo need to introduce. I want the best, the price doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Mister, please come over here. Please come to the second floor.\u201d Hearing that, the lady knew that a big client had come, and welcomed Zhang Han to the second floor with a warm smile.\u201cSir, your daughter is so beautiful. It would be better if her hair was tidied up.\u201d The lady looked at Mengmeng, and her eyes lit up.When Mengmeng was with him, he had always let her hair be the natural look. It was only when Zhang Han went to the beach that he gave Mengmeng a ponytail.Even so, Mengmeng\u2019s exquisite little face managed to control the unusual hairstyle.There are no ugly hairstyles in the world, only people who cannot handle their hairstyles. Some people, whether long or short hair, are very good-looking.Some people couldn\u2019t handle many hairstyles, such as curl, or straight hair. If they had a new hairstyle, they might not look like who they really are. It was like giving a bald man a wig, or something like that.As for Mengmeng, she had a good face and can handle all the hairstyles, it would make the staff of studio feel much more easier.\u201cOf course my daughter is beautiful. Look at her hairstyle.\u201d Zhang Han chuckled.Facing the praise, Mengmeng was naturally happy, she hummed a song in a low voice. In the afternoon, Mengmeng had changed her hairstyle quite a bit, and took ten solo pictures by herself.Some looked angry, some looked happy, some had cute pouting mouths, and some even had one eye closed while she made a golden fish mouth.The photographer even wanted Mengmeng to pretend that she was about to cry, because he loved art, and he was sure that thus pictures will blow people\u2019s mind.Thus, he brought up the idea.\u201chow to pretend that I\u2019m about to cry? \u201d Mengmeng blinked her large and clear eyes and asked curiously.And when Zhang Han heard this, he immediately glared and replied:\u201cWhat are you talking about, don\u2019t take that kind of pictures.\u201dThe cameraman\u2019s expression froze. He quickly forced a smile and started to take photos of Zhang Han and Mengmeng.There was a picture of Mengmeng riding on a neck. Mengmeng rode on top of the PaPa\u2019s neck, raising both of his hands, leaving behind a happy little face. As for Zhang Han, who was below her, he had a smile that anyone could see.Of course, there were also pictures of Mengmeng kissing PaPa, with his face close to hers, and Mengmeng nestling in his embrace and his big hands held her little hands, etc.After taking the picture, the cameraman added Zhang Han\u2019s WeChat and told him that he would develop the picture tonight and send it to the restaurant tomorrow morning.Zhang Han went downstairs to pay and then directly left. Before he left, the photographer was praising him:\u201cThe pictures of Sir and your daughter are the most beautiful and warmest photos I\u2019ve ever taken \u2026\u201dFacing the praises, Zhang Han only smiled lightly.Just as he got on the car, Zhang Han\u2019s phone started ringing. He took it out and saw that it was Zhang Li who called.\u201cBro, your restaurant is open for business, right? How about it? did u attract any customer just by your poor cooking skills? \u201d Zhang Li joked.\u201cHuh?\u201d What? And you even started to make fun of your brother? \u201d Zhang Han laughed and replied.Zhang Han liked the jokes of relatives a lot, and only when he was with his family did he feel that he was a normal people, not a Han Yang Immortal.Family affection is not something that can be changed by differences in social class.\u201cI\u2019m not teasing you. I know how you cook. Remember, on my fifteenth birthday, you cooked once. What happened?\u201d Zhang Li said with a smile.\u201cIn the end, we all had diarrhea for an entire day, and in the end, you even went to complain to our mother that our big brother wanted to murder you.\u201d Zhang Han said with a smile.In his mind, he recalled the scene from that day.At that time, Zhang Li was fifteen, and he was eighteen. Although he had played very well in the Shang Jing, and was young and frivolous, looking down on others, he still felt very cherish his own little sister. On Zhang Li\u2019s birthday, Zhang Han wanted to give her a special present.Thus, after thinking about it, he decided to make a \u2018big meal\u2019 himself. As a result, everyone knew that this big meal was like a laxative.From then on, Zhang Li would call Zhang Han the \u2018Kitchen Assassin\u2019!If Liang Mengqi and the others knew about this, they would probably be greatly shocked.\u201cHumph!\u201d Zhang Li snorted and said: \u201cI thought you had forgotten. I will be on vacation the day after tomorrow, I\u2019m going to take a look at your place.\u201d\u201cMmm, this time, I\u2019ll let you experience my true culinary skills.\u201d Zhang Han smiled slightly.Most likely, after Zhang Li ate his own food, she would not be willing to leave.it was maybe for the best, because the job that being a DJ in a night club was still rather difficult for her. The important thing was, that kind of place was filled with all kinds of people, and no matter what, Zhang Li was still a slim and graceful beauty, and it didn\u2019t take a thought to think that there would be some bad people who would harass her.Instead of that job, why not stay in my own restaurant and serve a meal or something?At this time, Zhang Han was already preparing for Zhang Li\u2019s arrival, so the prepared food was a bit more sumptuous, making her to stay and work here.Zhang Li laughed after hearing this, and then spoke a few words with Zhang Han before hanging up the phone.\u201cPaPa is\u2026 Is Auntie coming to be a guest? \u201d Mengmeng who was seated in the back row asked with a little curiosity.\u201cYes, your aunt will come the day after tomorrow.\u201d Zhang Han nodded.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d That Mama will be back the day after tomorrow! PaPa, don\u2019t we still have to go to the big bird\u2019s place to pick up Mama? \u201d Mengmeng reminded him with her young voice.\u201cYour mother won\u2019t be here until ten in the evening. We can drive there by nine o\u2019clock. Your aunt should be here by day.\u201d Zhang Han said.\u201cOh.\u201d Mengmeng answered crisply, her large eyes blinking without anyone knowing what she was thinking. Finally, after five minutes, Mengmeng said in a baby voice, \u201cPaPa, mm \u2026 That older sister Kiki said she loved you today. \u201d\u201cShe was joking.\u201d Zhang Han could not help but laughing.\u201cThat, that\u2026 Ugh \u2026 \u201cNo, only Mama can love PaPa, others can\u2019t \u2026\u201d Although Mengmeng didn\u2019t understand love, she understood that PaPa and Mama loved each other.\u201cYour mother, she \u2026\u201d Zhang Han smiled and shook his head. He muttered to himself for a while, then replied: \u201cMengmeng, dad has you, there\u2019s no need to worry.\u201d\u201cUn humph, PaPa, Mama, Mengmeng, we will be together, Forever, um \u2026\u201d Never separate \u201cWe will never separate,\u201d Mengmeng said in her childish voice filled with determination and expectation.\u201cYes, Forever.\u201d Zhang Han solemnly nodded his head.Aside from Zi Yan, Mengmeng would definitely be with him forever. A hundred years, a thousand years, ten thousand years \u2026 Forever.\u201cHow about \u2026 \u2026\u201d For Mengmeng\u2019s sake, get the child\u2019s mother to fall in love with him first? \u201dZhang Han thought about it in his mind.\u201cIt\u2019s better not to overdo it, just let it develop naturally\u201dabout relationship, Zhang Han didn\u2019t like to interfere it. Just like how he liked to live a quality life, he enjoyed this kind of spiritual pursuit.Loving Mengmeng was real, but it was not love with Zi Yan yet. Furthermore, Zi Yan did not know how she felt about him, as the time they had spent together was too short.On the other hand, the past few days of chatting had brought the two of them closer to each other. Sometimes, they would even chat about interesting things.From a friend to a lover, this process was a very important memory in a person\u2019s life.Furthermore, Zhang Han subconsciously felt that it wouldn\u2019t be long before Zi Yan would fall in love with him.Returning back to the dining hall, Zhang Han gave Mengmeng a bath in the afternoon.Mengmeng sat in the bathtub full of bubbles. She was very happy as her little hands continuously waved the bubbles, and her childish voice hummed a song.\u201cOh, oh, oh, I love bathing\u2026 \u201cMy skin is fine, oh, oh, oh, I love bathing my skin. Oh, oh, oh, oh, I love bathing \u2026\u201dThe Little Princess only remembered this one sentence, but with just that one sentence, Mengmeng had been singing all the time, causing Zhang Han to laugh involuntarily.Although the song hummed intermittently, Mengmeng\u2019s voice had inherited Zi Yan\u2019s bloodline, and was somewhat childish, but the sound of her voice was still very attractive and enchanting.Soon, it was half past five.Although the opening hours were written at 18.00-19.00, it seemed that some people already knew that there was no place to sit later. Thus, at 5.30 p.m., six customers came one after another.Amongst the six people, one of them was someone Zhang Han had met once before when he was with Zhao Dahu this noon.Apparently, he was subdued by the Egg Fried Rice and had pulled his friends over to have a taste.At this time, Zhang Han also started to cook the rice, and before long, Sun Donghen walked in alone.This time he didn\u2019t bring a girl because he felt that he wasn\u2019t a member yet, so not only could he not act cool when bringing a beauty over, it even made it seem like young master Sun didn\u2019t have any money. So he planned to not bring any women over until he bought the membership card.\u201cno seat available?\u201d Sun Dongheng saw that there were already six people sitting at the three tables. He was slightly startled and turned to look at Zhang Han, asking:\u201cExcuse me, this place is full. Can I sit there?\u201dWhile talking, Sun Dongheng pointed to the member seats that Liang Mengqi and the others had bought.\u201cNo.\u201d Zhang Han replied indifferently.Sun Dongheng laughed bitterly and sighed as he stood to the side of the table and waited in line.Sun Dongheng was originally a comes from a rich family, and his temper was also not good. Typically, he loved to act cool, but in this Zhang Han\u2019s restaurant, he really didn\u2019t have a temper.The owner really had a unique personality and treated the customers with a bad attitude.Let the customers serve their own food, and only the members can taste the tasty dishes! Furthermore, he never got changes back when he paid them the money!The first two times, Sun Dongheng gave him money, he waited for two seconds, but after seeing Zhang Han casually putting the money in the drawer and walking away, he finally understood that the boss did not plan on giving changes!However, he didn\u2019t really care about the money. After all, the Egg-Fried Rice here was the best in the world.Putting aside the matter of the money, he was still a frequent customer and a loyal fan! but he still couldn\u2019t even sit on a member\u2019s seat and eat a meal!\u201cThe membership card here!\u201d I must have it! \u2018Sun Dongheng clenched his teeth as he thought resolutely in his heart.Liked it?

    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 - Start QueuingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euAfter Sun Dongheng stood there for a few minutes, three customers came into the restaurant\u201cHey, hey, hey!\u201d Where to go? It\u2019s a place where only members can sit. If you want to eat, line up behind me. \u201d Sun Dongheng immediately waved his hand towards the three of them.\u201cAren\u2019t there only four members? There are three tables over there, only one table had been taken, there are still two empty tables.\u201d One of them said hesitantly.\u201cEven if it\u2019s empty, it\u2019s not some seats that nonmember can sit on. Don\u2019t you see that I\u2019m standing here?\u201d Sun Dongheng said unhappily.\u201cOh.\u201d The man nodded his head slightly and stood behind Sun Dongheng.He had come to eat before, but his friends had never eaten here before. One of the slightly plump man frowned and said,\u201cThere are only three tables for ordinary customers? Isn\u2019t that a bit too exaggerated? Brother Liu, I think this place is average. Are you exaggerating? \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to that specialty soy sauce bone house and have a meal there?\u201d\u201cWhy would I lie to you?\u201d The man answered, \u201cLet me tell you, if you don\u2019t eat the Egg Fried Rice here, you will regret it for the rest of your life.\u201d\u201cThis is too exaggerated. What\u2019s the point in eating Egg-Fried Rice?\u201d His companion sneered. There was a trace of disdain in his words.\u201cHur hur.\u201d Sun Dongheng turned around and laughed coldly, \u201cI had the same idea as you in the past, but what happened then? Didn\u2019t I finally submit? \u201cLet me tell you, eating the Egg-Fried Rice here is a great blessing. If you don\u2019t want to eat it, you can leave. I don\u2019t want to hear the voices behind my back.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s eat.\u201d The three of them smiled awkwardly.After the three of them, there were another seven or eight customers who came one after another. They all crowded at the entrance of the restaurant and waited in line.\u201cEh? So many people? \u201dLiang Mengqi and the other two squeezed in from the entrance, feeling that the popularity of the restaurant was going a little too fast.It had only been a few days since the opening and people were already queuing up. After they finished their meal, there would probably be more people waiting to get into the restaurant to eat!However, they also felt that all of this was reasonable.With such a delicious Egg Fried Rice, not a single foodie could resist it. one could tell just by looking at the three of them, because all three of their meals were here.Under everyone\u2019s envious gaze, Liang Mengqi and the other two sat on the member seats.Liang Mengqi originally wanted to go greet and chat with Zhang Han, but when she turned her head to look, she saw that Zhang Han was busy in the kitchen, and Mengmeng was concentrating on watching the scene on the screen.A few minutes later, Zhao Feng arrived.He slightly nodded to the few people seated to the side of Liang Mengqi.\u201cZhao Feng, why are you sitting opposite me again?\u201d Liang Mengqi rolled her eyes and muttered.\u201cEh \u2026\u201d The corner of Zhao Feng\u2019s mouth twitched a few times.\u201cAh, Mengqi, why are you not friendly at all?\u201d Zhao Dahu curled his lips and joked: \u201cZhao feng is still a handsome guy after all, and you\u2019re not young either, aren\u2019t you going to think about it?\u201d\u201chum.\u201d Liang Mengqi pouted and said: \u201cIf I want to like someone, I would like the boss, not him.\u201d\u201cDo you like the boss?\u201d Zhao Feng smiled and said.\u201cWhy do you care who I like?\u201d Liang Mengqi said snappily: \u201cAren\u2019t you a busybody of some kind of gang? Why aren\u2019t you collecting the rent? Three meals a da here, why are you so free? \u201dZhao Feng heard and paused. A look of helplessness flashed past his eyes as he said solemnly: \u201cI don\u2019t like that kind of behavior either, but I\u2019m just a subordinate, not the boss.\u201dHe was not the boss, so he couldn\u2019t manage his subordinates, and he couldn\u2019t stop this kind of thing. This was a kind of helplessness, but once he dealt with Tang Zhan and became the gang leader, it would be time for him to properly clean up the gang.However, he would definitely not say such a thing. Even if he somewhat liked Liang Mengqi, he would not explain it to her.\u201cHmph, what\u2019s so good about being in a gang? You really went astray. even if you got a pretty face, who knows if you\u2019re a bad person.\u201d Liang Mengqi snorted.\u201cI \u2026\u201d Zhao Feng was truly speechless.Fortunately, at this time, Zhang Han said from the kitchen: \u201cThe food is ready.\u201dLiang Mengqi immediately stood up and walked away with a smile.However, the moment Zhao Feng stood up, he realized that Zhang Han\u2019s gaze was fixated on the people lining up at the entrance.After Zhao Feng saw this, he muttered to himself for a bit. He did not first serve the food, but turned around and walked to the door and said to the other people: \u201cDon\u2019t stay here, line up outside, the table is right here. If anyone leaves, you can enter.\u201dThe moment Zhao Feng opened his mouth, Sun Dongheng hurriedly stood up.\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Let\u2019s go out and queue up. Come, let\u2019s do it according to the ranking just now. No one is allowed to cut in line.\u201dRegardless of whether they were satisfied or not, the dozen of people all walked out and lined up at the entrance. However, there were two people who were dissatisfied and directly left.Zhao Feng thought about it, then got on the car to the supermarket to buy some chairs.\u201cWhat the heck? You have to queue up for just to eat Egg-Fried Rice.\u201d\u201cLittle Hu, if the Egg-Fried Rice is not as delicious as you say, let me tell you, we will not be friends!\u201d I\u2019ve been in the Xiang Jiang for three years, but have never come across such treatment while eating. \u201dWho was that person? he is not the boss and giving orders already? \u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, the boss didn\u2019t even say anything, and now he\u2019s trying to be in charge.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by gesticulating?\u201d Sun Dongheng raised his eyebrows, looked at the few men who spoke, and smirked: \u201cDo you guys think that he doesn\u2019t have the qualifications to command all of you? Heh, I don\u2019t mind telling you guys, he\u2019s Brother Feng of the Yonghe Society. Besides the gang leader, he\u2019s the strongest! \u201d\u201cIf Brother Feng heard this, you guys wouldn\u2019t be able to escape!\u201d Sun Dongheng saw that the faces of the few people had changed, he slightly raised his head, and said with a bit of satisfaction: \u201cMoreover, he\u2019s my big brother! Let me tell you, even my big brother has to behave himself in this restaurant.\u201cYes, yes, yes, you are right.\u201d\u201cAh, I didn\u2019t expect that little brother is from Yonghe Society.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re just chatting, it means nothing.\u201dThe few of them hurried to compliment Sun Dongheng.Sun Dongheng snorted and ignored them, and returned with his car five minutes later.He took out about thirty small chairs from the trunk.After knowing Zhao Feng\u2019s identity, Sun Dongheng took the lead, and everyone followed. They helped place the chairs neatly in front of the window on the left side of the dining hall.After they were done, they sat down in an orderly manner and started chatting, while Zhao Feng entered the dining hall to prepare for dinner.\u201cAh, I couldn\u2019t tell, but you do have a bit of good intentions.\u201d Liang Mengqi said in a strange tone.\u201cI like it here.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled slightly.It had to be said that his unintentional actions had caused Liang Mengqi to have some changes in her opinion of him.In fact, if Zhao Feng didn\u2019t do these, Zhang Han would say it too.This restaurant only existed because of Mengmeng, of course Zhang Han would not allow the restaurant\u2019s atmosphere to become chaotic, but if Zhang Han invited everyone out, he would not prepare chairs for them.This scene was also seen by the people from the spicy restaurant next door.\u201cIt can\u2019t be? That restaurant actually queued up? \u201d\u201cAre these people fool? \u201cThat\u2019s three hundred yuan worth of rice. A portion of rice can eat four dishes here.\u201d\u201cCrazy, truly crazy.\u201d\u201cLittle Mei, go take a look at the situation.\u201d The manager said with a slight frown.\u201cAlright.\u201dXiao Mei was the woman who went to Zhang Han\u2019s Restaurant to ask for the price previously. When she walked out of the restaurant with a nod, she asked curiously:\u201cWhy are you guys sitting here?\u201d\u201cLine up for dinner.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d one of them said.\u201cThis \u2026\u201d Xiaomei grinned and said, \u201cHis restaurant\u2019s food is so expensive, why are you all still queuing up to eat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s delicious. The food is worth it. Of course we have to eat it.\u201d\u201c300 yuan is worth it?\u201d Little Mei stared with her eyes wide open.\u201chuh!\u201d A man who had just finished eating sneered and said, \u201cLet me put it this way, even if the boss sells three thousand yuan of food, there will still be a lot of people queuing up to eat it. The boss is kind and wants to benefit everyone by selling three hundred yuan.\u201cthat impressive?\u201d This time, Lil Mei was completely stunned.This time no one answered her.Xiaomei pondered for a moment, and said tentatively, \u201cErm\u2026 Our restaurant still has a lot of places. Do you want to have a taste of Sichuan cuisine? \u201cNot just Sichuan Cuisine, but also some snacks. tasty but not expensive, it\u2019s worth experiencing!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Sun Dongheng put down his phone, his eyes staring straight at her: \u201cWhat? You\u2019re here to snatch the guests? \u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m just looking at how tired you are standing in line.\u201d Lil Mei smiled awkwardly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019re not tired. We have plenty of time to wait after work.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anymore. We definitely have to eat Egg Fried Rice.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. no matter what you are going to say, even if you were to place a delicacy before me, I would not even spare a glance. I will only eat the Egg-Fried Rice.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWith just a few words, Xiaomei returned to the restaurant in a slightly embarrassed state.In less than two minutes, Xiaomei came out again. This time, she was standing in front of the entrance of the restaurant as she shouted,\u201cSichuan Spicy Cuisine. It\u2019s not expensive to eat. Quickly come and have a taste. There are all kinds of snacks and pretty good Egg-Fried Rice. It\u2019s only 18 yuan, it\u2019s only 18 yuan \u2026\u201dAfter shouting for ten minutes, the manager saw the people lining up and frowned.What was going on?What was going on?Could it be \u2026 Was the Egg Fried Rice in the next restaurant really that delicious? No one came even after shouting that?No, there must be a problem. I have to go and have a taste tomorrow.The manager made up his mind.In Zhang Han\u2019s dining hall, because there were quite a few people queuing up, the customers eating at the small white table did not rest for too long. Most of them only ate, sat for two minutes, then paid and left.After all, everyone understood each other when they went out to eat. It was like when someone forgot to bring a cigarette from a shopping mall and asked others for one. Many smokers had this kind of experience before.After Zhang Han and Mengmeng finished their meal, they would play two piano pieces on a daily basis.The melodious melody of the song was very attractive.After playing the song, Mengmeng went to watch TV. At this time, most of the people in the line had already eaten their meal, and two of them had already sold out, sighing and leaving. On the other hand, Zhao Feng, after everyone had left, enthusiastically cleaned up the dining hall.\u201cBoss, do you have any wine?\u201d Zhao Feng sat at the white table beside the window and asked.Liked it?

    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - Zhao Feng was convinced.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat do you want to drink?\u201d Zhang Han smiled and said as he opened the fridge.The freezer was full of all kinds of beer and a few drinks.Zhang Han did not plan to drink any drinks, he only placed it casually on the table, but drinking some beer sometimes would be quite interesting.\u201cWhatever.\u201d Zhao Feng replied with a smile.As a result, Zhang Han directly took out four cans of beer, all of which were large bottles. He turned around and glanced at Mengmeng, the Little Princess was enjoying watching the cartoons with relish,so Zhang Han could be free.Carrying the beer, they sat down and listened to each other.\u201cWhat is it? Is there something on your mind? \u201d Zhang Han drank a mouthful of beer and said.\u201cI guess so \u2026\u201dZhao Feng shook his head slightly, his gaze filled with bitterness.Late last night, he found out that a fisherman found a corpse at the edge of the Southern District\u2019s seaside. After the official confirmation, the dead person was the little girl that Tang Zhan kept and was also a beauty that Zhao Feng took the risk to hook up with.Zhao Feng had plotted for half a year and when he was about to obtain the evidence, he failed.Tang Zhan was on guard against him, but it would be extremely difficult for Zhao Feng to do anything.\u201cBoss, I really envy you.\u201d Zhao Feng slightly smiled, and said: \u201cIt\u2019s really great that you have such a good daughter, and a warm life like this.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t envy me.\u201d Zhang Han said indifferently: \u201cIf this is the case, you will only get more and more envious in the future.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Zhao Feng was startled, then he laughed involuntarily. He took a big gulp of wine and said: \u201cSatisfying, a man should drink a lot.\u201d\u201cBoss.\u201d After Zhao Feng finished speaking, he looked at Zhang Han with a hint of respect: \u201cYou are an expert, whether it is with the blade or the energy in your body, I can feel it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han nodded.\u201cAt first, I thought my martial arts were quite decent. However, after meeting the boss, I felt that if I were to exchange blows with you, I would not be able to last for more than a minute.\u201d Zhao Feng slowly said.\u201cA minute? Too long, if I want to deal with you \u2026\u201d Zhang Han grinned: \u201cOne move.\u201dAlthough Zhang Han was only at the early stage of Qi Cultivating Stage, his body could easily move up to a thousand catties or more. Once he reached the Foundation Stage, he could release his spirit energy outwards,he can hurt a people easily with only a finger.On the other hand, Zhao Feng\u2019s expression paused for a moment after hearing his words, as if he was unconvinced.He had been a soldier for many years, and naturally he had a temper. In the army, he was relatively simple and crude. If you could beat me, then I submit.Zhang Han\u2019s words made Zhao Feng feel that he was underestimating him, and he was even a little displeased in his heart.Seeing his expression, Zhang Han knew what he was thinking. With a light laugh, he extended his hand towards Zhao Feng and said: \u201cTry it?\u201d\u201cCome!\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s eyes flashed and he reached out his right hand to grasp Zhang Han\u2019s hand.When Zhao Feng held it up, he first used thirty percent of his strength.Because he was afraid that he would hurt Zhang Han\u2019s hand, when he held it closely, he discovered that Zhang Han\u2019s hand was like an iron pincer, hard and unmoving.\u2018Interesting! \u2018A hint of seriousness surfaced in Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes. When his strength increased to 50%, he discovered that the boss\u2019s hand was still the same as before.\u2018Hm? \u2018Zhao Feng raised his eyebrows, a little peculiar in his heart.\u201cBoss, I\u2019m going to use my full strength.\u201dSeeing Zhang Han nodding his head slightly, Zhao Feng gradually increased his own strength.60% strength, 70% strength, 90% strength, 100% strength.Zhao Feng tried his best to clench it, but the boss\u2019s hand still didn\u2019t move an inch. It was only when Zhao Feng\u2019s face turned slightly red that he realized that he had underestimated the boss!\u201cHow is this possible?\u201dZhao Feng said in an astonished tone.He know that even his former captain didn\u2019t have such strength! Although Zhao Feng had used all of his strength to shake hands, boss\u2019s expression did not change. Zhao Feng still could not think of anyone who could do this.\u201cNothing is impossible.\u201d Zhang Han shook his head indifferently, using a bit of power for the first time in his palm.\u201cHiss \u2026\u201dIn that moment, Zhao Feng felt that his hand was struck by a force that he could not resist, a force that was like a thunderbolt, causing his heart to tremble.\u201cI submit, I surrender \u2026\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s face paled. He felt that his boss was holding onto him, worrying that his hand would be crippled, so he hurriedly opened his mouth to plead for mercy.Seeing that, Zhang Han immediately let go of his hand, turned and looked at Mengmeng, then laughed, picked up his beer and drank another mouthful.At this time, Zhao Feng was already looking at Zhang Han with a stupefied face.He placed his hands under the table, feeling numb and senseless. After resting for two minutes, he took a deep breath, and with both hands holding onto a can of beer, he sai to Zhang Han:\u201cBoss, I\u2019m really convinced. You\u2019re really unfathomable and powerful.\u201dZhang Han did not say anything as he clinked wine with him.\u201cBoss, you \u2026What were you once like? Is it convenient to say?\u201d Zhao Feng asked carefully.\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine what I do.\u201d Zhang Han smiled slightly.However, Zhang Han\u2019s next sentence made Zhao Feng\u2019s hair stand on end.\u201cYou used to be a soldier?\u201d Zhang Han said as he drank.Zhao Feng\u2019s expression changed as he looked at Zhang Han with shock. For a moment, he simply did not know how to reply.Zhao Feng pondered for a moment, and finally laughed bitterly while shaking his head, and said: \u201cBoss, how did you figure it out?\u201d\u201cNothing can escape my nose\u2026My eyes.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cThis\u2026 Sigh\u2026\u201d Zhao Feng laughed bitterly for a long time, and finally sighed, directly finishing the beer, and then sighed: \u201cI was a member of the Dragon Eagle\u2019s special forces back then, and was ranked in the top three in my individual combat skills. At that time, there was a brother who went on a mission, and he \u2026\u201dZhao Feng had always kept those memories in his heart, and now that he had opened the chatterbox, he started talking nonstop.\u201cBoss, I don\u2019t regret the attack at all. If it was you, what would you do?\u201d Zhao Feng sighed lightly.He felt that the boss was very powerful and was a person who hid his abilities well. Such an expert, in the face of such a situation, would probably retaliate even more fiercely.However, Zhang Han\u2019s reply almost made him bite his tongue.Zhang Han said very straightforwardly: \u201cI won\u2019t encounter that kind of situation.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Zhao Feng was a little confused.These words were of course the truth for Zhang Han. Who was he? There were countless treasures in the Han Yang Immortal. If he was Zhang Han\u2019s brother, then he would also have many defensive treasures.\u201cAlright \u2026\u201d Zhao Feng didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry as he nodded his head, sighing in his heart that the expert\u2019s way of speaking was so high.At the same time, he continued, \u201cAfter that, I was locked up. Two years later, my old boss found me. He said it was to give me a mission, but it was actually to help me get out of the prison. But I also have to do something for him \u2026\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re a spy?\u201d Zhang Han laughed and said.\u201cUndercover \u2026 \u201cYes.\u201d Zhao Feng nodded, and said with a heavy tone: \u201cYonghe Society\u2019s boss, Tang Zhan, has committed all sorts of crimes, and in recent years, his methods of doing things have become more and more cruel, so \u2026\u201dIn the face of Zhang Han, Zhao Feng revealed the heaviest secret in his heart. He had suppressed it for too long, and he was also very tired.\u201cPaPa, PaPa\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Mengmeng called out.\u201cHe\u2019s coming.\u201d\u201cWhiz!\u201dZhang Han immediately stood up and turned to leave without any hesitation.Zhao Feng was stunned once again. He looked eagerly at Zhang Han\u2019s back, and stretched out his hand towards Zhang Han, as if wanting to call him over.He finally wanted to have a good chat and reveal the secret at the bottom of his heart, but the boss seemed to have no interest in his words.Boss, can you not be so heartless \u2026Zhao Feng almost couldn\u2019t catch his breath.\u201cHe\u2019s the most cherished father I\u2019ve ever seen, not one of them.\u201dThe corner of Zhao Feng\u2019s mouth twitched a few times as he muttered to himself.After finishing the last mouthful of beer, Zhao Feng saw that the boss and his daughter were playing around on the sofa. He did not disturb them and quietly left the restaurant.When he walked out of the restaurant, Zhao Feng laughed loudly. He felt that after chatting with the owner for a while, his suppressed heart had finally been relieved.\u2026\u2026Sun Dongheng\u2019s family owned a software development company.His father, Sun Ming, was a talented student in the past. After working in a large company for ten years, he started his own business and had been developing steadily.Sun Dongheng was brought up by his mother, so his relationship with her was slightly better. Every time, he would ask his mother for money.When Sun Dongheng grew up, his mother bought him an eighty square meter house, preparing to use it when he got married in the future.That night, Sun Dongheng returned home.\u201cYou\u2019re back. Have you had dinner? Mother made a boiled fish and came to try it. \u201d Sun Dongheng\u2019s mother said with a smile.\u201cNo, Mom, I\u2019ve already eaten.\u201d Sun Dongheng curled his lips. It would be bad if he ate Zhang Han\u2019s Egg-Fried Rice.How am I going to eat my mom\u2019s cooking in the future \u2026\u201cBrat, you\u2019re back? You haven\u2019t eaten, so why don\u2019t you come and sit for a while! \u201d Sun Ming said.After Sun Dongheng sat properly, Sun Ming frowned and spoke in a sullen tone: \u201cLook at your golden hair, you have been showing off for quite a while, can\u2019t you be more orderly? You only knows how to stir up trouble in the outside world every single day!\u201dSun Dongheng was so angry that he turned his head around.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy for the child to come back. Speak less.\u201d Sun Dongheng\u2019s mother said to Sun Ming with a hint of rebuke.\u201cSpeak less. If he\u2019s okay with it, I don\u2019t mind!\u201d Sun Ming said with a slightly disappointed tone, \u201cHe was halfway into university when he was withdrawn because of causing trouble. It\u2019s a disgrace! Now you are still fooling around outside all day, Sun Dongheng, I want to see if you can do anything successful! \u201d\u201cWhen did I mess around?\u201d Sun Dongheng could not hold back the anger in his heart, and said loudly: \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you everything about my fight at school? It\u2019s not my fault! \u201d\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t your fault, why did they fire you? Hmm?\u201d Sun Ming slammed his chopsticks on the table.Liked it?

    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 - For membership cardPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTwo months ago, Sun Dongheng was about to graduate from university, and he was expelled because of the fight,which made Sun Ming very angry. For this matter, Sun Ming often scolded Sun Dongheng,and he had even tried to find a lot of ways to help his son get bac to university but to no avail.\u201cIsn\u2019t it because the father of the brat that got beaten up is the school director?As a man, he wouldn\u2019t tolerate bullying my girlfriend! \u201d Sun Dongheng argued.\u201cGirlfriend, girlfriend, how many girlfriends have you had? Can\u2019t you have an ambition? How old are you? What do you know now? What can you do in the future? What can you do? \u201d Sun Ming said angrily.His career developed well, but there was only one son in his family, so he hoped that Sun Dongheng could inherit his career. But this brat didn\u2019t study well in university, he fooled around with society all day long, making Sun Ming disappointed and angry.\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business what I do!\u201d Sun Dongheng clenched his teeth and turned his head, his tone harsh: \u201cMom, I want money, eight hundred thousand.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need me but ask me for money?\u201d Sun Ming slammed the table heavily.\u201cI ask my mom for money, not you! Did I ever ask you for money? \u201d Sun Dongheng was enraged, he stood up and answered angrily.\u201cDidn\u2019t I make the money in the family? What did I make money for? In order to support the family, in order to let you stand out, what kind of bear do you think you are? If you have no future, you would only spend money everyday and spend lavishly. Do you think that it is easy to earn money now?\u201d Sun Ming said angrily.\u201cI don\u2019t need you to care! If you don\u2019t want to give it to me, so be it! \u201d Sun Dongheng kicked the chair behind him to the side and angrily walked out.\u201cSay less.\u201d Sun Dongheng\u2019s mother rolled her eyes and chased after him.\u201cXiao Heng, Xiao Heng.\u201d In the hallway, Sun\u2019s mother caught up with him. She pulled Sun Dongheng and said softly: \u201cYour father is for your own good too.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d Sun Dongheng\u2019s tone was a little sad as he said: \u201cHe scolded me every time for my own good? Besides, I\u2019ve already explained that matter to him many times. It wasn\u2019t because I provoked him, so he didn\u2019t listen to what I had to say. \u201d\u201cYes, yes, yes.\u201d Sun\u2019s mother followed and said: \u201cMom understands, your father is just anxious, he hope that you can succeed his career.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like the software industry. I\u2019ve already said that my dream is to be a celebrity. Why doesn\u2019t my dad support me? You want me to learn some lousy software, I\u2019m not interested in that! \u201d Sun Dongheng said angrily.Why did he inherit his father\u2019s dream? Why couldn\u2019t his father understand he and support him?Sun Dongheng was very confused.At this time, a hint of bitterness and sorrow flashed across Sun\u2019s mother\u2019s eyes. She shook her head and forced out a smile, saying: \u201cYour father is also not having an easy time, you \u2026 \u2026 By the way, what did you just say you wanted eight hundred thousand dollars for? Didn\u2019t I give you three hundred thousand this month? \u201d\u201cI, I\u2026It\u2019s useful. This time, I really have serious business to attend to.\u201d Sun Dongheng slowly said.\u201cWhat is it? Tell Mom. \u201d The Sun\u2019s mother said with a smile.\u201cI \u2026\u201d \u201cI want to get a membership card for a restaurant.\u201d\u201cRestaurant membership card? It won\u2019t cost that much money. \u201d Sun\u2019s mother was puzzled.\u201cMom.\u201d Sun Dongheng muttered to himself for a moment, then said: \u201cThis restaurant is called Mengmeng\u2019s casual restaurant, the membership price is one million, the Egg-Fried Rice in this restaurant is delicious, whatever the boss cooks is delicious, the household dishes are especially delicious too, but, besides the Egg-Fried Rice, everything else needs to be eaten by members, Mom, if you and I will go eat tomorrow morning, and you will know.\u201d\u201cAlright, then Mom will accompany you in the morning.\u201d Sun\u2019s mother nodded.\u201cOkay, thank you, Mom.\u201d Sun Dongheng laughed at this time.Needless to say, in Sun Dongheng\u2019s opinion, if his mother tasted the Egg-Fried Rice, she would definitely give him a membership card. Then, Sun Dongheng waved his hand towards Sun\u2019s mother and said, \u201cMom, I\u2019ll go back now.\u201d\u201cYes, drive slowly.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dWhen Sun Dongheng left, the Sun\u2019s mother sighed deeply and walked back to the house. Seeing that Sun Ming was coughing non-stop, her expression turned bitter, and quickly patted on Sun Ming\u2019s back lightly.\u201cWhy are you angry at your child \u2026\u201d Sun\u2019s mother said in a choked voice.\u201cCough cough \u2026\u201d \u201cSigh\u2026\u201dSun Ming coughed for a while, then took away the handkerchief in his hand. There were a few streaks of fresh red blood in the center of his hand, causing Sun Ming to sigh deeply and say:\u201cI\u2019m not angry, I\u2019m just anxious, I don\u2019t have much time left. If he continues like this, then the company will lose all hope. The company has closed down, what about your lives \u2026\u201d\u201cHow about telling Xiao Heng?\u201d Sun\u2019s mother said with his eyes red.Sun Ming sighed and shook his head slightly.\u2026\u2026.The next morning.Not long after Zhang Han opened the door, the manager of the neighborhood shop walked in, and lightly nodded towards Zhang Han as he sat at a table in the corner.\u201cBoss, one Egg Fried Rice.\u201d the manager asked.\u201cAbout half an hour.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cAlright.\u201dA few minutes after he entered, a silver white horse, Z4, pulled up in front of the restaurant.\u201cMom, I promise you that you will definitely have a surprise later!\u201d Sun Dongheng welcomed Sun\u2019s mother out of the carriage with a smile.\u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll have a taste of it later.\u201dSun\u2019s mother smiled slightly. Her personality was very gentle, and she had the demeanor of a lady. Before entering, she purposely looked at the notice board in front of the door.When she found out that the opening hours and the high price of the membership card were already up, her gaze couldn\u2019t help but reveal a bit of curiosity.She did not understand why such a small restaurant would be so \u2026 Strange.\u201cGood morning, Boss! Where is Mengmeng?\u201d Sun Dongheng greeted, and seeing that Mengmeng was not at the first floor, he asked.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m here \u2026\u201d Suddenly, Mengmeng who was lying on the sofa and playing on the side sat up.\u201cOh hehe, so she was hiding somewhere. Good morning, Little Princess Mengmeng.\u201d Sun Dongheng said with a smile.\u201cMhmm, alright.\u201d Mengmeng waved her arms and replied.\u201cSo cute, so cute, so beautiful.\u201d Sun\u2019s mother\u2019s eyes were immediately filled with love. She really liked children, especially a child with \u201coutstanding genes\u201d like Mengmeng.\u201cOf course, the boss is amazing, it\u2019s only right that his daughter is so pretty.\u201d Sun Dongheng laughed and said: \u201cCome, mother, sit here.\u201dThey sat down and waited in silence.On the other hand, Sun\u2019s mother looked around at the decorations of the dining hall. She recognized the luxurious TV background wall, but she did not know much about the Steinway Piano. From the layout of the house, she felt that the owner had good taste.When it was seven o\u2019clock, the small white dining table was fully filled. People started to line up in the small chairs outside the window.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they come in? Isn\u2019t there a seat there? \u201d Sun\u2019s mother asked curiously.\u201cMom, this is what I told you. Only members can sit there. Look, those four are the first batch of members here.\u201d Sun Dongheng pointed outside.Sun\u2019s mother looked over, Liang Mengqi and the other two got off from the Volkswagen, while Zhao Feng also got off from his Toyota.A few of them came in and greeted Zhang Han and Mengmeng.Very soon, at 7: 20, there were already a dozen of customers waiting at the door. Sun\u2019s mother couldn\u2019t help but feel that the food in this restaurant was really not bad.But she was wrong.When she tasted the first mouthful of Egg-Fried Rice, she finally understood what the real Egg-Fried Rice was. She also finally understood why Sun Dongheng urgently wanted the membership cards here.It was because the Egg-Fried Rice\u2026 It was too fragrant.Sun\u2019s mother enjoyed it while her heart was filled with bitterness. She had cooked at home for dozens of years and had never cooked such a fragrant meal before.\u2018How did he do it\u2026? \u2018Sun\u2019s mother was full of doubts.After finishing the Egg-Fried Rice, Sun\u2019s mother closed his eyes and savored the aftertaste for two minutes.\u201cMom, try some milk.\u201d Sun Dongheng said with a smile on his face.\u201cYes.\u201dSun\u2019s mother lifted her cup and drank her first mouthful of milk.\u201cThis milk \u2026\u201dGurgle gurgle\u2026Sun\u2019s mother finished all the milk in one breath, and then looked at Sun Dongheng in a daze.\u201cHehehe, Mom, how was it? How was the Egg Fried Rice? Is the milk good to drink? \u201d Sun Dongheng said with a look of anticipation.It had to be known that everyone was shocked the most when they ate in this restaurant for the first time. After that, they became addicted to the delicacies here. The shock in their hearts would also disappear and be replaced with deep anticipation.\u201cIt\u2019s really delicious, really delicious.\u201d Sun\u2019s mother sincerely said: \u201cThe boss here is so amazing, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen such a delicious meal, the taste of the milk is also very strong and delicious, but \u2026 \u2026\u201d If it\u2019s so fragrant, there must be something wrong with it. Could it be that something has been added to the meal \u2026 \u201dShe had read before that some kind of delicacy was extremely delicious. In the end, she found out that there was a chemical additive inside that was extremely harmful to the body.Seeing her expression, Sun Dongheng laughed and said: \u201cHey, mom, you can put your heart in your stomach. The food here is delicious because of the inherent problems, the boss has said before, the Thai fragrant rice and the North American wild rice can\u2019t compare to his rice, and you see, the boss\u2019s daughter also eats like this, do you think that as a father, he will make the child eat badly? Also, that cute little princess is called Mengmeng, and this restaurant was opened by the owner for his daughter.What about my dad\uff1f\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that, your dad cares a lot about you.\u201d Sun\u2019s mother said gently, \u201cYour father specifically gave me a bank card this morning. Inside it is the money for you to apply for a membership card.\u201d\u201cOh \u2026\u201d Sun Dongheng replied somewhat depressingly.\u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019ll register for your membership card.\u201d Sun\u2019s mother laughed and pulled Sun Dongheng\u2019s hand to the counter.Liked it?

This restaurant seemed to have the potential to be a underworld restaurant. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that the food was really delicious, Sun\u2019s mother would have definitely turned around and left.\u201cI don\u2019t accept appointments. The opening hours are written at the entrance. Sometimes, it might not be open.\u201d Zhang Han answered truthfully.\u201cThis \u2026\u201d Sun\u2019s mother\u2019s expression froze.\u201cAiya, Mom, the boss\u2019 member meal is even better, and it\u2019s also always done. Since we\u2019ve already cooked the usual dishes and dumplings at home, it looks really delicious, and the boss also said that from now on, there will only be more and more delicacies. The first ten members will be sold cheaply.\u201d Sun Dongheng said in a somewhat anxious tone.\u201cThen I\u2019ll buy three membership cards.\u201d Sun\u2019s mother pondered for a moment. Although he felt that the price was quite expensive, he was still unable to resist the temptation of the delicacies.After transferring money to Zhang Han\u2019s account, Zhang Han took out a membership card from the drawer. Five, six, seven.\u201cGreat, I finally have a membership card.\u201d Sun Dongheng beamed with joy as he took out the number five membership card as if it was a treasure.\u201cLet\u2019s go back first. Call your dad over tonight and have a taste.\u201d The Sun\u2019s mother smiled.\u201cMm. Alright.\u201d With a membership card, Sun Dongheng was elated and smiled as he nodded in agreement.Originally, Sun Dongheng wanted to sit and listen to Zhang Han play the two piano pieces, but when he turned his head, he saw that the table he was sitting at was occupied, so he left with his mother.He had forgotten that he was already a member of the restaurant and that he could sit as a member.\u2026\u2026At eight-thirty, the customers left one after another. Zhao Dahu and Zhao Feng cleaned up the restaurant before leaving.Ding \u2026Zhang Han\u2019s phone rang. This was Zi Yan\u2019s daily call.\u201cZhang Han.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt was a uniform start, but this time, Zi Yan said with a happy tone:\u201cI could finish my work tomorrow noon, I plan to take a stroll in Lin Hai. What kind of gift do you think I should bring to Mengmeng? \u201d\u201cBuy whatever you want.\u201d Zhang Han answered casually.\u201cHow can I do whatever I want? I have to give her the gift that she wants the most. In this way, every time I return after finishing my work, Mengmeng will look forward to it. \u201d Zi Yan moaned and said: \u201cDo you know if there\u2019s anything that Mengmeng has been wanting?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing special she wants \u2026 Oh yeah, I plan to take her to buy a set of colourful brushes today, that\u2019s what she really wants. \u201d Zhang Han thought about it and replied.\u201cColorful Brush Set? Okay, I got it. Don\u2019t buy it for Mengmeng, I will buy a whole set and take it back with me. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you go back to the Hong Kong to buy it.\u201d Zhang Han did not know whether to laugh or cry.\u201cThat won\u2019t do, the meaning is different. Hmph, only a brute like you won\u2019t understand human feelings.\u201d Zi Yan snorted and said: \u201cAlright, give me a call to Mengmeng. I want to chat with my daughter.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han shook his head, walked to the sofa and handed the phone over to Mengmeng.\u201cMama?\u201d Mengmeng blinked her large and clear eyes, and after she received the phone, the Little Princess said sweetly: \u201cMama, Mama, when will you come back? I misses you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThis conversation would probably take a while.When the two were chatting, Zhang Han was free. He sat in front of his laptop, planning to check the progress of the song he posted on internet.If Li Fan were to know of this scene, he would definitely mutter to himself with incomparable nervousness, \u201cHurry up and come up with the software, hurry up and come up with the software! Brother, I\u2019m begging you, hurry up and open it \u2026\u201dHowever, just as Zhang Han was about to open the software, a guest came into the restaurant.The guest attracted Zhang Han\u2019s attention, he stood up and walked over.\u201cSir, here are the twenty photos you requested.\u201d The staff member of photo studio handed over the long box with a smile.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han smiled as he received the box.\u201cThen, mister, I\u2019ll take my leave. If you want to take photos in the future, please pay a visit to our studio.\u201d The staff member smiled and said goodbye before leaving.Zhang Han placed the box on the table and opened it. Inside was a large picture.\u201cMom\u2026Ugh\u2026I\u2019m not going to talk to you anymore, I want to look at beautiful photographs with PaPa \u2026 \u201d Seeing that, Mengmeng\u2019s eyes lit up, and said with a childish voice.\u201cPhotographs?\u201d Zi Yan was slightly taken aback.Just when he wanted to say something, a beep beep sound came from the phone.\u201cYou\u2019re hanging up again?\u201dZi Yan was furious in his heart: \u201cMengmeng learned to hang up on me.Muttering, a hint of worry surfaced in Zi Yan\u2019s eyes.Mengmeng seemed to be getting better and better with her PaPa. Then, one day, would Mengmeng still be able to leave Zhang Han? Would she leave and follow Zhang Han? What should he do then?Without Mengmeng, Zi Yan didn\u2019t even dare to think what she would do.She wanted to finish work as soon as possible and return to properly look after Mengmeng. Moreover, she also wanted to bring Mengmeng back to the Yunyin Garden and let her leave for a few days. She didn\u2019t want Mengmeng to rely too much on Zhang Han.Of course, all this worry stemmed from a lack of sense of security.If a woman did not have a sense of security, she would naturally let her imagination run wild.Furthermore, it was not easy for Zi Yan to foster Mengmeng. It must be known that raising a three-and-a-half old baby was an extremely tiring and tiring task. Anyone with experience in this field would definitely know that a baby was the hardest to take care of.Compared to the worried atmosphere around Zi Yan, the inside of Mengmeng\u2019s casual restaurant was really peaceful.\u201cPaPa, PaPa, this photo looks really good, you have to put it on.\u201d Mengmeng looked at the first photo, it was a photo of Mengmeng and PaPa.\u201cOkay, put this one up.\u201d Zhang Han said with a light smile.\u201cThis is also good. PaPa is so handsome, you have to put it on.\u201d\u201cThis is also good. Mengmeng pouted, PaPa pouted too, hehe\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd this, and this \u2026\u201d\u201cI want this too, this is also good to look at \u2026\u201dVery quickly, Mengmeng commented all twenty pictures. In Mengmeng\u2019s eyes, whether it was his own or her picture with PaPa, they were both very beautiful.\u201cEh \u2026\u201d Zhang Han didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, and said: \u201cMengmeng, we only have fourteen picture frames, so we can only choose fourteen of them.\u201d\u201cMhmm, no.\u201d Mengmeng pouted when she heard it, and said unhappily: \u201cYou all have to hang on it, these are all nice to watch \u2026 \u2026\u201d\u201cSure, everyone hangs up.\u201d Zhang Han laughed and said: \u201cListen to Mengmeng, okay?\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Mengmeng immediately became happy again, and she chuckled: \u201cPaPa is the best.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dZhang Han shook his head and laughed: \u201cWe can hang 14 on the first floor, there are still 6 left. Why don\u2019t we pick one and hang it on the second floor? So we can see our pictures on the first and second floors. \u201d\u201cUgh \u2026Okay.\u201dMengmeng thought it over and agreed. She and PaPa picked the six photos that were to be put on the stairs and chose for an hour.In the end, Zhang Han placed eight photos of him and Mengmeng on the first floor\u2019s piano side, and six separate photos of Mengmeng were taken on the other wall. Of the six photos left on the second floor, two of the photos were taken together with four separate photos of Mengmeng.\u201cPaPa, there\u2019s no such thing as\u2019 frame \u2018on the second floor.\u201d Mengmeng said as she pointed to the big black picture frame on the wall with her little hand.\u201cThen let\u2019s go out and buy a few picture frames.\u201d Zhang Han said.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go to the shopping mall. Buy, buy, buy.\u201d Mengmeng really liked shopping with the PaPa.Every time she had gone to the mall with Mama, she wanted to have snacks, but mama had only bought her a few, and she had always bought a limited amount of toys.As Zi Yan\u2019s saying , children could not recklessly buy something.But when it came to Zhang Han later on, this guy was done.Snack, buy, buy, buy.Toy, buy, buy.This really made Mengmeng experienced the true essence of shopping, every shopping cart was full to the brim.But relatively speaking, buying toys and other things to play was a bit more. Zhang Han wouldn\u2019t buy her too much snacks, but Zhang Han would say that.\u201cMengmeng, after you eating these snacks out, we will buy more.\u201dThat made Mengmeng pleased.However, every time she finished eating, Zhang Han would only go to the supermarket after some days. He would not let Mengmeng eat too many snacks.Right now, when Mengmeng heard that they were going out to buy clothes, she was overjoyed. She followed PaPa upstairs to change her clothes, then went downstairs to his car and drove to the nearby shopping mall.\u201cGo buy a car.\u201dZhang Han pondered for a moment, this Jeep Wrangler that he rented was only a temporary car, he did not have enough money in the beginning, so he did not buy it. Now, Zhang Han had over 6 million in his bank card, which was enough to buy a car.In these four days of operation, Zhang Han earned more than seven million and sold seven membership cards. After deducting the one million that was spent on membership cards, he deposited about six million and three hundred thousand, but Zhang Han did not care about the exact amount of money.Moreover, if you bought a car, you could buy most of the cars with 6 million. Of course, there were even more expensive ones such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom Shadow, the Aston Martin which were worth tens of millions, and various supercars which were worth tens of millions.But Zhang Han did not plan to buy them, if it was in the past, Zhang Han might be chasing after luxurious cars, but now, Zhang Han could only give a light smile.Liked it?

    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 - Mengmeng loves PandaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euThat year, Han Yang Immortal\u2019s usual vehicle was rode the Nine Dragons Chariot when he wanted to go out. The Nine Dragons Chariot was a high-end treasure in the Cultivation World, how could ordinary cars compare to it.With different perspectives, the goal would be different as well. even if a Lamborghini and a Jetta were placed together, in Zhang Han\u2019s eyes, they are the same, just cars.\u201cMengmeng, let\u2019s go buy a car first, then buy a photo frame, okay?\u201dZhang Han was always rather casual, doing whatever he wanted to do, looking at Mengmeng from the rearview mirror and asking.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Buy a toy car? \u201d Mengmeng\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d Zhang Han didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, and said: \u201cIt\u2019s a car, like the one that Daddy is driving now.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Mengmeng thought for a while, then answered with her childish voice, \u201cEh \u2026 Listen to PaPa. \u201dThe little princess was not very interested in driving a car, but was very happy to be with PaPa.\u201cThen let\u2019s go buy a car first.\u201d While Zhang Han was waiting for a red light, he took out his phone and checked the location of the Automobile City.Automobile City is a kind of car market that collects many car dealers and car brands in the same site and forms a centralized and diversified trading place. It includes various brands and types, which is convenient to buy a car, with such advantages as wide choice, convenient to serve, standard of management, a combination of consultation, car selection, loan, insurance, trading, acquisition and service.After finding the location, Zhang Han rushed towards the direction of the car city.The Hong Kong was a paradise for the rich, and a hell for the workers.At the front desk behind the main gate of the car city stood more than a dozen of buyers.They were all waiting to receive guests, and also according to the way they queued to keep them serve the customers orderly. Every time after they served a customer and returned to line to queue, they would also get a moment to rest.\u201cAchoo \u2026\u201dThe woman ranking the first suddenly sneezed. From the looks of her face, she seemed to have caught a cold.\u201cLili, how did you catch a cold?\u201d a man at the back said.\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, it was a bit cold when I accompanied a customer taking the test drive yesterday.\u201d Lili sighed lightly.\u201cHehe, it\u2019s because you\u2019re wearing too little, aren\u2019t you trying to seduce the customer and failed?\u201d Another man quipped.\u201cpiss off.\u201d Lili rolled his eyes in annoyance.\u201cGuests are coming. It\u2019s a Jeep Wrangler.\u201d The man who spoke had sharp eyes. After staring at the blue paint on the car license plate and tires, he said: \u201cRented car, this person might have casually driven here to buy a car, Lili, so this deal will probably work.\u201d\u201cAchoo \u2026\u201d Lili snorted lightly, looked at the other pony-tail girl behind him and said: \u201cXiao Yun, why don\u2019t you take this one? I want to rest for a while. \u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201d The girl called Xiao Yun nodded and stood up to welcome the customer.\u201cwell, how could the person who rented the car be a rich person?\u201d Lili shook her head and sighed.The men behind shook their heads and silently smiled.As a professional sealer, naturally she had a good eyesight. The man could tell that Zhang Han had rented a car with a glance, and also checked Zhang Han for a few times, his outfits was also above average, but the little girl in his arms, who seemed to be dressed in jeans, was rather fashionable.These news made Old Saler feel that Zhang Han was not a wealthy person, he might not necessarily come here to buy a car, it was possible for him to buy some parts, or even some other things after sale.Lili was a little tired from the cold and did not want to be busy in vain, so she sent the Xiao Yun behind to receive him.Xiao Yun was a newbie, so she did not understand the various rules and directly agreed. After going over to greet them, she had a warm smile on her face:\u201cHello sir, welcome to Wheelley City. Would you like to see a car or?\u201d\u201cWe came to see the car.\u201d Mengmeng raised her small hand and answered.\u201cWhat a beautiful little girl.\u201d Xiao Yun could not help but praise her.Facing such praise, Mengmeng was more or less immune to it.\u201cSir, do you have any models that you like?\u201d The Xiao Yun asked with a smile.\u201cNo, just take a look.\u201d Zhang Han replied indifferently.\u201cAlright sir, this way please.\u201dThe Xiao Yun said with a smile. He was slightly faster than Zhang Han and took the lead to walk towards the right side of the carriage.\u201cSir, our city has a total of thirty-six brands, with all kinds of low, medium, and high-end cars. Look, this car over here is the latest generation of mass Meteng. It\u2019s very cost-effective and also quite a popular car.\u201dSeeing Zhang Han turn his head slightly, Xiao Yun immediately took the lead and walked a few steps forward. He pointed to the car at the side and said: \u201cThis carriage is meant for the volkswagen \u2026\u201dZhang Han carried Mengmeng and kept walking forward, passing through the area filled with Volkswagen and arriving at the Buick section. After a while, they headed to the Ford section.\u201cMengmeng, did you see those cars that you liked just now?\u201d Zhang Han smiled and asked.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d I can\u2019t remember what it looks like, so many, many \u2026 \u201d Mengmeng pouted.\u201cThen let\u2019s take a look at the SUVs, only the higher end.\u201d Zhang Han nodded, and said while looking at Xiao Yun.\u201cAlright sir, this way please.\u201d Xiao Yun\u2019s eyes lit up.Looking at Zhang Han\u2019s indifferent attitude, it seemed as if he was really here to buy a car. Xiao Yun took the lead and walked towards the SUV area, and started introducing it very professionally:\u201cIt\u2019s a high-end SUV. Look at this one, it\u2019s a Babos M grade \u2026\u201d\u201cThis is the Cadillac Khaled\u2026\u201d Sir, how about the new BMW X5\u2026 And BMW X6 \u2026 \u201cThat\u2019s Audi Q7 \u2026\u201dXiao Yun introduced a lot while she sized up Zhang Han\u2019s expression, but Zhang Han had a calm expression the entire time, which made Xiao Yun unable to guess what Zhang Han was thinking.After he had seen enough, Zhang Han asked Mengmeng again, \u201cMengmeng, did you like the ones that you saw just now?\u201d\u201cUgh \u2026\u201d \u201cEverything\u2019s fine, it looks like it\u2019s about the same \u2026\u201d Mengmeng thought about it and replied.Of the father and daughter pair, Zhang Han was very casual, he could buy any kind of car he wanted. Mengmeng was not very interested in the big car, so this time, buying a car was bound to be a waste of time.Even the Xiao Yun beside him felt her mouth going dry.\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look at the sports car.\u201d Zhang Han said indifferently.\u201cAlright sir, this way please.\u201d Xiao Yun smiled and nodded.\u201cThis BMW Z4 is a classic \u2026 This is Porsche 911\u2026 There\u2019s a Porsche 458 over there, this Maserati GT what do you think\u2026 \u201cAnd that Lamborghini \u2026\u201dAfter looking around, Zhang Han looked at Mengmeng again, and asked: \u201cIs there a car you like?\u201dUnder the Xiao Yun\u2019s anticipating gaze, Mengmeng thought for a while, then pouted her lips and replied, \u201cNo.\u201dMengmeng\u2019s answer couldn\u2019t help but cause Xiao Yun to feel somewhat discouraged.they had already walked more than half of the car city and had pretty much seen enough cars. If they are not interested in any of them, then they would probably be blown away.Xiao Yun even suspected that if Zhang Han really came to buy a car.But in the next moment, Mengmeng\u2019s words gave her hope.Mengmeng looked around with her clear and large eyes, suddenly raised her arm, and pointed forward, saying:\u201cPaPa, PaPa, that car looks really good \u2026\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dZhang Han and Xiao Yun\u2019s gaze followed the direction that the small palm was pointing at.When Xiao Yun saw the carriage, her heart jumped and she became excited again.\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look.\u201d Zhang Han said, and took the lead to walk towards the carriage.Xiao Yun quickly followed and said with a warm smile:\u201cSir, this car is the extended version of the Peak Creation of the Land-Rover, its capacity is 5.0 mechanical engine, its maximum horsepower is 550HP, and the 100km acceleration is 5.2 seconds. This is a car that was recently produced, it is also the most luxurious car in the Land-Rover series, we all call it the most luxurious SUV in the world, and judging from its overbearing strength, it really suits you.\u201d\u201cHmm, not bad, not bad.\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s gaze was still calm, but it was also the first time that he had said something to praise her.\u201cYes, sir. The interior of this car is also very luxurious. There are \u2026\u201dSeeing that there was hope, Xiao Yun was prepared to properly introduce this carriage, but the little princess\u2019 childish voice ruthlessly interrupted her:\u201cEn, no, no. It\u2019s not this. It\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s that. That\u2019s the one that\u2019s pretty.\u201dMengmeng pointed to a spot not far away from the Land-Rover.When Xiao Yun looked over, her expression froze.Parked there was a very cute looking Geely Panda.\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look.\u201d Zhang Han smiled lightly.The Xiao Yun\u2019s mood dropped from the peak to the bottom, and she felt unspeakably uncomfortable. However, she still said respectfully: \u201cThis car is a Geely Panda, its front face is designed with a large mouth, and the entire face gives off a very cute feeling. This car is a cute version, and its price is thirty-five thousand nine hundred and nine hundred and fifty \u2026\u201dThe Xiao Yun began to explain the information she told him, which Zhang Han naturally understood.In the past, Zhang Han had studied cars before, and there were a dozen or so super sports cars. Although he was a little casual about cars now, it seemed that the car\u2019s configuration was still a little low.\u201cPaPa, this looks nice, don\u2019t you think it looks like a giant panda? It\u2019s so cute, so cute.\u201d Mengmeng chuckled.\u201cThen buy this one.\u201d Zhang Han smiled lightly and said to the Xiao Yun.\u201cAlright.\u201d The Xiao Yun smiled and said: \u201cSir, this way please, I will bring you to pay.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dZhang Han followed Xiao Yun to the trading hall.When he was about to sign the bill, Zhang Han suddenly raised his head and asked: \u201cCan I change the car here?\u201d\u201cRefit?\u201d Xiao Yun was startled, he did not understand much about this matter and subconsciously looked at the old employee in charge of this transaction.\u201cYes, it can be modified. I will call the master over. Sir, can you help me with that?\u201d The old employee said with a smile.\u201cYes.\u201dAfter waiting for five minutes, a man in his forties wearing a blue uniform walked over. He nodded to the old employee and looked at Zhang Han: \u201cMister bought a Geely Panda? \u201cMay I know how sir wishes to change it?\u201d\u201crefit it to the best.\u201dZhang Han\u2019s words caused the few people present to be slightly stunned.\u201cSir, there\u2019s no limit to how much you can modify.\u201d He did not know how much the buyer of the Geely Panda would be willing to spend to modify it.Liked it?

    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 - \uff2dodificationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euWhen Zhang Han decided to buy the car, Xiao Yun was confused, because she thought that he was a petty rich man. However, now that he wanted to talk about modifying the car, no matter how much money it cost, as long as it was sold by her, it would be considered as her performance!Thinking about it, she felt a little exciting in her heart. Money is money, but she didn\u2019t expect that the surprise would come so suddenly.\u201cThe shape of the car can be moved slightly. It looks more like a panda, cute, engine, interior etc. I want the best one.\u201d Zhang Han muttered to himself.\u201cThe best \u2026\u201d The craftsman thought for a bit, looked at Zhang Han\u2019s face, and said with a hesitant tone: \u201cIf it\u2019s the engine, I can exchange it with Audi A8L for you, but regarding the price \u2026\u201d\u201cThe price doesn\u2019t matter. What I want is the appearance of this car. I want the best configuration, so you can make a list now.\u201d Zhang Han said.\u201cOh, okay, please wait a moment. I\u2019ll write it down for you now.\u201d The skilled worker\u2019s eyes lit up. He picked up a pen and began writing.Fifteen minutes later, a list was placed before Zhang Han\u2019s eyes. Xiao Yun glanced at it from the side, she did not really understand those complicated parts, but she clearly saw the seventeen million transaction price at the end of the list.\u2018One million and seven hundred thousand\u2026 \u2018Xiao Yun\u2019s heart jumped, she was once again excited. After all, selling it for 1.7 million, she could get quite a bit of commission!\u201d Okay, just modify according to what you have written. I\u2019ll give you two million, and help me take care of the license plate and the film, and then send it to the New Moon Bay Mengmeng\u2019s casual restaurant tomorrow. \u201d Zhang Han looked at it for a few seconds, he understood the details of the system well, and felt satisfied and nodded his head.\u201cAlright Mister, then how do we write this order \u2026\u201d the technician asked, swallowing his saliva.\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201dAll of a sudden, everyone\u2019s eyes lit up, and in the end, they gave Zhang Han the order for the sum of 1.8 million, but if the price was two million, then the extra two hundred thousand was equivalent to a tip.After that, he began to process some documents, made a few copies of his identity card, signed some documents, and after the work was done. It was already 12 o\u2019clock.After taking care of all of this, Zhang Han left the city with Mengmeng, and headed towards the nearby shopping mall to buy picture frames.Xiao Yun, on the other hand, brought along Zhang Han to sell. She chatted with the old employees who were involved in the transaction and the technical masters for a while, and in the end, about the two hundred thousand, Xiao Yun and the technical masters got ninety thousand each, and twenty thousand for the old employees who were involved in the transaction, could also be considered as having a share.The Xiao Yun returned to the stage happily.Not only would she receive 90,000 for this trade list, she would also receive a commission for 1.8 million. However, compared to 90,000, it was much less.\u201cXiao Yun, you sold a car? Is it the customer just now? \u201d Lili asked as she turned around.She had already received a seemingly rich customer, but that person just left after asking around. The other sealers behind her were all the same.Car salesman didn\u2019t sell cars every day and sometimes can only sold one or two cars a month and sometimes didn\u2019t even sell a single car a month.When they saw Lili bring the customer that had just come to the Transaction Center with her, so it was most likely that she must have sold something, Lili could not help but ask.\u201cWell, he did. He bought a car.\u201d The Xiao Yun replied with a smile.Hearing this, everyone\u2019s expression changed slightly as they looked at Xiao Yun with some envy.Lili was even more regretful, he should have been her customer after all, and she had given up just like that!\u201cWhat kind of car did he buy?\u201d Lili took a deep breath and asked.Not only her, but the others also looked over, waiting for Xiao Yun\u2019s answer.For a moment, the atmosphere on the field was somewhat tense.Under everyone\u2019s gaze, the Xiao Yun smiled and replied honestly: \u201cI bought a car filled with Geely Panda, but \u2026\u201dHowever, before she could finish his sentence, a soft laugh could be heard.\u201cGeely Panda \u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine too, it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d\u201cNo matter what, we can still eat a few decent midnight snacks with the commission.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone said something to each other. Although there was no irony in their tone, there was still a trace of contempt and relief in their tone.Even Lili felt as if a heavy burden had been lifted from her shoulders, the regret in her heart had disappeared a lot, but Xiao Yun\u2019s next sentence, stupefied her.\u201cI haven\u2019t finished.\u201d Xiao Yun curled her lips and said: \u201cHe bought the Geely Panda, but he intends to modify it, so the total price he bid for it is 1.8 million.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cRefit? A total of 1.8 million? \u201d\u201cDamn, this is too bad-ass. One million and eight hundred thousand Geely Panda?\u201d\u201cCongratulations, Xiao Yun, you really earned easy from signing this deal!\u201d\u201cAmazing, that customer really has a unique taste. That price is enough to buy a luxury car.\u201dIn the Hong Kong, there were no customs duties, so the prices of the cars were much cheaper than those in the Mainland. However, there were a lot of taxes on the cars bought in the Hong Kong, such as the 1.8m cars, which cost around 500,000 yuan. If that was the case, the prices of the cars would be relatively more expensive than in the Mainland.\u201cOne million eight hundred thousand, my god \u2026\u201d Lili almost bit her own tongue.\u201cThis is too exaggerated. A car worth over 30,000 RMB has to be converted into a luxury grade of 1.8 million RMB? Could it be that that person wants to play a low-key luxury game? \u201d A man muttered softly, feeling that this matter was extremely inconceivable.The Geely Panda walked with the cute style, no matter how he changed it, it wouldn\u2019t be that luxurious!\u201cIt\u2019s not that the customer\u2019s taste is special. It\u2019s just that his daughter likes that car, and that man felt that the configuration was too low, so he changed it to the best one.\u201d The Xiao Yun explained, and then looked at Lili, and laughed: \u201cSister Li, how about we split the commission?\u201dWhen these words came out, everyone\u2019s eyes immediately looked over.Some were surprised, some were amazed, and some were incredulous. However, they all understand why at the same time.In this business of selling, without an old person to guide you through, it would be too difficult for a new person to go through. With an old person to carry you through, it would definitely be much easier.The actions of the Xiao Yun opened up a door to enter the old sales circle.Old Sales knew that money wasn\u2019t earned by one person, and fighting alone was definitely not as powerful as being in a team.Lili was truly surprised and moved, she had already accepted the Xiao Yun as a new employee.The Xiao Yun did not mention anything about the two hundred thousand tips. In her opinion, the ninety thousand tips should be considered a huge surprise and she was ok to split the commission, and by which she could obtain their likings and being together with the old sales would make her path much easier in the future.\u2026\u2026Zhang Han and Mengmeng strolled around the shopping mall and bought six photo frames and a few random things. When they drove back to the dining hall, they could see from afar that there were already more than twenty people sitting in the chairs in front of the dining hall.Seeing that, Zhang Han could not help but laugh bitterly, looking at the time, it was already 13: 10, this group of gluttons had probably been waiting for over an hour.At this moment, a more interesting scene occurred in the spicy dishes restaurant next door. The waitress was at the door, making small talk to lure the customers.\u201cThe food is not expensive anymore, come quickly and taste it \u2026\u201dHowever, her shout didn\u2019t attract anyone over. At the same time that she shouted, her gaze was a little stunned as she looked at the familiar figure in the line of people.Their manager!\u201cOuch, why did our manager join the queue too?\u201d Inside the restaurant, three male waiters were standing in front of the door watching their manager line up to eat at someone else\u2019s place. They felt a strange sensation in their hearts.\u201cThe manager said just now that he was checking the enemy.\u201d\u201cBut didn\u2019t the manager just went there this morning?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. After he returns, he was distracted for the entire morning. I wonder what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just noon and the manager has already lined up. It\u2019s already been an hour and he still hasn\u2019t come back to take a look. Could it be that his family\u2019s food is really delicious?\u201d\u201cNow that you mention it, I think it\u2019s possible. Think about it, if it doesn\u2019t taste good, would they dare to sell it for 300 yuan?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, I have to go and have my lunch there tomorrow.\u201d\u201cCount me in \u2026\u201dAs their manager, he wanted to praise them greatly after he returned from eating the Egg-Fried Rice. However, due to the fact that the restaurant was adjacent to each other and they were competitors, the manager didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cStill not coming back?\u201d After a while, he would go to work, but what could he do? Do I go back hungry at noon? \u201d\u201cWhy isn\u2019t the boss back yet? Where the hell did he go?\u201d\u201cWhat do we do? I\u2019m so hungry that my chest is sticking to my back.\u201d\u201coh, the taste is not expensive. Come and try it, why don\u2019t everyone come to my house to have a taste?\u201d \u201cThe Egg Fried Rice in my house is also very delicious.\u201d The waitress tried saying.When she said this, the manager felt his heart turn dry. Eh, his restaurant does have Egg-Fried Rice, but the taste\u2026 The difference between them was like the difference between heaven and earth.\u201cLittle sister, stop shouting. We only want to eat Egg-Fried Rice.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want anything but Egg Fried Rice and milk.\u201d\u201cEven if I\u2019m hungry, I won\u2019t eat anything else. I only want the Egg Fried Rice!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAlthough everyone was hungry, their thoughts were firm. Unwavering.\u201coh, where did the boss go?\u201d Liang Mengqi lowered his head and said.\u201cHe has probably been busy himself. He\u2019ll probably be back soon.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled slightly.\u201cOh, I\u2019m here, isn\u2019t that the boss\u2019s car?\u201d Yu Qingqing\u2019s eyes suddenly caught sight of the Jip Shepherd and shouted excitedly.Swish!Everyone\u2019s gaze that was like a hungry wolf all turned over. After they saw Zhang Han get off the car, they all stood up and started to complain.\u201cGood heavens! Boss, you\u2019re finally back!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting so hard!\u201d\u201cWe are all going to starve to death if you don\u2019t come back.\u201dZhang Han held onto the photo with his left hand and a few other items as he stretched out his right pinky.Grasping PaPa\u2019s pinky with his small hand, Mengmeng walked over while smiling with small steps.Liked it?

    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - \uff37aiting is sufferingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euAt first, there were a few people who were very anxious, but after seeing the cute and beautiful little princess, the impatience in their hearts gradually disappeared.Everyone liked beauty, and Mengmeng was the most beautiful and cute little girl they had ever seen.When Zhang Han opened the door, a lot of people in line anxiously said:\u201cExcuse me, we have to go to work at 2 o\u2019clock in the afternoon. We don\u2019t have enough time, can we make it a take-out?\u201dZhang Han nodded when he heard this, and said, \u201cAlright.\u201dOnly now did everyone feel relieved.8179.47After entering the dining hall, Liang Mengqi, Yue Yang and the other two sat at the same table as and Sun\u2019s mother. Sun Dongheng and Sun\u2019s mother sat at the neighboring table.\u201cBoss, where did you go?\u201d Why did you come back so late? \u201d Liang Mengqi asked curiously.\u201cI went to buy the photo frame.\u201dZhang Han replied with a smile, then casually placed the photo frame to the side.\u201cPaPa, I want to see an animated film.\u201d Mengmeng took small steps and ran to the front of the sofa. she jumped up and climbed onto the sofa, then turned around and spoke to Zhang Han.\u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d Zhang Han nodded and walked over to switch on the television. There was no need to change the channel, it had only broadcasted a single channel, the Children\u2019s Channel.After that, Zhang Han opened his notebook and placed the music on it, preparing to make lunch.He hadn\u2019t prepared any ingredients yet, but his lunch was still Egg-Fried Rice and Milk.When Zhang Han left the cafeteria in the morning, the rice had already been cooked regularly.After he picked up the rice, Zhang Han started to prepare the supplementary ingredients, such as eggs, onions.\u201cPaPa, mm\u2026 Mengmeng was a little hungry. \u201cI \u2026 I don\u2019t even have the strength to watch TV.\u201d Mengmeng turned and said with her sweet voice.\u201cThe food is almost ready, Mengmeng, don\u2019t be anxious.\u201d Zhang Han hurriedly said.However, when Mengmeng said this, Liang Mengqi and the others\u2019 gazes instantly landed on the kitchen, because whenever this happened, Zhang Han would cook at an unimaginable speed. His movements were fluid and natural. This was a type of visual enjoyment.They looked over, and the others also looked over with curiosity.Zhang Han quickly turned on the electric stove and started to heat up the milk.At the same time, his right hand drew a kitchen knife from the knife holder and his left hand simultaneously placed four green onions on the cutting board.\u201cBang, bang, bang \u2026\u201dAn urgent sound rang out as the saber light dazzled the eyes. In just two seconds, a few of the green onions had been chopped.Zhang Han immediately threw the kitchen knife upwards.This scene caused everyone\u2019s hearts to skip a beat!What? Throw a kitchen knife? No?However, the next scene caused everyone to take in a breath of cold air.He saw the kitchen knife spin twice in the air before inserting itself into the knife\u2019s groove.\u201cOh my god.\u201d Zhao Dahu\u2019s mouth was agape, and he said in shock: \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen such a technique.\u201d\u201cThis is too amazing.\u201d Liang Mengqi\u2019s eyes were wide open: \u201cWow, he is getting more and more handsome.\u201d\u201cMom.\u201d Sun Dongheng said excitedly: \u201cDid you see that? \u201cHaha, Mom, let me tell you, what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. He is so powerful, it\u2019s hard to imagine!\u201dAmongst them, only Yu Qingqing and Zhao Feng had a slightly complicated look in their eyes.\u201cHe \u2026\u201d Zhao Feng was once again shocked by Zhang Han\u2019s technique: \u201cI still underestimated his strength. Just this move alone already showed his control over his strength, and his accuracy in angle. He is already at the peak of perfection, so terrifying like this \u2026 Sigh, I had thought that I could last a minute against him, but I didn\u2019t think that boss would be speaking the truth.Not just them, even the six people sitting at the small white table exclaimed in admiration.Amidst their exclamations of surprise, Zhang Han had already started to cook the Egg-Fried Rice with the two wok pots.The frying pan was not light either, with so much food added inside, it was still somewhat heavy, but the frying pan felt really light in Zhang Han\u2019s hands.Add a series of spices.Three minutes later, the Egg Fried Rice was ready to serve.Zhang Han served himself and Mengmeng, and placed them at the round table. Without needing to mention anything about the others, they had already started to line up to fill the rice.When Mengmeng sat at the dining table and saw the lonely Egg-Fried Rice, she said in her sweet voice:\u201cPaPa, uh\u2026 Why is there only rice? Mengmeng wants to eat the dishes made by the PaPa, he wants to eat \u2026 That \u2026 The long eggplant, and, and\u2026 Mengmeng really wants to eat all the dishes made by PaPa. \u201dWhen she said that, the eyes of Liang Mengqi, Yu Qingqing, Zhao Dahu, Zhao Feng, and the others who had tried the rice all lit up, they all looked at Mengmeng, and subconsciously swallowed their saliva.\u201cSure, then Daddy will cook for you tonight.\u201d Zhang Han laughed and said.\u201cAlright, PaPa is the best. Mengmeng gave Zhang Han a kiss on the air, causing him to smile.Of course, the four people behind also had smiles on their faces. They looked at each other, and all of them happily smiled as they muttered in their hearts:\u201cMengmeng is great, Mengmeng is the best. Aw, little princess, in the future, say more things like this\u2026\u201dEveryone knew in their hearts that their 100 sentences of 1000 words could not even compare to the few words that Mengmeng had said.They even felt that as long as Mengmeng spoke, it didn\u2019t matter if he was flying in the sky, running on the ground, or swimming in the water, Zhang Han would always bring food for his daughter!\u201cSigh, Mengmeng is really blessed.\u201dThe few of them sighed in their hearts.The restaurant started to serve food. People outside also started to line up to pick up the food which they would bring with them.Basically, everyone had to have at least one serving of Egg-Fried Rice and two cups of milk.It was just like an auto supermarket, when people is done eating, they put the money on the check-out counter, and Zhang Han didn\u2019t care to checks the money.However, no one would pay less here. They felt that if they cheated, it would be a blasphemy to the God Tier Fried Rice with Eggs.The restaurant\u2019s opening hours were short. After half an hour, it was not even 2 in the afternoon and most of the customers in the restaurant had already left. Only Liang Mengqi and the rest were still drinking their milk leisurely.\u201cEh? Changed the picture? \u201d Liang Mengqi suddenly saw a series of photos on the wall. He could not help but be surprised, as she put down the milk and stood up to check.\u201cWow, she\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d When Zhao Dahu saw the photo of Mengmeng on the side of the piano, she could not help but exclaim out loud.\u201cThe photo of Mengmeng and the owner is really too lovable,\u201d Yu Qingqing said with a face full of envy.\u201c\u2026\u201dFacing the praises of the few people, Mengmeng was a little happy as she started to hum a song.Those pictures, Mengmeng could even see them clearly. Especially the picture of her together with the PaPa, it looked really good.After observing for a while, Zhao Dahu and Zhao Feng started to act as waiters again, cleaning up the dining hall.Maybe it had been out of goodwill for the first two times, but now they were getting used to it.Next door, at the spicy dishes restaurant.\u201cBurp\u2026\u201dThe manager burped and rubbed his stomach as he walked into the room.He had eaten three servings of Egg Fried Rice and drank five cups of milk in the afternoon. The money he spent on this meal was equivalent to the amount of money he spent on a feast!\u201cManager, how delicious is his restaurant\u2019s food?\u201d one of the waiters asked quietly.\u201cSo delicious \u2026\u201d Cough cough, why are you asking so many questions? \u201cGo to work!\u201d The manager coughed lightly and waved his hand.\u201coh, manager, just tell me about it.\u201d The waitress said in a slightly coquettish tone.\u201cYeah, yeah, manager. Seeing as you\u2019re so satisfied, there\u2019s definitely something going on!\u201d\u201cManager, can you tell me if it\u2019s tasty or not?\u201dThe few of them gathered in front of the manager and whispered.\u201cEh \u2026\u201d The manager\u2019s expression froze for a moment and he muttered to himself. Under the gazes of the others, he nodded heavily and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not delicious, it\u2019s \u2026 It was so fucking delicious! Let me tell you, that Egg-Fried Rice is so fragrant that it can\u2019t be described. Oh, fuck, so amazing. Do you know that there are already seven members in that restaurant?! Oh my god, 7 million! But the boss is really awesome, right, the boss is very handsome, cooking is like a show, whoosh whoosh whoosh, his daughter, even if she is beautiful to the point of being invincible, and there\u2019s even milk, so delicious! My god, I\u2019ve never drunk milk so delicious, I\u2019ll tell you guys \u2026 \u201dSince the manager had already made his decision, he wanted to say it all.The waiters listened as if they were in a dream, their eyes turning green. Listening to the manager\u2019s tone, only immortals could taste the Egg-Fried Rice, so they planned to go over to have a taste at night no matter what.\u2026\u2026In the dining hall, Liang Mengqi and the other three did not plan to leave, since it was 2 in the afternoon and dinner time was around 6, they would stay in the dining hall for a few hours.They were just standing there. But Zhang Han had something important to do.\u201cMengmeng, let\u2019s go upstairs to change and go play in Mount New Moon.\u201d Zhang Han chuckled.\u201cEh?\u201d Mengmeng was startled, then her eyes lit up and raised her little hand: \u201cOh oh oh oh, go look for Little Heihei to play!\u201dMengmeng\u2019s cheers caught Liang Mengqi\u2019s attention, causing her to immediately put down the phone and say:\u201cBoss, I want to go as well.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the illusory Mount New Moon s after her last visit. Now that she had the chance, she didn\u2019t plan on letting it go.\u201cOK.\u201dZhang Han nodded and carried Mengmeng to the second floor.\u201cIs the Mount New Moon very fun?\u201d Yu Qingqing asked without even raising her head as she played the game.\u201cOf course, that was the fairy land that the boss had created for Mengmeng.\u201d Liang Mengqi replied.\u201cThe boss must have built it. It\u2019s definitely not simple.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled slightly as he looked at Liang Mengqi, and said: \u201cI also want to take a look.\u201d\u201cWhy cant you just leave us alone\u201d Liang Mengqi snorted and said: \u201d If You want to go, ask the boss, why me?\u201dZhao Feng was speechless once again. He was a little confused in his heart, just how had he offended her? Why was she always so stiff when talking to himr?Thinking about the tone Liang Mengqi used with the boss, Zhao Feng could not help but laugh bitterly to himself.Why did she being so gentle when talking to the owner.Liked it?

He took out the phone and saw that it was from Zhang Li.\u201cBro, I\u2019ll go to your place at seven or eight o\u2019clock tomorrow night. I\u2019ll go shopping with a few colleagues during the day.\u201d Zhang Li said.\u201cOK.\u201d\u201cYou have to prepare delicious food for me that night. Let me try if your cooking is a kitchen killer or not, huh.\u201d Zhang Li said with a smile.\u201cI will prepare a sumptuous dinner for you tomorrow. Oh right, Mengmeng\u2019s mother is coming back tomorrow, she will arrive at 10 o\u2019clock at night. Let\u2019s eat dinner together then.\u201d Zhang Han said.\u201cIs that so?\u201d Zhang Li was slightly surprised: \u201cThen it\u2019s just the right time for me to see my sister-in-law. You didn\u2019t tell you about her the last time I asked you, and you made it so mysterious. I\u2019m going to see for myself just who became my sister-in-law and who gave birth to such a cute girl as Mengmeng.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not your sister-in-law yet, so say anything like that in front of her.\u201dZhang Han answered. He didn\u2019t care, he just didn\u2019t know what Zi Yan was thinking.\u201cOh, I understand. Then can you tell me who she is?\u201d Zhang Li asked curiously.\u201cYou\u2019ll know when we meet tomorrow.\u201d Zhang Han said as his phone vibrated. A call came in.So, Zhang Han hung up the phone, looked at his phone, and it was Zi Yan who called. Zhang Han picked it up.\u201cZhang Han.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t buy that colorful painting brush for Mengmeng, right?\u201d Zi Yan went straight to the point.\u201cNope.\u201d\u201cwell behaved.\u201d Zi Yan said with a slight smile.Zhang Han\u2019s expression stiffened, feeling speechless.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go shopping. I won\u2019t be talking to you anymore. Bye bye.\u201d With that, Zi Yan hung up the phone.Even she herself did not know that the tone of her conversation with Zhang Han had changed greatly.It had to be known that she had an ice-cold appearance to the outsiders, like an ice goddess. She never really smiled, and only when she felt close to someone, would she take off her ice-cold disguise.However, Zhang Han didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.Carrying Mengmeng downstairs, the four were already fully equipped and ready to go.\u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026\u201d Mengmeng waved her arm and cheered.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dLiang Mengqi said while smiling.After leaving the house, they drove for ten minutes before arriving at Mount New Moon.There was no doubt, other than Liang Mengqi, the other three people had the same surprising expression.\u201cAowu \u2026\u201dUpon seeing the newcomer, little black\u2019s eyes lit up and ran over like a ferocious tiger.It opened its mouth, revealing sharp fangs, and looked at Zhao Feng fiercely. This was because it could feel a ruthless aura from Zhao Feng\u2019s body.Zhao Feng\u2019s muscles also tensed up. He frowned and stared at Little Black, feeling that it was somewhat inconceivable, because he actually felt a trace of threat from Little Black\u2019s body!Threats?He was just a dog after all!There was astonishment deep within Zhang Han\u2019s eyes.It was one thing when Zhao Feng was strong since he was an expert. However, why did the his dog have the aura of a powerful expert?\u201cZhang Han, this dog \u2026\u201d Zhao Dahu swallowed his saliva, feeling a little afraid.\u201cLittle black, Mengmeng has missed you. Have you thought about Mengmeng?\u201dMengmeng twisted in Zhang Han\u2019s embrace, after seeing this, he laughed and placed Mengmeng on the ground, then she ran to little black.After running two steps, because of the hurried footsteps, Mengmeng stumbled and almost fell to the ground.\u201cAooo \u2026\u201d \u201cOh, oh!\u201dLittle black was so scared that its whole body trembled, and it could not care less about acting cool, its body quickly jumped up. When Mengmeng fell down, she fell on Little black\u2019s stomach as usual.\u201cHuff \u2026\u201d \u201cHuff \u2026\u201d Little Black heaved a sigh of relief.This scene caused the muscles on Zhao Feng\u2019s face to tremble.\u2018What the hell? \u2018Zhao Feng was a little shocked. He felt that Little Black\u2019s speed just now was inconceivable.How could it became so fast in an instant? This meant that little black\u2019s legs were very strong, otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t be able to provide such speed!\u201cHaha \u2026\u201d Little black\u2026 Come on, let\u2019s go over there and play with the dogs. \u201d Mengmeng stood up, patted little black\u2019s head, and then took little black to where the other dogs were.\u201cHmph, how is it? Isn\u2019t this beautiful? Seeing how all of you are staring, it\u2019s so embarrassing, hehe, I\u2019m going over there to play too. \u201d Liang Mengqi ran and jumped as she chased after Mengmeng.Zhao Feng looked at her lively figure again and again.Seeing so many pet dogs, Yu Qingqing and Zhao Dahu also ran over while laughing.\u201cZhang Han, I really admire you from the bottom of my heart.\u201d Zhao Feng shook his head and sighed, then asked: \u201cWas this all built by you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow long did it take to build such a big place?\u201d Zhao Feng asked curiously.\u201cA few days.\u201d Zhang Han did not say that all of these modifications had only taken an hour.\u201cA few days\u2026\u201d Even so, Zhao Feng\u2019s expression still stiffened.His eyes swept the surroundings, saying, \u201cThe environment here is really good. So the ingredients we ate are all from here as well. The organic food is really delicious.\u201d\u201corganic?\u201d Zhang Han laughed softly, and said: \u201cThis place is way more complex than that.\u201d\u201cCould it be \u2026 What is the secret? \u201d Zhao Feng squinted his eyes.In the face of Zhao Feng\u2019s question, Zhang Han only indifferently shook his head.On this piece of land, there were fifth-stage spirit treasure s, second-stage spirit treasures, first stage pure Yang spirit treasure. Water, first grade spirit treasure meat. Team grass. Rank one spirit treasure, rank one Jade-fire dew. There were also spirit water, spiritual earth, and pleasant smell grass.With so many treasures gathered on this piece of land, how could it be normal?\u201cspectacular!\u201dZhao Feng sighed once again.He didn\u2019t know if it was because that Zhang Han created this spectacular place, or if it was because of the fatherly love.No matter what it was, Zhang Han\u2019s image in Zhao Feng\u2019s heart grew a little taller.\u201cZhang han, your place is so good, why aren\u2019t you taking care of it?\u201d \u201cSometimes, it would be a pity if a mountain climber were to come here and destroy it a little.\u201d Zhao Feng said with some doubt.\u201cwe have got Little Black?\u201d Zhang Han pursed his lips at Xiao Hei, and said: \u201cAs long as it exists, there won\u2019t be any problems with this territory. It\u2019s the little butler here, and is in charge of guarding and protecting my gate.\u201d\u201cIt \u2026\u201d Zhao Feng was startled for a moment, and then smiled with relief: \u201cBoss, where did you get this dog? This dog is really something, I actually felt a bit of a threat from him. \u201d\u201cThreats?\u201d Zhang Han shook his head slightly, and said: \u201cYou really might not be able to defeat it.\u201dAfter the transformation, the quality of Little black\u2019s body had become extremely good. If Zhao Feng did not use any blades and spears, Zhang Han would think that he would lose in a battle, but with a weapon, no matter how strong Little Black\u2019s body was, he would not be able to stop the attacks. Even the current Zhang Han was unable to do so.\u201cThis \u2026\u201d Zhao Feng shook his head and laughed bitterly.After Zhao Feng had interacted with Zhang Han, he realized that he was getting worse and worse. In the boss\u2019s eyes, Zhao Feng could not even beat one of his boss\u2019s dog, if these words were to spread, it would cause a huge commotion!\u2018It\u2019s not that I\u2019m getting worse, it\u2019s that Zhang Han is too strong\u2026 \u2018Zhao Feng shook his head and sighed.But even so, Zhao Feng still liked to come to Zhang Han\u2019s restaurant. The first reason was obviously because of the temptation of the food, and the second reason \u2026Just by looking at Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes that were gradually floating towards Liang Mengqi, one could tell that this fellow most likely had fallen in love with her.Once a boy had a favorable impression of a girl, he would definitely try to get close to her.After watching Mengmeng and the others play happily for a while, Zhang Han went to the farm land and dug up 4 big potatoes, 7 eggplants and some scallion flowers, and squeezed the milk properly. After finishing all of these, Zhang Han returned to the thunder yang trees, and looked around at his surroundings.\u201cDo you smoke?\u201d Zhao Feng took out a box of Marlboro and lit one for Zhang Han. Then, he lit one for himself.\u201cYou built this place so well.\u201d Zhao Feng praised once again.\u201cIs that so? It will be better here in the future. \u201d Zhang Han smiled faintly. The transformation of the Mount New Moon was only the beginning, and the second time would make the place different. The third time would make the Mount New Moon into a fairyland.\u201cI believe in you.\u201d Zhao Feng was deeply in agreement, but after that he changed the topic and said: \u201cI came to Mount New Moon half a year ago, and at that time, this place was still a forest. Zhang Han had created this place to be like this, if the people from the Bureau of Lands were to find out, it would be troublesome.\u201dAfter Zhang Han heard this, his gaze paused for a moment. He lightly shook his head, and spoke with an unquestionable tone, with the aura of a king looking down at the world:\u201cNobody can give orders in my, Zhang Han\u2019s territory?\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s fingers suddenly trembled, and he lowered his head slightly. His eyes flickered, and for a moment, he was pressured by Zhang Han\u2019s imposing aura to the point that he was unable to breathe.But thankfully, after Zhang Han finished speaking, the aura also dissipated. His gaze landed on the large fish pond, and he said:\u201cWhat are the more delicious fish kinds?\u201d\u201cFish?\u201d Zhao Feng was slightly stunned, but after thinking for a moment, he answered: There are a lot of different kinds, such as grass carp, silver carp, green carp, carp, three scales, crucian carp, etc. I usually eat three scales, and also mud loach.There are also sea fishes, such as yellow croaker, sardines, eels, fish, black fish, all of them are pretty good, in short, if the fish is cooked well, I think they are all very delicious, and I even ate a puffer fish once, and the taste was very good, but the puffer fish are very poisonous, and they have very strict requirements on hand, and there is also the saying \u2018eat puffer fish to the death\u2019, there are too many types of fish, I still have many that I haven\u2019t tasted before.Zhao Feng explained everything he knew about fish.Liked it?

Zhao Feng, do you know where I can buy these shrimp seeds?\u201d\u201cShrimp seeds?\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes lit up, and said: \u201cHan, are you planning to raise fish here? Hmm \u2026 Was this pond salt water or fresh water? If it\u2019s salt water, it can only raise some seafish, but if it\u2019s fresh water, it can only raise freshwater fish. \u201d\u201cMy pond here can raise anything.\u201d Zhang Han smiled lightly.\u201cEh \u2026\u201d The muscles on Zhao Feng\u2019s face trembled, and he did not say anything else.He could even feel a threat from the dogs on the mountain, so this place was not someplace that could be judged by common sense. It was still a little impossible for Zhao Feng to believe that it is possible to raise freshwater fishes and sea fishes in a same pond.\u201cHan is preparing to raise fish. Doesn\u2019t that mean that we\u2019ll be able to eat fish food soon?\u201d Zhao Feng finally realized that, thus he couldn\u2019t help but say in an excited tone, \u201chan, leave the matter of the fish seeds to me.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dZhang Han pondered for a moment, then nodded, and said: \u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll be troubling you with this matter.\u201dAs he spoke, Zhang Han raised his arm and lightly patted Zhao Feng\u2019s shoulder. This kind of attitude, seemed to be like that an elder was encouraging a junior, or someone with a high status encouraging someone with a low status.\u201cNo trouble, no trouble at all \u2026\u201dHowever, Zhao Feng didn\u2019t mind at all. He was like a student who had gotten a prize, and grinned.If this scene was seen by the Forever Harmony Association or other people from the underground powers.That would definitely overturn their view of the him.Since when did a madman whose name shook the world become so amiable?In the afternoon, everyone spent three hours in Mount New Moon. It was like they had forgotten the time.It was already 5: 30 when they returned to the restaurant. Although the notice board said that the restaurant was open for business from 18.00 to 19.00, the customers seemed to have arrived earlier and earlier. This was because every time they arrived at the restaurant according to the schedule, they would have to queue for more than half an hour.\u201cMengmeng, come, let little sis hug you.\u201dIn front of the restaurant, Liang Mengqi felt that she was close to Mengmeng, so she stretched out her arms and smiled. She had wanted to hug the beautiful little princess for a long time.\u201cHmm hah, no, that can\u2019t be, PaPa doesn\u2019t allow Mengmeng to be hugged by others.\u201d Mengmeng was a little shy as she twisted her body to answer.\u201cLittle sis is also not an outsider, of course I can hug you.\u201d Liang Mengqi laughed.\u201cEh?\u201d Mengmeng raised her little head and looked at PaPa, wondering if she would let her little sister hug him.Seeing that, Liang Mengqi looked at Zhang Han who was about to open the door, and asked: \u201cZhang Han, do you think I am an outsider?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han replied cleanly without even turning his head.Liang Mengqi\u2019s expression became stiff on the spot. Yu Qingqing, as well as Zhao Dahu, were both holding back their laughter.\u201cHumph!\u201dLiang Mengqi loudly snorted, and snappily said: \u201cBoss, you hurt my heart.\u201dSaying that, Liang Mengqi\u2019s heart became anxious. These words sounded like the owner was her boyfriend.\u201cYou want to bankrupt Zhang Han by eating in here? \u201d Zhao Dahu said as his mouth twitched.It seemed that the more she ate, the more money the boss would earn.\u201cWho cares?\u201d Liang Mengqi glared at Zhao Dahu, and suddenly saw Zhao Feng laughing, she rolled her eyes at him, and said: \u201cWhat are you laughing at!\u201d\u201cI \u2026\u201d Zhao Feng was speechless.It was one thing for her to judge others when she talked, but now, others couldn\u2019t even stand by and laugh. Where was the justice in this!?Zhang Han entered the dining hall and played some music before preparing for dinner in the kitchen.First, he cooked the rice. After the rice was cooked, Zhang Han opened the lid of the pot.During this break, Zhang Han prepared to cook.For dinner, Zhang Han planned to make stir-fried potato shredded egg and red-braised eggplant.Operating normally, Zhang Han first peeled off the potato skin, causing a wave of blade light to flash.\u201cBang, bang, bang, bang \u2026\u201dAn orderly and quick knocking sound came out, causing everyone to look over, only to see that the potatoes had been sliced, and Zhang Han had started to cut them into pieces.From a distance, everyone could see that Zhang Han knife technique was as good as a cutting tool.There were tools in the kitchen as well, but Zhang Han did not use them. In the afternoon, when he was checking how to make potato chips, he realized that some people said that hand-cut potato beans were even more delicious than those cut by tools. They said it in a serious manner, whether it was true or not, Zhang Han would do as they said.There were quite a few flavors of potato beans. This time, Zhang Han planned to make a spicy potato beans, but the spicy degree would definitely be lower, since the dish was mainly for Mengmeng to eat. Mengmeng was still small, so she could not eat it too spicy.While Zhang Han was cooking, guests gathered in front of the restaurant.\u201cBam.\u201dSun Dongheng got off his BMW Z4, and stood beside the car, he looked at the street, and after seeing that there were no cars in sight, Sun Dongheng shook his head and sighed, he took out his restaurant membership card, looked at it, and gently caressed it, then carefully put it back in his wallet.During this time, a few people in the line in front of the restaurant saw Sun Dongheng\u2019s actions.\u201cSee what he\u2019s got in his hand? \u201cThat\u2019s the membership card for this restaurant.\u201d\u201cOh my god, a rich person. The membership here is worth a million apiece.\u201d\u201cI heard that they\u2019ve already sold seven or eight of them. If the top ten are sold out, then people will have to spend ten million to buy one.\u201dIf it was a normal situation, when Sun Dongheng saw this scene, he would definitely be overjoyed. This sort of silent posturing was his favorite.However, he didn\u2019t seem to care about it right now. He was just looking at the side of the street.Finally, the car he was waiting for arrived. It was an Audi A8L, and as he watched, the car slowly stopped at the side of the BMW Z4.Sun Ming and Sun\u2019s mother got off.\u201cDad, Mom.\u201d Sun Dongheng called out.\u201cYes.\u201d Sun Ming remained expressionless as he nodded his head slightly. He looked at the restaurant plate and said: \u201cThere are quite a number of people queuing up, looks like the food here should be quite good.\u201d\u201cNot only just good, this is my first time eating such a delicious meal, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have given you a membership card.\u201d The Sun\u2019s mother smiled and said: \u201cIn the future, our family will come here to eat.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s try it first.\u201d Sun Ming laughed as he shook his head.He was very busy recently and felt that he didn\u2019t have much time left. Before this, he needed to settle the company\u2019s matters properly, and decided whether Sun\u2019s mother and Sun Dongheng could directly take over the company or they could just directly sell the company. It was just that Sun Dongheng\u2019s immaturity made him extremely anxious.Under the envious gaze of the crowd, the three walked into the dining hall and took their member seats.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty good.\u201d Sun Ming looked at the surroundings.It was clean and tidy. Soft music surrounded his ears. In addition, there were not many customers in the restaurant. No one shouted loudly.Putting aside the taste of the food, just based on the environment, Sun Ming felt that the quality of the restaurant was much better.Soon, the food was ready.Although Sun Dongheng didn\u2019t say it out loud, he still helped his father fill half of the Egg-Fried Rice and a bowl of rice and vegetables.\u201cDad, try the Egg Fried Rice first.\u201d Sun Dongheng smiled and said.\u201cAlright.\u201dSun Ming slightly nodded. When he ate the first mouthful of Egg-Fried Rice, his expression suddenly froze, and even his eyes became a little blurry.After that, he took a second and third bite and finished half of the Egg-Fried Rice. Then, Sun Ming started to eat the plain white rice again.With a single mouthful, the pure fragrance of the white rice made Sun Ming\u2019s taste buds feel extremely satisfied.Rice, of course, was also grown in pure green and in bulk. In farmers\u2019 homes, farmers would always grow some pure green rice for their own consumption.The rice that they were prepared to sell would also be sprinkled with medicine and other supplementary items, which would increase their output by a lot, and the rice that they ate at home, would taste good when they cooked it, it would be fragrant and tender, not to mention the rice that was grown in the Mount New Moon.Sun Ming began to eat the rice in small bites. Upon seeing this, Sun Dongheng reminded him, \u201cDad, don\u2019t just eat the rice, try out the dishes cooked by the owner, they\u2019re really delicious.\u201d\u201cOh right, try it.\u201d Sun Ming smiled at his son.There was no doubt that the potato chips and braised eggplant, about their appearance or taste, had reached their peak, allowing Sun Ming to understand his son\u2019s thoughts.This kind of delicacy really had to be savored and eaten seriously! This was the supreme enjoyment of taste buds.After the fragrant meal, Sun Ming\u2019s family drank some milk and prepared to take a rest for a while.At this time, Sun Ming couldn\u2019t help but look at Zhang Han and Mengmeng.The two of them had finished their meal and were currently turning off the music. They were sitting in front of the piano with their hands clasped together.\u201cPaPa, mm\u2026 Mengmeng remembered it all, PaPa, take your hands away\u2026 \u201d\u201cAlright, alright, alright. Dad will watch Mengmeng play.\u201dSeeing this scene, Sun Ming\u2019s heart trembled, and he remembered the scene when he and his son were young.He had interacted with Sun Dongheng like this before too. At that time, he was still nestling in his embrace and calling him daddy.He still remembered that when Sun Dongheng was young, he would always call his father Superman, because at that time, his father knew everything.Gradually, Sun Dongheng grew up a bit, and would always tell Sun Ming: \u201cDad, in the future, your son will buy a large villa for your mom and dad to stay in.\u201dAfter that, Sun Ming began to busy himself with his own business. He spent less time with Sun Dongheng, but the anticipation he had for him in his heart did not decrease at all.Liked it?

When they get older, parents will feel happy when their children are safe and often go home to visit.At this moment, a series of images of Sun Dongheng\u2019s childhood, youth, etc. floated past Sun Ming\u2019s mind.\u201cIn a blink of an eye, Dong Heng has grown up \u2026\u201dSun Ming sighed, turned his head to look at Sun Dongheng, smiled slightly, and said: \u201cDong Heng, you are the man in the family, your father\u2019s attitude towards you has been bad, and this is your father\u2019s mistake, but your father hopes that you can become a useful person, and I hope that you can become a good man. Seeing you in such a state makes your father feel anxious.\u201dAfter Sun Dongheng heard this, his eyes became serious, and felt his heart tremble.He could\u2019t believe that father actually admitted that he was wrong\u2026In that moment, Sun Dongheng\u2019s heart became complicated, he looked at his father who had already started to have white hair, and his eyes instantly turned wet.He quickly lowered his head, controlled his emotions, and said with a choked voice:\u201cDad, it\u2019s my fault. I\u2019ve always made you angry \u2026\u201dA look of reluctance appeared in Sun Ming\u2019s eyes, he laughed, extended his hand and caressed Sun Dongheng\u2019s head, then stood up and patted his shoulder, and said: \u201cAlright, this meal is very happy, let\u2019s go back.\u201dThe three of them stood up and went over to the counter of the laptop. At this time, Zhang Han was still playing the piano.\u201cDad, don\u2019t disturb the boss, just leave the money here.\u201dWhile speaking, Sun Dongheng had already placed a small stack of bills on the counter.\u201cDon\u2019t you need to show it to the boss?\u201d Sun Ming asked suspiciously.\u201cNo need, other than buying the membership cards, the rest of the time the money is all left here.\u201d Sun Dongheng replied.\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Sun Ming laughed, he looked at Zhang Han strangely, then turned and walked out.Just as he was about to get on the carriage, Sun\u2019s mother muttered to himself: \u201cAh Ming, Dong Heng is preparing to go to the shopping mall later. Why don\u2019t we go take a look as well? \u201cOur family hasn\u2019t been shopping together for a long time. We could go to buy some clothes for you.\u201d\u201cGo shopping?\u201d Sun Ming was startled, he was moved, but after considering it, he shook his head and said: \u201cYou guys can go take a look, I still have some work to take care of today, so I will not go.\u201d\u201cThis \u2026\u201d Sun\u2019s mother sighed, and said: \u201cAlright then.\u201d\u201cEn, Dong Heng, accompany your mother for a walk. Dad will be going back first.\u201d Sun Ming waved his hand towards Sun Dongheng.\u201cAlright.\u201dUnder the gazes of the two, Sun Ming got on the car and slowly left.Sun Dongheng brought his mother to the shopping mall, buying a few sets of clothes. After shopping, Sun Dongheng drove his mother back to the main residence District.\u201cMom, since I\u2019m giving this to you, I won\u2019t be going in.\u201d Sun Dongheng said as he drank some milk tea and took out a few clothing bags from the trunk.At this time, Sun\u2019s mother had a complicated expression on her face. since she started eating in the dining hall, she had been remaining silence.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Mom? \u201cAre you feeling uncomfortable somewhere?\u201d Sun Dongheng asked.\u201cNo \u2026\u201d Sun\u2019s mother shook her head with difficulty and took the clothing bag from Sun Dongheng\u2019s hands.\u201cThen I\u2019m leaving.\u201d Sun Dongheng drank his milk tea and waved to prepare to get on the car.\u201cDong Heng!\u201d Just as he was about to get on the car, the his mother suddenly shouted.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Mom, is there something wrong? \u201d Sun Dongheng was slightly taken aback.\u201cYou \u2026\u201dHis mother hesitated for a while before gritting her teeth and saying, \u201cYour father \u2026 he \u2026 he has cancer \u2026\u201dBOOM!Sun Dongheng was stunned still for a moment as if he had been struck by lightning.Bang!The milk teacup in his hand fell to the ground, his mind full of his father\u2019s figure.\u2026\u2026At seven in the morning the next day,\u2019s restaurant had guests who had already arrived one after another.In just a few days, Mengmeng\u2019s casual restaurant had gained a small reputation here. The people from the few restaurants next door had already seen the hotness of Zhang Han\u2019s restaurant, and at dinner time, the thirty small chairs in front of the restaurant would all be occupied, and there were even times when there were long queues.This scene was enough to show how good the business was.And every time Zhang Han cooked, he would fill up the rice pot and the daily turnover would be over forty thousand. After a month, it would be very easy to earn more than a million.With so many people, the speed of eating rice had also increased. The two bags of rice were almost empty.\u201cEh? \u201cBoss, what are you doing?\u201dLiang Mengqi asked curiously as she walked in.\u201cUgh \u2026\u201d PaPa is braiding Mengmeng\u2019s hair. \u201d Mengmeng sat very straight on the sofa with her small body, allowing Zhang Han to freely play with her hair.\u201comg \u2026\u201dAs she walked over, she said, \u201cBoss, the plait is not like that, it\u2019s just that Mengmeng is pretty. If you are doing this to a different child, the child is gonna look bad. Boss, I finally found out that you\u2019re clumsy, hehe, let\u2019s see what I\u2019ll do, you better learn well!\u201dLiang Mengqi said while grinning, as she extended her hands out to take over Zhang Han\u2019s position.When Zhang Han handed the comb over to her, they couldn\u2019t avoid to touch each other.Just this one strike made Liang Mengqi feel like she was electrocuted. For some reason, she started to panic in her heart, as if her little face was a little hot.\u201cIt seems that I should learn how to braid my hair.\u201dOn the other hand, Zhang Han didn\u2019t mind. She smiled lightly and said: \u201cMengmeng\u2019s hair grows quite fast.\u201cHmm hah, Mengmeng wants a long hair. Let PaPa plait Mengmeng\u2019s hair.\u201d Mengmeng chuckled.\u201cNonsense.\u201d Liang Mengqi\u2019s beautiful eyes contained love. She looked at Zhang Han and said, \u201cMengmeng\u2019s hair is already rather long now.\u201cEh \u2026\u201d Zhang Han laughed.\u201cMengmeng, what hairstyle do you want?\u201d Liang Mengqi asked.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d I like Mickey Mouse, he has two balls. \u201d Mengmeng said as she drew a circle with her little finger.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s see how big sister will get you a beautiful Mickey Mouse hairstyle.\u201dLiang Mengqi smiled and started to tidy up Mengmeng\u2019s hair.Zhang Han watched on the side. Liang Mengqi\u2019s hands were very flexible as she made sure that all the strands of Mengmeng\u2019s hair were neatly tied up, with both sides of her head coiled into two balls. After tying them up with a hair rope, she combed Mengmeng\u2019s bangs to the side.\u201cHow about it?\u201d Liang Mengqi took a mirror from the tea table.\u201cWow, so cute\u2026 \u201cHehehe \u2026\u201d Mengmeng was overjoyed for a moment.\u201cBoss, hmph, take a look at my skills. In the future, learn from me.\u201d Liang Mengqi was very happy, her eyes were full of smiles, and even her tone was a little charming.This scene was witnessed by Yu Qingqing, Zhao Dahu and Zhao Feng who were seated at the side.\u201cSigh, it\u2019s over, I\u2019m afraid Mengqi is going to fall in love with the boss.\u201d Zhao Dahu shook his head and sighed: \u201cEven Mengqi is about to step into the river of love. Qing Qing, when are we going to \u2026\u201d\u201cshut up!\u201dYu Qingqing rolled her eyes at him, looked at Zhang Han, and said: \u201cLooks like Mengqi really has a good impression of the boss, hahaha, this is so good, if she was with the boss, wouldn\u2019t we have the privilege to eat whenever we wanted to?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, hehe.\u201d Zhao Dahu\u2019s eyes lit up as he smiled.However, Zhao Feng, who was beside him, was not happy at all. There was still a little bit of disappointment in his heart.He liked Liang Mengqi, but it seemed that Liang Mengqi had fallen for the boss, and the boss was so outstanding, it made Zhao Feng sigh repeatedly in his heart.As for Zhang Han, his gaze was constantly staring at Mengmeng. Seeing her happy hairstyle, Zhang Han had already planned to study her hairstyle in the future.\u201cBoss, why did you think of giving Mengmeng a hairstyle today? \u201d Liang Mengqi asked somewhat curiously.Just as Zhang Han was about to answer, Mengmeng had already opened her mouth:\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Because Mama will be back today, Mama will be back, Mengmeng wants something beautiful, PaPa wants something handsome. \u201dLiang Mengqi\u2019s smile froze. She looked at Zhang Han and said: \u201cBoss, didn\u2019t you and Mengmeng\u2019s mother separate?\u201dAt this time, Zhang Han slightly smiled, looked at Liang Mengqi and said: \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re separated, it\u2019s that we\u2019re not together yet.\u201dPaPa and Mama are together. PaPa will sleep together at the Mama family\u2019s place, we will eat together, hmm\u2026 Every day, you still have to talk over the phone for a long time, Mengmeng and Mama have less and less time to talk. \u201d Mengmeng said with her sweet voice.Her words stunned Liang Mengqi.Together, sleeping together, eating together, and making calls everyday \u2026A series of imformations. In Liang Mengqi\u2019s opinion, they looked like a loving couple!\u201cPaPa, Mengmeng is hungry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll cook now. I\u2019ll be ready soon.\u201d Zhang Han laughed as he touched Mengmeng\u2019s head, then turned and walked towards the kitchen.Liang Mengqi returned to the dining table in a daze.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Mengqi?\u201d Yu Qingqing saw that she was a little absent-minded and asked.\u201cQingqing.\u201d When Liang Mengqi came back to her conscious, she felt a little disappointed in her heart. People could even tell from the tone of her voice,\u201dthe boos is with his wife and they love each other so much\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be?\u201d Yu Qingqing raised her eyebrows, glanced at Zhang Han who was busying himself in the kitchen and said softly: \u201cThe boss said it himself last time. He said that he and Mengmeng\u2019s mother were not married.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s going on?\u201d Zhao Dahu said as he frowned.At this time, Zhao Feng\u2019s mood was a little carefree, but his calm expression did not allow anyone to see through his mood. He pondered for a moment and said: \u201cThe marriage certificate is only piece of paper, that even if you are not married, you can still love each other and have children, is there something that the boss cannot say? The boss is not an ordinary person. If he is a descendant of a big family, it\u2019s possible that he could escape and be with his beloved. \u201dLiked it?

Have you ever seen a normal person not even look at the money when everyone is paying?\u201d He is definitely from a big family! \u201d Yu Qingqing\u2019s eyes gradually lit up, and said: \u201cWow, that must be it. For love, the boss gave up on his name, gave up on his status as a successor of an aristocratic family, and came out alone to be with the landlady. Wow, so romantic, so touching!\u201dLittle did Yu Qingqing know that her words had made a bad influence on Mengqi\u2019s heart. She unhappily rolled her eyes at Yu Qingqing and said: \u201cEnough, aren\u2019t you tired of saying so much?\u201d\u201cEh \u2026\u201d Yu Qingqing reacted and laughed awkwardly: \u201cMengqi, handsome men are everywhere? since the boss has been taken, then let\u2019s change targets. I think that Zhao Feng is not bad.\u201dYu Qingqing\u2019s sudden words made Zhao Feng\u2019s body tighten. His expression was very calm, but his body was straightened without being noticed.\u201cAlright. Then you two should be together! Humph! Don\u2019t talk nonsense and just wait for the meal! \u201d Liang Mengqi was a little depressed.Her good mood was completely wrecked by the news, Liang Mengqi pouted and became a little absent-minded.Even when the food was ready, Liang Mengqi had almost forgotten to stood up to fill the bowl before Yu Qingqing reminded her.It was just a small accident, and people ate as usual.After Zhang Han and Mengmeng finished their meal, he carried Mengmeng to the sofa to watch an cartoon.As soon as he turned on the TV, a handsome man, with a head full of black hair, wearing a suit jacket, white shirt and tie, and looking like an business elite, walked in.His eyes were red and swollen, his face was slightly pale, he was Sun Dongheng.\u201cBoss, can I pack four servings of rice? My parents are rather busy, so they can\u2019t come here. I want to bring them food. \u201d Sun Dongheng\u2019s voice was hoarse, his mental state terrible.\u201cSure.\u201d Zhang Han nodded.\u201cThank you, boss. Oh yes, this is a gift my father brought to Mengmeng.\u201d Sun Dongheng picked up the bag in his hands, his eyes reddened slightly as he said: \u201cYesterday, after eating dinner here, my family was very happy, and my relationship with my father was also getting better. Thank you, boss, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that we were eating here, I really don\u2019t know when our relationship would be able to get better, thank you, thank you.\u201dIf not for the fact that he ate here, if it wasn\u2019t for Sun Ming admitting to his fault, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that Sun\u2019s mother had told him the secret that was hidden in her heart, then Sun Dongheng felt that he would regret it for his entire life.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d What gift is it? \u201d Mengmeng\u2019s clear eyes looked at the package, which seemed to contain her favorite toys.\u201cIt\u2019s a remote control car and a remote control plane.\u201d Sun Dongheng revealed an ugly smile.\u201cMm, no need to be polite. Go and fill the bowl with food.\u201d Zhang Han took the gift and handed it over to the happy Mengmeng.Sun Dongheng nodded, and turned to fill the bowl with rice.\u201cThank you, little big brother \u2026\u201d When Sun Dongheng was about to leave, Mengmeng waved her arms at him smilingly.\u201cPaPa, Mengmeng wants to play with the remote control car.\u201d Mengmeng said somewhat anxiously.\u201cDad put the battery on.\u201d Zhang Han opened the remote control car and installed the battery of the car and the remoter.After finishing this, he handed the remoterl over to Mengmeng.\u201cBeep Beep Beep \u2026\u201d Mmm mmm\u2026 \u201cBe careful, I \u2026 I\u2019m going to turn around \u2026\u201dIn Yunyin Garden, Mengmeng had become very proficient at playing with the remote control cars, but because of receiving the new toy, Mengmeng was very happy anyway.After Mengmeng played around for a while, the restaurant\u2019s morning business ended.Liang Mengqi, Yu Qingqing and Zhao Dahu greeted each other and left as usual. Zhao Feng sat on the chair and waited for Zhang Han.Half an hour later, Zhang Han finally stood up and walked towards Zhao Feng. Without waiting for Zhang Han to speak, he said:\u201cI\u2019ve asked around about the fish seedlings. According to the you, there are both freshwater fish and saltwater fish. My friends have given me a detailed plan and have already made an order for the shrimp seedlings to be delivered to the mountain tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOh? \u201cSo fast?\u201d Zhang Han was startled, he did not expect Zhao Feng\u2019s work to be so efficient.\u201cOf course, since I work for you, I will naturally do my best. After all, I\u2019m also a glutton.\u201d Zhao Feng shook his head and laughed.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han laughed, then looked outside the window: \u201cThe car is ready \u201d\u201cWhat car?\u201d Zhao Feng turned his head suspiciously, his gaze sweeping the place before finally landing on the car parked slowly in front of the dining hall.\u201cModified panda?\u201dZhao Feng could immediately tell that this car had been modified. The front face of the car looked more like a panda, and on the front of the car was a drawing of a panda lying on the ground. The body of the car was crystal white, while the two goggles were black, their shapes were slightly adjusted, like the ears of a panda.However, overall, the car\u2019s appearance was a bit more cute and beautiful than before, but there wasn\u2019t anything special about her either. She was simple, clean, and cute, and that was her appearance\u2019s characteristic.However, if one did not enter the car, they would definitely not be able to discover the luxurious arrangement inside.The car stopped, and a middle-aged man got off. This man was the technical master who had previously talked with Zhang Han, and when the tip is good enough, the man had modified the car over nights and had personally it delivered.\u201cMr. Zhang.\u201d The technician smiled warmly as he came in. He handed over the folder in his hand and said, \u201cThis is the car\u2019s documents and this is the car\u2019s key. Mr. Zhang, please check it out to see if there is any problems.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to check, you can go back.\u201d Zhang Han casually waved his hand.\u201cAlright sir, then. If you have any problems with the car, please feel free to contact me.\u201d The craftsman said politely, then turned around and left.\u201cBoss, why did you buy a Panda?\u201d Zhao Feng was a little puzzled as he replied, \u201cI think that only a luxurious car can match your identity.\u201d\u201cBecause Mengmeng likes it.\u201d Zhang Han replied indifferently.Zhao Feng\u2019s expression froze for a moment, then he lightly shook his head and said: \u201cBoss, you are really the kindest father.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not afraid that she is spoiled\u201d Zhang Han laughed.With these words, Zhao Feng didn\u2019t know what to say, and could only praise and admire him from the bottom of his heart.\u201cGet someone to help me get the Wrangler back.\u201d Zhang Han pointed to the Wrangler which had been driven for a few days.\u201cI\u2019ll send it off. I have nothing else to do, where can I send it off to?\u201d Zhao Feng stood up and asked.\u201cThe rental contract is on the car. The exact address is on it.\u201d Zhang Han handed over the car keys.\u201cAlright.\u201dZhao Feng took the car keys and turned to leave.After about an hour, Zhao Feng returned with a taxi and chatted with Zhang Han for a while. It was already noon.As usual, the people lining up more and more for lunch, also attracting the gazes of the people in the surrounding restaurants. They didn\u2019t understand why Mengmeng\u2019s casual restaurant would be so popular.They definitely couldn\u2019t stop feeling envy in their hearts, but there was nothing they could do about the food. After all, they couldn\u2019t interfere with the customers\u2019 choice.During lunch, Sun Dongheng came over and packaged four more meals. Liang Mengqi\u2019s mood had also eased up and she was chatting happily with Zhang Han.Since he had a family, she would do nothing and hide her feelings.In the afternoon, Zhang Han brought Mengmeng to the Mount New Moon. Today, not only did Zhang Li come over, Zi Yan returned as well.Zhang Han was very straightforward, he caught two hens, and picked beans, potatoes, eggplants, cucumbers, chives and chillies.Prepare chicken stewed potatoes, beans and eggplant, fried chili with eggs, and pull cucumber skins.Two chickens were obviously the main dish, while the others were equivalent to side dishes. Zhang Han did not doubt the taste of the Mount New Moon\u2019s chickens at all.If it was a common chicken that was usually bought, then it would be more than sufficient to make one, because although the chicken was tasty, it would not cause anyone to be enchanted with it.But, how could the chickens from Mount New Moon be ordinary? What\u2019s more, it\u2019s the chicken which had drunk Pure Yang Water before.The taste was unquestionable, so Zhang Han took two chickens, other than himself and Mengmeng, the other people who would be eating dinner at night would also be Zi Yan, Zhang Li and maybe Zhou Fei would come over too. If that was the case, four adults and one child, one chicken would definitely not be enough.Returning to the dining hall, Mengmeng sat on the sofa as she played with the remote control car. And Zhang Han went to the restaurant next door.\u201coh! Boss? Why are you here? \u201cHurry, hurry, please come in.\u201dWhen the manager saw Zhang Han, his body moved, he immediately rushed to the door and personally welcomed Zhang Han in, that kind of attitude, it could be said that he was extremely passionate, to the point that it made Xiao Mei feel that even when the manager\u2019s good brother came, he was not this enthusiastic!\u201cBoss, you \u2026\u201d The manager looked at the bag in Zhang Han\u2019s hands.\u201cCan you clean the chickens? I have two live chickens that I want to clean up. \u201d Zhang Han waved the bag in his hand.\u201cSure, leave it to me.\u201d The manager nodded with a smile, he received the bag from Zhang Han and handed it over to Xiao Mei: \u201cTell the kitchen to clean it up.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Xiao Mei looked at Zhang Han strangely a few times before carrying the bag to the kitchen.\u201cHow much is it?\u201d Zhang Han took out his wallet and asked.\u201cHey, clean up two chickens, isn\u2019t that a simple task! Boss, come over here, how can I have the nerve to ask you to pay? If you are embarrassed, then that \u2026 \u201d The manager was a little embarrassed, he looked around at his surroundings, then moved in front of Zhang Han and whispered: \u201cWhat do you think of me? How about I go to your restaurant and be the reception manager? \u201dAfter Zhang Han heard this, he could not help but chuckle.Liked it?

After eating the meal a few times, he couldn\u2019t help but have the urge to work there.Zhang Han understood his thoughts as a glutton, but he still shook his head and said: \u201cI do not need a manager for my restaurant. Just send the chicken over to me when you are done cleaning up.\u201dIn the end, Zhang Han left a hundred yuan at the counter, which was more than enough to pay for the work.The kitchen of the restaurant.\u201clittle Li, Little White, clean up these two chickens.\u201d Little Mei handed the bag over.\u201cWhose chicken is it?\u201d little Li asked.\u201cIt\u2019s from a customer, it\u2019s the boss of the Mengmeng restaurant next door. Clean it up carefully, don\u2019t fool around.\u201d After saying that, Little Mei turned around and left.\u201cShe felt so comfortable to give orders.\u201d Little White sneered as he looked at the back of Litlle Mei.\u201cHmph, other than the two of us, who else can she give orders to?\u201d little Li snorted lightly and grabbed the bag, saying unhappily: \u201cLet\u2019s work first!\u201dAfter that, he opened the bag, killed the chicken, and boiled some hot water to prepare the skin the feather.\u201cLittle White, look at these two chickens. Their fur is so good, and they\u2019re so smooth. They look pretty good.\u201d little Li let out a light cry.\u201cThis chicken must have weighed six pounds, right? It\u2019s as good as a feed chicken. \u201d Lil \u2018White lifted it up a few times and said.\u201cLet\u2019s weigh it out.\u201dThe little Li was a little curious and put the chicken in his hand on the weighing.\u201cSix point seven pounds, the chicken was raised so good?\u201d The little Li said.\u201cTake a look at this one. It weighs 6.8 pounds. omg. It\u2019s heavy!\u201d Lil \u2018White said as it weighed the chicken in his hand.\u201cLet\u2019s clean it up first.\u201dlittle Li said, he placed the chicken into an iron bowl and poured hot water into it to heat the feather. After the two of them put on their gloves, they started to process the chicken feathers.After handling it, little Li pinched the chicken a few times.\u201cEh? This chicken is so heavy, but it\u2019s not fat. This chicken is really well raised! It must be very delicious to eat it! \u201d little Li asked in shock.\u201cYeah, the meat quality of this chicken is way better than those man-feed chicken.\u201d Little White remembered the deliciousness when they were eating chicken and subconsciously swallowed his saliva. He said, \u201clittle Li, how about\u2026\u201dLittle White directly gave the little Li a look that could only be understood but not spoken out.Seeing that, little Li understood, he lowered his head and muttered, after a moment, he raised his head, and said: \u201cLeaving one behind, right? \u201cIf Both of them are switched. People will get suspicious, and the guest brought two chickens over here together. They\u2019ll probably be stewed together, and if we only switch one, he can\u2019t tell.\u201d\u201cAlright! Then we switch one.\u201d Little white grinned and said, \u201cThen shouldn\u2019t you tell the head chef? With such a good chicken, if he were to make it, it would probably be extremely delicious. \u201d\u201cI think I will\u201d little Li squinted, and said while laughing.Just as the two of them finished discussing, the head chef was coming over, the head chef walked past them.\u201cStill busy during the break time?\u201d The head chef said as he looked at the two of them.\u201cOf course not. These are the two chickens that the guests sent over. Little Mei, let us clean up.\u201d Lil \u2018White answered.\u201cIs this a home-kept chicken?\u201d The head chef was stunned. He could not tell, so he reached out his hand and said, \u201cLet me have a look.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Lil \u2018White responsed and handed the chicken over.The head chef pressed the body of the chicken a few times before his eyes lit up and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a home-kept chicken. Not bad, not bad, this meat is of the highest quality. This chicken is the best amongst chickens, but this is the first time I\u2019ve seen such a good chicken.The Head Chef could tell that this chicken was not ordinary. If he were to make it, the smell would definitely make the Head Chef unforgettable.\u201cHehehe.\u201d little Li smiled and said, \u201cAbout that \u2026 Brother Wang, he sent us two chickens, why don\u2019t we switch one of them? \u201cAnd we can improve our food tonight?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dThe head chef raised his eyebrows, casually threw the chicken back into the pot, glared at little Li, and without saying anything, turned around and left.\u201cWhat does Brother Wang mean by this?\u201d Little white whispered after the head chef left.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point? \u201cHaha, that duck we exchanged the day before yesterday, he didn\u2019t say anything either? He even cooked it himself, and it\u2019s so delicious! Tidy up quickly, let\u2019s leave one for tonight to improve the food!\u201d little Li said while laughing.\u201cAlright.\u201d Little \u2018White started working happily.The two chickens were quickly cleaned up. Little white grabbed a meat chicken from the side and handed the two chickens over to Little Mei with a bag.Little Mei carried the bag and walked to the manager.\u201cManager, I\u2019m sending these two chickens to the boss next door.\u201d\u201cNo need, no need, I\u2019ll send them off.\u201dThe manager hurriedly said that before taking the bag and leaving.At this time, in Zhang Han\u2019s restaurant, Mengmeng turned on the television after playing with the remote control for a while.Zhang Han was in the kitchen wiping down the counter.\u201cBoss, the chicken is ready.\u201d After the manager walked in, he smiled warmly and placed the bag on the counter. \u201cBoss, do you really not want to think about me? Being a manager here will definitely increase the restaurant\u2019s turnover by ten times, and will also make the boss\u2019s restaurant famous throughout Xiang Jiang, oh no, it will also make the boss\u2019s restaurant become famous all over the world, I worked in the restaurant next door where I worked for half a year, that restaurant is just a normal restaurant, I have even doubled the restaurant\u2019s turnover, the rice here is so unrivalled, believe in me, I can definitely make it happen, boss, give me a chance! \u201dThe manager said all this in one breath, his heart full of sincerity.As a successful person in management, his dream was to become a manager in a star restaurant. However, after entering society from university, he realized that was not the case. A diploma was just a piece of paper.Not to mention entering a star restaurant, even some high-end restaurants couldn\u2019t accept him in. How many people squeezed their brains out waiting in line?However, right now, the manager really wanted to work at Zhang Han\u2019s restaurant, it had nothing to do with money. Zhang Han\u2019s delicacies, made him impressed, he had never eaten such a delicious meal, he was confident that if he were to do it, with the publicity, within half a year, the restaurant would become a star restaurant!But the boss didn\u2019t seem to have that kind of thought. He didn\u2019t seem to have any interest in making money, and every time he asked the customer to place the money on the counter, the owner would look like someone who didn\u2019t even care about the money.Seeing the manager\u2019s eager gaze, Zhang Han could not help but smile and said: \u201cIf I need it in the future, I will consider it.\u201d\u201cEh \u2026\u201d The manager sighed in his heart and said, \u201cAlright then, boss. If there is any chance, you have to call me. I definitely won\u2019t let you down. I\u2019ll go back first. I\u2019ll come over for dinner tonight.\u201dAfter saying that, the manager turned around and left. Just as he arrived at the door, a calm voice suddenly came from behind:\u201cWait.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d The manager turned to look at Zhang Han, and asked suspiciously: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong boss?\u201dWith that, the manager turned and walked back, and looked at Zhang Han puzzledly.\u201cTake this chicken back.\u201d Zhang Han pointed to the chicken on the right side of the chopping board and said, \u201cBring my original one back.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Hearing that, the manager was startled, he looked at the chicken that Zhang Han pointed to, and said: \u201cThe chicken was changed? It can\u2019t be? These two look like they\u2019re just cleaned up. \u201dZhang Han did not reply him, taking out two knives from the sheath on his back, at the same time, he gently cut down on the two chickens.\u201cBang bang.\u201dTwo muffled sounds rang out as the left side of the chicken was cut, and the knife was stuck in the middle, while the right side of the chicken was easily cut in half.Zhang Han used very little strength while the chicken on the right was cut off directly, which meant that the chicken\u2019s bones were much softer compared to another.The manager naturally understood the difference between a feed meat chicken and a home-kept chicken. After seeing this scene, the manager\u2019s face immediately turned red.\u201cThis, this, this \u2026\u201d The manager felt extremely ashamed. At this moment, he felt ashamed in front of his boss.\u201cI, I, I don\u2019t know. Boss, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll deal with it right now.\u201d The manager\u2019s face was full of bitterness. He picked up the chicken and ran away.After exiting the room, the manager\u2019s expression became extremely angry, and his heart was set on fire with anger.In the business world, honesty is the most important thing. The boss trusted him so much that he left the chicken and went back to his restaurant without concern. Yet, the restaurant he managed did something like this, how could he not be angry!The manager walked back to the restaurant with big strides. He ignored little Mei, who wanted to say something, and went straight to the kitchen.\u201cGet the fuck over here!\u201d The manager roared.The chefs, including the head chef, all walked over with a strange expression on their faces. This seemed to be the first time the manager had gotten angry.However, when little Li and Little White saw the manager\u2019s appearance and the meat chicken in his hands, their expressions shrunk as they slowly moved to the back side.\u201cWho cleaned the chicken?\u201d The manager clenched his teeth as he spoke.At this moment, the entire plaza was silent. Even Little Mei was silent. If she were to say the names of the two people, it would be unavoidable for her to offend them.\u201cWho is it!\u201d The manager shouted.\u201cYes\u2026 It\u2019s Little White and I. \u201d little Li knew that he could not hide anymore. He extended his hand and said timidly: \u201cSorry Manager, the both of us \u2026\u201dHe wanted to say that we might have taken the wrong chicken, but the words had not come out yet.\u201cWhiz!\u201dThe meat chicken suddenly flew over and smashed onto little Li\u2019s chest, interrupting his\u2019 excuse \u2018.\u201cYou are doing very well! Do you know how much of a disgrace this has caused our restaurant to lose? You guys are so shameless, but I\u2019m not shameless! The restaurant is not shameless! \u201d The manager said angrily, \u201cBring that chicken back to me!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Lil \u2018White\u2019s face shrunk as he quickly ran to the side and took the chicken from a drawer.The manager grabbed the chicken with his hands and walked out.At this time, everyone present let out a sigh of relief.When the usually amiable manager got angry, his aura was really strong. Seeing him leave, it might be because he did not want to pursue this matter. This made Xiao whitle and little Li feel at ease.But they were wrong.Liked it?

    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - The first ten membership cards were sold outPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euThe manager, who had just reached the door, turned around. He frowned as he looked at the two and said coldly,\u201cDoing business has always been about honesty. This kind of cheating is no longer suitable for this job. Go to the front desk and check your monthly salary. Both of you are fired!\u201dWith that, they two\u2019s expressions completely changed. They wanted to say something, but the manager didn\u2019t give them the chance and walked out in big strides.When he arrived at Zhang Han\u2019s restaurant, the manager\u2019s expression was somewhat bitter:\u201cBoss, I\u2019m really sorry. I didn\u2019t know that two newcomers from the kitchen had switched one.\u201d\u201cI have already fired them! This is truly unreasonable; I can\u2019t believe that they have done such a thing! \u201d\u201cThe employees of the restaurant are really disappointing!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSigh, I don\u2019t even want to work there anymore.\u201d\u201cCough cough, boss, why don\u2019t you reconsider me \u2026\u201dThe manager first indignantly said a few words, but very soon, the atmosphere gradually changed, and the manager once again expressed his desire to work in here.However, Zhang Han shook his head and rejected him. After a while, the manager gave up and shook his head helplessly as he turned to leave.However, the manager\u2019s heart had prepared to be repeatedly defeated. He firmly believed that as long as one\u2019s martial arts was profound; the iron pestle would be ground into a needle!He believed that one day he would make Zhang Han accept him.After the manager left, Zhang Han accompanied Mengmeng to watch the cartoon, and very quickly, it was 5: 30.This time, the first group of guests was an elderly couple, the man looked to be in his fifties, with a square face and wearing a Chinese tunic. Although his expression was kind, his body would inadvertently emit the aura of a superior.Beside him was a woman who looked younger than he did. Her hair was still very dark and her face was well maintained, but the lines at the corners of her eyes showed the signs of age.\u201cLiying, you\u2019ll know when you taste it later. The food here is really the best I\u2019ve ever eaten.\u201d After entering the restaurant, the square-faced man lightly patted the woman\u2019s back with a smile.\u201cAlright, the food make you spend so much money, it must be delicious.\u201d Wu Liying laughed indifferently.Her demeanor was polite, her tone gentle, and she had the bearing of a lady from a noble family. She must have been a beauty when she was young.\u201cAlthough it is a bit expensive, you have seen the notice board at the entrance. It has already sold seven cards. If you don\u2019t buy it now, you won\u2019t be able to afford it later.\u201d The square-faced man shook his head slightly.\u201cIf you want to buy it, then buy it. We\u2019re all old, and our children are good too. If they know you like it, then don\u2019t mention the money, they would buy it for you even it is ten million.\u201d Wu Liying chuckled.\u201cThat won\u2019t do.\u201d His square face straightened as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy for them to earn money. Moreover, even though they are my children, I do not like to accept so much money from them.\u201dThe square-faced man\u2019s name was Li Qiang. He used to work for the government and was a division chief. Although he had retired, he still had some authority.He had a son and a daughter, both of whom were top students and had developed business brains. His son had started a financial company, his daughter a cosmetics company, his eldest son has a son, and his youngest daughter has a daughter; What a happy family.He and Wu Liying only needed to enjoy their elder lives for now. In these few years, their children would give them money every month, and they knew that Wang Qiang did not like receiving money, so they would only give Wu Liying money every time.On the other hand, last night, Wang Qiang had sat on the sofa and thought about it for a long time, but in the end, he couldn\u2019t hold it in. He said that he wanted to buy a membership card, causing Wu Liying to feel that it was really funny and historic.Thus, the next scene appeared.After the two of them entered the door, they spoke a little and stood in front of the service counter. Wang Qiang\u2019s gaze turned to Zhang Han and he waved his hand: \u201cLittle Boss, we want to buy a membership card.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dZhang Han stood up and nodded his head as he walked over.Zhang Han had some impression of Wang Qiang, it was the first time he had visited him the night before yesterday, and he had come to eat every meal during these two days as well.\u201cHere, transfer the money.\u201d Zhang Han handed over his bank card.\u201cYes, three million. Three membership cards.\u201d Wang Qiang operate the phone for a while before showing it to Zhang Han.\u201cEh? Why three? There only two of us? \u201d Wu Liying asked hesitantly.\u201cHow can two be enough?\u201d Wang Qiang curled his lips and said: \u201cWe still have a grandchild and granddaughter; we\u2019ll bring them over to eat later. The membership cards here can only be used by one person, we can\u2019t make them queue up, and if not, they won\u2019t be able to eat food.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Wu Liying smiled and said: \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then if we were to eat, wouldn\u2019t our sons and daughters also have to come?\u201d\u201cThey?\u201d Wang Qiang lightly snorted, and said: \u201cThey nearly return home, don\u2019t care about them, if they want to come eat, then line up for themselves, hmph.\u201dAfter Wu Liying heard this, she shook her head with a smile.Seeing that, Zhang Han chuckled, took out number 8, number 9 and number 10 card and said: \u201cThree membership cards.\u201d\u201cLiying, take them.\u201d Wang Qiang passed the membership card to Wu Liying and looked at Zhang Han: \u201cLittle Boss, can you give us two cups of milk to drink first?\u201d\u201cAlright, the milk will be ready in ten minutes.\u201d Zhang Han nodded, he stood up and walked towards the kitchen.Wang Qiang and Wu Liying walked towards the member\u2019s table.\u201cLiying, let\u2019s sit at the table inside. The seats on the outside are the seats that the four youngsters use every day.\u201dWang Qiang led Wu Liying and sat at the innermost table.After bringing some milk to Wang Qiang and his wife, he poured himself another cup. While drinking, he chatted with Zhang Han for a while, and decided that he would go to Mount New Moon tomorrow morning to deliver the fish seedlings.The dinner was still just Egg-Fried Rice. This time, Zhang Han only brought Mengmeng a little rice.\u201cUn humph, PaPa, this\u2026 Ugh \u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s too little, not enough to eat \u2026\u201d Mengmeng pouted her mouth and said unhappily.Zhang Han said many things to amuse her, and after telling Mengmeng that she could eat delicious food at night, Mengmeng reluctantly agreed.There were still many people lining up in front of the restaurant.However, the thirty small chairs were not filled. There were about twenty people there, because everyone seemed to know that there was basically no food left in the back row.Ye Zichen could only leave with a sad face, while mumbling to himself, \u201cIf I had a membership card \u2026\u201dIn their hearts, with this restaurant\u2019s membership card, the status was high. When every member walked towards the member\u2019s table, they would always attract people\u2019s attention. The envy in their eyes could be seen by anyone.Unknowingly, in the hearts of these customers, the membership card of Zhang Han\u2019s restaurant had exceeded everything else.Brand of clothes? Can you eat it?Rolex? Can you eat it?Lamborghini, Ferrari? Can you eat it?Oh, Michelin\u2019s Three Star Restaurant? I can eat, but I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not going. I only want Egg Fried Rice! I only recognize \u2018Mengmeng\u2019s Leisure Dining Room\u2019.Gradually, the customers all felt the same way.Eating was of course important, in their eyes, Zhang Han\u2019s restaurant had already become the most important place in their hearts.However, when Zhang Han saw this scene, he would always ponder for a moment.The restaurant\u2019s space was smaller and more crowded, making Zhang Han a little unhappy about it. The ten members were all filled, if there were more members, then there wouldn\u2019t even be a seat.Could it be that he had to give up some seats for the members? Should he give the member prices a tenfold increase? Or simply not selling members?Zhang Han thought about the question, but the words are already said, and since he already wrote them all, then that\u2019s it. The other membership cards will be sold ten million each, which will decrease the number of people who want to buy it.If the customers knew what he was thinking, they would definitely bow down to him.The boss is way too unrational, isn\u2019t it?The membership was so expensive, so why would he despise it?However, they did not know just how high Zhang Han\u2019s perspective was.After dinner, it was already past 7:00 pm.Zhao Feng was the last to leave. Before he left, he naturally cleaned up the dining hall once more.Little did he know that his actions were already saw by some people.As Zhao Feng was driving away, there was a black Buick on the other side of the street.A grim-looking driver took out his mobile phone and made a call.\u201cLord Tang, Zhao Feng has been staying in the same restaurant every day, called Mengmeng\u2019s Leisure Restaurant. He is very familiar with the owner and has helped him do some work.The driver informed everyone about the news. In a mansion on the side of the New Moon Bay Road, a man in his forties stood in front of the window. He wore a bathrobe, and looked at the three gorgeous women playing in the pool outside.Tang Zhan\u2019s appearance was very calm, just like a neighbor\u2019s uncle. His thick eyebrows and big eyes, lips were a bit thick, and his facial features were sharp and straight.After he finished listening to this piece of news, the corner of his mouth curled up into a faint smile.\u201cOh? \u201cIs that so?\u201dAfter he lightly murmured to himself, he directly hung up the phone and looked at the direction of the New Moon Bay below the mountain with a profound gaze.\u2026\u2026\u201cBrother, Mengmeng princess is here!\u201dZhang Li ran into the dining hall while smiling. She was holding two bags, one containing some snacks, and the other a few toys.\u201cHmm, thank you, aunt. Aunt is so kind.\u201d Mengmeng was very happy when someone gave her a gift. She blinked her large and clear eyes as she thanked Zhang Li.\u201cHee hee, of course Aunt likes Mengmeng. Didn\u2019t you see that I only brought a present for Mengmeng?\u201d Zhang Li laughed as he rubbed Mengmeng\u2019s little head.\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d Seeing Zhang Li running over from the other side, Zhang Han asked.\u201cI took the subway.\u201d Zhang Li replied.\u201cSubway? You don\u2019t have a car here? \u201d Zhang Han was startled, and felt that he was a little careless.\u201cWhy do I need a car? I don\u2019t have any interest in cars right now. \u201d Zhang Li smiled slightly.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - Zhang Li was shockedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euWhen Zhang Li went out, she only had six hundred thousand with her. After the trip, she was out of money and she finally came to XiangJiang to work.She didn\u2019t have enough money, let alone buy a car.Seeing that, Zhang Han did not say anything, and directly took out his mobile phone, took out the technology master\u2019s name card, and called.\u201cHello, may I ask who this is?\u201d When the call connected, the technician asked in a deep voice.\u201cI am the one who bought the modified Panda car two days ago.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cOh, boss, it\u2019s you, eh \u2026\u201d Is there a problem with the car? \u201d The technician\u2019s warm words carried a hint of nervousness.\u201cNo, I want to buy another car.\u201d Zhang Han said plainly.\u201cBuy another one?\u201d The technician sounded pleasantly surprised and asked, \u201cWhat kind of car do you want to buy?\u201d\u201cMaserati GT, the white one. When do you have time to come over and take care of the formalities? Just drive the car over here tomorrow.\u201d Zhang Han said.The Maserati GT was Zhang Li\u2019s favorite car. Zhang Han obviously remembered this, so he didn\u2019t ask Zhang Li what kind of car she wanted and directly booked it.\u201cOkay, okay, boss. I\u2019ll be there in twenty minutes.\u201d The technician was thrilled when he heard this, and even his voice could not help but tremble.Zhang Han spending one million and eight hundred thousand to change the car had already shocked the technician. Only a few days had passed, and this boss had once again casually bought a two million yuan sports car.Too happy!\u201cYes.\u201dZhang Han replied and hung up. He had always been rather casual, no matter what he wanted to buy or what he wanted to do, he would do it. He would buy whatever he wanted to buy, whatever he wanted to do.Currently, with Zhang Han\u2019s knowledge, he no longer cared about any laws or regulations. What a joke, with Zhang Han\u2019s strength at the peak of the tribulation Realm back then, a single palm from him could destroy an entire planet.Rules? It\u2019s just for breaking.For example, right now, Zhang Han wanted to buy a car for his sister and get them to make the deal in his place. Furthermore, they had to deliver the car over here tomorrow, if he couldn\u2019t do it, That was because the money was not enough!There was nothing money couldn\u2019t do in this world. If it really didn\u2019t work, then he would give him a bowl of Egg-Fried Rice. If it didn\u2019t work, then he would have a cup of milk. If it still didn\u2019t work, then Zhang Han will have to use violence.However, there was a requirement to be casual about everything. With a low competence, one had to think about everything else slightly, just like how Zhang Han wanted to sell his house and to buy a mountain. As his competence gradually increased, he could of course do whatever he wanted.Zhang Li obviously did not know this much. At this time, she was a little confused, and she subconsciously asked:\u201cBro, why are you buying me a car? I thought you don\u2019t have that much money? \u201dZhang Li obviously knew about the matter of Zhang Han renting a mountain, renting restaurants and selling houses. She even knew that the money from selling houses had been spent. So Zhang Li was puzzled.\u201cFollow me.\u201dZhang Han chuckled, he took out a pen from the drawer behind the desk and brought Zhang Li to the door.\u201cBusiness hours\u2026 Three hours a day? Three hundred yuan per serving of Egg-Fried Rice? A hundred dollars a cup of milk? Two hundred per dish? Four hundred meat dishes? Membership card, top ten were one million? Number eleventh to twentieth were ten million? Oh my god, brother, are you crazy? How can you do business like this? Aren\u2019t you just waiting for bankrupt \u201d Zhang Li opened her eyes widely, and said with an expression of disbelief.However, Zhang Han only smiled slightly, he then wrote a few words on the back of the membership card.\u201cThe first ten membership cards have been sold, 10/20.\u201dAfter writing it, Zhang Han looked at the dazed Zhang Li with a smile on his face.At this moment, there was no need to say anything; everything was contained in these words.\u201cBrother?\u201d Is this for real? \u201d\u201cThe first ten membership cards have been sold out?\u201d\u201cHow many days have you been running a restaurant?\u201d\u201cAre you trying to trick them?\u201d\u201cImpossible, you are a kitchen killer! \u201cHow could it be sold for such a high price?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThese information, was something that even Zhang Li would not believe. She glared at Zhang Han and questioned him several times.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, my sister? Aren\u2019t you underestimating your brother too much?\u201dZhang Han didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, he took out his cellphone from his pocket, opened his message board and tapped the message from the bank.When Zhang Li saw that there were more than eight million in deposits, she was completely stunned. She looked at Zhang Han in a daze, not knowing what to say.Little sister, money is just a bunch of numbers. After some time, big brother will let you know what real life is, and we will have to properly enjoy it in the future. Just quit the DJ job of yours. Zhang Han patted Zhang Li\u2019s shoulder.\u201cI like DJ. I wave my hands on the stage, and many people below the stage are screaming and dancing to the rhythm. That\u2019s the feeling I like.\u201d Zhang Li stuck out her tongue, and said those words with a smile, but after that her expression became serious, and said: \u201cBrother, you are truly amazing. You have only been in XiangJiang for a few days, and you already have such achievements.\u201d\u201cHahahaha, is this still my little witch sister? Previously, didn\u2019t 10 million in your eyes was count as pocket money? Little sister, you will know in the future that this world is just a place for our entertainment. \u201d Zhang Han smiled lightly.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Zhang Li could not help but laugh out loud. She rolled her eyes at Zhang Han and said: \u201cLook at what you\u2019re saying, haha, you\u2019re actually talking like the arrogant Young Master Zhang from before.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about that.\u201d Zhang Han shook his head slightly.Looking at it now, what Shang Jing\u2019s Fourth Young Master, that feeling was like a primary school student fighting for the position of class monitor.But in reality, the Fourth Young Master of Shang Jing was an honor admired by tens of thousands.Zhang Han and Zhang Li returned to the house and played with Mengmeng. Zhang Li normally did not like children, so she thought that it was too annoying. However, when it came to Mengmeng, she sincerely liked her.Without a doubt, she was definitely a great beauty. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to give birth to such a beautiful Mengmeng.After about ten minutes, the technician came back. There were also three people who came with, the Xiao Yun who sold the car to Zhang Han, the person in charge of the trade and the technician.As an old employee, the technical master knew a lot of things, and this time, he was the one who brought two other people over. He had decided that he would give away a little bit of money and maintain a better relationship with them, and in the future, they would take care of him no matter what business they had. After all, he was a supportive technical expert, and anyway Zhang Han was still brought over by Xiao Yun.As an old seller, he also knew that money wasn\u2019t earned by one person. Winning together was a good direction.The three of them signed a contract with Zhang Li. Zhang Han paid them, and spent two million six hundred buying Maserati GT, landing tax and other fees were three million and four hundred thousand totally. Zhang Han directly paid them three million and five hundred thousand, telling them to drive the car here the next day.The technician was so happy that his mouth could not even close as he nodded in agreement.After he finished doing all this, it was already nine o\u2019clock in the morning. Zhang Han began working in the kitchen.chopped the two chickens into pieces, and Zhang Han threw the chicken butt away.Although Mount New Moon\u2019s chicken bones were harder, Zhang Han\u2019s knife was even sharper. With a wave of his blade, it flashed, and the size of the chicken meat was almost the same.The thighs, calves, and the tips of the wings were all partially cut open by Zhang Han.After preparing the chicken meat, Zhang Han cleaned up the potatoes, eggplant, and beans.It had only been ten minutes, and all the ingredients had already finished. If it was anyone else, he might not even be able to chop this chicken in ten minutes.Zhang Han\u2019s actions in the kitchen were flexible like flowing water, but this scene was not seen by the two who were playing on the sofa.\u201cMengmeng, let\u2019s go get your mother.\u201d Zhang Han hung his apron over his shoulder, and said after washing his hands.\u201cEn ha, alright. Go get Mama, get Mama \u2026\u201d The little princess waved her hands happily.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Zhang Han carried Mengmeng in his arms.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Zhang Li asked.\u201cTo the airport. You can stay here and watch TV for a while.\u201d Zhang Han said.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of watching TV? I\u2019ll go too, we\u2019ll go together. \u201d Zhang Li stood up and said.Staying here and watching TV, Zhang Li felt bored to death. It was boring to be alone, so he might as well go to the airport with Zhang Han to pick her up.So Zhang Han locked the door, and when Zhang Li arrived in front of the car, she was immediately stunned.\u201cBrother, it\u2019s not like you have no money, why are you driving this car?\u201d Zhang Li asked suspiciously.She remembered that Zhang Han loved super sports car the most. Back in Shang Jing, there were around 10 supercar s in his garage. Every week, Zhang Han would go there to race and seek excitement.But now, a Geely Panda was in front of her, causing Zhang Li to be stunned.\u201cOh, because, because this one looks good, the others don\u2019t look good.\u201d Mengmeng explained first.From Mengmeng\u2019s perspective, this car looked like a giant panda, and the car wasn\u2019t that big. It looked like a big toy, no matter how much it cost, it would just look good.\u201cI don\u2019t have any goals for these things, I\u2019ll buy whatever Mengmeng likes.\u201d Zhang Han chuckled, and handed Mengmeng over to Zhang Li, then walked to his original position and said: \u201cGet on.\u201dZhang Li smiled as she looked at Zhang Han, and said: \u201cYou treat Mengmeng really well.\u201d\u201cHmm hah, my PaPa is super good.\u201d Mengmeng said with a serious expression.Liked it?

    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - Li Cheng who had been beaten to a pulpPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euLi Cheng crushed the cigarette in his hand and threw it on the ground. Then, he walked toward inside,and he parked his car there.On the other hand, when Zi Yan and Zhou Fei saw how Zhang Han acted and how Li Cheng was beaten up, Zhou Fei pursed her lips into a smile. Although Zi Yan did not have much expression, the slight raise of her red lips showed that she was laughing in her heart.However, when Zi Yan and Yue Shan saw the cute panda car, they were slightly stunned.\u201cGet in.\u201d Zhang Han said as he walked to the driver\u2019s seat.\u201cI\u2019m dizzy. Why did you make a car like this?\u201d Zhou Fei said with a grin.\u201cHo ho.\u201dAt this time, Li Cheng, who was not far away, let out a sneer. He unlocked the car key in his hand and lit up the car lights of the BMW i8 beside the Geely Panda.The price of the car was two million, it was casually driven one by Li Cheng, he saw that the person Zi Yan went to meet with drove a car that was worth tens of thousands of RMB, he felt disdain in his heart, and even his tone had a hint of disdain:\u201cZi Yan, how about you take my car and leave, I can send you to the place first, with your identity, if people find out that you are riding in a car like that, it would lower your price anyhow.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t trouble Young Master Li then.\u201dZi Yan shook her head slightly. There was her precious daughter waiting for her inside, how could she possibly sit in someone else\u2019s car?After saying that, Zi Yan and Zhou Fei opened the car door and got in, through the window, one could faintly see that at the back seat, there was a woman carrying Mengmeng, so Zi Yan got in the back seat while Zhou Fei sat in the front seat.Before Zhang Han got on the carriage, he glanced at Li Cheng indifferently.In his eyes, there was indifference. Adding the disregard from before, this gaze made Li Cheng feel that Zhang Han was looking down on him!Li Cheng\u2019s heart suddenly became irritable.He got into his sportscar with an ugly expression and slammed the steering wheel.Why are you doing this?Ignore me, look down on me, on what basis are you? Based on the panda car that no one would want if you threw it on the street?Li Cheng gasped for breath. He was not angry only because of Zhang Han\u2019s disregard, but also because of Zi Yan\u2019s attitude towards him as well as her choices.\u2018You\u2019d rather ride in a broken panda than ride in my car, wouldn\u2019t you? \u2018Li Cheng\u2019s gaze gradually turned cold.\u201cWhat a bitch!\u201d Li Cheng coldly snorted, \u201cI will let you clearly see what reality is! When I take you down, I want to see just how you can continue acting cool with me!\u201dWith that said, Li Cheng started up the car and rushed out from the side of the Geely Panda, leaving behind the sound of engine.At the same time, in Zhang Han\u2019s car.\u201cMama, ma, I missed you so much \u2026\u201d Mengmeng happily stretched out her arm. When Zi Yan carried her in his embrace, Mengmeng also did not care about the matter regarding the foundation powder that the PaPa had told her about, and directly gave a kiss on Zi Yan\u2019s face.\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too, Mengmeng, the past few days I\u2019ve been away, is there anything good about you?\u201d Zi Yan smiled, extremely happy.Her beautiful face was truly so beautiful that it could bring down a country with a smile.\u201cHmm hah, Mengmeng, Mengmeng is so obedient. SHe\u2019s with the PaPa everyday, hmm\u2026 We draw even drew the PaPa, Mama and Mengmeng, they look really good. \u201d Mengmeng said seriously as she blinked her large clear eyes.As everyone knew, the eyes of a child were extremely beautiful, as if they were naturally born with beautiful pupils. The pupils were large, and were extremely bright, let alone a delicate girl like Mengmeng.\u201cIs that so? Is Mengmeng that powerful?\u201d Zi Yan smiled and pinched Mengmeng\u2019s cheeks.\u201cAh, wait, wait until we return to my casual restaurant. Hm, I\u2019ll take it out for Mama to look at Mengmeng\u2019s painting.\u201d Mengmeng said with her sweet voice.When he said that, Zhang Han who was driving couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He was afraid that when Zi Yan saw the painting, her expression would be very interesting.\u201cAlright, then let\u2019s wait and see. Other than painting, what else did Mengmeng do?\u201d Zi Yan asked with a smile.\u201cMm \u2026 Also, there\u2019s that piano, the PaPa had taught Mengmeng how to play, and Mengmeng was able to play simple song \u2026 \u201dMengmeng pouted her small mouth and said seriously.It had been a few days since she had last time seen Mama, and now was the time for Mama to \u2018claim credit\u2019.\u201cIs that so?\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s face was filled with suspicion, she looked at Zhang Han and asked: \u201cDoes your PaPa know how to play the piano?\u201d\u201cHe knows how to, and he\u2019s amazing. PaPa is so nice, hmm \u2026 They all said that PaPa was a Master, they all really admired Mengmeng, and they all envied me for having such a good PaPa. \u201d Mengmeng said with a slightly proud expression.Looking at her bright eyes, she was sure that she, PaPa, was feeling great.After seeing Zhang Li, Zi Yan was a little dazed. After playing with Mengmeng for a while, when they reached the New Moon Bay, Mengmeng snuggled against hers chest and started humming a song.\u201cYou must be Zi Yan? Hello, I am Zhang Han\u2019s little sister, my name is Zhang Li. \u201dZhang Li extended her hand in a very courteous manner.When she first saw that Mengmeng\u2019s mother was Zi Yan, Zhang Li was truly a little surprised in her heart.Back then, Zi Yan was a pure jade girl, but there were very few rumors. How did she end up with her brother in this situation? And how did he give birth to a child without a sound?It turned out that Zi Yan had retired from the Entertainment Circle five years ago because she was giving birth to a child.\u2018Damn, my brother will use it when he doesn\u2019t make a move. One move can shake the world! \u2018Zhang Li was shocked in her heart, but she recovered herself a few minutes later. Back then, when she and Zhang Han was at the Zhang Family\u2019s most glorious time, they had walked unhindered in the Shang Jing, and Zhang Li was also a genuine great witch.But after leaving the Zhang Family, Zhang Li\u2019s untamed nature had been tempered, but she naturally had her own personality and pride, so when she saw that Mengmeng\u2019s mother was Zi Yan, she was only slightly shocked.\u201cHello.\u201d Zi Yan and Zhang Li shook hands, and looked at each other.To be honest, when she first got on the car, Zi Yan had a moment of wild imagination.\u2018A woman? \u2018\u2018Who is she? \u2018\u2018What\u2019s the relationship with Zhang Han? \u2018\u2018Could it be Zhang Han\u2019s girlfriend? \u2018\u201cWhy is Mengmeng so close to her? \u2018Could it be that she has already accepted her identity? \u2018\u2018How can it be? This won\u2019t do!\u201dIn that moment, Zi Yan\u2019s heart was in a mess, but following that, Mengmeng the sweet little heart came over and pulled Zi Yan\u2019s thoughts back.Now that she heard Zhang Li\u2019s introduction, Zi Yan\u2019s heart inexplicably relaxed.\u201cZi Yan, you just became like a few years ago, oh no, you have become even more beautiful.\u201d Zhang Li looked at Zi Yan\u2019s exquisite cheek, and sincerely praised.\u201cThank you. You\u2019re beautiful too.\u201d Zi Yan smiled slightly.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I have become beautiful, it\u2019s because Elder Sister Yan was too immature in the past. Now that I have \u2026\u201d Zhou Fei said casually.Before she even finished speaking, Zi Yan glared and said:\u201cFei Fei?\u201d\u201cEh \u2026\u201d Zhou Fei grinned, holding back the words she wanted to say.Originally, she wanted to say: \u201cAfter being nourished by your brother, having given birth to Mengmeng and becoming a spicy mother, her charm is even more beautiful now. It\u2019s full of flavour.\u201dHowever, Zi Yan, who knew Zhou Fei very well, interrupted her immediately.However, what Zhou Fei said was also the truth. The word, charm, was not something that a young girl could possess.\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d Zhang Li muttered to herself, wanting to call Zi Yan her sister-in-law, but Zhang Han had told her to pay attention to this point, and she felt that it wouldn\u2019t be the same if she called him Elder Sister Yan.\u201cYes.\u201d Zi Yan nodded.\u201cI really admire you. You can even retire from the title of \u2018Movie Queen\u2019 soon.\u201d Zhang Li praised.After Zi Yan heard this, her eyes flashed. With a somewhat determined tone, she said, \u201cMovie Queen, you can bring it back now.\u201d\u201cHmm? Are you coming back? \u201d Zhang Li asked in shock.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve just prepared an album for release on the 15th. The news will probably be released the day after tomorrow.\u201d Zi Yan said as she nodded her head.\u201cWow, if you were to return, the fans back then would probably be very surprised.\u201d Zhang Li laughed.\u201cHopefully.\u201d Zi Yan smiled slightly.There was also some anticipation in her eyes. After the star had turned cold, it would be extremely difficult for her to return, and Zi Yan was one of those people who had completely retired, as if she had been banned.The development of Entertainment Circle was very fast. In five years, new king came out one after another, and the changes of the era made this road even harder to walk on. However, Zi Yan still had a lot of confidence in herself.While they were talking, everyone arrived at Zhang Han\u2019s restaurant.\u201cAiyo, not bad. That guy has quite the taste.\u201dEntering the hall, Zi Yan and Zhou Fei took a few glances at the surroundings. This kind of dining hall with a family layout made them feel very good.Then, her gaze landed on the Steinway Piano at the side. She walked over in bewilderment. After opening the lid and taking a few glances, she was thoroughly shocked.\u201cOh my god, Zhang Han, do you really know how to play the piano? I even got myself a Steinway. That\u2019s not a decoration, is it? \u201dHowever, Zhang Han ignored her as usual.They were a little surprised to see the layout of the dining room and the Steinway piano, but it would have been even more so if they had seen the notice board in front of the door during the day.But Zi Yan did not care about all this, and sat on the big sofa in front of the TV with Mengmeng in her arms, her beautiful hands reaching into her big bag.\u201cMengmeng, close your eyes first.\u201d Zi Yan said with a smile.\u201cEh?\u201d Mengmeng was startled, then she quickly closed her eyes.\u201cBe good and don\u2019t open your eyes secretly.\u201d As Zi Yan said this, she took out a rectangular gift box that was about 20 cm in length and width from her bag. A flower shape was tied to the gift box with a ribbon.Zi Yan placed the box on the tea table in front of him. Seeing that Mengmeng had obediently closed his eyes, Zi Yan laughed and said: \u201cAlright, you can open your eyes now.\u201dMengmeng was very obedient, when she opened her big eyes, the first thing she saw was the box in front of her.\u201cWow, a gift, a gift, a gift, a gift, a gift, a gift, a gift.\u201dLiked it?

At this moment, the little princess was smiling so happily that her cherry lips couldn\u2019t even close.\u201cOpen it and take a look?\u201d Zi Yan said with a smile.Seeing Mengmeng being so happy, Zi Yan\u2019s heart was also greatly satisfied.\u201cMama, open it for me \u2026\u201d Mengmeng chuckled.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s drive together. See this ribbon? Each of us will get one. You grab this, I\u2019ll grab that! Come, one, two, three, open! \u201dZi Yan and Mengmeng each held onto a side of a buckle, and with a light tug on the outside, the colored ribbons were untied.This time, Mengmeng did not wait for Mama to speak and directly opened the box with her small hand.\u201cEh?\u201dMengmeng looked at the black box that looked like a 10 inch laptop and was a little confused. She blinked her large eyes and asked Zi Yan in her voice, \u201cMama, what is this?\u201d\u201cMama, open it for you.\u201dZi Yan laughed and took out the colourful brush case. After opening it, Mengmeng saw so many colourful brushes, and her eyes lit up.\u201cWow, so many colored pens. So pretty.\u201d\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Zi Yan laughed.\u201cI like it, I like it. Mom is so good, huh.\u201d Mengmeng pouted her cute golden fish mouth and ran towards Zi Yan\u2019s face, preparing to give her a kiss.\u201cCough cough, Mengmeng.\u201d Zhang Han, who was standing at the back of the sofa, opened his mouth and reminded: \u201cPastel.\u201dThey had already kissed several times, and seeing that Mengmeng still wanted to kiss her again, Zhang Han felt that it was time to remind her.\u201cOh \u2026\u201d Mengmeng stopped in her tracks. She looked at the PaPa, then at Mama, wanting to kiss but not being able to. She didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to care? I didn\u2019t wipe the foundation, it\u2019s fine, Mengmeng kisses me. \u201d Zi Yan rolled her eyes at Zhang Han as she moved her left cheek closer to her.\u201cWhat?\u201d Mengmeng kissed it a few times.\u201cCome, give Aunty Feifei a kiss.\u201d Zhou Fei looked at her surroundings, then sat on the right side of Mengmeng and passed her own face belt over.\u201cEn hmph, no, PaPa won\u2019t allow Mengmeng to kiss others.\u201d Mengmeng reached out her small palm, and gently pushed Zhou Fei\u2019s face as she refused.\u201cHumph! Then Aunty Feifei doesn\u2019t like you. \u201d Zhou Fei snorted.\u201cThen I don\u2019t like you either.\u201d Mengmeng leaned her body into Zi Yan\u2019s embrace and pouted: \u201cI\u2019m not going to play with smelly Aunty Feifei. Mama, let\u2019s draw.I will show you pictures I drawed.\u201dMengmeng suddenly remembered that the pictures she drew with PaPa a few days ago had not been shown to Mama, so she slipped out from Zi Yan\u2019s bosom and landed on the ground barefooted. Her two small hands opened the drawer of the table, and from inside, she took out the drawing.\u201cUgh \u2026\u201d Mengmeng pointed to the pig-headed being amongst them and said: \u201cThis is PaPa \u2026\u201d\u201cPuchi\u2026\u201d Zi Yan could not help but laugh.\u201cThis, this is Mama.\u201d Mengmeng then pointed to another person. Her face that was even longer than a donkey\u2019s and eyes the size of sesame seeds caused Zi Yan\u2019s expression to turn stiff on the spot.\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201d Zhou Fei held her stomach and laughed, then said: \u201cIt\u2019s too beautiful, so beautiful, so similar.My God, I\u2019m dying from laughter.\u201d\u201cWhat are you laughing at, shut up.\u201d Zi Yan rolled her eyes at Zhou Fei.\u201cEh?\u201dMengmeng was startled, she did not know what was going on, thus she asked: \u201cMama, is Mengmeng\u2019s drawing good?\u201d\u201cHaha \u2026\u201d Seeing the twitching corner of Zi Yan\u2019s mouth, Zhou Fei laughed once again.Even Zhang Han chuckled from behind as he shook his head.\u201cVery beautiful, Mengmeng is really amazing.\u201d Zi Yan laughed as she rubbed Mengmeng\u2019s little head.The child needs to be encouraged and praised at such times, so that she can keep groping for it.\u201cReally?\u201d Mengmeng was very happy and asked again.\u201cOf course it\u2019s true.\u201d Zi Yan smiled and said: \u201cIs the most beautiful and most cute Mengmeng?\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah. Is Mengmeng good-looking?\u201d\u201cOh, the most beautiful one is Mengmeng.\u201d\u201cHehe, Mengmeng was painted by PaPa, Mama and PaPa are the prettiest and prettiest to look at \u2026\u201d\u201cThen draw a Mengmeng.\u201d\u201cUh-huh. Me and Mama and I will draw together.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dZi Yan and Mengmeng hadn\u2019t seen each other for a few days, and were so bored that they started playing enthusiastically on the sofa. On the other hand, Zhou Fei would occasionally interrupt and interact on the side, and occasionally glance at her own phone.Zhang Han watched them for a few minutes, then he turned around and went into the kitchen to prepare dinner.Zhang Li stood by the counter and watched Zhang Han busy himself.After cooking the rice, the first dish he cooked was a chicken stew with potatoes.The main ingredient is chicken and potatoes, plus onion, ginger, garlic and other condiments, taste is mellow, the process is stewed, the meat of the chicken is tender, delicious, suitable for multiple cooking methods, and rich in nutrition, with the role of nourishing the body.But in recent years, more and more chemical feed is being used to feed chickens, which makes the nutrition lost too much, and there are even many harmful substances to the body.Therefore, this kind of chicken would only cost around twenty yuan each. Thus, the price of a chicken would only be a hundred yuan.It wasn\u2019t just a matter of nutrition. The meat itself was much less fragrant, so no matter what the feed and meat chicken did, it wouldn\u2019t be able to produce the pure fragrance of a local chicken.Not to mention the chickens raised in Mount New Moon.Zhang Han boiled the chicken with water. This was the step to remove the impurities, but Zhang Han did not understand it. He only remembered that it was like this when he watched his mother cook in the past.After boiling it for a few minutes, the meat on the outside of the chicken was slightly cooked. At this moment, Zhang Han could smell the fragrance of the meat.After that, he poured oil into the wok, put the chicken pieces into the wok, stir-fry a few times, add spring onion, garlic, soy sauce, stir-fry and then add water, add a little old color blending, add cooking wine, pepper ingredients, salt and fragrant wood, cover the wok, cook it for ten minutes, change the heat, and when the chicken was about to ripen, add potatoes. This was the final process.At this time, Zhang Han began to cook the second stew, the soy horned fried eggplant.This was a common dish, and Zhang Han was familiar with the route. He worked orderly and good at cooking, and after entering the wok, Zhang Han began to make cucumbers and peel.Cucumber was a cucumber from Mount New Moon. When it was flattened, a fresh fragrance wafted into his nose.Cut the cucumber into small pieces, pull the skin and put it on a plate. Sprinkle with a little salt, sugar and MSG.After preparing all these, Zhang Han made some cucumber peel sauce, vinegar, cold sauce and a little sesame oil.Ten minutes later, he poured the juice into the cucumber skin and the cold dish was done.\u201cMy god.\u201dZhang Li had been watching by the side the entire time. Seeing this, she was truly shocked in her heart as she said with wide eyes: \u201cThis dish looks pretty good. Bro, you really know how to cook?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate your brother.\u201d Zhang Han laughed indifferently.As he spoke, he picked up the chicken pot with one hand and filled it to the brim with chicken stewed potatoes with a porcelain pot that looked like a small pot for soup. He placed it at the edge of the counter.Without the inhalation of the oil hood, a hot fragrance began to waft through the room.\u201cWow, it smells that good?\u201d Zhang Li immediately looked over.He saw that the plate of chicken porridge with potatoes was glistening with oil. It was a light red and emitted a pure fragrance, causing Zhang Li to instantly gulp down two mouthfuls of saliva.\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there. Serve the dishes, put them on the round table.\u201d Seeing Zhang Li\u2019s appearance, Zhang Han laughed lightly, and then turned and washed the wok clean. He poured oil into it and prepared to fry the last egg, Stir-Fried Green Chili Pepper.After Zhang Li heard this, he picked up the big plate and walked over to the round dining table. During this time, his eyes never left the dining table, why did the pieces of chicken look so dazzling?What was going on?Zhang Li was a little stupefied. She did not understand how the taste could be so fragrant, and when she looked at the piece of chicken leg meat in front of her, she felt an extreme urge to pick it up and eat a few bites.However, Zi Yan and Zhou Fei were still sitting on the sofa, so she would definitely not do such an impolite action.\u2018Well, if only they weren\u2019t again.\u2019Zhang Li\u2019s saliva flowed profusely, and she once again swallowed a mouthful of saliva as she lightly muttered in her heart.If they two weren\u2019t here. Zhang Li would not hesitate now and directly grab the chicken leg in his hands, opening her mouth wide and biting onto it in large bites. Right, she wanted to take a big bite and eat the extremely fragrant chicken in large gulps!However, this was only her imagination. There were no ifs in the world, and the gazes of the three people on the sofa had already landed on Zhang Li\u2019s body. Oh no, it was the dish Zhang Li was holding in her hand.\u201cDamn it? Are you for real? \u201d Zhou Fei did not care about her image at all, she took a few breaths and smelled the fragrance, and then said in a surprised tone: \u201cIs it so fragrant? Damn, the impoverished young master actually knew how to cook? Zhang Han, are you serious? You didn\u2019t put poison in the dish, did you? How could it be so fragrant? That\u2019s impossible!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s impossible?\u201d Zhang Li snorted and said: \u201cIf you think that you have already ingested the poison, then don\u2019t eat it. We can all eat this.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t do, my good sister \u2026 That\u2026 It wasn\u2019t easy to cook dinner for Mengmeng\u2019s father, so I have to properly try it out. \u201d Zhou Fei curled her lips and replied.The two of them had similar personalities, it was just that Zhang Li was a little \u2018stronger\u2019 than her. If it wasn\u2019t for her not knowing the situation and Zhang Li ridiculing her brother, she would have attacked them long ago.At this moment, even Mengmeng had left Zi Yan\u2019s embrace. She stood on the sofa and shouted while jumping:\u201cPaPa, PaPa, it smells so good, Mengmeng is so hungry, Mengmeng wants to eat it.\u201d\u201cMengmeng, don\u2019t be anxious. It\u2019s almost done.\u201d Zhang Han did not turn back as he chuckled and continued with his last dish.Fried green peppers with eggs was also a common dish. As a side dish, Zhang Han only used four eggs and two green peppers.After they left the wok, Zhang Han waved his hands at Zhang Li and laughed: \u201cServe the dishes!\u201dWith a tone that seemed to call for a waiter, Zhang Li snorted and walked over to bring the dishes over.Liked it?

    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 Locked eyesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMe too.\u201d Zhou Fei stood up and went over to help out while taking the five bowls of rice and placing them neatly on the table.\u201cShall we eat on the first floor? What if \u2026 What do we do if someone suddenly enters? \u201dZi Yan asked as she looked at Zhang Han with some hesitation.\u201cNo one will come.\u201d Zhang Han shook his head slightly.\u201cOh, Mama, Mama, hurry up and carry me over. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d Mengmeng anxiously said from the sofa. After Zi Yan carried her up, she continued: \u201cMama, about that \u2026 They come at that time every day and they don\u2019t come at the other time. \u201d\u201cWhat time was that?\u201d Zi Yan said while laughing.\u201cIt\u2019s that time \u2026\u201d Mengmeng explained with a serious face.Seeing that, Zhang Han laughed and shook his head: \u201cEvery day, in the morning and night, everyone will be open for an hour, the rules are all on the notice board at the door, you guys didn\u2019t see it when you first came in.\u201d\u201cOnly open for three hours a day?\u201dZi Yan was startled, but soon recovered.Who is Zhang Han? Back then, as one of the Fourth Young Master of Shang Jing, leaving Shang Jing was already a big change. Could it be that he was really able to open a restaurant?Zi Yan guessed that this dining hall was a place that was specially made for Mengmeng to cook. He probably hadn\u2019t even considered it.This restaurant was only open for Mengmeng, but it seemed like he had already sold it for more than 10 million now, and this 10 million was still a net gain without any cost. Oh, that\u2019s not right, the net profit of excluding the 1 million that he spent to create the membership card, was 9 million!\u201cIt\u2019s time to eat. Mama, let\u2019s hurry over. Hurry.\u201d Mengmeng could not wait any longer as she twisted and urged Zi Yan in her arms.\u201cAlright, alright, alright. Let\u2019s go eat.\u201d Zi Yan laughed very gently, glanced at Zhang Han with her beautiful eyes, and took the lead to walk towards the dining table while carrying Mengmeng.Zhang Li and Zhou Fei were sitting three chairs apart from each other. These three chairs were left for Zhang Han, Zi Yan and Mengmeng.Just as Zi Yan was about to sit down, Zhang Han walked in front of the refrigerator and asked:\u201cWhat do you drink?\u201dZhang Han didn\u2019t prepare the milk at night. Although the milk was very tasty, drinking some wine at this kind of time was more amorous.\u201cRemy Martin or Lafite?\u201d Zhang Li said casually.Thesee were what Zhang Li drank frequently in public.\u201cNope.\u201dZhang Han shook his head and said, \u201cThe red wine has no preparation. There are only beer, black beer, white beer, fruit wine, RIO cocktails, cola, and fruit juice.\u201d\u201cI drink RIO cocktails.\u201d Zi Yan said.Zi Yan only drank a little bit of red wine, it was just that there was nothing here.The RIO cocktail wasn\u2019t high, it was only a few degrees and had all sorts of flavors. It was slightly similar to a drink, but it was still a bit intoxicating after drinking too much.\u201cThen I\u2019ll drink RIO too.\u201dZhang Li and Zhou Fei also added.Therefore, Zhang Han took out six bottles of RIO cocktail and took out two bottles of Little Baiwei beer for himself.\u201cTime to eat, time to eat.\u201d Mengmeng shouted happily.\u201cEn, let\u2019s eat.\u201d Zi Yan glanced at Zhang Li and hesitated for a moment. In the end, She still unbuttoned his coat.Originally, the moment where the goddess took off her clothes was the moment to attract attention. However, it seemed that both Zhou Fei and Zhang Li\u2019s gaze was focused on the dish in front of them.But Zhang Han still saved her a lot of face, and looked towards Zi Yan.When they entered the room, Zhou Fei had already taken off her jacket, while Zi Yan had been wearing it the entire time, which actually made Zhang Han feel that it was a little strange.Out of the corner of her eye, Zi Yan noticed that Zhang Han was looking at her, and the corner of her mouth stealthily revealed a faint smile. Under Zhang Han\u2019s gaze, she took off her jacket.The reason she had intentionally dressed up today was also for Zhang Han to give some reaction.She was wearing a black muslin half-sleeve with a V collar. The collar was partly black opaque, and the sleeves around her waist and arms were translucent muslin that hid her indistinct grace.And because the neckline was relatively low, it revealed an unfathomable career line. It had a sexy collarbone, a slender neck, and also a dazzling necklace on the side of the career line.The necklace was made of platinum and the bottom half was decorated with emerald beads. At the bottom was a black heart-shaped object that looked like a small stone.It had to be said that no matter if it was in terms of appearance or figure, Zi Yan was an absolute beauty above ninety-five.Not to mention, her clothes were so sexy, if Li Cheng had seen her clothes that would cause people\u2019s blood to spurt out, he would probably be stupefied.This was also the first time Zi Yan had worn something like this in front of an \u2018outsider\u2019, and because Zhang Han was always nonchalant towards her, his face was filled with an expression of indifference. Zi Yan was displeased, and paid the price, simply wanting to see Zhang Han\u2019s dumbstruck expression.Obviously, she had achieved her goal. In her peripheral vision, she saw that Zhang Han\u2019s gaze was fixated at the location of her career.It was as if saliva was about to flow out of his mouth.\u2018Hmph,what a pig he is.\u2019Zi Yan let out a light snort in his heart, a somewhat complacent look in her eyes.But\u2026 Five seconds \u2026 Ten seconds later, that guy was still staring at her without blinking.\u2018What? Why are you still looking?\u201dZi Yan was a little embarrassed in her heart for a moment.His dumbstruck look was enough to prove her beauty, but did you keep staring at her like this?Zi Yan felt that Zhang Han\u2019s gaze was burning hot, to the point where she felt that her body was somewhat uncomfortable.\u201cWhy is he still watching?\u201d \u2018Could it be that I\u2019m too, too sexy? \u2018Zi Yan secretly sized up Zhang Han from the corner of her eyes.This moment had only happened within a minute. Other than Mengmeng who had her own wing tip nibbling on it, Zhou Fei and Zhang Li were still waiting for their master to speak.But after waiting for a while, Zhang Han still did not speak, and finally, the two of them noticed an abnormality.Zhou Fei saw that Zhang Han\u2019s eyes were wide open, her expression froze, and then laughed out, and joked:\u201cYo yo, where are you looking?\u201d Didn\u2019t you see that Zhang Li and I are here too? \u201d\u201cBrother, that \u2026Are we going to eat? \u201d Zhang Li reminded him from the side, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.It was the first time she saw her brother act like a pig.She was getting so annoyed for her brother. No matter how beautiful her sister-in-law was, why don\u2019t you all go back to your own rooms at night and be romantic? You\u2019re waiting for dinner, what do you mean by looking straight in the eye?\u201cCough, cough.\u201dZhang Han took one last look and retracted his gaze. His expression was very indifferent, and did not seem the least bit embarrassed as he nodded and said: \u201cEat your food, as long as you guys are at ease. There aren\u2019t many rules here.\u201d\u201cEat, eat.\u201dZhou Fei had already been unable to endure it any longer. After Zhang Han finished his words, she quickly picked up a piece of chicken that had a pure fragrance to it and stuffed it into her mouth.Zhang Li followed closely behind, and also picked up a piece of chicken and stuffed it into her mouth.As for Zi Yan, when she smelled the fragrance just now, her appetite was also stirred, and she picked up a piece of meat to taste.As she ate, her eyes froze.The delicate fragrance of the chicken filled her mouth in an instant. The meat was not greasy at all, but had a little bit of muscle strength. The skin on the meat was soft and tender, and had a gelatinous taste.How could the chicken be so fragrant?The few of them had all eaten chicken? There were even better varieties of chicken, but they were never this fragrant.This chicken \u2026The three of them could no longer use words to describe their current state of mind. If they were to say it out loud, it would be akin to eating a piece of chicken. It would be a blissful feeling!But after that, when they ate their first mouthful of rice, when they ate their first mouthful of beans, eggplant, cucumber, and eggs \u2026At this moment, no one spoke anymore. They had truly reached the realm of being silent and eating.Not because they didn\u2019t want to, but because their mouths wouldn\u2019t stop at all.When Zhang Han saw this scene, he shook his head and laughed. In his heart, he did not feel that other people would like to eat his food, because this scene was all within Zhang Han\u2019s expectations.It could also be said that he was tired of seeing this expression.Zhang Han still had not touched his chopsticks to eat yet, but he had taken a big gulp of beer, and his gaze once again drifted towards the deep lines that Zi Yan had.\u2018Good treasure! \u2018Zhang Han sniffed lightly.If these two words were said out loud, people would definitely think that Zhang Han really liked saying that he was good, but in reality, that was not the case.Zhang Han\u2019s gaze was fixated on the black heart-shaped stone on Zi Yan\u2019s necklace the entire time.That black stone was a spirit treasure, a genuine second-stage spirit treasure, and a definitely not weak spirit treasure, in Zhang Han\u2019s opinion!This was also the reason why Zhang Han had been staring at that direction the entire time. When Zhang Han determined whether that rock was the treasure he was looking at, or the strand of scent that the Treasure-sniffing nose had smelled, he guessed that he was probably not far from it.Evidently, in reality, not only Mengmeng had brought luck, even Zi Yan had brought a treasure to this place.As the saying goes, unintentionally inserting a willow branch into the shadows, Zhang Han still did not plan to start searching for a treasure, so the treasure would \u2018deliver it to your doorstep\u2019.It had to be said that whether it was his previous life or his current life, Zhang Han and the treasures were fated to meet.The stone on Zi Yan\u2019s body was a second-stage spirit treasure, a type of crystal.Crystals were something that cultivators needed everyday. The crystals contained the spiritual energy that people needed, and there were also a lot of them in the veins of the Cultivation World. The number of crystals was also incalculable, and they were the equivalent of money in the entire Myriad Worlds.There were different grades of crystals as well, and they were split into top-grade crystals, medium-grade crystal s, low-grade crystal s, and of course, extremely rare top-grade crystals, and there were even legendary Divine Grade crystals. As for low-grade crystal s, the worst one was a first stage spirit treasure, the highest one was a second-stage spirit treasure, and this obsidian crystal was a high-end product from low-grade crystal s.This piece in front of him did not contain much energy, and its size was relatively small, but it was still pure energy. With Zhang Han\u2019s current strength, it was of great use to Zhang Han.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 - obsidian crystalPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euThe obsidian crystal could assist Zhang Han in his cultivation. With such a small piece, although it could not help Zhang Han break through to the middle stage of Qi Cultivating Stage, it could at least help him increase his strength by 30%. However, Zhang Han did not plan to use it for cultivation, because it still had a lot of uses.Do you still remember the Jade-fire dew from the thunder yang tree?The first stage spirit treasure was close to the second stage and could be absorbed, but had to endure a lot of pain, mainly to increase the toughness and strength of the body.The obsidian crystal would make the Jade-fire dew become a very good treasure. One must know, other than the thunder yang tree being a fifth-stage spirit treasure, Zhang Han only had Yuan Qing Tree being a second-stage spirit treasure, so the rest of the Yuan Qing Tree were all Rank 1 spirit treasure.He originally thought that the spirit treasure on Earth would be very rare, but he didn\u2019t expect that in a short span of a week, Zhang Han had already obtained three treasures.Although the two of them were useless, this piece of obsidian crystal had truly made Zhang Han somewhat surprised.It could not only help a Jade-fire dew level up, it could also nourish a pure Yang body. Water could be used to raise the quality of the territory\u2019s spirit water, but only the fifth-stage spirit treasure could be used as a medium to do this. With Zhang Han\u2019s current Qi Refining Stage level, he could count the number of things he could do with one hand.\u2018How do I get this rock from her? \u2018Zhang Han muttered to himself for a bit and decided to wait until the two of them were alone together\u2026 Just ask.After drinking half a bottle of wine, Zhang Han\u2019s gaze kept on floating in the direction of Zi Yan\u2019s line of work. After he came to a conclusion in his heart, Zhang Han retracted his gaze and started to eat dinner.Originally, Zi Yan, Zhou Fei and Zhang Li the three women were not very interested in meat dishes.But at this moment, they really couldn\u2019t control themselves anymore. They felt that they had finally tasted the real chicken during this meal.It was because they were chicken that they did not control their appetite.The meat was red and white, red and white, and the beef, pork, and mutton were generally red.Fish meat, poultry meat was called white meat, and chicken, duck, goose was a type of poultry. Red meat was characterized by the thickness of muscle fibers. Hard, fat content is high, that means eat too much will fat people.White meat is fine muscle fiber, fat content is low, eat a little more does not have a big impact on body fat.This was just a simple example. One must know that if one\u2019s body was fat, they had to be three highs.After eating for a few minutes, they all felt that they were in too much of a hurry, so they slowed down their pace.They looked at each other, saw oil stains at the corners of each other\u2019s mouths, and smiled at each other.\u201cLet\u2019s have a drink.\u201d Zi Yan said as he picked up the bottle of RIO.\u201cCome.\u201d\u201cHaaargh!\u201dThey touched the bottle and drank two mouthfuls.\u201cAiya, Zhang Han, you cooked so well.\u201d Zhou Fei sighed.Her tone was filled with admiration, the mocking tone she often used had already disappeared without a trace.All the gluttons were completely obedient to Zhang Han.After Zhang Li heard this, she nodded her head and said, \u201cBrother, I never thought that you would not only be a kitchen killer, but your current culinary skills, my god, are truly amazing!\u201d\u201cSo delicious.\u201d Zi Yan looked at Zhang Han strangely, then looked at Zhang Li and asked curiously: \u201cWas he a kitchen killer before?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Zhang Li could not help but laugh, and said: \u201cOnce he personally cooked for me, and in the end, we had a day\u2019s loose bowels.\u201dZi Yan smiled slightly and said: \u201cHe\u2019s also like that now. A few days ago, he mysteriously gave me half a bottle of milk-like water and after drinking it, hmph.\u201dAs they spoke, Zi Yan rolled her eyes at Zhang Han.\u201cYou drank it too? I drank it too. My brother said that it was a good thing, but it turned out to be true. My skin is much better now. \u201d Zhang Li said with a smile.\u201cUgh \u2026\u201d Mengmeng, Mengmeng also drank the water. \u201d Mengmeng said with a unclear voice as she ate.\u201cYou, you all drank it?\u201d Zhou Fei\u2019s expression froze, and she even forgot to put the chicken in her mouth for a moment.She carefully sized up Zi Yan a few times. Zhang Li and Mengmeng\u2019s skin was much better than hers.\u201cWuuuuu, Brother-in-law, why didn\u2019t I have it? You don\u2019t have to be so biased, do you? \u201d Zhou Fei said with a wronged expression: \u201cI want one too, you get me a bottle too!\u201dIf you have money, then you\u2019re a lord, oh no, if you have treasures, then you\u2019re a lord. At this time, Zhou Fei did not care about Zi Yan\u2019s supercilious look and directly called him brother-in-law.\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d Zi Yan glared at Zhou Fei and said.\u201cI\u2019m not spouting nonsense. Brother-in-law, I want that water. Brother-in-law, you have to get me a bottle. Brother-in-law, I\u2019m begging you.\u201d Zhou Fei ignored his image.What\u2019s the use of an image?To a woman who loved beauty, that kind of water was a sacred relic.Today, Zhang Han had explained to them what real common dishes were. Zhou Fei, this gluttonous fellow, had already submitted to them.Of course, she also knew that if she called him that, Zi Yan wouldn\u2019t actually be angry, but if it was Li Cheng, even if there was a treasure, Zhou Fei would definitely not call him that.After all, these two people were \u2018nameless and real\u2019. With Mengmeng here, there was no problem no matter how you called them.Seeing her expression, Zhang Han muttered to himself for a bit, his gaze floated towards the stone above Zi Yan\u2019s line of work, and said: \u201cI temporarily don\u2019t have that kind of water, but there will be one soon, at that time I\u2019ll give all of you to drink some.\u201dA few people\u2019s gazes were gathered on Zhang Han\u2019s face, and they could clearly see where his eyes were looking at.But Zhou Fei did not say anything now, and even hoped that he would look more closely at Zi Yan, no, take Zi Yan down!If that was the case, would she have such a delicious meal in the future? Furthermore, there was also that cosmetics bottle. It was simply worth it!Zhang Li pretended not to see it as she continued to eat the chicken.On the other hand, Zi Yan felt a little awkward, as the place where she was being stared at was extremely hot, to the point that she even wanted to lower his head to take a look at herself.\u2018Is it really that sexy? \u2018Zi Yan was a little happy in his heart, a little embarrassed and a little proud.Zi Yan chose to ignore his gaze and continued eating with her chopsticks extended out.\u201cHehehehe, thank you brother-in-law!\u201d Zhou Fei said while grinning, her eyes looking at the small chicken leg on the plate. Zi Yan\u2019s chopsticks were reaching towards the chicken leg, and seeing that, Zhou Fei\u2019s speed was extremely fast, she immediately extended them out and placed it in Zhang Han\u2019s bowl, laughing and saying: \u201cBrother-in-law, you eat chicken leg, brother-in-law will cook such a sumptuous and delicious dinner for us, it\u2019s hard on you!\u201dFrom Zhou Fei\u2019s current appearance, if it was the man\u2019s identity,s he would look like an old eunuch serving the emperor!When Zi Yan saw this scene, her expression stiffened on the spot.The chopsticks had reached in front of the dish, but the chicken leg that she was going to pick up had fallen into Zhang Han\u2019s bowl.Zi Yan slowly turned her head, looked at Zhou Fei, and said without knowing whether to laugh or cry:\u201cFei Fei, you sold your sister for a bottle of water?\u201d\u201cHow is this selling? If you don\u2019t believe me, ask Mengmeng if it is? \u201d Zhou Fei said while grinning.\u201cUgh \u2026\u201d \u201cUh-huh, that\u2019s not it.\u201d Mengmeng said, cooperating very well.Mengmeng was too focused on eating, there was nothing she could do, the dishes cooked by the PaPa were too delicious, the moment she finished eating the piece of wing, Zhang Han placed his calves in the bowl into Mengmeng\u2019s bowl, thus Mengmeng quickly replied and continued eating.\u201cHumph!\u201dZi Yan rolled her eyes and continued to eat.If it was the type of meat chicken that was relatively oily, they would not eat a lot. However, the chickens from the Mount New Moon, the two chickens, actually all ate up in one go.Of course, this was also partly because Zhang Han had a larger appetite.After eating their fill, Zhang Li and Zhou Fei cleaned up the dining table, Zi Yan hugged Mengmeng and played around on the sofa, while Zhang Han tidied up the kitchen, and after a while, the few of them chatted on the sofa.After about half an hour, Zi Yan walked into the main bedroom, where Zhang Han and Mengmeng usually slept.The bedroom was somewhat like a hotel, with a large round bed and a separate bathroom.\u201cWhere\u2019s Mengmeng\u2019s bed?\u201d Zi Yan glanced at Zhang Han and asked.\u201cHeh heh, Mengmeng doesn\u2019t need to sleep on the small bed. Beside the PaPa, Mengmeng likes to sleep on the big bed.\u201d Mengmeng raised her small hand and said.The Little Princess felt that it was very safe to sleep by the PaPa\u2019s side.Zi Yan slightly curled her lips.It wasn\u2019t easy for her to get Mengmeng to sleep on the small bed and to cultivate the child\u2019s independent ability. However, Zhang Han had destroyed this alility within a few days after living with Mengmeng.Looking at Mengmeng\u2019s attitude, if she slept on the small bed today, she would probably start crying.Zi Yan also didn\u2019t want to make Mengmeng unhappy on the first day she returned, so she nodded slightly and said: \u201cThen Mengmeng will sleep on the big bed. Zhang Han, Mengmeng and I will sleep here today. Are there new beddings?\u201cThis was just changed today.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cYes.\u201d Zi Yan nodded, placing Mengmeng on the bed, she said softly: \u201cMengmeng, Mama will sleep with you today, can we go home tomorrow?\u201dThe moment he said this, Zhang Han\u2019s expression paused, and his brows furrowed slightly. When he wanted to speak up, Mengmeng had already opened her mouth:\u201cNo, no, no. Mengmeng is not going back to the big house, you are not going back either.\u201cThen, Mengmeng, are you not accompanying Mama? \u201cCan you bear to let Mama go back alone?\u201d Zi Yan said softly.\u201cNo, Mama will go, Mama will not go.\u201d Seeing that Mama was not joking, her clear large eyes immediately started to fill up with tears, and it looked like tears were about to flow out.\u201cFine, I won\u2019t go, Mengmeng is good, sleep \u2026\u201dSeeing that, Zi Yan immediately tried to coax her.Zhang Han glanced at it, then turned and walked toward the door.\u201cPaPa, PaPa, don\u2019t go.\u201d Mengmeng said softly.Zhang Han immediately paused in his steps and returned to the bedside.Mengmeng was lying in the middle, Zi Yan was lying on the left side, and Zhang Han was lying on the right side.Mengmeng\u2019s favorite people were PaPa and Mama by her side.Zi Yan told a story for a while, before Mengmeng finally fell asleep with a ease.\u201cLet\u2019s go out.\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s voice was extremely soft. After saying a few words to Zhang Han, he quietly walked outside.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 - Zi Yan returnedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cFine, fine, fine. Your dad is the best.\u201dZhang Li could not help but saying this.But when they got on the car, Zhang Li looked around and said in surprise: \u201cBrother, you have modified this car?\u201dFrom the various details, Zhang Li could tell that the items inside were worth a lot.The driver\u2019s seat, navigation equipment, air conditioning, seats, skylights, etc. These were not some common car could have.\u201cYes, it\u2019s been modified.\u201dZhang Han started up the car, and the sound of the engine was very soft as well. When he drove the car out, Zhang Han continued: \u201cI bought some Audi A8L pieces, and spent two million.\u201d\u201cGod\u2026\u201d Zhang Li laughed and shook her head.Because Mengmeng was on the car, Zhang Han\u2019s speed was not fast, it was very smooth.If he slowed down, he won\u2019t get to the airport too early.At the same time, at Xiang Jiang\u2019s International Airport.The flight from Lin Hai City had arrived.Wearing a thin overcoat and a mask, Zi Yan and Zhou Fei got off the plane and walked towards the exit.\u201cWhere\u2019s Zhang Han?\u201dZi Yan\u2019s gaze swept back and forth a few times, but she did not find any trace of Zhang Han within the crowd.\u201cIt can\u2019t be that guy isn\u2019t here, right?\u201d Zhou Fei said suspiciously: \u201cHe only has Mengmeng in his eyes, no places left for you, he definitely did not come, that\u2019s really not cool\u201dWith just one sentence, it made Zi Yan somewhat speechless.What a nice saying, \u2018He only had Mengmeng his eyes.Even if it\u2019s the truth, how can you be so straightforward?Zi Yan was a little distracted at this moment. She felt that that bastard seemed to be really like that.\u201cThis bastard!\u201d I\u2019m calling him right now! \u201dZi Yan snorted.Facing Zhang Han, she sometimes suspected that her charm had dropped. Why was that fellow always staring at Mengmeng? He only glanced at her a few times when he was checking her out.But this time \u2026 Humph.Zi Yan tightened her outer garment, a look of confidence appearing in her eyes.This time, Zi Yan had purposely dressed up, believing that she would be able to blown that bastard\u2019s mind!Very quickly, the phone connected. Zi Yan immediately asked in a questioning tone:\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come? Where are you? Didn\u2019t you promise to come and pick me up? You don\u2019t keep your word \u2026. \u201cOh, okay, I know. I just got off the plane. I\u2019m going to the parking lot now.\u201d\u201cElder Sister Yan, why are you not gentle suddenly? hahaha, is there a problem between you and that guy? \u201d Zhou Fei said with a mischievous smile.\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, I am as usual.\u201d Zi Yan spat lightly.Elder Sister Yan, you are usually keeping a distance from others, and you are normal to me, but you are abnormal to that guy. Didn\u2019t you notice that the time you two talk over the phone has gotten longer and longer? Zhou Fei curled his lips and said.\u201cIs that so?\u201d Zi Yan was slightly taken aback.Seems like it\u2019s true. At first it was only one minute, then two minutes \u2026 Fifteen minutes.Could it be \u2026 did she really treat him differently?Zi Yan didn\u2019t know what kind of feelings he had towards Zhang Han, but it was possible that she had thoughts of letting nature take its course.\u201cZi Yan, you\u2019re back.\u201dWhile Zi Yan was deep in thought, a voice suddenly came from the front.Raising her head, she saw Li Cheng, who was dressed in expensive formal attire with a jade-like appearance, Young Master Li, welcoming her with a smile.\u201cSorry, my father had urgent matters which needed me to handle a few days ago. That\u2019s why I left Lin Hai without saying goodbye. I have a guilty conscience, so I specially prepared a banquet for you at the Incense Pavilion today.\u201dLi Cheng\u2019s words were very straightforward, and carried a warm smile on his face. His words and actions were truly flawless.However, when Zi Yan faced Li Cheng, that cold expression once again overflowed onto her exquisite face.\u201cYoung Master Li, I\u2019m sorry, I still have things to do tonight.\u201d Zi Yan slightly shook her head and tactfully rejected.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Zi Yan, you\u2019re on vacation tomorrow, so we can celebrate as much as we can tonight. Furthermore, I have specially prepared this for you, and I have some other friends here tonight as well. I told them that I would definitely be able to invite you over, Zi Yan. Li Cheng said with a light smile.Under normal circumstances, if it was any other artist in the company who agreed with Li Cheng\u2019s words, as long as there was a start to such things, it would be certain that he would get his woman into bed.It\u2019s just that Zi Yan was not an ordinary person.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have an appointment tonight, and my friend is here to pick me up.\u201d Zi Yan shook her head again.\u201cOh? Is that so? How about calling your friends over? Isn\u2019t it more lively with more people? \u201d Li Cheng was a little unhappy in his heart, but he still maintained a smile on his face as he said that.\u201cMy friend doesn\u2019t like liveliness. Young Master Li, he\u2019s still waiting for me. I should go.\u201dAfter Zi Yan finished speaking, she wanted to walk to the gate of the airport. Zhou Fei followed behind her without saying anything.Upon seeing this, Li Cheng frowned, and secretly clenched his teeth. When Zi Yan and Zi Yan had walked forward five meters, Li Cheng sneered, and quickly followed. When he was talking to Zi Yan, a hypocritical smile appeared on his face, and he said:A few years ago, I was a fan of yours, but when I was studying abroad, I was unable to get acquainted with you. Now that I have the chance to get to know you, I made repeated invitations to you, but you \u2026 It seems like there are some misunderstandings between us? \u201dMisunderstandings?Zhou Fei sneered in her heart.In the Royal Entertainment Company, who doesn\u2019t know that Li Cheng is a playboy? He still had the nerve to say that he didn\u2019t have any malicious intentions, why was he so faceless?Zhou Fei mocked Li Cheng in her heart, but these words would never come out of her mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t have any misunderstandings towards you. I don\u2019t like liveliness, and I already have an appointment.\u201d Zi Yan replied coldly.After Li Cheng heard this, the corner of his mouth twitched twice. Resisting the unhappiness in his heart, he said: \u201cZi Yan, you promised me a banquet last time, and I didn\u2019t say anything even if you broke your promise. Now that you\u2019ve rejected me like this, aren\u2019t you being a little too disrespectful?Li Cheng was already on the verge of breaking down. He had always been a bad temper person, and when it came to flirting with beauties, he liked to have a gentle and graceful tune, but here with Zi Yan, got rejected thrice, it made him want to conquer Zi Yan even more. Every time he thought of Zi Yan being suppressed and casually ravaged by him, the excitement in his heart couldn\u2019t be stopped.But it seemed that Zi Yan had never faked it when facing him.\u201cDon\u2019t forget, you are an artist from the Royal Entertainment Company. I have my own ways to deal with you!\u201dLi Cheng thought in his heart.Zi Yan was already somewhat impatient, but Zhou Fei had also noticed Li Cheng\u2019s expression. Even though she did not want to get involved, because she still worked under him.\u201cJust that, this time, Elder Sister Yan really has an appointment with us, next time when we have the chance, we will definitely come. Young master Li, look, we have already signed a 3 year contract in Royal Entertainment Company, there\u2019s still a long time left for us to meet.\u201dZhou Fei\u2019s words made Li Cheng\u2019s expression change a little bit, then he laughed and shook his head, and said:\u201cLittle Fei, I like what you said. Since Zi Yan has an appointment this time, I won\u2019t force you. Little Fei is right, there\u2019s still a long time left.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you for your understanding, Young Master Li.\u201d Zi Yan said indifferently as she led the way out of the airport\u2019s front door.Li Cheng had also drove here, and the place where he had stopped was in the same direction as the place where Zhang Han would stop, so the three of them walked towards the right together.Seeing Li Cheng following beside her, Zi Yan could not help but frown.Li Cheng was full of himself.\u201cI heard that your MV shot was pretty successful. congratulations, and will soon be released. I think Zi Yan is going to get popular again.\u201d\u201cThe quality of the MV is not bad.\u201d Zhou Fei smiled and nodded, then said: \u201cI hope this time will allow Elder Sister Yan to attract a wave of fans, and it will be enough for everyone to see Zi Yan has returned.\u201dThe corner of Li Cheng\u2019s mouth curled into a cold smile, and continued to speak passionately:\u201cI believe that Zi Yan can definitely do it. There aren\u2019t many people who work as hard as her right now.\u201dJust as Li Cheng finished speaking, the eyes of Zi Yan, who was looking to the side, lit up, and she walked forward faster.A dozen of meters in front, Zhang Han was walking over from the side.\u201cYou are back.\u201d After arriving near, Zhang Han said while nodding his head.\u201cYes.\u201d Zi Yan replied.Although it was only the word \u201cyes\u201d, the tone of this word made Li Cheng feel unhappy, because this \u201cyes\u201d answer was not stiff at all. In fact, even the aura of coldness had lessened by a lot.Who was this person?Li Cheng was unhappy, he checked Zhang Han out and felt that his words and actions were nothing more than ordinary. He laughed lightly, then took out an cigarette, and lit up one by himself, and after taking a deep breath, he casually took one out and handed it over to Zhang Han, and said lazily: \u201cLittle brother, do you smoke? Zi Yan said that she had an appointment, and I thought that it was someone from her circle. Heh, seeing that little brother is a little unfamiliar, so you are? \u201dLi Cheng\u2019s tone was superior, and her words held the initiative. Usually, at times like this, people will be led by him.But then, Zhang Han just turned his head and looked at the cigarette, and then raised his head and looked at Li Cheng, and then Zhang Han turned and said:\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he took the lead and walked towards the side, leaving Li Cheng who was still holding onto his cigarette, with a stiff face.Don\u2019t say anything? Ignoring him? What do you mean?Li Cheng was so confused that he almost exploded with anger at the same time.He was a dignified young master Li, when had he ever been treated like this?Liked it?

    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - Astonishing turnoverPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euZhang Han followed Zi Yan to the living room. When they returned to the first floor, they found Zhou Fei and Zhang Li chatting very happily.The two\u2019s personalities were about the same. Zhou Fei was the typical sabre mouth, it could be said that her mouth was mean, and sometimes she liked to mock people. But Zhang Li, although her temper wasn\u2019t as sharp as it was in the past, she had never spoiled anyone, and would directly say whenever she saw something bad.How could it ever make Zhang Li swallow her anger? Just like half a month ago, another DJ in the bar wanted to hit on Zhang Li, but after being scolded by Zhang Li, the head of the bar finally decided to fire him.Zhang Li was more favored in the bar, as a beauty. There were still many fans who came to visit her.Zhou Fei and Zi Yan had a relationship, because Zi Yan was a little cool when she was working, she did not want to argue with others. Zhou Fei also understood the principle that people liked to bully kind people, so her identity was like Zi Yan\u2019s shield.The two of them sat on the sofa and chatted for a while. They noticed that the other person had something to say, so they both had a good impression of each other.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I also hate those people who are intentionally flirting with each other \u2026\u201dZhou Fei was currently spitting spittle from her mouth with waving hands and feet. After seeing Zi Yan and Mu Yurou walk down, Zhou Fei stopped what she was saying, looked at Zi Yan and Zhang Han, and joked:\u201cTsk tsk tsk, you came down so quickly?\u201d \u201cAiyo, I thought it would take you guys a while to get down from your room.\u201d\u201cZhou Fei!\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s beautiful eyes widened, and said: \u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting, I, I\u2019ll sew your mouth shut!\u201d\u201cHehehehe, this is just a joke.\u201d Zhou Fei smiled and said: \u201cElder Sister Yan, come sit over here.\u201dZi Yan gave a light snort and sat on the left side of Zhou Fei, while Zhang Han sat on the right side of her.\u201cSister, how is it? Is the food that I made okay? \u201d Zhang Han said with a smile.\u201cOkay?\u201d Zhou Fei opened her eyes wide and took the lead to say: \u201cThis is simply the most fragrant meal I\u2019ve ever eaten in my life. It\u2019s really, really delicious, Brother-in-law \u2026 Oh no, Elder Sister Yan, why are you pinching me? Cough cough, that\u2026 Zhang Han, how did you cook your food? \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a normal dish, but the ingredients are good, so the taste is good.\u201d Zhang Han replied indifferently.\u201cGood ingredients?\u201d If the ingredients are good, it would also be easy to create a nasty meal. To be able to cook so well, it can be said that elder brother\u2019s skills are very high. \u201d Zhang Li said with a smile.Hearing this, Zhang Han laughed lightly, and said: \u201cIf you think it\u2019s not bad, then you can stay and serve me some dishes.\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d Zhang Li shook her head and said: \u201cAnyway, you bought me Maserati GT, I just need to drive here to eat every day. I usually wake up at 11 o\u2019clock and pack up, driving here is only at 12: 30, and it just happens to be right in time for you to cook.Zhang Han laughed helplessly, he did not have any other intentions of persuading her. Since his sister likes it, then he might as well go and play.\u201cZhang Li, what kind of work are you doing?\u201d Zi Yan asked somewhat curiously.\u201cI\u2019m the bar\u2019s DJ artist.\u201d Zhang Li replied with a smile.\u201cYou know DJ, pretty good.\u201d Zi Yan chuckled. DJ naturally belonged to the same type of music, and as both of them were music lovers, Zi Yan felt that they would have some common topics to talk about.\u201cEh? \u201cThat\u2019s not right!\u201d At this time, Zhou Fei\u2019s eyes paused, looked at Zhang Han with suspicion, and said:\u201cZhang Li said that you bought a bright Maserati GT for her. That would cost more than two million.\u201d\u201cThree million five hundred thousand.\u201d Zhang Li curled her lips and replied.\u201cThree million five hundred thousand?\u201d Zhou Fei stared blankly, and said with a slightly astonished tone: \u201cReally? Zhang Han, why did you drive a car of panda car with so much money? \u201d\u201cBecause Mengmeng liked that car a lot, so I bought it.\u201dZhang Han\u2019s plain answer made Zi Yan sigh softly in her heart.In the few days that she had been out and chatting with Mengmeng, she had felt that the Little Princess was extremely reliant on her father. But today, seeing her for real, the Little Princess was simply too tired of Zhang Han.Zi Yan started to worry in her heart. Just as her mind was about to wander, Zhang Li\u2019s words caught her attention.Zhang Li laughed lightly and said: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the panda, it doesn\u2019t look nice. Furthermore, my brother spent two million on the panda.\u201d\u201cPuff \u2026\u201d Zhou Fei almost choked on her saliva. She looked at Zhang Han, dumbstruck. Two million? \u201cI have to say, he\u2019s so strong. He\u2019s a rich young master after all. He\u2019s so rich!\u201dNot to mention how much she spent to open the restaurant, two million for a modified car, three million and five hundred thousand for a Maserati, that was five million and five hundred thousand already. Didn\u2019t they say that Zhang Han had already fallen to despair a few days ago? He had lived in a run-down apartment for more than four years, how did he become rich after meeting Mengmeng? Could it be his previous private money?This made Zhou Fei a little surprised.Not only her, but even Zi Yan looked at Zhang Han with a bit of surprise.After selling the house of rent and renting a hill, he did not have much money left after cleaning everything up. In the few days that she had been gone, how did Zhang Han get so much money again? Spending five million wasn\u2019t a cheap price either.Seeing the curious expressions of the two, Zhang Li said in a somewhat proud tone:\u201cHeh heh, you guys don\u2019t know about this, right? Let me tell you, my brother is really amazing. When you entered earlier, you didn\u2019t see the notice board. In this restaurant, do you know how much my brother sold for a membership card? \u201d\u201cHow much can a membership card cost? Tens of thousands?\u201d Zhou Fei said as her mouth twitched.Ordinarily speaking, a normal restaurant\u2019s membership card would cost around 100 yuan each, slightly higher grade 800 yuan, high class restaurants would only cost 1800 yuan, luxurious restaurants would also cost tens of thousands of yuan, and these money, no matter how much they sold it, they couldn\u2019t make 5 million in a few days, right?However, Zhang Li\u2019s following answer stunned the two of them.\u201cNo no no!\u201d Aren\u2019t you underestimating my brother too much? \u201d Zhang Li shook her index finger back and forth, and without any suspense, she directly said: \u201cMy brother\u2019s membership cards, one million each, and each one is at the special price of the top ten! From the eleventh to the twentieth, the membership card is ten million!\u201dWhen these words came out, Zhou Fei was dumbfounded, even Zi Yan was staring at Zhang Han in shock.\u201cAlso, my brother bought all ten special offers.\u201d Zhang Li added on the most important part.The price of a membership card didn\u2019t mean anything. It didn\u2019t matter if you bought it for 10,000 yuan, 1 million yuan, or even 10 million yuan.\u201cThe first ten are all sold? \u201cOh my god, that means the restaurant has already earned 10 million.\u201dZhou Fei was shocked for a moment, then she shook her head and said: \u201cI am convinced today that I will sell my one million membership card. Sigh, this is also within reason, your food is so fragrant, it would be weird if I do not sell it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I really didn\u2019t expect that the food you cook would be so delicious.\u201d Zi Yan said as she looked at Zhang Han with a complicated expression.However, Zhang Han treated Mengmeng so well, loved her so much, and if she were to forcefully take Mengmeng away, and deprive her of the sweet fatherly love she should have, isn\u2019t that a little too cruel?But if he did not bring Mengmeng with him, if this continued, then what if Zhang Han found someone else? Will Mengmeng leave me at that time?This was a problem that Zi Yan had always been worried about. If this problem wasn\u2019t resolved, Zi Yan\u2019s heart would always be in such a mess.Zhang Han chuckled as he looked at Zi Yan, and said: \u201cThe ingredients were cultivated from the Mount New Moon you saw last time.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s gaze seemed to drift, as the scene of the Mount New Moon appeared in her mind.\u201cAlso, my brother\u2019s restaurant is only open for business for 3 hours every day, and the food sold here is\u2026\u201d Zhang Li told her all the information on the signboard at the door.This caused Zhou Fei to exclaim in shock.By the time the conversation reached 12: 30 PM, everyone\u2019s mood had dropped and they were all planning to rest.\u201cBrother, you can\u2019t stay here anymore, right? I\u2019ll stay at a hotel not far from here. I\u2019ll come over tomorrow morning. \u201d Zhang Li thought for a while, then stood up and said.Looking at Zhang Han and Zi Yan\u2019s situation, there seemed to be a small problem. Regardless of actions or actions, they did not seem to be husband and wife, and according to what Zhang Han had said, Zhang Li obviously felt that it was odd, so she did not plan to join the fun in the restaurant, and prepared to go to the hotel. did not dare to make any noise at all.\u201cThen I will also go and stay at the hotel. Elder Sister Yan, you stay here with Mengmeng.\u201d Zhou Fei stood up and said.\u201cNo.\u201d Zi Yan pulled Zhou Fei\u2019s hand.Living with Zhang Han, Zi Yan had a kind of awkward feeling. After all, she had nothing to do with Zhang Han, and if not for that accident, the two of them might still be passersby. Furthermore, leaving Zi Yan here, she would have felt a little anxious in her heart, even though she wanted to have a good chat with Zhang Han.Seeing that Zhang Han, Zhou Fei and Zhang Li were all looking at her, Zi Yan felt a little awkward in her heart, but her expression was still calm, and said: \u201cZhou Fei, you stay behind with me.\u201d\u201cWhy should I accompany you? Didn\u2019t you want to accompany Mengmeng? \u201d Zhou Fei asked curiously.\u201cJust sleep by my side, and accompany me with Mengmeng.\u201d Zi Yan said while looking at Zhou Fei very seriously.Seeing Zi Yan\u2019s expression, Zhou Fei knew that she had to agree.However, before she could even open her mouth, Zhang Han had already directly said:\u201cAll of you stay here. Zhou Fei and Zi Yan will accompany Mengmeng.\u201cThen what about you, brother?\u201d Zhang Li hesitated.\u201cI\u2019ll be on the sofa.\u201dZhang Han casually replied.After some discussion, Zhang Li and Zhou Fei finally decided to stay. Zhang Han let the two of them go and rest.They nodded and went upstairs. They knew that the two of them had something to say.Liked it?

    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 - You are not safePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euAfter the two of them left, Zhang Han and Zi Yan looked at each other.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dSuddenly, both of them opened their mouths at the same time and stopped at the same time.After that, they did not say the following sentence: \u201cYou speak first.\u201dZhang Han said straightforwardly: \u201cYou want to bring Mengmeng back tomorrow?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zi Yan nodded.\u201cI don\u2019t agree.\u201d Zhang Han frowned slightly.\u201cYou don\u2019t agree?\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s willow leaf eyebrows also slightly raised, and said with an unfriendly tone: \u201cI do not need your consent, Mengmeng is mine, I want to take her away, so I will take her with me!\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m her father.\u201d Zhang Han looked straight at Zi Yan and said.He could not understand, why did Zi Yan always wanted to bring Mengmeng away?\u201cSo what if you\u2019re his father? Have you taken care of Mengmeng since you were young? Did you take care of me when I\u2019m pregnant? Do you know how painful it is to have a baby? \u201d Zi Yan\u2019s voice turned cold. \u201cZhang Han, I\u2019m telling you, I want to take Mengmeng away, I don\u2019t need your permission!\u201dWith that, the atmosphere on the stage turned cold. The two of them looked at each other.With Zhang Han\u2019s temperament, if it were anyone else speaking to him like that, he would have long ago punished them a bit. But facing Zi Yan, he really had no solution.The hard part was that he definitely couldn\u2019t do it anymore. There was no other way, he could only use the soft part.Zhang Han laughed bitterly, shook his head and said: \u201cWhy do you want to bring Mengmeng away? Mengmeng can get the best care from here. If you want to work, you don\u2019t have time to take care of her. \u201d\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d Zi Yan said with a light snort.\u201cThere has to be a reason, right?\u201d Zhang Han asked seriously.\u201cJust because I\u2019m Mengmeng\u2019s mother, I also want to be with her. Moreover, it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t bring her away, I\u2019ll get Aunt Wang to send her back for the three meals I have everyday.\u201d Zi Yan said a little stiffly, with a trace of determination in her voice.\u201cWhat you said is very simple.\u201d Zhang Han leaned his body on the sofa and said: \u201cYou can stay here, and move in. There are two bedrooms upstairs, it\u2019s more than enough.\u201dAfter Zi Yan hearing this, she was stunned for a moment before subconsciously rejecting, \u201cNo.\u201dAt the same time, she was feeling slightly flustered.He wanted me to come live with him? What did he mean? You want to pursue yourself?Move in here? Living with Zhang Han?For a moment, Zi Yan felt that this was a good choice. In here, Mengmeng would truly be very happy, but soon after, she felt that it would definitely not be possible to move in this way without knowing why.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t it working anymore?\u201d Zhang Han said somewhat helplessly.Why did she say no, then no, what did she want to do?\u201cIf I say no, then no. There\u2019s no reason why.\u201d Zi Yan replied.Regarding Mengmeng, Zi Yan felt that she had to be strong.\u201cZi Yan.\u201d Zhang Han sat up, stared at her, and said word by word. \u201cI will definitely not let you take Mengmeng away, you must tell me the reason why I want to take Mengmeng away now, if there are any problems, I will solve them, okay?\u201dZi Yan\u2019s body suddenly jerked. She stared at Zhang Han for a while, feeling wronged in her heart.Her dream was to have a good family, a good husband, and Mengmeng. But now, when Mengmeng was accidentally born, she still had to argue with him over and over again.Zi Yan was quiet for a long time, before she finally spoke out her thoughts. She had been holding it in for a few days, and it made her feel very uncomfortable.Therefore, she spoke with a slightly aggrieved tone:\u201cIt\u2019s not safe.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s not safe?\u201d Zhang Han asked in disbelief.\u201cYou\u2019re not safe, yes, you\u2019re not!\u201d Zi Yan said in a slightly downcast tone: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a mistake to let Mengmeng meet with you. Mengmeng wants father, I promise her, but Mengmeng is relying more and more on you now, this won\u2019t do, I cannot lose Mengmeng, she is my everything, by relying on you, what if you find a new girlfriend, what will I do? Mengmeng chose to follow you, what should I do? Have you thought about this before? I can\u2019t lose Mengmeng, so I can\u2019t let her be too close to you. \u201dWhile talking, Zi Yan\u2019s eyes were slightly red, revealing her true feelings.As for Zhang Han, he had a sudden realisation.So this was what she was worried about.Then, Zhang Han chuckled, he moved his body closer to Zi Yan, stared at her, and said gently:\u201cZi Yan, I know how much you love Mengmeng, and I won\u2019t let Mengmeng leave your side. Don\u2019t worry, this definitely won\u2019t happen, you can let Mengmeng stay here without worry.\u201dZhang Han was at a loss whether to laugh or cry in his heart. Forget about him finding a girlfriend, with Mengmeng\u2019s tyrannical strength, if a woman other than Zi Yan approached him, the little princess would have issued a warning.\u201cNo.\u201d Zi Yan slightly lowered his head, and softly refused.After saying those words, she felt a lot more relaxed in her heart. At the same time, she hoped that Zhang Han would understand her actions.\u201cThen let\u2019s do it like this.\u201d Zhang Han laughed bitterly, knowing that Zi Yan did not have a sense of security, so he decided to leave her with a sense of security. Therefore, Zhang Han pondered for a moment, and said: \u201cIn order to prevent the situation that you imagined from happening, before you find the other half, I will not look for any woman. I will not bring a stepmother to Mengmeng.At this time, Zi Yan raised her head, her beautiful eyes were fixated on Zhang Han. After a moment of silence, she opened her mouth and replied:\u201cNo.\u201dAlthough she refused, but her tone had already become a lot softer.\u201cWhy is it still not working?\u201d\u201cI will make you swear, swear that I will only be able to make Mengmeng stay here temporarily.\u201d Zi Yan pouted, and said somewhat stubbornly and willfully.\u201cSwear? Sure!\u201dZhang Han let out a light cough, and looked at Zi Yan with a very solemn gaze. Just as he was about to speak, he was interrupted by Zi Yan:\u201cNo, you swear you will have to stick your finger out? Why don\u2019t you have any sincerity at all?\u201dUnknowingly, Zi Yan\u2019s tone already had a hint of spoiled child and a woman\u2019s charm.Perhaps this was the reason why the woman vented the emotions in her heart, and why her body and mind were relaxed after hearing Zhang Han\u2019s words.\u201cGood, good, good.\u201dZhang Han didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, as he stretched out the three fingers of his right hand upwards. Zhang Han and Zi Yan looked at each other, his gaze very solemn.\u201cIn order to make Mengmeng stay, in order to give Zi Yan a sense of security, I, Zhang Han, swear here that before Zi Yan finds the other half, I, Zhang Han, will not find any other woman nor bring a stepmother to Mengmeng. If I violate the oath, I will be bombarded by the divine thunder over the sky for ten thousand years!\u201d Zhang Han said with a serious face.This oath was already very, very heavy.The divine thunder over the sky was the legendary heavenly tribulation that one would encounter during the heavenly tribulation period.Heavenly tribulation was related to talent, and could be said to be proportional to one\u2019s talent. For ordinary talents, they would only be able to undergo ordinary heavenly tribulation. Those with better talent might be able to attract baleful wind and thunder.To be able to attract tribulation lightning, it was clear that this person was a genius. He remembered that the previous time when the Cultivation World invited heavenly tribulation, the strongest one was the Netherworld Immortal Monarch.He cultivated in the dark arts, slaughtering tens of thousands of people at every turn and absorbing blood essence to assist his cultivation. However, when he crossed heavenly tribulation, he drew the attention of the Five Element Divine Thunder, turning into nothing but dregs.As for Zhang Han, when the Han Yang Immortal was undergoing his heavenly tribulation, billions of dao friends watched from afar. When they realized that it was the legendary divine thunder over the sky, they were completely shocked.He remembered that the last time, when the devils attracted the attention of the Ninth Heaven, was a million years ago. A long time had passed, and the legend of the divine thunder over the sky was left behind.At the same time, everyone lamented the fact that the Han Yang Immortal had done something so heinous that it provoked the attacks of the heavens.In the end, Zhang Han was not able to block and was reborn.In front of him, Zi Yan was startled when she heard Zhang Han\u2019s oath.\u201cPuchi \u2026\u201d Zi Yan could not help but burst out laughing. She glanced at Zhang Han with her beautiful eyes and said: \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? I think you\u2019re just fooling me. \u201dAt this moment, Zi Yan\u2019s heart finally calmed down, and for a moment, she felt an indescribable happiness. The things that she had been worried about for a long time had finally been resolved.Although she did not know what divine thunder over the sky was, Zhang Han\u2019s oath was quite useful to her.\u201cI\u2019m not trying to fool you. No, how do you want me to swear? I swear, okay?\u201d Zhang Han laughed bitterly.She was Mengmeng\u2019s mother, so being forceful would definitely not work. He could only follow her path and follow her rhythm.This made Zhang Han feel that not only did he have to be coaxed by his cute daughter after his rebirth, he also had to be coaxed by his spicy mother.Seeing Zhang Han\u2019s expression, Zi Yan could not help but burst out laughing. When Zi Yan smiled, it was extremely beautiful, and her eyes shone as she looked at Zhang Han and said: \u201cAlright, alright, I trust you? Look at your troubled look, hmph, that\u2019s a good thing, you\u2019re not allowed to find a stepmother for Mengmeng. \u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head helplessly.Then I\u2019ll let Mengmeng stay here for the time being. I\u2019ll let you take advantage of me, I still need to run two side. Zi Yan pouted and said.\u201cThen move in.\u201d Seeing that the matter had been resolved, Zhang Han was relieved, and casually said while leaning on the sofa.His casual words caused Zi Yan to be slightly stunned.\u2018He\u2019s inviting me to move in? \u2018\u2018He wants to live with me? \u2018\u2018What does he mean? \u2018\u2018Is it to woo me? \u2018\u2018What do I do\u2026 I, I haven\u2019t thought about it yet.\u201dAt this moment, Zi Yan\u2019s heart was in turmoil, and her face was a little hot.\u2018This is bad. My face is so hot! \u2018\u2018What do I do? I blush. What does he do when he sees me.\u2019\u2018Will he think I\u2019m shy, or will he let his imagination run wild\u2026 \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t like him at all, and blushing isn\u2019t the right thing to do\u2026 \u2018Not to mention that Zhang Han had not let his imagination run wild, the more Zi Yan blushed the more she felt, the more her face became flushed.Her big eyes blinked rapidly and her face was slightly red. She was drooling and drooling, just like a lovely little daughter-in-law.Zhang Han did not think too much about it. After seeing Zi Yan\u2019s appearance, he said: \u201cAre you hot? Would you like me to bring you something to drink? \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s indeed a little hot. Then let\u2019s drink a bottle of it.\u201d Zi Yan nodded lightly.Zhang Han stood up and walked towards the refrigerator.Hu \u2026Zi Yan let out a long breath and patted her chest. After calming himself down, Zi Yan secretly snorted, thinking that he had lost too much face just because of one sentence from Zhang Han.Liked it?

    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - GiftPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euVery quickly, Zhang Han brought over a can of cola and a can of beer.\u201cTake a sip.\u201dZhang Han opened the bottle and handed it over to Zi Yan. Then, he lifted up the bottle of beer and touched it with Zi Yan\u2019s cola.Zi Yan looked at the smiling Zhang Han in a daze. At this moment, she felt that Zhang Han was actually quite handsome.One of the Four Young Masters of the Shang Jing who used to be insufferably arrogant had become such a carefree person, which made Zi Yan feel a little emotional.Gurgle gurgle.After drinking two large gulps of cola, Zi Yan completely suppressed the complicated feelings in her heart, and her entire being relaxed.\u201cMhmm.\u201dZi Yan stood up and stretched, then said lazily: \u201cI\u2019ve been really busy these past few days, and I can finally relax.\u201dLittle did she know that when she stretched in front of Zhang Han, her enchanting figure was completely exposed, with her protruding front and back as well as her peerlessly beautiful face.\u2018She\u2026 \u2018Compared to the looks of the\u2019s Holy Maiden, they were not any inferior.Zhang Han praised in his heart. Looking at the time, it was almost one in the morning, Zhang Han muttered to himself, planning to ask Zi Yan about the obsidian crystal on her necklace.\u201cHuh?\u201d Zi Yan suddenly exclaimed, and said: \u201cYou took a photo of Mengmeng? It\u2019s so beautiful! \u201dZi Yan\u2019s gaze fell upon the pictures on the wall of the piano, and due to her curiosity, she walked over.\u201cYes, it was taken a few days ago.\u201d Zhang Han replied, he put down the beer, got up and followed her.\u201cSo beautiful.\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s eyes were full of love. Her daughter was so beautiful, but as a mother, she was very happy.However, when she saw the picture of Zhang Han and Mengmeng, she was immediately stunned.\u201cThe two of you look good together.\u201d Zi Yan pouted and said.It was true that the picture was pretty, but Zi Yan started to feel jealous.There were only Mengmeng\u2019s and Zhang Han\u2019s pictures in the room, but not hers.Mengmeng was her daughter, she was Mengmeng\u2019s Mama. What did the photos not have to do with her?\u201cWhere\u2019s my picture?\u201d Zi Yan remained silent for a while, before suddenly speaking again.\u201cWhat picture?\u201d Zhang Han glanced at Zi Yan and asked.\u201cPut my picture in the frame.\u201d Zi Yan pursed her lips, looked at Zhang Han and said.\u201cOh, okay. I\u2019ll buy a few frames tomorrow and put your photos on the second floor.\u201d Zhang Han laughed lightly.\u201cThat won\u2019t do. I want the photos on the first floor.\u201d Zi Yan pouted, her tone a little stubborn.\u201cThe first floor is full of photos, these are all specially picked out by Mengmeng and I.\u201d Zhang Han looked at her strangely.Isn\u2019t it the same on the second floor?\u201cI don\u2019t care. I want my photos on the first floor.\u201d Zi Yan breathed in slightly in a hurry, and looked straight at Zhang Han, with a gaze that showed that she would not give in at all.\u201cThat won\u2019t do, I agree, Mengmeng would also not agree.\u201d Zhang Han immediately shook his head and rejected.\u201cMengmeng will agree. My photo must be displayed here.\u201d Zi Yan looked at Zhang Han with her clear and large eyes.Her eyes seemed to say, if he did not agree, then Zi Yan would continue to argue here.However, there was also a sense of grievance and depression in her eyes. In this restaurant, if she wanted to fight for a photo, how could she have the appearance of a hostess?It seems\u2026 She is not yet mistress.Zhang Han looked at Zi Yan and was defeated. \u201cAlright, alright, let\u2019s put your photos away, but there are six frames here, you don\u2019t need all of them, right? I\u2019ll just give you a picture frame. \u201d\u201cOne?\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s eyes slowly widened, she snorted lightly, and said: \u201cHow can one be okay? \u201cI need at least four \u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t four too much? Why do you have so many photos? \u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cWhat is it? You hate me? Am I not beautiful? What\u2019s wrong with putting up a few pictures of me? \u201d Zi Yan looked at Zhang Han angrily.\u201cThat\u2019s not it \u2026\u201dZhang Han felt like his head was about to explode.After talking with Zi Yan for a while, it was like talking to a big saw and haggling over the price. In the end, the two of them decided on two photo frames with Zi Yan in them.\u201cHmph, I\u2019ll send you a photo now. You get someone to wash them out, one on the left, one on the right. Do you understand?\u201dIn the end, Zi Yan revealed a victorious smile, took out her phone, and took out two very beautiful self-portrait and sent a message to Zhang Han.Zhang Han took a quick glance and sent a red packet for five hundred yuan over to the members of Shadow Tower, telling them to send the photo over the next day.After settling this matter, Zi Yan was satisfied. She strolled for a bit until she was in front of the piano.\u201cHow did you buy the Steinway?\u201d Zi Yan stretched out her white and tender fingers and gently caressed the piano.\u201cWho said it was for decoration?\u201d Zhang Han laughed helplessly, why does it seem like in Zi Yan\u2019s eyes, he is nothing?\u201cWhat is it? From your tone, you know how to play the piano? \u201d Zi Yan said as she glanced at Zhang Han with her beautiful eyes.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with it.\u201d Zhang Han shook his head and said, \u201cWhen I was eleven years old, I was already at the tenth level of the piano. I didn\u2019t play very well anymore.\u201d\u201cAre you for real?\u201d Zi Yan said in a rather strange tone.Piano was ranked from one to ten, which was just an amateur level classification. It wasn\u2019t difficult to reach level ten, but to go up there required a graduate student from the Music Academy.However, even if he was an amateur, a Level 10 [Body Fusion] was still considered impressive. Zi Yan also felt that since Zhang Han knew piano and loved music, he should have something in common with her.Besides, a man who can play the piano is cool.\u201cWhy would I lie to you?\u201d Zhang Han was speechless.Why didn\u2019t this girl believe him ever since she interacted with Zi Yan again?\u201cThen play the piano for me tomorrow.\u201d Zi Yan said in a slightly bashful manner.\u201cAlright.\u201dZhang Han immediately agreed. He felt that the time was right, and so he once again looked at the obsidian crystal.When Zi Yan saw his gaze, she immediately felt her body becoming somewhat stiff. Twisting her slim waist, she scolded: \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dAlthough her words were true, Zi Yan was still a little proud of herself. The reason she was dressed up like this, wasn actually all for the sake of looking of Zhang Han-the pig brother!\u201cCough, cough.\u201d Zhang Han coughed lightly and said, \u201cYour necklace is pretty good to look at.\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d \u201cSmooth talker.\u201d Zi Yan snorted and walked back to the sofa. After sitting down, she took a sip of the cola and rolled her eyes at Zhang Han.From her point of view, Zhang Han\u2019s explanation was disguised as saying that she had a nice figure. It seemed that she had good eyes, but why did he look like a big log in the past?Zhang Han sat beside Zi Yan. After thinking for a moment, he said directly: \u201cCan you give me your necklace?\u201d\u201cNecklace?\u201dZi Yan was slightly taken aback, and subconsciously asked: \u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s useful to me.\u201d Zhang Han truthfully said.Seeing that Zhang Han was not joking, Zi Yan finally understood that he was really talking about how pretty the necklace was.Thinking to this point, Zi Yan felt a sense of loss.\u201cEh \u2026\u201d Zhang Han sighed lightly, and said with a helpless tone: \u201cIt\u2019s really useful to me, not just to me, Mengmeng, you, or anyone else.\u201dWith obsidian crystal, not only could he evolve a Jade-fire dew into a second-stage spirit treasure, he could also transform a pure Yang. The amount of water in his body increased by several times. This way, Zhang Han could buy some adult animals like cows and sheep, and feed them directly to Pure Yang. Water, before long can be eaten, and it can also indirectly nourish the soil and water of the territory, the use of it is still very big.\u201cThen tell me what it\u2019s used for.\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s tone was a little hesitant. Regarding Mengmeng, she would make the biggest concession possible.\u201cYou only need to know that it can indirectly improve our physiques.\u201d Zhang Han said as he nodded his head slightly.\u201cNo.\u201d Zi Yan rejected her once again.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t it enough?\u201d Zhang Han didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry as he looked at Zi Yan.\u201cYou haven\u2019t even given me a present yet, why should I give you a present first? And this necklace is a souvenir given to me by my grandfather when I was young. \u201d Zi Yan slightly pouted, her tone revealing her dissatisfaction. After meeting for so many days, Zhang Han had never given her a present, nor did he say anything that he cared about.\u201cPresent\u2026 Oh yeah, when Mengmeng and I were shopping, we saw that a piece of clothing was not bad, so we bought it for you. Zhang Han said as he stood up and walked to the second floor.It seems like Mengmeng was about to use the clothes PaPa bought for him.After a while, Zhang Han walked out with a clothing bag in his hand.\u201cTake a look?\u201d Zhang Han laughed and passed it over.At the same time, he felt a little guilty. He thought that Mengmeng forced him to buy this set of clothes, but he had never thought of it this way.\u201cYou really prepared a present for me?\u201dZi Yan\u2019s big eyes faintly shone. With a slightly happy expression, she received the clothing bag, and after taking out the white fur clothes from within, she looked at Zhang Han with an admiring gaze, and said with a slight smile.\u201cHmph hmph, your eyesight isn\u2019t bad. Your clothes are quite pretty. I really like them, thank you.\u201dZhang Han just listened and shook his head, smiling without saying a word.Zi Yan took the clothes and looked around for a while. Then, he put the clothes down, pursed her sexy red lips and muttered to himself.In the end, she raised her slender arm and took off the necklace from her neck. With a reluctant tone, she said.\u201cThen, then I\u2019ll give you this necklace.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dZhang Han didn\u2019t hold back and immediately linked the two. Looking at the black heart-shaped stone, he placed it on his nose and subconsciously took a long sniff at it with his Treasure-sniffing nose.\u2018obsidian crystal\u2026 \u2018The aura of the crystal stone was very familiar to Zhang Han, he squinted his eyes, and his face was filled with infatuation.Zi Yan was startled when she saw his expression, then her charming face immediately flushed red as she looked in another direction with her beautiful eyes flickering.\u2018What is he doing? \u2018\u2018Is he smelling, smelling my body scent? \u2018\u2018Why is he so brazen! \u2018Zi Yan was startled by Zhang Han\u2019s actions, and for a moment, she felt slightly chaotic in her heart.Liked it?

    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - The past is not easy to look back onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euMost of the people Zi Yan came into contact with were people of the upper class. All of them had elegant demeanors and had a face full of righteousness.Even if it was someone like Li Cheng, who thought differently than what he said, they were also usually more polite when they spoke.It was unlike Zhang Han who openly sized up her body and openly looked at the direction of her work line, openly smelling the necklace that was on her body.At this moment, Zi Yan suddenly thought of a popular phrase on the internet: it\u2019s not fake, but it\u2019s a big deal.What it means is that the person you\u2019re teasing might not think this way on the surface, but those who are righteous on the surface might not be able to tell what they are thinking.A man\u2019s heart is separated from his stomach. If one does not speak, who knows what the other will think.Just like Zhang Han and Li Cheng, Zhang Han openly sized up Zi Yan\u2019s body, but he did not have any unnecessary thoughts in his heart. Li Cheng\u2019s face was filled with righteousness, and his heart was full of yearning for Zi Yan.\u201cCan you really play the piano?\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s eyes drifted a little as she looked in the direction of the piano.Zhang Han took a whiff of the necklace\u2019s gesture, which made Zi Yan afraid to look straight into Zhang Han\u2019s eyes. He had already looked over, what did he want to say? Zi Yan did not know, so he tried to find another topic to talk.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han put the necklace back into his pocket and answered with a nod of his head.\u201cThen play it for me.\u201d There was a little anticipation in Zi Yan\u2019s eyes.If Zhang Han really knew how to play the piano, then it meant that he loved music. In Zi Yan\u2019s heart, he liked people who loved music the same.\u201cNo, it\u2019s too late.\u201d Zhang Han shook his head and rejected.\u201cThen we\u2019ll just play a little bit. I think the soundproofing of the second floor\u2019s room is pretty good. A little play shouldn\u2019t affect their sleep.\u201d Zi Yan thought for a while and said.\u201cNo, what if we disturb Mengmeng\u2019s sleep?\u201d Zhang Han refused again. He wouldn\u2019t play the piano while Mengmeng slept.\u201cHmph, alright then. Can you play it for me tomorrow?\u201d Seeing that, Zi Yan also made a concession, she pouted her lips and snorted.This expression on Zi Yan\u2019s face made her, the ice-cold beauty, appear extremely lovely and gentle. However, from the expression on her face, it looked very similar to Mengmeng\u2019s expression every now and then.Looking at Zi Yan\u2019s expression, Zhang Han inexplicably thought that if Zi Yan had a goldfish mouth and puffed up face, he would probably squint one of his eyes and that scene would be perfect.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it tomorrow.\u201d After Zhang Han received the necklace, he looked like he was about to destroy the bridge after crossing it.\u201cNot yet.\u201d She lazily said: \u201cI want to stay on the bed tomorrow, and also want to bring Mengmeng out to play. Last time at Ocean Park Mountain, I didn\u2019t finish playing, but I don\u2019t think Mengmeng has had enough fun.\u201d\u201cHow about this, tomorrow morning we will go to Mount New Moon and I will give you the special water that I gave you last time. In the afternoon, we will bring Mengmeng to Ocean Park.\u201d Zhang Han said.\u201cSure.\u201d Speaking of \u2018water\u2019, Zi Yan became interested. She stared at Zhang Han with her big eyes and asked: \u201cWhat was the water you gave us last time?\u201dThe water that could improve one\u2019s skin was definitely extraordinary. Zi Yan had always been curious as to where Zhang Han had gotten this water from.\u201cThink of it as a specially made medicinal mineral water.\u201d Zhang Han chuckled.Pure Yang. Relatively speaking, the water was only normal water, if it was from Zhang Han\u2019s perspective when he was in the tribulation stage, then even this fifth-stage spirit treasure was a weak treasure. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have sent the thunder yang tree into the cold palace and never used it.However, who would have thought that after his rebirth, the thunder yang tree had become Zhang Han\u2019s best treasures? With Zhang Han\u2019s current strength, those first rank spirit treasure and second-stage spirit treasure were also his treasures.After all, strength determined the level of treasures. For a child, a thousand yuan was a very high amount of money, but for an adult, a thousand yuan was a very low amount of money.However, Zhang Han had already gotten used to his Qi Refining Stage\u2019s strength, the natural selection, the survival of the fittest, Zhang Han\u2019s adaptability was extremely terrifying.Returning to the main topic, when Zi Yan heard Zhang Han\u2019s explanation, he did not intend to ask any further.\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, you should go rest as well.\u201d Zhang Han said as he looked at the time.\u201cOh, it\u2019s almost two o\u2019clock.\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s expression froze for a moment, and did not expect to chat with Zhang Han on the first floor for an hour unknowingly. At this time, Zi Yan was indeed sleepy, so he stood up and glanced at Zhang Han, and asked: \u201cWhere are you sleeping today?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be on the sofa on the first floor today.\u201d Zhang Han indicated towards the sofa that Zi Yan was sitting on with his mouth pursed.\u201cThen be careful not to catch a cold, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d Zi Yan picked up the white fur clothes, looked at Zhang Han with her beautiful eyes, then put the clothes into her clothes bag and went upstairs.Zhang Han sat on the sofa, he was not sleepy either. He wanted to watch TV for a while, but he suddenly remembered that he sent a song to Xue Qian\u2019s studio\u2019s mailbox.After thinking about it, Zhang Han got up and walked to the counter of his laptop and opened up his computer, logging into his Penguin Chat software.It seemed that he hadn\u2019t used this software in more than five years.When Zhang Han sent the email, he did not log into the chat software, but instead directly sent it through the webpage.If Li Fan saw this scene, he would probably be so excited that his body would probably start to tremble, because this master had finally decided to go online!Finally, Zhang Han logged into the account that he was familiar with.When he logged in, a burst of urgent prompts sounded out.\u201cDi Di Di Di \u2026\u201dThe sound lasted for two whole minutes. Originally, Zhang Han did not have many friends, around thirty to forty people.Zhang Han tapped his mouse over, and discovered that almost everyone had talked to him before. Since he was bored, Zhang Han clicked on them one by one to read.Hong Yun immediately asked, \u201cZhang Han, what\u2019s wrong? Did something happen to you? I heard that you were cleansed and sent out of the Zhang Clan? Are you for real? \u201dFishing Network: \u201cHoly sh*t, no way? Young Master Zhang, you were kicked out of the Zhang Family? \u201cF * ck, brother, don\u2019t be sad. Why don\u2019t you come find me? I will definitely welcome you here.\u201dLu Tian Peng: \u201cWhere are you? Come have a drink from me? \u201cThe Zhang Family cannot tolerate you, so I can give you a chance to develop. With your talent, you will probably be able to rebuild in the next ten to eight years.\u201dThis Lu Tian Peng was once Zhang Han\u2019s little brother, but after seeing what happened to Zhang Han, his tone of voice no longer held the same respect as before.Dong Hu: \u201cOh, brother Zhang, were you chased out of the family? \u201cThis is really unbelievable. Brother Zhang, if you don\u2019t have a place to go, you can come to my car shop. Don\u2019t you know a lot about sports cars? You can even repair your car here.\u201dDong Hu, the previous Mount Lang Xing\u2019s racing event had caused Zhang Han to fall into a terrible situation. After seeing Zhang Han fall, he also spoke in a weird tone, only that in this life, he had fallen into the Mount Lang Xing, and his injuries were probably very severe.This was reality. There was a saying that made it so that no one asked about the poor and busy city. Wealth had distant relatives deep in the mountains, and when a person fell, the so-called friends by his side would be greatly reduced.However, although Zhang Han had a bad temper back then, and loved to stir up trouble, he had a few bad friends who cared about him. There were even two friends who would often come to see him when he was down and ask for money or pave the way, but Zhang Han had rejected them all.Finally, when the last piece of information arrived, Zhang Han discovered that there were nearly two thousand messages.This person\u2019s name is Qiao Luoluo.Zhang Han slightly narrowed his eyes, as he casually flipped through the records.\u201cZhang Han, where are you? Why did you shut down your phone? Where the hell are you? \u201d\u201cZhang Han, hurry up and answer me! Answer me quickly! \u201dZhang Family doesn\u2019t want you, I, Qiao Luoluo want you! Come with me to Xiangjiang, will you? \u201d\u201cWhat are you doing? Don\u2019t ignore me, okay? \u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dOne month later.\u201cZhang Han, I\u2019m back in the Xiangjiang, do you really not plan to look at me again?\u201d\u201cAm I really not worth loving in your eyes? \u201cWhy?\u201dHalf a year later.\u201cZhang Han, I hate you! I hate it! I was really blind to fancy you back then! \u201dOne year later.\u201cZhang Han, it\u2019s already been a year, why haven\u2019t you answered me once? I heard that you are not doing well in the Shang Jing, so come to the Xiangjiang.Two years later.\u201cZhang Han, I don\u2019t believe that you will never log on. You must have seen my chat history, I really missed you. Although I was wrong that time, don\u2019t be so heartless, okay? We agreed to be together forever! \u201dThree years later, four years later, the information was practically Qiao Luoluo\u2019s diary. She had even told Zhang Han about her having a boyfriend, and had even left a message with Zhang Han that her boyfriend was not strong at all in bed, but half a year later, after they had broken up, Qiao Luoluo and Zhang Han\u2019s words once again returned to normal. The words revealed the thought of reunion with Zhang Han, and they had always said that Zhang Han and her were the most suitable people to be together.After reading the chat log, the last record was sent over the day before yesterday.Zhang Han shook his head indifferently. This Qiao Luoluo was the girlfriend that Zhang Han had dated for a year, and their relationship was not bad.One month before they parted, Zhang Han\u2019s sworn enemy, Lin Jie, had somehow gotten mixed up with Qiao Luoluo\u2019s circle of friends. Zhang Han felt that he was trying to get close to Qiao Luoluo, so he told Qiao Luoluo about this matter and told her to stay away from him.In the end, every time Qiao Luoluo and her friends gathered together, Lin Jie would always be there. Although Qiao Luoluo intentionally kept a distance from him, the scheming Lin Jie would always talk about how extraordinary he was, how elegant his actions were, and how he could always chat with Qiao Luoluo for a while.Zhang Han had met her twice, and was a little unhappy. He had quarreled a lot with Qiao Luoluo, but on Qiao Luoluo\u2019s birthday, when he got into some trouble, Zhang Han did not attend the banquet, and Qiao Luoluo did not pick up his phone either. She was so upset that she got drunk from the alcohol, and got drunk from taking advantage of Lin Jie\u2019s absence, spending the entire night together with him.The next day, Lin Jie sent Zhang Han a series of photos. Model? Nothing much, Zhang Han, your girlfriend\u2019s taste isn\u2019t bad, this green hat is for you.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - It finally appearedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euZhang Han was so angry that he broke up with Qiao Luoluo. That night, he brought his brothers to find Lin Jie.He gave a harsh slap to Lin Jie\u2019s smiling face, and even broke one of Lin Jie\u2019s arms. At that time, Zhang Han\u2019s father, Zhang You, was suppressing, but the good news did not last long, in less than a month, Zhang Han\u2019s parents had disappeared, and his second uncle, Zhang Nan, had ascended to the throne. Not long after, many people, led by Lin Jie, began attacking, forcing Zhang Han out of the clan.If not for him being scammed by Dong Hu and him leaving the Shang Jing after being heavily injured, and if he had not jumped off a cliff later on, Zhang Han would not have entered the Cultivation World by accident, nor would he have become a famous Han Yang Immortal.After reading the message sent by Qiao Luoluo, Zhang Han smiled faintly.Right now, these people no longer had anything to do with Zhang Han, even if they were to talk about him, Zhang Han would not have any changes in heart. It\u2019s just that this Qiao Luoluo really had some perseverance, he only sent the message for more than five years and even f * cking sleeping with her boyfriend, and there was no one left but her.After watching this news, he felt like he watched movie. Life was truly like a play, it was all thanks to acting!Zhang Han directly opened the mailbox, and found another rather interesting scene.The inbox of the mailbox was the same as Qiao Luoluo\u2019s, it was filled with a long article sent by a person called Li Fan. When Zhang Han looked at the message, he could not help but shake his head, finding it funny.\u201cIs sir there? I am Xue Qian\u2019s manager, Li Fan. \u201d\u201cHello, Mr. Han Yang, may I ask if you are in? Your penguin software has been set up to refuse to add friends, so I can\u2019t add you. \u201d\u201cSir, when you have time, please give me my number. 6636XXXX, or give me a call.\u201d\u201cSir? Did you see my email? \u201cSir, please reply to me. I would like to talk to you about the actor\u2019s song.\u201d\u201cMy god, sir! It\u2019s been two days, why aren\u2019t you here yet?\u201d\u201cPlease reply, please reply, please reply. God, when are you going to come online? Hurry up and reply to me.\u201d\u201cBrother, brother, brother, blood brother, your little brother is dying of anxiety! I\u2019m about to explode from waiting!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter a long letter, Li Fan\u2019s words revealed a strong sense of resentment.Zhang Han was a little confused. He had already marked the price, what was he in such a hurry for?Thinking about it, Zhang Han did not add him or call him. Instead, he directly replied to a message: \u201cWhat happened?\u201dAfter replying, Zhang Han wanted to turn off the software, since it was after all two o\u2019clock in the morning. Even though this city had a lot of nightlife, most people had already gone to sleep.Only, what was unexpected was that when Zhang Han clicked on the closed location of the software, a message that came from the mailbox appeared in the lower right corner.\u201cMr. Han Yang, is that you? You finally appeared! \u201cGreat, please add my Penguin account number XXXXXXX.\u201dZhang Han looked at the account number, and immediately searched through the search bar, clicking to add him as a friend.Elsewhere, at Xue Qian\u2019s house.Xue Qian was not in a hurry the last two days, but gradually, after a day or two, Zhang Han still did not reply, and he also started to become anxious.A good song was hard to come by, not to mention one of the best of the best, like this one. It fit perfectly with his thoughts.Seeing that he was anxious too, Li Fan felt helpless in his heart. This master Han Yang really had a good temper.Thus, on this day, he could no longer sleep.He had been staring at his mailbox since midnight, and even if he didn\u2019t do anything, he was still visually tired. Until one in the morning when Li Fan was a little worried, and clicked on a movie that had not been released for long.\u201cOh!\u201dWhen it was almost two o\u2019clock, Li Fan yawned and muttered: \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Hanyang appeared yet? Sigh, I went to sleep after watching this movie.While talking, Li Fan grabbed the carbonated drink on the table and gulped it down.Suddenly, a message was sent from the bottom right corner of the screen. Li Fan squinted his eyes, and saw the two words\u2019 Han Yang \u2018clearly.\u201cPlop, plop, plop \u2026\u201dLi Fan glared and spat out all the drink in his mouth. On the computer, on the keyboard, on his body, on the floor.But Li Fan did not care about all these, he immediately sat up, and lost all his sleepiness.He quickly replied to an email and a few seconds later, the notification for his friend request sounded out.\u201cNice! \u201cYay!\u201dLi Fan clenched his fists and shouted, he immediately accepted the friend request and opened the chat. Li Fan excitedly typed:\u201cMr. Han Yang, is that you?\u201d\u201cOh no, I\u2019m saying that the song was written by you, Mr. Han Yang?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han replied with one word.\u201cMr. Han Yang, you\u2019re so awesome. The songs you write are pretty good.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dEh? Doesn\u2019t he like typing?Seeing such a simple answer, Li Fan was a little confused in his heart, so he typed and asked:\u201cSir, are you free right now? Can I call you and tell you more about the song? \u201dAfter a minute, Li Fan felt that the time was extremely slow, it was as if every second counted to a year. Or was it too late to disturb his rest? Is he unhappy that I took the liberty of asking for the number?As Li Fan was thinking, finally, he received a reply to the call.When Li Fan saw the number, his heart trembled. He quickly took out his phone and pressed a string of numbers.When he was about to make the call, Li Fan closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and exhaled it out.On the first floor of the dining hall, Zhang Han took a can of beer from the fridge, opened it and drank two mouthfuls before returning to his computer. After seeing the message, he sent his phone number over.Very quickly, his phone rang, and Zhang Han picked up the phone.\u201cHello, may I ask if you are Mr. Han Yang?\u201d Li Fan asked very carefully.\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great! I finally got in touch with you. Um \u2026 Han-Yang is your pseudonym? \u201cMay I know Mister\u2019s name \u2026\u201d Li Fan said excitedly.\u201cZhang Han.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Mr. Zhang. We\u2019ve seen your song. Very good. We\u2019ve decided to buy it, but regarding the price\u2026\u201d Li Fan\u2019s tone sounded a little hesitant.\u201cJust the money.\u201d Without waiting for Li Fan to finish speaking, Zhang Han interrupted him and said.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant. I\u2019m saying that what you wrote was a full copyright transfer, and the way this kind of transaction is not suitable for you. How about this, I don\u2019t know which city Mr. Zhang is from, can we go over? Why don\u2019t we have an interview? \u201cXue Qian also wants to meet you. He wants to research the song and strive to present the perfect state of the song. Would it be convenient for us to meet again, sir?\u201d Li Fan organized his thoughts and said.\u201cThat\u2019s fine too.\u201d Zhang Han thought for a while, then replied: \u201cI\u2019m in Xiangjiang, if you want to come, then come over.\u201d\u201cXiangjiang? \u201cOh my god.\u201d Li Fan suddenly exclaimed and said: \u201cThat\u2019s great, we are also at Xiangjiang. May I ask where is Sir at?\u201d\u201cNew Moon Bay.\u201d\u201cOh my god!\u201d Sir, we are at New Moon Bay right now! \u201cThis, this means that we are destined to meet each other!\u201d Li Fan said in pleasant surprise: \u201cThen mister, how about we meet with you tomorrow?\u201d\u201cNo time.\u201d\u201cNo time?\u201d Li Fan stared blankly for a bit, then subconsciously said: \u201cWe won\u2019t take up too much of Sir\u2019s time. Two hours is enough.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no time tomorrow. We\u2019ll talk about it the day after tomorrow.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cIt\u2019s fine if it\u2019s the day after tomorrow, but, then when are we supposed to pay a visit?\u201d Li Fan asked.\u201cMorning or afternoon.\u201d\u201cOh, okay, okay. Then let\u2019s go the day after tomorrow, when the time comes\u2026\u201dAs Li Fan was speaking, he suddenly heard a beep sound coming from his phone.Although he hung up the phone, Li Fan was still extremely excited. He paced back and forth in the hall, and in the end, stood by the window and smoked a cigarette.It was impossible for him to sleep that night. When people were excited and wanted to sleep, it would be very difficult.\u2026\u2026The next day, at 6.20 a.m., Mengmeng woke the slumbering Zi Yan.During this half of the night, Zi Yan was not sleeping comfortably. Normally, she would have liked to sleep alone on the bed, or hug Mengmeng, but it was a bit awkward to be in the same bed as others, even the Zhou Fei that she was very familiar with was the same.After getting up and washing up, Zi Yan carried Mengmeng to the living room on the second floor. Zhang Li and Zhou Fei also went to their own rooms to dress up.Zhang Han heard the commotion downstairs, got up and walked to the second floor, only to see Zi Yan combing Mengmeng\u2019s hair and preparing to braid her hair.\u201cI woke up early. How was your sleep last night?\u201d Zhang Han walked over and sat beside Mengmeng, and casually asked after looking at her for a moment.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. It\u2019s just that the time is a bit short.\u201d Zi Yan replied.\u201cPaPa, I was the one who woke mom up.\u201d Mengmeng said as he blinked her big eyes.\u201cMengmeng woke up so early. You can even wake mother up. You\u2019re really amazing.\u201d Zhang Han said with a light smile.\u201cCluck, cluck, cluck \u2026Mama still wants to sleep late, hmm hmph, the sun will shine on your ass. \u201d Mengmeng waved her little arm.\u201cAlright, alright, alright. You\u2019re the best, alright?\u201d Zi Yan smiled and rolled her eyes at Mengmeng. When she was tidying her hair, she suddenly changed her expression, without even turning her head, she said: \u201cOh yes, Mengmeng\u2019s hairstyle was also very beautiful yesterday, did you tie it up?\u201dShe subconsciously felt that it was impossible for a burly man like Zhang Han to have such a fine and beautiful hairstyle.Just as Zhang Han was about to answer, Mengmeng the little princess took the initiative to reply:\u201cHumph, it\u2019s that little sister combed the cute Mickey Mouse for me.\u201d\u201cOh, sister, who is it?\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s hand slightly paused, her expression was normal, and she asked without emotion.\u201cThat\u2019s right, she is always here, always looking for PaPa, and she even went to the Mount New Moon twice. Yeah, one of them even said that to the PaPa, that she loved you to death.\u201d Mengmeng replied seriously while pondering.Liked it?

    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 - Big sister?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euI was unhappy when I heard about it. Hmph, only Mom would be able to love PaPa, other people would not be able to.\u201d Mengmeng added.Hearing that, Zi Yan stared at Zhang Han for a few moments, and revealed a faint smile with a sense of danger, and said:\u201cSeems like our Boss Zhang has a pretty good appetite. He has been in the Xiangjiang for only a few days, and there\u2019s already someone who loves him.\u201dAlthough she said this, in Zi Yan\u2019s heart, she could not help but snort coldly.\u201cHow many days has he been in Xiangjiang for?\u201d\u2018Is there a little big sister here? \u2018\u2018If Mengmeng isn\u2019t here, who knows what might happen? \u2018\u201cPlayboy is playboy, hmph, dogs can\u2019t change eating sh * t, you bastard!\u201dVery inexplicably, Zi Yan was a little angry in her heart, but at the same time, she was also a little aggrieved.She hadn\u2019t even considered about finding the other half of the relationship, and she had even thought of developing a relationship with Zhang Han. But who knew that this bastard would have such a good relationship with others within a few days of her going out to work! He was simply too much of a bastard!\u201cMengmeng was talking about a member of the restaurant. She would come over to eat every day and occasionally make a joke when she\u2019s familiar with me.\u201d Zhang Han replied with a chuckle.\u201cOh.\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s expression did not change, and said indifferently: \u201cShe has already bought a membership, and you\u2019ve only known each other for a few days and she made such a joke. It seems Young Master Zhang\u2019s charm has not diminished since then.\u201dHer tone was the same as usual, but why did her words carry a hint of vinegar?\u201cEh \u2026\u201dZhang Han smiled as he shook his head: \u201cI\u2019m going downstairs to prepare breakfast.\u201dWith that, Zhang Han got up and went downstairs.\u201cHumph!\u201d Zi Yan looked at Zhang Han\u2019s back and snorted, expressing her dissatisfaction.\u201cAhhh!\u201d Mengmeng learnt it as if it was not a big deal.Zi Yan\u2019s attention returned to Mengmeng\u2019s hair. As she tied her braid, she asked: \u201cIs that little sister pretty?\u201d\u201cBeautiful.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Zi Yan curled her lips slightly, and subconsciously asked: \u201cWhat about she Compared with Mom?\u201d\u201cHmm, of course Mama is beautiful. Mama would be the most beautiful.\u201d Mengmeng waved her arm and gave the truth.Zi Yan opened her mouth, just as she was about to say something, Zhou Fei and Zhang Li walked out of the door at the same time.\u201cAiyo, why did I hear someone praising Mom\u2019s beauty so early in the morning?\u201d Zhou Fei smiled and looked at Mengmeng.\u201cDon\u2019t talk too much.\u201d Zi Yan rolled her eyes at Zhou Fei and tied up Mengmeng\u2019s hair with a leather sheath. A beautiful ponytail was born.\u201cElder Sister Yan, are there any activities today? Do you want to go out to play or go straight back to the Yunyin Garden? \u201d Zhou Fei sat beside Zi Yan and said.At this time, Zhang Li curiously sat at the side. She still hadn\u2019t found out what kind of situation her brother and Zi Yan were in yet.From yesterday\u2019s interactions with her, she felt that Zi Yan was rather courteous to her brother, but it seemed that husband and wife wouldn\u2019t do that. Furthermore, the actions of the two were like that of a friend.Normally, once two people had a child, they would spend a lot of time in bed. Pregnancy was not such a simple thing; not only did they have to have a pre-pregnancy check-up, they also had to have a romance in bed at the right time.Under this kind of situation, Zi Yan treated her brother like this again.Could it be \u2026 My brother cheated?Zhang Li\u2019s heart beat, she felt that she had guessed the true meaning of the matter.If Zhang Han knew what his sister was thinking, he would definitely not know whether to laugh or cry.He and Zi Yan, were really an accident. One shot, one bullet, was something they did not expect.At this time, facing Zhou Fei\u2019s question, Zi Yan muttered to herself for a moment before saying, \u201cThis morning, Mengmeng and I will go to Mount New Moon with him. In the afternoon, Mengmeng, how about we go to Sea Park in the afternoon?\u201dWhile speaking, the corner of Zi Yan\u2019s mouth rose into a smile, and her eyes looked forward to Mengmeng\u2019s happy expression.\u201cEh?\u201dHearing that, Mengmeng was startled at first, then her eyes lit up, and she exclaimed: \u201cReally? We\u2019re going to Sea Park? \u201cWow, that\u2019s great, let\u2019s go to Ocean Park to play, let\u2019s go to Ocean Park to play \u2026\u201dThe little princess was so happy that she was dancing in joy. Her cute appearance caused Zi Yan, Zhou Fei and Zhang Li to laugh uncontrollably.For children, being happy was as simple as this. Going out to play with their family made them very happy.However, when a child grew up, his focus would always be on his friends. He liked to go out with his friends, so he was free and unrestrained, gradually spending less and less time with his parents. However, when he truly opened his eyes, he realized that his parents were always the first to treat him sincerely.But such a thing wouldn\u2019t happen to Zhang Han. After all, Zhang Han wasn\u2019t an ordinary person, there were too many places he could take Mengmeng to play in. A world\u2019s exploration would be extremely exciting, like a world where one could play for a year and ten thousand worlds, then set a small goal and play with him for ten thousand years.Back to the main topic, it was about seven o\u2019clock. The customers were gathering at the restaurant from all directions as usual.The members continued to walk over to the members\u2019 table under the envious gazes of the crowd.\u201cGood morning boss, where\u2019s Mengmeng?\u201d Liang Mengqi and the other two greeted as they entered.\u201cUpstairs.\u201d Zhang Han replied as he prepared to cook Egg-Fried Rice.\u201cOh.\u201d Liang Mengqi replied with a laugh.After a night of tossing and turning, Liang Mengqi also came to a realization that it was not wrong that she liked Zhang Han, but if Zhang Han had a family, then she would definitely not interfere, and would not make any moves. Even if she liked him, there were still principles behind her actions.And if she really did become a mistress, then based on her status, her father\u2019s family would be known for tens of thousands of years.Their Liang Clan was a super big family, with a large population and a large number of leaves. Her family was divided into many factions, and there were even some that were hostile towards each other.After she was seated at the outer member\u2019s table, Zhao Feng walked in a few minutes later. Seeing that Zhang Han was busy, he did not greet him and directly sat opposite of him.\u201cYou look annoying.\u201d Liang Mengqi rolled her eyes.\u201cCough, cough.\u201d The corner of Zhao Feng\u2019s mouth twitched a few times. He glanced at Zhao Dahu and Yu Qingqing who were holding in their laughter, then looked at Liang Mengqi with a bit of helplessness: \u201cMengqi, why are you not too friendly to me? I don\u2019t seem to have done anything outrageous here!\u201dAfter holding it in for a few days, Zhao Feng finally asked the question that was in his heart. He was very curious as to why Liang Mengqi was always looking at him with hostility.\u201cNo reason, hmph.\u201d Liang Mengqi snorted, her large eyes glaring at Zhao Feng, her mouth twitching, she said: \u201cHow can a mere commoner get the attention of the young lady?\u201d\u201cEn\u2026 Fine.\u201d Zhao Feng shook his head with a stiff expression.Seeing his expression, Liang Mengqi couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing.After these few days of contact, of course she didn\u2019t dislike Zhao Feng too much, but had said that she liked to tease Zhao Feng a little instead. Every time she saw him speechless, she would feel that it was really fun.Then, Liang Mengqi and Yu Qingqing started chatting, while Zhao Feng quietly listened from the side.The three of them had nothing to do at the moment, so Zhao Dahu planned to rest for two or three months to look for a job. After all, he had the qualifications and connections, so applying for a job was easy, but to reach the position of Deputy Director, he would need to make a name for himself in the new company.After chatting for a while, Sun Ming walked in with Sun Dongheng, Sun\u2019s mother and the other two. Sun Ming was holding an ornamental bag in his hand and inside it was a small, fluffy white bear doll.He, Sun\u2019s mother and a few others sat together at the neighboring member tables. On the other hand, Sun Ming walked to the counter in the kitchen and waved the bag in his hands, saying: \u201cBoss, the food you made is really delicious, seeing you and Mengmeng, also allowed me to think things through. Thank you, this is a small gift for Mengmeng, I hope you like it.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Zhang Han glanced at it, nodded indifferently, and said: \u201cJust put it on the sofa, there\u2019s no need to be so polite.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Sun Ming smiled and nodded.\u201cWow, is that a gift? Mengmeng has a present again? \u201d Just then, Zhang Li walked down the stairs with Mengmeng. Mengmeng saw the little white bear in the bag in Sun Ming\u2019s hands with a single glance, and immediately ran over.\u201cHey, hey, hey, slow down. Don\u2019t fall down.\u201d Zhang Li hurriedly said from behind as he walked a few steps forward to carefully guard Mengmeng.Behind her, Zhou Fei yawned and walked down. It was obvious that this girl had not woken up yet.Zi Yan was the last to leave. When she woke up in the morning, she had only dressed up a little, but even if she dressed up simply, her simple appearance had already crushed everything else.A pure, natural beauty was Zi Yan.But just as Zi Yan came out, she saw that the house was almost full of people, and then she saw that more than twenty people were lined up outside the house, waiting, her eyes slowly opened wide:\u201cAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\u201dZi Yan exclaimed, she turned and fled.She never thought that Zhang Han\u2019s restaurant would have so many customers.Running up the stairs, Zi Yan sat on the sofa and patted her chest. She took a deep breath and laughed:\u201cThat\u2019s true, the food that that that guy cooked is so delicious. There must be a lot of customers.\u201dIf there were too many people, Zi Yan would not be able to eat on the first floor, thus she took out her phone and leaned on the sofa to play with it.Downstairs.Mengmeng ran and hopped until she was in front of Sun Ming, a little embarrassed as she looked at him.\u201cUgh \u2026It\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s a gift for me! \u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Sun Ming smiled benevolently and said: \u201cThis is a small gift for Mengmeng.\u201dAs he spoke, Sun Ming handed over the bag in his hand.Mengmeng reached out to grab the white bear, and hugged it tightly with her two small arms. She looked at Sun Ming happily, and said: \u201cUn ha, thank you Big Uncle, what a beautiful little bear, Mengmeng likes it.\u201dLiked it?

    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 - PaPa, he wants to give me a kiss.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euMengmeng hugged the little bear, jumping around happily.Her cute little appearance caught the attention of the people in the dining room.Sun\u2019s mother, Sun Dongheng shook his head and laughed. Liang Mengqi and the others also laughed softly.It was just that Liang Mengqi looked at Zhang Li and her gaze was filled with suspicions.\u2018Amongst the two of them, one of them is Mengmeng\u2019s mother? She doesn\u2019t look that good either.\u201dLiang Mengqi had mixed feelings in her heart.She thought that Mengmeng\u2019s mother would be extremely beautiful, but now it seems that she was about the same as her. Even though they were both beautiful girls, there was an inevitable drop in their hearts, and at the same time, they felt a lot more relaxed.If she saw that Mengmeng\u2019s mother was really much prettier than her, then Liang Mengqi would probably be jealous and lose hope again.Seeing that Mengmeng really liked presents, Sun Ming also smiled quite happily and said:\u201cIt\u2019s good that you like it, next time Uncle will bring a present for Mengmeng.\u201d\u201cMm, alright, thank you uncle.\u201d Mengmeng replied happily.In the Little Princess\u2019s heart, it seemed that since she had interacted with the PaPa, there had been more and more people who had sent her a present.Mengmeng climbed onto the sofa with the white bear in her arms and happily played with the little white bear doll in her hands. Even when Zhang Li and Zhou Fei, who were beside her, wanted to take a look, Mengmeng refused to let them.Liang Mengqi sat on the table, her eyes staring at the other side. After hesitating for a moment, she finally could not hold back the curiosity in his heart, got up and walked over.She stood at the back of the sofa and adjusted her expression, maintaining her state of mind. She looked at Mengmeng and smiled: \u201cGood morning, Mengmeng.\u201d\u201cHmm, good morning, little sister.\u201d Mengmeng turned to look at Liang Mengqi, stretching out a small arm and waving it downwards.Liang Mengqi\u2019s words attracted both Zhang Li and Zhou Fei\u2019s attention. After Liang Mengqi greeted them, she looked at the two of them, scanned them a few times, and laughed and asked: \u201cI wonder who Mengmeng\u2019s mother is?\u201dThe two of them shook their heads after saying this.Zhang Li sized Liang Mengqi up a few times, then smiled and said: \u201cI am Zhang Han\u2019s little sister, my name is Zhang Li.\u201d\u201cI am Mengmeng\u2019s aunt.\u201d Zhou Fei gave a simple introduction.At this time, Liang Mengqi\u2019s gaze slightly froze, and she subconsciously said: \u201cOh, hello, my name is Liang Mengqi, I\u2019m the first member of the restaurant.\u201dLiang Mengqi said, and then looked around: \u201cYesterday I heard from Mengmeng that her mother was coming, why is she not here? I have always been curious about what kind of beauty could give birth to such a cute and beautiful little princess like Mengmeng. \u201dLiang Mengqi\u2019s eyes shone with fighting spirit, as if she wanted to compete with Mengmeng\u2019s mother to see who was prettier.\u201cEh?\u201dOnly then did Mengmeng remember that Zi Yan was not by her side, and she spoke in her childish voice: \u201cI was Mama \u2018upstairs, why did I not come down? Un, hmph, little big sis, just you wait, I will go and tell me to come down.\u201dAfter Mengmeng finished speaking, she carried the little white bear and ran up to the second floor.Zhou Fei thought for a moment, then followed her. When she reached the second floor, she just happened to see Mengmeng acting coquettishly in Zi Yan\u2019s embrace.\u201cElder Sister Yan, there are so many people down there. There are more than ten in the restaurant and there are even twenty to thirty outside. Business is booming! According to the price of the food, this restaurant is selling food for more than a million RMB per month. Zhou Fei said in surprise.In Zhou Fei\u2019s opinion, opening a business for three hours a day with the turnover entering into a million, could simply be called a miracle.\u201cYeah, there are quite a few people.\u201d Zi Yan shook her head slightly, looked at Mengmeng, extended a finger and scratched her nose, and said: \u201cMengmeng, I won\u2019t go down now. You can go down to play, and come up to accompany Mama when it\u2019s time to eat.\u201d\u201cUgh \u2026\u201d \u201cOh, but, but little sister looks at Mama.\u201d Mengmeng pouted.The little princess knew that Mama was very beautiful, and she was the kind of \u2018able to take it out\u2019. Every time she heard someone praise Mama, she would be very happy, and she also felt that if Mama went down, she would definitely be shocked.\u201cWhat little sis.\u201d Zhou Fei smiled lightly, and said: \u201cMengmeng, you should also call her Little Aunt. She\u2019s not much younger than us, and she\u2019s pretty pretty.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Zi Yan muttered to herself.\u201cHmm, Mama is the most beautiful, no one is as beautiful as Mama.\u201d Mengmeng raised her small hand and said with a serious face.\u201cPuchi \u2026\u201d Zhou Fei could not help but laugh, and said: \u201cWhat Mengmeng said is right, your mother, is beautiful.\u201d\u201cHmm hah, of course.\u201d Mengmeng chuckled.Zi Yan thought about it, but in the end, she didn\u2019t go downstairs. Although she really wanted to see that so called \u201clittle sister\u201d, even though she wanted to let that little big sister who said \u201cI love you so much\u201d to see what Mengmeng\u2019s mother\u2019s face looked like, after thinking about it, she still gave up.Mengmeng and Zhou Fei stayed upstairs for a few minutes, then returned to the first floor.\u201cElder sister, uh, I won\u2019t let her down. Oh, she\u2019s here, she\u2019s in a hurry.\u201d Mengmeng whined.Liang Mengqi heard and nodded, then laughed: \u201cThen next time when there\u2019s a chance, let\u2019s do it again.\u201dAfter she finished speaking, she nodded towards Zhou Fei, then turned back and gracefully returned to her seat.Seeing this, Zhang Han did not care at all. He did not know that this was a battle between women, even if he knew, Zhang Han would not care about such trivial matters.The fragrant rice had already been prepared, and Zhang Han was about to start today\u2019s Egg-Fried Rice.Just as he was about to do it, another wave of guests arrived.Wang Qiang brought Wu Liying and walked in. This time, Wang Qiang was holding onto a four or five-year-old little boy.The boy\u2019s hair was short and his eyes were very black and very bright. He was slightly thin and had a very delicate appearance.When the three of them walked in, the people lining up at the entrance looked over in confusion.Wang Qiang and the other two calmly walked to the furthest member\u2019s table and sat down.\u201cAnother three members? F * * k me! Rich people! \u201dThe people standing in line outside immediately began discussing.\u201cAiya, how many members are there? Let me check. Four, three, three. Oh my god, the top ten membership cards have all been sold? \u201d\u201cI wonder if that child counts.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go check the notice board.\u201d One of the good ones got up and ran over. After he saw the words, he glared at them and ran back, shouting on the way: \u201cIt\u2019s true, it\u2019s true! The top ten membership cards have all been sold. The next members will each get 10 million!\u201d\u201cI say, isn\u2019t this speed a bit too fast? \u201cThere are so many rich people, no, there are so many rich people eating in this restaurant, casually spending one million to buy a member. Sigh, if there were any robbers, then there\u2019s no need to rob the bank and the members here are taken away, that\u2019s good!\u201d\u201cStop dreaming, what era is this? A bandit?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNot only the people outside the restaurant were also surprised.\u201cThere\u2019s a new member.\u201d Liang Mengqi whispered.\u201cThat\u2019s right, the members are selling it too quickly.\u201d Zhao Dahu sighed lightly and said: \u201cAiyaya, I worked so hard for five years and only managed to save three million. But boss, you\u2019ve only opened the restaurant for two days and you\u2019ve already sold ten million of your membership cards.\u201d\u201cGet lost!\u201d Yu Qingqing stared at Zhao Dahu, and said: \u201cCan you not make me feel disgusted?Zhao Dahu shook his body, and did not say anything else.On the other hand, the little friend who was following Wang Qiang, suddenly saw Mengmeng playing on the sofa after entering the room, causing him to be unable to sit still, but he did not stand up. He only looked with anticipation, wishing that he could go and play with Mengmeng.Finally, under his gaze, two minutes later, Mengmeng also noticed a little friend coming into the dining hall.\u201cEh?\u201dMengmeng was startled for a moment, then put down the little white bear in her hand, jumped off the sofa, and ran over, standing in front of the little boy, and carefully sized him up.\u201cWah, wh-what\u2019s your name?\u201d Mengmeng asked as blinking her large, clear eyes.\u201cMy name is Li Zhiwen, what about you?\u201d The little boy replied timidly.Her expression looked very bashful, just like the Mengmeng she had first met with.\u201cI\u2019m called, Zhang Yu Meng, hmph, PaPa, Mama and the rest all call me Mengmeng.\u201d Mengmeng pouted.\u201cThen can I also call you Mengmeng?\u201d The little boy whispered.\u201cOh, sure.\u201d Mengmeng answered straightforwardly.\u201cHehehe.\u201d The little boy laughed happily. He got down from the chair and stood in front of Mengmeng, looking a little shy. With a slightly flushed face, he said: \u201cMengmeng, you\u2019re so beautiful.\u201cIs that so? \u201cCluck, cluck, cluck \u2026\u201d Mengmeng said happily: \u201cThen you, you also look good.\u201dThe interaction between the two children became the focus of the audience.The friendship of a child comes so quickly. As one grows older, the number of friends becomes fewer and fewer, because as one grows older, people tend to hide their inner thoughts more and more.To him, Mengmeng was more beautiful than all of the little girls in his own district. Un, she was more than ten times more beautiful than all of the little girls.The little boy was a little bashful. He clasped his hands together, looked at Mengmeng, and said with a very low voice. \u201cMengmeng, you\u2019re so pretty, me \u2026 I want to give you a kiss. \u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Mengmeng was startled, but did not know how to reply. Thus, her gaze turned towards Zhang Han who was raising a pot of fried Egg-Fried Rice in the kitchen, and she shouted out, \u201cPaPa, PaPa, oh, he, he wants to kiss me.\u201dClank, clank, clank, clank \u2026The item in Zhang Han\u2019s hand directly dropped onto the stove as his eyes slowly widened and his heart jumped.After returning from his past life, his heart, which had always been calm, finally felt like it was his first time to ride a roller coaster.\u201cNo way!\u201dZhang Han screamed, he did not even care about the frying pan anymore, he did not even take off his apron anymore, directly walking out with big strides. Picking up Mengmeng, he looked at the little boy vigilantly, then rushed to the second floor.\u201cZhao Feng, help me take out the Egg-Fried Rice. You can eat now.\u201d Zhang Han left a message and went upstairs.Everyone on the first floor looked at each other, dumbfounded.Liked it?

    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 - Home feelingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euZhao Feng quickly got up and went into the kitchen to turn off the fire on the stove.As for the little boy, he stood by the dining table, not knowing what to do.\u201cThat\u2026 Gramps. \u201dWhile Liang Mengqi was on the way to eating, when she passed by Wang Qiang\u2019s side, she hesitated for a moment and said: \u201cBoss is really concerned about his daughter, normally he wouldn\u2019t even let us hug her, let alone kiss her, you \u2026 I think it\u2019s better to talk to your little child. \u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wang Qiang nodded, and with a slight frown, he carried his grandson back to his seat. Looking at the little guy, he said: \u201cGrandson, you\u2019re already four years old, boys and girls can\u2019t be intimate, there\u2019s a difference between males and females, you know?\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d He thought for a while and felt that he was right, so he retorted in a small voice: \u201cBut mother told me that she really likes me, so we kissed. I also really like Mengmeng, so I wanted to kiss her.\u201dTo him, this was the first time he had seen such a beautiful little girl. He wanted to kiss her cheeks to express his happiness, but it seemed that Mengmeng\u2019s father\u2019s reaction was too big.Hearing that, Wu Liying smiled gently, patted his grandson\u2019s head, and stood up to serve them food.As for Wang Qiang, a trace of helplessness flashed across his face as he said: \u201cEven if you like it, you can\u2019t kiss it. It\u2019s impolite. Remember that in the future, you can kiss your own family members, other people might not like having you kiss them.\u201d\u201cI know, Grandfather.\u201d The little boy pouted.He felt a bit unhappy because he did not dare to express his bashful personality. However, when the little fellow had his first taste of Egg-Fried Rice, that feeling of unhappiness completely disappeared and was replaced by happiness.At this moment, in the living room upstairs.Zi Yan\u2019s body lazily leaned against the sofa as she browsed through her Weibo in boredom. Back then, when she had become extremely popular, there were about ten million followers on Weibo, and each post contained tens of thousands of messages and hundreds of thousands of likes.But after that, Zi Yan left the Entertainment Circle and this group of fans exploded, Zi Yan did not explain anything, ultimately leading to a chorus of sighs. There were many people unfollowing her, and up to now, there were only 5 million people still follow her, and two years ago, Zi Yan had tried to post two messages, showing that the number of comments and likes were few in number.Zi Yan looked at the messages she had posted before, and was sighing with emotion, when she suddenly saw Zhang Han carrying Mengmeng and walking over with large strides.As he neared, Zhang Han placed Mengmeng beside Zi Yan.Mengmeng\u2019s expression also became timid. She clearly understood that there was a trace of pity in her big eyes.\u201cPaPa, are you angry? PaPa, don\u2019t be angry \u2026 \u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d \u201cCome, Mama.\u201d Zi Yan looked at Zhang Han strangely and hurriedly pulled the little princess into her embrace.As for Zhang Han, he was still a little fearful. He let out a deep breath, looked at Mengmeng and chuckled softly. He reached out and stroked Mengmeng\u2019s little head, and said:\u201cDaddy isn\u2019t angry.\u201d\u201cRally?\u201d Mengmeng\u2019s eyes regained luster.\u201cReally, Dad isn\u2019t angry.\u201d Zhang Han slightly shook his head and coughed lightly. Under Zi Yan\u2019s curious gaze, he sincerely and sincerely said to Mengmeng: \u201cMengmeng, didn\u2019t Father tell you before, that apart from Father and Mother, no one can kiss you.\u201d\u201cUgh \u2026\u201d But, but PaPa is saying that Mengmeng cannot kiss others \u2026 \u201d Mengmeng remembered the words of the PaPa very clearly.\u201cOthers can\u2019t even kiss Mengmeng!\u201d Zhang Han said very seriously: \u201cMengmeng, aside from my parents, you cannot be kissed by others, nor can you be kissed by others. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cI understand, Mengmeng doesn\u2019t allow others to kiss me, then, then what others want to kiss me?\u201d\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s eyes flashed with seriousness, and he said: \u201cSlap him!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dZi Yan glared at Zhang Han after she heard him, and she knew what was going on with their conversation. Thus, Zi Yan turned to Mengmeng and smiled: \u201cMengmeng, don\u2019t listen to your PaPa\u2019s nonsense, if anyone wants to kiss you, you can reject them, don\u2019t listen to your PaPa\u2019s words, beating them up is wrong, and you are a girl, you need to be gentle and quiet.\u201d\u201cHmm, Mengmeng is quiet.\u201d Mengmeng raised her small arm and said.Zhang Han stood at the side, thought for a while, and said with some unease: \u201cThen, according to your mother\u2019s suggestion, you will refuse first.\u201cZhang Han!\u201d Zi Yan looked over with killing intent.Teach her daughter to beat someone up, what kind of father was that? Now was the time for Mengmeng to have such a personality. Education was of the utmost importance, and for some unknown reason, Zi Yan felt a little uneasy about letting Mengmeng stay here.\u201cI\u2019ll go get the rice.\u201d Zhang Han glanced at Zi Yan, then turned and walked downstairs.If you lost the argument with woman, you wouldn\u2019t be forgived. If the argument went well, you would say that you were narrow-minded and petty, and couldn\u2019t care less about it. Especially if she was Mengmeng\u2019s mother, which really made Zhang Han feel helpless.If you want Mengmeng to stay, you have to pass the test of Zi Yan.After a while, Zhang Han served 3 cups of milk and 3 servings of Egg-Fried Rice.\u201cIs this the Egg Fried Rice you usually sell?\u201d Zi Yan placed the plate on the tea table in front of him and smelled the fragrance first. The smell was so fragrant that made her stomach flutter.\u201cIt\u2019s time to eat, the food cooked by PaPa is the most delicious.\u201d Mengmeng mumbled as she pouted. She picked up the spoon and started to eat the Egg-Fried Rice.Zhang Han looked at the two women whose actions were very similar and felt that this moment was very warm.\u2018Is this the feeling of home? \u2018Zhang Han\u2019s gaze became a little blurry. After his rebirth, he had been living a lonely five hundred years of cultivation. If it wasn\u2019t for Mengmeng, then Zhang Han\u2019s current state of mind would probably be very cold.One should not doubt that a powerhouse in the heavenly tribulation would appear to be a normal person. He would definitely have the demeanor of a monarch descending upon the world, treating life like grass, and everything else like dogs.Needless to say, what Zhang Han did right away was to find ways to raise his strength. Then, he would take revenge, kill him who was like a river of blood, kill him who turned the world upside down, and let the world know that an ant was an ant, and that in this world, he was the king!However, Mengmeng\u2019s existence was like a rising sun slowly rising from a dark world, brightening up Zhang Han\u2019s mind. Adding to the fact that his parents had disappeared, and he wasn\u2019t in any trouble, it completely settled the hostility in his heart and all kinds of negative emotions.It also allowed him to become like this, a person with a plain pursuit and a peaceful personality.This was the first time he had experienced such a feeling; perhaps this was the change in his state of mind as a father.Standing at thirty, not knowing his place at all, and knowing his destiny at fifty, these were also very reasonable words. They spoke of the changes that had occurred in one\u2019s state of mind.To Zhang Han, this was also a kind of concept. In his life, he still had a lot of things he hadn\u2019t experienced yet.Zhang Han shook his head with a faint smile. He stopped thinking about it and sat beside Mengmeng and started to eat his breakfast.At the same time, at Xue Qian\u2019s house.\u201cWhat?\u201dXue Qian just got out of bed, his eyes were hazy and confused, but when he heard Li Fan shouting in front of him, Xue Qian\u2019s eyes slowly widened, he was completely awake, at the same time, an excited expression filled his eyes: \u201cHave we connected?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d \u201cHahaha, I got in touch.\u201d With dark circles under his eyes, Li Fan laughed loudly, \u201cI finally managed to get in touch with him last night, it\u2019s really f * cking great. Old Xue, guess where he is right now?\u201d\u201cWhere? How would I know?\u201d Xue Qian shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s in Xiangjiang! Hahaha, what a coincidence, he\u2019s right here in New Moon Bay! \u201cOh my god, such a coincidence actually exists in this world. There must be a heaven\u2019s will somewhere!\u201d Li Fan said as he danced in joy.\u201cWhat did you say? That we\u2019re going to meet? \u201d Xue Qian hurriedly asked.\u201cYes.\u201d Li Fan shook his head, and said: \u201cHe said that he has no time today, and will go in the morning or afternoon tomorrow to discuss matters, and tell me the location.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great, then let\u2019s have a good rest today and go visit him tomorrow.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dZhang Han\u2019s dining hall.Liang Mengqi and the other two wanted to sit for a while more, but especially Liang Mengqi, she wanted to see who the landlady of the restaurant was. However, because they had an appointment with a friend, they left after sitting for a while.After everyone left, Zhang Li was preparing to clean up the dining hall.Although the customers were all clean, whether it was the floor or the dining tables, they were all stained. Although Zhang Li was a miss in the past, it was different now.Just that, when she had just gotten up, Zhao Feng had already taken the cloth and started wiping the tables one by one.\u201cOh, Zhang Li, looks like your brother has other waiters.\u201d Zhou Fei looked at Zhao Feng strangely, then lowered his head and continued looking at his phone.Zhang Li was also a little curious, she brought a cloth and walked in front of Zhao Feng, and asked curiously: \u201cI saw you sitting at this member\u2019s seat eating, you\u2019re also a member of the restaurant right? Why are you here cleaning up? \u201d\u201cI did it of my own free will. Because the boss is very good and has cooked very well, I almost became a little fool of his . I usually don\u2019t have much to do, so I cleaned up a bit before I left.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled at Zhang Li.\u201cYou\u2019re quite warm-hearted.\u201d Zhang Li laughed and said.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Zhao Feng shook his head slightly.It was only in this Mengmeng\u2019s casual restaurant that Zhao Feng would be so passionate. It was only when Zhan Han was the boss that Zhao Feng would become like a little brother, and even when he was facing Tang Zhan, he would sometimes say no!Furthermore, if the people from the underground powers were to find out that Zhao Feng was said to be enthusiastic, they would definitely laugh their teeth off and claim that he was blind. But, it did happen.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 - So it turned out that the boss had a great background!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOh yeah, are you the boss\u2019s sister?\u201d Zhao Feng wiped away the table and turned to look at Zhang Li with a smile.\u201cMy brother\u2019s surname is Zhang, and mine is also Zhang. What do you think?\u201d Zhang Li replied.\u201cWhere is your hometown?\u201d Zhao Feng had always been curious about Zhang Han, and had never asked him about it on several occasions. It was because he felt that the boss rarely chatted with people, and might not even pay attention to him, and this beauty in front of him was Zhang Han\u2019s younger sister. She could tell a lot of news about Zhang Han, so Zhao Feng asked.\u201cShang Jing.\u201d Zhang Li replied simply.\u201cShang Jing? \u201cThe capital of China, the most complicated place in the mainland.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled slightly and said: \u201cThen the boss must be mighty in Shang Jing, right?\u201dHearing that, Zhang Li sized Zhao Feng up from head to toe and did not reply.Although she did not say it, one of them said something. Only that Zhou Fei, who was sitting at the table, laughed without raising her head, and snorted: \u201cHeh, not only is he powerful, let me tell you this. My brother-in-law was previously one of the great young masters of the Shang Jing. He was the eldest young master of the Zhang Family, his identity is not just for show. I also heard that my brother-in-law was extremely arrogant in the past, and was almost unstoppable in the Shang Jing, although he is considered to be the lowest ranked of the Four Young Masters, the other three young masters did not dare to provoke him because he would truly beaten up!\u201dZhou Fei said all of these in one go and all the information she received was from Zi Yan\u2019s friends.That person had said that Zhang Han had been an extreme powerful person in the past, and he had also mentioned his miserable life after his downfall. It was just that she now treated Zhang Han like an idol and did not choose to talk about the period of Zhang Han\u2019s downfall.After Zhang Li heard this, she rolled her eyes.As for Zhao Feng, he shook his head and laughed. Mengmeng\u2019s aunt in front of him, , had directly called him a little brother, but she was not that old yet. Zhao Feng, on the other hand, did not have any other thoughts as he was already used it that people treating him like an ordinary person in this restaurant.However, Zhou Fei\u2019s last few words made Zhao Feng suddenly understand and say:\u201cSo the boss is one of the Four Young Masters of Shang Jing. But with the boss\u2019s power, no one would dare to provoke him.\u201dWhat a joke, with the boss\u2019s skill, even he, who was in the top three of the special forces fighting strength, had been defeated in one move.But Zhang Li\u2019s next sentence, instead, gave Zhao Feng goosebumps.\u201cMy brother isn\u2019t that great either.\u201d Zhang Li pursed her lips and laughed, then said: \u201cBack then, my brother fought with Shang Jing\u2019s number one young master, Liu Tiannan, and in the end, he was injured. After that, my brother even brought five bodyguards with him.\u201d\u201cPuff \u2026\u201d \u201cCough, cough, cough \u2026\u201d Zhao Feng almost failed to catch his breath and coughed a few times. After calming himself down, Zhao Feng muttered with a somewhat weak voice, \u201cCrouching tigers and hidden dragons, Shang Jing is a city that owns undiscovered talents\u2026\u201dZhang Han\u2019s impressiveness already made Zhao Feng feel like he was a primary school student in front of him. However, right now, he was hearing about someone even stronger than the boss, how could this not shock Zhao Feng?The current Zhang Han was a monster who had cultivated for five hundred years. Although it was just the Qi Refining Stage, it was not something that ordinary people could compare with.These words also caused Zhao Feng to misunderstand profoundly. Just by thinking about it, he felt that it was terrifying: even stronger than the boss, wouldn\u2019t that mean he had to go to heaven?After hearing this news, Zhao Feng did not want to ask any further.As they chatted, Zhang Han carried the Little Princess and walked down. Behind him was the elegant Zi Yan.Because she was going to the Mount New Moon, Zi Yan combed her hair and tied up her hair with a braid.Zhao Feng was stunned when he saw Zi Yan.He slightly frowned. He felt that Zi Yan was extremely familiar as if he could easily say her name. But because he was so muddleheaded right now, he couldn\u2019t say it out. This feeling was somewhat uncomfortable.Suddenly, Zhao Feng\u2019s mind lit up, he turned and looked at the two photos of Zi Yan that were newly changed on the wall, his eyes slowly opened wide, and shouted:\u201cZi Yan? This\u2026 is the landlady Zi Yan? \u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so surprising about that?\u201d Zhang Li glanced at Zhao Feng and said.\u201cYes, yes, yes.\u201d Zhao Feng reacted and shook his head with a wry smile.Why did his mind become so weak after meeting Zhang Han? Where did Zhao Feng who was able to maintain his calm despite being pressured by Tai Shan in the past?So he put down the cloth in his hand, walked to the front, smiled at Zhang Han then looked at Zi Yan and said: \u201cHello landlord, I never thought that Miss Zi Yan was the landlord here.\u201d\u201cHello.\u201d Zi Yan gently nodded her head.\u201cHmm hmph, Mengmeng already said that my mom is very beautiful\u201d. Mengmeng said while pouting in Zhang Han\u2019s embrace.\u201cHahaha \u2026\u201d Zhao Feng laughed and said: \u201cThat\u2019s right, what Mengmeng said was the truth. Your mother is super beautiful, and Mengmeng is also super beautiful.\u201d\u201cHehehe, Mengmeng is also super pretty, just like Mama.\u201d Mengmeng smiled happily.After greeting, Zhang Han carried Mengmeng and walked out. Zi Yan followed behind like a little wife, in her hand was a bag containing the remote control aircraft that Mengmeng had prepared, as well as a few items that Zi Yan had developed, such as a parasol, a hat, cloth, etc.There was an old saying: There can\u2019t be a woman in the house!Zhang Han had never thought about things like hats and umbrellas. Although the temperature and humidity in Mount New Moon were the most comfortable, it would still affect the whiteness of one\u2019s skin exposed to sunlight for too long.\u201cOh, boss, the fish seedlings and other things will be here soon. Should I go and bring them directly to the Mount New Moon later?\u201d Zhao Feng saw that Zhang Han was about to leave the dining hall, so he quickly said this.\u201cAlright.\u201dZhang Han only left a one-word reply, then pushed the door and went. Besides the panda car, Zi Yan carried Mengmeng in her arms.Zhang Li and Zhou Fei looked at each other, finding curiosity in each other\u2019s eyes towards the Mount New Moon.They wanted to go as well, but they felt that there were some electric light bulbs. After discussing for a while in the morning, they decided to give up on the electric light bulbs.\u201cWhen are you going to the Mount New Moon?\u201d Zhang Li looked at Zhao Feng and asked.\u201cAbout an hour later.\u201d\u201cThen we\u2019ll go together.\u201d Zhou Fei said with a smile.\u201cBut \u2026\u201d Zhang Li suddenly hesitated and said: \u201cWe are all going, who is looking at the dining hall?\u201d\u201cThis \u2026\u201d Zhou Fei was slightly stunned; she did not expect this question.\u201cI\u2019ll call someone over to look at the restaurant later.\u201d Zhao Feng shook his head and laughed, efficiently resolving the problem.Not long after, Zhang Li\u2019s Maserati GT was driven over by the technical master. After getting the keys and procedures ready, the car belonged to Zhang Li, and half an hour later, two of Zhao Feng\u2019s subordinates arrived at the dining hall.These two people were the subordinates of Zhao Feng\u2019s faction. Although the leader of Yonghe Society was Tang Zhan, the few generals under Tang Zhan all had their faction, and each of them had their loyal subordinates.Zhao Feng had the least number of subordinates, but the people inside were all relatively average, just a little wild.\u201cBrother Feng, we\u2019re here!\u201dThe two casually greeted each other after entering the room.Seeing this, Zhang Li and Zhou Fei looked at Zhao Feng strangely. Zhou Fei only felt that Zhao Feng was not an ordinary person, but Zhang Li had rather high standards. Looking at this scene, Zhou Fei already had a faint feeling that he had some connections with the underground powers.However, the two of them did not say anything. Zhang Li drove the new Maserati to bring Zhou Fei to the carriage to pick up the fish seedlings. Afterward, they headed to Mount New Moon.On the other side.When Zhang Han drove the car to the foot of Mount New Moon, he parked the car, and the family of three walked up the mountain.Just then, Zi Yan and Mengmeng held hands and led the way, while the bag went straight to Zhang Han\u2019s hands, he casually followed behind.\u201cHmm, Little Black, where are you? Mengmeng is here to play with you.\u201dPassing through the forest, Mengmeng could not wait any longer and called out.A soft voice resounded within the territory.\u201cAo, ao, ao \u2026\u201d From the back of the mountain came a small, cheerful cry of Little Black.The moment the cry fell, one could see Little Black running over quickly from underneath the thunder yang tree at the top of the mountain. Its speed was extremely fast, and the fur that matched black and gold fluttered in the wind, giving it an imposing air.\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d Mengmeng also happily ran over, taking small steps.Little Black arrived very quickly, and when Mengmeng saw that they were very close, she was a little too anxious. She didn\u2019t manage to hit Little Black with her little foot and tripped over it, but in the end\u2026Splash.Mengmeng fell forward onto the ground. Because it was all grass, even if she landed on the ground, it would not hurt.\u201cEh?\u201d Mengmeng felt the grass beneath her and stretched out her soft and tender little palm. She dubiously patted the grass, and saw Little Black running towards her with her clear and large eyes, and said in a baby voice, \u201cThat\u2019s not right, it\u2019s not, ugh, it\u2019s not Little Black\u2019s stomach.\u201dAfter Mengmeng finished speaking, she crawled up. At this time, Little Black was already in front of her, so Mengmeng pounced forward with her mouth pouting.\u201cAwoo \u2026\u201dLittle Black\u2019s body hastily flipped, its stomach moving upwards, and steadily caught Mengmeng.Mengmeng was satisfied with this, she smilingly patted its stomach, stood up, and ran to the top of the mountain with Little Black.Seeing Mengmeng\u2019s appearance, Zi Yan smiled and shook her head, then looked around at her surroundings. Her gaze was filled with amazement: \u201cThe scenery here is great, I didn\u2019t even see clearly last night.\u201dZhang Han stood beside Zi Yan, looked around, and said softly: \u201cThis place will be even more beautiful in the future.\u201dLiked it?

    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 -Imagining the futurePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euZi Yan was slightly startled.Will it be even more beautiful in the future? What do you mean? It means that in the future, not only will this place be beautiful, my relationship with Mengmeng and him will also get better and better? Is he ready to woo me?Sometimes, Zi Yan\u2019s brain was still quite big. When facing Zhang Han, she couldn\u2019t keep the calmness in her heart, and would always let her imagination run wild because of his words.Thinking about that, Zi Yan\u2019s gaze suddenly landed on that small ocean of flowers.\u201cHuh?\u201d Zi Yan let out a light cry, and walked over with large strides.As she neared, the fragrance in the air turned into the fragrance of flowers, causing Zi Yan to unconsciously take a few deep breaths. As she got closer and closer, Zi Yan\u2019s eyes became larger and larger, and by the time she got near, her mouth had already opened slightly in shock.Fortunately, she quickly reacted and used her right hand to cover her red lips. Her beautiful eyes glanced at Zhang Han, and could see the deep shock in her eyes.\u201cOh my god, Zhang Han, are these all real flowers?\u201d Zi Yan asked in shock.\u201cCould it be fake flowers?\u201d Zhang Han didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry as he replied.\u201cIs this an orchid? So beautiful! The colors are so bright, and there are even different colors. \u201d Zi Yan said as she looked at the small patch of orchid in front of her.\u201cYes, these are the varieties of orchids.\u201d\u201cWhat is this flower?\u201d Zi Yan pointed to a flower on her right and asked.The flower had six petals that were like willow leaves, slender and beautiful. The petals intersected with each other and were extremely beautiful.\u201cThis is Hyacinth.\u201d\u201cWhat flower is this? So beautiful. \u201d Zi Yan walked a few steps forward, and asked when she saw another type of flower.The flowers in this area were white and yellow, with five petals that looked like a net inside an electric fan.\u201cThis is an egg flower.\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cThis is \u2026\u201dZhang Han explained the situation to Zi Yan as if he were a flower master.\u201cWow, what beautiful roses.\u201dWhen Zi Yan saw the rose at the front, her eyes lit up and she quickly walked over.As the symbol of love and romance, roses were deeply loved by women. Zi Yan was no exception.\u201cThere are so many colors, red roses, white roses, blue roses, purple roses, pink roses, champagne roses, and black roses? \u201cSo many. So beautiful.\u201d Zi Yan said in pleasant surprise.Zhang Han smiled when he saw her expression.Originally, there was only one type of red rose on the Mount New Moon, but when the territory was being remodelled, Zhang Han intentionally copied some of the roses and adjusted their color. To the thunder yang tree, adjusting the color of the roses was naturally an easy task.\u201cSo beautiful, I\u2019m afraid even the Juliet Rose of England is just like this. These are the most beautiful rose I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Zi Yan shook her head and lamented. Her palm gently reached out, wanting to stroke the flower petals, but she was reluctant to do so. She only touched it once in a while, then put her head closer, closed her eyes, and took a deep breath in front of the flower petals.At this moment, the flowers were beautiful, and Zi Yan was even more beautiful.\u201cJuliet Rose?\u201dZhang Han was startled for a moment, and then he recalled Juliet Rose\u2019s information.Juliet roses had a total of fifteen years of flower life, fifteen years of flower life, and were extremely rare and precious. They were worth three million pounds. Zhang Han had read about Juliet roses before, so he knew their shape.After hearing about it, Zhang Han felt that it was possible for him when he changed his territory at that time. After all, those flowers were of the highest quality, but \u2026Zhang Han smiled as he shook his head: \u201cThe roses in Mount New Moon are better than the roses in Juliet.\u201dThe Mount New Moon\u2019s roses were already the best in the world, but in terms of shape, Juliet, who had more petals, had its unique beauty. After all, the thirty million prices wasn\u2019t paid in vain.\u201cThe roses are beautiful.\u201d Zi Yan bit her lips as her beautiful eyes swept Zheng Han. Her long eyelashes lightly trembled as she faintly said: \u201cIf it were a gift for a girl, it would definitely be pleasing to the eye.\u201dThere was always a trace of bitterness in her words. With such a good rose, why wouldn\u2019t he give it to her?Could it be that he didn\u2019t take her seriously? Or did he intend to give it to her at the right \u2026Just as this thought rose in her mind, Zhang Han was splashed with cold water in front of her. He laughed lightly and said: \u201cNo one wanted to take it as a gift, so one didn\u2019t pay attention to these flowers.\u201dZi Yan\u2019s expression froze as she stared at Zhang Han, stunned.Zhang Han was baffled and a little scared at the same time, but he faintly felt that there was something wrong with the words just now.Just as Zi Yan wanted to say something, Mengmeng who was already under the thunder yang tree suddenly waved her small arm and shouted.\u201cAh! Papa, Mama, quickly come over, you guys are really slow. Mengmeng has been waiting for a long time!\u201dIn response to Mengmeng\u2019s call, Zi Yan snorted lightly and turned to walk towards Mengmeng.Zhang Han shook his head and laughed as he followed along.Walking under the thunder yang tree, Zi Yan also saw the scene at the back of the mountain and could not help but exclaim:\u201cZhang Han, you have raised so many animals and pets? There is quite a lot of crop growing. \u201d\u201cUgh \u2026\u201d This was all given to Mengmeng by Papa. \u201d The little princess pouted and said.Mengmeng was a small child, but she knew that Zhang Han had specially made these things for her. She also knew that if were not for Mengmeng, there wouldn\u2019t be such a beautiful place.After Zi Yan heard this, she laughed as she rubbed Mengmeng\u2019s little head. At the same time, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a little jealous.That guy did so many things for Mengmeng, but didn\u2019t even do anything to her, or even planned to give her such beautiful flowers. What did he mean by this? Is her that unimportant in his eyes?Thinking about it, Zi Yan couldn\u2019t help but find it funny; she never thought that one day she would also be jealous of her own daughter.But that guy was too boring. It was all his fault!At this time, he laughed heartily and said: \u201cThis place has only just started to take shape, look at the crops at the back, there\u2019s an orchard. When the fruit trees are planted a little, the fish pond there will have some fish seedlings placed today, and in front of this tree, this piece of land will be used to build a few villas in the future \u2026\u201dThe moment he said that shocked Zi Yan. She was a little surprised; her beautiful eyes sparkled as she looked at Zhang Han. \u201cFrom what you said, I\u2019m looking forward to what happens here, but I\u2019m not sure if you can get it out. It sounds like a huge project, and this is the official land. You\u2019ve only been renting here for a year, and the construction has been going on for over a year.\u201dWhile talking, a trace of doubt appeared in Zi Yan\u2019s eyes. In this place where every inch of land was worth money if Zhang Han wanted to achieve his goals. How much money would he have to spend? Furthermore, the authorities might not even bid for this land. If he was not granted the right to exploit it, how could he build it?Zi Yan thought, but what she did not know was that after the first round of modifications in the Mount New Moon, it had changed a lot. If the people from the New Moon Bay\u2019s Bureau of Civil Affairs came over to check, they would definitely be shocked!Under normal circumstances, people from the Bureau of Lands would come over to investigate around three months, but Zhang Han had let the Head Wang Qishan down, as he had always\u2019 remembered \u2018to take care of the Mount New Moon.However, Zhang Han did not care about him at all, using force to block the water; there was nothing that could not be solved.At this moment, Zhang Han was facing Zi Yan\u2019s words with a slight smile and his voice revealed his confidence, \u201cThe things that I have said, can be done in at most three years, and I might even be able to do them a little earlier.\u201dWithin five years, the thunder yang tree could have those three changes to the territory, and during the second transformation, all of the projects that Zhang Han had mentioned could be completed. One must know, the second transformation was many times more energy than the first one, it was not as simple as adding one to two, but after the third transformation, the Mount New Moon would become a true treasure trove!\u201cIs that so?\u201d Zi Yan curled her lips, her beautiful eyes sparkling as she looked at Zhang Han, and said: \u201cThen I\u2019ll be waiting for you to fulfill what you have said.\u201dThese words made Zi Yan feel as if she was waiting for him, as if she was looking forward to seeing him. She didn\u2019t know why, but when she talked to Zhang Han, she was always very casual, and after some consideration, it caused her to feel that she was doing something to him.Zi Yan\u2019s eyes flickered as she looked at him. In her heart, she also felt that the longer she spent in contact with Zhang Han, the more casual she seemed to be. Could this be the feeling of home?\u201cPaPa Mama, come and play!\u201dMengmeng and Xiao Hei ran to the area where the pets were. Seeing the arrival of the little master, this group of sons of bitches immediately became lively. Even the aloof and cold pine lion and the Husky who had already let go were circling Mengmeng.During this time, they also learned of a truth:If you want to be a good man, you have to flatter the little master. Don\u2019t you see how \u2018big brother\u2019 does all this?It was just that \u2018big brother\u2019 did not have a good attitude towards them. Hmm, he would always grit his teeth and just casually throw his comrades out to play as a ball when he had nothing to do with them. It was truly full of malice.But \u2018Big Brother\u2019 was really different from his young master. Looking at his slovenly appearance, he seemed like a eunuch praising the emperor. Damn it! The chance to sneak away was taken away by him!As a result, all the little dogs also became smarter. When they saw Mengmeng coming over, they became all well-behaved, which made Mengmeng a little flustered.\u201cZhang Han, there are a lot of germs on dogs. Do you usually let Mengmeng play with them like this?\u201d Zi Yan raised her eyebrows, as she spoke with a questioning tone.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Zhang Han casually replied: \u201cThey don\u2019t have those bacteria on them, so don\u2019t worry about them. Also, I\u2019m giving them some of the water you guys drank today, so there\u2019s no need to worry.\u201dLiked it?

Last time, when Zhang Han said this, she did not say anything because Little Black did indeed look different from the masses. But to have thirty or so of them in one go, this seemed to be a little too much.\u201cWhy would I lie to you?\u201d Zhang Han didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, and looked at Zi Yan: \u201cI didn\u2019t lie to you, if you\u2019re really worried, take some dog fur to test it out, okay?\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d Zi Yan rolled her eyes at Zhang Han, and said: \u201cYou\u2019re so good at deceiving people, who knows if your words are true or not.\u201dWith that, Zi Yan ran back to Mengmeng with a brisk pace, and two girls and the dogs started running and jumping around, playing with each other.Zhang Han accompanied them at the side. At this moment, his heart felt warm watching them play on the lawn.\u201cZhang Han, give me the bag.\u201d After playing for a while, Zi Yan turned her head to look at Zhang Han as she reached out her hand and said.Zhang Han handed the bag over, and Zi Yan took out a round cushion that had a diameter of two meters from the bag, placed it on the grass, and waved hand towards Mengmeng: \u201cMengmeng, come sit down and rest for a while.\u201d\u201cHmm Hah, Mengmeng is not tired.\u201d Mengmeng\u2019s face was covered in sweat. The little princess was busy riding Little Black to battle on the battlefield, she did not even turn her head to look at Zi Yan as she replied him.\u201cNo, Mengmeng, come over here quickly, you\u2019re already sweating, I\u2019ll help you wipe your sweat first.\u201d Zi Yan said again.Mengmeng was still very obedient, after hearing that, she patted Little Black\u2019s body and said in a baby voice: \u201cWu, let\u2019s go, Little Black, to join Mama.\u201d\u201cAwoooo \u2026\u201dBecause Little Black was afraid that Mengmeng would fall off her body, it carefully turned its body and slowly walked toward Zi Yan.\u201cPuff \u2026\u201d Seeing that, Zi Yan could not help but laugh, she looked at Zhang Han and said: Where did you get such a magical dog? \u201cSo amazing, it understands human nature.\u201d\u201cUn humph, Little Black is that\u2026 Earth Gold Emperor Dog. \u201d Mengmeng snorted, she thought for a long time, but still could not find out Little Black\u2019s full name.Seeing that, Zhang Han laughed, and said: \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you last time, it is an iron-clad Golden Emperor Dog; its name is Little Black.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. It\u2019s an iron bag, an emperor dog. Little Black is really amazing.\u201d Mengmeng rode Little Black to the front, Little Black slowly laid her body on the ground. Mengmeng slid down from the side and happily ran to Zi Yan.\u201cMengmeng, sit down and rest for a while.\u201d Zi Yan patted the mat beneath her.Mengmeng walked over, sat down on her butt, and imitated Zi Yan\u2019s actions, patting the mat a few times, and said: \u201cPaPa, sit down and rest for a while.\u201dSeeing that, Zhang Han laughed and shook his head, then sat on the right side of Mengmeng.\u201cLook at how you\u2019re playing, you\u2019re already acting like a little crazy girl.\u201d Zi Yan took out a tissue paper and wiped the perspiration off Mengmeng\u2019s forehead, then took out two hats.One was Zi Yan\u2019s usual pink cap, and the other was adorable looking pink cap.\u201cCome, Mengmeng, put on your hat, this way you won\u2019t get sunburned.\u201d Zi Yan then handed the hat over.\u201cUn humph, no, ma, just put on the hat and Mengmeng\u2019s hair will be messed up.\u201dThe Little Princess still liked to be smug, so she blinked her clear and large eyes as she said seriously. She seemed to have forgotten that Zhang Han didn\u2019t usually tidy up her hair.\u201cA ponytail and a hat are not messy. Look, Mama takes off the hat, it\u2019s not messy, is it? \u201cBe good and put on your hat.\u201d Zi Yan personally demonstrated it, and when Mengmeng saw that Mama\u2019s hair was not messed up, she took the hat and put it on.Not everyone would be able to wear a hat, there were some who couldn\u2019t look good wearing it, but for a head of moderate size like Mengmeng and Zi Yan, it could be said that they could handle more than 90% of hats.\u201cMama, is it nice for Mengmeng to wear this hat?\u201d Mengmeng asked with a face full of anticipation.\u201cGood, very good.\u201d Zi Yan said with a smile.\u201cPaPa, is the hat nice?\u201d Mengmeng chuckled as she looked at Zhang Han.\u201cOf course, Mengmeng is the world\u2019s most beautiful little princess, even when she wears a hat.\u201d Zhang Han replied with a smile.\u201cHmm hah, the Mama is super beautiful, the PaPa is also super handsome, and Mengmeng is also super beautiful.\u201dMengmeng blinked her large eyes. Her left hand grabbed onto Zi Yan\u2019s right palm, while her right hand grabbed onto Zhang Han\u2019s left palm.As if Zi Yan knew what was going to happen in the next moment, her heart inexplicably tightened, but she allowed Mengmeng to hold her hand.Mengmeng\u2019s two small hands grew closer and closer. Gradually, four palms came together, and the moment Zi Yan\u2019s beautiful palm and Zhang Han\u2019s palm came into contact, Zi Yan felt like she was struck by lightning. Not only was she nervous, even her palm felt a little numb.\u201cEn, PaPa, hold onto Mama\u2019s hand!\u201d Seeing that their hands were not holding onto anything, Mengmeng asked anxiously.Zhang Han laughed softly and grasped Zi Yan\u2019s white and tender hands in his own.At this time, Zi Yan\u2019s body felt a bit numb, it was a kind of nervousness, a kind of unfamiliar feeling, also a kind of complicated feeling.As for Mengmeng, the best assistant, she happily looked at the two big palms, her small arms wrapped around their arms, and said in a blissful tone: \u201cPaPa and Mama are accompanying Mengmeng, Mengmeng is so happy \u2026.\u201dAs she spoke, Mengmeng put her head on the palm of the two of them. The little guy had always been looking forward to this scene, PaPa, Mama and Mengmeng, being together would be the happiest thing.Zi Yan\u2019s heart trembled. When she looked at Zhang Han, she realized that Zhang Han was also looking at her.At this moment, as the two of them looked at each other, the world seemed to have come to a standstill.She saw a hint of warmth and a hint of expectation and shyness in his eyes.After they had looked at each other for ten seconds, Zi Yan quickly lowered her head. Her long eyelashes trembled slightly, revealing that she was not calm at all.There was something special in Zhang Han\u2019s heart as well. Looking at the blissful Mengmeng, his heart started to soften:\u2018Actually\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s good to continue like this.\u201dZhang Han murmured in his heart. This was the first time such a thought truly occurred to him.The two of them held hands for around two minutes. Mengmeng was waving her little arms and humming a song. Zi Yan lowered her head in silence. Zhang Han looked at the two of them with a gentle gaze.Until Zhang Han felt the sweat on his palms and knew if she was hot or nervous, thus he let go of Zi Yan\u2019s hand. He smiled and rubbed Mengmeng\u2019s head, saying: \u201cMengmeng, Daddy is going to do something, you and Mommy are going to play here.\u201d\u201cUgh \u2026\u201d hmm hmph, alright. Be quick, PaPa. \u201dMengmeng felt that her best support wouldn\u2019t hold hands for long, so she replied as she looked at Zhang Han with her big eyes and waved her small palm.\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhang Han laughed heartily.After getting up, he first set up a large parasol for them, and then he walked towards the thunder yang tree at the peak of the mountain in large strides.\u201cHu \u2026\u201dAfter Zhang Han left, Zi Yan took a deep breath, feeling that her heartbeat was still speeding up.\u2018Just holding hands is all, Zi Yan, you\u2019re so shameless\u2026 \u2018\u2018What\u2019s wrong with me \u2026? \u2018\u2018Why did it feel like lightning to hold hands with him? Back then, both he and I\u2026 \u2018If not, Mengmeng would not have appeared. It was just that at that time, the two of them were in a daze and had subconsciously completed everything together. The feelings they had at that time were still unclear, so she and Zhang Han still had a strange feeling.As everyone knew, it was unforgettable when a couple held hands, hugged, kissed and \u2026 for the first timeIt was an unforgettable experience, and the psychological and physical reactions were even more intense. For example, when the palm touched the body, it would give off a feeling of numbness. People usually called this infatutation period.Even though the two of them had Mengmeng, they were not truly lovers. Some reactions were normal.And as for Zhang Han, of course there wasn\u2019t any reaction. At this moment, he walked to the bottom of the thunder yang tree, and looked at Zi Yan and Mengmeng who were seated far away in the pet area. He then looked at his own palm, slightly shook his head.Somewhat regretfully, Zi Yan\u2019s white and tender hands were very soft and comfortable.\u201cLet\u2019s get down to business.\u201dZhang Han laughed and shook his head. He then took out the necklace from his pocket.\u201cIn the future \u2026\u201d After Zhang Han glanced at the necklace, he turned to Zi Yan and softly murmured, \u201cI will give you \u2026 the best necklace in all the heavens! \u201dZhang Han and Zi Yan both held the mindset of freely developing, whether the two would succeed in the future was still unknown, but in Zhang Han\u2019s eyes, it was something that was almost natural for the two of them to succeed. Unknowingly, Zhang Han had already accepted Zi Yan, and seeing Zi Yan\u2019s attitude, she also started to accept Zhang Han.This was more or less what Zi Yan and Zhang Han had in mind.Zhang Han retracted his gaze, and used some strength in his hand that was holding the necklace, causing the necklace\u2019s chain to break and fall onto the ground. Zhang Han\u2019s hand that was holding the heart-shaped stone suddenly opened up and with a bang, he pressed it onto the thunder yang tree.\u201cObsidian crystal!\u201dZhang Han squinted his eyes. The spirit energy in his body was constantly gathering in his palms, pulling the energy from the obsidian crystal.\u201cBuzz!\u201dAn extremely faint muffled sound was emitted and an invisible ripple surrounded the thunder yang tree. Then, it was absorbed by the thunder yang tree.Strands of the obsidian crystal\u2019s energy flowed to the thunder yang tree. Five minutes later, the obsidian crystal\u2019s energy completely disappeared, and the heart-shaped stone let out a crisp sound, transforming into powder that floated along with the light breeze.And all the energy that came from the obsidian crystal was overflowing with the thunder yang tree.\u201cRefine!\u201dAbruptly, Zhang Han\u2019s gaze concentrated as the spirit energy pulled the crystal energy. It continuously gathered on the Jade-fire dew and began to refine it.The Jade-fire dew with impurities intersected with white and green. Under the invasion of the energy crystal, the green impurities gradually became lighter, lighter, and finally dissipated, leaving behind the milky white Jade-fire dew without impurities. This Jade-fire dew already belonged to the second-stage spirit treasure!Refining the Jade-fire dew cost two-thirds of the crystal\u2019s energy, and the remaining third was temporarily stored in the thunder yang tree.Liked it?

    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - Fish seedlingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euIn the underground lake, there were only three liters of Pure Yang energy left. Water, under Zhang Han\u2019s willpower, the thunder yang tree controlled all of the pure yang water. The water was sucked into the tree trunk from the tree root and the energy from the crystal was absorbed by the thunder yang tree.A moment later, in the cave pool, pure yang water flowed out from the strands of thunder yang tree.One liter, two liters, three liters.In just five seconds, the amount of Pure Yang water reached three liters, similar to when it had just absorbed. However, pure Yang water was still flowing through the roots.Four liters, five liters \u2026 ten liters \u2026 twenty liters \u2026It was only when the water reached thirty liters that it stopped completely.Thirty liters!The amount of Pure Yang water finally increased a bit.\u201cI can finally do a little more.\u201dZhang Han smiled and shook his head, placing his hand on the thunder yang tree and guiding it to absorb the ten liters of pure yang water, disintegrating it into a wave of energy, and spreading it out along the thunder yang tree\u2019s roots, nourishing the soil and water in the territory.At this time, the energy of an obsidian crystal would also come to an end.Just as Zhang Han retracted his palm, Little Black who was strolling in the pet area suddenly perked its ears and immediately followed with a grin.\u201cWoof, woof, woof!\u201d Little Black called out twice in the direction of the front mountain, indicating that someone was coming up.The person who came over at this time was most likely Zhao Feng and the others who had come to send them fish seedlings.Zhang Han\u2019s gaze looked down towards the forest. Twenty seconds later, Zhao Feng\u2019s figure appeared on the lawn of the territory first, following behind him were Zhang Li and Zhou Fei, followed by eight or nine people who came to deliver the fish seedlings one after another.\u201cAwoo!\u201dThe chance to act cool had come! Little Black scuttled over with a \u2018woosh\u2019 sound.\u201cSigh, what a beautiful place!\u201d\u201cDamn! It\u2019s so beautiful! It\u2019s simply a paradise on earth!\u201d\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen such a beautiful place.\u201d\u201cPhew, the air, the fresh air, it feels great!\u201dEveryone was sighing with emotion. This was the first time that people had come, and they were all changing into the appearance of Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden.\u201cYa, such a big dog?\u201dWhen Zhang Li saw Little Black coming, she was shocked and exclaimed in shock.After Zhou Fei saw this, her face became even more nervous, her body sticking closely to Zi Yan, while the others became even more nervous.If it were a pet dog with golden fur, they wouldn\u2019t be afraid, but seeing such a big and ferocious looking dog, they felt a chill run down their spines.\u201cIt\u2019s okay; it doesn\u2019t bite!\u201dZhao Feng waved his hand and said to everyone.As he spoke, Little Black also ran up to him. Just as he finished speaking, Little Black lit up its fangs at Zhao Feng, and gave a low growl, as if its father was going to do something to him.This scene caused everyone\u2019s hearts to tighten, and also caused Zhao Feng\u2019s expression to freeze. Just as he said that he was fine, Little Black was just acting arrogantly, and had slapped him in the face!\u201cIt, does it really not bite?\u201d Zhang Li asked somewhat nervously.\u201cThis \u2026\u201d Zhao Feng did not know how to answer. Bite? Not bite? That also depended on the situation, with Zhang Han here, it could be sure that it would not bite anyone, but at the moment, Zhao Feng did not know either, especially that fellow, who had the expression of wanting to bite him alone!\u201cAooo \u2026\u201d Little Black continued to roar, and moved closer to Zhao Feng step by step, looking at the tiger-like sharp teeth in its mouth, it really made people\u2019s hearts shiver.\u201cAlright, Little Black, come back.\u201d Zhang Han said from far away under the thunder yang tree.His voice was not loud, and was so loud that Zhao Feng and the rest could not hear him clearly, but Little Black\u2019s hearing was much stronger than before, so it could clearly hear Zhang Han\u2019s shouts.Thus, Little Black growled at Zhao Feng and the rest with its final growl, turned its head and ran towards Zhang Han.\u201cPhew \u2026\u201dSeeing this scene, everyone couldn\u2019t help but let out a sigh of relief.\u201cBrother Feng, what kind of dog is this? It feels so fierce, just like a tiger! \u201d one of Zhao Feng\u2019s lackeys asked with lingering fear in his heart.Zhang Li, Zhou Fei and the rest were all looking at Zhao Feng.Under the gazes of several people, the corners of Zhao Feng\u2019s mouth twitched, and in the end, he said weakly: \u201cThis dog, even if a tiger comes, it might not be its match. So among the people that came today, without me leading, you absolutely should not come up without yourself, because if the boss is not here, this dog will bite you to death.\u201cHuh?\u201dZhao Feng would never make such a joke. If he said that this dog could bite a person to death, then it definitely had the strength to do so!\u201cIs this dog that powerful?\u201d Zhang Li asked with some curiosity.\u201cOf course, even if I wanted to deal with it, I would have to expend some effort.\u201d Zhao Feng laughed bitterly and shook his head.According to Zhang Han, he was not a match for Little Black with his bare hands, but he was still a man, and would subconsciously take out a weapon no matter what. Zhao Feng was no exception, if he were given a blade, defeating Little Black would only be a matter of time.\u201cLet\u2019s go up.\u201d Zhao Feng took the lead and walked towards the top of the mountain.The others followed closely behind, and couldn\u2019t help but exclaim:This grass is so soft, look at backwards, after you step on it you stand up again; it\u2019s so magical, and that tree in front, why is it so big, so tall, ah, like a big mushroom, no, it\u2019s like the world tree in a magic game, so cool \u2026As Grandma Liu entered the large garden; naturally, she had to let out a sigh of relief everywhere. As for Zhang Li and Zhou Fei, the two girls, their gazes also drifted towards the sea of flowers.\u201cAhhhh, Zhang Li, Zhang Li, look over there! F * ck, is that for real?\u201d\u201cHmm? Wow! What beautiful flowers! Quickly go and take a look! \u201dThe two of them quickly ran over. They were much wilder than Zi Yan, and their shouts would occasionally come from there:\u201cDamn, it\u2019s a real flower!\u201d\u201cSo beautiful. Oh my god, this is simply the most perfect thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe two of them shook their heads and exclaimed in admiration, looking at Little Red Heart, and even Zhang Han and the others did not notice that they were already walking towards the back of the mountain.Arriving at the back of the mountain, Zhao Feng saw the mother and daughter sitting in the pet area, and was startled. He squinted his eyes, because he was too far away to see Zi Yan\u2019s appearance, but he could see that the lady was an absolute beauty.Therefore, Zhao Feng could not help but be curious in his heart. He looked at Zhang Han and asked: \u201cBoss, the one sitting over there is \u2026 our landlady?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han nodded.\u201cIt looks a bit familiar.\u201d Zhao Feng asked doubtfully.Zhang Han shook his head and did not say anything else. Seeing that, Zhao Feng suppressed his curiosity and did not ask further.When the group of people arrived at the pond, the surroundings of the pond was separated by hollies. Every few meters, there would be a few hollies that were around half a meter tall, like a doorstep.The professional who was called by Zhao Feng lifted his leg and wanted to walk over, intending to get some water from the pond to try.He had also heard from Zhao Feng that this water could breed salted water fish and freshwater fish at the same time, so he naturally did not believe it.Just as his leg was about to step over, Zhang Han opened his mouth:\u201cWait, the water is more than four meters deep.\u201dThis pond was like a swimming pool to Zhang Han; he did not want the beach or the lake to become deeper and deeper.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe professional was slightly surprised, but he quickly retracted his leg. After thinking for a while, he called the person beside him and pulled his right hand. At the same time, his left hand held an empty water bottle and filled the pond with an empty bottle of water.He looked at the sun for a few seconds, then asked his men to get a microscope and put some water on his glasses.He then poured some water into his palm, licked it a few times, and personally tasted the quality of the water.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe man\u2019s eyes widened slightly as he looked at the water in the bottle with surprise. He hesitated for a moment before putting the bottle in his mouth and gulping down the water.He wanted to taste it again, but he couldn\u2019t stop after the first sip.\u201cGurgle gurgle gurgle\u2026\u201dEven the people around him looked at him blankly.What are you doing?How did he get drunk just like that?Under the gaze of the crowd, the professional finished drinking all the water in the bottle in one gulp.\u201cAh \u2026\u201d He shook his head as he thought about it, \u201cAwesome!\u201d It had been a long time since he drank such delicious water! \u201cThis is great! Come on, Hold me. I\u2019ll have another bottle.\u201dAt this point, he completely forgot about his work and tasks, only to take a few sips of water here.With the help of his companions, he took another bottle and gulped it down.\u201cHahaha, this is great!\u201d It\u2019s really delicious, much better than the deep well water in my hometown. This water is too awesome! \u201dHe gave the crowd a feeling as if he had drunk some kind of hundred-year-old wine.\u201cIt\u2019s really delicious? Let me have a taste too. \u201d His companion asked curiously.\u201cThen wait a moment. I can still drink half a bottle!\u201d \u201cCome, hold me.\u201d Professionals also want to drink half a bottle.Little did he know, that at this time, Zhao Feng already had an awkward expression on his face. He felt as if a few black lines were floating on his forehead, and when he saw that the professional he found was drinking water, he couldn\u2019t help but remind him:\u201cCough cough, \u2026 can you start working? \u201dZhao Feng opened his mouth, and the professional with glasses moved; he looked at Zhao Feng and retracted his body, then looked at Zhang Han with an embarrassed expression: \u201cSorry, boss, the water here is too delicious, I couldn\u2019t hold it back \u2026.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. If you want to drink it, then drink it.\u201d Zhang Han casually waved his hand.\u201cHehe, alright, thank you, boss.\u201d The professional laughed and refilled another bottle of water.He drank half of the bottle and felt his stomach swell. Then he gave the bottle to his companions. After they tasted the water, they all rushed to eat until they were full.The professional walked in front of Zhang Han and changed his tone to a serious working tone, and said:\u201cThis is great, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to raise saltwater fish. So I decided on my own, and all I got were freshwater fish seedlings because the water in the boss\u2019 pond is just over an acre wide, they could not raised.\u201dLiked it?

If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll need you to feed me some fish food at regular intervals.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve prepared some fish food at the bottom of the lake.\u201d Zhang Han nodded his head, with regards to food, there was meat and grass, there was no need for Zhang Han to worry.\u201cThat won\u2019t do!\u201d The professional\u2019s expression changed slightly as he said:Feeding fish is something to be learned; it cannot be too much. After a fish is satiated, it will speed up its breathing and increase its oxygen demand to help it digest; if the body is hypoxic, then the fish that is satiated will definitely die; and if you feed the fish, you have to choose carefully, some inferior fodder can\u2019t be fed too much, and some inferior fodder will expand when it encounters water. When it entering into the stomach of the fish, it eats too much will cause the organs of the fish to burst.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han replied indifferently.The rules that the bespectacled man spoke of were all reasonable, but this was the Mount New Moon, not something that could be judged by common sense.Water hypoxia? Don\u2019t mean it; this is the spirit water.Chould it died with enough food? Sorry, the fish ate the meat and grass. That would never happen.Nothing could be concerned. Zhao Feng could see through Zhang Han\u2019s intention, so he looked at the man with glasses and said: \u201cAlright, let\u2019s begin.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d The professional nodded and said to his companions, \u201cCome on. Get to work. Let\u2019s bathe the fish seedlings!\u201dAfter the fish entered the pond, it seemed to sense something and happily swam around in the pond. From time to time, it would jump out of the water, causing ripples to form on the surface of the water, filling the pond with life.After placing the fish and shrimp seedlings into the pond, Zhao Feng waved and let them leave.They begged to take a photo here. When they saw Zhang Han nodding his head in agreement, they were overjoyed. They took several pictures together and even wanted to take a picture at every corner, but a few minutes later, Little Black came over and lit its fangs at them, and they obediently went down the mountain.After they finished with the fish pond, Zhang Li and Zhou Fei slowly walked over from the mountain.\u201cBrother!\u201dZhang Li ran over and said excitedly: \u201cBrother, those flowers in front are too beautiful! How do you raise it? \u201d\u201cYeah, yeah! Brother-in-law, you\u2019re too awesome! I really have a lot of things to kowtow to you! I didn\u2019t expect brother-in-law to be able to create such a paradise! Heavens, this place is too beautiful!\u201d Zhou Fei\u2019s eyes widened, as she spoke with exaggerated expression.\u201cIf you like those flowers, pick some and go back to raise them.\u201d Zhang Han casually replied.When these words came out, Zhou Fei\u2019s eyes lit up, but Zhang Li shook her head continuously and said:\u201cThat won\u2019t do, we don\u2019t have time to take care of the flowers. If they were died, how sad would it be?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. Sigh, everyone likes beautiful flowers. However, they are too beautiful and do not dare to raise one. Truly a bunch that have big balls.\u201d Zhou Fei\u2019s face turned bitter.Those beautiful flowers were something they did not dare to grow. They were afraid that they would not be able to raise them themselves, so they might as well leave them here. It would be better to come here to admire them when they had time.However, what they did not know was that as long as they had the spirit soil of the Mount New Moon, coupled with the nourishment from the spirit water, not only would they not die, but the flowers would bloom for a long time. Unless the spirit water were nourished, they would wither away.In the current market, technology was developed. In a certain country\u2019s flower company, they had developed a kind of beautiful woman and wild beast rose, which could blossom for more than three years without sunlight or water. If it were placed in a glass bottle, the price of this flower would be between ten thousand to thirty thousand, not to mention the flowers that were grown in the Mount New Moon.If there were no comparison, then there would be no harm, and if they were to compare the things on the market with those of the Mount New Moon, they would probably be depressed to the point of vomiting blood.\u201cOh yeah, boss \u2026\u201d Just when Zhao Feng was about to say something.\u201cPaPa, quickly come over here!\u201dZhang Han was there for a while, and she couldn\u2019t wait for him to go over to play, so she shouted with all her might.Hearing the Little Princess\u2019s call, Zhang Han immediately walked over, with an expression as if he was ignoring everyone else.The corners of his mouth slightly trembled, and with a face full of powerlessness, he followed Zhang Han over.Zhang Li and Zhou Fei who were at the side saw Zhao Feng and started to laugh.\u201cHey, PaPa, why are you so slow? Mengmeng wants to use the remote control to fly; I can\u2019t wait any longer.\u201dWalking forward, Mengmeng carried the remote control aircraft box and eagerly ran towards Zhang Han. The Little Princess insisted on asking PaPa to open the box and get the remote control aircraft ready, not even allowing her Mama to touch it.\u201cI am Coming.\u201d Zhang Han walked a few steps forward and hugged Mengmeng, then returned to the seat beside Zi Yan and sat down. He opened the box and prepared to play with Mengmeng on the plane.\u201cElder Sister Yan, Brother-in-law is really amazing. To be able to create this place, my god, I really didn\u2019t dare to think of that before!\u201d Zhou Fei sat beside Zi Yan and said with admiration.\u201cThat\u2019s right, sister-in-law. I didn\u2019t even know that my brother had this ability. It seems like he became even stronger after being with you.\u201d Zhang Li laughed as she shook her head.At the same time, her heart felt a little emotional, she had never seen her brother like this, with such a sense of responsibility, could this be the change after Mengmeng?Zhang Li didn\u2019t know what she was thinking, but she knew that compared to the previous arrogant and domineering Zhang Han, she liked the current Zhang Han more.Zhang Li and Zhou Fei both sat on cushions but Zhao Feng did not join in the fun. Instead, he greeted Zi Yan with a light smile:\u201cHello, Lady Boss!\u201dIn the face of the few people\u2019s words, Zi Yan merely nodded with a faint smile, and at the same time, glanced at Zhou Fei with a strange expression.The meaning seemed to be saying that it was fine for Zhao Feng to call her the Lady Boss, because he was an outsider after all. Zhang Li might call her sister-in-law, because she was Zhang Han\u2019s younger sister. From last night to now, the name \u2018brother-in-law\u2019 has been mentioned more than thirty times by Zhou Fei, right?Towards this little traitor Zhou Fei, Zi Yan could only reply with the whites of her eyes!\u201cHeehee \u2026\u201d Zhou Fei giggled. Seeing Zi Yan\u2019s expression, she knew, Zi Yan did not really mind this form of address. In other words, she did not reject Zhang Han at all, and there might even be a possibility for her to like him.However, their words, on the other hand, attracted Mengmeng\u2019s attention. The Little Princess turned her head and looked towards Zhou Fei, pouting her cute little mouth as she spoke:\u201cEn hmph, PaPa specially made this for Mengmeng, made it for Mengmeng.\u201dAfter saying that, Mengmeng looked at Zhang Li and continued, \u201cMy PaPa has always been powerful.\u201dIn the end, Mengmeng looked at Zhao Feng with her clear and bright eyes, and said: \u201cHmph, you, you don\u2019t know how to speak. You should say, beautiful boss lady, My mom is the most beautiful.\u201dAfter Mengmeng finished speaking, she turned around to look at Zhang Han, and said with an expression: \u201cPaPa, is what Mengmeng said right?\u201d\u201cHahaha \u2026\u201d Zhang Han laughed heartily; he then used his right hand to caress Mengmeng\u2019s delicate little neck and laughed: \u201cMengmeng is exactly right.\u201d\u201cCluck, cluck, cluck \u2026\u201d Mengmeng laughed very happily.Seeing Mengmeng\u2019s cute appearance, Zi Yan, Zhou Fei, Zhang Li and Zhao Feng could not help but laugh.\u201cAlright, Mengmeng, let\u2019s begin.\u201dZhang Han placed the remote control plane in front of him and held the remote control handle, which looked like a game handle. Zhang Han gave Mengmeng a demonstration as he said, \u201cLook at the button on the left; this is the airplane\u2019s lift button. The one on the right is the change in direction \u2026\u201d\u201cAiya, PaPa, Mengmeng knew about this a long time ago. Mengmeng wants to play, Mengmeng wants to play \u2026\u201dMengmeng had already played with the remote control plane before, so she knew how to control it.Seeing that, Zhang Han laughed, and pulled Mengmeng into his embrace, passing the remote control to Mengmeng, and the Little Princess started to play with the remote control in Zhang Han\u2019s embrace.\u201cWaa, high up, a little higher, hmph, turn left, oh, turn right, aiya, PaPa, the plane is about to fall, what do we do, PaPa, quickly save me \u2026\u201dMengmeng was playing with it. She did not manage to control the plane well, causing it to fall from the side. Seeing that it was about to \u2018crash\u2019, Zhang Han quickly saved the situation, holding onto her small hand and steadily controlling the plane.This caused Mengmeng to burst into laughter. The things she had done in the past were not as happy as the ones she had in PaPa\u2019s arms.After Zhao Feng, Zhang Li, and Zhou Fei chatted for a while; they looked at each other.They all felt that they should give their family a room to themselves.\u201cBro, then we\u2019ll be going back first. Don\u2019t be late; we have to wait for you to go back to cook at noon.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dZhang Han did not even turn his head as he responded with a grunt.Thus, Zhang Li and Zhang Li left reluctantly. On the other hand, Zhao Feng had come to the Mount New Moon a few times already.After they left, Zhang Han and Mengmeng continued to play. Beside them, Zi Yan looked at the father and daughter with a slightly blurred gaze.At this moment, in the livestock area next door.Tai Lake Black Swine, cows, sheep, and ebony sheep were wandering in their areas. The ducklings and geese were playing by the water\u2019s edge, while the adult chickens were drinking water in groups of three or five.Zhang Han unintentionally swept his gaze over.Hm?Suddenly, Zhang Han\u2019s gaze stopped at the adult chicken herd.After looking at it for ten minutes, he found a problem.There were a total of thirty-one mature chicken, and on the day Zi Yan returned, they ate two of them. It should be the last twenty-nine chickens, but now, after Zhang Han observed for a while, there were only twenty-seven chickens.What was going on?Zhang Han passed Mengmeng over to Zi Yan, and after saying that, he walked over to investigate.As for Little Black who was strolling by the side, when it saw Zhang Han walk over, its expression suddenly shrank back. With its tail held between its legs, it walked towards Mengmeng\u2019s side, step by step, as if it was a well-behaved baby.Generally, only when the dog thinks it is wrong will it behave in such a cautious and obedient manner.Zhang Han walked straight to the side of the chicken rack and glanced inside. There were no chickens laying eggs, and outside, there were only twenty-seven chickens. There were indeed two chickens missing.Thus, Zhang Han looked at Little Black, and upon seeing its appearance. Zhang Han waved his hand, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.Little Black walked over with its tail tucked between its legs. It looked like it was\u2019 in the wrong \u2018as it approached with its tongue-tied face.Zhang Han smiled as he shook his head: \u201cYou ate two chickens?\u201dTo Zhang Han, eating a few chickens was not a big deal. After all, Little Black was one of them, but there were only a few chickens in Mount New Moon now.When Little Black heard this, it shook its head, indicating that it did not eat by itself. At the same time, it turned its gaze towards the dense jungle behind it.\u201cOh?\u201dZhang Han frowned and looked over.Could it be that someone else was eating the chicken?The sharpness in Zhang Han\u2019s body flowed through his nose, using his innate ability, Treasure-sniffing nose. In the direction of the forest, Zhang Han felt a stench of blood.And there was the smell of fresh blood.Did someone just eat it? Or was there someone else there?Zhang Han walked towards the direction of the forest, with Little Black\u2019s guilty expression following closely behind him.But just as he reached the edge of the jungle \u2026\u201cPlop!\u201dThe pond at the back suddenly began to emit a splashing sound.Zhang Han turned to look, only to see Mengmeng anxiously shouting out: \u201cMama, ma!\u201dDid she fall into the water?\u2026\u2026When his gaze returned to Mengmeng\u2019s side, right when Zhang Han was about to step into the forest.The plane controlled by Mengmeng fell down once again.\u201cAiya, Mama, Mama, the plane is about to crash!\u201dZi Yan frantically tried to salvage the situation, but she was unable to salvage the plane that fell. The plane almost fell into the pond and hung itself on the hollies on the inside.Zi Yan walked over to prepare the remotely piloted aircraft, her body leaned forward a bit, but she wasn\u2019t able to balance her body and fell into the water with a splash.She didn\u2019t expect the pool to be so deep. Originally, she could swim, but for a moment she was somewhat panicked. She kept slapping against the surface of the water with her hands.Seeing that, Zhang Han jumped in shock, and immediately retreated. He circulated the spirit energy in his body and both legs, and his entire body floated up, with a point at the tip of the blade, he moved forward seven or eight meters, and when he was near, Zhang Han\u2019s feet touched the water surface.It was like a dragonfly touching the water lightly. It did not raise any big waves as it advanced forward step by step.If Zi Yan were to see this scene, she would definitely be shocked beyond belief.But now she couldn\u2019t care less.With a distance of around 200 metres, Zhang Han only used 10 seconds!When he was near, Zhang Han jumped into the water and dove into the water. Like a fish, he swam over quickly and caught Zi Yan, and pulled her up.\u201cPfft \u2026\u201d Cough cough cough \u2026 \u201cPhew\u2026\u201dZi Yan spat out a few mouthfuls of water, took a deep breath, and dragged by Zhang Han to the edge of the lake.Zhang Han held her hand the entire time, and went ashore first. Then, he pulled Zi Yan up, and carried her in his arms.\u201cMama, ma, wu wu \u2026\u201d \u201cMama, how are you \u2026\u201dMengmeng cried out anxiously at the side.Zi Yan coughed a few times, took a few deep breaths, and smiled at Mengmeng: \u201cMama is fine, Mengmeng won\u2019t cry, be good.\u201dAfter that, Zhang Han walked to the cushions while carrying Zi Yan, but Mengmeng did not cry at all. There were still crystal clear tears hanging from the corners of her eyes.After placing Zi Yan down lightly on the cushion, she had also recovered her strength and consoled Mengmeng for a while. During this time, Zhang Han sat beside her and watched quietly.After a while, Mengmeng became happy again. Zi Yan laughed lightly as she rubbed Mengmeng\u2019s head, turned her head and looked at Zhang Han with a rebuking gaze, and said:\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that the water was so deep?\u201dLittle did she know that the moment she turned around, her beautiful figure was completely revealed in Zhang Han\u2019s field of vision.Zi Yan was wearing a thin, white sports attire. After she was completely drenched, the pink colored undergarment that she was wearing was completely revealed, revealing her voluptuous undergarments, her perky underclothes, and her figure that had angles and ravines.At this moment, it was as if she was covered by a thin layer of white gauze.This sort of temptation, which was faintly discernible, dazzled the eyes of others.Zhang Han\u2019s gaze uncontrollably swept up and down, and there was some astonishment in his eyes.At first, looking at Zi Yan\u2019s figure, he felt that she was a bit thin, the upper part of her body would not be big, but he never expected that her body would be so well-developed!Zhang Han was secretly praising them in his heart, as he looked at them openly.When Zi Yan noticed his gaze, she looked down and realized that she had missed something, and her face flushed red. She glanced at Zhang Han with her beautiful eyes and scolded softly:\u201cWhat are you looking at!\u201dLiked it?

    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - Little shynessPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cEh \u2026\u201dWhen Zhang Han saw Zi Yan\u2019s rosy red face with her beautiful eyes flickering, he only felt a little tempted in his heart.\u201cPaPa, what are you looking at?\u201dMengmeng imitated Zi Yan\u2019s tone, staring with her big eyes, pouting her small mouth as she spoke, her small appearance was as cute as it could get.Seeing that, Zhang Han shook his head and chuckled, he looked at Zi Yan and said: \u201cLet\u2019s go back first, your clothes are all wet, you must be uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zi Yan lightly tapped her forehead.Not only was she wet and uncomfortable, but the way Zhang Han looked at her also felt uncomfortable!\u2018Hmph, this bastard is always bullying me, because I am Mengmeng\u2019s mother.Zi Yan secretly snorted in her heart, but she did not reveal all of this on her face.It was enough to say that she did not treat Zhang Han as an outsider. Otherwise, forget about such an expression, Zhang Han would not even see Zi Yan\u2019s smiling face.After Zi Yan got up, Zhang Han put away the parasol and cushion.It was only then that Mengmeng remembered her remotely piloted plane. She spoke a little anxiously: \u201cAiya, PaPa, the plane crashed. We are going to save the plane!\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhang Han just replied and was about to go get the plane.However, just as Zhang Han took a step forward, Little Black who was by his side bellowed and ran over.Its speed was very fast, and its four legs were moving up and down.It was helpless, it was the little steward of the territory. When Zhang Han realized that there were two fewer chickens, Little Black felt that it had stirred up some trouble, and now, it wanted to perform even better.Little Black\u2019s speed was extremely fast. After running for about ten seconds, it arrived at the edge of the pond. With a leap, its entire body jumped up more than a meter, and it opened its mouth to bite down on the remote control aircraft that was hung on the holly.\u201cPlop!\u201dLittle Black fell into the pond and then calmly swam up. It had a fawning expression on its face as it came over with the plane.Actually, Zi Yan\u2019s falling into the water was somewhat related to Zhang Han. Normally, Little Black would look after the matters of the territory, and when Zhang Han called Little Black away, that would happen. If Little Black were here, it would definitely not have let Zi Yan do anything dangerous.But if Zi Yan did not fall into the water, Zhang Han would not be able to see her beautiful figure and her embarrassed expression.\u201cHmm hah, the Little Black is so powerful.\u201dMengmeng took the remote-controlled aircraft, extended her hand and patted Little Black\u2019s head.Little Black happily circled around Mengmeng a few times. Seeing this, Zhang Han smiled and shook his head; he saw Little Black\u2019s gaze secretly sizing him up.It\u2019s just stealing two chickens, what\u2019s the big deal.Zhang Han never planned to punish Little Black in the first place. As a member of the same clan and also a housekeeper of the territory, the treatment of Little Black would naturally not be bad.After Mengmeng bid farewell to Little Black and the other dogs, she prepared to leave the mountain with Zhang Han and Zi Yan.Arriving in front of the panda car, Zhang Han thought for a while, then took off his jacket, draped it over Zi Yan\u2019s body, and said:\u201cWear it, don\u2019t catch a cold \u2026\u201dZi Yan\u2019s expression paused for a moment, and lightly tapped her forehead.She sat in the back seat with Mengmeng, and only when Zhang Han was about to get on the car did he remember Pure yang water. He forgot about it.\u201cI need to get something.\u201dZhang Han said as he turned and walked towards the Mount New Moon.Zi Yan looked at Zhang Han\u2019s back from the carriage and snorted.He even said not to catch a cold. In such a hot day, he obviously used his big clothes to cover her body. If he was afraid of her catching a cold, why did he not give her clothes earlier? Why did he have to go down the mountain?Although she thought this in her heart, Zi Yan still felt comfortable. After all, from this small detail, she could tell that Zhang Han still cared about her, and that it would be a little awkward if she really went back like this.Zhang Han returned to the thunder yang tree and filled a small milk bucket with Pure Yang Water, then he went down the mountain again and drove back to the restaurant.Originally, Zhang Han planned to play until around noon before returning. However, as Zi Yan had fallen into the water, they were back more than an hour early.It was also because she had fallen into the water that they had to wait so long for lunch.Returning to the dining hall, Zhang Li was chatting with Zhou Fei.When they saw that Zhang Han and Zi Yan were drenched from head to toe, they were surprised.\u201cOh! Elder Sister Yan, we only came back from the mountain for a short while. What did you, you and brother-in-law do? Are you playing with mandarin-duck game? \u201d Zhou Fei said with an \u2018I\u2019m shocked\u2019 expression.\u201cStupid girl, are you talking nonsense? Let me sew your mouth shut!\u201d Zi Yan glared fiercely at her.\u201cEn hmph, that\u2019s not it, it\u2019s Mama, Mama! She wanted to help Mengmeng fall off the plane, and then, Mama fell off into the water. PaPa flew over quickly, and saved Mama!\u201d Mengmeng explained what happened as she pouted. She had seen Zhang Han flying on the water.Although Mengmeng did not understand how big and tall treading on water meant, but she felt that the PaPa was so cool back then!Zhang Han laughed as he rubbed Mengmeng\u2019s head. He did not mind letting his family see the scene of him becoming strong. As time passed by, they would realize more things, and Zhang Han would bring his family members along to cultivate in the future.There was a lot of truth in this saying that a man could ascend the path of the heavens.Furthermore, Zhang Han\u2019s first step on the surface of the water was not true treading on the water; it was only based on the premise that he could run a certain distance in the water with his current speed.With Zhang Han\u2019s current strength, he could only run for a few hundred meters on the water surface. To tread on the water surface, he would need to attain Foundation Stage that could emit spirit energy.\u201cLet\u2019s go to change clothes.\u201dAfter said that, Zhang Han and Zi Yan headed to the second floor.At this time, Zhang Li also teased:\u201cBrother, yesterday you said that you want to sleep on the sofa. But you said let\u2019s change clothes today. Hehe, it seems like you and sister-in-law have a good relationship.\u201dZi Yan, who was walking in front, almost staggered, she did not turn back, her face slightly flushed, and quickly walked towards the second floor.\u201cIt\u2019s all your fault!\u201d After entering the bedroom, Zi Yan rolled her eyes at Zhang Han in a bad mood. She didn\u2019t even realize how charming and moving her tone was.Zhang Han was baffled. Why are you blaming me?On the other hand, after Zi Yan said that, she started rummaging through her clothes in the luggage, while Zhang Han took out a new set of casual clothes from his wardrobe, and went to the second bedroom to change clothes.When Zhang Han walked out, the main bedroom\u2019s door was still closed. Presumably, Zi Yan was still changing her clothes, so Zhang Han directly went downstairs.In the master bedroom, Zi Yan took off her wet clothes and placed them to the side. In reality, she was wearing a set of white undergarments, but even so, it revealed her perfect and graceful figure.\u2018Which one are you wearing? \u2018Looking at the clothes in front of him, Zi Yan didn\u2019t know how to choose. Sometimes, people would always have difficulty choosing their clothes, and many women would go back and forth when they were carefully dressing up, making it easier for men to do so.Because they don\u2019t have enough clothes!\u2018Which one? \u2018Zi Yan looked at the pretty garment that \u2018Zhang Han\u2019 bought for her with a somewhat hesitant expression:\u201cHe just gave them to me yesterday, and I\u2019m already wearing them today. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little bad?\u201d\u201cWill he think too much? \u201cWould he think I like him?\u201d\u201cLike him? \u201cHmph, how is that possible!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t wear it!\u201dZi Yan\u2019s gaze once again returned to the trunk, choosing again and again, but she still wasn\u2019t able to make a decision. Hence, her gaze once again couldn\u2019t help but drift towards the clothes, stretching her hand out, hesitantly muttering:\u201cThe clothes he choose are pretty, and his eyesight is pretty good. So why don\u2019t I wear it?\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d It\u2019s not because of him! Just wear this! \u201dIn the end, Zi Yan still wore the clothes, and her lower body matched up with a pair of super shorts.At this time, everyone downstairs was seated at the dining table. Zhang Han hugged Mengmeng and interacted with her in his arms.When Zi Yan walked down from the stairs.Everyone\u2019s eyes turned towards Zi Yan in unison! Seeing Zi Yan walking over gracefully, everyone\u2019s eyes lit up!If it was said that the Zi Yan of the morning was dressed like a sports wind, then the Zi Yan of now had a cute, yet wild style.\u201cWoo woo, it\u2019s so beautiful!\u201d Mengmeng could not help but wave her arm and say.Hearing her daughter\u2019s praise, Zi Yan\u2019s mouth raised up slightly, and walked over to Mengmeng and sat on the left side of her.\u201cAiyo, Elder Sister Yan, you really know how to dress up more and more. Tsk tsk, why didn\u2019t I realize this before, could it be \u2026\u201d Zhou Fei wanted to make fun of her.Before she could finish her words, Zi Yan opened her mouth first:\u201cSomeone is talking nonsense. Don\u2019t even think about drinking that kind of water.\u201d\u201cBurp!\u201d Zhou Fei braked and stopped herself from speaking. She burped and stared at Zi Yan, her expression instantly becoming obedient and saying:\u201cIs there beauty water? Ah! Elder Sister Yan, you are the best, Elder Sister Yan, you are so beautiful, I will not speak carelessly anymore, I promise, I swear, I will not speak carelessly anymore. \u201d\u201cThen remember it, hmph.\u201d Zi Yan let out a grunt, looked at Zhang Han, and said: \u201cGive some of the water to Fei Fei.\u201d\u201cYes, we\u2019ve prepared a lot this time. Everyone can drink a bit more.\u201d Zhang Han nodded, he stood up and walked out.\u201cHehehehe, brother-in-law is the best!\u201d Zhou Fei said joyfully: \u201cThank you, brother-in-law!\u201dZi Yan could not help but roll her eyes at these words.As it turned out, a woman\u2019s promises were just \u2018promises\u2019 and \u2018oaths\u2019. It was just a simple word.Very quickly, Zhang Han brought the water bucket back. At the same time, Zhou Fei had already prepared several cups, and even prepared for Zhao Feng.Zhang Han took the water and poured it for everyone. This time, the quantity was enough for everyone to drink.Zhao Feng was not courteous at all, he was extremely curious about this kind of beautiful water. After drinking it, Zhang Han, Zi Yan, Zhang Li, and Mengmeng did not have much reaction, but Zhou Fei and Zhao Feng\u2019s reaction was extremely intense. Not even two seconds had passed after drinking it, both of their stomachs continuously rumbled.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 - Mengmeng wanted to hear it?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euFortunately, there was a bathroom upstairs and downstairs in the restaurant.Zhou Fei went upstairs and Zhao Feng was downstairs. Roughly twenty minutes later, the two of them walked out with a face full of energy.\u201cElder Sister Yan, take a look. See if my skin is smooth or not. Hahaha.\u201d Zhou Fei was so happy that she couldn\u2019t even close her mouth. After running over, she brought her face closer to Zi Yan\u2019s side for her to see.Without waiting for Zi Yan to speak, Zhou Fei once again moved her head closer to Mengmeng\u2019s side, and said: \u201cCome Mengmeng, the skin of the Aunty Feifei is extremely good right now.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Mengmeng asked, confused.\u201cKiss one!\u201d Zhou Fei extended a finger and pointed at her cheek.\u201cEn hmph, no, PaPa won\u2019t allow it.\u201d Mengmeng rejected her shamelessly. She then extended her hand and pushed Zhou Fei\u2019s head backwards.The little guy knew, she could not kiss others, and even more could not let others kiss her. Otherwise, PaPa would be angry.\u201cHumph!\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, then don\u2019t!\u201d Zhou Fei snorted lightly, not minding at all. With beauty water, her skin would be better, but she was extremely happy.Then she sat down beside her and began to stink in the little mirror.\u201cBoss, this water \u2026\u201dZhao Feng sat beside Zhang Han, with a tone of disbelief.There were all sorts of beauty products sold on the market, but he had never heard of anything that could improve a person\u2019s skin like the effect of drinking water just now.There was an old saying: one\u2019s hair is long and his knowledge is short, but Zhao Feng felt that in this restaurant, other than the owner, all other people, regardless of their age or gender, had become short-sighted.In the face of Zhao Feng\u2019s words, Zhang Han did not explain. Even if he told them about the spirit treasure, they would not understand.\u201cCough.\u201d While speaking, Zi Yan suddenly coughed lightly, her beautiful eyes turned towards Zhang Han, and said: \u201cShould someone play a song for us?\u201dPaPa plays the piano, even Mengmeng wants to play the piano, PaPa, let\u2019s go quickly! Hearing that, Mengmeng remembered that Mama still did not know she could play the piano, so she anxiously reached out her hands, wanting to embrace Zhang Han.Seeing that, Zhang Han shook his head and laughed, he then stood up and hugged Mengmeng tightly. He walked to the piano and placed Mengmeng on the small sofa, then opened the piano and prepared to play.\u201cBoss, I heard that his piano skills. It\u2019s in no way inferior to Director Lang\u2019s. He\u2019s very powerful, and he is one of the best among all masters.\u201d Zhao Feng thought about what Zhao Dahu had said.Zhao Feng didn\u2019t really understand much about the piano, he only knew that the piano music that Zhang Han played was especially pleasing to the ears, and as the vice director of the entertainment company, Zhao Dahu had a lot of understanding and authority to speak of in this regard.\u201cMaster? \u201cHow could that be!\u201d Zhang Li curled her lips and said: \u201cMy brother was previously level 10 Amateur and has not played for many years, how could he become a Master?\u201dZhang Li had a thorough understanding of her brother, and knew what level he was at a few years ago. However, what she did not know was that Zhang Han\u2019s age at zither was at least five hundred years.\u201cDamn, Brother-in-law is actually at level 10?\u201d \u201cAwesome, awesome!\u201d Zhou Fei raised her thumb again and again.\u201cHe can play the piano. How unexpected.\u201d Zi Yan smiled slightly.Regardless of whether he was level 10 or some other level, being able to play the piano was pretty good. This proved that the guy really liked music.Zhao Feng saw and shook his head with a smile without a word, they did not seem to believe that the boss was a grandmaster pianist, and upon seeing it with their own eyes, they would probably be shocked.\u201cWhat song would you like to hear?\u201dWhen Zhang Han was about to play the piano, he turned his head and asked. Even though it was a question, his gaze was fixed on Zi Yan.This made Zhou Fei and Zhang Li, who wanted to order some tune, to shut their mouths.This first piece of the piano piece was obviously for Zi Yan, the landlady.\u201cListen \u2026\u201d Zi Yan muttered to herself for a moment, thinking about the piano pieces that she knew in her mind, she thought for a moment, then replied: \u201cIt\u2019s just Melody of the Night.\u201d\u201cAh, Melody of the Night. It\u2019s the piano piece of the dark sky.\u201d Mengmeng clapped her hands to welcome Zhang Han\u2019s performance.After Mengmeng clapped her hands a few times, the scene gradually quietened down.One second, two seconds \u2026After twenty seconds, under everyone\u2019s expectant gaze, Zhang Han\u2019s hand started to move.An expert would know whether or not it was true the moment he made a move.Zhang Han had just played the melody a few times, causing everyone\u2019s spirits to rise.Some people played a piano piece, but only the sound of the piano piece had no spirit. However, there were also people who played a piano piece, which was extremely beautiful and captivating.Zi Yan, Zhou Fei and Zhang Li all stared wide-eyed at the start, but slowly, they couldn\u2019t help but get drunk and enjoy the beautiful music.Especially Zhou Fei and Zi Yan who understood music. At this moment, they felt goosebumps all over their bodies when they heard it.Night in the piano music series, each capital has different feelings, recorded one night after another happy, sad, and, of course, happy feelings.The music style was mainly in the Healing Department. Every song in this series was quiet and soothing, causing the hearts and souls of the people to linger in it. The fifth song was the most popular, and the night zither music that people often spoke of was the fifth song in this series.After the song ended, there was no applause. They were all enchanted by the serene atmosphere.On the other hand, Zhao Feng was a lot better. After all, he had heard Zhang Han play it a few times, so his endurance would naturally be a bit greater.\u201cPaPa is so powerful.\u201dMengmeng\u2019s childish voice brought them back to their thoughts.\u201cI\u2026 \u201cF * ck!\u201dBefore Zi Yan could say anything, Zhou Fei suddenly slammed the table and stood up, she stared with wide eyes, gasped for breath at Zhang Han and said:\u201cOh my god! \u201cBrother-in-law, so this Stewart isn\u2019t just for show. Amazing! Brother-in-law, you\u2019re too awesome, I\u2019m really going to admire you. Oh god, it\u2019s so delicious to cook, and the piano is also so good to play. I even want to be invincible. I believe brother-in-law, you\u2019re really a master!\u201d\u201cFei Fei, aren\u2019t you exaggerating?\u201d Zi Yan didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, and patted her.\u201cIt\u2019s not exaggerated at all; it\u2019s not exaggerated at all. PaPa is the super invincible most powerful.\u201d Mengmeng cheered.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Brother-in-law is amazing; brother-in-law is awesome \u2026\u201d Zhou Fei looked like a brainless fan.\u201cHurry up and sit down!\u201d Zi Yan pulled Zhou Fei back to her seat, her eyes filled with killing intent allowed Zhou Fei\u2019s emotions to calm down.This careless Zhou Fei would always say some vulgar words in front of Meng Meng.\u201cWhat else do you want to hear?\u201d At this time, Zhang Han asked again.Zi Yan thought for a bit, and just as she was about to speak, Zhou Fei spoke first:\u201cBrother-in-law, do you know how to play the third piano concerto? If you can use that, then you\u2019re really amazing! \u201dAfter saying that, Zi Yan was slightly stunned, she pursed her lips and looked at Zhou Fei, and said:\u201cThis third piano concerto is one of the world\u2019s ten great difficult pianos. It is also a large piece of work, famous for its strong emotional expression and difficult performance skills; this piece is known as the king of the piano concerto. Zhang Han, I wonder if you can play this?\u201dZi Yan really hoped that Zhang Han would be good at the piano. If that was the case, then she and Zhang Han might be able to perform a show regarding marriage in the future \u2026 Pah pah pah! Where did he go?Zhang Li and Zhao Feng did not know about this song, but after hearing that it was one of the top ten difficult songs in the world, they understood the concept behind it.Most people liked the melodious style of the piano pieces during the night. However, for those with high difficulty levels, many people were not used to listening to them, while those professionals would be mesmerized by them.If it were another person asking Zhang Han, Zi Yan would probably feel troubled, but after listening to Zhang Han\u2019s tune, Zi Yan also wanted to know what level Zhang Han was.\u201cThird Piano Concerto?\u201d Zhang Han shook his head and said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d \u201cIt can\u2019t be?\u201d Zhou Fei was slightly stunned, and couldn\u2019t help but look a little disappointed.Even Zi Yan had that feeling, because the expectations just now were too big, when she heard such a word, she couldn\u2019t help but feel that it was a little bit different.Mengmeng waved her small arms and stopped. She did not understand what was happening when she saw Zhou Fei and the others\u2019 expressions.\u201cPaPa, how could you, how could you not know, PaPa is the strongest.\u201dIn the little princess\u2019 heart, PaPa is an invincible existence!When Mengmeng opened her mouth, a light flashed across Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes!He had been in the restaurant for a while now, and Zhao Feng knew that as long as Mengmeng asked, there was nothing that Zhang Han could not solve.It was just that he didn\u2019t know whether Zhang Han would be able to maintain his legendary omnipotent father this time around.Sure enough, after Mengmeng opened her mouth, Zhang Han\u2018s expression paused for a moment.He turned his body, took out his mobile phone from his pocket, smiled and patted Mengmeng\u2019s head, and said: \u201cMengmeng wants to hear it?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Mengmeng nodded her head obediently. She liked the surprises of others when PaPa was the most powerful.\u201cThen daddy, take a look at the score.\u201d Zhang Han used his phone to search for the piano piece.The score was very long, but Zhang Han was looking at it in ten lines. The spirit energy in his body was circulating around his head, allowing his memory to reach the state of Eyeless Memory, so much less a mere piano piece, even if he were to bring over the entire set of the class, it would only be a matter of two hours.Seeing Zhang Han\u2019s appearance, Zhou Fei and the rest were slightly startled.\u201cOn the go, on the go? Brother-in-law, can you do it? \u201d Zhou Fei said with some suspicion.\u201cIf he says so, so be it. Let\u2019s just wait and see.\u201d Zi Yan smiled slightly, she had confidence in Zhang Han. From meeting Mengmeng, letting him come to Hong Kong, visiting the Peach Blossom Valley, coming to this restaurant, Zhang Han had never gone back on his words.\u201cI believe my brother can do it too. Isn\u2019t it just a tune? What\u2019s the big deal!\u201d Zhang Li snorted.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a problem with songs, but it\u2019s a problem with difficulty. To be able to become one of the top 10 in the world, how could it be played by a normal level 10 \u2026\u201dZhou Fei laughed bitterly, wanting to indirectly explain the difficulty of the song, but before she could finish, the melodious sound of a piano playing.Liked it?

    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - Astonishing (Third)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euShua shua shua!The few of them turned to look at the source of the voice.Zhang Han\u2019s fingers had already started dancing on the piano.In the beginning, it was a rather melodious prelude. Although it was a melody, its speed was much faster than that of an ordinary song. It was much more complicated, and all of them revealed their positions as one of the top ten difficult songs!\u201cThis \u2026\u201dZhou Fei was dumbstruck.Just a few minutes? Could he play the music just by looking at the score? How is this possible? He must have been fooling people before!In an instant, all these thoughts flashed through Zhou Fei\u2019s mind. She simply could not believe that someone would be able to remember this piece of music in just a few minutes!At this time, Zi Yan, Zhang Li and Zhao Feng had strange looks in their eyes as well.Zi Yan and Zhang Li did not really believe that Zhang Han played it for crash course, because it was too unbelievable.However, in Zhao Feng heart, he felt that the boss might really be watching the show from the sidelines. It could be said that his confidence in Zhang Han was the greatest on the scene.The few of them were a little confused at first, but they gradually invested themselves into the music ceremony.Zhang Han played the third piano concerto. It was melodious, even slower than the original, and when it was compact, his speed was ridiculously much faster, causing the song to have a soul-shaking effect.It also seemed to give this piano piece a different color, making the room silent except for the sound of the piano.Unknowingly, the piano piece came to an end and gradually ended.\u201cWow.\u201d Mengmeng opened her eyes wide, staring at PaPa without blinking, with a face like a little chick. She cheered out loud: \u201cPaPa, PaPa is too handsome, too awesome!\u201d\u201cHe is really powerful.\u201d Zi Yan looked at Zhang Han with amazement and admiration, and said: \u201cI really didn\u2019t expect that your piano skills would already be at the level of a grandmaster; you\u2019re truly amazing.\u201dWhile talking, Zi Yan\u2019s eyes shone with a strange light. She was really happy at that moment.She was furious when Zhang Han said that actors were actually show people. But now, Zi Yan felt that it was just Zhang Han\u2019s angry words; since he understood music, he must also understand the dream of the musician.\u2018Hmph, this bastard. When he\u2019s angry, he\u2019ll say anything. What a bastard! \u2018\u2018Hehehehe, he really knows how to play the piano. It looks like he\u2019s quite handsome.\u2018Master Piano, hmph, maybe we can even write songs together in the future! \u2018\u2018No, that\u2019s not right. He\u2019ll have to beg me. Otherwise, I won\u2019t talk to him first, hmph.At this time, Zi Yan\u2019s heart was actually as complicated and messy as a girl\u2019s, but at the same time, it was filled with joy.All of this was because Zhang Han was too surprising to her. When that small knot in her heart was resolved, she naturally felt great, and it was understandable that her mood would become a little complicated.Of course, it was normal for a weirdo like Zi Yan, who had children without having experienced love, to have a girl\u2019s heart.\u201cOh my god! \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation?\u201dSuddenly, Zhou Fei jumped up from her chair, she looked at Zhang Han in shock and fear; her body could not help but tremble, revealing her extremely excited emotions.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zi Yan returned to her senses and looked at her in confusion.Why did it seem like she was in a daze?\u201cOh my god, Elder Sister Yan, oh my god, how long has it been? Oh my god, 20 minutes! Brother-in-law only used 20 minutes to play this piano piece. Damn, isn\u2019t this too inconceivable? \u201cHow is that possible? This is going to break the world record!\u201dZhou Fei\u2019s face was filled with excitement, and she was at a loss of what to do.When these words came out, the complexions of Zi Yan, Zhang Li and Zhao Feng all slightly changed.\u201cAre you for real?\u201d Only twenty minutes? \u201d Zi Yan subconsciously stood up.\u201cIt\u2019s true. When we first started playing, it was 10: 50 PM. Now it\u2019s 11: 10 PM. It\u2019s definitely 20 minutes!\u201d Zhou Fei pointed to the watch on her wrist.\u201cAH!\u201d Zi Yan let out a soft cry as she covered her lips with her lily-white hands. She looked at Zhang Han with her eyes wide opened, and for a moment, did not know what to say.As for Zhao Feng and Zhang Li, although they did not understand the specific meaning behind those words, they knew that Zhang Han\u2019s actions just now must have been too shocking!\u201cHumph!\u201dHowever, it was Mengmeng who said with a proud expression, \u201cPaPa is \u2026 um \u2026 the most powerful. \u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right; your dad is really crazy! Aiyaya, what a pity! I should have been recording it just now. Sigh, if I were to record it on the internet, it would definitely be able to cause a huge earthquake in the piano industry! \u201cWhy am I so stupid? I should have recorded it. Aiyo, my little darling \u2026\u201d Zhou Fei said with a frown.Seeing her expression, Zi Yan knew that she was truly upset. She glanced at Zhang Han and coughed lightly to remind him: \u201cThe song was not recorded, but he is right there.\u201d\u201cBurp!\u201dShe quickly reacted and looked towards Zhang Han. She took out her phone to directly record a video and said at the same time, \u201cBrother-in-law, brother-in-law, if you come again, with your skills, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to beat everything up in the piano industry! When you get hot, I\u2019ll be your manager. No, I\u2019ll be the same manager for you and Elder Sister Yan, the husband and wife combination, oh god, it\u2019s a perfect match! \u201dHer words were incoherent, but her expression, tone, and words all expressed the excitement in her heart.Zhang Han looked at Zhou Fei, slightly speechless. This girl was a little crazy. Did Zhang Han still play it after recording just a moment ago?He wasn\u2019t in the mood to play with her, but just when he was about to refuse, Mengmeng who was at the side already opened her mouth and refused:\u201cEn hmph, PaPa played it twice, it is time for Mengmeng to perform.\u201d\u201cCome on, Mengmeng.\u201d Zhang Han ignored Zhou Fei, smiled at Mengmeng and then hugged her in his arms.\u201cHey, Mama, are you ready? Mengmeng is about to begin.\u201d Mengmeng reminded her before she played the music.\u201cMama, get ready. Let\u2019s begin.\u201d\u201cHmm, it\u2019s starting.\u201dMengmeng replied happily as she pressed down on the piano key.A clear and melodious sound of a zither rang out, accompanied by Mengmeng\u2019s childish yet pleasant voice:\u201cTwinkle, Twinkle Little Star, How I Wonder What You Are \u2026\u201dAfter singing for two minutes, Mengmeng retracted her hand, and asked with a face full of anticipation: \u201cHow is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too nice!\u201d Mengmeng is so powerful. \u201d Zi Yan clapped first.Zhao Feng, Zhang Li, and Zhou Fei also clapped together as they praised:\u201cEven Mengmeng can play the piano at such a young age.\u201d\u201cMengmeng will definitely be even more powerful in the future.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMengmeng\u2019s treatment in the restaurant could be said to be the highest.Because she was a cute and beautiful little girl, and also because she was Zi Yan\u2019s daughter, but also because she was the treasure in Zhang Han\u2019s hands.Hearing the praises of the few of them, Mengmeng was extremely happy as she laughed non-stop.\u201cHey hey hey, brother-in-law, don\u2019t put it down. Do you want to play that song again?\u201dSeeing that Zhang Han was about to put down the lid, Zhou Fei hurriedly said.However, Zhang Han didn\u2019t even bother to pay attention to him, as he directly put down the zither lid and returned to the dining table with Mengmeng in his arms. Only now did he look at the dumbfounded Zhou Fei, and said: \u201cNext time then.\u201d\u201cNext time \u2026\u201d Zhou Fei\u2019s expression froze as she said somewhat vexedly.\u201cUn humph, PaPa only plays twice every time.\u201d Mengmeng added.\u201cYes, the boss can only play two piano pieces at a time, and it might not even be at every meal. Every time we hear it, we don\u2019t hear enough.\u201d Zhao Feng said with a chuckle.\u201cHuh?\u201d Zi Yan looked at Zhang Han strangely, and said: \u201cYou even have such a rule?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not really a rule. After eating dinner, you can take a rest and play two piano pieces at the same time.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cThen Brother-in-law, can you play it again?\u201d Zhou Fei said again. She was thinking of recording this video for Zhang Han now, and she knew that once this video was uploaded to the internet, it would cause a huge wave that would fill the entire world\u2019s piano industry!But Zhang Han still shook his head and said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to play.\u201dWith these words, he rejected Zhou Fei.Seeing Zhou Fei\u2019s vexed expression, Zhang Han said in amusement: \u201cIt\u2019s almost 11: 30, I should be preparing lunch. I think the customers will all be coming up soon.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll record the video for you next time.\u201d Zhou Fei nodded obediently.\u201cBro, what are we having for lunch?\u201dHearing that Zhang Han was going to cook, Zhang Li immediately became spirited. She was truly a gluttonous foodie!\u201cThere are a few potatoes, as well as beans and cucumbers. What would you like to eat?\u201d Zhang Han said casually.In this world, these ingredients are already considered top in the world. But in the end, Zhang Han had tasted the rare delicacies of the myriad heavens and earth before, so his standards were much higher than normal. Even when he ate, he felt that it was only ordinary food, but others didn\u2019t think so!Hearing Zhang Han\u2019s question, Zhao Feng was somehow excited in his heart. He felt that if he got to know the boss, he could probably order dishes!\u201cI want chicken!\u201d Zhang Li said very happily.\u201cI want meat too.\u201d Zhou Fei quickly added.\u201cI also\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Zi Yan said softly.\u201cEh \u2026.\u201d I\u2019ll eat whatever the boss cooks. \u201dZhao Feng felt that he didn\u2019t have the right to speak, and at the same time, he felt that the boss would eat whatever he cooked, so he replied accordingly.\u201cChicken can\u2019t be done at noon, but it can be done at night.\u201d Zhang Han replied.\u201cOh yeah, Brother-in-law, is there any noodles?\u201d Zhou Fei glanced at Zi Yan and reminded him: \u201cElder Sister Yan likes to eat noodles, for example, wonton, noodles, hand-rolled noodles and so on. Oh yeah, there\u2019s also hot pot. Elder Sister Yan especially likes to eat hot pot. Brother-in-law, I gave you all this news for free.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dZhang Han looked at her and replied indifferently.Seeing that, Zi Yan was secretly relieved.What do you mean?Liked it?

    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - That incident from the beginningPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euOn the other hand, Mengmeng raised her little hand and said, \u201cMengmeng also really likes to eat hotpot. Hmm, and there\u2019s even some noodles that I like to eat as well.\u201d\u201cMengmeng likes to eat noodles too?\u201d Zhang Han\u2019s reaction was much stronger than before. He looked at Mengmeng and said without hesitation: \u201cAlright, then we\u2019ll eat noodles at noon.\u201dLittle did he know that these words made Zi Yan feel a sense of jealousy.How could he be like this? Why didn\u2019t he ask me? Ignore the landlady?Zi Yan\u2019s mood instantly fell to the bottom. While feeling jealous, she was also a bit unhappy.This bastard, can\u2019t he just ask her that? Even a polite remark would be fine?Hmph, ignore him in the future! He wants to court me just like this? Just you wait! Bastard!Zi Yan\u2019s killing intent towards Zhang Han had already surged, but Zhang Han did not know what was going on. Instead, he muttered to himself and looked at Mengmeng: \u201cThen what pasta does Mengmeng want to eat? Steamed Bun? Noodle or wonton or something? \u201dThere were too many types of pasta; Zhang Han didn\u2019t know what to do either. And the key issue was that there weren\u2019t many ingredients here so that he would be greatly restricted.For example, there were steamed buns, Soup Dumplings, beef buns, pork buns and other meat buns. There were squash and egg buns, leek and egg buns, etc.\u201cI want to eat that; it\u2019s that noodle, hmm\u2026 Very thin\u2026 Mama, what is that? \u201d Mengmeng described it for a while, but she did not know what kind of noodles she had eaten before.\u201cThey are fine dried noodles.\u201d Zi Yan replied as her beautiful eyes rolled into a white line.Zi Yan did not know how to cook. When she was with her children, the nanny usually cook, or head out to the dining area. Sometimes she would eat Western cuisine, sometimes she would eat some noodle soup, but relatively speaking, she ate hotpot for most time.Zi Yan loved to eat noodles; even Mengmeng liked to eat it since she was young. And that fine dried noodle, which was the only thing that Zi Yan knew how to make; she had been cooked a few times for Mengmeng since she was young. Adults and children all liked to eat it a lot.\u201cThat\u2019s right; They are just fine dried noodles.\u201d Mengmeng chuckled.\u201cThen we\u2019ll make thin noodles for Mengmeng at noon!\u201d Zhang Han laughed as he rubbed Mengmeng\u2019s head.\u201cHumph!\u201d I went upstairs. \u201d Zi Yan rolled her eyes at Zhang Han again.This made Zhang Han quite confused. Why was this girl always so unfriendly with him?Of course, Zhang Han knew that it was a good thing to have this kind of \u2018unfriendly\u2019 attitude; it was just like saying that his girlfriend would have a bad temper. Sometimes, her boyfriend would really hate himself for making trouble, but he didn\u2019t know that only his girlfriend would like to do that.However, if she really started to have a short temper with others, he wouldn\u2019t be that far away from being broken up.Of course, Zhang Han knew about this too. Sometimes, Zi Yan treated him differently from others, and it was actually a good start. If Zhang Han didn\u2019t even know about this, then his EQ wouldn\u2019t be too low?Returning to the main topic, when Mengmeng saw that Mama was about to go upstairs, she extended her arms for Mama.Zi Yan carried Mengmeng in one go, and when she felt Mengmeng\u2019s weight, she chuckled and patted Mengmeng\u2019s little butt a few times. She laughed: \u201cMengmeng seems to be heavier than usual, looks like I won\u2019t be able to carry you in a while.\u201d\u201cHmm hmph, that\u2019s not it, Mama has been able to carry Mengmeng.\u201dThe little princess was dancing in Mama\u2019s arms.Zhou Fei thought for a moment, then followed along. Zhang Li and Zhao Feng stayed on the first floor.\u201cBro, when did you settle it for Sister-in-law?\u201d How come I\u2019ve never heard of you have dealings with her? \u201d Zhang Li was extremely curious about this matter.When Zhang Li knew Mengmeng, she could estimate that Zi Yan was pregnant when her families were separated. At that time, Zhang Han was also like the sun in the sky as well, and he always had the appearance of a scammer. If he was together with Zi Yan at that time, with his personality, he would definitely take Zi Yan on tour around Shang Jing.\u201cYa!\u201dZhang Li suddenly called out softly. She remembered, at that time, Zhang Han and Qiao Luoluo were probably still male and female friends, so Zhang Li stared: \u201cBrother, you were with Qiao Luoluo then, was it that you and Zi Yan secretly\u2026? Did you step on two boats? \u201dWhen she said these words, Zhao Feng was startled, and even his ears pricked up, as he looked carefully at the scene before him. Although he felt that he might be gossiping a little, he was truly very curious about Zhang Han\u2019s situation.\u201cNope.\u201dZhang Han didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, and said \u201cIt is just an incident\u201d.\u201cHumph!\u201d Brother, you just lie to me. What incident can bring you to bed? What incident can produce a child? \u201d Zhang Li said with a light snort.Zhang Han shook his head while smiling, and said: \u201cIt\u2019s the same time that I was beat by Zheng Qiang up.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Zhang Li glared and said: \u201cYou beat him because of a sister-in-law?\u201d\u201cYes, I drank too much that time \u2026\u201d Zhang Han gave a simple explanation.At the same time, he thought back to that time.Zi Yan had been extremely popular back then, and she had the opportunity to be the Queen of Shadows in the next year. That time when Zi Yan came to the Shang Jing, she was introduced by a high ranking official of the SARFT and had a collaboration with Zheng Qiang\u2019s broad sense of the group.Zheng Qiang was the chairman of the Guang Ming Group. He was only thirty years old, and was also a direct descendant of the Zheng Family of the Shang Jing. He was in a high position, and according to his identity, he was slightly higher than Zhang Han at the time.However, Zheng Qiang was also a decisive person. He had thought of Zi Yan for more than a year, and during their cooperation, he finally found a chance to add a few extra things to Zi Yan\u2019s wine, making Zi Yan\u2019s mind a mess.As for Zhang Han, who had just broken up with Qiao Luoluo, he was quite angry in his heart as well. Breaking up in that kind of manner could also be considered a blow to Zhang Han.That time at the higher end of Shang Jing\u2019s Clear Sky Entertainment Club, Zhang Han drank a lot and blurrily walked into the wrong room. He saw the struggling Zi Yan and Zheng Qiang\u2019s hideous face.Furious, Zhang Han picked up the wine bottle and slapped Zheng Qiang\u2019s head hard, immediately making him unconscious. He picked up Zi Yan and left the clubhouse, ordering a presidential suite in a nearby hotel.Zi yan was unconscious during that period, she even wanted to take off the clothes. Although Zhang Han liked beauty, he also had a sense of propriety, and held onto Zi Yan\u2019s hand tightly along the way.In his room at the hotel, Zhang Han felt even more confused after getting drunk, and Zi Yan was even more confused than him.Just as Zhang Han wanted to leave, Zi Yan\u2019s tender white palm grabbed Zhang Han\u2019s hand and pulled him back onto the bed, allowing Zhang Han to fall down.An entire night had passed \u2026Although Zhang Han was initially drunk, he could still vaguely remember the charming scene from that night. He still had some impression of Zi Yan\u2019s graceful figure.Recalling the scenes from the morning of the second day, Zhang Han could not help but chuckle twice.But these words were all just thinking in his heart; Zhang Han did not explain it to Zhang Li; he only said that he saved Zi Yan from Zheng Qiang.\u201cSo the boss was the hero who saved the beauty back then.\u201d Zhao Feng said with a light smile.This kind of hero saving a beauty sounded like a very beautiful story.\u201cA hero saving a beauty is also something worth being proud of. If it wasn\u2019t for my brother being the marshal, how could they be together?\u201d Zhang Li curled her lips.In her opinion, there was a condition for a hero to save a beauty, and that condition was that a man should be a bit more handsome.\u201cYou\u2019re right; the boss is indeed handsome.\u201d Zhao Feng replied.While talking, Liang Mengqi and the other two quickly walked in. Seeing Zhao Feng sitting at the dining table and chatting with Zhang Han, Liang Mengqi smiled and said:\u201cEh? Zhao Feng, you came very early. \u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t leave this morning.\u201d Zhao Feng replied.\u201cOh.\u201d Liang Mengqi nodded.Zhao Dahu and Yu Qingqing also greeted Zhang Han and then sat at their usual table.\u201cTime to cook.\u201dZhang Han looked at the time. 11: 40 AM. He then got up and walked towards the kitchen to prepare today\u2019s lunch.The first thing he did was to cook the rice. Normally, the water used to cook the rice was also from Mount New Moon\u2019s spirit water.Of course, the Mount New Moon\u2019s wheat and rice were equal in status, so it would be extraordinary to grow under the same environment as the Mount New Moon.At the same time that they cooked the rice, Zhang Han beat up the eggs. In the current Egg-Fried Rice, almost thirty of them had to be fried in a single meal, causing the number of eggs stored to decrease.Originally, Zhang Han had planned to sell less food when his eggs were almost consumed, but he didn\u2019t need to worry too much about Mount New Moon\u2019s current situation.Pure yang water still had some reserves and was about 20 liters left. It was enough for him to buy some adult hens, cattle, sheep, pigs, and so on to feed Pure YangWater.After he was done, Zhang Han started to sort out a few large potatoes.The potatoes were round and plump. Under normal circumstances, some of the potatoes sold outside would have some concave spots, which were not very neat, but the Mount New Moon potatoes were round and like a shot ball.Zhang Han took out his paring knife and quickly waved it.Shua shua shua.The potato skin quickly left its body.In the dining hall, not only was the food extremely delicious, even Zhang Han\u2019s cooking process was extremely beautiful, and the rate of viewing the dishes was extremely high.After he finished preparing the potatoes, he began preparing the chopped green onion and other supplementary ingredients.By the time they finished their preparations, it was already midnight. The customers came one after another, and the table beside the window had already been filled with six people.However, this time, the six of them were all staff from the neighboring restaurant. After tasting the dishes, they were unable to extricate themselves and would always come over for lunch.\u201cBoss, what food we have to eat today?\u201d Liang Mengqi\u2019s eyes lit up when she saw that Zhang Han had prepared potatoes and cucumbers.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Han nodded.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Yu Qingqing quickly asked.\u201cTofu and cucumber.\u201d Zhang Han replied.Liked it?

    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - Noodle soupPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cFlavor cold dish?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Yu Qingqing said happily. She loved these side dishes very much.Zhang Han had specially prepared these two cold dish, because they wanted to eat noodles at noon, With cold dish, it could be said to be a perfect match.Potato filament is a famous flavor dish in Zhejiang province, which belongs to Zhejiang province.The procedure is very simple. Cut the potatoes into shreds, put the shredded potatoes into clear water, to prevent the potatoes from rusting and discoloration. Make the potatoes\u2019 silk fly water clear and cooked, reserve the red and green peppers, cut the shredded potatoes into pieces. Cool them with cold water, add the red and green peppers. Put in a teaspoon of pepper oil, a teaspoon of chili oil, a little salt, a little MSG, a little sesame oil, add with a little vinegar, then mix them according to personal taste.It was just the usualprocedure, but in this restaurant, there was a king of seasonings \u2014 \u2014 fragrant wood. No matter what dish it was, as long as the fragrant wood was sprinkled, the fragrance would make one\u2019s mouth water.The other one was a cucumber shot. It was also a very common household dish, so the recipe was even simpler.The main ingredient was cucumber, which was made with various seasonings.It was cool and refreshing, suitable for summer. The cucumber was cold, eating in summer could clear heat and remove fire, eliminate toxins from the body; and it also had beauty effect. Furthermore, eating cucumber in summer with delicious taste could also help digestion.Slapping cucumber has the effect of opening up the stomach. In addition to low calorie, cucumber can remove dampness, heat and detoxification; its dietary fiber has the effect of promoting the excretion of toxic substances and lowering cholesterol. In fresh cucumber, propanedioic acid, which inhibits the conversion of sugar to fat, has the function of weight loss.Of course, if one were to describe the effects on the market, they would not mention the effects.If it were only that kind of pure green food, then it would be fine. Furthermore, not only was the green food nutritious, but their effects were also very good. This was what people usually called nourishing food.And for crops grown in the Mount New Moon, this nourishment would increase by two times. It could be said that eating New Moon Bay\u2019s food all year round would greatly improve one\u2019s physical health.At present, the people in the big city were all living in a \u2018hot water environment\u2019, where day and night were reversed, and their bodies were in a sub healthy state. The hospital was becoming more and more popular. However, life was like this; the times had progressed; no one could change anything, so eating a little bit more pure green, healthy food was also a very good choice.Otherwise, the food on the market would not be of all kinds. Pure green food would be more expensive. The good food from the production area would be called special food, which would be called private use.Back to the main topic, there were more and more people lining up outside the restaurant at noon.It could be said that after several days of brewing, Mengmeng\u2019s casual restaurant already had a bit of fame in this street. As long as one wasn\u2019t blind, they could see it from nearby.\u201cHuh?\u201dSuddenly, a blonde foreign friend who was casually walking on the street made a sound of surprise and walked towards the restaurant.He first observed the area outside the dining room. From the clean and bright floor-to-ceiling windows, he could see that the interior was neatly decorated.\u201cIt looks pretty good. Let\u2019s try it out here at noon.\u201dThe golden-haired man mumbled in English and walked to the place where the customers lined up. He looked at the people beside him and smiled. He asked in Chinese with a curled lips, \u201cHello, is this restaurant great?\u201d\u201cMore than great? Let me tell you, this restaurant is the best restaurant I\u2019ve had since I was a kid! Beyond anyone else!\u201d The man beside him replied solemnly.\u201cIs it really that powerful?\u201d The golden-haired man\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cOf course.\u201d When a young girl at the back saw her foreign brother was very handsome, she smiled and said, \u201cHe\u2019s not exaggerating at all. This is the best meal I\u2019ve had since I was young. It\u2019s super delicious. You would feel sorry if you didn\u2019t taste it.\u201dThe blond man smiled and said, \u201cThen what are the specialties of the delicacies here?\u201d\u201cEgg Fried Rice.\u201d\u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cEgg Fried Rice.\u201d\u201cIs there nothing else?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOh, oh, that\u2019s good. What is the specialty of the delicacy?\u201d\u201cEgg Fried Rice.\u201d\u201cPuff \u2026\u201d\u201cThis foreign brother.\u201d Finally, the young man next to the blond man patted his arm and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of delicious food here, but you won\u2019t be able to eat it. We can only try the Egg Fried Rice.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d The golden-haired man asked in confusion.\u201cDo you recognize Chinese characters?\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d The golden-haired man nodded.\u201cThen take a look at the notice board over there and you\u2019ll know why.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d The golden-haired man nodded and walked to the side of the door. He looked at the notice board very seriously and muttered:\u201cBusiness hours?\u201d Only three hours? Three hundred yuan for each serving of Egg Fried Rice and a hundred yuan for each serving of milk? Do other dishes have to be tasted by members? \u201cOh my god!\u201dWhen he saw the information below, he suddenly exclaimed in shock and could not believe his eyes.A membership card for a million yuan per card? And it was even the top ten, followed by ten million membership cards? Heavens, how could a ten million membership card be possible?At this moment, he was completely dumbfounded, and he didn\u2019t know what was going on.He returned to his seat in a daze. Seeing his expression, the crowd couldn\u2019t help but let out satisfied smiles.This was completely within reason. When they had first seen this news, their stunned expressions hadn\u2019t been any less than his.After a while, the blond man came back to his senses. He had a complicated expression on his face as he took out his cell phone from his pocket and gave the restaurant a sign. He then opened his notebook and wrote:Mengmeng\u2019s casual restaurant, XXX XX Street, XX Year XX At noon record:It was a very special restaurant, there were tens of people lining up at the door; it was a bustling business. The restaurant had a membership system, from one to ten, each membership card costed 1 million, number 11 to 20, 10 million each; it was inconceivable, the nonmember temporarily only had Egg-Fried Rice and Milk, Egg-Fried Rice was 300 yuan per serving, milk was 100 yuan per cup. The price was slightly higher.After recording all of this, the golden-haired man put away his phone and waited silently for the crowd to line up.In the dining hall, when the food was about to be cooked, Zhang Han took out the big pot, which was filled with spirit water that were poured into the Mount New Moon, and placed it on the stove to boil the water.Seeing this, Liang Mengqi\u2019s eyes lit up, and hurriedly asked: Boss, do we have new delicacies?\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cNoodle soup.\u201d\u201cThe noodle soup? \u201cThat\u2019s fine too. I\u2019ll try it later.\u201d Liang Mengqi said in a slightly disappointed tone.She had eaten noodle soup a few times, but in the end, it was really just noodle soup, just like how it passed the water surface. She didn\u2019t have any experience with taste buds at all, and after that, Liang Mengqi had never eaten a noodle soup again.However, she still looked forward to what Zhang Han had cooked. After all, there had never been a time when the boss\u2019s food tasted bad.On the other hand, the eyes of Yu Qingqing and Zhao Dahu, who were standing in front of him, lit up.Zhao Feng, who was at the side, shook his head slightly. He knew that if he wanted to eat something good, he had to get on good terms with the owner.In the morning, he had heard from Zhang Li that they had eaten chicken last night, and the fragrance that was described by them made Zhao Feng drool uncontrollably. Now that Zhao Feng had seen Yu Qingqing and the others like this, if he were to say it out loud, he would probably spoil their appetite.Noodle soup were food that Zhang Han decided to prepare after considering it. It was simple and tasty, but the key thing was that the quality of the Mount New Moon\u2019s noodles was good, and it could completely explain the true meaning of noodle soup.Noodle soup were Chinese noodles snacks. As the name implied, it was basically not flavorings, especially those that were colored. For example, soy sauce, cooking wine, meat broth, red oil, etc.The noodle soup was its original flavour, embodying the pure fragrance of the noodle soup. The pure white noodles and clear soup with a few side dishes made it taste light and refreshing.There were a few procedures for cooking the noodle soup. The noodle soup, the sliced noodle soup, and the noodle soup were all quite complicated. Experienced people and inexperienced people used the same noodle soup to make the noodle soup.Sometimes, in order to ensure the strength of the noodles, a scientific proportion of salt water was added. The salt water and the noodles would increase the strength of the dough, making it easier to pull the noodles, so that there would not be a situation where the dough was broken or too thick.But Zhang Han didn\u2019t need it at all. With Mount New Moon\u2019s spirit water here, why need anything like salt water?Zhang Han prepared the dough.There was a lot of knowledge in kneading dough, but it was not always possible to fill up the bowl of water at once. One could dig a pit in the middle of the flour and slowly pour the water into it, stirring it slowly with chopsticks.When the water is sucked dry by the flour, knead the flour repeatedly with your hands so that the flour becomes many small pieces of flour, commonly known as \u201csnowflake noodles\u201d.In this way, the flour will not be too late to absorb and spread everywhere, or stick full of paste, and then sprinkle water on the \u201csnowflake\u201d, hand stirring, so that it becomes a ball of small dough, called \u201cgrape noodles\u201d.At this time, the flour has not absorbed enough moisture and its hardness is quite large. The flour can be compressed into a piece, and the paste on the basin or panel can be wiped off forcefully. Then, the flour on the \u201cgrape flour\u201d can be washed and sprinkled on the \u201cgrape flour\u201d so that the grape flour can be kneaded into a smooth flour fungus with both hands. This kind of blending method is called \u201cthree steps of adding water\u201d, which can make the whole blending process clean, flexible, and achieve the effect of \u201cdough light, basin light, hand light\u201d.When Zhang Han was kneading the dough, the spirit energy in his body was flowing into his hands, making the kneading process much more efficient. If it were another person, then he would have taken 8 or 10 minutes to mend the noodles, but Zhang Han only took two minutes.Now that the noodles were ready, the boiling water was almost boiling. At this time, the second step was to cut the noodles.Just as Zhang Han was about to pick up the blade, he thought for a moment and then retracted his hand.\u201cBoss, the way you knead dough is so cool.\u201dAt this time, Liang Mengqi came over. She didn\u2019t really feel it before, but now she felt that a man who could cook was really handsome. No, it should be that the owner was really handsome.After all, no one could cook such a delicious meal except their boss.\u201cBoss\u2019s handmade noodles will definitely smell good.\u201d Liang Mengqi pressed her hands on the counter, her eyes brimming with vitality as she watched Zhang Han\u2019s actions.Liked it?
