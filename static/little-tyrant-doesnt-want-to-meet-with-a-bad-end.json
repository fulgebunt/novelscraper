She\u2019ll be your little sister from now on, Roel.\u201dIn a lavishly decorated room stood a handsome yet frail-looking middle-aged man. He held onto the hand of a silver-haired girl as he introduced her to a well-dressed, black-haired boy standing before him.The middle-aged man was known as Carter Ascart, a marquess of the Saint Mesit Theocracy. He served as the Chief Magician of the Holy Paladin Order, as well as the head of the Ascart House. He was also the father of Roel Ascart, the stunned 9-year-old boy standing before him at this very instant.Roel Ascart was the sole son of this noble family. He had dignified facial features and a head of slightly long black hair. Standing at just under 1.5 meters tall, he was considered to be on the shorter end, especially among the nobles of this country. His skinny physique also revealed his lack of physical training. However, the noble education that he had undergone from a young age gave him a composed and quiet disposition, which gave most people a fairly good first impression of him.This, however, was nothing but an empty facade.In truth, Roel was infamous as a little tyrant. Young as he was, he had a long list of misdeeds to his name. Even the servants of the marquess\u2019 house would pale whenever his name was mentioned.And it was such a little tyrant that was currently staring at the little girl who was soon going to become his stepsister. The golden eyes that he had inherited from his mother had narrowed tightly, and his complexion looked awful. His body was as stiff as the sculpture standing tall\u00a0 above the water fountain in his family\u2019s garden.\u201cRoel, what are you doing? You\u2019re scaring her!\u201dNoticing Alicia cowering behind him with a frightened expression under the pressure from Roel\u2019s intense gaze, the middle-aged man howled at this troublemaker of a son of his.Your looks are your only redeeming feature, and even they\u2019re ruined when you act like such an arrogant little villain!Do you have to behave in such a manner?I know that Alicia is beautiful, but you\u2019re the son of a marquess. Where in the Lord\u2019s name have the manners your etiquette teacher taught you gone to?Carter Ascart was clearly embarrassed by his son\u2019s behaviour. He raised his hand with an intent to give his son a whopping, but barely after he raised his hand, the image of his deceased wife flashed across his mind. After a short moment of hesitation, he eventually put down his hand with a deep sigh.\u201cCough cough. Alicia, it would appear that your brother Roel is exhausted. I shouldn\u2019t have put him through so much magic training earlier.\u201dAs Marquess Carter put down his pride to help clear up the situation for his darned son, he discreetly gestured to the maids by the side. The sharp-witted maids immediately stepped forth and brought Roel back to his room to rest.It was then that Roel finally heard the strained voice of a little girl behind him.\u201cI-I\u2019m alright. It\u2019s not father\u2019s fault\u2026\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Roel Ascart was really doubting his life at the moment.It was because he had transmigrated to this world. Or to be more exact, he had just remembered the memories of his previous life.Roel, a heterosexual male, had been a twenty-year-old university student from Earth. He was born to an average family, and he didn\u2019t have any extraordinary experiences in romance either. To summarize, he was an ordinary person. If one had to point out something that was different about him, it would be that he was practically a NEET. He liked to spend his time reading novels and playing otaku-esque games.Cough cough, you get it.This perfectly ordinary person was unfortunate enough to have gotten into a traffic accident. Before he knew it, he was already a member of the army of transmigrators from Earth.He found himself transmigrating into a place known as the Saint Mesit Theocracy, one of the Three Great Powers, becoming the sole son of the long-standing noble lineage of the Ascart House. He had become the successor to a marquess\u2019 house, a real blue blood.Had he not known anything at all, Roel would have been delighted to be born into an aristocratic, land-owning family in his second life. He would have had endless money to squander, and he would have been able to do whatever he wanted to. But that wasifhe really knew nothing at all.\u201cThe Xykelite House\u2026 exists.\u201d\u201cSorofya\u2026 is a real person here too!\u201d\u201cLucas Ackermann \u2013 If this man really exists as well\u2026\u201dBam!A heavy book fell to the ground, ringing the final death knell in Roel\u2019s heart.\u201cHe exists as well\u2026 Hahaha\u2026 It\u2019s over. My life is over!\u201dThe black-haired boy inside the study room grabbed his head in disbelief as his blood pressure rocketed through the roof. He felt light-headed, as if there was a blood clot in his head.\u201cJust what kind of hellish abyss did I land myself into?\u201dAfter comparing the information in his memories to the records of this world, Roel was certain that he had entered the world of a gal game he had played in his previous world\u2026 and to make things worse, he was actually the villain here!The name of the game wasEyes of the Chronicler, and it was a rather atypical gal game of epic proportions, with a gigantic and well-detailed world and a grandiose storyline. It also boasted many romantic interests that one could aim for. The illustrations were also lovely. If one really had to point out a problem with the game\u2026 it was just not popular.There were many reasons that one could cite for its lack of popularity, but Roel felt that it could all be summarized into two points. First, it was rated as PG. Second, its plot often proceeded in a sketchy manner.The game\u2019s mechanics were extremely bizarre, proceeding in units of \u2018years\u2019. It would still have been fine if that was all, but the storyline kept jumping all around the place too. Wars literally broke out at the click of a button, and crucial characters could actually die in the midst of these wars, including the female capture targets!Roel\u2019s evaluation of this game was that it was outlandishly eccentric. It was as if the scriptwriter was really just a historical chronicler with extremely limited information. The player was given just the broad strokes of events, and they were left to fill in all the missing blanks.The only reason why Roel was able to bring himself to continue playing this game was because he had an attachment to this incredibly handsome villain that shared his name, making it easier for him to immerse himself into the world. Not to mention, the female characters were absolutely gorgeous!It was for this reason that he recognized the little girl the moment he saw her a little earlier.Alicia Ascart.The Silverash Child, the possessor of the legendary Silver Bloodline, the Silver Moon of the Saint Mesit Theocracy. Her beauty was often compared to both the untouchable crystal ice that formed at the highest peaks of the harshest mountains once a century, as well as the searing blade of the legendary sword of the Knight Kingdom Pendor. Her body had a perfect harmony of features, as if it was put together by the hands of a god. Her valiant crimson eyes would not have been out of place on the faces of the heroes of the grand epics.She was cold and lofty on the outside, but her heart was tender and fragile.Of course, that was all in the future, when she finally matured to become the female capture target in the game. As for now\u2026 she was just a little 7-year-old brat.Roel, as her 9-year-old older brother, found himself in a very tempting position.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs the sages often said, age is not a problem. A two-year age gap didn\u2019t pose a problem to Roel at all. If he hadn\u2019t known better, he would have rushed straight to the side of the angel who had yet to unfurl her wings and struck up a friendly relationship with her right away.Unfortunately, he knew better, and that was why he was afraid.He wasn\u2019t rendered speechless earlier on just because he had remembered the memories of his previous life; rather, it was out of fright.Ten years later, the frail little girl whom his father was protecting earlier, Alicia Ascart, would kill her stepbrother, Roel Ascart.In cold blood, without a hint of mercy.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 - I Should At Least Die A Knowing DeathPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2: I Should At Least Die A Knowing DeathEyes of the Chroniclerwas a strategy-based gal game with a fairly complicated storyline. There were 4 main capture targets, and just like most gal games, it would start off with a common route before diverging into the independent routes of the chosen capture target in the later stage of the game.The excessive number of events and frequent time skips in the game crammed players with an overload of information, creating a poor user experience. On top of that, the multitude of routes that led to bad ends, as well as the lack of satisfying eroticism within the game, left frustrated players dying to bang their heads against walls.Putting all of this aside though, there were still some strengths to the game.The illustrations of major characters were amazing, and the background and storyline of characters were also quite detailed.The main character of the game was a fellow named Paul Ackermann. A prince carrying the bloodline of the Austine Empire, he went missing in the streets when he was still a child, and it was only when he was sixteen that the royal intelligence network managed to find him. He was swiftly brought back to the royal palace to be inaugurated as a prince of the empire.As fantastic as being a prince of the empire might have sounded, the reality of it was less enviable due to the two older brothers that Paul had. Having grown up in the streets, his lack of knowledge and etiquette swiftly led to him being ostracized by the factions led by the other two princes. Eventually, Paul was eventually sent off to the Country of Academics Brolne to study.The common route of the game started off with the main character arriving at the Country of Academics Brolne. He would soon meet numerous gorgeous young ladies here, embarking on an adventurous journey of heart-throbbing romance. Once a female capture target was selected\u2014this was also the point when the player finally went down a specific independent route\u2014the main character, with his knowledge, fighting skills, and the aid of his girlfriend, would return back to his country to participate in the factional wars. In the end, he would overcome his two older brothers to take the crown for himself.To summarize, it was a \u2018from academy to vying for supremacy in the royal court\u2019 plotline.Of the four capture targets that the main character would meet, one of them was Alicia Ascart.Alicia Ascart was a spy that the Theocracy sent to Paul\u2019s side, and her route was known for being hard to clear. Due to her beautiful appearance that appealed to the aesthetics of the players, she was often ranked amongst the top three in character popularity polls. She could be considered as the billboard of the game, which was also the reason why Roel remembered her clearly.And what he remembered even more clearly was the CG depicting how Alicia slit the neck of the villain Roel Ascart.Indeed, Roel Ascart was no other than the boss of the Middle School Arc inEyes of the Chronicler!In that arc, the main character and his harem would unravel the schemes of Roel Ascart before uniting together to lynch him to death. At the end of the battle, the main character would then choose a capture target and embark on the independent route.In the storyline, even though Alicia was the stepsister of Roel, she hated Roel deeply due to having suffered greatly from his oppression. In the final battle, with the creed of \u2018An eye for an eye\u2019, she sliced off his head decisively with a single slash.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe adorable black-haired boy sat on a high Robinia wood chair and he stared at the edge of the table in front of him earnestly, contemplating a matter seriously\u2026Is it too late for me to change characters if I bash my head on the corner of the table right now?Roel touched his forehead as a slight frown slowly formed on his youthful face. He really felt like bawling out his eyes right now!Isn\u2019t the world just screwing with me over here? It\u2019s one thing for you to not transmigrate me into the position of the main character, but you even made me a villain in the common route? Could things get worse than this?What am I supposed to do? My stepsister has already come knocking on my door; it won\u2019t be long before she comes chasing after me with a chopper in hand!\u201cC-calm down. It\u2019s especially at times like this that I have to calm down!\u201dRoel took in deep breaths as he tried to use his maturity as an adult to suppress his emotions.One shouldn\u2019t panic in the face of trouble because panicking never works.Repeating this quote again and again in his mind to brainwash himself, Roel finally felt himself calming down a little. He rubbed his own cheeks to wake himself up before beginning to rack his mind to find a way out of the quandary he was in.As the saying goes, every effect comes with a cause. Love and hatred don\u2019t just appear out of nowhere. Given so, why would Alicia Ascart, the Silverash Child, hate someone whom she had only met once thus far?Roel began searching through his memories for the storyline of the game. He recalled that there were indeed a few conversations that revealed the reason why she hated Roel, even though they were mostly quick mentions.After a long moment of contemplation, Roel summarized it all into three points.First and foremost, Roel had bullied Alicia from a young age. Due to his father doting on him excessively, he had been able to do as he pleased, and he exploited this authority to make Alicia\u2019s life unbearable.Secondly, prior to being adopted into the Ascart House, Alicia was the sole daughter of a baron family. That baron had died in a battle while protecting Roel\u2019s father.Thirdly, when the Ascart House fell from grace, Roel once gave away Alicia as a chip in exchange for certain benefits. While there was no additional details regarding that in the game, judging just by Alicia\u2019s ravishing appearance\u2026\u201cTsk, this Roel must have something wrong with his head! Did he get his head jammed between the cracks of a door while he was younger? How nice would it be to have such a beautiful little sister to dote on? Why in the world would he bully her and even give her away? Do you know how frightening she becomes later in the game? She\u2019s the Silverash Child, renowned to be invincible under the moon!\u201dRoel grasped his head speechlessly as he was rendered utterly dumbfounded by the suicidal tendencies of the other Roel.He began to rank the three reasons by order of importance. The second reason appeared to be of secondary importance right now. What was the most important was the third reason!Looking at these reasons in terms of their difficulty to resolve, the first reason was still rather easy to deal with. All Roel had to do was to not bully her. The second one was impossible to deal with anymore since he couldn\u2019t change what had already happened. The third one, however, appeared to be problematic.\u201cMy family will fall from grace? Why?\u201dThe little boy stared at the third reason he had written on a sheet of paper in a daze. Recalling the storyline, the Ascart House did appear to have declined ten years later. It was also during that period of time that Roel, despite being the son of a marquess, resorted to becoming a believer of a demonic cult, eventually becoming one of the major villains.Roel raised his head and took a look around the elegant study room around him.A tuliptree from Gran Fiefdom, leather parchments from the Earssen Highlands, the most popular glass cupboards amongst the nobles of the Holy Capital, and an incense that was literally worth gold burning quietly in the background. Taking a whiff of the extravagance surrounding him, he felt his spirits lifting back up.For such a family to fall into decline? You must be kidding me!However, the game wouldn\u2019t lie. The Ascart House had indeed fallen from grace within the game, so Roel had no choice but to believe it no matter how unthinkable it was to him. What he had to do now was find a way to prevent it all from happening.The little boy seated before the study desk crossed his small arms and fell into deep thoughts. The knit on his forehead grew tighter and tighter, and he found himself falling deeper and deeper into despair.Nothing came to mind at all!Roel couldn\u2019t think of anything he could do to prevent the decline of his family.In the first place, this event wasn\u2019t covered in detail within the game. Without the advantage of foresight that other transmigrators had, what could he possibly do as a 9-year-old brat? He was not like Alicia! Other than his devilishly good looks, he was nothing more than an ordinary brat!What to do? Am I to await my doom just like this?Fear encroached on Roel like a shadow, leaving him feeling utterly frightened. It was then that a crisp bell sounded in his mind.\u3010Ding!\u3011\u3010System initializing\u2026\u3011Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As expected of his System, it was tailored right down to his needs! He was still thinking that there was no way to save the Ascart House when his System delivered what he needed right into his hands.

In the end, he could only sigh deeply and admit to the fact that he was indeed a weakling.A Magician Apprentice when he was already 9-year-old? Who in the world would believe that his father was the Chief Magician of the Holy Knight Order?!The little boy clutched his forehead as he lamented the lackadaisical life he had lived prior to recalling his memories. Shaking his head, he decided to try out his two Fundamental Spells first.Minor Heatwave allowed him to produce a slight gust of warmer wind, creating an effect reminiscent to that of a hairdryer. As for Phantom Hands, it was a spell that granted one the ability of telekinesis. As for why there was the additional tag of (Defective) behind it\u2026\u201c\u2026\u201dRoel looked at the invisible hand floating before him, which had nothing but its middle finger, and he suddenly felt like he had been grievously humiliated.2 replies\u00a0\u2013 3 hours agoForget it, none of this is important. As long as I have the help of the System, I\u2019ll surely be able to rise up against all odds! Let me see what is there in the Exchange Shop first\u2026Roel calmed himself down before turning his attention back onto the System.\u3010Affection Point Exchange ShopYou can collect the affection that sentient beings have toward you in your vicinity and convert them into points. These points can be used to purchase facilities and items that will aid you in the resurgence of your noble house. The types of affection include kinship, friendship, romance, respect, infatuation, and such. The items that have been exchanged cannot be refunded.\u3011\u3010Gold Coin ShopYou can use the wealth that you have accumulated in reality to purchase personal goods that include combat-related items, daily life necessities, occupational tools, and such.

The user is advised to pay careful attention to the two shops.\u3011\u201cHm? Special discounts? Wow, it seems quite friendly\u2026 but is that all?\u201dRoel inspected every nook and cranny of the two shops, but he wasn\u2019t able to find anything else at all.\u201cHold it for a second, this isn\u2019t right. Isn\u2019t a System supposed to give out quests for the main storyline with rewards on the line? I mean, even a minor quest would do too! Like killing slimes at the village entrance for a short dagger, or finding a missing cat for potions\u2026 Isn\u2019t that the norm for Systems?\u201d\u3010The House Resurgence System is a passive system. The user is advised to live life passionately and strive to be independent. This System strongly objects to the act of holding the user hostage to its whims and orders the user around like a tool. As the saying goes, a man should constantly seek to improve himself on his own accord. \u3011\u201c???\u201dWhat just happened? Did I just get taught a life lesson by a system?Moreover, there are actually passive systems nowadays too? Wow, the variety sure has expanded fast!The shocked Roel took a look at his Iron Bloodline and Magician Apprentice tier on his User Interface before retorting, \u201cBoss, my head is on the guillotine.

He began looking through the list one by one.Nine-headed Serpent Staff, Raphaen\u2019s Fingernail Book, Bec\u2019s Skull, Primitive Stone of Terror\u2026 Holy shit, what the hell are all of these? Wait a moment\u2026 Bronze Bloodline!There was one item at the very end of the list that made Roel open his mouth wide in shock. He quickly focused his attention and took a closer look at it.\u3010Blood Servant of Raphaen(Lower Bronze Bloodline)A bloodline created by Great Warlock Raphaen to prolong his longevity after he descended into lunacy. His cruel experiments have led to the death of thousands of innocent civilians, invoking the rage of the populace on the continent. He eventually lost his life to a crusade against him. However, before his death, he managed to create a nigh indestructible bloodline of the nightmares. Rumors have it that some of the unfortunate civilians who have been experimented on by him still loiter around their graves to this day.Bloodline Effect: Swift RegenerationSide Effect: Sanity CorrosionPrice: 10,000 Gold Coins\u3011\u201cSanity Corrosion? W-who in the world would dare to use something like this? Besides\u2026 this is too expensive!\u201dRoel\u2019s handsome face twitched upon seeing the description of the item.10,000 gold coins! What did that mean?\u201cEven as the son of a marquess, I only receive 10 gold coins as pocket money every month! For an ordinary family, as long as they scrimped and saved, 28 gold coins would be roughly enough for them to last a year! How is it that your Lower Bronze Bloodline costs a whopping 10,000 gold coins? Not to mention, it\u2019s still an inferior good that can turn a person into a fool\u2026\u201d\u3010Blloodline enhancement is a highly difficult feat. The System\u2019s price is fair and impartial. With great power comes great cost. May the user think it through carefully and purchase with caution.\u3011\u201cWhy is it that Alicia\u2019s Silverash Child Bloodline has no side effects then?\u201d\u3010The user should be informed that the top bloodlines of each tier suffer from minimal or no side effects.\u3011\u201c\u2026\u201dFine, I get it. Alicia is all great and mighty. I\u2019ll admit it, alright?\u201cBut no matter what, it\u2019s still too expensive. I\u2019m just a nine-year-old! Where am I to find that much money?\u201d\u3010The user is advised to take a look at the Affection Point Exchange Shop to obtain tools that would improve the Ascart House\u2019s revenue before using the money earned to improve himself. The user\u2019s strength will be essential in leading the Ascart House to a bright future. Only through forming such a virtuous cycle will the user be able to overcome his death flags and enjoy a fulfilling life.\u30111 reply\u00a0\u2013 2 hours ago\u201cI see. I\u2019ll take a look at the Affection Point Exchange Shop then.\u201dRoel was persuaded by the long speech made by the System, so he decided to take a look at the Affection Point Exchange System first.

The user is advised to quickly equip it.\u3011Right after the System said those words, bits of light began gleaming from Roel\u2019s hand. It looked similar to how the fireflies of the Ascart Fiefdom would usually frolic in his hands during the past summer nights. By the time the little boy returned to his senses, the light had already formed a small emblem on his palm.\u201cIs this\u2026 the key to change my fate?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe adorable black-haired boy muttered to himself as he grasped the emblem in his hand tightly.

However, due to his recollection of his past memories, Roel had already ruined their first meeting.Ey! What a huge regret! Why did I react so slowly back then? With my looks, even if I can\u2019t charm her over right away, I would have at least been able to leave her with a favorable impression of me!Roel examined the black-haired, gold-eyed boy reflected in the glass before him before squeezing his slightly chubby but attractive face. Once again, he affirmed himself.Yeap, I\u2019m good-looking.And judging from the game\u2019s character illustrations, my dad and mum\u2019s genes are still quite stable. I\u2019ll continue to grow more and more handsome with time.Maybe it\u2019s my delusion at work, but after wearing this emblem, I feel like I look a little more\u2026 pleasing?The little boy poked at the silver emblem on his chest with his finger as he built up his confidence for the battle he was going to fight later on.He might not have left a good first impression on Alicia, but there was still a chance to salvage the situation. With this item aiding him, he would make sure to brush up Alicia\u2019s affection for him and destroy the death flag in its cradle!But first and foremost, Roel felt that he should find someone to try his hand first.\u201cAnna, you must have waited a long while for me. Are you tired?\u201dThe door to the study room opened, and an adorable little boy leaped right into the embrace of the maid standing by the doorway, looking up at her with big, round eyes.\u201cYoung master? What\u2019s wrong?\u201dThe maid that was assigned to take care of Roel\u2019s daily needs stared at the little boy holding onto her leg in shock. She was baffled by her young master\u2019s sudden act of intimacy.Roel Ascart was rather notorious for his spiteful mischief. Due to him having lost her mother at a young age, his father, Marquess Carter, doted on him excessively, not bearing to hit or scold him in the least. He viewed it as a way to make up for Roel\u2019s loss in maternal love.Such an environment proved to be ideal in cultivating the stereotypical arrogant young master, as could be seen from the 9-year-old Roel. He was smart enough to rein himself in before his father and the other nobles, but those who interacted with him on a day-to-day basis knew deep well that there was another side to him\u2014how could they not know when they were victims of his malice themselves?None of the servants of the Ascart House dared to speak of this matter aloud, but they were deeply unnerved by the fact that this little tyrant would one day become their master and even the head of this fiefdom.Anna, especially, was planning to retire before this tyrant grows up out of consideration for her own safety.As such, it was imaginable that it would cause bouts of uneasiness when such a notorious tyrant suddenly changed his attitude. Was this just a spontaneous action, or was there a deeper, more nefarious plot behind this?As a professional, Anna maintained a smile on her lips while her heart thumped in wariness.On the other hand, Roel continued carrying out his plan.\u201cA-ah, it\u2019s nothing much! I was just reading a storybook, and it says that children like me will be gobbled up by the werewolves in the Charon Forest. I don\u2019t want to be eaten up, uwah\u2014\u2014\u201dThe black-haired boy spoke with a lump in his throat. His face was scrunched up in fear, and his tears were falling on the ground like raindrops, unable to be dried no matter how he wiped them with his hands.Such a sight gave Anna the scare of her life. She quickly kneeled down to wipe away little Roel\u2019s tears.\u201cYoung master, it\u2019ll be alright. Those are just lies,\u201d explained Anna with a helpless tone, as she recalled the \u2018Ruminating Incense\u2019 burning in the study room. \u201cIt must be the effects of the magic item that the old master uses to keep himself awake. You don\u2019t need to worry; the werewolves of the Charon Forest would never dare to attack the Ascart House.\u201d\u201cI-is that true?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s true.\u201dAnna looked at the large eyes of the little boy before her and instinctively fondled his soft face. An inexplicable thought arose in her mind:This tyrant actually has a cute side to him too.\u201cAnna\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for scolding you yesterday.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dBefore Anna could calm herself from this mystifying turn of events, another bomb was placed right into her hands. The maid widened her eyes in shock, displaying her disbelief that this arrogant young master would actually know to apologize.\u201cI was wrong yesterday. The times before too. I\u2019m sorry *hic* for always hitting and scolding you all.\u201d\u201cNo no, young master, you\u2019re still young! It\u2019s normal for children of your age to be mischievous, we have never blamed you for it!\u201d Anna quickly consoled the little boy, who was wallowing in self-reproach.At the same time, a thought surfaced in her mind:Could it be that our young master has grown up, and he\u2019s going to be a decent person from now on?\u201cAnna, I\u2019ll never act that way anymore. Can you forgive Roel?\u201dThe little boy looked at the maid with eyes glistening from tears. The silver emblem pinned on his chest gleamed brilliantly under the sunlight. Faced with such a Roel, Anna found her heart melting bit by bit, and before she knew it, she was already nodding her head.\u201cOf course!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great\u2026 Ah!\u201dRoel, who had been devoting all of his emotions into carrying out the script, suddenly yelped out loud, causing Anna to blink her eyes in confusion.In the moment that Anna agreed to forgive Roel, the little boy saw green light rising from Anna\u2019s head, forming a series of words.Affection Points +150!Holy moly! It\u2019s really possible to earn Affection Points like this, and it\u2019s more than I thought!Roel clenched his fists tightly together from agitation as hope lit up in his eyes.Hehe, I\u2019ll be able to gather Affection Points way faster than gold coin then!Experiment, success!Alicia, I\u2019m really coming now!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201cL-lord Brother, a pleasant afternoon to you.\u201dIt was afternoon, and Marquess Carter had gone out to deal with other affairs, leaving just Roel and Alicia in the spacious dining room for lunch.The moment the silver-haired girl saw her slightly older stepbrother, she recalled the frightening look the latter had looked at her with. She was terrified of him, but she still tried her best to buck up her courage and greet him politely, to which, Roel replied with a simple nod.Following that, under the assistance of the maids, Alicia was settled right before Roel on this long table that could easily hold twenty people. It was in a slightly awkward silence that the two of them waited for the maids to serve the dishes.The silver-haired girl had her head lowered as she nervously gripped her skirt beneath the table. From time to time, she would glance at Roel before swiftly averting her eyes once more, revealing the trepidation she felt inside.Roel knew that Alicia was waiting for him to speak up and reveal the reason why they were having this luncheon together.In noble families like the Ascart House, whenever the patriarch, Marquess Carter, was not around, children like Roel and Alicia would tend to have their luncheon privately in their rooms. One reason was to cut cost, and the other one was to uphold the solemn dignity of the head of the house.However, as the Ascart House was not lacking in money, and Roel, as the sole successor, was heavily doted on, he had the authority to change the venue where the luncheon should be held at his discretion.The significance of this deed, however, came across in a different manner to Alicia.The very first reason that came to Alicia\u2019s mind as to why Roel would call her out while their father was away was that Roel wanted to flex his authority and give her a warning. The world of the nobles was very different from that of the rest of the world. Oppression was common even amongst children, and the lack of maturity to conceal the oppression often resulted in things getting ugly.There was a huge gap between a daughter adopted from a baron family and the sole son of a marquess family. It was in no way an exaggeration to say that all it took was a word from Roel to turn Alicia\u2019s life into a living hell, and she would have no way to retaliate at all.What? Tell Marquess Carter about it, you say?Marquess Carter was perhaps an impartial person, and he might protect Alicia in view of his relationship with Alicia\u2019s father. However, what would happen when Marquess Carter was not around? Grudges amongst children were often far more frightening than what adults could imagine; just the intervention of an adult wouldn\u2019t stop things.It was just like back then\u2026Terror flickered across Alicia\u2019s crimson eyes as she recalled her past. She raised her head to look at the little boy seated opposite to her, and Roel\u2019s small body seemed to overlap together with the boys who had once humiliated her. It made her lower her head even more, as if there was something pulling her down.What she was oblivious to was that the demon king in her heart, Roel, was even more nervous than her at the moment!Damn! How am I supposed to earn the affection of a 7-year-old child?Roel, who had 29 years behind him if one were to count his two lives, sat on his chair in a daze. He felt an urge to ruffle his hair from frustration.The reason why he invited Alicia down to the dining room to have luncheon together was simple enough\u2014how could he win the affection of someone whom he didn\u2019t even meet with?But when the two of them were finally sitting face-to-face, he found himself not knowing what to say to her, and the pressure of having to make a good second impression wasn\u2019t helping at all.Hey sis, let\u2019s get close to one another!Tsk, doesn\u2019t sound too right either!After pondering for a very long while, Roel decided to go about it formally in the end.\u201cAlicia, I neglected to introduce myself earlier because I was feeling a little under the weather. My name is Roel, and I\u2019ll be your stepbrother from this day onward.\u201cYes, Lord Brother.\u201d\u201cFeel free to tell me if you face any difficulties in this house in the future.\u201d\u201cYes, Lord Brother.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re feeling bored, you can also come by my room to look for me.\u201d\u201cYes, Lord Brother.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat the hell was that? Are you a parrot?!Roel looked at the little girl before him, who kept repeating the same words with her head lowered, and a fact quickly dawned upon him\u2014none of what he was saying was getting through at all.He wasn\u2019t gaining any affection out of this, and Alicia was still as cold as ever toward him. She was polite and obedient, but her attitude was pushing him miles and miles away.This child\u2026 Why does her heart feel so closed? It feels like she has matured beyond her age.For kids of our age, shouldn\u2019t the act of asking someone out to play already a symbol of goodwill and friendship? I thought that we\u2019ll be able to walk out of the dining room with our hands together and head for the garden to play in the mud together.Having failed his first wave of attack, Roel found himself at a loss as to how to proceed. On the other hand, Alicia heaved a sigh of relief.Distancing herself from others with a courteous front was Alicia\u2019s way of protecting herself. For someone who had been bullied and harassed by boys due to her appearance, Alicia didn\u2019t believe in the bonds between humans at all. Even if she managed to get close enough to someone to play together, they would eventually distance themselves from her out of fear due to her peculiarity, and it was only a matter of time before this fear transformed them into demons that oppressed her.Yes, this is fine.The little girl thought to herself as she clutched her skirt tightly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA heavy silence fell upon the dining room. Roel was completely helpless against the heavily guarded Alicia, till the servants finally walked in and laid out the cutleries.\u201cAH!\u201dWhile exquisitely designed cutleries were placed gently before the two of them, Alicia suddenly let out a shout of exclamation, confusing the servants. A spark flashed across in Roel\u2019s mind as he recalled a certain scene inside the game.Oh right! She\u2019s afraid of this!My chance has come!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Drive It Into Your Head, This Is My Little Sister!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5: Drive It Into Your Head, This Is My Little Sister!Roel suddenly recalled something\u2014Alicia, in her younger years, was afraid of knives.To be more exact, she was frightened of anything sharp that could potentially be used to hurt her.As a saying back on Earth goes, \u2018once bitten, twice shy\u2019. This saying described an irrational fear toward certain objects often stemming from certain traumatic experiences, perhaps more commonly known as a phobia.Phobias induced feelings of tension and fear in one under certain specific circumstances. Even if one knew such emotions were irrational, one\u2019s body would still cower instinctively in the face of similar circumstances, hindering one\u2019s daily life.Phobias could manifest in many ways, but Alicia\u2019s phobia was directed toward sharp objects.As for the reason behind that\u2026 Roel could only say that those who possessed exceptional talents often had to bear great pain too.Sighing deeply in his heart, Roel began to recall how Alicia\u2019s childhood was depicted in the storyline.All of Alicia\u2019s misfortune originated from her bloodline. Yes, the same highest Silver Bloodline that Roel salivated over, Silverash Child.Bloodlines were not as simple as they seemed in this world. They were termed as Sia\u2019s Gifts. Sia was the creator of this world, and the continent was named after her. She was also the central deity of the Saint Mesit Theocracy. From such a perspective, possessors of bloodlines were considered as God\u2019s Children.The term, bloodline, was actually quite misleading. The powers granted through bloodlines weren\u2019t hereditary. It was common for a couple who both possessed bloodlines to give birth to a perfectly ordinary child, and it was also equally possible for bloodlines to appear amongst the children of ordinary stature.However, bloodlines were useless until they were awakened, and awakenings were tied to the concept of \u2018tier\u2019.Bloodlines could be classified into four tiers, the highest being \u2018Gold\u2019 and the lowest being \u2018Iron\u2019. Each awakening would raise the tier of one\u2019s bloodline once, so a bloodline possessor might have to undergo several awakenings in order to reach the full potential of his bloodline.To put it in other words, possessors of Silver Bloodline would have to awaken twice, and possessors of Gold Bloodline would have to awaken thrice. The number of bloodline possessors in each tier reduced exponentially up the tier, and Gold Bloodlines were so rare that there were times that they didn\u2019t appear within a country for decades.Alicia had already awakened once, so her bloodline tier was currently Bronze. However, the powers she had awakened to weren\u2019t regarded highly, and she was even bullied due to that.Her ability was high-speed regeneration.It might sound like nothing much, but the sight of her skin wriggling about as she recovered from her injuries was something that could induce discomfort in others, so it wasn\u2019t too hard to imagine how immature rascals would respond to it.This peculiar trait of hers, as well as the fact that her father was rarely at home and her innate introversion, led to her tragic childhood. Of course, another crucial reason was also because no one thought that this little girl, who appeared to be nothing much except for her looks, would have been able to awaken her bloodline once more to Silver-tier, resulting in her abilities to fully blossom.While Roel was pondering over these matters, the silver-haired girl sitting opposite him was shivering from fear.Looking at the human silhouettes reflected on the knife and the metallic glimmer from the sharp tips of the fork, the tiny Alicia began to recall what she had been put through.It was at the birthday celebration of the princess a year ago. Her wine-loving father had gotten himself drunk. There, a few sons from count and viscount houses had cornered her with knives and forks in their hands. Treating her as if she was a tool meant for their entertainment, they disregarded her cries and plunged their knives and forks into her body. One of them even tried to stab his fork into her eyes to see if she was capable of regenerating her eyes too.It was fortunate that one of the adults happened to stumble onto the cruelty of these children and chased them away, or else Alicia might have lost her sanity there and then. Nevertheless, the incident haunted her ever since and became her worst nightmare.It was from then on that Alicia began to fear sharp objects like knives and forks, not just those in the hands of others but even in her own too. Her father had once tried to encourage her to overcome this phobia, but it was futile.Ever since then, the only cutlery that Alicia would use was the spoon, and this continued for the past year. As she had only arrived in the Ascart House barely a few hours ago, there was no one who knew that she couldn\u2019t use forks and knives, and today\u2019s main dish happened to be pan-seared lamb steak, which necessitated the use of the knife and fork.The delicious dishes had already been served on the dining table, and the servants stood on standby by the sides of the room. The moment the black-haired boy picked up his cutleries, the gleam reflected off their metallic surfaces caused Alicia to visibly shudder a little.\u201cAlicia, our Ascart House is known for our specialty lamb steak. Do have a taste of it,\u201d Roel looked at the terrified silver-haired girl as he spoke words that blocked off her route of escape.It was not out of some sort of cruel interest to inflict suffering upon her that he was doing this. Rather, he needed to first \u2018witness\u2019 Alicia\u2019s fear, or else he wouldn\u2019t be able to help her.This was the second time that they were meeting one another, so there should have been no way for Roel to know that she was unable to use sharp cutleries. Thus, he needed to create an opportunity for himself to intervene in the situation.Unfortunately for him, his words caused Alicia\u2019s vivid imagination to run wild. She meekly glanced at Roel with her quivering eyes as a possibility surfaced in her mind.Could it be that Roel has heard of my phobia before?There was no way she could verify this deduction of hers, but the noble circle was only that big, especially amongst children, so it was not unthinkable for Roel to have heard of the \u2018mysterious lifeform\u2019 named Alicia. If so, that would explain the reason behind this abrupt formal luncheon together.Moreover, Roel even raised the name of the Ascart House in his earlier statement, which was practically coercing Alicia into doing as he said.Whenever nobles brought up the name of their houses, it was usually with the intent to strong-arm the person they were talking to and make things go their way. Unless one had the resolve to offend the other party, the only option that one could go with was to agree with it.It would have been deeply disrespectful for Alicia to reject Roel right now, and Roel could use it as an excuse to make things difficult for her in the future if she were to do so.The silver-haired girl clasped her hands tightly together under the dining table.I mustn\u2019t let him know my weakness, or else\u2026 what that awaits me will be a brand new hell.With such thoughts in mind, Alicia\u2019s small, trembling hands slowly inched toward the fork and knife on the table. Her beautiful face had turned ghastly pale, and tears were glistening in her eyes. She had to bite down on her lips to stop herself from whimpering.On the opposite side of the dining table, Roel widened his eyes upon seeing Alicia reaching for her fork and knife.What\u2019s going on? Why is she picking up those cutleries? Does this mean to say that the current Alicia doesn\u2019t have a phobia toward sharp objects yet?No, that\u2019s not right! She hasn\u2019t picked them up yet. Her hands are trembling!Seeing how Alicia was desperately pushing herself to overcome her fear to pick up the cutleries while holding back the urge to cry, Roel suddenly felt a stabbing pain in his heart. Unable to bear the sight anymore, he immediately interjected right in.\u201cHold it for a moment. Alicia is only 7 years old, so it\u2019ll be inconvenient for her to use a knife and a fork\u2026 Anna.\u201d\u201cYoung master, what orders do you have?\u201d\u201cMove my seat over to Alicia\u2019s side.\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201dThe maids quickly moved Roel\u2019s food and cutleries over. Just like that, Alicia watched in shock as the black-haired boy walked around the dining table to take the seat adjacent to her. Following that, he pulled her plate of lamb steak over to his side.\u201cL-lord Brother?\u201d\u201cSince you aren\u2019t proficient in the use of knives and forks, allow me to slice your lamb steak on your behalf.\u201dAs Roel picked up his cutleries and was just about to begin working on the lamb steak, Anna suddenly stepped forward from behind and bowed slightly.\u201cYoung master, please leave such matters to us.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. Alicia is my younger sister. I\u2019ll take care of her myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I understand, young master.Anna was slightly taken aback by those words, and she stared at the little boy before her contemplatively for a moment before quietly backing to the side of the room once more.Roel\u2019s earlier words could be taken as a declaration to all of the servants in the room, or perhaps, calling it a warning might have been more apt.There was no way none of them would have noticed that Alicia wasn\u2019t even able to pick up her cutleries earlier, but none of them stepped out to say words like \u2018Miss, allow me to do it on your behalf\u2019, choosing to turn a blind eye to it instead. Had it been Roel in her position, someone would have already stood forward to offer his service long ago.This wasn\u2019t just out of consideration of Roel. More than that, it also reflected just how little regard these servants had for Alicia as an adopted child of the Ascart House.A servant\u2019s standing was determined by the house that he belonged to, and the servants of the Ascart House had seen plenty of high nobles in the years they had worked here. In their view, the daughter of a baron house was simply not a priority to them.By declaring Alicia as his younger sister, the servants would have to view her as a true member of the Ascart Family, one of their masters. Anyone who dared to snub Alicia after this would be viewed to be undermining Roel\u2019s authority as well.While Roel had managed to convey his meaning across well, he soon regretted his decision by a little\u2014his arms were starting to ache.Tsk! Why is this knife and fork so heavy? Is this all the strength that a 9-year-old child has? How can I possibly lose to a mere lamb steak? After all I\u2019ve said, it would be embarrassing if it turns out that I can\u2019t do it by myself!\u201cLord Brother, shall we get someone else\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. I can do it.\u201dUnwilling to admit to the fact that he was a weakling, a tenacious streak sparked inside Roel as he began to saw the lamb steak aggressively, as if dealing with his mortal enemy.Watching the black-haired boy from the side, Alicia\u2019s expression slowly began to change.Several minutes later, Roel finally managed to slice the lamb steak into bite-size pieces. He tossed the knife and fork aside and scooped up a piece of meat with his spoon.Yes, Roel was going beyond just personally slicing the meat. He was going to personally feed her too!\u201cAlicia, open your mouth.\u201d\u201cAh? B-but\u2026\u201d\u201cListen to me and open your mouth.\u201d\u201cA-alright.\u201dA pair of crimson eyes met a pair of golden eyes on the dining table. The silver-haired litlte girl hesitated for a moment before she brushed aside the hair by the side of her face and leaned forward to eat off Roel\u2019s spoon.At this very instant, she could sense the change in attitude that everyone in this dining room had for her. The servants who initially looked at her with traces of disdain in their gazes were now either staring shocked at their intimacy or pondering with their heads lowered. With such a simple move from Roel, the prejudice toward her was shattered.The fragrant juices of the lamb steak exploded inside her mouth, carrying a slight touch of vanilla to it. As Alicia munched on the bite-size meat that Roel went through great difficulty to prepare for her, she suddenly felt an urge to cry.So, there really is a person in the world other than her father who is willing to treat her so nicely?\u201cHow is it? Tastes alright?\u201d\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s delicious.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAlicia continued biting on the meat as she secretly wiped her eyes with her hands. She looked at the little boy sitting before her, and she could see warmth within his eyes.She felt like she should say something in this situation, but no words came to her when she opened her mouth.A long while later, after numerous times of opening and closing her mouth in futility, she finally squeezed out a sentence with great hardship.\u201cThank you, Lord Brother.\u201dAffection Points +1000!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Haha.\u201dUnder Alicia\u2019s concerned look, Roel shrugged it off with a laugh as he glanced at the top of her head. Due to the two year age gap between them, Alicia was half a head shorter than him, so the \u2018Affection Points +1000\u2019 was practically sticking right next to his face.Holy moly! 1000 Affections Points! A freaking four-digit figure!Roel was screaming frenziedly in his mind, and he had a strong urge to do a celebratory dance right on the spot. While the Emblem of Glory probably played a huge role too, it was still unbelievable to him that a four-digit figure would roll in just by feeding Alicia a spoonful of meat. This was way better than him tearing up before Anna!Roel turned to look at Alicia with his golden eyes once more, and this time, other than pity, his eyes also carried a hint of joy too.By brushing up Alicia\u2019s affection, not only will I be able to avert my death flag, I\u2019ll be able to strike it rich too! This is killing two birds with one stone!\u201cCome, have another mouthful. Ah\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cGlomp.\u201dAffection Points +50!\u201cAlicia, this beetroot is delicious.

It has a citrusy sweetness to it. You should have a try.\u201d\u201cGlub glub\u2026 Lord Brother, this orange juice is really, really sweet!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it so? I also think it\u2019s delicious too.\u201dAffection Points +100!It was as if a switch inside Roel had been flicked on when he saw how numbers that kept popping up above Alicia\u2019s head. He immediately got into his overly doting brother mode and ordered his servants to grab everything delicious that he could think of within the house and bring it over.\u201cBring me the chocolates that Viscount Ryan sent me for my birthday this year.\u201d\u201cBring me the milk candy that my father gave me.\u201dQuick, just bring everything here!Standing behind the duo, Anna stared with googly eyes as the selfish and bad-tempered young master she struggled to handle unhesitatingly brought out all of the good stuff he had stashed away to share them with Anna. Even the Seven-colored Royal Macarons that he couldn\u2019t bear to eat went right into Alicia\u2019s mouth, as if fearing that she wouldn\u2019t have enough to eat.What in the world is going on? Does the young master really like his new stepsister so much? It doesn\u2019t make sense for their relationship to have proceeded to such an extent so quickly\u2026 Or could it be that\u2026Anna\u2019s eyes widened even larger. Looking at the loving siblings before her, she thought that she might have just inadvertently stumbled upon the truth.Heh, is that how it is? Well, I must admit that Miss Alicia is a beauty in the making.Looking at the blissfully smiling silver-haired girl, Anna\u2019s lips inched upward to form a knowing adult smile.That explains why the young master acted so out of character the first time they met. It turns out that he has fallen in love with little Alicia at first sight! I must say, children nowadays sure mature fast!Anna placed her hand dreamily on her slightly reddened cheeks as her imagination ran off in a direction that wasn\u2019t particularly family-friendly. But soon enough, she snapped out of her thoughts and looked at the little duo before her with a worried frown.While it was gladdening to see that the two of them were getting along well, it was a pity that Alicia was the daughter of a baron house. With such a background, it would be nearly impossible for her to marry into a marquess house\u2026 Wait a moment, this was not right!Anna, who was just about to arbitrarily proclaim that this budding romance would end in tragedy, suddenly thought of another factor that she had neglected\u2014the crisis the Ascart House faced over its lack of offspring.The Ascart House was a distinguished noble lineage with many years of history behind it, but consecutive generations of poor birth rates had resulted in Marquess Carter and his sole son, Roel, to be the only ones left in the lineage. Under such circumstances, it would be unwise for Roel to seek a political marriage with other houses.The reason was simple\u2014they would be in a vulnerable position if the other party coveted their wealth.It was a known fact that Roel was the only successor to the Ascart House, which meant he would eventually inherit Marquess Carter\u2019s position. If any nobles were to covet the Ascart House\u2019s wealth and power, they could simply marry their daughter to Roel and seek an opportunity to do away with him. The Ascart House would then be left without a successor, thus placing Roel\u2019s wife next in the line of succession.Such vile acts had already happened several times in history to houses with few members in their lineage. While such actions were frowned upon in the circle of nobility, there was little that could be done if there was no evidence to convict the culprits, and culprits were rarely foolish enough to leave behind any incriminating evidence.Looking at it from such a perspective, Alicia would indeed be a better option. Despite her lower lineage, she was in an advantageous position due to the close ties between the Ascart House and the baron house that she had descended from, which meant that the Ascart House had a good grasp of Alicia\u2019s background as well.As long as the little duo could cultivate feelings for one another from a young age, Alicia would indubitably be the best candidate as Roel\u2019s wife!Perhaps, the old master leaving to deal with some urgent matters might even have been part of the plan as well to create an opportunity for the young master to get close to Miss Alicia. This would mean that Miss Alicia has already been internally decided as young master Roel\u2019s future wife!What about Alicia\u2019s identity as an adopted child of the Ascart House, you may ask? That didn\u2019t pose a problem at all. All they had to do was to send Alicia out to be adopted by another house before having Roel to marry her back into the Ascart House!Having come up with a complete scenario in her mind, Anna looked at Alicia with gleaming eyes. She felt like she had managed to peer through the intricate fabrics of the circle of nobility to arrive at the truth. What she didn\u2019t know was that none of what she had just come up with had ever flashed across Roel\u2019s mind.All Roel could think of right now were the rows of Affection Points popping up above Alicia\u2019s head.+60 Affection Points! +75 Affection Points! +110 Affection Points! +95 Affection Points\u2026Roel felt as if he was watching an ATM machine shooting out banknotes all over the air. His Affection Points were increasing at an incredible pace, surpassing the 2000 mark within a short span of time.But as the saying went, \u2018the overeager won\u2019t be able to eat hot tofu\u2019. It was not wise for him to rush things right now. As compared to the initial swift increment, the Affection Points rising above Alicia\u2019s head were growing fewer and fewer, and Roel knew exactly the reason behind that.\u201cLord Brother, I-I can\u2019t eat anymore.\u201dWith a huge feast of delicacies and desserts placed before her, the silver-haired girl rubbed her stomach and spoke up in embarrassment.Faced with such a situation, Roel knew it would be best to wrap things up here. He was already more than contented to have been able to earn over 2000 Affection Points in a single meal, and Alicia did have a little too much to eat.\u201cSince you\u2019re full, let\u2019s end this luncheon here. Out of consideration that you aren\u2019t able to use a fork and knife properly yet, you\u2019ll have your meals with me for the time being.\u201d\u201cAh? H-how can that do? To impose so much on Lord Brother would be\u2026\u201d\u201cHm? Are you averse to the idea?\u201d\u201cNo! There\u2019s no way I would be! I\u2019m just afraid that I\u2019ll be troubling you too much\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble at all. You\u2019re my little sister, and this is what I should do as your older brother. You need not think of it that way.\u201dI\u2019ll brawl with anyone who dares to say otherwise!With a grand wave of his hand, Roel dispelled the final unease in Alicia\u2019s heart. The silver-haired girl smiled with a slightly reddened glow on her face, and a series of numbers appeared above her head once more.Affection Points +500!Uwaa! Alicia, are you an angel? You don\u2019t know how much I love you right now!Roel was deeply touched by this final sum he received. He bade farewell to Alicia before the latter proceeded to leave the dining room. This time around, however, her treatment was far better than before.\u201cMiss Alicia, please be careful.\u201dDue to Alicia\u2019s shorter stature, the chairs in the dining room were a little too tall for her, such that her feet were unable to reach the ground. She was just about to hop down the chair when three maids suddenly rushed forward to support her. Their attitude toward Alicia was much more amiable than before, treating her with the respect that a daughter of a marquess house deserved.\u201cPlease hold my hand.\u201d\u201cBe careful.\u201dAlicia was treated like a fragile porcelain doll as the servants carefully supported her down from the chair. She pondered a while over the sudden change in the attitude of these adults before finally turning to look at Roel with gratitude in her eyes.Affection Points +500!\u201cThank you, Lord Brother.\u201d\u201cHm? It\u2019s nothing much. I\u2019ll be seeing you later for dinner.\u201d\u201cUn! I\u2019ll be taking my leave then.\u201dAlicia courteously lifted her skirt slightly and curtsied before leaving the dining hall a little reluctantly.After seeing off his beloved stepsister, Roel was finally able to get back to his meal. He was so focused on feeding Alicia and earning Affection Points earlier that he hadn\u2019t been able to eat anything.\u201cHm? Why is there another 500 Affection Points?\u201d Roel muttered under his breath while chewing on his lamb steak.Another additional 500 Affection Points had suddenly been added to him, causing the total amount of Affection Points he had to rise beyond 3000.The fact that he was able to earn so many Affection Points within just a few hours was indubitably good news for both him and the Ascart House. The more Affection Points he earned, the lower the chance of the Ascart House declining and him turning into a tragic cannon fodder villain.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter this huge harvest, it was time to move on to the next step, and that was to try out the Affection Points Exchange Shop and see if it was really possible to make purchases.Otherwise, if he were to find that there was some hidden caveat behind the Affection Points Exchange Shop after saving several hundred thousand Affection Points, it would really be a huge tragedy.To be safe, it was best for him to try it out for first.Having made up his mind, Roel turned his sights toward the Affection Points Exchange Shop.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - Give Me A Good OnePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7: Give Me A Good OneRoel believed deeply in spending money only on things that were worth their value.Having made a small fortune for himself, Roel spent two hours taking a more detailed look through the items in the Affection Points Exchange Shop, and he soon noticed something.As the tip from the System had mentioned, the Gold Coin Shop mostly consisted of items that improved his individual characteristics. The items in the Affection Points Exchange Shop, on the other hand, appeared to be a little more peculiar.Take this for example:\u3010Banshee\u2019s UmbrellaIt screams during heavy downpours.Price: 500 Affection Points\u30112 replies\u00a0\u2013 3 hours ago\u201c\u2026\u201dAre you joking with me? What is the use of something like that?Screams during heavy downpours? What is the use of that? Would the rain disappear just because the umbrella screamed? Besides, if one were to flip its meaning around, isn\u2019t it just an ordinary umbrella when it\u2019s not raining then?The cheapest good that Roel found so far cost 500 Affection Points, but it would appear that he couldn\u2019t expect quality out of cheap stuff. The cheapest items were so bizarre that he had no idea how he could use them at all.While Roel\u2019s aim was to test out the functions of the Affection Points Exchange Shop, he didn\u2019t want to buy items that he had no need for. These were precious Affection Points that he had earned by giving up his beloved milk candies and chocolate!After spending a long time browsing through the list of items, Roel finally stumbled upon something that still looked decent.\u3010Skeleton Pallbearer ArmyThe summoned beings of the Commandment Cult\u2019s Gravediggers. Born for death, they bring joy to the living.Price: 2500 Affection Points\u3011Hm\u2026 I don\u2019t really get it, but it sounds quite amazing. It should be a combat-related item, right? Furthermore, the item illustration also looks quite formidable, a huge skeleton head.Seems like an okay choice!Having come to a decision, Roel finally leaped down from the chair he was sitting on.\u201cAnna, I\u2019ll be heading to the training field in our backyard later in the afternoon.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make preparations right away.\u201dAfter Anna left the room, Roel headed back to his bedroom with the other servants to take a short nap. As a 9-year-old at the moment, he needed to have sufficient sleep in order to grow up well.After busying himself for the day and having his fill of food, the drowsiness was already setting in, so it didn\u2019t take long for his consciousness to start drifting off. This made him deeply cognizant of the fact that he was indeed a small child now.Roel had once heard someone saying that a human was a slave of his hormones, or that a person\u2019s body would influence one\u2019s train of thoughts. He hadn\u2019t thought too much into those theories previously, but the current him felt that there were grains of truth in them.For one, shedding tears was definitely not something that the Roel of the previous world was able to do on command; being a 20-year-old adult, it was hard for him to tear up at all.Another thing that he noticed was that there were actually no lewd thoughts surfacing in his mind when he leaped into the embrace of the fairly beautiful Anna earlier on, which was probably just the kind of reaction one would expect from a 9-year-old.\u201cI guess libido really is the effect of our hormones at play.\u201dWhile muttering to himself, Roel finally fell into a deep sleep, charging up his energy for his activities later in the afternoon.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013The Ascart House\u2019s backyard was huge, at least in Roel\u2019s opinion.In the circle of nobility, the front yard represented the face of a noble house whereas the backyard was a reflection of their decorum. One of the ways how nobles determine if a noble house was declining was through looking at their backyard.In this world, gardening was viewed as an art form practiced exclusively by nobles. Nobles rarely engaged in physical activities, choosing instead to focus their efforts on nurturing plants and flowers to raise the aesthetics of their yards. Some of the richer nobles would even renovate their yards every season in order to uphold their distinguished image.While the Ascart House was rich, it wasn\u2019t as extravagant as those nobles. A huge part of that was simply because the patriarch, Marquess Carter, was a magician who wasn\u2019t too interested in art. Nevertheless, the Ascart House still employed two gardeners to maintain its two yards.Beside the exquisite backyard garden maintained by the two employed gardeners was the Ascart House\u2019s training field.This training field was mostly reserved for Roel to practice his spells. One thing of note was that most noble houses didn\u2019t have such a facility. The Ascart House only happened to be an exception due to its illustrious lineage of skilled magicians. It was not uncommon for members of the Ascart House to charge alongside a bunch of muscle heads on the battlefield, so it was only natural for it to have such a facility.However, due to the superior strength of Marquess Carter, he rarely frequented the training field ever since reaching adulthood. It was only after Roel\u2019s birth that the training field was finally opened once more.\u201cAnna, I need you to leave with the others first. I would like some time to myself to ruminate.\u201d\u201cYoung master, you should have someone by your side when you practice.\u201d\u201cThere are no weapons here, and you are aware of the spells I am able to use too. There\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dIt took quite a while before Roel finally managed to persuade his personal maid to guard the entrance to the backyard. After finally being freed from his guardian, it was time for Roel to go all out.\u201cSystem, I want to purchase Skeleton Pallbearer Army from the Affection Points Exchange Shop!\u201d\u3010Request received.\u3011\u3010Are you certain that you wish to spend 2500 Affection Points to purchase Skeleton Pallbearer Army?\u3011\u3010Yes/No\u3011\u201cYes!\u201d\u3010You have obtained Skeleton Pallbearer Army. You may choose a location to place it down.\u3011Following those words, a shadow of 2 meters in height suddenly appeared within Roel\u2019s sight. It felt similar to the games of the previous world, where a player, after selecting a building to construct, had to choose a location to place it down. Roel chose a flat ground three meters away from him.A burst of dark wind congregated within the area that Roel selected, and an ominous-looking black coffin materialized on the ground, emanating a chilling air of eeriness. Six skeleton soldiers stood neatly in two rows beside the coffin. They kneeled on the ground on one knee with their heads lowered, displaying their deference to whoever was inside the black coffin.2 replies\u00a0\u2013 3 hours agoRoel was astounded by this imposing sight. This was the first time he was coming into contact with the supernatural powers of this world ever since regaining his memories, so he was unable to come to terms with it right away. Nevertheless, he quickly recovered from his shock and began skipping around in joy.\u201cHoly moly, they really are skeleton soldiers! And I\u2019m getting six of them for just 2500 Attraction Points?!\u201dEven if these skeleton soldiers were lower-tier troops, it felt like a huge value for money given the Affection Points they cost. At this rate, he might really be able to summon a massive army of skeletons at will, making him a nigh invincible existence in this world!Roel was so excited that he began rolling around the ground in glee. It took a while before he managed to calm his ecstasy down and return back to his feet.\u201cCough cough, I need to calm down first. It\u2019s still too early to be rejoicing. I still have no idea how powerful these skeleton soldiers are yet. Right, I should give it a try.\u201dWith such thoughts in mind, Roel turned to the wooden pole by the side and issued an order, \u201cAttack! Cut the pole down!\u201dThe empty eye sockets of the six skeleton soldiers lit up slightly as they turned their heads toward the wooden pole. Then, with a series of creaking sounds, they rose to their feet and stood tall like warriors preparing for war.Then, they lowered their waist, propped up the coffin, and placed it on their shoulders.???Hold it right there, what\u2019s going on? Is the coffin their weapon?No, wait a moment. How is it that this scene looks so familiar to me?While Roel was deep in thought, the six skeleton soldiers began dancing with unbelievably uniform movements as they marched forward in a neat formation. Their movements were so smooth that it was hard to believe that they were just skeletons.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 3 hours agoAt that moment, the world seemed to have fallen silent for Roel. A slight spring breeze blew a fallen leaf across Roel\u2019s frozen face, seemingly nudging him toward the greater world out there.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, Roel wasn\u2019t in the mood to think of anything else. Looking at the army of dancing skeletons before him, a thought surfaced in his mind.It\u2019s a team of professionals\u2026\u2014Pallbearers are people who carry the coffin during a funeral procession.

What I want is skeleton soldiers, so why are you giving me professional dancing skeleton pallbearers here?!\u201dOn the training field, a deeply frustrated black-haired boy stared agape at the skeleton pallbearers, who were dancing with the coffin while making their way over to the wooden pole, and he suddenly felt that he had been scammed.It\u2019s 2500 Affection Points, a hulking 2500! Did I really spend so much money just to buy this? What in the world do I need this for? For my own funeral procession?Roel clutched his chest, which was hurting so badly that he felt like he was having a heart attack. Then, he snapped out of it and attempted to make one final struggle.\u201cStop right there for a moment!\u201d\u2026Ten minutes later.Roel lay down on the grass field as he stared at the blue sky and white clouds above him with the eyes of a dead fish. The six skeleton pallbearers were currently kneeled by the side of the black coffin, as if waiting to carry him out.After a series of trials and errors, Roel finally understood something\u2026 these skeleton pallbearers couldn\u2019t be used for battle at all!He could call these skeleton pallbearers out separately, but despite their lively movements with the coffin, as soon as they were 2 meters away from the coffin, they suddenly became as weak as a newborn chick. Even the tier F- Roel was able to fight them to a draw!One must know that Roel was a 9-year-old kid whose proficiency in magic paled in comparison to his fellow Magician Apprentices. Since each skeleton pallbearer was equivalent to Roel in terms of strength, it would mean that the total fighting prowess of the Skeleton Pallbearer Army was a pathetic 6 Roels!Or to put it in simpler terms, it was useless.While this world did operate by the adage that there was no useless occupation, there was still a significant disparity in the strengths of individuals. Based on the evaluation standards of the System, adult men without any exceptional skills were F-rank; magicians which had undergone formal militia training were E-rank; those who had managed to become knights or warriors were D-rank.These skeleton pallbearers were F- trash when they were 2 meters away from the coffin, and F+ when they were within 2 meters. This meant that even an E-rank militia could single-handedly obliterate them all!Roel had also taken a peek inside the coffin they were carrying, and it was empty. That being said, the coffin was made of rather good material.The summoned beings of the Commandment Cult\u2019s Gravediggers. Born for death, they bring joy to the living.Recalling how these skeleton pallbearers danced along with the coffin, a look of realization appeared on Roel\u2019s face. He finally understood what the description of the item meant.Commandment Cult, I\u2019ll remember you!Just see if I\u2019ll buy your stuff anymore! I\u2019ll be a dog if I get anything else of yours!Roel swore with gritted teeth before taking a few deep breaths to calm himself down. While the turn of events had frustrated him, at the very least, the experiment to purchase an item from the shops was a success, and that was the most important thing for now.It was a pity that he had wasted 2500 Affection Points on this, but this amount was nothing much compared to how much he would earn in the future. As long as he had those two shops in the System backing him up, he was confident that a day would come where he would be able to unfurl his wings and soar to the top!Just thinking about it made him tremble in excitement.Having lowered his expectations, Roel no longer carried as much hostility toward the Skeleton Pallbearer Army anymore. At the very least, he had learned an important lesson from this, and that was to never judge a book by its cover, especially in those two shops of the System.No matter how awe-inspiring the name sounded and how mysterious the description sounded, I\u2019ll never be deceived again!\u201cAm I supposed to use them to earn money? But how am I supposed to go around doing so\u2026\u201dRoel placed his hand beneath his chin as he looked at the skeleton pallbearers contemplatively. According to the System, the items available on the Affection Points Exchange Shop were supposed to be used to earn money, but was it really possible to put these skeleton pallbearers to good use? Their appearance was a problem by itself, but even the way they conducted funeral processions was very different from the customs of the Theocracy.Would the people of this world be able to accept sending away the dead with joyous dancing?On top of that, he wasn\u2019t too sure just how the people of this world viewed the undead too. This detail wasn\u2019t mentioned in the game. Just by the name Saint Mesit Theocracy, he had a strong feeling that the people here might not be very fond of the undead.Roel pondered for a while, and he felt that there was a need for him to supplement his understanding of this world first. He remembered that there were a few basic books in his room that he couldn\u2019t be bothered to flip through all this while.Having made up his mind, Roel began thinking of a place to hide these six coffin-bearing simpletons from view first. As it turned out, anything that he had bought from the System couldn\u2019t be conveniently kept back into some sort of mystical inventory anymore. So, he would have to find a safe place to stow them away.So, he issued an order for the six skeleton pallbearers to move over to the resting room by the side of the training field. It took some effort, but they managed to squeeze the coffin through the doorway in the end.Roel nodded to himself. He was the only one who used the training field, so it went without saying that this resting room was usually deserted. Furthermore, it had just been cleaned today, so he didn\u2019t have to worry about anyone stumbling upon these skeleton pallbearers for the time being.Having settled everything, Roel finally left with ease of heart to embark on his route to wisdom.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cHm? It looks like there\u2019s a difference between mages and magicians?\u201dIn the study room, Roel was flipping through a book named Origin of Magicians, which was as thick as a brick, and he felt like his understanding of the world was being swiftly renewed.It wouldn\u2019t have been entirely wrong to call the 9-year-old Roel a good-for-nothing. Despite having a highly respected magician as his father, the sheer extent of his ignorance was baffling. It was no wonder his own Phantom Hands would point a middle finger toward him.That was why he was frantically brushing up his knowledge right now. Through the books, he learned of an extremely important event in history that changed the course of the world, and that was the Spirit Cataclysm of the Capital.While Roel did know bits and pieces of this world\u2019s history through the game, it wasn\u2019t as complete and detailed as the historical records in the books.First and foremost, mages were, in fact, magicians prior to the Third Epoch. Just to know, the current date was the 1003rd Year of the Third Epoch, the Year of Warhorns. The inception of the Third Epoch was marked by an event known as the Spirit Cataclysm of the Capital.The era prior to the Third Epoch was one where the current existing countries had yet to be formed, and mankind had yet to migrate to the west. In that era, an enigmatic incident happened in the legendary ancient capital, and it was described by the historians as:\u201cUncountable spirits howled ceaselessly in the dark, their existences omnipresent. It was as if the crepuscule was trying to talk to us.\u201dThat incident eventually came to be known as the Whisperings of the Spirits. The descriptions in the book were ridiculously fantastical, and there were many reasons cited for the event too. But in any case, the world was never the same ever since the incident due to a change that swiftly followed.And that change was the corruption of mana.From then on, whenever magicians or knights absorbed mana from the atmosphere to use their supernatural powers, they could be inflicted with negative statuses. The luckier ones walked off with just a certain degree of physical harm, but those who were less fortunate descended into lunacy.There was nothing that could create a pandemonium as effectively as the collapse of a way of life.In the Ancient Austine Empire, where howling spirits roamed amidst an air of eeriness, the knights forsook their pride and turned against the people whom they had sworn their lives to protect, and the wise mages turned into barbarous beasts who gobbled up the bloodied innards of their own kind. Hundreds of people fled from the capital every single day, only to realize that the madness had spread across the entire empire.It was in the face of such events that the final emperor of the Ancient Austine Empire declared mass immigration to the west, proclaiming that the empire had been put under a curse by \u2018he-who-must-not-be-named\u2019. Decades later, after braving through untold dangers, traversing across huge swathes of miasma and charred lands, the group of people who chose to immigrate together with the empire finally arrived on this plot of land.A thousand years had passed since then, and mankind gradually developed new theories that helped them adapt to the corrupted mana in the atmosphere and utilize its prowess. The knights chose to retain their traditional names whereas the mages of the past had chosen to call themselves magicians.The magicians of the present day had lost the ability to cast magic unconditionally like the mages of the past, but in exchange, the prowess they could exert was far greater than before.There was an example raised in the Origin of Magicians. The earlier version of Phantom Hands, Death Grasp, originated from the mages. A mage could crush a person\u2019s neck with Death Grasp, but a magician could completely burst a person\u2019s head with Phantom Hands, though the magician would have to bear the cost of his hands getting burnt or turning numb.After gaining a rough understanding of the difference between the past mages and the current magicians, Roel moved on to look through the scriptures of Saint Mesit Theocracy and, to his relief, found that the religion itself didn\u2019t carry any animosity toward the undead. The reason behind that was because the undead was also viewed as a creation of Goddess Sia.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThat being said, it didn\u2019t necessarily mean that the populace in Saint Mesit Theocracy was accepting of the undead. At the very least, Roel didn\u2019t think that there would have been anyone in the world who would be fond of those six simpleton skeletons.This brought him back to the same question. He didn\u2019t want the very first item he had bought from the System to go to waste just like that, but given their appearance, how could he use them to bring profit to himself?Chop them up and feed them to the dogs?The black-haired boy scratched his head and he looked out of the window musingly. A long time later, his eyes slowly widened, and a smile crept onto his lips.Ah hah, that might work!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The realization of her inelegant behavior caused her to face to redden even further.Seeing this sight, Roel smiled kindly as he picked up a napkin and carefully wiped her face.\u201cLord Brother\u2026 I-I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d\u201cAllow me.\u201dRoel insisted as he hastened his movements slightly. Out of sheer embarrassment, Alicia directed her gaze downward, not daring to look Roel directly.Affection Points +200!Ooh Alicia, I love you!Seeing how his Affection Points were trickling up at an insane rate, Roel\u2019s feelings for Alicia transformed from deep fear into fanatic adoration in the course of a single day. He was starting to relate to the feelings of those idol-chasing fanboys.What he did not know, however, was that his attentive consideration was slowly pushing the reticent Alicia onto the path of a fangirl as well. If one could peer into the vibrant world inside her heart, one would be truly surprised by how she was still able to maintain such a stoic expression on her face.Lord Brother is such a gentle and kind person. He cares so much for me even though we\u2019re not real siblings.My chest feels warm, and I don\u2019t want to part from him. B-but if I were to appear too sticky right now, would I just put him off?Alicia clenched her small fists tightly as she recalled the pain she had been put through by those children who had oppressed her. There were also those who were curious about her and tried to get close to her by expressing their goodwill, but she could sense that Roel was different. Her experiences had made her extremely sensitive to the emotional fluctuations of those around her, and she could sense that the goodwill Roel had for her came right from the bottom of his heart.Alicia wanted to open her heart to him; she had been alone for far too long. She had been drowning in the malice of others for too long that she was desperate to reach out for the light and warmth before her, but she was simply unable to shake off the insecurities in her.What if he is only treating me well out of a moment of fascination? Just like how children eventually become sick of their toys, will he toss me aside once he loses interest in me?The experiences she had been through as a child had made her far too guarded, but she believed in the words of her deceased father\u2014true love will be able to withstand the trial of time.The silver-haired girl tried her best to hold herself back, but it was hard for her to calm herself before a person who was going all out to be nice to her.Had it not been for the fact that they had only known one another for a single day, Roel would have already given Alicia a tight hug and rubbed his cheek against hers!It was way too fast! Alicia\u2019s Affection Points for him were whizzing through the roof like a rocket, blasting through the atmosphere!Not to mention, Alicia was also incredibly cute as well, especially when her fair skin was dyed with a tinge of red blush. She was also polite and obedient despite her young age. Roel would not have a sliver of doubt if Alicia were to claim that she was an angel!How in the world could the original Roel even think of giving away such an adorable sister? Damn it, I\u2019ll chop off the head of anyone who dares to snatch her from me! Even if the Ascart House falls, no one is taking Alicia away from me!While reaffirming his Alicia-centric principles, Roel continued to deliver food into Alicia\u2019s mouth. As Alicia had already awakened her Bronze Bloodline, there was no need for her to worry about losing her figure; the bloodline would ensure that she would always remain in her most beautiful form.Without such a worry, Roel was able to go all out with his feeding. It was only when Alicia meekly waved her hand and expressed that she was unable to eat anymore did Roel finally give it a rest.Even after they had finished their dinner, the little duo was still unwilling to part from one another, so they chatted for a while longer. It was until the tired Alicia rubbed her closing eyes that Roel finally told her to head back to her room to rest.Marquess Carter didn\u2019t return for dinner as well. Such a situation had been common since a long time ago, so neither Roel nor the servants were too surprised by it.After heading back to his bedroom, Roel spent another two more hours reading before his little body finally started caving in to fatigue. Under Anna\u2019s support, he climbed onto his bed and into the warm comfort of his duvet.Too many things had happened today\u2014the recollection of his past memories, the meeting with Alicia, the arrival of the System, and the future plans he had made to deal with the danger surrounding him. Even an adult would be exhausted having to deal with so many matters at once, let alone a 9-year-old boy.Roel, having expended his mind and body today, quickly drifted off to dreamland.Meanwhile, Anna, who was just about to back out of the room, suddenly found herself musing over everything that had happened earlier in the day. She took another look at the adorable face of the little boy snoozing on the bed and recalled the changes that had happened to him.Affection Points +50!\u201cI guess I\u2019ll just stay for a while longer then.\u201dAnna muttered before leaving the room with quiet, nimble movements.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-A month later, in the farmlands located on the outskirts of Ascart City, a crowd had formed before the Fief Lord\u2019s Gristmill.Beneath the glaring sun, Old Kent was in the midst of tilling his field when he noticed the crowd gathering before the gristmill. He immediately tossed aside his hoe and pulled up his pants. With the tenacity of a ravenous tiger, he grabbed the bag of wheat by the side of the field and sprinted toward the gristmill with all his might. Along the way, he didn\u2019t forget to call out to his son too.\u201cBill, stop messing around with that darned donkey of yours! Hurry up and call your mum over to help me transport the crops. The gristmill has opened!\u201dOld Kent was more of a person of actions than words. He gave his son, who was feeding their donkey, a good kick on his bottom before continuing his charge toward the gristmill. It was not that Old Kent was an impatient person, but he had simply too many competitors vying with him.If one were to gaze down on the farmlands from the sky, one would see dozens of people sprinting frantically with bags of wheat in their hands toward the gristmill. They had different starting points\u2014some were closer than the others\u2014but if one thing was for certain, Old Kent wasn\u2019t in a very advantageous position.Son of a banshee! Isn\u2019t Old George supposed to be lame; how is he running that quickly? And that Anthony too! Your family doesn\u2019t have a lot of wheat anyway, so why are you running so hard for?Runner Old Kent surveyed the strong competitors in the race and frowned grimly. He realized that he would have to give it his all today, or else\u2026 he wouldn\u2019t be able to pay his taxes today!That\u2019s right! Old Kent, the lame Old George in front of him, Anthony on his left, and the dozens of others were fighting to pay their taxes!How did civilians pay their taxes in this world, you might ask? This usually complicated question had a very simple answer for those who work in the fields\u2014through handing over a portion of the crops they grew.It should go without saying they couldn\u2019t just hand over the crops that were freshly harvested from the field. No, these crops had to be processed first. The taxation process consisted of sending the wheat harvested to the Fief Lord\u2019s Gristmill to ground it down to flour. The tax officials would then take a portion of it away as tax before putting a tick beside the family\u2019s name.Had it been previous years, there would still have been people heading over to the Fief Lord\u2019s Gristmill during the harvesting season, but the queues would have definitely not been as long as this. But on this very year, all of the farmers ran with such desperation that anyone who didn\u2019t know better would have thought that the grim reaper was chasing them.The reason behind this difference was the newly appointed traveling tax official of the Ascart Fiefdom\u2014Roel Ascart.Roel Ascart, the young master and sole successor of the Ascart House, was only 9-year-old, so it couldn\u2019t be helped that Old Kent would snort in disdain when he heard that this little brat had become a tax official. He thought that the nobles were just toying around as usual, but soon, he heard some news that swiftly drove away his initial scorn.The news had come from the farmers who had bumped into Roel Ascart when they headed to the gristmill to pay their taxes, and it comprised two key pieces of information.First and foremost, when Roel Ascart was the tax official, the taxpaying farmers wouldn\u2019t have to turn the millstone themselves in the Fief Lord\u2019s Gristmill.In order to prevent farmers from underpaying their taxes, they were expected to grind their wheat down on the spot, and the millstone had to be turned manually. Those who were more well-off could bring their donkeys with them, but the issue was that their private donkeys were likely to then be used for public use.Words wouldn\u2019t be enough to describe just how tiring it was to turn the millstone manually with one\u2019s hands. Old Kent could complain about it for days on end!However, in the gristmill that Roel Ascart was collecting taxes from, everything was different. The farmers only had to hand their wheat over to the officials and wait by the side, and a while later, their wheat would magically turn into flour.It sounded too good to be true, but Old Kent didn\u2019t think that there was anything amiss about it. The old Marquess Carter was a renowned magician in the Saint Mesit Theocracy, so it went without saying that his son was bound to be a talented magician too. To the ordinary populace, there was simply nothing that magicians couldn\u2019t do.But that was not all. While the benefit of not having to turn the millstone manually was welcomed amongst the farmers, it was not enough to make the more well-to-do farmers, which included Old Kent himself, go crazy over it. What that really sent their old bones sprinting frantically was the next piece of information they heard.And that was that the taxes collected when Roel Ascart was on duty was actually less than usual!The farmers weren\u2019t educated, but they were streetwise. They were exceptionally calculative when it came to the payment of taxes.When Roel offered to grind the wheat down in their stead, the first thing that the farmers were worried about was that they would be overtaxed. The fact that they wouldn\u2019t be able to see the wheat getting ground into flour in person left them feeling a little uneasy.But after a series of careful calculations to figure out if they had been scammed, they arrived upon an astonishing conclusion\u2014instead of being overtaxed, they were being undertaxed instead!Based on the average of the estimates gathered from the farmers\u2019 calculation, they were undertaxed by more than 10%, some even close to 20%!As soon as the news got out, all of the farmers who hadn\u2019t paid their taxes up went completely red-eyed. A decrease of 20% in tax was a huge sum of money! Those crops saved could be sold in the capital and used to purchase plenty of good stuff. This was especially significant for well-to-do farmers like Old Kent.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe money Old Kent saved from the reduced tax would be enough to hold a decent wedding ceremony for his son!It was just a pity that Roel Ascart didn\u2019t have a fixed gristmill that he worked at, so it was impossible to predict where or when he would appear. Old Kent arrived late the previous time and ended up at the end of the queue, such that it wasn\u2019t even close to his turn when the gristmill closed at sunset.Just recalling about how aggrieved he felt then sent a spurt of energy racing through Old Kent\u2019s body, granting him the strength to outrun the lame Old George in the race to the Fief Lord\u2019s Gristmill.Meanwhile, at the forefront of the long queue before the gristmill, an adorable little boy was currently seated before a small round table, leisurely enjoying his afternoon tea. His gleaming golden eyes glanced at the farmers who were sprinting over with all their might, and a warm smile unfurled on his face.Affection Points +100! Affection Points +120! Affection Points +80!

    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 - Coach, I Want To Play BasketballPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 10: Coach, I Want To Play BasketballWhat kind of person was Roel Ascart?If someone were to ask the farmers of the Ascart Fiefdom this question a month ago, they would have surely laughed their heads off.Everyone knew that nobles of Roel Ascart\u2019s standing usually stayed in the most stately of mansions within the city. Even those living the city would struggle to catch a glimpse of him, let alone farmers living in the city outskirts like them.But a miracle occurred half a month ago. The young master of the marquess house actually lowered his pride to step onto the fields on the outskirts of town in order to visit the farmers, thus granting Old Kent and the others the rare opportunity to see him in person.And everyone\u2019s first response upon seeing Roel Ascart was all the same, and that was to take a second look. He was simply too good-looking, that\u2019s why.Roel\u2019s face was a lethal weapon in reaping Affection Points. Some said that he was cute, some said he was handsome; if the public had a list of desired features, Roel\u2019s face would certainly check them all. It wasn\u2019t long before rumors comparing Roel\u2019s looks to the beautiful elves of stories began spreading far and wide, making him the perfect lover budding young women who had just opened their eyes to the opposite gender dreamed of.The next thing that people noticed about Roel after his physical appearance was his attitude. From Old Kent\u2019s point of view, Roel Ascart was an earnest person who treated his subordinates with respect.It was nearing autumn now, so the weather had cooled down significantly. Nevertheless, the noon sun was still an adversary that ought to be feared. There was plenty of restless fidgeting amongst those queuing up, and even Old Kent himself couldn\u2019t help but feel irritated under such weather.Despite so, Roel Ascart was still able to maintain his poise. He didn\u2019t lash out at his subordinates; on the contrary, his attitude was even better than the usual tax officials that came down.Of course, as a noble, it went without saying that there was no way Roel Ascart would be exposed to the sun like the rest of them\u2014there was a servant holding an umbrella up to shelter him from the glaring sunlight\u2014but to be honest, it didn\u2019t make too much of a difference. On top of that, he had to maintain his spells in order to keep the millstone turning.From such a perspective, it would stand to reason that Roel Ascart would have been far more exhausted than the farmers, who were only standing in the queue.Thinking up to this point, the old farmers couldn\u2019t help but think in their minds:Young master Roel sure is a wonderful person!While Kent and the others were looking at Roel with looks of admiration, the latter was also looking at them\u2014with the green light popping up above their heads, of course\u2014feeling deeply moved too.What a wonderful harvest I\u2019m having here!A smile carrying earnest delight blossomed on Roel\u2019s face.Over the past month after recovering his past memories, Roel had managed to get used to his life here, and a series of elaborately designed self-salvation plans had also been put into motion.As someone who was in no way lacking in self-awareness, Roel knew deep well that he hadn\u2019t managed to triumph over his death flag yet. As a key boss in the common route of the game, Roel\u2019s conflict with the main character and his harem party ran far deeper than a single Alicia. While it was good news that he had managed to reconcile with Alicia, thus averting the future fate of being slain by the future Silverash Child, there was still a plethora of possible ways he could meet his end.Despite only being 9-year-old, Roel knew that he had to start working hard from now on if he wanted to ensure his survival, and the first step was to figure out how he could put the item he had obtained from the Affection Points Exchange Shop to good use.Half a month ago, Roel approached Marquess Carter for a talk, expressing his repentance over the tyrannical attitude he had put on thus far. He claimed that having Alicia as his stepsister had made him realize how lacking he was as a brother, so he decided to turn over a new leaf and become someone who could shoulder responsibility.After apologizing sincerely with a lowered head, he raised his head back up to seek Marquess Carter\u2019s opinions about what he should do next, only to recoil at the sight of the crying middle-aged man before him.There were few who could dispute that Marquess Carter was a highly successful individual, who was both a distinguished magician and one of the few high nobles in the Theocracy. Yet, there had been two thorns in Marquess Carter\u2019s heart all this while\u2014the premature death of his beloved wife, and his son\u2019s incompetence.A common hardship faced by single-parent families was the difficulty in expressing care and concern for the child during his growth, and that often led to many complications afterward. The situation was especially exacerbated in the Ascart House as Marquess Carter, as an important figure in the Theocracy, had a lot of work to deal with, leaving him with little time to accompany Roel. At the same time, he felt apologetic for Roel for having to grow up without his mother, so he tried to make up for it by doting on Roel. Ironically, his kind intention only further fueled Roel\u2019s tyranny.Roel became a selfish and domineering individual, never hesitating to scold and beat up the servants. Anyone with eyes could tell that he would eventually grow up to become a cruel fief lord.Marquess Carter wasn\u2019t blind to how Roel was becoming, and he was anxious about it too. But at the same time, he simply couldn\u2019t bear to harden his heart against the child he had with his deceased wife. In the end, he decided to adopt a similar-aged child in hopes of dispelling his son\u2019s loneliness and nudging him toward a more positive direction.Despite so, Marquess Carter didn\u2019t expect it to be so effective as to induce immediate changes in Roel!It went without saying that Marquess Carter was extremely excited to see such a development, but he knew that he mustn\u2019t get ahead of himself just yet. He would have to make sure to properly steer Roel in the right direction from now on so that he wouldn\u2019t go astray again.So, after a long moment of hesitation, he decided to reveal a fact to Roel first, and that was that\u2026 Roel didn\u2019t possess any talent as a magician at all!Marquess Carter also felt deeply helpless about this as well. Roel was already 9-year-old, but his study in spells was not going well at all. One must know that Marquess Carter was already a proper transcendent back when he was at this age! Compared to him, Roel was truly feeble.The inability to become a transcendent meant that it was unlikely for Roel to become a central figure of the Theocracy like Marquess Carter, but fortunately, that was not vital for a noble.Roel might not have been able to bring the Ascart House to greater heights, but he should at least be able to safeguard the family business for the next generation.As a father, Marquess Carter didn\u2019t have great ambitions for Roel. All he wished was for Roel to grow up happily and live a peaceful life. That was probably the same wish that most parents in the world had for their children.Little did Marquess Carter know that the many women whom Roel would eventually cross paths with had already ensured that peace would never become a part of his life.\u201cFather, are you saying that rather than studying magic spells, it would be better for me to focus on learning how to manage the fiefdom well instead?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. It\u2019s likely that the Ascart House might decline in your generation, but as long as you grit your teeth and push on, you\u2019ll eventually be able to make a turnaround.\u201dThe Ascart House was a lineage of distinguished magicians, such that there would be a highly talented magician offspring at least once every two generations. Marquess Carter only had one son, Roel, which meant that the next generation was already doomed. But even if he couldn\u2019t rely on his son, surely he could count on his grandson, right?\u201cFind a few more wives and make sure to have a lot of children. That\u2019ll increase the probability of you having an offspring strong enough to prop up our Ascart House.\u201dThe frank advice from Marquess Carter left Roel a little speechless. He could only be impressed by just how open-minded Marquess Carter was.But as ridiculous as those words sounded, Roel knew that Marquess Carter meant what he said. The continuance of a noble house\u2019s lineage was not to be made light of.So, Roel could only silently nod his head while feeling a little conflicted with the idea of becoming a wastrel who lived off his children.After going one huge round with his father, Roel felt that he had done enough padding, so he finally revealed his intention.\u201cFather, I\u2019m interested in the agriculture industry and the taxation of our fiefdom. May I request to temporarily take on the position of a taxation official so that I can see how the system works?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThat\u2019s a wonderful idea! Feel free to go ahead with it. As long as you wish to learn, I\u2019ll support you unconditionally!\u201dMarquess Roel, who had finally seen some hope in Roel, was afraid that Roel was just speaking on a whim and would soon change his mind, so he immediately got his subordinates to prepare the documents and stamped his approval on them within moments.Having achieved his goal, Roel thanked his father before looking at the documents in his hands with tears glistening in his eyes.My skeleton coolies can finally get to work now!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 11: My Friend, You\u2019re So Green\u201cMilord, thank you for your compassion. May the blessings of Sia be with you!\u201dOutside the Fief Lord\u2019s gristmill, Old Kent loaded his flour onto his carriage before bowing deeply in gratitude to Roel. Behind him was a huge queue of farmers, who were looking at him in envy.Old Kent was quite lucky today. It was already time for the taxation official to get off work when it finally got to his turn in the queue, but the generous and compassionate young master Roel noticed how he had laboriously toiled a huge cart of wheat over and had waited under the glaring sun for long hours, so he made a special exception and extended the operations by half an hour. Due to this stroke of fortune, Old Kent managed to pay his taxes today.One must know that Roel was a traveling tax official, which meant that there was no saying when they would be able to see him once more. Naturally, Old Kent was more than overjoyed with this turn of events, and the others were deeply envious of his luck too.\u201cIt isn\u2019t anything much. I\u2019m just getting off work a little later than usual. Make sure to prepare well for the onset of winter with the harvest you have made,\u201d Roel said with a warm smile as he gazed upon the green light glowing above Old Kent\u2019s head.Those words only made Old Kent feel even more moved, to the point that his head was glowing as green as a grass field.Seeing this sight, the smile on the face of the \u2018compassionate\u2019 Roel grew even brighter. In his mind, he gave himself a huge round of applause for having come up with such a brilliant plan.Kindness did play a part behind Roel\u2019s decision to extend operational hours and handle Old Kent\u2019s taxes, but what played a larger role behind that decision was the fact that Old Kent generated the most Affection Points for him during the earlier farmland marathon race, an astonishing 150 points!Roel was deeply shocked when he saw it.What marvelous harvest this is, glowing with such beautiful viridescent color! Even I\u2019d feel bad if I were to turn down such a huge gift!So, when Roel found that the person next in line was Old Kent, he decided to stay on for one last grand harvest. As could be seen from the overwhelming evidence, he had made the right decision. Old Kent had given him 300 Affection Points in one shot, rivaling the sum of three farmers!\u201cYoung master, it\u2019s getting late.\u201dThe soft whisper from a beautiful maid tickled Roel a little. Due to his shorter stature, Anna had to bend forward in order to whisper into his ears. As a result of that, when he turned his head over to look at her, he found himself staring straight into Anna\u2019s bountiful chest.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYoung master?\u201d\u201cCough cough, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dRoel didn\u2019t feel anything due to his young age, but his adult mind still felt a little embarrassed about it. He quickly adjusted his state of mind before standing up to enter the gristmill together with the unguarded Anna.Meanwhile, the other servants began packing up the table, chair, and tea set. The other farmers in the queue also sighed in disappointment.Roel did find it a pity to have not reaped the harvest that was already right before him, but as the saying went, \u2018haste makes waste\u2019. If he were to keep granting special privileges to the farmers without thinking it through, the farmers would simply take his service for granted. By then, the Affection Points he could earn from each individual would reduce significantly.After a month of analysis, Roel realized that the Affection Points System was more complicated than he had initially thought.Take Old Kent for example, the reason why he produced so many Affection Points was due to the relief of having barely been able to make it in for the tax collection, as well as the delight and sense of superiority derived from having a noble make a special exception just for him before everyone else.All of these factors played a huge role in generating the grand total of 300 Affection Points. However, if Roel had not chosen to wander amongst the gristmills but instead selected a specific one to work in, Old Kent would have still been grateful to him, but it would definitely not have been as much.Give a man a cup of rice, and he\u2019ll be thankful. Give a man a sack of rice, and he\u2019ll become dependent on you.To put it frankly, the key to earning Affection Points lay in hunger marketing. That being said, humans were complicated beings, such that there was no such thing as a sure-win strategy.With such thoughts in mind, Roel walked into the gristmill and saw six skeletons standing in a daze before the millstone. There was a black coffin placed by the side of the room, though it had already been cloaked white by a layer of flour.Indeed, this was the method that Roel thought of to recoup his 2500 Affection Points!The concept of sending the deceased away joyously with dancing skeleton pallbearers was simply too revolutionary, such that it was impossible to even fathom that anyone in the Ascart Fiefdom would enjoy it, so earning gold coins through that was out of the question. That being said, it would still be wonderful if he could recoup his Affection Points somehow.So, he found the skeletons, who were good for nothing except for their stamina, a job that they could do\u2014coolie work.The combined strength of the 6 F+ skeletons was at least enough to compete with a donkey, so pushing the millstone posed no issue for them. It just so happened that the coffin was a good way to transport the flour around too.All the skeletons had to do was to dump the flour inside the coffin outside the gristmill once it got full, and the other servants would pack them up properly and load them onto thesecondcarriage.Roel directed a nod of approval toward the six skeletons, thinking that they were at least good for something now. Then, with a snap of his finger, the skeletons swiftly folded themselves tightly and fitted themselves into the coffin.The attitude that the Saint Mesit Theocracy had toward the undead was one of silent approval. It was said that the undead had already existed ever since the First Epoch, so the Theocracy had nothing against the undead. As long as a magician controlling the undead didn\u2019t flout any laws of the country, no action would be taken against him.That being said, the sudden appearance of a few racks of skeletons would still cause great panic amongst the people, so Roel couldn\u2019t just allow his skeletons to run rampant. For that reason, he usually first stowed his skeletons inside the black coffin before transporting them from place to place.Roel also knew that it would be impossible to hide them from his servants in the long-run, so he claimed that the Skeleton Pallbearer Army was a treasure stowed away in the vault of the Ascart House. There were quite a few old relics inside the vault anyway, such that even Marquess Carter couldn\u2019t say for sure whether it had really been in there or not.Ahh, being from a house of magicians sure is convenient!Roel stretched his back lazily as he walked out of the gristmill. Some of the guards quickly marched into the gristmill to carry the coffin out and load it onto thesecondcarriage. As for what thefirstcarriage was, it went without saying that it was a luxurious transportation carriage reserved specially for the esteemed marquess\u2019 son!Under the cheers of the farmers, Roel got onto his luxurious carriage and sunk his little body into the comfy sofa. Anna also followed him into the carriage and sat down on the chair opposite to him. The door to the carriage closed, and the coach began driving the carriage forward.Sitting in front of the Fief Lord\u2019s gristmill and supervising the taxation process was the kind of work that looked deceptively easy but was actually incredibly tiring. Putting aside the sweltering weather, Roel had to constantly maintain a dignified sitting position before the farmers, and that was more than enough to wear his weak body down.After a long day of work, the exhausted Roel was finally able to rest a little. His muscles, which had stiffened up from long hours of staying stationary, gradually eased up little by little.\u201cAhhhh, I\u2019m going to die if I don\u2019t recharge a little from Alicia later on\u2026\u201dRoel muttered with a blank look in his eyes, causing Anna, who had heard her fair share of bizarre words from him recently, to blink her eyes in confusion.\u201cDoes young master miss Miss Alicia? You\u2019ll be able to meet her in a moment\u2019s time. She should be waiting at the main entrance for you to return.\u201dAnna thought about the silver-haired girl who had been waiting at the entrance of the Ascart House every evening the last few days, and a knowing adult smile formed on her lips. She couldn\u2019t help but think that youth was such a great thing.On the other hand, Roel\u2019s spirits lifted a little upon hearing Anna\u2019s words as he prepared himself to receive the biggest harvest of Affection Points for the day.With a look of anticipation on the little boy\u2019s face, the luxurious carriage finally made its way through the gates of the marquess\u2019 mansion. At the moment that Roel alighted from the carriage, Alicia\u2019s promised sweet voice sounded in the air.\u201cWelcome back, big brother Roel!\u201d\u2014Give a man a cup of rice, and he\u2019ll be thankful. Give a man a sack of rice, and he\u2019ll become dependent on you.This is a saying that if you keep on helping a person, he\u2019ll take things for granted, such that when you eventually decide to stop helping him, he\u2019ll turn around and blame you instead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 12: Sorry, We Just Want To See The Ships Set SailIf one were to ask when Roel was the happiest each day, the answer would certainly be right now.At the entrance of the mansion stood a silver-haired girl with arms spread wide. She hugged her brother, who had just returned from an exhausting day at his internship. Her slightly shy demeanor and exquisite looks formed great chemistry, producing an irresistible charm that drew others in.\u201cI\u2019m back, Alicia.\u201dFeeling a bit gleeful from receiving the slightly awkward little girl\u2019s sweet hug, Roel reciprocated by returning the hug while patting her head dotingly.As things would have it, Roel had a role to play in Alicia\u2019s current reaction.It was not too hard to imagine that Alicia was far from the kind of person who would actively hug others. She had a reticent and composed nature, and her family had brought her up to be a well-mannered and graceful lady. Other than her deceased father, she had never hugged anyone else before.But her cool demeanor was met with Roel\u2019s warmth. Every time he returned from work, he would greet this little girl with a warm hug. At the start, Alicia would stiffen up under his embrace, suffering from the culture shock. As time went by though, she gradually grew used to it, and in the recent two days, she even began to hug Roel on her own accord.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 1 day agoUnder Roel\u2019s influence, she was gradually becoming more proactive in expressing herself. Roel felt that this was one of the two important signs that Alicia was starting to accept him, the other one being how Alicia was addressing him right now.\u201cBig brother Roel, it\u2019s itchy. Hahaha!\u201dRoel mischievously blew at Alicia\u2019s neck, tickling her a little. Under his attack, the little girl who had matured earlier than her age ended up breaking out in laughter.Alicia changed the way she addressed Roel around a week after their first meeting. It was bound to happen given how quickly they grew closer to one another. However, it was only when no outsiders were around that she would address Roel as \u2018big brother\u2019; on other occasions, she would go with a more formal \u2018Lord Brother\u2019.In any case, these changes were a good sign as it showed that Alicia was slowly beginning to open up.\u201cMy apologies. Did you dislike it?\u201d\u201cN-no, that\u2019s not it.\u201dHearing Roel\u2019s concerned question, Alicia quickly shook her head, her shimmering silver hair swaying along with the movement. Her desire for warmth instinctively drew her to Roel, and after a moment of hesitation, she carefully buried her face into Roel\u2019s shoulders.Just like that, the two children continued hugging one another. The maids around couldn\u2019t stop themselves from smiling upon seeing this sight, and the green light of Affection Points glowed above their heads.The young master and miss are as close as always~As someone who had witnessed how the relationship between the two children slowly developed ever since their first meeting, Anna was the de facto captain of the \u2018Roel X Anna Ship\u2019, and she prayed fervently with all her heart that this ship would eventually set sail.Roel took a discreet glance at the green light around him, pausing for a while, before finally and reluctantly parting with the adorable Alicia. It had been a while since this bizarre phenomenon started, but for some inexplicable reason, every single time he doted on Alicia, the nearby maids would suddenly release a wave of Affection Points for him.What was even more astonishing to him was that the amounts they were giving out were steadily growing over time!This had been a shocking discovery to Roel. As baffled as he was by this occurrence, he welcomed it with all his heart. After all, this meant that he was able to harvest some extra income from the side mobs on top of the main boss.That all being said, Roel wasn\u2019t just getting close to Alicia for the sake of earning Affection Points. This was also necessary to protect her.Based on the information he had gathered from the game in his previous life, Alicia\u2019s fate was intricately linked with the Ascart House and Roel. In fact, one of the tragedies that happened to Alicia later in the game was that she got sold by Roel in exchange for some sort of benefit that was required for the declining Ascart House to remain afloat.While there was no way the current Roel would do anything like that, he still felt a little uneasy about the matter, especially since he was unsure of the exact circumstances surrounding that event. There could have been some sort of extenuating circumstances at play then.In order to completely eliminate the chances of that event occurring, he would have to earn enough Affection Points and prevent the decline of the Ascart House. This way, Alicia wouldn\u2019t have to go through that tragedy, while Roel would be able to avoid his death flag too.Was there a more justifiable reason than this to get close to a cute girl like Alicia?\u201cIt\u2019s getting late now. Let\u2019s head over to the dining room to eat.\u201d\u201cYes, big brother Roel.\u201d\u201cWhat did you do today?\u201d\u201cIn the morning, I had etiquette lessons with Viscountess Heffen. In the afternoon, I had literature, history, and math lessons. After that, I spent my day reading in the study room until evening.\u201dHm? She\u2019s actually so hardworking?A certain incompetent young master faltered a little upon hearing Alicia\u2019s words, and a sense of shame rushed through him.Nobles did enjoy privileged lives, but they weren\u2019t like the nouveau riche who indulge themselves in decadent pleasure. Every single noble carried a heavy responsibility on their shoulders\u2014to prepare the next generation to shoulder the pride and glory of their respective houses and to carry the mission on to the next generation\u2014so that their houses could continue and prosper.After years of trial and error, they concluded that the best way to do so was through education.Education was the key to producing elites capable of fulfilling the responsibilities they were entrusted with. Hierarchy was reinforced by education, too.The Ascart House, as a long-standing noble house, pulled no stops when it came to the education of its younger generation. The teachers that were brought in were all distinguished figures in the Holy Capital, and the assignments they gave out were also known for their difficulty.Of course, it was totally tyrant Roel\u2019s style to disregard his teachers and toss aside his assignments, but Alicia was not the kind of person to do that. Despite the huge workload she already had from her studies, she still persisted in reading during her free time too.Wasn\u2019t this too much for a 7-year-old child to bear?\u201cAlicia, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re motivated to study, but you mustn\u2019t tire yourself out. You can slowly take your time; there\u2019s no rush.\u201d\u201c\u2026 That won\u2019t do.\u201d\u201cHm? Why is that so?\u201d\u201c\u2026 If I don\u2019t work hard now, I won\u2019t be able to catch up with big brother Roel.\u201dAlicia revealed her motive meekly. She was currently younger by Roel by two years, so if she were to continue her studying at a normal pace, she would never be able to catch up with Roel\u2019s progress. That would mean that they would never get to attend the same classes.That, in turn, meant that they could only meet each other for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, significantly reducing the time they had together. That was not something that Alicia could tolerate.Studying was dry and monotonous, but this little wish of hers gave her the drive to work diligently every single day. This train of thoughts seemed so natural to her that she didn\u2019t even notice how attached she was becoming to this brother of hers whom she had only known for a month.\u201cIs that so? But I recall that the teachers assign quite a lot of assignments. I would usually have to work on them till nighttime.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably because big brother Roel is learning more advanced content. I\u2019m only on the third volume for math. The content is relatively easier, so I\u2019m able to finish the assignments quite quickly..\u201d\u201cIs that so? You\u2019re only on the third volume\u2026 Hm?\u201dRoel\u2019s footsteps suddenly halted on the spot as he replayed what Alicia had just said in his mind. Following that, his golden eyes slowly began to widen.Wait a moment, the third volume in math? But I\u2019m pretty sure that I\u2019m only on the second volume right now!1 reply\u00a0\u2013 1 day agoRoel suddenly remembered how he had never attended classes seriously and would often write all sorts of nonsense for his assignments. Due to that, he had already spent more than a year learning the second volume, which was not difficult at all. Otherwise, he should have already been on the fourth volume by now.With this, Roel was forced to acknowledge the cruel reality that his studies were actually behind Alicia, his junior by two years\u2026 and it seemed like she did it easily at that!Thinking back on the game, Roel suddenly recalled that Alicia was known for her excellent results in the academy too!Argh! A beautiful appearance, smart mind, and monstrously powerful bloodline; just what in the world was this perfect being?! Had it been the other Roel, he would have surely developed a sense of inferiority against her!Roel suddenly felt like he had found the reason why the original Roel had ended up oppressing Alicia, treating her with great hostility. As a person who was not very high on the intelligence stat, having to face the seemingly perfect Alicia and be reminded of his inadequacies every single day, it probably heaped a mountain load of stress on him.To actually be lagging behind a person who looked up to him, onlookers would have laughed at the plight that Roel was in\u2026No, they really were laughing at him.(Affection Points +20! Affection Points +30! Affection Points +15\u2026)Indeed. Despite the dignified and respectful facade of these maids, they were all laughing at Roel at this very moment in their minds\u2014the strained looks on their faces were more than enough to prove that! They knew Roel\u2019s current progress in his studies, after all.\u201cPft!\u201dAnna, who didn\u2019t fear her young master as much anymore after spending the past month together, accidentally let a laugh slip out, but it was quickly stifled by Roel\u2019s sharp glare.Nevertheless, she was still deeply looking forward to the soon-to-come reversal of roles, where Alicia would become the one tutoring Roel on his studies instead.It sure is heartening to see the young master and young miss getting along well!Setting aside the maids\u2019 antics, it was just a pity that Roel wasn\u2019t going to let the old script play out that way anymore, and he had the capability to do it. He was no longer his past self!It\u2019s lucky that math was my strong suit back on Earth, or else I might have really been done in here!, Roel thought as he continued proceeding ahead.Marquess Carter wasn\u2019t at home today either, so the kitchen staff was waiting for Roel to return before starting the preparations for dinner. As soon as the news of Roel\u2019s return was relayed via the guards, the kitchen immediately got to work.In the dining room, the little boy and girl sat side-by-side\u2014Roel had already received formal approval from Marquess Carter regarding this arrangement. Feeding Alicia every day was a huge project for him, so he couldn\u2019t allow anything to go wrong! That being said, he had relented on slicing the meat in view of his young age, now entrusting the task to the trusty servants. The only responsibility he had was to feed Alicia.Roel and Alicia chatted at the dining table as they waited for dinner to come, but surprisingly, a piece of news arrived first.\u201cYoung master, the old master has sent news that he\u2019ll be returning tomorrow with a guest.\u201dThe news was passed through several people, and in the end, it was Anna who stepped forward with a lowered head to inform Roel. The latter blinked in surprise upon hearing the news.A guest?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So fast?Roel was surprised because he didn\u2019t think that Marquess Carter would get a break all of a sudden. He subconsciously stroked his lower jaw contemplatively, seemingly emulating the gestures of old scholars in the Country of Academics, Brolne.Amused by the sight of an elderly gesture on the little boy, the watching servants couldn\u2019t help but chuckle a little.For Marquess Carter, a noble of the Saint Mesit Theocracy, the concept of fixed workdays didn\u2019t exist. Who could possibly force someone of his standing to work? That being said, as the Chief Magician of the Holy Knight Order, Marquess Carter could be considered a military man, and he was responsible for researching new spells and training his subordinates.The key behind the continued prosperity of the Ascart House lay in its deep-rooted connections with the military. The presence of talented magicians in its lineage allowed its influence to permeate the military. In fact, if one were to trace a few generations up the lineage, there were even some from the Ascart House who had risen to the very top of the military.As such, Marquess Carter often spent his time with the knights, choosing to entrust the management of the fiefdom to the officials under him. He would only return for three to five days per month to conduct a routine inspection and hold meetings to set a direction for the fiefdom\u2019s development.Needless to say, this was also the reason why Roel grew up without any family members, and Marquess Carter felt deeply guilty about it.Roel did a quick calculation, it had only been half a month since his father last departed. It was peculiar that he was returning so quickly and for him to bring a guest back with him too\u2026One should know that those qualified to become guests of the Ascart House were no minor figures. At the very least, they had to be a noble of at least viscount rank for Marquess Carter to take the trouble to inform the mansion in advance. His underlying meaning was \u2018It\u2019s a VIP, so prepare yourselves!\u2019.Roel couldn\u2019t help but wonder just who it could be.He earnestly thought about it for a while, and in the end\u2026 he decided to dig into his dinner instead.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 7 hours agoIt couldn\u2019t be helped that there were only so many people he knew! Rather than let his mind wander aimlessly, he might as well do something useful like filling his belly and earning some Affection Points!\u201cCome, Alicia. Ahhh\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cGlomp!\u201d1 reply\u00a0\u2013 7 hours ago\u201cWhat a good girl. How does it taste? I told the chef to add a little more sugar, so it shouldn\u2019t be too sour this time.\u201d\u201cMm, it tastes much better than before. Thank you, big brother Roel.\u201dAlicia raised her head up and revealed a sweet smile. Her sparkling ruby eyes looked as if the rays of the morning sun were concealed within their depths, tempting others to gaze within.Ahhhhh! How adorable! I\u2019m really going to die from this one day!Roel had to give his all to resist the urge to rush forward and give this adorable little sister a tight hug. With effort, he kept his composure, picked up a napkin, and gently wiped away sauce that had gotten on the corners of Alicia\u2019s mouth. The little girl\u2019s eyes narrowed on touch, reminiscent of a little cat being spoiled by its owner.This job should have been done by the servants, but the servants were not people who didn\u2019t know how to read the mood. They chose to stay put in their position and watch the interactions of the little duo with slight smiles\u2026 though Anna\u2019s gleaming eyes were a little hard to bear.Such sweetness for my eyes to feast on everyday!Over the past month, Alicia\u2019s standing in the Ascart House had risen swiftly. From an adopted daughter from a baron house, she was now viewed by the servants as the future matriarch of the Ascart House.The interactions between Roel and Alicia did play a huge part in that, but the decisive factor was actually the unintentional result of that conversation between Roel and Marquess Carter.That heart-to-heart talk between father and son had not only allowed Roel to achieve his motive, it had also brought about some unintended side effects, including a change in how his father treated Alicia.After learning that his \u2018using-another-similar-aged-child-to-guide-my-wayward-son-back-to-the-proper-path\u2019 stratagem was a resounding success, Marquess Carter was deeply thankful to Alicia. He began doting on her all the more. While it was his gratitude that motivated this change in behavior, it was taken very differently by the servants of the house.The old master indeed favors Alicia! He\u2019s intending to have the young master wed her in order to ensure the continuance of the Ascart lineage!Such rumors had already spread far and wide within the manor, and Roel\u2019s actions only served to affirm it. The \u2018Roel X Alicia Ship\u2019 had been expanding at an astonishing pace, providing a massive source of Affection Points for Roel.On the one hand, the sweet childhood tale of romance between those two highly attractive individuals proved to be extremely popular amongst the slightly older maids, and on the other, any servant would prefer someone whom they had known from a young age to become the future matriarch of the Ascart House, rather than take their chances with an unknown stranger from elsewhere.Well done, young master! Snatch Miss Alicia\u2019s heart over with your charms, and our Ascart House will be set for the future!Anna clasped her fists tightly before her chest as she cheered for Roel inside her heart.Roel\u2019s train of thoughts, however, was completely different from hers.It was simply too much to think that a 9-year-old and a 7-year-old would really understand what romantic love was. Even Roel, a past adult, had no feelings toward boy-girl relationships at the moment due to his undeveloped body. He only doted on Alicia because he thought that the latter was simply too cute; she was the chicken soup that healed his exhausted soul.After feeding Alicia, Roel also quickly cleared his food too. Since the two of them weren\u2019t able to spend time together earlier in the day, they decided to make up for it after dinner. Marquess Carter wasn\u2019t around at the moment. With no one to keep them on schedule, they could stay up as long as they liked!That being said, their young bodies still tired out very quickly. By the time the clock struck eight, Roel and Alicia had already retired to their rooms.But here came the question\u2014what did Roel and Alicia do together in the period of time after their dinner and before their bedtime?Due to the exorbitant price of nighttime illumination, most commoners would simply opt to have a relaxing cup of tea or a conversation with their loved ones before heading off to bed. As for whether there would be any additional activities in the bed, that would be up to the individual.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 6 hours agoBut for nobles, their nighttime activities were far more extensive than that. Since money wasn\u2019t a problem, there were many things that they could do, such as playing chess or reading books. Those who embraced their artistic side might opt to dance or play some music. When there were more people around, they might even choose to hold a \u2018moon-gazing party\u2019.Alicia and Roel would usually spend their time together chatting or reading books, but due to their prior conversation about their studies, inevitably, the topic headed that direction.\u201cBig brother Roel, I\u2019m having trouble solving this problem. Can you teach me?\u201dThe moment Alicia took out her assignment and consulted Roel, the room suddenly plunged into an unnatural silence. The servants, who were still cheering for Roel a moment ago, suddenly froze on the spot. Even the professional Anna was caught off guard and failed to conceal her shock in time.Is there where it all comes crashing down?Anna, as Roel\u2019s personal maid, knew about his current progress with his studies better than anyone else. Given that Roel was lagging behind Alicia at the moment, how could he possibly solve the latter\u2019s problem?In the face of this crisis, Anna stood forward and interjected.\u201cMiss, our young master had a busy day supervising the taxation process, so I fear that\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201dTo the horror of the servants, Roel rejected Anna\u2019s timely assistance. He elegantly snapped-up Alicia\u2019s assignment before looking at the latter with a confident smile.\u201cWhich part are you having trouble with? I\u2019ll teach you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(It Isn\u2019t)What is the key to winning a woman\u2019s heart?This was a universal problem that had confounded countless men since the dawn of mankind. It was like a philosophical question, where every single person had a unique answer.Some women indulge themselves in beauty, seeking out an attractive partner to spend their lives with. Some women value culture, demanding their other half to be romantic and talented. However, to children still caught in their studies, the greatest mark of success was often examination results. They tend to look up to their smarter peers with rose-tinted glasses, influencing their perception of the latter.Alicia was a child who had matured early, due to her past experiences, experiences which resulted in her having her own unique perspective regarding the world. A perspective which, while not necessarily a bad thing, resulted in her being unable to fit in with her peers, becoming estranged. Not even Roel, who had opened her heart, could change the girl\u2019s independent nature.That was why she desired to prove herself through her studies, so that she could receive everyone\u2019s acknowledgment. And right now, she desires one person\u2019s acknowledgment more than anyone else\u2019s in the world.Roel\u2019s.On the study desk, Alicia watched how the black-haired boy sitting next to her calculated out an entire page worth of sums, and her eyes twinkled in admiration.It didn\u2019t surprise her that Roel was able to solve the problem she had stumbled over easily; after all, she had already thought that this big brother was ahead of her in his studies. However, what Roel then proceeded to do made her realize just how vast the gap between them was.Not only did Roel explain the method of solving the problem to her in a concise manner, but he even went through the rest of Alicia\u2019s assignment to check for any errors\u2014and he did so by calculating all of the sums on the spot.\u201cBig brother Roel, how are you able to calculate so quickly?\u201d asked Alicia in a mixture of shock and awe.After all, Roel had managed to work out all of the problems in just ten minutes when she had already spent more than half an hour on them.Hearing Alicia\u2019s question, Roel put down his pen before gazing at the questions before him, a pensive look on his face.\u201cRegarding this\u2026\u201dYou\u2019d have been able to do it as quickly as me if you could recite the multiplication table too\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu1 reply\u00a0\u2013 7 hours agoRoel chuckled lightly to himself.\u201cThere\u2019s a small trick to it. I\u2019ll show you later.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201dWitnessing Alicia\u2019s sweet smile and the massive influx of Affection Points he had just received, Roel couldn\u2019t help but smile to himself too. He casually turned around to glance at the utterly flabbergasted Anna, and a smug smile emerged on his lips.Heh, looks like I\u2019ve managed to preserve my dignity!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013The following morning, Roel woke up early and had breakfast together with Alicia. The two didn\u2019t follow the usual routine of sticking close together. Rather, they quickly finished their meals before heading back to their rooms to prepare for the day\u2019s events.This was all because an esteemed guest was visiting today.The servants hadn\u2019t just shrugged off the message from Marquess Carter either. They\u2019d worked through the night to ensure that the Ascart House was ready to host their guest. The change was so great that Roel nearly thought he had been kidnapped to somewhere else when he first emerged from his bedroom.On top of ensuring that the entire place was spick and span, the servants also changed the carpets, put up paintings, and took out the valuable antiques that had been stowed away in storage\u2014placing them on display in the study room, along the corridors, and other prominent locations.To conclude, it was as if they were preparing for Christmas.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 7 hours agoIt goes without saying that the stars of the show, Roel and Alicia, couldn\u2019t just dress casually, the way they normally did, especially so for Roel. As the sole son and heir of the Ascart House, he had to play the part.\u201cYoung master, please don\u2019t move around.\u201dBack in his room, Anna was squatting before Roel, tidying up his eyebrows for him. For the sake of appearances, Roel had to have a touch of makeup applied, improving his already handsome face slightly, though it wasn\u2019t the same kind of makeup that was used back on Earth.\u201cAlright, young master. Please close your eyes now.\u201dAfter applying a razor to Roel\u2019s eyebrows, Anna next picked up a small brush and dabbed it inside a jade bottle filled with some sort of transparent fluid before carefully applying it to Roel\u2019s face. It felt refreshingly cool against his skin.When Roel finally opened his eyes once more, he was shocked by what he saw. It was almost as if he was looking at himself through a camera\u2019s beautifying filter.Holy moly. I look dashing!He lightly touched his lower jaw as he examined the handsome lad inside the mirror. Dropping his gaze, he eyed the jade bottle and its contents of transparent liquid. Demon Dew.Rumor had it that the main ingredient of Demon Dew was a resin gathered from the tree demons of the Lost Forest. It was an exclusive product sold by the Sorofya Merchant Association. From the moment it appeared on the market, it became an ultra-luxury product that innumerable noblewomen scrambled to get their hands on.A single droplet for unblemished skin, five droplets for a complete makeover; it was nearly as amazing as plastic surgery!That being said, its effects were temporary and wouldn\u2019t work against magicians that boasted high mana, such as Marquess Carter, since they would be able to easily see through such a low level beguilement.On top of that, Demon Dew was not all good either. All of the mana-infused products of this world had some side effects. If one were to use the product too frequently, it could place a \u2018Charm\u2019 effect on one\u2019s face. There was an incident where a noblewoman found herself attacked by a fanatic stalker after she overused Demon Dew.Despite the downsides, the product still remained the favorite of noblewomen. Just a small bottle would cost dozens of gold coins.While admiring his good looks in the mirror, Roel suddenly thought of something, so he turned around and asked Anna a question.\u201cIs there Demon Dew over at Alicia\u2019s side too?\u201d\u201cYoung master, please rest easy. We have made sure to prepare some for Miss Alicia too.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dRoel nodded his head calmly, only to notice some unexpected Affection Points coming from Anna.This is weird, why is Anna giving me Affection Points? I didn\u2019t do anything at all\u2026 Oh wait, I get it now!Roel smacked his fist against his palm in realization, as he felt like he had stumbled upon the truth.It must be due to my good looks! Ahh, what a sinful person I am!1 reply\u00a0\u2013 7 hours agoThe little boy sighed to himself as he placed all blame on his splendid appearance.Meanwhile, Anna\u2019s thoughts were, of course, going off on a tangent to what Roel was thinking about.Young master sure dotes on Miss Alicia a lot. Despite his young age, he\u2019s already showing so much consideration for her!The sudden bout of shipping induced a huge stream of Affection Points from Anna, which greatly boosted Roel\u2019s ego and confidence, thanks to his own misperceptions.Half a minute later, Roel finally tore his eyes away from the mirror and walked out of the room wearing a fitted suit. Just as he was walking down the left side of the central staircase, heading to the lounge, he noticed a silver-haired figure walking toward him from the right side of the central staircase.Alicia was wearing a white banquet dress that was looser at the top and bottom but tightened around her slender waist. Her silver hair had been put up neatly, leaving just a few strands of it hanging by the side of her face. The effect of the Demon Dew had bestowed a touch of seductiveness to her delicate features, making her appear like a ravishing figure who had walked out from a painting.That was not all. Those crimson eyes became the final note, the missing piece, to create a striking contrast with Alicia\u2019s fair complexion, white dress, and silver hair; it was reminiscent of a blazing inferno in the midst of a snowy mountain. When all the elements harmonized together, it was hard for one\u2019s heart not to pound in her presence.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 6 hours agoUpon sighting Alicia, his footsteps halted and Roel fell into a daze for a good two seconds. The servants around him couldn\u2019t help but make a sharp intake of breath themselves. Following that, a hushed, excited discussion broke out amongst the servants, filling the silent lounge with life.What breathtaking beauty! How can anyone ever resist this?Roel snapped out of his daze and quickly reached for his nostrils to check if he was bleeding. Confirming there were no problems, he hurriedly averted his gaze from Alicia and continued heading down the stairs.Wow, I\u2019m really going to die at this rate. Her fighting prowess is way too strong!Roel\u2019s thoughts raced as he continued his descent. He was too affected by the sight of Alicia that he failed to notice the girl\u2019s return reaction.In the instant that Alicia caught sight of the dressed up Roel, her body froze up. Her crimson eyes slowly widened as a tinge of red swiftly rippled over her face. Her heart began beating so quickly that it was actually starting to hurt a little.Big brother Roel is so handsome\u2026Realizing that her breathing was starting to become a little chaotic, Alicia quickly averted her eyes. She felt like the boy before her was wrapped in a natural radiance that she couldn\u2019t bear to look straight at. She lowered her head and clutched the sides of her dress nervously.\u201cMiss, you can do it!\u201dThe whisper of support from a maid behind her snapped Alicia out of her daze. She walked down the stairs over to Roel\u2019s side before timidly raising her head, only to find herself meeting with Roel\u2019s eyes.A moment of silence lingered between the two before they averted their eyes simultaneously and speedily.\u201cL-lord Brother, you look spirited today!\u201d\u201cYes, the same goes for you too. You look\u2026 beautiful.\u201dThe little duo stood side by side with reddened faces, feeling inexplicably embarrassed about the situation. Meanwhile, the army of servants following behind was feasting their eyes at this rare sight.How adorable! I would have no regrets even if I were to die now! Argh, just when is the young master going to marry the young miss?\u201cAnna, your expression, your expression!\u201dThe nearby servants quickly tugged at Anna to remind her to rein in that bizarre smile on her face. It was in the midst of this slightly pink atmosphere of budding romance that the doors to the marquess house suddenly opened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - Angel\u2019s BloodlinePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15: Angel\u2019s BloodlineThe rumbling of a carriage could be heard from beyond the door. Faces still red, Roel and Alicia quickly pulled themselves together, and the excited Anna reined her emotions in. The romantic mood that had built-up popped like a bubble, replaced by solemnity.Roel spied outside the door with narrowed eyes and saw an exquisite noble carriage slowly pulling into the courtyard.Clip clop clip clop!The rhythmic clattering of hooves echoed crisply, and the sound was surprisingly calming in this tense atmosphere. The appearance of the white steed, however, made Roel\u2019s pupils contract a little.Frostwing Horse, the hybrid between the mystical pegasus and unicorn. It was a beast of noble birth, and there were very few of them in this world. It was usually impossible to see them outside of the Holy Capital\u2014and most people wouldn\u2019t really think of rearing one either.Frostwing Horses had exceptional specs, far surpassing that of other steeds, but its temper was terrible due to its noble blood.Pegasii were beings of legend, known to be the steed of angels; whereas unicorns were licentious bastards who only allowed the purest of maidens to ride upon them. Legends spoke that the Frostwing Horses had once pledged their allegiance to the High Elves under one unbelievably shameless condition, \u2018Fulfill all of our demands.\u2019That\u2019s right. They wanted everything!They demanded those with the bloodline of angels; they demanded the purest of maidens; there was no end to their demands!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu2 replies\u00a0\u2013 5 hours agoThey prided themselves on possessing the bloodline of two mythical creatures, but the truth was that they matched neither the pegasus nor the unicorn. While it might be possible for them to awaken both bloodlines to their purest form, becoming the greatest steed in the world with the powers of both mythical creatures combined, but that existed only in theory. To date, no one has ever seen such a formidable Frostwing Horse.That being said, there weren\u2019t many houses that could afford to use them as carriage horses; or to be more exact, there was only one house that was able to do so.Upon realizing this fact, Roel\u2019s body stiffened up. He lifted his gaze to take a look and saw the conspicuous emblem displayed on the side of the carriage. It was an insignia emblazoned with an impenetrable shield sporting two intersecting wings, named the Guardian of Radiant Wings.This insignia was unique to a house within the Saint Mesit Theocracy, namely the royal family\u2014the Xeclydes.As the name, Saint Mesit Theocracy, suggested, it was a country in which politics and religion were intertwined. The head of the Xeclyde House was both emperor to the country and pope to the church. He headed the Genesis Goddess Church, which worshipped the Goddess of Creation, Sia.The Genesis Goddess Church boasted the greatest religious following in this world, its believers spread across the entire human territory, and its influence comparable to that of Earth\u2019s Roman Catholic Church in Italy. The church\u2019s teachings profoundly impacted its followers\u2019 way of life.A single house commanded unquestionable authority over this massive religion with uncountable followers, and that was the Xeclydes.Typically speaking, there should have been no way a single house could have swallowed this humongous pie on its own. There were bound to be ambitious and power-hungry organizations who wanted a slice of their own, possibly demanding for the pope position to be rotated amongst major powers or for greater distribution of power over the religion.But as the situation would have it, the Xeclydes managed to maintain a tight hold over the Genesis Goddess Church for the past thousand years, and there was only one reason for that\u2014the Xyclydes had inherited the Angel\u2019s Bloodline.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 8 hours agoAngels were known to have assisted Sia during the First Epoch, and they were said to be the race closest to the gods. Was there anyone in the world who was more qualified to lead the religion worshipping Sia than the descendants of angels?As important as legitimacy was, it was just the icing on the cake. Legitimacy wasn\u2019t sufficient to safeguard anything for a thousand years. The key to the Xeclydes\u2019 continued dominance was something far more crude\u2014sheer power.In this world, bloodlines weren\u2019t just good for boasting who and who were your father and grandfather. No, they were real symbols of power. There were many variations to the Angel\u2019s Bloodline, but one thing for certain was that this bloodline was guaranteed to be Gold-tier as long as one was able to awaken it.That was more than enough to guarantee the succession of their lineage. Anyone who was reincarnated into that family would be able to enjoy a life of predestined success, as if a protagonist of a novel.Ey, how lucky.Roel thought as he hurriedly took off the Emblem of Glory pinned in front of his chest.\u201cLord Brother?\u201dAlicia blinked her eyes in surprise at Roel\u2019s movement.However, there was no time to talk. The carriage had already come to a halt, and the servants rushed forth to open the golden carriage doors. Three people stepped out from within.The first was Roel\u2019s father, Marquess Carter.The second was a golden-haired man with a massive body and a solemn face.The third was a young girl.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cWelcome, Your Highness Kane. I am Roel Ascart. I have long since heard of your brave exploits from my father, and it is my honor to be able to meet you today.\u201d1 reply\u00a0\u2013 7 hours agoAt the foyer of the mansion, Roel greeted the golden-haired man as he directed huge eyes twinkling with the innocent admiration of a child toward him. His acting was near perfect, such that no one would have been able to pick a flaw with it.Marquess Carter was a little stunned to see Roel acting in such an abnormal fashion, but the golden-haired man beside him burst into hearty laughter.\u201cHahaha, Carter. I didn\u2019t think that a fellow like you would actually spout good things about me!\u201dThe commander of the Holy Knights Order, Kane Xeclyde, was flattered by Roel\u2019s words. He hadn\u2019t thought that Chief Magician Carter, who often raised opposition toward his suggestions, would actually praise him before his child.Looking at the beaming admiration on Roel\u2019s earnest face, Kane couldn\u2019t raise the slightest doubt toward the latter at all.While Roel, as a noble, was expected to be able to speak pleasantries, he was also at an age where it was normal for kids to carry deep reverence toward gallant knights. Which kid had never dreamed of becoming a suave knight and saving a princess from the clutches of an evil dragon?\u2026 Though admittedly, there was a far greater chance for the princesses of this world to be the ones doing the saving instead.Kane took a second-look at Roel and affirmed his thoughts once more.Ah, what a fine, honest youth!Prince Kane nodded in great satisfaction before turning his gaze toward Alicia. Alicia raised her skirt slightly and curtsied, her movements as graceful as a true princess.\u201cI am Alicia Ascart, the adopted daughter of Marquess Carter. It\u2019s my pleasure to meet you, Your Highness Kane.\u201dAlicia\u2019s greeting was polite, but there was a feeling of lofty coldness behind her words. It didn\u2019t appear to be a conscious intention on her part, but rather, it felt more like her natural disposition. Kane, despite his vast experiences with all sorts of people, was a little surprised to see such airs from a child.\u201cThis child\u2026 I see.\u201dKane examined Alicia for a moment longer before a thought came to his mind; his gaze suddenly changed from surprise to a heavy expression. He reached out his hand and ruffled Alicia\u2019s soft hair lightly.\u201cYou must be Larthe\u2019s child.\u201d\u201cY-you know my father?\u201d\u201cOf course, I was the one who mentored him!\u201d2 replies\u00a0\u2013 6 hours agoKane thumped his chest like a proud military man before finally sighing deeply once more. He then turned to look at Carter.\u201cYou did well. Take care of her.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let Larthe down.\u201dThe two men nodded in mutual agreement. While looking at Alicia, Kane suddenly recalled something, and he beckoned with his hand, saying, \u201cCome here, Nora. Meet your new friends.\u201dA beautiful figure silently walked forward. She was a golden-haired girl with eyes the color of sapphire, commanding a presence that rivaled the brilliant sun.\u201cNora Xeclyde. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet the two of you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - I, Roel, Speak No LiesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16: I, Roel, Speak No LiesNora Xeclyde.This was a name Roel remembered from the memories of his previous life, as well as one of the individuals whom he would prefer to stay away from if at all possible.She was the future head of the Xeclyde House, as well as the future Holy Eminence of the Saint Mesit Theocracy, which meant that she would eventually become a powerhouse of this world. Nora Xeclyde was revered no matter where she went, such that in the game she was deferentially addressed by the academy students as the Queen. Together with Alicia, they were known as the Golden Sun and Silver Moon of the Saint Mesit Theocracy.Needless to say, she was one of the four capture targets.It was just unfortunate that her exterior portrayal of a perfect young lady was not an accurate reflection of her true character. To put it in simple terms, Nora Xeclyde was an extreme sadist.She put on a dignified look before outsiders, compelling others to defer to her authority, but the truth was that she was someone who derived great joy from inflicting pain on others. That gave rise to her other reputation as the \u2018Bloodthirsty Angel\u2019. Any fight that involved her would need to be mosaiced out in order not to traumatize onlookers.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 4 hours agoThe concepts of good and evil blurred when it came to Nora Xeclyde. She treated those who were close to her kindly and, at the same time, would never hesitate to stand up against evil. But, on the other hand, it was hard for anyone to claim that she was a good person; not after witnessing the mountains of corpses and rivers of blood left in her wake following a violent rampage, especially with the knowledge that she relished in it.Roel\u2019s deepest impression of Nora Xeclyde came from a CG in the game. It depicted the supposedly saintly Nora posing with her bloodstained wings unfurled as she stared at the player with an intoxicated look on her face. The contrasting elements of good and evil harmonized in her, forming a breathtaking work of art.Art appreciation aside though, Roel wanted nothing to do with such a person in reality. He felt like he needed to distance himself from Nora for the sake of his own sanity.One must know that even the main character had to spend three whole semesters shamelessly pursuing and fawning over Nora Xeclyde, even nearly losing his life in the process, before finally successfully capturing her. If it was already that tough for the main character, there was no way anyone else in the world could possibly win her over!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu1 reply\u00a0\u2013 4 hours agoIf Roel, an antagonist in the game, were to try to do the same, he would definitely be killed in a heartbeat!Heh, I even have a professional team to send me off with fanfare if that were to happen!1 reply\u00a0\u2013 4 hours agoThinking about the Skeleton Pallbearer Army he had exchanged his Affection Points for, Roel suddenly felt a foreboding sensation in the pit of his stomach. One must know that Nora had played a huge part in orchestrating Roel\u2019s eventual death in the game!Once again, Roel reaffirmed his determination:I mustn\u2019t get involved with this girl!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cYour Highness Nora, is the red tea to your liking?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s delicious. Thank you, Miss Alicia.\u201dIn the lounge, Nora, Alicia, and Roel were seated together, sipping on tea while having a pleasant conversation. So far, an hour had passed since everyone first met in the foyer, and Roel\u2019s group parted ways with the adults. Elsewhere, the grown-ups were in the midst of a secret conversation inside one of the guest rooms.Roel had no idea what his father and Kane were discussing as he was not privy to any of it, but it was bound to be something of significant importance. The fact that Kane chose to bring Nora along also hinted at one thing\u2014the Xeclyde House wished to get on good terms with the Ascart House.What better way to ensure close, long-term ties between the houses than to have their children play together?The Ascart House was known as one of the Five Eminent Noble Houses inside the Theocracy, and this was an accepted fact even within the Holy Capital. The Xeclydes had much to gain from rallying the Ascart House over to their side, and the best way to do so was to win over their young successor, Roel.In fact, it was a convention for successors of noble houses to socialize and forge amicable ties with other houses. For that reason, children of nobility had to mature early so that they could maneuver their way through all sorts of social situations.The battle to build factions had long begun, and those who were slower to realize it would be at a disadvantage. The three children sitting in the lounge were all very cognizant of this fact.Nora, despite her high standing, carried no arrogance in her attitude. She guided the conversation with grace and magnanimity as she attempted to get on closer terms with her two companions.Alicia could see through Nora\u2019s intent, but the experiences she had been through made her extremely guarded against all of her peers except for Roel.And as for Roel\u2026He was simply smiling his way through the situation, trying his best to feign death. He made his stance very, very clear through his actions:I want no part of this.Nora might be a huge tree, and an alliance between the Ascarts and the Xeclydes was indeed a very enticing proposal. There were great benefits if one were to look at it from the standpoint of their houses, but Roel was currently looking at it from his own shoes.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 4 hours agoAs a boss in the common route, he was a villain who was deeply hated by the main character and the capture targets. He would, one day, be killed by them. In order to avert that tragic fate, he only had a single goal at the moment, and that was to pull out all his death flags.As long as he succeeded in it, he should be able to live to a ripe, old age.It seemed like a feasible plan, but there was just one little problem.How was he supposed to remove his death flags when he wasn\u2019t entirely sure what they were? He didn\u2019t have full knowledge of the storyline!The solution that Roel came up with to his dilemma was simple enough: don\u2019t do anything the original Roel would have!If the original Roel was extremely cruel to Alicia, the current Roel would dote upon her to the high heavens! Or, something along those lines.It was likely that the original Roel would immediately catch on to Nora\u2019s goodwill and proceed to fawn upon her. So, the current Roel decided to stay as far away from Nora as possible.Trying to display goodwill to me? Sorry, but I\u2019m blind! Trying to butter me up with compliments? Sorry, but I\u2019m deaf!Say anything you want, I\u2019m not going to see or hear anything anyway. I\u2019ll just sit here and smile like the wallflower I am. Detest me if you want to. I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019ll be best if you detest me to the point where you never want to meet me again!\u201cCan I call you Roel?\u201dThe dignified Nora asked with a sincere and intimate tone. Roel pondered for a moment before replying with a smile.\u201cOf course, Your Highness. It\u2019s my honor.\u201dTsk, can you stop acting like we\u2019re close to one another?What Roel was saying with his mouth had nothing to do with the thoughts in his head. He plastered a polite smile on his face and responded to Nora\u2019s questions with the minimum level of civility required.\u201cRoel, can I become your friend?\u201d\u201cOf course, Your Highness.\u201dWho would want to be friends with you?\u201cAm I being a little too abrupt here?\u201d\u201cOf course not, Your Highness. It\u2019s my honor.\u201dIf you know that it\u2019s too abrupt, you shouldn\u2019t have done so in the first place.\u201c\u2026 What do you think of me?\u201d\u201cYour beauty is as the rays of the sun; your kindness overwhelming like the embrace of the earth. Our country shall prosper under the leadership of a great person like you. May Sia bless you.\u201dNow you\u2019re asking me to fawn on you too? Tsk, how shameless.\u201c\u2026 What do you think of our Xeclyde House?\u201d\u201cOur Ascart House will be your most stalwart supporters. There\u2019s no one in Saint Mesit who doesn\u2019t know of our unwavering loyalty toward the royal family, and\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough.\u201dNora cut Roel\u2019s blathering off with a wave of her hand, causing the latter to blink his eyes for a moment, but he readily stopped the stream of nonsense coming from his mouth.Are you finally getting sick of the bootlicking? If that\u2019s the case, let\u2019s just have our tea in peace, shall we?1 reply\u00a0\u2013 4 hours agoRoel thought as he lifted his teacup to take a sip. It was at this moment that Nora took out a red pendant from beneath her clothes.\u201cRoel, what do you think of this pendant of mine?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cYes, I think so too. I do fancy this pendant a lot. It refracts sixteen different rays of crimson light when light shines into it.\u201d\u201cAstounding.\u201d Roel shot a glance at the crimson pendant and replied with a compliment.Meanwhile, Nora leaned forward and continued with narrowed eyes, \u201cI should also mention that it has a unique ability. Are you curious to know what it is?\u201d\u201cIt would be my honor to know, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201dA smile crept onto Nora\u2019s lips as she beckoned Roel over with her finger.Roel was a little surprised by the gesture.Something\u2019s really not right.He felt there was something amiss, but after a brief hesitation, he still chose to lean over and listen to what the girl had to say.Now that Roel was blocking her from Alicia\u2019s view, Nora\u2019s smile swiftly grew colder and colder as she revealed the secret behind the crimson pendant with a frigid voice.\u201cIts effect is none other than\u2026 lie de-tec-tion.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Crap.\u201dUnder Nora\u2019s playful look, Roel finally spoke his true thoughts aloud for the first time in the past hour.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 - Digging My GravePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 17: Digging My GraveNora Xeclyde was born with a golden spoon in her mouth.With the bloodline of the Xeclydes flowing in her veins, she was always in the spotlight no matter where she went. Even from a young age, she was already put through the most rigorous education available.Great expectations were placed on her.From her bloodline of the highest tier, one that would send any bloodline purist nobles into a frenzy, to her impeccable looks, which would not have been out of place in an art gallery, the young Nora was a person favored by the gods.It felt as if she had been born with all of the gifts this world had to offerThe nobles of the royal court and the bishops of the church would often bump into her \u2018coincidentally\u2019, hoping to leave a good impression. Her peers, under the orders of their parents, desperately tried to flatter her, flooding her with a sea of praise.Despite this, Nora, with her impeccable upbringing, had always been able to keep her poise and respond with grace and magnanimity. But, beneath this flawless facade, there was only one thing racing through her mind:How boring.Everything felt boring and hypocritical, and it nearly drove her mad at times.How would it feel if everyone in the world had only one face to show you? Nora believed that none would have better credentials than herself to answer that.As the days of boredom continued endlessly, Nora slowly realized a little quirk inside of her. Whenever a troubled look appeared on the face of a person before her, suddenly things weren\u2019t so boring any longer.She didn\u2019t know yet that this was the awakening of a particularly disturbing nature; she simply thought that she was ill. However, in this world where mental illness was not considered an issue, she had no way of figuring out the cause.It was only during times when her servants had done wrong and needed to be punished that she was finally able to release her true nature. That said, she wasn\u2019t allowed to fully let loose either; those who possessed the Angel\u2019s Bloodline were expected to be compassionate.She felt stifled living such a life, constantly having to repress her nature. She sought a place where she could be true to herself.The children of the noble houses who supported the Xeclyde House were useless to her in that regard. Due to the hierarchical difference, they tended to view Nora with rose-tinted glasses, such that the reverence and admiration they carried toward her were earnest.Punish not those who are sinless; embrace those who embrace us so\u2014that was the motto of the Xeclyde House.Nora was not a person who would allow her selfish whims to get in the way of her principles, so she had no choice but to suppress her desires. She could only wait patiently for the day someone who wore a mask like her own would appear, someone whom she could expose her true self to without having to hold back.And, she felt like she might have finally found that someone.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cI\u2019m quite surprised, Roel. I didn\u2019t expect you to be a liar.\u201dAfter discreetly sending Alicia away, Nora gracefully picked up her teacup and took a sip as the corners of her lips inched upward uncontrollably. Opposite her, Roel looked a little unnerved, fidgeting in his seat.\u201cHa-Hahaha, Your Highness I believe that there might be some misunderstanding between the two of us\u2026\u201d\u201cAnother lie, but it matters not. You may keep trying if you wish to; your desperation does amuse me a little.\u201dNora assessed Roel with her gaze, seemingly admiring the black-haired boy sitting before her. The joy that came from the bottom of her heart made her already beautiful face look even more enchanting, but it just so happened that this was an expression that Roel was deeply familiar with.It was the joyful look Nora would reveal whenever she caught sight of prey.Shit! Why would this damned sadist set her eyes on me? What am I to do now?Why can\u2019t you just stay away from me? I don\u2019t want to die just yet!Roel, who was sweating profusely, quickly shut his mouth as he worked his mind desperately to figure out a countermeasure.Nora, on the other hand, paid no heed to Roel\u2019s lack of response and continued her monologue.\u201cTruth be told, your response did catch me off guard. Putting other things aside, I am still rather confident in my looks. I didn\u2019t think that you would deny that too. I admit that your little sister, Alicia, is quite a ravishing lady, but I didn\u2019t think that I would lose to her in a battle of charm. Why do you seem so guarded against me? Or could it be that\u2026\u201d1 reply\u00a0\u2013 6 hours agoNora leaned forward and looked intently at the nervous Roel.\u201c\u2026 you know of my true nature?\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dThe instant that Roel heard those words, he almost thought that he heard a chess piece landing on a chessboard, accompanied by a shout of \u2018Checkmate!\u2019. His body stiffened with anxiety.Against Nora, who had a lie detector in her arsenal, Roel only had three options: Admit to it openly, admit to it silently, or deny it and be corrected by the lie detector.Son of a banshee! Are these even options?!Realizing that he had been cornered, the exasperated Roel finally came to the limits of his endurance and decided to come clean.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. So, can you just stay away from me?\u201dRoel couldn\u2019t be bothered to keep up with the act anymore, so he wiped away his polite smile and leaned backward casually, speaking with a cold attitude.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 6 hours agoFine, I don\u2019t care anymore! Might as well go all out!\u201cI have no interest in you or your Xeclyde House. I don\u2019t intend to have close relations with you, and you can be assured that I won\u2019t attempt a revolt like a fool either. So, can you just let me off?1 reply\u00a0\u2013 6 hours agoRoel revealed his own thoughts in a straightforward manner.While the Ascart House was not on the same level as the royal family, it was still one of the top noble houses in Saint Mesit Theocracy. It could at least afford to wage a verbal war against a member of royalty!After all, despite the lord and vassal relationship that existed between the two, the Ascart House still had its own independent army.I won\u2019t join you, but I also won\u2019t turn against you. Surely, that should be enough to satisfy you, right?Roel was basically proclaiming his desire to maintain a neutral stance, and it was usually one of the safer moves to make in politics. Little did he know though, Nora\u2019s attention was still focused on something else that he had said.\u201cYou have no interest in me? Don\u2019t you\u2026 think that I\u2019m weird?\u201d\u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d Roel replied with a frown.Nora pondered for a moment before elaborating a little hesitantly, \u201cYou should already know about it; that I enjoy seeing others in a troubled position and begging for mercy. Sometimes, I get urges to step on them too\u2026 Don\u2019t you think that I\u2019m weird to have such a side to me?\u201d1 reply\u00a0\u2013 6 hours agoNora awkwardly revealed the darkest depths of her young mind, and it could be seen just how much of a dilemma she had been in over this matter.However, Roel, after listening to her words carefully, started laughing.Heh, if you think that just this much if weird, you\u2019re really looking down on yourself!Collars, chains, whips\u2026 Heh, there\u2019s plenty more that you haven\u2019t awakened to yet!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu1 reply\u00a0\u2013 6 hours agoKnowing what the future Nora would be like, Roel was exploding with retorts for her. However, since he was the one looking for a concession from her, he had no choice but to mellow his words a little.\u201cThat\u2019s nothing at all; you\u2019re still too young. There are plenty of people like you out there in the world, especially amongst the nobles. This little perverse side of yours right now isn\u2019t even worth mentioning at all.\u201d\u201cI-is that true?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dHaving lived in the digital age, where information onanythingwas never lacking, Roel was able to respond with great confidence.\u201cYou don\u2019t know just how horrifying humans can become when they really go all out. There are even monsters who feast on human flesh! Compared to them, you\u2019re like a pebble before a mountain!\u201d1 reply\u00a0\u2013 6 hours ago\u201cI-I see\u2026\u201dSomehow, it sounded exceptionally convincing when those words came from Roel. Having finally been released of her burden, she heaved a deep sigh of relief.Roel, who was oblivious to the fact that he had managed to counsel the young Nora out of the dilemma she was facing, was still ranting on about all sorts of weird fetishes he had encountered in his previous world, such as necrophilia and more. Through his words, the closed-off Nora seemed to have opened the doors to a brand new world.\u201c\u2026 So, what you\u2019re facing is nothing at all. As long as you get the consent of the other party and don\u2019t bother those around you, it\u2019ll all be good.\u201d\u201cI get it now.\u201dAfter listening to the long monologue from Roel, Nora nodded deeply as a glimmer of light sparkled inside her sapphire eyes.\u201cBut it would still be best not to let this matter get out, right? How am I to find anyone who will indulge me?\u201d\u201cDo you even need to ask?\u201d Roel glared at the young girl before him disdainfully, as if mocking her lack of wit.\u201cYou are a member of the Xeclyde House, the future successor of the throne! There are plenty of people willing to be treated like a dog by you! If you were to put them in a line, the queue would stretch from one end of the Holy Capital to the other! What are you worrying about? Anyone you ask would be honored to take on the role!\u201d\u201cDo you mean it? Would he really think of it that way?\u201d\u201cOf course! Trust me, no one will be able to reject you!\u201dRoel waved his hand grandly as he gave his reassurance.\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, Mister Roel\u2026 I think that you\u2019re a good choice.\u201dNora rose to her feet and strutted up to Roel, carrying an air of fragrance. A foot stamped down on the chair between Roel\u2019s thighs as she leaned in and grabbed him by the collar. She spoke with an assertive tone, which oddly paired well with the slight blush on her cheeks.\u201cBecome mine.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A hint of blush in her cheeks gave off a scent of temptation, making it hard for one to reject her demands.2 replies\u00a0\u2013 7 hours agoThe beauty of the saintly angel had already been cloaked by a layer of decadent desire, making Roel feel as if he had already caught a glimpse of the grown-up Nora. In an instant, he pushed aside Nora\u2019s hand and regained his freedom.\u201cW-what are you talking about? Didn\u2019t I tell you to get away from me? I have no interest in having anything to do with you!\u201dCatching a whiff of the slightly sweet scent lingering in the air, Roel felt deeply relieved that it was just little Nora that he was dealing with here. Were it the mature Nora standing before him instead, he might have very well succumbed to her temptation.To be honest, becoming Nora\u2019s \u2018pet\u2018wasn\u2019t all bad. There weren\u2019t many people on the continent who could rival her in beauty or power, after all.On top of that, despite her sadistic and domineering nature, she was very caring about those whom she considered hers. This made her a little reminiscent of a menacing yet doting elder sister that went:Only I can bully you.Even the main character in the game seemed to have thoroughly enjoyed his time being Nora\u2019s pet.But, being a pet was one thing; being a dead pet was another.Other than Alicia, who was an exception, how could the antagonist possibly walk alongside one of the capture targets? If he were to continue walking the same path as the original Roel, before he knew it, he would have already become the lynching target of the main character and his capture targets!My goal should be pulling out my death flags; everything else is just unimportant. What could possibly be more important than staying alive?\u201cYou know everything about me and even counseled me, but now you\u2019re trying to push me away?\u201dNora was a little perplexed by Roel\u2019s attitude. She pondered for a moment before adding on.\u201cJust what do you dislike about me? I can change. Or, could it be, you carry some kind of prejudice against my family?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s neither. I\u2019m simply uninterested in you. Besides, why does it have to be me?\u201dRoel quibbled weakly, leaving Nora silent for a moment, before she calmly responded.\u201cIt\u2019s because I feel that your thoughts are too idealistic. You may not mind who I am, but it\u2019s optimistic to assume it\u2019ll be the same for others. Whoever I approach can very well use this as a weapon to attack me and my family, perhaps even blackmailing us.\u201dHaving grown up surrounded by conspiracy, Nora had developed a good nose for information that could potentially be used against her.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 7 hours agoHoly moly, is this really a nine-year-old child before me? Just what in the world are they putting noble children through for them to be so imposing?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu3 replies\u00a0\u2013 6 hours agoRoel\u2019s breathing halted for a moment as he briefly saw the aura of a conqueror in the young Nora.It was no wonder the original Roel ended up dying so tragically in the game. Compared to these elites, the original Roel was practically no different from a brain dead eggplant!Thinking up to this point, Roel suddenly recalled that the people in this world typically married at 14, so it stood to reason that they would mature early. It was the environment that placed greater expectations on the youths and left them to have no choice but to mature.\u201cDon\u2019t you have subordinates too? I\u2019m referring to the noble children in your faction.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t do. It\u2019s also a taboo for my weakness to fall into the hands of my subordinates. Not to mention that there\u2019s a chance that the secret might leak out.\u201d\u201cWait a moment, what you\u2019re saying doesn\u2019t make sense at all. If they won\u2019t do, what makes you think that it\u2019ll work with me?\u201dRoel asked with a bizarre look on his face.Nora placed a hand on her cheek and pondered deeply before finally replying.\u201cFor some reason, I don\u2019t think that you\u2019ll betray me. Putting my feelings aside, as one of the Five Eminent Noble Houses, there isn\u2019t much you could earn by spreading malicious rumors about me. Also, there\u2019s Uncle Carter around too\u2026\u201dSomehow, the more Roel questioned her judgment, the more certain Nora became with her decision. This left him a bit flustered, so he decided to snap her out of this dangerous train of thought.\u201cEnough. For the time being, can you put your foot down first? Alicia will be coming back very soon.\u201d\u201cOh hoh! Are you worried that I might give myself away now?\u201d\u201cWorried your head!\u201dFeeling a huge headache setting-in under Nora\u2019s relentless pressure, Roel grabbed her leg and firmly planted it back down on the parlor floor.\u201cCome to think of it, I have been wondering about this for a while now, but how do you know about my interests? Are you able to read minds or something?\u201d2 replies\u00a0\u2013 7 hours ago\u201c\u2026\u201dMind-reader, my ass! Would I have been duped by you and your accursed lie detector if I had that kind of cheat? I just know what the future holds for you.Despite his fierce mental retort, Roel remained perfectly calm outwardly, as if what Nora was talking about was just a minor issue.\u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d\u201cHmm, is that so?\u201dNora stared at Roel as her eyes narrowed in interest. Her sapphire eyes looked a little more spirited than they did when she first walked into this lounge.Is this a magician house? How interesting.A rare, unrestrained smile surfaced on the lips of the young girl as she nodded contemplatively. She gracefully walked back to her seat and sat back down. It was also at this moment that Alicia returned too.\u201cPardon me, Your Highness. I have kept you waiting.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Please, have a seat. Your tea is getting cold.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you. May I ask what you have been talking about with Lord Brother?\u201dAlicia asked to catch up on the conversation after returning to her seat. Those words made Nora chuckle a little as she replied.\u201cOur interests.\u201d(Affection Points +200!)\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201cYou stubborn old fool, why won\u2019t you listen to my advice at all!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kane, but I need to consider this matter more deeply.\u201d\u201cSigh! Fine then. There\u2019s still some time, so I\u2019ll wait a little longer.\u201dThe tall golden-haired man returned back to his seat, but the look on his face showed that he was reluctant to let things rest just like that. Sitting opposite, Carter appeared to have many things on his mind too.A knock sounded from the other side of the chamber door.\u201cOld master, Her Highness, young master, and the others await you in the foyer.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dCarter looked visibly relieved after hearing the maid\u2019s report. He looked at the golden-haired Kane before him and asked.\u201cHow about we conclude the discussions for now?\u201d\u201cYes, it looks like we have no other choice. I need to rush back to the Holy Capital by tomorrow.\u201dKane shook his head helplessly as he grumbled about the long journey he would have to take right after. The two of them emerged from the guest room together and headed down the central staircase, only to see the three children chatting pleasantly with one another in the foyer.\u201cHm?\u201dLooking at Nora, who had a brilliant smile on her face, Kane subconsciously halted his footsteps out of bewilderment. Seeing this, Carter also stopped as well.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Kane?\u201d\u201c\u2026 No, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dLong had it been since Kane saw such a dazzling smile on his daughter\u2019s face, to the point where he couldn\u2019t help but be stunned for a moment. However, he quickly brushed it off with a wave of the hand and continued his descent down the stairs.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 7 hours agoMeanwhile, Carter noticed how close the children appeared to be, and he felt a little curious as to what had happened. One must know that Roel was notorious for being a little tyrant in the circle of nobles, exploiting his father\u2019s high status to act as he pleased. As a result, he barely had any friends at all.Did he manage to change that aspect of himself too?\u201cI have kept you all waiting. Young ladies, little gentleman, it looks like you had a pleasant time together?\u201dAs the two fathers approached, Kane took the initiative to address the three children.Roel, who felt like he was going bald from the stress of being eyed as prey by Nora, immediately turned to Kane and replied.\u201cYes, Your Highness Kane. It\u2019s our honor to have Her Highness Nora here, and we have spent a pleasant time together.\u201dThis formal response left Kane a little surprised. Nora\u2019s eyebrows also shot up a little as she quickly figured out the little thoughts that Roel had in mind.Thinking of using noble etiquette to restrain me, so that I\u2019ll leave as soon as possible? Heh, you sure have quite a few small tricks up your sleeves.Such thoughts in mind, Nora stood forward and, before everyone\u2019s eyes, wrapped her hand lightly around the crook of Roel\u2019s arm.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 7 hours ago\u201cLord Father, even though it hasn\u2019t been a long time since we met, Roel and I are already good friends. Would it still be alright if I drop by the Ascart House in the future to meet again?\u201dNora looked at Roel with deeply sincere eyes that made it look as if they were bosom buddies already, causing Roel\u2019s face to twitch a little. At the same time, Alicia, seeing how chummy the two of them were getting with one another, suddenly looked a little uncomfortable.\u201cOh? The two of you are already friends? It looks like our children are getting along better than we are.\u201dKane remarked with a slightly bitter smile, and Carter looked equally helpless too. Carter then walked forward and shot a deep look at Roel before replying to Nora\u2019s question.\u201cYour Highness, as long as you wish, the doors of our Ascart House are always open to you.\u201d\u201cThat is wonderful to hear. Thank you, Uncle Carter.\u201dAs if there was honey in her voice, Nora\u2019s words swiftly dispelled the slightly heavy atmosphere between the two adults, inducing Carter to chuckle softly as well.Meanwhile, Kane shot another glance at the two children whose arms were linked together, and his smile slowly grew warm as well.The only one who objected strongly to this was Roel. His face was nearly cramping up from all the twitching it had been doing, and his heart was pounding hard with a resounding \u2018Noooooo\u2019.3 replies\u00a0\u2013 6 hours agoDamn it, this lass actually turned the tables on me. Uncle Carter your head! I\u2019ve been betrayed.\u201cAlright, Nora. We need to get going.\u201dWhile Roel was still preoccupied with his inner monologue, the crowd clustered in the foyer chatted a little longer before Kane took a look at his watch and began urging his daughter to depart. It was only then that Nora reluctantly released Roel\u2019s arm and bade her farewells.\u201cI\u2019ll definitely be seeing you again, Roel\u2026\u201dThe lively golden-haired girl said with a vibrant smile. She watched the black-haired, golden-eyed boy with her own exuberant eyes, as she muttered out the latter half of her sentence beneath her breath.You aren\u2019t getting away from me.(Affection Points +200!)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, it just so happened that Prince Kane\u2019s daughter had been training in the Holy Knight Order recently, and as a doting father, Prince Kane made an on-the-spot decision to grant his daughter a short break. He brought her here with him, thus bringing about this coincidental meeting.Carter had never imagined that this coincidence would bring about an unintended but pleasant development.2 replies\u00a0\u2013 8 hours agoNora Xeclyde was a household name in the Saint Mesit Theocracy\u2019s circle of nobles. A pure bloodline and an excellent upbringing meant that she held great potential in her. She was still young, but everyone knew better than to underestimate this young princess.If one really had to point out of a flaw in Nora Xeclyde, it would be her overly perfect character. Her impeccability made it hard for anyone else, aside from family members, to get close. Even Kane, as her father, had lamented on several occasions that his daughter seemed to be becoming more distant, as if she was putting on a mask of her perfection to conceal her true self.But for the first time, this independent and loftily high flower of nobility actually took the initiative to link arms with a peer, even showing reluctance to part from him. Carter would have never believed this to be possible had he not seen it with his own eyes.And what was even more unbelievable was that this person was his own son!1 reply\u00a0\u2013 7 hours agoO\u2019 great Sia, what in the world is going on here?Carter felt deeply perplexed about this matter. He took a few good looks at his son, assessing the boy from head-to-toe after Kane had left, but he was unable to discern anything. Since he couldn\u2019t determine what had brought about such a reaction from Nora, in the end, he could only attribute it to Roel\u2019s recent diligence.2 replies\u00a0\u2013 7 hours agoIndeed, ever since the previous heart-to-heart conversation they had, the little boy had undergone great changes. Even when hosting the guests earlier, his bearing was on point, keeping a polite front yet not unnaturally so.Still, Roel would have to put in a lot of hard work in order to get on the good side of that young princess!Eyy, it\u2019ll be a tough road ahead, my son!It never even crossed Carter\u2019s mind that the situation was the complete opposite of what he was thinking of, that the roles of who was trying to get closer to who were completely reversed!In any case, his impression of Roel did improve a lot due to this matter.As a father, Carter was constantly thinking about how he could pave the route ahead for Roel, so that his son, who possessed nearly no supernatural abilities at all, could live an easier life in this world. In that regard, building up connections was of utmost importance, especially with the other major noble houses.The Xeclydes, as the strongest faction and royal family of the Theocracy, was naturally the number one noble house to get close to. Carter\u2019s initial thought was to formally hand over his ties with Kane to Roel, somewhat similar to an extension of friendship across generations, but it seemed like there was no need for that now.Instead, Nora\u2019s intimate attitude toward Roel sent Carter\u2019s thoughts spinning off elsewhere; he began to review his plan once more. Perhaps he should change the Ascart House\u2019s stance and build closer ties with the royal family.With the protection of the royal family and the authority the Ascart House commanded, Roel should at least be able to live a safe and peaceful life, even if he possessed no power at all. Looking at the current relationship of those two children, there was a good chance that they would continue growing closer, perhaps even\u20264 replies\u00a0\u2013 6 hours agoNo, it was still too early to be thinking that far ahead now.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 8 hours agoCarter looked again at the black-haired boy, who was busy feeding Alicia at the dining room table, and shook his head inconspicuously.His son had his own life to live, and more often than not, plans couldn\u2019t keep up with changes. There was no point in thinking so much now.Moreover, Carter wasn\u2019t too fond of arranged marriages between nobles; he himself had courted and married the woman he loved. Roel was the crystallization of the love between him and his wife, which was also a reason why he doted on him so much.Taking one more look at the tender sight of his son feeding his younger adopted sister, Carter felt his mood buoying to a new high. He even ate an additional portion of lamb steak with gusto.It was perhaps a good thing that he was oblivious to the thoughts running through his son\u2019s mind at the moment.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Did I mess things up?Ever since Nora\u2019s departure, Roel had been asking himself this question over and over again for the rest of the day.As a transmigrator who knew of the tragic fate that awaited him, Roel had set a very clear final goal for himself:To pluck out all his death flags and live a peaceful life.In order to achieve this goal, Roel had managed to analyze a few side goals that he needed to achieve, and these included preventing the decline of the Ascart House, treating Alicia kindly, and avoiding getting involved with the other key characters in the common route.But today, he met the greatest crisis in his plans.Not only did he fail to put distance between himself and the other key figures, he even got eyed by the most despairly difficult capture target of them all to deal with, Nora Xeclyde!C-c-calm down! At times like this, I need to stay calm and think it through. It isn\u2019t the end yet!It was not as if he didn\u2019t consider the possibility that he could avoid the death flag by getting on good terms with Nora Xeclyde, but one consideration he had was that this event could very well be part of the storyline too. What if he had unknowingly triggered this death flag through this?There were too many details missing from his knowledge.However, as he thought more about it, he felt that he might have been thinking too much.It was a real world that he was currently living in, not the same game world that he knew of in his previous life. Brains were functioning perfectly normally, for most people at least, and love and hatred wouldn\u2019t just pop out of nowhere for no reason. The greatest evidence to that was the reconciliation of the relationship between him and Alicia. If he was really forced to play along with the storyline, Alicia would have hated him no matter what he tried to do.Perhaps he was getting ahead of himself, thinking that this simple meeting with Nora would lead to his villainous bad end. Besides, his relationship with Nora was likely to have already been different from that of the original Roel.The original Roel most likely dumped a truckload of earnest compliments on Nora in order to get on her good side, which, in turn, would not have triggered the lie-detecting crimson pendant and caught her attention.From this perspective, he was indeed doing what the original Roel never would have. So, the possibility of him meeting the same ending as the storyline should have lessened\u2026 probably.Just like that, Roel tried his best to cheer himself up, but this resulted in him being a little inattentive about what was happening right in front of him. Those glowing eyes that were usually focused on Alicia were nowhere to be seen.And this was vividly felt by Alicia.Noticing the peculiarity with her brother, Alicia lowered her head helplessly as she gripped the hems of her dress tightly.Big brother Roel must still be thinking about Her Highness.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 8 hours agoAlicia recalled the golden-haired girl she had met earlier in the day, her graceful disposition, her incomparable beauty, and her esteemed standing. All of those imprinted an image of her as an impeccable princess in the minds of others.

Where are my Affection Points? It\u2019s not growing anymore?Alicia had always been Roel\u2019s biggest client when it comes to Affection Points. He could expect to see an ocean of green light every dinner, as his Affection Points shot right through the roof, but astonishingly, Alicia had been quiet for the entire dinner. There weren\u2019t even the slightest Affection Points coming out of her at the moment.Is it that Alicia isn\u2019t green anymore, or that my eyes are playing tricks on me?Roel was a little perplexed, thinking that something wrong might have happened to the System. However, when he turned his head over, he saw something green popping up above Carter\u2019s head.Ah? That\u2019s not right, the System isn\u2019t malfunctioning. Does it mean that the problem originates from Alicia?So, Roel began examining the little girl before him closely, and indeed, therewassomething off about her.Today\u2019s Alicia kept lowering her head, and she hardly spoke a word at all. The smile on her face looked forced, and tears were glistening in her ruby eyes. It was as if someone had bullied her.A-ah? What\u2019s going on? Don\u2019t tell me that someone actually dared to bully Alicia? That person must be tired of living!Roel flew into a rage. As the spring of his Affection Points, Alicia had contributed over half the points he had earned to date. It was no exaggeration to say that she was the key that determined whether the Ascart House would decline or not, along with Roel\u2019s final fate.Anyone who dared make Alicia unhappy right now was practically a mortal enemy who was out for his life! Such a person deserved to be pinned to the ground, beaten to a pulp, and stomped into the earth.With such vicious thoughts in mind, Roel began gently asking the silver-haired girl the reason behind her unhappiness, but astonishingly, she refused to speak at all.Huh? What\u2019s going on here?The confused Roel pondered for a moment before asking once more with an even gentler voice.\u201cAlicia, can tell me what is bothering you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it something that you can\u2019t tell me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRoel continued asking several more questions, but Alicia insisted on maintaining her silence, leaving him deeply perplexed.What is going on here? Alicia is usually quite obedient, so why isn\u2019t she saying anything at all?Could this be something really serious? This won\u2019t do. I have to make her speak no matter what.Having made up his mind, Roel began drawing forth the huge reserves of untapped acting talent within him to put on a magnificent play.\u201cI understand. It can\u2019t be helped if you can\u2019t tell me about it.\u201dRoel\u2019s voice suddenly became weak and helpless, as if he had suffered some sort of heavy blow.\u201cI thought that I could open your heart, that you trusted me, but it looks like I have overestimated myself. I\u2019m sorry for troubling you, Alicia. Treat it as if I haven\u2019t said anything at all.\u201dRoel\u2019s downtrodden tone caused the silent Alicia to hurriedly raise her head in astonishment. As soon as she saw the disheartened look of the black-haired boy before her, she felt a pang in her heart.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it! It\u2019s not like that at all! It\u2019s just that I-I\u2026\u201dAlicia wanted to explain the situation, but her words were jammed in her throat, refusing to come out at all. In the end, she had to lower her head before she could squeeze out a question with great difficulty.\u201cLord Brother, do you\u2026 like me?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dRoel, who was still immersed in his acting a moment ago, was suddenly jolted out of character, causing him to respond foolishly. A moment later, he widened his eyes and immediately replied.\u201cWhy would you suddenly ask me that question?\u201d\u201cB-because Lord Brother, you like Her Highness Nora more, right?\u201dAlicia raised her head to look at Roel with moistened eyes as she asked.\u201cHer Highness Nora is more beautiful than me, and she\u2019s a princess who\u2019ll be able to help you in the future. Compared to her, I\u2019m just a child who brings you trouble and can\u2019t even eat my own food\u2026\u201dAs Alicia spoke, her tears began flowing down, leaving Roel feeling so flustered that he felt like he was going to suffer a heart attack. With a deeply helpless sigh, he quickly started to explain himself.\u201cWhat are you thinking about? When did I say that I like Nora?\u201d\u201cBut you have been in a daze ever since Her Highness Nora left!\u201dA daze?Alicia\u2019s words made Roel widen his eyes in realization.What in the world\u2026 My daze is out of shock, not yearning! Thinking about her? Hah, I would rather that she never appeared before me at all!Utterly speechless, Roel could only reach out to wipe the tears from Alicia\u2019s face. Now he understood the root of the problem.Even if Alicia had matured beyond her age, the lack of companionship from her parents since young and the bullying she suffered from her peers still left some trauma behind, causing her to lack a sense of security. Now, she had finally found a place for herself, but that only made her even more fearful of losing it all.Having understood the situation, Roel sighed deeply. He patted Alicia dotingly before reaching out to embrace her.\u201cAlicia, don\u2019t get too hung up with fears that will never come to be. You\u2019ve nothing to fear at all. As long as you wish it, I\u2019ll always remain by your side.\u201d\u201cL-lord Brother?\u201dFeeling the warm arms wrapped around her, Alicia felt her insecurities slowly slipping away.\u201cYes, Nora might be an excellent individual. She\u2019s a great beauty and has a lofty standing, but what about it? My Alicia doesn\u2019t pale in comparison to her at all!\u201d\u201cH-how could I possibly compete with Her Highness\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are thoughtful, and your presence heals me each time I return exhausted from work. So what if you can\u2019t use a fork and knife? I\u2019m the one who enjoys feeding you. As long as you are fine with it, I\u2019m more than happy to be able to take care of you.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLight pats on the back and words of reassurance calmed Alicia\u2019s fearful heart. Eventually, the emotions that she had been suppressing within finally poured out, and she began crying in Roel\u2019s embrace.\u201cBig brother Roel,hicdon\u2019t leave me! I love you!\u201d\u201cI love you too, Alicia.\u201dRoel said as he tenderly stroked Alicia\u2019s little head affectionately. While it was true that he was saying these words to comfort her, they also reflected his true thoughts as well.Over the past month they had spent together, Roel had seen many sides to this child. She was gentle, kind, smart, and diligent, but at the same time, she was sensitive, insecure, and lacked self-esteem. Even putting aside the storyline, Roel would still want to take care of this little girl and protect her.In Roel\u2019s heart, Alicia was a wounded angel who had to be cared for with tenderness. As for that other sadist of an angel, it would be best if he could stay as far away from her as possible.Of course, Roel also knew that things wouldn\u2019t remain this way forever. Alicia was still young for now, but it was only a matter of time before she matured. Once she came of age and became more conscientious to the differences between men and women, she would probably put some distance between them automatically. There was no way they could always be together.With such thoughts in mind, Roel couldn\u2019t help but sigh in reluctance. Perhaps this was the kind of emotions that a father felt watching his daughter grow up.It was at this moment that green light suddenly sprouted from Alicia\u2019s head.(Affection Points +1000!)(Affection Points +1000!)(Affection Points +1000!)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 - Young Master, Choose True LovePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 21: Young Master, Choose True LoveIt was the first time since obtaining the System that Roel saw it flooding out notifications.While holding his beloved sister tightly in his arms, he found his sight completely blinded by a frenzied outpour of green light. In just ten short seconds, he had already received 20 notifications.Holy moly! This payout of Affection Points is almost enough to match the combined total I earned throughout the past month! Furthermore, it\u2019s one thing for Alicia to go green\u2026 but why the hell is Anna going green as well?Roel looked at his personal maid with question marks floating around his head.While he was feeling confused about the bewildering situation, Anna was feeling deeply moved to see that the ship she had been rooting for all this while was finally moving forward.As expected, true love only exists between our young master and young miss. No matter how great the princess might be, she\u2019ll never prevail in the face of true love!The fanatic shipper, Anna, had actually been feeling quite uneasy too ever since Nora\u2019s departure. Nora\u2019s perfection left a lasting impression, not just on Alicia, but on the servants of the manor as well.In terms of looks, both had their own strengths and charms, but Nora had a crushing victory in terms of background. On top of that, she had displayed formidable attack power earlier in the foyer as possible rival material. It was more than enough to rattle the hearts of the Roel X Alicia shippers.They knew instinctively that there would soon come the rise of a rivaling power known as the \u2018Roel X Nora Ship\u2019, and perhaps, even the old master himself might have chosen to defect to that faction!However, Anna decided to stand firm in her faith. She\u2019d clasped her hands tightly together as she affirmed her beliefs in those two children again and again.It was not without reason that Anna had such a deep attachment to the Roel X Alicia Ship. True love was simply hard to come by in this world, especially among nobles. Marriages were often pegged with a price tag, and couples were forced to marry one another without even meeting beforehand. To some, the freedom to love could be the most valuable and unreachable thing to them in the world.Young master, I know that Nora is a perfect princess, and the Ascart House will rise to greater heights under the support of the royal family, but none of this measures up to the value of true love! You have to grasp your own happiness with your own hands, just like the old master!Recalling the sorrowful fate awaiting herself, Anna looked at Roel with eyes filled with unwavering determination, hoping to give him the strength to push through the difficult route ahead with the sheer force of her gaze.On the other hand, Roel was simply bewildered.What is going on? Why is Anna staring at me so frighteningly? Did I do wrong? No, she\u2019s still giving me Affection Points. All of the servants are giving me Affection Points\u2026?\u201cRoel, what\u2019s wrong? Why did Alicia cry?\u201dCarter, who had been immersed in his thoughts the whole time, finally noticed the anomaly with the two children and spoke up.Roel quickly retracted his gaze from his surroundings and replied.\u201cAlicia suddenly recalled a story she read inside Origin of Magicians and got a little scared.\u201d\u201cAhh. There are indeed a few stories in there that are quite frightening. Alicia is still a little too young to be reading that.\u201dCarter nodded in realization.Roel continued comforting Alicia while looking at his father. Suddenly, a thought came to mind. This could be a good opportunity to have some questions that had been lingering in his head answered.\u201cFather, I have been wanting to ask you a few questions regarding magicians. Would it be convenient now?\u201d\u201cOh? I didn\u2019t think that you would be interested in this. Sure, feel free to ask any question that troubles you.\u201dCarter was more than delighted to hear that his son had some interest in magicians. He placed his fork and knife down and gestured for the servants to serve the desserts so that the father and son duo could enjoy a leisurely talk.While the servants busied themselves, Roel began asking about the power systems in this world.\u201cFather, is there any tier classification system amongst magicians?\u201d\u201cTier classification?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m thinking of how there should be a tier classification for magicians in the same way bloodlines can be classified into Gold-tier, Silver-tier, and the sort.\u201dCarter widened his eyes in realization as he seemed to finally catch Roel\u2019s drift.\u201cAh, you must be referring to Degree of Assimilation?\u201d\u201cDegree of Assimilation?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Mana is the origin of all transcendental abilities in the world, and any being that is capable of utilizing transcendental abilities would suffer from the corrosion of mana. The very ability to utilize transcendental abilities means that one has managed to adapt to the corrosion to some extent. We call this process of adaptation \u2018Assimilation\u2019, and the Degree of Assimilation is what determines a transcendent\u2019s strength.\u201cGoing by the constitution of humans, there are basically seven stages to the Degree of Assimilation, ranging from the lowest Origin Level 7 to the highest Origin Level 1. Each increment in origin level causes one\u2019s Degree of Assimilation to deepen, thus strengthening one\u2019s transcendental abilities too.\u201dCarter sipped his tea as he explained the theories with a professorial tone. Roel, on the other hand, fell into deep thoughts.The terms \u2018mana corrosion\u2019 and \u2018assimilation\u2019 sound like really bad news. Does becoming a magician mean turning into some sort of monster?Roel turned to his father once more and voiced his concerns.\u201cWill the process of assimilation affect one\u2019s body, like inducing weird mutations or something?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 That depends on the situation. However, the process of assimilation is more of an evolution than a mutation. It should perfect one\u2019s body instead of warping it. Some even manage to significantly lengthen their longevity through the process of assimilation. Of course, if something goes wrong during evolution, there is indeed a possibility that mutations could occur.\u201dCarter shot a glance at the two children, but after some consideration, he chose to refrain from telling them the frightening consequences of a failed evolution.Roel considered his father\u2019s words carefully. It was highly likely that the seven tiers of the Degree of Assimilation, Origin Levels 7 through 1, corresponded to the System\u2019s F-tier to S-tier. In other words, Roel\u2019s current trashy talent. which was only barely capable of producing a gust of hot air, was at least within the classification.\u201cFather, are the members of the militia also part of this classification?\u201d\u201cOf course. Most members of the militia are at Origin Level 6, which means that their strength is roughly comparable to that of a horse or ox. Most of them have limited talent though, so it\u2019s unlikely for them to climb any higher than that.\u201dRoel heaved a sigh of relief. Carter\u2019s response verified that the Origin Level 6 corresponded to the E-tier rating in the System, so it should be safe to assume that the two types of classifications corresponded to one another. If so, he could rely on it to gauge where he stood against others.\u201cFather, is there a vast difference between each origin level?\u201d\u201cThe difference between each level increases the more one heads upward, especially between the lower four tiers and the upper three tiers. To draw a comparison, it would be like the difference between an adult and an infant.\u201d\u201cI think I understand.\u201dRoel\u2019s tiny hope that \u2018Maybe I\u2019m not as weak as I thought\u2019 shattered into a million pieces. Heaving a deep sigh, he continued asking another question.\u201cFather, our house is a magician house, right? Given that we have managed to produce so many generations of magicians, shouldn\u2019t there be some sort of unique training method that our ancestors used?\u201d\u201cMagician house?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBut surprisingly, Carter blinked his eyes in confusion upon hearing his son\u2019s words.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s completely wrong to say that, but we\u2019re more of a military house. My official position in the Holy Knight Order is vice commander, not Chief Magician. Commoners tend to generalize all transcendents as magicians as they know nothing about the true nature of supernatural abilities. Chief Magician is actually just my Evolution Pathway.\u201d\u201cEvolution Pathway?\u201d\u201cIndeed. It\u2019s one of the few Evolution Pathways made available to me according to my Origin Attribute.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - The Differences in Origin AttributePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22: The Differences in Origin AttributeRealizing that Roel was completely clueless about this matter, Carter began to explain in detail what the evolution of a transcendent entailed.First and foremost, he explained the concept of magicians to Roel. While the common populace referred to all transcendents as magicians, it wasn\u2019t in line with how transcendents tended to identify themselves.To draw a parallel, it was just like how the word \u2018worker\u2019 could refer to a bricklayer, a farmer, a maid, or simply anyone who worked. Hardly anyone in their right mind would introduce themselves with a \u2018Hello, I am working as a worker\u2019 when talking about their occupation.\u201cThe way transcendents refer to their own power is to first identify their Origin Attribute, followed by their Origin Level, and finally their Evolution Pathway. For example, the more formal way to refer to the Holy Aura Warriors in the Holy Capital would be Compassion Origin L 3, Light Guardian.\u201d\u201cCompassion?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s their Origin Attribute. It\u2019s basically the nature of their power, which, in turn, determines the Evolution Pathways available to them.\u201dCarter had to spend quite a bit of effort educating his son, before Roel finally understood the meaning of Origin Attribute clearly.There were originally no pathways in the world. It\u2019s roads that have been trodden by many that eventually came to be known as pathways.This was a saying by a famous individual in the previous world Roel lived in, and it basically summarized what the so-called Origin Attribute in this world meant.Acquire greater power and transcend mortality, this had been the goal of all lifeforms since the First Epoch. It all started from a time far beyond the records of any historians, and it was only through the hymns sung through the ages that traces of that time could still be found.There were those who failed, but conversely, there were those who succeeded too. Thankfully, there was one thing that those who succeeded would usually do, and that was to record down the path that they had taken, so that the generations ahead can benefit from their experiences. This was also the most primitive form of Origin Attribute.Origin Attribute could be understood as a safer route to achieving evolution. It allowed those who were still fumbling around to swiftly join the ranks of the transcendents and slowly climb their way up relying on the successes of the predecessors.\u201cFather, how many Origin Attributes are there in the world?\u201d\u201cNo one knows for sure, but there must be thousands at least that have been uncovered since the ancient era. However, there are only a few which are known to us, and even fewer that are suitable for humans.\u201d\u201cSuitable for humans?\u201d\u201cYes, the Origin Attributes that humans are currently using are actually heritages left behind by ancient races. Take Compassion for example, it\u2019s said to be an Origin Attribute uncovered by the angels, and it belongs to the Xeclyde House. It\u2019s an Origin Attribute that\u2019s used only within the Theocracy.\u201dCarter\u2019s words had opened up a new world for Roel. He had never thought that the transcendental abilities would be this complicated. No wonder the game skipped the details and only mentioned the bloodlines!\u201cI understand it now. Father, is your Origin Attribute Compassion too?\u201d\u201cNo, my attribute is Wisdom. It comes from the Country of Scholars, Brolne. The origins of the Wisdom Origin Attribute has long since been lost within the eons, but it\u2019s one of the Three Main Origin Attributes accepted by the church.\u201d\u201cThree Main Origin Attributes?\u201d\u201cYes. They are namely Saint Mesit Theocracy\u2019s Compassion, Brolne\u2019s Wisdom, and the Knight Kingdom Pendor\u2019s Courage. The Three Main Origin Attributes are viewed to be most suitable for humans, and there\u2019s widespread acceptance surrounding them. All other Origin Attributes other than those three are deemed to be unorthodox by the church, and those who practice them are viewed to be heretics.\u201d\u201cAh? Why is that so?\u201d\u201cOther than the Three Main Origin Attributes, which are the most compatible for humans, other types are either extremely unstable or unsuitable for humans. Attempting to develop such Origin Attributes could lead to devastating consequences, such as a failure to evolve or other adverse side effects.\u201cI see. What would happen if the church deems a person to be a heretic?\u201d\u201cHeretics are banned from entering the Holy Capital and all Genesis Goddess Churches, which means that they aren\u2019t entitled to the benefits that the church provides, and they will be sidelined by the common populace. Other than that, there\u2019s nothing much to it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 They won\u2019t be captured and burned at the stake?\u201d asked Roel cautiously.Those words shocked Carter.\u201cOf course not! There are plenty of smaller religions in each country, so not even the Theocracy has the power to enforce such laws. Besides, most heretics haven\u2019t done anything bad, so burning all of them is obviously an irrational move. That said, the Theocracy would still strike down hard on cults that have been going around committing evildoing.\u201d\u201cOhhh, that\u2019s a relief.\u201dRoel heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing those words. Considering those sinister things sold in his System\u2019s Gold Coin Shop, it was probably only a matter of time before he became a heretic himself.It was fortunate that the religions in this world weren\u2019t as scary as those in his previous world\u2019s Middle Ages. He had no desire to experience the terror of a witch hunt personally.\u201cWhat if a heretic appears amongst the nobles of the Theocracy? Will he be killed?\u201d\u201cIf he hasn\u2019t committed any crime, no, though he\u2019ll be stripped of his noble position.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dTsk, isn\u2019t that as good as crippling me?\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s probably no nobles who would dare to become a heretic.\u201d\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s hard to say. While the Three Main Origin Attributes are viewed to be the most suited for humans, it\u2019s not a definite fact for everyone due to differences in constitutions. There are those who are born with a constitution that\u2019s more suited for other attributes. There are also cases where nobles turn to cults in order to fulfill their desires.\u201dIt was at this point that Carter\u2019s expression suddenly turned sullen, as if having recalled an unpleasant memory. Seeing this, Roel chose not to probe deeper into the matter.\u201cHow does the Theocracy identify these heretics then?\u201d\u201cA heretic would never display their power before others, so we aren\u2019t able to discern one from any ordinary person normally. However, there are specialists inside the Judgment Order that ensure that these heretics won\u2019t be able to get away once they reveal themselves.\u201dSpeaking to this point, Carter gave his exceedingly ordinary son a deep look before remarking meaningfully.\u201cPossessing transcendental abilities is not necessarily a good thing. With power comes responsibility, and you\u2019ll find yourself frequently entrusted with dangerous missions. Rather than constantly walk a thin thread between life and death, it\u2019s much better to just be an ordinary noble and enjoy a peaceful life.\u201c\u2026\u201dRoel didn\u2019t respond to his father\u2019s remark; he couldn\u2019t, and it all left him feeling slightly bitter on the inside. If being an ordinary noble was an option for him, he would willingly live the blissful life of a slacker, only moving when it was absolutely necessary to do so.But the problem was that fate had a tragic future in store for him, and he could very well tumble down that path if he didn\u2019t do a thing at all.\u201cYou should understand now why the term \u2018magician\u2019 is not apt to describe the lineage of our Ascart House now. It\u2019s not to say that our Ascart House doesn\u2019t have magicians\u2014I\u2019m one myself\u2014but each generation is simply too different from the others to generalize it as such. In fact, there are so many possible pathways for the Wisdom Origin Attribute that it eventually led to the Uprising of Scholar Guilds.\u201d\u201cScholar Guilds?\u201d\u201cYes. Those who undergo similar Evolution Pathways tend to gather together and form organizations to protect their own interests and share research results with one another, similar to how it is with the Light Guardians. These organizations became known as Scholar Guilds, and eventually, the guilds banded together to form a country of their own.\u201d\u201cA country of their own\u2026 You\u2019re referring to\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re thinking of,\u201d Carter nodded with a smile.\u201cThe Country of Scholars, Brolne; that\u2019s the country that has been formed by the Scholar Guilds!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was a place that was overflowing with the vibrance of youth.In his previous world, Roel wouldn\u2019t bother thinking too deeply into the history or purpose behind a location inside a game, but through Carter\u2019s explanation, he was able to get a rough idea as to just how powerful Brolne was.\u201cTo actually be able to form a country\u2026 Are the Scholar Guilds really that powerful?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just a couple of Scholar Guilds we\u2019re talking about here; Brolne has the backing of almost all major Scholar Guilds! As its focus is on research, its rules are significantly laxer, and it\u2019s on friendly terms with its neighboring countries too. It has managed to make a name for itself as the world\u2019s education hub, a place for countries to send their talents for nurturing.\u201dSpeaking to here, Carter took a look at Roel and Alicia and smiled.\u201cThe two of you will be heading there in the future too. I hope that you can enjoy your once-in-a-lifetime school life there.\u201d\u201cLord Father, you studied there before too?\u201dAlicia, who had long ago stopped crying, asked out of curiosity.Carter looked into the distance with nostalgic remembrance, as he nodded his head and replied.\u201cOf course, that\u2019s where I graduated from. It was during my time there that I chose Brolne\u2019s Wisdom, instead of the Theocracy\u2019s Compassion. My time there has had a profound effect on my life.\u201dAs the head of the Ascart House reminisced about his past wistfully, Alicia\u2019s eyes twinkled in excitement, and she began to look forward to her time in Brolne. As for Roel\u2026 well, his face had already turned as pale as a sheet of paper.Studying at Brolne? You must be kidding me! That\u2019s not going to school but leaping right into the blade of a guillotine!Dad, do you know just how many elites on this continent are out for your son\u2019s head? If you really want to send me there, you might as well just prepare my gravesite beforehand too!Roel had hundreds of complaints about this matter, but he couldn\u2019t voice them aloud. He could only force himself to put on a strained smile.Soon, Carter snapped back to the present and continued his explanation.\u201cIf the scholars form one huge coalition of transcendents, the other huge coalition would be the knights.\u201d\u201cKnight Kingdom, Pendor.\u201d\u201cExactly. Knights have different possible Evolution Pathways too, but they have fewer guilds, since the changes that occur to them tend to be more individualistic. The royal family of Pendor is the head of the largest guild, governing the core secrets behind Courage.\u201dRoel nodded silently to his father\u2019s words as he understood some of the deeper meaning implied.Basically speaking, Origin Attributes were key technologies to each country, the secret sustaining their strength. As long as they continued to dominate the secrets of evolution, they would be able to nurture future generations of powerful transcendents.And the Xeclyde House, with the further augmentation of their bloodline, could produce even more powerful transcendents.Darn! Is it too late for me to bootlick Nora now?For a moment there, Roel seriously considered whether he should just sacrifice his body and become a pet, but he quickly dropped the idea. Considering the fact that this world didn\u2019t have organizations like PETA, he felt that it would still be best to rely on himself!4 replies\u00a0\u2013 1 day ago\u201cFather, what is my Origin Attribute then?\u201d\u201cAn Origin Attribute is obtained through a ceremony that requires one to be at Origin Level 5. You\u2019re still Origin Level 7, where most of the fundamental spells are common use. You don\u2019t need an Origin Attribute.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIn other words, I\u2019m too weak that no one wants me. I get it.Roel supplemented in his mind, but the truth was that he was also relieved by the fact he didn\u2019t have an Origin Attribute too.Based on what he had heard thus far, it didn\u2019t seem like it would be possible to switch from one Origin Attribute to another, so it would be dangerous if he already had an Origin Attribute that wasn\u2019t suitable for him.He couldn\u2019t help but recall how the System had scanned his body before replacing the Gold Coin Shop\u2019s stock with all sorts of dark and sinister enhancement tools to \u2018match\u2019 his needs. Judging by that, his constitution was probably as incompatible to the angel\u2019s Compassion and knight\u2019s Courage as one could get.5 replies\u00a0\u2013 1 day agoOf the Three Main Origin Attributes, the only one that stood any hope was Wisdom, but what was more likely to be a fit for him were the heretics\u2019 Origin Attributes. But, if he were to go down that path, he would have to make sure to tread carefully.Ordinary heretics would only be exiled once caught, but if he was found to have ties with some evil cult, there was a chance that he could be executed as an accomplice. This was especially relevant to him since the original Roel had been a member of an evil cult.In order to avoid his death flags, this was something that Roel would have to be extremely careful about.But thinking about it, it would still be best for him not to go to Brolne in the first place. Why in the world did he have to go there to meet the male lead and female leads anyway? It would be so much better to stay right here at the Ascart House and enjoy a blissful life of luxury!\u201cFather, you know the circumstances surrounding me, and I have no interest in the power of transcendents either. I just want to rule over this fiefdom well. Do I really have to go to Brolne?\u201d Roel tried asking.The face of the excited Alicia immediately crumbled, and Carter also shook his head right away.\u201cYou have to go.\u201d\u201cWhy is that so?\u201d\u201cBrolne does provide training for transcendents, but it also provides the core education needed by those making their way in the circle of nobles. The education that you have been through thus far would allow you to pass the examinations with ease, but what\u2019s important here are not your academic results but rather the identity of a graduate and the friends that you would make there.\u201dCarter took a sip of tea as he spoke.\u201cSaint Freya Academy; that\u2019s the place you\u2019ll be going to. It\u2019s the academy where the most talented youths across the Sia Continent gather. The successors to major noble houses of different countries would all be there. As the successor to one of the Theocracy\u2019s Five Eminent Noble Houses, you\u2019ll have to graduate from the academy for the sake of your own reputation.\u201cAs a noble, knowing how to socialize is important, but the friends you make through clinking wine glasses at banquets cannot be compared with classmates who have spent their youth together with you. You might not understand it right now, but you\u2019ll understand once you grow up.\u201dRoel agreed deeply with Carter\u2019s second point. The bonds that were forged at a young age tended to be simpler and purer. Whereas, as adults, there were far too many external factors at play that the innocence of friendship was lost.\u201cThere\u2019s still one last key reason that you have to head to Saint Freya Academy, and that is\u2026\u201dCarter placed down his teacup and looked at his son with a smile.\u201c\u2026 you need to accompany Her Highness Nora.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRoel, who had been calm all this while, found his face twisting in shock upon hearing those words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019re the same age as Her Highness Nora, so it goes without saying that you\u2019ll be going to the academy together with her.\u201d\u201cNo, I get that, but what do you mean by I\u2019ll have to accompany her?\u201dRoel asked with a pale face.After Carter\u2019s explanation, Roel finally understood what was going on. While Saint Freya Academy was a place to learn, the students gathered there were nobles from different countries, so it was inevitable that they would form cliques with those from the same country.Nora, as the princess of the Theocracy, couldn\u2019t possibly be left alone and isolated. So, the nobles who were of the same age as Nora would all be attending Saint Freya Academy together. The plan was to improve their clout and avoid being bullied by others.To put it simply, it was basically just them protecting their royalty.There was no explicit rule saying that the nobles should perform this duty, but everyone would do so anyway. It was a good opportunity to get close to the princess\u2026 and it was free.As the most prestigious academy in all of Brolne, Saint Freya Academy\u2019s enrollment fees were exorbitant, even by the standards of nobility. Some of the lesser houses wouldn\u2019t be able to fork out the money for their children to enroll there. However, in the year that Nora was enrolling, the royal family would be providing scholarships for students who were going to attend Saint Freya Academy.I know that life is tough, but as adults, it\u2019s our responsibility to pave the way for the next generation! Education is a must!Have you heard of Saint Freya Academy? It\u2019s the greatest academy of the entire Sia Continent, the best education that your child can get! Don\u2019t worry, I know that you\u2019re poor, so I\u2019ll fork out money for your children to go to school!Oh right, it just so happens that our princess will be attending that school this year too. Ahahaha, what a coincidence, right? Cough cough\u2026 You get what I\u2019m saying, right?It was at this point that those poor nobles would humbly accept the generous donation while offering great compliments for their royal family. Then, they would return back home and tell their rascals to listen to the princess and serve her like a lackey.This strategy ensured every single member of the Theocracy\u2019s royalty had their own following inside the academy. All they had to do was give a shout and a massive army of followers would be rallied before them. In a sense, this was a guarantee for a wonderful school life free of bullies.Of course, as one of the Five Eminent Noble Houses, the Ascart House wouldn\u2019t lower itself to become lackeys over mere school tuition. Roel would be heading to Saint Freya Academy together with Nora as an aide to help manage her group of followers.This was actually a pretty decent position, since he would be able to make use of this opportunity to recruit young elites and, at the same time, get the royal family to owe him a favor. Besides, being able to build close ties with a member of the royal family while at school could have long-lasting benefits.There were many situations where close aides of the successor to the throne would eventually be promoted into influential positions, working closely with the crown to help manage the country.\u201cI was still a little worried about this initially, but now it seems like everything should be fine. Given how close you and Her Highness Nora have become from your first meeting, I believe the two of you will be able to work very well together! Prince Kane and I are delighted by how things turned out.\u201dCarter\u2019s optimistic attitude formed a stark contrast with Roel\u2019s despairing face. This situation remained till the end of dessert time, when the trio finally returned back to their rooms to rest after a long day.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Roel didn\u2019t head to sleep right away. Instead, he sat on his chair and pondered over everything that had happened earlier in the day. Putting aside the encounter with Nora for now, he did learn a lot about this world through the discussions regarding transcendents and Origin Attributes. Some of the more inexplicable details surrounding the game finally began to make sense.He tried to analyze his current position, and he felt that things were still quite dangerous for him. For one thing, the fact that the strong power he had exerted in the game that turned out to be from an evil cult not acknowledged by the Theocracy had left him feeling quite uneasy.Just where in the world did the original Roel learn that from? Carter\u2019s Origin Attribute was Brolne\u2019s Wisdom, so it definitely was not something passed down through the family\u2019s heritage, and as of yet, Roel hadn\u2019t managed to get in contact with any evil cult members, so far\u2026\u2026 which meant that he would probably meet them in the future.It was likely that there was some event waiting in the future that would lead him astray.The sense that something ominous was going to happen didn\u2019t sit well with Roel, made him feel a little jumpy. He felt that he urgently needed to raise his fighting prowess in order to deal with whatever he would have to face moving forward.I shall send any evil cultists that knock on my door fleeing for their lives!1 reply\u00a0\u2013 5 hours agoHaving made up his mind, Roel began looking for ways to raise his fighting prowess, but he soon realized that before reaching Origin Level 5, the power of transcendents usually grew with age, and this was highly dependent on talent.It was only after reaching Origin Level 5 and obtaining an Origin Attribute that one could use external means to raise one\u2019s Origin Level.So, the issue that Roel faced now was how he could ensure that he grew up properly along with his Origin Level. The convention in this world was to either practice spells or train one\u2019s body, but so far, he had failed to persist in either one.Practicing two incomplete, basic-level spells didn\u2019t interest Roel, and the so-called noble swordsmanship classes were mostly just for show. The teachers that Carter brought in were said to be ex-royal guards of the Theocracy, but it would appear that Roel simply wasn\u2019t cut out for this.It was due to a lack of talent and diligence that resulted in Roel\u2019s pathetically weak state. This would have to change from now on!He would allocate a portion of his time every day to practicing that darned middle-finger spell and would start training up his body as well. He would have to change his attitude toward his swordsmanship training too.And of course, he would put the cheat key he\u2019d been given to full use too.\u3010Lobor Enhancement Serum Type IIA one-time use item produced in the Lobor region, which has been mired in war for many years. One thing to note is that the \u2018one-time use\u2019 refers not to the item but the soldiers consuming it.Side Effects: Accumulation of heat in internal organs, shortening of lifespanPrice: 500 Gold Coins\u30111 reply\u00a0\u2013 1 hour ago\u201c\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euRoel was rendered utterly speechless by this unreliable item inside the Gold Coin Shop, but the reason why this item caught his eye was due to the presence of a complementary item right below.\u3010Lobor Cooling SerumA noble invention indeed, the ray of hope for humanity! Loborians finally don\u2019t have to burn their intestines over their own medicine anymore! It\u2019s such a perfect fit with Lobor Enhancement Serum Type II that some call this item the miracle of the gods! This is an item that is used to raise the talents of youths, and satisfied customers claim that it tastes marvelous when consumed together with Lobor Enhancement Serum Type II.Side Effects: Freezing of bloodline (When consumed individually)Side Effects: None (When consumed with a 1:1 ratio with Lobor Enhancement Serum Type II, after the mixture settles at a brown-red color)Price: 1500 Gold Coins\u3011Looking at the description of the cooling serum, Roel finally managed to calm down a little. Nevertheless, there was still a displeased frown resting on his face.\u201cFeels like an unscrupulous marketing tactic.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 - Steam DiscountPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 25: Steam DiscountRoel had always thought that the items sold at the Gold Coin Shop were extremely bizarre, ranging from the earlier bloodline enhancement item to this serum. Their side effects were so adverse that it really made him wonder who, in their right mind, would consume them.In order not to die from consuming a 500 gold coin enhancement serum, one had to fork out an additional 1500 gold coins?Heh, what a smartass! Is there a worse case of predatory marketing out there in the world? If it\u2019s dangerous, why don\u2019t you just mix the two serums together before selling them then?!Roel heaved a deep sigh before he began to look into this \u2018Lobor\u2019 place. It turned out that there was no such place inside the Theocracy, so Roel chose to ask the home tutor who taught him culture and geography about it.\u201cYoung master, there is a place called Lobor in the world, but it\u2019s located inside the Austine Empire, and I don\u2019t recall any battle ever having occurred there. Perhaps, you might have remembered wrongly?\u201d replied the white-haired, white-bearded old scholar, Flori.Flori was extremely knowledgeable, due to having spent his younger years touring the world, which was also why he was eventually recruited as Roel\u2019s tutor. However, the eyes that he directed toward Roel were filled with disdain.He felt that this wastrel of a scion had simply heard of some rumors about Lobor somewhere and wanted to bring it up to test him, and if he failed to answer the question, the latter would use this matter to kick up a huge fuss.\u201c\u2026 I see. Since that\u2019s the case, let\u2019s proceed with the lesson then, Mister Flori.\u201dSurprisingly, Roel didn\u2019t make use of this opportunity to kick up a fuss. On the contrary, Roel listened attentively during the entire lesson, though he asked quite a bizarre question after the lesson ended.\u201cMister Flori, are there still any world maps remaining from before the Third Epoch?\u201d\u201cMaps before the Spirit Cataclysm of the Capital? I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to find any of those in the open markets. Maps are very valuable, you see. If you\u2019re looking for a map from over a thousand years ago\u2026 I\u2019d say that the only people who could possibly have them are the royal families of each country.\u201d\u201cAh, I understand.\u201dWith a nod, Roel bade this bad-tempered old scholar farewell as he wondered if this \u2018Lobor\u2019 mentioned by the System was a place existing long before the Third Epoch.The migration to the west prior to the inception of the Third Epoch had dealt a huge blow to human culture. Many historical records went missing during that period of time, leaving behind huge gaps in known history. Even a wartorn area which had created quite a formidable serum ended up being forgotten by the world.\u201cA civilization that has already been forgotten, is it?\u201dRoel muttered as he suddenly felt a little forlorn.Perhaps he might be the only one in the world who knew about the war torn Lobor and the bizarre but potent serums that Loborians created.\u201cForget it. There\u2019s no point thinking so much into it. What I should really be thinking of is how I can raise the money to buy the goods.\u201dIt was no time for Roel to be getting sentimental. He needed to quickly raise the money so that he could buy the two serums within one month. There was a legitimate reason why he was in such a rush.\u3010Monthly Special Discounts\u201450% OFF!Lobor Enhancement Serum Type IIPrice: 250 Gold CoinsLobor Cooling SerumPrice: 750 Gold Coins\u3011Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s a time-limited sale at 50% off! I\u2019d be saving a whopping 1000 gold coins!What a coincidence it was that the discounts were on the items that Roel really wanted to get! Even though the price was still exorbitant, so far, he hadn\u2019t heard of any similar medicine being sold within the Theocracy or any other country, so it was likely to be one-of-a-kind.The items in the Gold Coin Shop would refresh once every month, and there would only be a couple of items that would be discounted every single time. If he were to miss this opportunity, he might never get a chance to buy them ever again!He would be a fool if he didn\u2019t make full use of this discount!That being said, 1000 gold coins went far beyond what Roel could afford. One must know that his monthly pocket money was just 20 gold coins! Even if he tried asking Carter for more money, he could probably only get an additional 100 gold coins at most.It should be noted that Carter, as the vice commander of the Holy Knight Order, had a monthly salary of several hundred gold coins, and an ordinary official working in the Holy Capital only earned around 100 gold coins every month.And this was considering the inflation of wages due to the high cost of living inside the Holy Capital!What else can I do then? Should I try robbing a bank or something?Roel racked his brain to think of a solution, and he finally thought of something: Kickstarter!It was not as if Roel really had nothing on him at the moment. He did possess the key to a treasure chest known as the System, but he was just lacking the money to get the treasures out from within.As expensive as the items in the Gold Coin Shop were, they were all good stuff. At the very least, the items provided by the System were still quite reliable, since the side effects were stated very clearly in advance. Furthermore, some of them were even antiques from more than a thousand years ago, making them priceless treasures!To be honest, Roel would prefer not to do this if there were any other options. It went without saying that he wasn\u2019t so foolish as to sell the more dangerous items, but the items generally sold in the System were quite potent. There was no telling if it would lead to some unintended consequences.But well, there was no other choice right now. Time-limited discounts held an irresistible charm that made a person feel as if he would regret it for life once missed, not to mention that the discounts were on the two items that Roel needed too!After convincing himself that this was absolutely necessary, Roel moved on to think of the next question\u2014who should he raise funds from?He needed to find a rich and reliable buyer he could trust. He didn\u2019t want to be scammed into an unprofitable deal, and neither did he want to reveal any personal information. There was one person that he immediately thought of that met all of these conditions\u2014Carter.Good things should, of course, be consumed internally!If it was selling to his own father, Roel would be willing to bring out even the most potent items in the Gold Coin Shop. However, the issue was that it would be hard for him to explain where he got these items from, and it didn\u2019t seem likely that Carter would have any use for most of those sinister-looking stuff.On top of that, most of the items had some degree of danger when using or consuming them, due to the extreme side effects. It would be horrible if he were to land his father in a bad position due to them.In the end, Roel still felt that it would be safer to sell them to an outsider. It was best not to implicate the Ascart House in the transaction of these dangerous items at all.If so, he only had a few choices.The supply chains in this world weren\u2019t as developed as his previous world, so there were few who could afford to dabble in these high-value transactions. All in all, Roel placed them into three categories:First, the other nobles. This was beyond Roel\u2019s means at the moment, since he had no reliable connections in the circle of nobles.Second, the traveling merchant parties that would drop by Ascart City every year. These merchants varied greatly in their financial abilities, and their traveling schedules weren\u2019t fixed.Last but not least, the merchants that were already operating in Ascart City. Of them all, there was only one merchant company that Roel could think of that was trustworthy and had the financial ability to purchase Roel\u2019s goods.And that was the largest merchant organization on the Sia Continent, an organization that spanned across huge swathes of land, the Sorofya Merchant Association.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - The MeagrePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26: The MeagreSorofya.This was a name that no one in Sia Continent didn\u2019t know of.In this world, where the flow of information was severely limited by geographical distance, it was only natural that those who were born in the Austine Empire wouldn\u2019t have heard of the Theocracy\u2019s Xeclydes, and vice-versa with the Austine Empire\u2019s Ackermanns. But the name, Sorofya, was known by almost everyone regardless of which country they were from.And the reason for that was the Sorofya Merchant Association.The merchant association was born in the Rosa Merchant Confederacy, which was located at the heart of the Sia Continent. Its name was derived from the Rosa River that flowed through the entire northeast region.Ease of travel, imparted by the river, and an ideal geographical location, allowed the area to swiftly grow into a trading hub shortly after the inception of the Third Epoch. Despite so, the civilians living there didn\u2019t enjoy good lives.This important trading hub was a strategic military location as well, making it a place countries fought for. To make things worse, Rosaians were incredibly wealthy, which meant that a successful military campaign could very well reap great benefits.As a result of that, Rosa ended up changing hands many times.This tragedy continued until 200 years ago, when Rosa was under the rule of the notorious tyrant emperor of the Austine Empire, Karwen II. The Rosaian merchants were finally unable to tolerate the brutal rule of their colonial masters, so they raised their flags and staged a revolt, eventually leading to the founding of the Rosa Merchant Confederacy.Of course, all was not smooth during the founding of the nation.The few major merchant houses who masterminded the revolution faced immense pressure from the Austine Empire, both militarily and financially. Some of them gave in to the monetary incentive provided by the Austine Empire and backstabbed the revolution, whereas others caved to the military pressure and raised their hands in surrender.There was only one merchant house that continued to persist in its ideals, and that was the Sorofyas.The Sorofya House was the only one that showed backbone amidst all of the money-minded merchants, and it was precisely because of their grit that they suffered the most during those dark times.Indeed, the Sorofyas were the ones who were backstabbed by the other merchant houses. Nearly their entire family was captured by their own allies and handed over to the Austine Empire in exchange for incentives. The only one who managed to escape then was their youngest son.When the Austine Empire attacked Rosa City, they brought all of the Sorofyas out to the frontline and used their lives to threaten the youngest son into opening the city gates and surrendering completely. Yet, the plan was foiled when the obstinate old patriarch ran right into the blade of a sword and committed suicide, choosing death to being used as a hostage.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe death of the Sorofyas\u2019 patriarch meant that the plan to force the youngest son to surrender had failed. Out of rage, the Austine Empire had every single member of the Sorofyas in their capture put to the sword, plunging the remaining survivor of the house, Grimm Sorofya, into great agony. He swore vengeance on the Austine Empire.As future events revealed, the Austine Empire had made a bad move, and they had underestimated the tenacity of the Rosaians as well. This decision plunged them into a bitter war with the Rosaians that lasted for the next decade. They attempted everything they could think of, including massacring entire cities.Yet, the rebels continued to fight them with increasing ferocity.There was even one incident where the rebels were trapped inside Rosa City for seven whole months, resulting in the depletion of their rations. The only food source available in the city then were the few fish and prawns from the river. The grand Ausier Street that was previously known for its splendor had emaciated corpses lying all around.It was during such a moment that a general of the Austine Empire brought out freshly baked bread to entice the people in Rosa City to surrender, and needless to say, the determination of the rebels wavered in the face of such temptation.In this crucial moment, Grimm Sorofya took a sword up to the highest tower in the city and sliced off half of his arm. Holding his bloodied, severed arm, he declared to the city that they could eat him if they were hungry, but they must never surrender to the tyranny of the Austine Empire!Watching such a sight, the populace in Rosa City all broke down into tears as they swore to rather become hungry ghosts inside the city walls than to come under the brutal rule of the empire once more. Faced with their resolution, the countenance of the general of the Austine Empire turned dark. Not too long after, he requested a swap in leadership under the pretext of illness, choosing to retire from the battlefield.After this battle, the Sorofya House truly grew to prominence, allowing it to rally Rosaians under its banner. Despite so, Rosa was simply far too lacking in terms of military power compared to the Austine Empire.As the saying went, \u2018justice may be late, but never absent\u2019. Just as the Rosaians were finally reaching their limits, the Theocracy joined the battlefield.The Austine Empire had used the cruelest of stratagems in order to take down Rosa, and the act of massacring a city was a severe violation of the teachings of the Genesis Goddess Church. Even a common civilian on the streets couldn\u2019t stand seeing the atrocities of the Austine Empire anymore, let alone the Saint Mesit Theocracy.The most important element in a fight between massive countries was timing.The Theocracy immediately launched a precise and deadly strike against the troops of the Austine Empire the moment it joined the battle, not forgetting to claim legitimacy through pinning over a dozen crimes on the empire, including crimes against humanity. At the same time, it also declared the independence of Rosa and provided it with great support.This development turned what should have been some internal strife of the Austine Empire turned into a fight between two powerhouses instead.Having gained the support of the Theocracy, the remnants of the Sorofya House spared no effort in evicting the Austine Empire from their borders. After a prolonged fight, the empire finally gave up on the lucrative land of Rosa and signed a ceasefire with the Sorofya House. With this, the curtains finally closed on a war that had lasted nearly a hundred years.The Sorofya House had paid a heavy price for the founding of the Rosa Merchant Confederacy, losing several generations of its patriarchs in battle. However, their sacrifices were acknowledged by the newly liberated Rosaians, and the Sorofyas were granted the dominant position in Rosa\u2019s politics. It was also then that the Sorofya Merchant Association emerged on the world stage.Over the past hundred years, the Sorofya Merchant Association had managed to permeate every country, turning the Sorofya House into the wealthiest power in the world. They were dubbed as the Uncrowned King due to the massive influence they could potentially exert over any country.The Ascart House was one of the Five Eminent Noble Houses of the Theocracy, and Ascart City was considered one of the more distinguished cities in Saint Mesit. However, as the patriarchs of the Ascart House had mainly dabbled in the military, very little focus had been on the development of commerce. Compared to the cities managed by the other four eminent noble houses, Ascart City could be considered the least prosperous.That being said, it was ranked highest in terms of safety. Only a fool would dare to cause trouble in the territory of a powerhouse who had a powerful army under his command. As such, the populace of Ascart City lived a rather peaceful life. Merchants favored such stable environments, and naturally, the Sorofya Merchant Association wouldn\u2019t pass Ascart City by.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cYoung master, this is the latest winter collection of the Sorofya Merchant Association.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dInside a resting room, Anna handed a large but not bulky catalog into the hands of the black-haired boy, Roel. He had just ended his daily swordsmanship training, and after receiving the catalog, he began flipping through it.This catalog, designed in a similar fashion to the menus of high-class restaurants in Roel\u2019s previous world, contained a list of the Sorofya Merchant Association\u2019s recent masterpieces. It included a picture and description for each product, allowing the customers to grasp a better understanding of what they were going to purchase.The Sorofyas had a deep understanding of the customers they were dealing with, fully grasping how much nobles valued their reputation and loved comparing with one another. The wealthier nobles, in order to flaunt their affluence, tended to purchase the entire catalog in a breath. The Ascart House was not lacking in money, but being without a matriarch, it didn\u2019t have much use for the items inside.The dress that Nora was wearing the other day was also ordered from the Sorofyas, which showed just how far-reaching its influence was.Roel couldn\u2019t help but feel a little overwhelmed as he browsed through the winter collection. Even the leather cover of the catalog felt like an extravagance to him.This little booklet must have cost at least one goin coin, right? Haaa, it\u2019s no wonder why the Sorofyas are able to rake in the big bucks.Roel couldn\u2019t help but wonder just how much the Sorofya Merchant Association was actually earning as he continued flipping through the collection.There was one thing he was looking for in here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 - What Else Could She Possibly LikePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 27: What Else Could She Possibly LikeThere was a huge assortment of items to Sorofya\u2019s latest winter collection, ranging from cosmetic products\u2014that had all sorts of bizarre ingredients in them but boasted miraculous effects\u2014to daily necessities, jewelry, perfume, and even unique food and drinks. There was nothing lacking at all.As for clothes, the catalog only detailed the fabric available and the names of the designer and embroiderer; the design itself wasn\u2019t shown in the catalog.One of the most awkward situations that could happen amongst noblewomen was for them to be caught wearing identical clothes to a banquet.For this reason, the designer would pay a visit to the customer\u2019s house for measurements and fittings, and they would design a set of clothing specific to the individual. This way, they would be able to ensure that every single article of clothing was unique.The dress that Alicia wore during Nora\u2019s visit was a gift that Carter gave her when she first came to the Ascart House. Even Roel had to admit that it was quite a spectacular dress. It was now the little girl\u2019s most prized possession.That being said, Roel didn\u2019t get Anna to bring the catalog over to look at these items. The items inside the catalog were all quite amazing, but he was only interested in the very final page of the catalog\u2014the request list.One of the business functions of merchant associations was to purchase goods, and the request list was essentially items the Sorofyas were seeking to purchase.It was not uncommon for nobles to have special requests for the merchant, and the request list was created with the purpose to fulfill these requests.Take for example if Roel wanted a scented soap right now but it wasn\u2019t available in Ascart City or its vicinity. What he could do was leave a request for an item, something \u2018scented and capable of cleansing the body\u2019. Once the Sorofya Merchant Association received the request, they would place it on their catalog\u2019s request list and purchase it from other regions in the Theocracy or even other countries.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was possible for the item that was eventually procured to not be a scented soap but, perhaps, a stone that fulfilled the same criteria.Only major customers were allowed to make these requests, and they would have to place a deposit with the merchant association first. After the transaction was made, a commission fee would be collected by the merchants. It was basically a special service provided to its VIPs to satisfy them.There were two reasons why Roel wanted to sell his item through this request list:First, the ones who placed these requests were high-net-worth individuals, so the prices they offered would usually be much higher as compared to the prices merchant associations offered.Second, this request list was anonymous, be it the buyer or the seller. Only the Sorofya Merchant Association would know the identities of those involved in the transaction, and for the last few decades, there had never been any instance where it was caught leaking the confidential information of its clients.To summarize, it was profitable and safe!That being said, there was still one condition that couldn\u2019t be avoided. Roel needed there to be a request for an item with criteria matching what the System could fulfill. It would really take quite a great deal of luck.To his delight, there was actually one request on the list that was compatible with what was available in the Gold Coin Shop!Request Criteria: Has the effect of calming souls, suppresses the power of hexes, and prevents corpse reanimation.Roel took a careful look at the criteria before turning to look at his System\u2019s Gold Coin Shop.\u3010Sarchorme\u2019s Soul-calming LampAn oil lamp created by Priest Sarchorme. It brings peace to those who have returned to Mother Earth, so there\u2019s no fear of weird things crawling back out. The effect lasts till the oil runs out.Price: 5000 Gold Coins\u3011\u201c\u2026\u201dSeems like it\u2019ll work?Roel stroked his chin as he looked to and fro between the request criteria and the description of Sarchorme\u2019s Soul-calming Lamp.Name itself contained \u2018Soul-calming\u2019\u2014 \u2713 .Prevention of corpse reanimation\u2014 \u2713 .All that was left was the part about suppressing hexes.Well, if the effect of the hex was the reanimation of corpses, arguably, the lamp could be said to have the effect of suppressing hexes, right?Suppression of hexes\u2014 \u2713.Nodding to himself, Roel placed the catalog down on the table as he began contemplating how he should go about doing it.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cFather, I would like to make a trip over to the Sorofya Merchant Association.\u201d\u201cHm? Is there something that you would like to buy? You can just send a servant over to place the order.\u201dInside Carter\u2019s study, Roel\u2019s father looked somewhat perplexed by his son\u2019s request.As a spoiled young master, used to getting what he wanted simply by commanding his servants to do it for him, Roel had never needed to head to the merchant association before. Sending over a purchase order was just a small errand anyway, so it was fine to leave it to a servant.To be honest, Roel could have chosen to head there without informing Carter beforehand, but it would have likely incurred Carter\u2019s suspicion. So, in order to not undo the trust he had built up recently, he decided that it was best to consult Carter about it first.\u201cActually\u2026 I\u2019m not buying something for myself.\u201dRoel appeared to ponder for a moment before rubbing his hands together awkwardly and replying with a slightly embarrassed look. This reaction immediately hooked Carter\u2019s curiosity.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be winter soon, but I haven\u2019t gotten Alicia any welcome gift ever since she joined our house. So, I\u2019m hoping to personally browse through the recent additions the Sorofyas\u2019 have in stock and get her something she\u2019d like.\u201d\u201cAhhh, I see.\u201dCarter put down his pen as he looked at his own son in surprise. He didn\u2019t think that it was possible for his son to change by so much in just a few short months. To think that he would actually know how to care for someone else!Having a younger sibling to take care of does make one mature!(Affection Points +200!)With a green light flashing over his head, Carter nodded with a wide smile of approval.\u201cIt\u2019s an excellent idea. Go ahead then, I\u2019ll pass the money to Anna.\u201d\u201cThanks, father, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201dHaving succeeded in his plan, Roel quickly thanked his father before turning around to walk out of the study gleefully.With this single move, I got money, a wave of Affection Points, and managed to conceal my reason for heading to the Sorofya Merchant Association. This is killing three birds with one stone!As expected of me!But while Roel was celebrating his little victory in his heart, Carter suddenly called for him.\u201cWait a moment.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dThe sound of a chair being pushed backward sounded, and Carter stood up from his desk. He took a close, intent look at Roel, to the point that the latter started to sweat a little.W-what is going on? Did he notice something amiss?Recalling how his father possessed transcendent powers, Roel\u2019s heart skipped a beat as he waited nervously for Carter\u2019s following words.\u201cYou\u2019re heading there to buy something for Alicia, right?\u201d\u201cYes, I am.\u201d\u201cYou can take your time and have a good look at the items they have. You\u2019ll have to prepare another gift on top of Alicia\u2019s\u2026 Her Highness\u2019 birthday is coming up soon.\u201d\u201cAlrig\u2026 What?\u201dRoel, who was just about to reply by reflex, suddenly processed what Carter was saying and halted in shock.\u201cHer Highness?\u201d\u201cYes, Her Highness Nora. You had a high fever last year, so you weren\u2019t able to attend Her Highness\u2019 birthday banquet. No matter what happens, you have to attend this year to make up for it.\u201d\u201cT-this\u2026\u201d\u201cUsually, since we\u2019re from the same house, it\u2019d do for us to just send one gift. But, now that you\u2019re friends with Her Highness, and considering that you were absent last year, it would be best for you to give her a personal gift this time around\u2026 It\u2019s settled then!\u201dCarter clapped his hands together and ended the discussion there. The gleam in his eyes showed that he was very satisfied with himself for having been able to think of this, but meanwhile, Roel\u2019s face had already started scrunching up bitterly.Dad, can you stop talking nonsense? Who\u2019s friends with who? How can you trust that woman\u2019s words?!\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be too valuable. It\u2019s best if you could choose something that\u2019s in line with Her Highness\u2019 preferences,\u201d said Carter with a smile.Something that Nora likes and shouldn\u2019t be too valuable\u2026It was almost frightening how an answer immediately surfaced in Roel\u2019s mind. He couldn\u2019t help muttering to himself.\u201cA dog leash.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - Let\u2019s See Who I Should Rip OffPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 28: Let\u2019s See Who I Should Rip OffArwen Dani felt that he had led quite a successful life.Forty this year, he was born in Rosa and had the trademark red hair of a Rosaian. In his earlier years, he had traveled cross country in a merchant convoy, touring the many nations of the continent. It was only in his thirties that he finally returned to Rosa to take on greater responsibilities within the association. At this moment, he was already the manager of Sorofya Merchant Association\u2019s Ascart City Branch.As one of the few branch managers of the illustrious Sorofya Merchant Association in the Theocracy, Arwen\u2019s standing was even above that of lesser nobles. Only the most distinguished customers were worthy of being attended to by him.And the black-haired boy sitting before him right now was one of them.\u201cYoung master Roel, the two sets of clothes you have ordered will only be arriving in half a month\u2019s time. We\u2019ll have our people deliver them to the Ascart House. As for the short sword you requested, I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019ll take slightly longer; roughly three months.\u201dInside an exquisitely adorned room, a black-suited Arwen looked at the adorable yet handsome little boy seated opposite to him, as he explained the situation with an amiable smile. The comfortable vibe that he emanated showed how deserving he was of the manager\u2019s position.A slight aroma wafted from the highest quality red tea being served in elaborately designed Rosaian teacups on the table. Roel leaned comfortably on a soft sofa as he took a sip of the tea and remarked calmly.\u201cThe tea is not bad.\u201d\u201cHaha, it\u2019s only appropriate of us to serve you with the best of teas. I wouldn\u2019t bear to drink such precious tea under normal occasions.\u201dTsk tsk, only a kid would believe those words of yours!Roel continued smiling calmly while retorting disdainfully to Arwen\u2019s remark in his mind.Sorofya was known for its wealth, so how could a high-standing branch manager possibly be unable to afford tea? It was as good as saying that a fish was drowning in water!This was a common tactic that merchants used, buttering the customer up to high heavens before ripping them off and taking all their money. It was particularly effective on naive youths or proud nobles who would go to all lengths to uphold their pride. Unfortunately for Arwen, Roel fit into neither of the two categories.You have a glib tongue, but you might as well spare the effort. You\u2019re a hundred years too late to be taking advantage of me!Roel put down his teacup calmly. Paying no heed to Arwen\u2019s flattery, he began speaking.\u201cIt\u2019s not an issue, three months is fine. These are just minor issues. I didn\u2019t call you here for a private chat to verify these trifles.\u201d\u201cI understand. Young master Roel, please feel free to speak your mind. We\u2019ll prepare anything you need.\u201dArwen still had an amicable smile on his face, making it appear as if he would be more than willing to do anything to help, but on the inside, he was already starting to feel contempt for Roel.Yet another dirty deal. I\u2019ve long heard that the son of Marquess Carter is a wastrel, but I didn\u2019t think that he would get involved with that kind of stuff at such a young age.Let me take a guess what it is this time. Is it the mirage grass or the euphoric beat? Or is it women that he wants?Arwen pondered as he made up his mind to find an excuse to send Roel off.While the Sorofya Merchant Association did deal with a wide variety of stuff, there were explicit rules forbidding the sales of such items within the Theocracy. It was one thing if Roel was the marquess himself\u2014Arwen might have still considered going through with the trade to fawn on him\u2014but Roel was only a successor at the moment.One should know that Carter was a model noble, as well as a powerful transcendent. There was no way he would allow his own son to get involved in this sort of stuff. If Carter were to investigate this matter, Arwen would fall into deep trouble.However, Arwen\u2019s expectations were doomed to fall flat this time around.\u201cI wish to sell an item listed on your request list.\u201d\u201cRequest list?\u201dArwen blinked his eyes, a little surprised that this young boy was actually here to sell something to him. However, his surprise only lingered for a moment before his professional smile swiftly returned to his face.\u201cAhh, so that\u2019s the case. May I ask which request criteria does the item you are selling fulfill?\u201d\u201cRequest 172. Has the effect of calming souls, suppressing the spread of curses, and preventing corpse reanimation.\u201dRoel calmly recited the text he recalled from the catalog, causing Arwen, who was just about to flip through the catalog himself, to freeze on the spot. His eyes narrowed for a split second.\u201c\u2026 Hahaha, young master Roel\u2019s memory sure is amazing! Yes, there\u2019s indeed such an item that we\u2019re urgently trying to procure at the moment.\u201dArwen put on an act of flipping through the catalog, but in truth, his heart was already thumping in excitement after hearing Roel\u2019s words.Others might not know who the buyer was, but Arwen, as a manager, was privy to some information not known by outsiders. This was a request issued directly from the central headquarters in Rosa, which meant that the buyer behind this Request 172 was likely to be one of his higher-ups.All of a sudden, this seemingly insignificant transaction had turned into something so important that it could influence Arwen\u2019s future career in the merchant association.It looked as if nothing had changed on the surface, but the sharp glint in Arwen\u2019s eyes showed that he was finally getting serious.\u201cYoung master Roel, may I ask where the item is?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s currently at my home. If negotiations go well, I\u2019ll drop by tomorrow and deliver the item into your hands.\u201d\u201cI understand. Pardon me when I ask this question, but how much of the listed criteria does your item fulfill?\u201d\u201cI can guarantee that my item fulfills the criteria of calming souls and preventing undead reanimation. As for the suppression of curses, that remains to be seen.\u201dAs Roel quickly explained the effects of the Soul-calming Lamp, he paid close attention to the fluctuations in Arwen\u2019s emotions. While the latter had an excellent poker face, he was unable to conceal the keen look in his eyes after hearing Roel\u2019s description.\u201cIt\u2019s an item I found inside our Ascart House\u2019s vault. My father doesn\u2019t agree with me selling it, but you should have also heard about how I am lacking in talent as a transcendent. Those bizarre items inside our storage room are of no use to me anyway, so I might as well exchange them for something more practical instead, don\u2019t you agree?\u201dRoel put a disdainful look on his face, perfectly playing out the part of a standard good-for-nothing scion.Arwen couldn\u2019t help but sneer on the inside upon seeing Roel\u2019s attitude, but on the outside, he nodded vehemently in agreement.\u201cIndeed, what you\u2019ve said makes perfect sense. Useless items do nothing more than collect dust; it\u2019s a good idea to trade them for gold coins now and purchase the things you really need. It\u2019d do just to buy them back once more when you are in need of them.\u201dArwen played along to Roel\u2019s tune and even developed on his point, neglecting to explain to the \u2018naive little boy\u2019 how items that possessed transcendent powers tended to be rare and incredibly hard to source for in the market.Roel nodded his head vehemently upon hearing Arwen\u2019s words, looking as if he couldn\u2019t agree more.\u201cI knew that Mister Arwen would understand me. My father is simply too stubborn. What\u2019s the use of keeping those scraps back at home? If it was me, I would have had all of them sold by now!\u201dRoel waved his hand grandly, as if he couldn\u2019t wait to dispose of the vast collection the Ascart House had accrued over the years.Those words sparked a flame in Arwen\u2019s heart.The treasure collection of a long-standing magician house like the Ascarts was not to be underestimated. They were bound to have many rare and exclusive antiques, and those items were not things that one could buy even if one had the money! If he could seal this deal, it would be all worth it, no matter how much money he had to spend!Besides, when had the Sorofyas ever lacked money? That was the one thing that they could confidently declare that they had in excess!And in truth, the Sorofya Merchant Association had a special task for all of its branch managers, and that was to collect all sorts of mystical treasures from all over the world. There were some branch managers who spent years trying to get close to declining nobles in hopes of acquiring the treasures they had.They knew that as long as they could seal the deal, their promotion would be guaranteed.Be it the fulfillment of Request 172 or the Ascart House\u2019s treasures, they were all invaluable opportunities to Arwen, such that he was already having trouble trying to maintain his poker face. He gulped down a mouthful of saliva as he asked with a hint of agitation.\u201cYoung master Roel, what do you think would be an appropriate price for the item you wish to sell?\u201d\u201cThis is our first time working together, so I need to bring back a sum of money that my father can look at.\u201dRoel\u2019s eyes darted upward contemplatively for a moment before he finally gave his offer with a smile.\u201c50,000 gold coins, how does that sound?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - War of WordsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29: War of Words50,000 gold coins?It was as if a pail of cold water had been poured over the flame in Arwen\u2019s heart as soon as he heard the \u2018deal\u2019 Roel was offering him. He stared at Roel in utter bafflement, his first instinct being to refute the ridiculous price. However, being a professional, he reminded himself that he was dealing with a kid here and quickly calmed himself down.\u201cYoung master Roel, you might be unfamiliar with the market price, but the amount you\u2019re requesting is too high.\u201dArwen rubbed his palms together awkwardly as he spoke with a conflicted look on his face.\u201c50,000 gold coins is already enough to buy a house inside the Holy Capital. For a single item, this price is far too exorbitant. Even a full set of inscribed armor wouldn\u2019t be that expensive.\u201d\u201cInscribed armor? Excuse me, but are you trying to compare a treasure of our Ascart House to a mass produced good?\u201d bellowed Roel furiously.Putting his notoriety as a little tyrant to good use, he slammed his fist on the table imposingly.\u201cHow can that sort of trash possibly be put on the same level as what I\u2019m offering here? My father told me that it\u2019s a one-of-a-kind good, worth at least tens of thousands!\u201dRoel didn\u2019t hesitate to pull out Carter\u2019s name to heap pressure on Arwen.Hearing those words, the conflicted look on Arwen\u2019s face deepened as he replied anxiously.\u201cBut young master Roel, we haven\u2019t gotten an opportunity to see the item you are offering us yet. I\u2019m afraid that the price you\u2019re asking for is far beyond our current budget\u2026\u201d\u201cMister Arwen, I can guarantee its effects. If the item doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll give you a full refund right away. I have already put my name out there as a show of my sincerity, so how much are you willing to offer for my artifact?\u201dSeeing how far Roel was willing to go to vouch for his item, Arwen quickly began reassessing the current situation.The acceptable price range listed by central headquarters for Request 172 was 0 to 20,000 gold coins, but the Sorofya Merchant Association had a rule where the branches purchasing the item could take the price difference as commission in order to encourage them to be more proactive in their procurement of requested items.In view of this clause, most branches would have offered 15,000 gold coins at most so that they could take the remaining 5,000 gold coins for themselves.However, in view of a possible long-term partnership with Roel on the sales of the Ascart House\u2019s treasures, Arwen decided to offer a more favorable deal to him. He pondered for a moment before finally speaking up.\u201cI think that 18,000 gold coins is an appropriate price. Young master Roel, what do you say?\u201dArwen nervously looked at the little boy before him, who appeared to not know the rules of the industry. He was worried that the latter would blow his top upon hearing the massive price difference from the initial offer. That being said, Arwen had also dealt with his fair share of difficult customers over the years, so he was confident in his ability to persuade Roel to accept his offered price.But, contrary to his expectations, Roel placed his cup of tea down on the table, stood up, and began walking out of the guest suite without saying a word at all.\u201cEh? W-wait a moment, young master Roel! Where are you going?\u201dArwen immediately rose to his feet and moved quickly to block the exit of the black-haired boy.\u201cMister Arwen, I\u2019m having reservations about your sincerity. The price you have offered me isn\u2019t even half of my initial offer.\u201d\u201cYoung master Roel, I assure you that I have no intention of scamming you. Your initial offer is simply too high. 18,000 gold coins is the limit of what we can offer you.\u201dArwen spoke with a face that was as sincere as possible. It was almost as if he wouldn\u2019t be earning a single gold coin out of this deal at all.Roel looked at Arwen quietly for a moment before he nodded his head with a smile of realization.Son of a banshee, you must be thinking that I\u2019m a helpless prey on your chopping board, huh? Very well, I shall show you the right way to negotiate a deal!\u201cI see. It would appear that the scale of the Ascart City Branch is still too small.\u201dDisappointment flickered across Roel\u2019s face as he stepped forward and patted Arwen\u2019s chest lightly.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cMister Arwen, I know that the financial ability of your branch is limited, so I won\u2019t make things difficult for you. Here, I\u2019ll be heading to the Holy Capital for Her Highness\u2019 birthday soon, and I believe that the Sorofya Merchant Association\u2019s Saint Mesit Theocracy Headquarters should have the capacity to fulfill my demands.\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dThose words made Arwen widen his eyes as cold sweat began dripping down his back.Wait a moment, this isn\u2019t how the story is supposed to go.If what Roel mentioned was real, Arwen would not just be missing out on two massively lucrative transactions for his branch, his evaluation inside the merchant association would also be utterly ruined!In truth, the Sorofya Merchant Association\u2019s Saint Mesit Theocracy Headquarters, as lengthy and formidable as the name sounded, was only half a tier above the Ascart City Branch. They would surely be tempted by the profits that Roel could potentially bring them and very possibly offer him a sweet deal.Then, once Arwen\u2019s rivals learned that he had screwed up this deal at his own branch, it was certain that they would blow up this matter so as to get rid of an inside competitor.Would the successor to the Ascart House travel all the way to the Holy Capital to sell his items for no reason? Not to mention, this was an item requested by the central headquarters, so they would surely take this matter very seriously.By then, he would be stuck with a label of incompetence.Arwen couldn\u2019t accept such an outcome, especially given that the manager of the Saint Mesit Theocracy Headquarters was his \u2018old friend\u2019 who had taken \u2018very good care\u2019 of him in his younger years.That decided it. Arwen grit his teeth and made up his mind.\u201cYoung master Roel, please calm down for a moment. Why don\u2019t we do this instead? As long as there\u2019s nothing wrong with the item after inspection, I\u2019ll fork out 25,000 gold coins for it.\u201dAfraid that Roel would turn him down, he took two gasps of air before he continued his persuasion.\u201cI know that this price might be insufficient to satisfy you, but I can tell you honestly that the highest estimated price for Request 172 is only 20,000 gold coins. I\u2019m offering the additional 5,000 gold coins out of my own pocket, as a gesture of friendship. I can swear on the name of Sia that not even the Saint Mesit Theocracy Headquarters can offer you this price.\u201dHearing Arwen\u2019s vow, Roel\u2019s expression finally alleviated a little. He took his time to ponder the offer before slowly returning back to his seat. He stared at the cunning businessman before him for a moment longer before finally acceding with a nod.\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll trust you since you have gone to the extent of swearing on Sia\u2019s name. Let\u2019s go with the price that you\u2019ve proposed then. However, I have two conditions.\u201d\u201cGo ahead and state them.\u201d\u201cFirst, I wish to receive one-fifth of the money in advance as a deposit to bring back to my father. Second, due to some reasons, my father doesn\u2019t want anyone else to know that these goods are coming from our Ascart House. So, we won\u2019t be signing any agreements or acknowledging this transaction at all. I expect the highest level of confidentiality from you.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand. You don\u2019t need to worry. Our Sorofya Merchant Association is renowned for its world-class confidentiality, so you can be assured that no one else will know about this transaction.\u201dArwen was overjoyed to see that he had managed to convince Roel. He continued to discuss the details with Roel over tea before handing Roel a box of money and walking him out of the merchant association.\u201cAnna, Mister Arwen said that a new batch of goods will be coming in tomorrow, so we\u2019ll be dropping by again tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYes, young master. I\u2019ll make arrangements accordingly.\u201dAfter issuing instructions to Anna, Roel got into the carriage before bidding Arwen farewell.\u201cI\u2019ll be seeing you tomorrow then, Mister Arwen.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Inside the carriage traveling homeward, Roel fondled the box filled with gold coins as he thought over the earlier exchange he had with Arwen. Fortunately, he managed to exploit his young age and tyrannical reputation to his advantage during negotiations.As an ignorant and reckless scion of the powerful Ascart House, it was his entitlement to be unreasonable, and this made it incredibly difficult for the rational Arwen to deal with him. For one, Arwen had no problem believing that Roel would sell his stuff over at the Holy Capital in his anger.In truth, Roel couldn\u2019t afford to wait till Nora\u2019s birthday and make the trade over at the Holy Capital. He needed to settle it this month.However, there was no way Arwen could have known that. For the sake of securing the \u2018treasures of the Ascart House\u2019 for himself, he chose to take a loss on the first deal in order to build up a friendly working relationship.Unfortunately for him though, Roel had no plans of continuing his trade with the Sorofyas.It was risky for him to pull things out of nowhere and throw them in the market, as it could catch unwanted attention in the long-run. Furthermore, he wouldn\u2019t be able to explain it to his father, Carter, if the latter were to learn of it. However, if it was just one item\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s just a Soul-calming Lamp, and it\u2019s the first time I\u2019m doing this. I can\u2019t be so unlucky as to get done-in on the first time, right?\u201d muttered Roel optimistically.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 - Money to Buy Happiness!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 30: Money to Buy Happiness!A week later, Roel sat in his room as he stared at the two brand-new winter coats folded neatly in wooden boxes in front of him.These winter coats were of different sizes, the larger one being for a guy and the smaller one being for a girl. These were the clothes that Roel had personally ordered at the Sorofyas a week ago.It was worth noting that the larger winter coat was bought not for Roel himself but as a gift for Carter.While he was shopping at the Sorofyas, he suddenly recalled that in his ten years in the Ascart House, not once had he ever bought anything for his own father before. Feeling a bit guilty about this, Roel decided to use the money that he had earned to order a coat for Carter. In a sense, this was a small token of appreciation for everything his father had done for him over all these years.It appeared that Arwen viewed Roel as a VVIP, due to the transaction they had, resulting in the former using everything within his power to ensure the service provided was to Roel\u2019s satisfaction. As such, the clothes that were supposed to be due in half a month\u2019s time were delivered in just a week\u2026\u2026 though what was important here was the sparkling golden heap buried beneath the clothes.Gold coins. 20,000 of them, to be exact.It was the final payment for the item Roel sold via the request list.A week ago, as soon as Roel brought the deposit home with him, he exchanged it for Sarchorme\u2019s Soul-calming Lamp through the Gold Coin Shop.The lamp was molded with some sort of dark brown dirt, and the oil inside was dark red in color, seemingly made out of some sort of mysterious substance. Roel tried lighting the lamp up, and the flame produced by the lamp released a pure white glow that brought him inner peace.Perhaps this was how enlightenment felt.The following day, Roel passed the Soul-calming Lamp over to Arwen for testing. The results appeared to be satisfactory as Arwen squealed in delighted that the item Roel brought over had far surpassed what they had asked for.Arwen thought that something as valuable as the Soul-calming Lamp was bound to be some sort of family heirloom, and he felt deeply relieved that he had decisively gone through with the transaction yesterday and didn\u2019t let this treasure slip through his fingers.His attitude toward Roel also became much more amicable than before, and he indicated that he would try to send the final payment over as soon as possible.\u201cYep, he did manage to deliver it here quite quickly,\u201d muttered Roel as he picked up a fistful of coins.The process would usually require quite some time, as the item would first have to be delivered to the branch where the buyer made the request from, then the buyer would collect the item and submit payment for it. Only after the payment had been confirmed could the money be released to the seller.Considering how transportation was an issue in this world, it was amazing how they could clear the administrative process within just a single week.Roel was quite satisfied with how things turned out. He was initially planning to raise just 1000 gold coins to purchase the two serums in the Gold Coin Shop, but he ended up profiting an eye-popping 20,000 gold coins from the sales instead.With such money, one could buy a huge house in a prime location in the Holy Capital!To make a comparison, the Ascart House, as one of the Five Eminent Noble Houses, should have a networth of at least 10 million gold coins, if one were to factor in the span of its territory and all of its properties. However, most of these were fixed assets that couldn\u2019t be liquidated easily.The amount of money that the Ascart House was really able to bring out was around several hundred thousand gold.Given so, Roel could already be considered a mini tycoon in Ascart City, and that was just from a single transaction.Roel was the type of person who relished in seeing his bank account balance increase day by day, and he would rather take a dagger to his heart than watch his money disappear like water through a broken faucet. However, he knew that the small fortune he had just built up would soon disappear in the endless abyss known as the Gold Coin Shop, and it anguished him greatly.It was regrettable, but Roel knew clearly what he was working for. No amount of money was worth his life. Besides, would he have to worry about having no money when he was finally strong?Roel assuaged his aching heart by telling himself time and time again that this money was going to good use before finally stowing it away in his private little treasure vault. Then, he picked up the two winter coats he had bought and headed out of his room.It just so happened that Carter was taking a break today and was in the mansion. Otherwise, he would have to wait another week before giving it to him.Roel first headed over to Alicia\u2019s room.The etiquette lesson Alicia had earlier in the morning had tired her out, so she was currently taking a break at the moment. Nevertheless, Roel\u2019s arrival still brought a bright smile to her face right away.\u201cGood morning, Lord Brother,\u201d said Alicia as she stood up and curtsied.Her movements were dignified but, at the same time, so unbearably adorable as well. Seeing this brought a faint smile to Roel\u2019s lips too.\u201cMorning, Alicia. Your etiquette lesson must have been tiring. Here, I have a gift for you.\u201dWith a wave of his hand, Anna immediately brought a beautifully designed wooden box forward. The logo of the Sorofya Merchant Association and the autograph of the designer were carved onto the wooden box, making it look simplistically classy and exclusive.The box also carried the scent of a perfume that Sorofyas\u2019 was marketing at the moment, a deliberate yet natural way to advertise their other products.I really do wonder who is the one behind all of these marketing tricks. He\u2019s a true business prodigy!While Roel\u2019s thoughts were wandering all over, Alicia clasped her mouth in sheer delight upon seeing the packaging. It was common knowledge that tailored clothes from the Sorofya Merchant Association were expensive. However, their unique and fashionable designs were hard for any woman to resist, such that even the sensible Alicia would be captivated by their beauty.\u201cBig brother, this is\u2026?\u201d\u201cI realized that I have never given you a welcome gift ever since you arrived at the Ascart House. I\u2019m belatedly making up for that.\u201d\u201cThank you, I love it!\u201dThe delighted Alicia leaped into Roel\u2019s embrace and cuddled up against his chest like a silver cat. A wave of high-value Affection Points shot out from her head.The maids in the vicinity watched the loving siblings with slight smiles on their lips as green light rose over their heads as well, especially for Anna, who was producing substantial numbers.However, Roel didn\u2019t pay any heed to the points. He was fully indulging in Alicia\u2019s warm hug as he felt a surge of healing energy gushing into his heart.Oooooh, how cute! I feel like I\u2019m being born anew!Roel had been stressing himself out having to raise money and build up his physical stamina. He now felt his anxious heart gradually calm down as his burdens were lifted away. He had never known that a hug could be so therapeutic; he would pay any amount of money to experience it again.This hug only lasted for a short while before a maid, under the piercing glare of her colleagues, nervously interjected into this warm atmosphere to usher Alicia for her next lesson. Roel bade his adopted sister farewell before heading off to knock on the door of his father\u2019s room.To his astonishment, his meeting with his father caused an even greater commotion.When Roel told Carter that he had used his money to buy him a winter jacket and passed a wooden box over, the great marquess, he actually started crying!\u201cMaria, you can rest at ease now. Our child has matured. He even knows how to buy me a gift now!\u201dCarter opened the locket that he wore around his neck and began crying to the portrait of Roel\u2019s deceased mother, leaving Roel feeling somewhat amused yet ultimately melancholic.Listening half-heartedly as Carter began nagging at him once more, Roel felt something settling down in his heart. It was the comfort coming from a father\u2019s love.While Roel did possess the memories of his previous life, it didn\u2019t change the fact that Carter was his father.Carter had to raise Roel up alone after his wife died a premature death, and the journey to parenthood hadn\u2019t been easy for him. Roel\u2019s willfulness often left him with splitting headaches, and the knowledge that Roel was lacking the talent to become a transcendent made him feel deep self-reproach. But, despite the difficulties along the way, he had never given up on Roel. He continued to plan carefully for his son\u2019s future to ensure that his son would be able to live a peaceful life ahead.In truth, if it was just over the succession of the Ascarts\u2019 lineage, there was no need for Carter to go through so much trouble. He could have just married another wife and born a few more offspring; that was the \u2018normal thing\u2019 other nobles would have done. However, Carter chose not to do so, because of his deep love for his deceased wife and Roel.While Roel had cursed at having been put into the tragic role of a soon-to-be-killed villain, he felt that it was a great blessing of the world for him to have been born into the Ascart House and to Carter.While feeling all warm and fuzzy inside, Roel gave his farewells to his father before heading back to his room. Seeing the smiles on the faces of his family members made him feel more energized than ever.Now that he was fully recharged both in body and soul, it was time for him to get to the main show\u2014the two serums.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 - Happenings In the ShadowsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 31: Happenings In the ShadowsWhat should one do before drinking medicine?Roel wouldn\u2019t say that he was an expert on this topic. He recalled how martial artists in his previous world had a habit of meditating under a waterfall for several days in order to reach their peak state. However, it seemed like this world didn\u2019t share that custom, though it was not as if Roel would do it anyway.Some might pray to the gods and wish for everything to go well. However, seeing how Roel was dealing with some dark and sinister stuff here, he didn\u2019t think that the gods of this world would be willing to give him their blessing.Forget it, I\u2019ll just gulp it down and get it over and done with!Roel stared at the two bottles of serum that he had spent 1000 gold coins to acquire from the Gold Coin Shop\u2014Lobor Enhancement Serum Type II and Lobor Cooling Serum. The former was a bottle of viscous black fluid that looked no different from crude oil while the latter looked a teeny bit tamer with its dark blue color.He uncapped the two bottles and began pouring them into a glass cup.To his surprise, the black viscous fluid flowed smoothly like water whereas the tamer dark blue fluid flowed slowly like a thick molten caramel. The two fluids began to effervesce upon contact, as if some sort of sinister chemical reaction was taking place.Roel eyed the color of the mixture carefully as he recalled the description of the items.\u201cI\u2019ll be able to drink it once the color settles at dark red\u2026\u201dTime ticked by as Roel observed the mixture patiently. Around ten minutes later, the mixture inside the glass cup finally turned dark red, and the effervescence had stopped too.Roel picked up the cup and took a sniff. He could smell a scent similar to orange juice in it.\u201cSystem, is this fine? Can I drink it now?\u201d\u3010Scanning object\u2026\u3011\u3010Color matches. Reaction matches. The serum is ready for consumption.\u3011\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. But still, it feels so odd for something with the texture of milk to have the smell of oranges\u2026 Forget it, cheers!\u201dRoel swirled the fluid inside the glass cup lightly before tilting his head back and gulping down this serum mixture that had cost him 1000 gold coins.Its texture is thick like gravy, and it has a weird taste too. The slight orangey scent does mellow down the weirdness a little, making it at least palatable.For those inquisitive minds out there, this was Roel\u2019s commentary on how this highly expensive serum mixture tasted.That being said, the value of medicine lay not in its taste but in its effectiveness. After downing the serum mixture, Roel closed his eyes to focus on the miraculous changes that were happening to his body\u2026\u2026 or he would have been if not for the fact that nothing was happening at all.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? I thought I was supposed to have a huge burst of power and go Super Saiyan! System, is this how the serum mixture is supposed to work? I paid 1000 gold coins for it, and nothing is\u2026 Gahh!\u201dHalfway through delivering his indignant consumer complaint, Roel\u2019s body suddenly shuddered as he felt a burning heat rising from his stomach, spreading all over his body within seconds.He could sense his temperature rising at a rapid pace, such that his head was starting to feel groggy from overheating. He immediately rose to his feet and struggled to make his way over to his bed, only to find himself blacking out after barely taking a step.Bam!The chair was knocked to the ground, falling right beside a collapsed black-haired boy.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014While Roel was knocked unconscious under the effects of the serum mixture, far away in Rosa, the little Soul-calming Lamp that he had sold to the Sorofya Merchant Association was gradually creating ripples that would eventually change his fate.\u201cIt\u2019s working! It really is working!\u201dA ginger-haired middle-aged man dressed in opulent robes sat upon the main seat in a dark room while exclaiming in agitation.There was a shabby-looking oil lamp placed on the table in front of him, emanating a bizarre white light. It illuminated the magnificent paintings and invaluable old books spread around the room, as well as the plants that were specially imported from Gran Fiefdom that were placed along the sides\u2026\u2026 and not to forget, the excited faces of those gathered around the centrally positioned table too.\u201cMister Bruce, how are you feeling at the moment?\u201d\u201cI feel great. The corrosion is slowing down\u2026 No, it has pretty much come to a halt.\u201dHe touched his own chest as he tried to perceive the changes that were going on in his body, and soon, he nodded his head affirmatively once more.\u201cThe unease in my soul has vanished, and I can feel that the effects of the undead reanimation gradually undoing itself. What\u2019s amazing is that it actually has no side effects on me at all\u2026 Andrew, are you able to identify what this lamp is?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ve never heard of this item before. However, I\u2019m certain that it\u2019s an antique originating from before the Third Epoch.\u201dA spectacled old man wearing a pointed hat, Andrew, remarked as he stepped forward to examine the Soul-calming Lamp close up.\u201cThis oil lamp appears to be made of a special kind of dirt, and the oil within seems to be the blood of some creature. My guess is that it\u2019s the product of an heretical cult. Judging by the lack of adverse side effects, it doesn\u2019t seem to be from an evil cult. It\u2019s probably from one of the cults in the Second Epoch that has already been forgotten by civilization,\u201d replied Andrew.\u201cIs it possible to replicate it?\u201d\u201cI can give it a try, but the chances of success are slim.\u201d\u201cIf you aren\u2019t able to do it, no one else will be able to either. What an irony. I never thought that a day would come when I\u2019m dependent on a lamp to live,\u201d remarked Bruce Sorofya wryly.No one else in the room could bring themselves to laugh at his remark. A heavy silence lingered in the air until a man holding onto a black wooden staff finally spoke up.\u201cGiven the rate the oil is depleting, the oil lamp should be able to last us several years, which means that we have more time on our hands to devise a countermeasure.\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. With this additional time bought and our influence as Sorofyas, it\u2019s not entirely impossible for us to find a remedy.\u201dThe group inside the room tried to maintain an optimistic attitude.Bruce Sorofya smiled bitterly to himself. It was at least a good thing that he managed to obtain this lamp, so he shouldn\u2019t get too pessimistic about the current situation, he thought.\u201cWith these additional years bought, I\u2019ll be able to raise Charlotte up. By then, I\u2019d be able to leave with no regrets. If that doesn\u2019t work out, we\u2019ll have no choice but to put our lives on the line.\u201dBruce\u2019s words brought grave looks to everyone inside the room. The crowd nodded as one, resolutely, as if affirming their determination.It was then that someone suddenly thought of something and asked.\u201cWho is the seller of this oil lamp? Do we have the person\u2019s information?\u201d\u201cIt was sold by the Ascart House of Saint Mesit Theocracy.\u201d\u201cWhat? The Ascart House?\u201dUpon hearing the words from his subordinate, a frown immediately formed on Bruce\u2019s forehead and he lowered his head in thought.This reaction made the rest of the group gathered around the table look at one another quizzically before Andrew finally propped up his glasses and inquired.\u201cBruce, are you acquainted with the patriarch of the Ascart House?\u201d\u201cN-no, I don\u2019t know him. It\u2019s just that\u2026 we have some history together. Did the seller leave behind any words?\u201d\u201cNo. On the contrary, he instructed the manager of the branch not to reveal any information about himself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHearing those words, Bruce visibly relaxed a little, thinking that it might have been all a coincidence.Indeed. It has been nearly a hundred years since then, so who would still remember the promise from back then?Bruce chuckled to himself, thinking that it was all over. Yet, who could have thought that there would still be a continuation to the story?\u201cWhat\u2019s weird though is that the seller is the son of Marquess Ascart, and he\u2019s only nine this year.\u201d\u201c9-year-old? He\u2019s of the same age as our young miss. Could it be that he secretly sold the treasure behind his family\u2019s back?\u201d\u201cHaha, how is that possible? This is an antique from the Second Epoch! It can easily be regarded as a family heirloom in any noble lineage!\u201d\u201cAccording to the report, it appears that Marquess Ascart instructed his son, Roel Ascart, to handle the transaction. Based on the information we have gathered, this young successor doesn\u2019t possess any transcendental abilities, so this might be an attempt to get on good terms with the local branch. That could help them in building up a partnership with us in furthering the development of the fiefdom\u2019s commerce.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s possible. If the young successor is unable to become a transcendent, he\u2019ll have no choice but to focus his efforts on managing the fiefdom.\u201dWhile the crowd was discussing the affairs of the Ascart House, Bruce Sorofya fell silent once more.The others didn\u2019t think much of Marquess Ascart\u2019s decision of entrusting the job of selling the Soul-calming Lamp to his son, but Bruce felt that there was something more to it.He felt that it was a reminder coming from the Ascart House, a reminder that they still remembered the promise. The Ascart House was urging him to fulfill his end of the promise, and in order to do so, they even went to the extent of offering him their family heirloom, so as to keep him alive.Bruce had no idea how the Ascart House knew about his current condition, and he had no idea how the news of him being the buyer leaked out either. A hundred years passed in a flash, but the veil of mystery surrounding the Ascart House only thickened.\u201cCould this be fate?\u201d he muttered weakly.After another long moment of reflection, he couldn\u2019t help but utter his daughter\u2019s name in a daze.\u201cCharlotte\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This alternating freeze-fry treatment continued for two torturous days, inflicting such great suffering that Roel\u2019s consciousness had started fading near the end.It was only much later, when a girl\u2019s unbearable weeping gradually grew louder and louder in his ears, finally penetrating his stupor, that Roel regained consciousness. He slowly opened his heavy eyelids and saw an ornately designed ceiling above him.\u201cThis place is\u2026\u201d\u201cBig brother Roel! You\u2019re finally awake! Wuuuu\u2014\u201d\u201cAli\u2026 cia?\u201dThe young man struggled to turn his head, only to have a silver-haired girl pulling him in. Before he knew it, he was already in the embrace of a bawling Alicia. No matter how he tried to console her, she simply wouldn\u2019t stop crying.Meanwhile, Anna began shouting loudly upon noticing that Roel had awoken.\u201cYoung master is awake!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful! I\u2019ll inform the old master right now!\u201dThe servants quickly relayed the news, and before long, anxious footsteps rapidly approached outside before a figure came bursting through the door. It was Carter.Roel was astonished to see his father acting in such an undignified manner for the very first time. However, Carter paid it no heed as he began examining Roel from head to toe worriedly.\u201cRoel, you\u2019re finally awake. Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m feeling fine, just a little tired.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good.\u201dCarter heaved a deep sigh as he nodded in relief.While comforting the crying Alicia, Roel asked his father what was going on, only to be shocked to learn that he had actually slept for three whole days!Or to be more accurate, he had been ill for three days now.It was on that night three days ago that Anna first noticed Roel lying unconscious beside a chair. Roel was in a delirious state then, and his body was burning up. The flustered Anna immediately ran off to inform Carter of the matter.Carter was in the midst of trying out his new clothes when he heard from the panicky Anna. Clothes were immediately tossed aside as he dashed straight over. Immediately, Carter moved his son over to the bed before instructing the servants to lower his temperature so as to prevent his body from overheating.It was around this time that someone noticed the serum containers and glass cup used to mix the serums together on Roel\u2019s table.Carter inspected the remaining liquid droplets inside the serum containers and noticed that they contained magic power inside them. The first thought that came to his mind was that someone had attempted to assassinate his son, so he immediately locked down the mansion and began casting spells to trace the culprit.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to investigate the matter. I drank the serums of my own accord!\u201dNoticing that the matter was beginning to blow out of proportion, Roel quickly spoke up and intervened. He told Carter that he found some medicine inside the vault labeled to be \u2018body enhancing\u2019. Out of a moment of recklessness to improve his constitution, he ended up drinking it.The realization that no one was out for Roel\u2019s life made everyone in the room heave a sigh of relief, but Roel still had to go through a long lecture from Carter for his reckless behavior.\u201cHow can you just consume the items inside the vault so recklessly? Do you even know how long the serums have been there for? It could have already expired by now! You should be glad that you\u2019re still alive right now after drinking such stuff!\u201d\u201cI was wrong, father. I won\u2019t do it again\u2026\u201dRoel didn\u2019t expect the two serums described to be a \u2018perfect fit\u2019 to turn out like that too, so he apologized earnestly.Seeing how remorseful Roel was, Carter decided to let this matter go. He reminded Roel once more to never act so recklessly again before finally leaving the room.After finally resolving Carter\u2019s side, Roel turned his attention to comforting the still weeping Alicia.\u201cBig brother Roel, I understand how you feel, but you mustn\u2019t do this ever again! If our house ever needs the power of a transcendent, even if what I am able to do might amount to very little, you should at least rely on me a little!\u201dAlicia spoke with a tearstained face. However, those words from Alicia made Roel\u2019s body stiffen a little.No no no, you\u2019re looking down on yourself way too much. If that power of yours is considered as weak, there would be nothing in this world that can be considered strong anymore!Putting his mental retorts aside, Roel promised Alicia that he wouldn\u2019t do anything reckless in the future anymore, and the little silver-haired girl finally managed to crack a faint smile. The two of them continued hugging for a while longer before finally separating.The unintended illness had caused a huge panic in the Ascart House, but to be honest, Roel had a hard time being too upset by how things turned out. This incident showed him that the effort he had been putting in over the last month hadn\u2019t been in vain.There wasn\u2019t anything different about Carter, since he was known to be a doting father anyway, but Alicia\u2019s attitude was truly different from how it was in the game\u2019s storyline. Had it been the original Roel, Alicia would have politely enquired about his condition while feeling nothing inside\u2026 At the very least, she wouldn\u2019t have soaked his clothes in tears.While he felt bad for worrying them, knowing that someone cared so much for him made him feel warm on the inside.\u201cYoung master, you have just recovered from your illness. You should change your clothes.\u201d\u201cVery well.\u201dRoel patted his chest as he took off his soaked clothes and passed them over to Anna.These servants of the Ascart House were also treating him differently from before as well. Had it been in the past, they might have been fidgeting around out of worry that they would lose their jobs, but they definitely wouldn\u2019t have been so concerned about him.Kindness does reap kindness. At least the Ascart House isn\u2019t as unfeeling as it used to be.As Roel\u2019s thoughts wandered, he began to take a closer inspection of his body. He soon noticed another change of a very different sort.He didn\u2019t feel as weak as a patient who had just suffered three days of high fever should. Closing his eyes and clenching his fists tightly, he could clearly sense that his body was much stronger than before.Considering how much he had forked out for the serum, he expected at least this much. The knowledge that he hadn\u2019t spent his money in vain filled him with relief.Such thoughts in mind, Roel opened the System\u2019s User Interface, and there was indeed a difference in his status.\u3010Name: Roel AscartGender: MaleAge: 9Bloodline: IronEpithet: \u2013Tier: F+ (Magician Apprentice)Fundamental Spells: Minor Heatwave, Phantom Hands\u3011Just by drinking two bottles of serum, his tier had already increased from F- to F+. The (Defective) tag that was previously on his Phantom Hands had disappeared too.On top of that, he could sense that he hadn\u2019t fully assimilated the energy inside the serums. As long as he trained hard, he should be able to raise his tier up to E soon. That would correspond to Origin Level 6, the strength of a trained militia soldier.It might just be a single tier, but it made a huge difference.The strength of a trained militia member was far greater than that of an ordinary civilian. They possessed the strength to curb even lions and tigers with ease, though mana-mutated demon beasts might still pose a bit of trouble.During peacetime, militia soldiers were tasked with the responsibility of ensuring security and order on the streets, but as soon as a crisis struck, they would come under the military. With their greater numbers, they would form the bulk of the army, standing steadfast to repel aggressors.\u201cI guess I\u2019ve finally managed to take a small step forward?\u201d1 reply\u00a0\u2013 1 hour agoHe was feeling a little agitated by how his efforts were paying off. He might not be a natural-born talent like Alicia and Nora, but he was still advancing at his own pace. A step at a time, he would accrue power and eventually change the tragic fate that was awaiting him!\u201cI shall grow stronger, pluck out all my death flags, and live a peaceful life!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 - Oomph!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33: Oomph!Roel was currently standing on the Ascart House\u2019s training field, swinging his sword down on wooden targets. A 9-year-old child wielding an edgeless metal practice sword against a resilient wooden target would have usually been a monotonous cycle of repeating the same movements again and again.But something was different today.Bam! Bam! Crack!Swinging with all his might, Roel split open the wooden target in just three strikes. Even the practice sword had dented slightly under the sheer force of the blows. This was absolutely a show of superhuman strength.It was impossible for an ordinary human to smash one of these wooden targets in just three strikes, especially when bludgeoning it with an edgeless blade.\u201cSo this is Origin Level 6, the System\u2019s tier E?\u201dRoel retracted his blade, feeling gratified. His body had undergone a massive change over the last few days, especially the mana in his body.A week ago, Roel spent a great deal of money to purchase two serums from the System, only to be incapacitated for three whole days after consuming them. After he regained consciousness, Carter strictly instructed Roel to continue resting in bed, so as to ensure that his body recuperated properly. He even went to the extent of ordering Anna to keep a close eye on him.Under Anna\u2019s watchful gaze, Roel could only flop around in bed out of boredom for another three days before he was finally liberated. As such, this was the first time he was testing out his newfound strength.During his three days of enforced rest, Roel felt the serums\u2019 energy gradually being assimilated into his body, causing him to become more and more energetic with each passing day. Sometimes, he even found himself unable to sleep at night. His five senses grew much sharper, and his reflexes were faster than ever.It was only this morning that Roel had a look at his User Interface and realized that his tier had risen to E. That was why he immediately rushed to the training field to try his hand.His newfound strength was truly amazing. He felt that he could slice an unarmored enemy in half without much issue. Even if he had to face a mountain tiger right now, he didn\u2019t think that he would necessarily lose.While Roel was satisfied with his growth, he didn\u2019t let complacency get to his head. The enhancement serum could only bring his constitution and talent as far as tier E. There was still a long way to go if he wanted to further raise his Degree of Assimilation to Origin Level 5.\u201cEyy, I\u2019ll probably have to find another way to raise money soon.\u201dRoel had two boxes of gold coins stowed away securely in his little personal vault, but his gut feeling told him that it would be far from sufficient. For the first time ever since his transmigration, he felt that he was really poor.Even after pumping so much money in, it would still be hard for him to catch up to the footsteps of true prodigies like Alicia and Nora. As the game\u2019s capture targets, they were blessed with superior bloodlines that allowed them to achieve far more than ordinary people could despite exerting just half the effort. The only solace for him was that such elites numbered in the minority in this world.Even though Alicia usually appeared docile in Roel\u2019s presence, the reality was that she was far stronger than the previous F- Roel. Even with two years of disparity in their ages, her proficiency in spells was far above Roel\u2019s.That being said, the two of them had their own strengths and weaknesses. Alicia was known for her regenerative ability, but her offensive prowess was lacking by comparison. It was the opposite for Roel, where he had great strength but ordinary recovery.In any case, after testing out his physical prowess on the wooden targets, Roel proceeded to the next segment\u2014spell practice.He picked up a spellbook, which he hadn\u2019t touched for a very long time, and began looking through the spells inside.It was common knowledge that all of the basic spells, prior to obtaining an Origin Attribute, were transitory spells. At Origin Level 7, the spells that one could learn were mostly functional spells that had little offensive power, such as Phantom Hands and Minor Heatwave. In his former world in a certain popular game, these could barely even count as level 0 spells. They were only good for minor chores like retrieving objects or drying one\u2019s clothes.Origin Level 6 was viewed as the minimum requirement to learn spells that were actually useful for offensive purposes. Those at this level would find their bodies undergoing a set of changes that brought about a significant enhancement in their control over mana, thus opening up a vast new array of spells that could be learned.A veteran militia soldier would usually have quite a few decent spells up his sleeves, and what Roel wanted to learn was something practical that would be of help to him.After an hour of nitpicking, Roel finally narrowed down the list of spells he wanted to learn.\u3010Focused BurstChannels one\u2019s mana within the body toward a chosen body part to strengthen its speed and resilience. Can be used for both offense and defense.\u3011\u3010Spell GlovesImbues magic power onto one\u2019s hands to fend against enemy attacks. Resilience of the gloves is dependent on the attribute of the imbued mana instead of the amount of mana used.\u3011\u3010Controlled BreathingA distinctive breathing method that requires the use of mana. It can significantly reduce the depletion of one\u2019s stamina, allowing one to stand strong in a prolonged battle.\u3011The three spells were all Origin Level 6 support type spells that Roel found in the spellbook.Why support type? The preferred way of fighting at this level was still close-quarter combat; spells more or less played an auxiliary role. The reason for that was not too hard to figure out\u2014the offensive type spells at this level were simply too ineffective. Take this for example\u2026\u3010FlamethrowerCreates magical spell flames. The amount of damage it can inflict in the short-run is limited, but it is useful as a feint.\u3011\u201c\u2026\u201dThis was basically the kind of offensive type spell that one could learn at Origin Level 6. Roel didn\u2019t think something like that was useful in the long-run, unless you wanted it for roasting meat. Unless he were to get stuck at Origin Level 6 for too long, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t bother wasting time learning such showy yet useless stuff.Shortly after Roel recovered, Carter traveled back to the Holy Knight Order. He had piled up quite a bit of work in the days he stayed at the Ascart House looking after Roel, so it didn\u2019t seem likely that he would be able to return anytime soon.As a result, Roel and Alicia returned to their comfortable twosome life. The days that followed were quite peaceful.Roel, having gainedrealtranscendental abilities for the first time in his two lives, could now hardly curb his excitement at all. He put his all into learning everything there was to know about spells. At the same time, he also upped the intensity of his physical training severalfold too, resulting in a massive improvement in his swordsmanship.With this, he finally graduated from being a weakling.Alicia had been working hard during this period of time too. It appeared that Roel\u2019s illness had sparked something within her.She was able to integrate into the Ascart House successfully due to Roel and Carter\u2019s efforts, and she began developing a sense of responsibility toward the house too. She felt that she needed to contribute back to her adoptive family, especially after she learned that it was nigh impossible for her Lord Brother to gain transcendental abilities.Well, it went without saying that she was unaware that her brother was a pay-to-win player who dumped his fortune into the cash shop to squeeze out some transcendental abilities from his tiny body.After the autumn harvest came to an end, Roel was relieved of his responsibilities as a tax official. There was currently nothing in the Affection Points Shop that caught his interest, so he decided to put that aside for now and focus on developing his individual ability.That being said, the three-times-a-day Affection Points farming sessions with Alicia still continued, and he was always able to harvest quite a substantial amount each time. Furthermore, he noticed that the amount of Affection Points he was getting out of the servants was increasing as well.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAnna had been quite happy during this period of time too. Being able to watch over the sweet, budding romance between the young master and the young miss, together with her colleagues, had become her daily dose of bliss. The adorable interactions between the two of them would always leave her squealing excitedly in her mind without fail.Such peaceful days passed in a flash.Before one could notice, autumn had already come to an end, and winter was on the verge of setting in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 - Is This Bribery?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 34: Is This Bribery?Winter seemed to have snuck up on them while Roel and Alicia were preoccupied with their studies and training. The temperature continued to fall, and eventually, it started snowing.Gazing upon the scene outside, which had been cloaked in a layer of white snow, Roel couldn\u2019t help but feel a little excited inside. It felt almost as if the world was inviting him out to take a look and have a snowball fight. Even Alicia, who was usually calm and quiet, felt an urge to frolic about in this weather.It was a pity that Roel and Alicia were the only ones in the Ascart House, and Roel couldn\u2019t bear to really go all out against her in a snowball fight. In the end, they simply made a snowman together.There was a superstition that a snowy winter would lead to a bountiful spring, so the farmers living in the suburbs also rejoiced at the weather.Snow continued to fall for several consecutive days before the weather calmed down. It was on the day right after it stopped snowing that Carter finally returned back to the Ascart House. He appeared to have plenty of work on hand, such that he didn\u2019t have time to rest at home. Even on his rare, free days, he led the militia and military soldiers out to the mountain to hold the local Winter Hunt.The Winter Hunt was a staple event for each fiefdom. The onset of winter signified the withering of plants and crops, resulting in a lack of food and other necessities. At times like this, the local noblemen would rally the men in their territory, who were free at home, to hunt down animals in the wilderness.The meat of the hunted animals could be eaten as food, and their skin could be stitched together as coats. It was one of the ways to alleviate the difficulties brought about by the harsh conditions of winter.The nature of the Winter Hunt changed over the years though, as the populace learned how to prepare for and cope with the harshness of winter. Furthermore, safety net measures were put in place to help the needy. Starvation was no longer a huge problem for the commoners anymore.As such, the Winter Hunt turned into something more like a festive celebration instead.Roel was still too young, and he didn\u2019t want to leave Alicia alone at home either, so he opted not to participate.Carter spent three whole days up in the mountain before finally returning with a deer head in hand.\u201cWhat is\u2026 this?\u201dIt was inevitable that Roel was startled to see the massive antlered deer head that was almost the size of a table.If the rest of the body matches this head\u2026 that would mean this \u2018deer\u2019 is around the size of an elephant!And as if its humongous size wasn\u2019t enough, it had quite a terrifying appearance too.Three rows of razor-sharp teeth in its mouth was absolutely not something one would expect to see from an herbivore. Its antlers had a color gradient that was ashen-black at the bottom but blood-red at the tip, and they radiated an eerie crimson glow in the dark. Even though the deer was already dead, Roel could still feel an oppressive vibe coming from it.\u201cThis is a Bloodhorn Deer that has mutated under the effects of mana, turning it into a ravenous beast that feeds on meat. It\u2019s quite rare to see one that has grown so large. I\u2019m proud to say it\u2019s our greatest spoil from the Winter Hunt. It\u2019s fortunate that I was the one who encountered it, or else it could have caused devastating damage to those living in the region.\u201dThe way in which Carter was stroking the massive head of the deer with a relieved look left Roel feeling a little speechless. His evaluation of Carter\u2019s strength as a Chief Magician was swiftly being refreshed.\u201cFather, how powerful was this deer?\u201d\u201cBloodhorn Deers are usually at Origin Level 4, but this one is bigger than normal, and the spells it cast from its antlers were unusually powerful too. I\u2019d say that it\u2019s quite close to Origin Level 3.\u201d\u201cIs that so? I understand,\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euRoel spoke, as he took a deep look at Carter.Though his father had never mentioned how strong he was before, from this incident, and even if Carter had the assistance of the soldiers in encircling the Bloodhorn Deer, it was likely that he was at least Origin Level 3 to subdue this deer.Roel\u2019s gaze slowly moved back to the massive deer head on the ground. Even its antlers were as thick as his thighs. This made him cognizant of the fact that this world might not be as safe as he had assumed it to be\u2026A few days after the Winter Hunt, Carter departed the Ascart House again, due to work coming up once more. Roel and Alicia were already used to it by this point, so they didn\u2019t kick up a fuss.Life went on as usual until an unexpected visit from a familiar face brought a pleasant surprise to Roel.Arwen, the manager of the Sorofya Merchant Association\u2019s Ascart City Branch, had personally dropped by the Ascart House to deliver a short sword.Roel hadn\u2019t been in contact with Arwen ever since their transaction three months ago. It was an intentional decision on Roel\u2019s part, since he wasn\u2019t planning on selling anything else from the System to the Sorofyas.Three months had passed just like that. The short sword Roel had ordered from the Sorofyas back then was ready, so Arwen came by personally to deliver it.It was not as if Roel was on bad terms with Arwen, so it would be rude of him to chase the latter off for no reason. So, he invited Arwen in for a cup of tea in their guest room.One thing that Roel didn\u2019t expect was for Arwen to have a beaming smile on his face. It was an earnest smile filled with happiness and gratitude, not the usual business smile that he put on when dealing with customers.\u201cYoung master Roel, you have really done me a great service!\u201dArwen grabbed Roel\u2019s hands in agitation as Affection Points popped out furiously above his head. This situation left Roel rather flabbergasted; he had no idea why Arwen was acting in such a manner.Noticing Roel\u2019s bewilderment, Arwen quickly calmed himself down and explained the situation.\u201cThe buyer of the oil lamp told me to relay their sincere gratitude to you, saying that the effects of the oil lamp have far exceeded their expectations. The Rosa Central Headquarters marked the matter as a huge contribution for me, and I\u2019ll be promoted to manager of the Holy Capital\u2019s Saint Mesit Theocracy Headquarters in the coming year. I\u2019m deeply grateful to Lord Marquess and you for taking care of me during my time here.\u201dRoel blinked his eyes in surprise upon hearing those words. He never thought that the oil lamp he sold would actually bring about Arwen\u2019s big promotion.One must know that that was a very important position within the merchant association!Wait a moment, it looks like the effects of my oil lamp are greater than I thought. It might result in unintended changes in the trajectory of the world. Is this a blessing or a disaster?Roel was familiar with the butterfly effect, where a single change could bring about far-reaching impacts in the future. He couldn\u2019t help but feel a little uneasy about the future deviating in an unpredictable manner as a result of his actions.However, after giving it some more thought, he felt that it was meaningless for him to brood too much over it. One should know that he was supposed to be a villain who would be lynched in a few short years! Could the future possibly get any worse than that?Besides, the buyer could possibly be from some unknown country far, far away\u2026\u201cHow could the sale of a single item possibly affect me so easily?\u201dRoel reassured himself as he tossed this matter to the back of his mind. Instead, he turned his attention to the two wooden boxes placed before him.One of the wooden boxes contained a short sword that was forged with top-quality glacial metal, which was known for its exorbitant price. The short sword had a razor-sharp edge that reflected a cold glint, and its short length made it convenient for a young noble to bring it around with her for self-protection. It came together with a blackwood sheath that was beautifully adorned with gold and jade.It was apparent that this short sword was worth quite a sum, possibly several tiers higher than what Roel ordered and paid for previously. Most likely, Arwen had \u2018upgraded\u2019 the order on his own accord.The content in the other wooden box was more straightforward. It was filled entirely with gold coins. With a quick glance, Roel could tell that there were at least several thousand of them inside.\u201cYoung master Roel, as a gesture of appreciation for your support thus far, I\u2019ve brought 5000 gold coins with me here today. I hope that you can accept it as a token of our friendship. I would like you to know that the doors of our Saint Mesit Theocracy Headquarters are always open to you!\u201dWith a radiant smile on his face, Arwen pushed the boxes toward Roel, urging the latter to accept his gifts.Roel smiled back in response to Arwen\u2019s gesture. He understood the rationale behind the latter\u2019s actions. Basically, Arwen wanted to be the exclusive intermediary handling all sales of the treasures that Roel had to offer.To be honest, Roel wasn\u2019t put off by Arwen\u2019s intention. While the latter was indeed a businessman out for profit, he was not a person who was blinded by greed.For one, Arwen could have concealed his promotion and saved himself 5000 gold coins, but he chose to be honest, trading short-term gains in favor of building a long-term working relationship. He knew where his priorities were, and he was able to act on them impartially.A person who knew how to give up on the small fish to reel in a big one was someone who knew how to do business.With such thoughts in mind, Roel stood up and offered his hand to Arwen.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll be troubling you in the future then.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 - JourneyingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 35: JourneyingA faint perfume coming from scented sachets suffused the interior of a spacious, moving carriage. By his side, a lightly snoozing small girl felt a little warm against him.It was such an environment that Roel opened his eyes groggily to look at the same, old ceiling he had seen for the last three days now.They were traveling in a horse carriage at the moment. It had been two months since the onset of winter.Roel, who rarely left the Ascart Fiefdom, was on his way to an annual social gathering of nobles that started just last year\u2014Her Highness Nora\u2019s birthday celebration.As the only successor to the Xeclyde House, Nora Xeclyde was extremely doted on by her grandfather, the incumbent Holy Eminence, John Xeclyde. For this reason, the social debut she had on her previous birthday was made extremely grand.The word \u2018debut\u2019 sounded just like an idol making their first media appearance, and it was a surprisingly apt description of the ritual. In this world, a noble\u2019s social debut referred to the first time he or she appeared in public, or put more simply, the first banquet that was attended.Children of nobility would undergo etiquette classes until their parents felt that they looked respectable enough to appear before the circle of their peerage. The parents would then find a suitable occasion to hold a banquet and invite guests over to introduce their child to them.The occasions most commonly used for social debuts were birthdays, since it doubled as a celebration at the same time. The Ascart House had also held a banquet for Roel\u2019s social debut earlier at the start of the year, and it was quite a grand event too.Contrary to popular belief, nobles rarely held celebrations without deeper agendas, since celebrations were rather costly to host. Nora Xeclyde had already made her social debut the previous year, so there was bound to be a different agenda for her birthday banquet this time around and for the following years too.Using the words of the Xeclydes, it was an occasion to unite everyone together and deepen relationships so that they could work together to lead the Theocracy toward a brighter future. In more conventional terms, it was to build connections and make friends.Even with the Xeclydes authority as the royal family, there were still many issues where they would need the support of the nobles, especially those from the Five Eminent Noble Houses. The Five Eminent Noble Houses carried a lot of clout due to their long-standing history, so even the royal family had to try to maintain friendly relations with them.As for the minor nobles\u2026 their role there was to pay respects to the royal family and know what the top brass of the country looked like, so as to avoid crossing them in the future.Roel was absent for this important banquet last year due to illness, so unless he were to be incapacitated, there was no way he would be able to escape from it. Not to mention, he was supposed to be a \u2018close friend\u2019 of Nora Xeclyde too.Close friend, my ass!Roel retorted coldly in his heart as he straightened his body upright and gazed out of the carriage\u2019s window. As the temperature continued to plummet, fewer people were getting out of their homes to move outside, especially in the suburbs.The road that they were traveling on had piled up high with quite a bit of snow, but fortunately, the Ascart\u2019s carriage was a top-quality magic tool. Putting aside its top tier ability to absorb shock, it was also able to travel at speeds comparable to riding on a normal steed, and it could steer through difficult terrain too. Nevertheless, even with the unobstructed traffic, it still took three days to travel from Ascart City to Holy Capital Loren.The group had rested in towns the previous nights, so their traveling speed was slowed considerably. The Ascart House had originally prepared two carriages for this journey, one for Roel and one for Alicia, but out of sheer boredom, Alicia eventually climbed into Roel\u2019s carriage to seek refuge.\u201cBig brother Roel, I\u2019m lonely.\u201d\u201cCome and join me in here then.\u201dSeeing how adorable the pouty-faced Alicia was, Roel immediately succumbed to her request. So, they continued their journey with a single carriage from that point on. Time seemed to pass faster when there was a companion. The two of them spent their time chatting and playing chess, and they would lie together with one another when they got tired. Despite that, three days cooped up inside a carriage still proved to be too stifling for Roel to bear.\u201cYoung master, we\u2019re going to arrive at our destination very soon. Please hold on for a little longer,\u201d said Anna, as she comforted the young man who was rolling his eyes at the scenery outside.Over the past two days, due to Alicia\u2019s arrival, Anna had been providing Roel with a great deal of Affection Points. Being able to admire this young couple at proximity had thrilled her, such that her knowing adult smile had been appearing with far greater frequency than before. Even three days of carriage ride couldn\u2019t dampen her spirits.\u201cHoly Capital Loren should be filled with nobles by now, right? Where are we going to stay?\u201d\u201cThe Ascart House has its own property in the Holy Capital. It was bought by your predecessors, and there are servants stationed there to maintain it.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dRoel was able to put his heart at ease after hearing Anna\u2019s words. The two of them continued to chat for another hour before the coachman informed them that the three-days journey had finally come to an end.Holy Capital Loren, as the base of operations and the face of the Xeclydes, was both grand and imposing. Its city walls towered at a height of 10 meters and were built by piling massive white boulders upon one another. Its immaculate white exterior made it look like a divine stronghold of mankind, and this image was further reinforced by the presence of fully armored soldiers patrolling the area.But well, looks were just looks.Despite how heavily fortified Holy Capital Loren was, it had never been sieged before, not even once. This was the holy land of the Genesis Goddess Church, and it held a special place in the hearts of Goddess Sia\u2019s worshippers. It was a testament to just how far the beliefs of the church had permeated the whole of humanity; no one had ever dared to raise their arms toward this place.And how strong could soldiers who had never faced war possibly be? Roel felt that there were so many precedents in the history of his previous world that the answer was rather clear-cut.As the carriage rumbled forward, the towering city walls gradually grew closer and closer. The extravagant exterior of the Ascart House\u2019s carriage swiftly caught the attention of the crowd lining up before the city gates.\u201cWhat a beautiful carriage! Where did this noble come from?\u201d\u201cMust be from a distinguished noble house.\u201dThe crowd discussed amongst themselves.On the other hand, the soldiers guarding the city gates knew just what to look out for.\u201cLook at that insignia!\u201d\u201cEye of a Candlelight, it\u2019s the Ascart House!\u201d\u201cThe Ascarts? Hurry up and open the side gates!\u201dThe guards on duty quickly informed their commander of the arrival of the Ascart House, and the commander immediately ordered for the opening of the side gates. At the same time, the crowd before the city gate also opened up a path and stood deferentially to the sides as they watched the carriage race by.Roel was able to catch a firsthand glimpse of the influence the Ascart House had in the Theocracy just by looking at the civilians outside from the windows of the carriage. These civilians held great respect toward the Ascart House, and it was even more so for the commander of the city gates. After amicably exchanging a few words with the coachman, the commander swiftly granted them passageway.\u201cHmm, it looks like our house is doing quite well in the military?\u201d\u201cThe Ascart House has great influence in the military. It has been twenty years since the old master joined.\u201dAnna\u2019s response to Roel\u2019s question made both him and the just awoken Alicia realize just how heavy their family name was.They would have to make sure to carry themselves well, so as to not embarrass the name of the Ascarts.Roel shot a glance at Alicia, and the two of them nodded their heads in unison.The carriage slowed down significantly after entering the city. The crowds along the streets grew denser the deeper they headed into the city, and discussions broke out when passers-by noticed the insignia of the Ascart House on the carriage. There were even a few who were explaining to their companions what the insignia represented.Soon, the carriage left the bustling market area behind to arrive at the more peaceful residential area for nobles which boasted an exuberance of beautiful scenery. Traveling past several magnificent mansions, they soon stopped before a classical villa.The Ascart House\u2019s Labyrinth Villa.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 - Rejecting the Queen is a Tradition of Our HousePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36: Rejecting the Queen is a Tradition of Our HouseThe Labyrinth Villa was quite a renowned place inside Holy Capital Loren. Rumors abounded amongst the populace that this property of the Ascart House was unbreachable.According to rumor, if the person entering was welcomed by the owner, everything would function normally within the villa. However, if the person wasn\u2019t welcomed by the owner, he would be faced with a labyrinth that he would never be able to escape from.This rumor had been around for so long that it was impossible to trace its origin anymore, but it did show the deference the populace held toward the Ascarts as a magician house that wielded mystifying powers.And Roel had the honor of living in this scenic location as one of its masters.\u201cFather, are the rumors true?\u201dWhile admiring the classical design of the villa that had come from over a hundred years back, Roel couldn\u2019t resist asking Carter about the authenticity of the rumors.That question made Carter chuckle to himself. He brought Roel and Alicia over to his study. After settling down on the chairs, he began sharing the history of their house.\u201cThis villa was built by the patriarch of the Ascart House three generations ago, who happens to also be my grandfather, Ponte Ascart. It currently has more than 170 years of history behind it.\u201dThrough Carter\u2019s explanation, Roel and Alicia learned about a history that was not only unknown to the general populace but was recorded only in the most confidential historical records.Around 200 years ago, the royal family of the Saint Mesit Theocracy, the Xeclydes had a pair of twins, a son and a daughter. The son was named Wade Xeclyde, whereas the daughter was named Victoria Xeclyde. This pair of siblings were highly talented, reaching Origin Level 4 at a very young age.This should have been good news to the Xeclydes, but in an unexpected twist of events, Princess Victoria discovered that her little brother, Prince Wade, was actually related to an evil cult.It was utterly scandalous for the successor of the Theocracy\u2019s Holy Eminence to be involved with an evil cult. Anyone else would have immediately raised an outrage upon learning of this matter. However, the sharp-witted Victoria didn\u2019t do so.She knew how sensitive her position as the second-in-line to the throne was, and acting without careful preparation could result in her being labeled as a rebel. So, after careful consideration, she decided to inform her spells teacher, Ponte Ascart, about the matter.After a series of verifications, Ponte eventually believed what Victoria said. The two of them began to gather evidence, as they awaited the return of the then incumbent Holy Eminence, who was far away at the Austine Empire. Then they could reveal Wade\u2019s true face.Little did they expect that the meticulous Wade would actually notice what Victoria and others were intending to do, and it resulted in a bloody internal conflict that was later dubbed as the March Turmoil.Back then, three of the Five Eminent Noble Houses were on Prince Wade\u2019s side and one declared neutrality, so as to steer clear of the conflict. Victoria only had the Ascart House and Ponte\u2019s army on her side, so the circumstances were very disadvantageous to her. With the central street of Holy Capital Loren as the boundary, both sides engaged in a bitter war that lasted over a month.Under the suppression of the armies of three eminent noble houses and the evil cult allied with Prince Wade, Victoria and Ponte\u2019s army was forced back time and time again. The situation then was so tragic that words could hardly describe them. Corpses were littered all over the Holy Capital, and even heavy rain couldn\u2019t wash away the stench of blood and corpses that had engulfed the city.Victoria and Ponte were inflicted with severe injuries in the midst of a battle, and the reinforcement that they had called for was stuck outside the city. Left with no choice, Ponte used a family heirloom to turn the area around his villa into a labyrinth, and the two of them sought refuge there.The enemy dispatched an army of nearly ten thousand soldiers to march into the Labyrinth Villa, but it was futile. Not only were they unable to find Ponte and Victoria, but many of them had even lost their lives in the labyrinth.This situation lasted for over two weeks, and it was these two weeks that changed the course of history of the Theocracy for good.Victoria\u2019s envoy had overcome all odds and successfully met up with the Holy Eminence who was still outside then. When the Holy Eminence heard that Wade had fallen into depravity and attempted to kill his older sister, his face warped in shock, and he immediately rushed back from the empire while rallying his armies. Eventually, he successfully made it back before the labyrinth was breached by the enemy.The Labyrinth Villa was the very place where Victoria and Ponte sought refuge. This villa still retained a fragment of the family heirloom used back then, which resulted in it having some mystical effects.\u201cAfter that? What happened next?\u201dThere was nothing more irritating than to have a story ending on a cliffhanger, so Roel quickly urged Carter to finish up the story. Alicia was also looking over with eyes twinkling in curiosity, hoping to hear the conclusion too.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSeeing this, Carter smiled calmly and continued.\u201cEverything that happened afterward is just normal history. Prince Wade was subdued and arrested by the returning Holy Eminence, and the evil cult was plucked out from its roots. The three eminent noble houses that sided with Prince Wade were punished for their actions. Ponte and Victoria managed to escape from the Labyrinth Villa safely. Victoria eventually became the next Holy Eminence, and the Ascart House was compensated handsomely for its deeds. It was from that generation onward that our Ascart House became a close ally of the Xeclydes.\u201dCarter\u2019s words made Roel and Alicia break out in relieved smiles. It was clich\u00e9, but it was always heartening to see justice triumphing over evil, especially when it was their predecessor that was portrayed in the story.\u201cAh. Speaking up to this point, I suddenly remembered a certain rumor about the story.\u201d\u201cA rumor?\u201dThe silver-haired girl asked curiously at Carter\u2019s remark.The mischievous Carter simply smiled quietly for a very long while, keeping the suspense, until Roel finally shot him a look of overflowing disdain.\u201cThe life-and-death situations that Victoria and Ponte had been through together back then resulted in them becoming close to one another. After that incident, Victoria proposed to Ponte, but\u2026 Ponte rejected her on the grounds of their age gap and their relationship as teacher and pupil.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t smell of anything good.\u201dAlicia\u2019s eyes drooped down. She was still at an age where she carried fantasies about love and romance, and it felt like a great tragedy that the love between Victoria and Ponte couldn\u2019t be fulfilled.Roel, on the other hand, was just very skeptical of this whole affair.Seeing this huge contrasting response he was getting from the two children, Carter shook his head wryly and further elaborated.\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. Ponte already had a family by then.\u201d2 replies\u00a0\u2013 1 hour ago\u201cAh, then it can\u2019t be helped.\u201dAlicia nodded her head in realization after hearing Carter\u2019s elaboration. This conclusion sounded much more acceptable to her.Meanwhile, Carter patted Roel\u2019s shoulder and said.\u201cI\u2019m telling you this so as to let you know that our predecessors have once rejected a member of the royal family, and it was that famous Victoria.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRoel looked at Carter, who was bizarrely puffing up his chest proudly, and he found himself speechless.Is that all?Father, you must have not known that I have already done it once myself, and I\u2019ll continue to do so in the future.While Roel was still retorting in his heart, he suddenly recalled something Carter had said, so he asked.\u201cWhat happened to our family heirloom then? You mentioned that there\u2019s a fragment remaining in this villa?\u201d\u201cThe family heirloom is a gemstone. It was already damaged before Ponte used it, and the multitude of enemies that charged into the labyrinth pushed the gemstone beyond its limit, causing it to be reduced to dust. Only a small fragment of it remains at the moment.\u201dA family heirloom that could ward off thousands of enemies was bound to be incredibly valuable, so Roel couldn\u2019t help but feel great pity about its loss. But thinking about it again, its sacrifice hadn\u2019t been in vain. It was the key to the continued prosperity of the Ascart House over the last few generations, an investment done right.\u201cAlright, that\u2019s all for my story. You had a long carriage ride to get here, so you should have a good rest.\u201dCarter clapped his hands as he instructed the two children to rest well. They had a long day ahead of themselves tomorrow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Factions formed as children tended to persist into adulthood, so houses that were close with one another usually requested for their successors to huddle together and form cliques.For this reason, this banquet was important to children like Roel too. He was already disadvantaged for being absent the previous year, and this was further worsened by the fact that the Ascarts didn\u2019t have many offspring or subordinate nobles.\u201cRoel, try your best to make friends at the banquet, but there\u2019s no need to force it if it doesn\u2019t work out.\u201dCarter told Roel prior to setting off to the royal palace.He was basically giving Roel some mental prep for what was to come. Carter himself didn\u2019t have a good time in his younger years, due to the Ascarts\u2019 reputation as a house of magicians, and it didn\u2019t help that Carter himself wasn\u2019t too interested in building factions and connections either. So, he thought that the banquet wouldn\u2019t be too pleasant for Roel either.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, father. I\u2019m not too bothered by all these.\u201d\u201cAlicia, it\u2019ll do for you to just follow your big brother Roel around later on.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I will.\u201dThe silver-haired girl replied obediently before slowly lowering her head. The smile on her face was slowly vanishing, replaced by unease.Hm? Is she feeling nervous? It\u2019s rare to see such a look on her face.\u201cAlicia, it\u2019ll be fine. Just follow me later on.\u201dRoel patted Alicia\u2019s head and consoled her.\u201c\u2026 I understand, Lord Brother.\u201dAlicia squeezed out a strained smile for Roel as she tried her best to push down the fear in her heart.It will be fine. I\u2019m a member of the Ascart House now, and big brother Roel is with me too\u2026\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013As the proverb went, \u2018clothes make the man\u2019.Given the grand occasion, the nobles of the Theocracy were dressed in their finest garments. However, one would be sorely mistaken to think that clothes was the only thing they could compare with one another. No, the nobles compared their carriages too.The usually peaceful street outside the Xeclydes\u2019 garden was already filled with all sorts of beautifully adorned carriages. These carriages formed a long queue as they awaited their entry into the royal palace.Carter made use of this opportunity to introduce their insignias for Roel and Alicia, paying greater emphasis toward the other four of the Five Eminent Noble Houses.\u201cThat grey bear insignia belongs to the Belfast Marquess House. Their fiefdom is located at the northernmost border of the Theocracy, a place known to be freezing cold. Their people are known to be incredibly tough.\u201cLook at the golden bird insignia on our left, that\u2019s the Lucerne Ducal House. They are the only ducal house left in the Theocracy and have always maintained a politically neutral stance.\u201cThe one in front of us with the tiger insignia is the Elric Count House. They used to be a marquess house, but they were demoted for supporting Prince Wade during the March Turmoil. As their fiefdom is located next to the border, they have always been known for their great military might.\u201cThe frontmost carriage belongs to the Weiss Marquess House. Their insignia is a campanula flower. Over the past few decades, they have been standing on the same front as the Xeclydes, making them a part of the royal faction. However, it doesn\u2019t seem like they are entirely steadfast in their stance.\u201dCarter introduced the major noble houses one after another, and Roel listened to him attentively. As such, the two of them didn\u2019t notice the darkened look on Alicia\u2019s face when the tiger insignia was mentioned.As the carriages entered the royal palace one after another, Roel finally managed to catch a glimpse of the breathtaking scenery of the royal garden. As it was the winter season, there wasn\u2019t the usual fountain and grass field, but even the gazebos were designed elaborately enough to carry the aesthetics of the garden. The green cedar trees that the gardeners had trimmed carefully were also exceptionally pleasing to the eye amidst the usual white landscape.Roel and the others got down from their carriage and walked into the manor with a brief display of their invitation cards. As for the gifts, they were entrusted to the maids of the royal palace to take care of.The interior of the manor was posh, filled with hanging crystal lights and artworks from famous painters. Roel stepped on the soft carpet as he examined his surroundings with a deepening frown. There was a bizarre sense of familiarity about this manor.\u201cDoes it look familiar to you? It has been a hundred years since this manor was built, that\u2019s why its design resembles that of our Labyrinth Villa.\u201dCarter revealed the answer to the mystery for the two children as he took a look around the manor himself too.Under the lead of the royal servants, they were brought to the banquet hall.There was still an hour or so till the banquet officially began, but there was a reason why the guests usually chose to arrive early\u2014it was to socialize with one another.Aside from members of the Five Eminent Noble Houses, there were also top military and governance officials around, lofty nobles from the capital and minor nobles from distant lands. All sorts of people were gathered in this banquet hall, making it an opportune moment to alleviate the slightly tense atmosphere in the air and learn more about current affairs.This was also a chance to observe the targets one wanted to get close to and make preparations for approaching the other party later on.Carter brought Alicia and Roel around to introduce them to the nobles and military officials he was closer to. After greeting quite a few people, Alicia and Roel successfully found a few younger companions that they could hang out together with for the birthday banquet.A daughter of a count house, a daughter of a viscount house, the daughter of a baron house\u2026 To put it in short, all of these younger companions were girls.What about the guys then? Weirdly enough, there was not a single one aside from Roel.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu???Am I born under a lone star?Roel\u2019s lips twitched at this unbelievable coincidence. He looked at the group of girls gathered around him with a headache, not knowing what he should say at all.Kids of his age tended to hang out with those from the same gender, which meant that Roel was very out of place in this group. They were still a few years away from the arrival of their youthful spring, where their hearts would start thumping for the opposite gender. As a result, while some of these girls were sneaking glances at Roel, none of them took the initiative to approach him.In any case, time passed by swiftly amidst this boisterous atmosphere\u2014at least for the others\u2014and soon, it was time for the birthday banquet to begin. The inner doors of the manor hall opened, and a massive group of servants stepped out from within to pave the way. Following that, the stars of the show finally made their appearance\u2014the Xeclyde royal family.Prince Kane was the one who escorted Nora into the banquet hall. She was garbed in a flowy dress that made her look like a fairy, winning her gasps of amazement from the crowd.Banquets in the Theocracy always started with a hymn. The bands began to play, and with Prince Kane taking the lead, the crowd sang their praise for the Goddess of Creation, Sia. After this formality was over, the banquet finally got to its main show.Prince Kane and the young Princess Nora first expressed their gratitude toward the nobles for their presence before formally declaring the commencement of the banquet. Plates of sumptuous dishes were served on a large buffet table, and servants walked around the room offering drinks to guests to quench their thirst.However, no one\u2019s attention was on the food and drinks. At this very moment, everyone was looking at the two members of the royal family standing at the forefront, searching for an opportunity to step forward and talk to them.\u201cI-I don\u2019t have to go, right?\u201dLooking at the graceful golden-haired girl standing in front, Roel took half a step back as he shot a glance at his father hopefully, only to be met with a deep smile from Carter.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 - Nora\u2019s Philosophy of HuntingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 38: Nora\u2019s Philosophy of HuntingWhat a boring event.These were the thoughts in Nora Xeclyde\u2019s mind when she looked at the pure and charming face reflected in the mirror.She had never been particularly interested in her birthday, and she didn\u2019t find it necessary to make a big fuss about it. In fact, she hated it when people did so. No matter what, this was still the day her mother left her.Her mother, who had no transcendent abilities, died due to labor difficulties.Nora might not have met her mother before, but she had a father who loved her deeply. Her birthdays initially had still been acceptable to her, but things began to change last year.From the moment of her social debut, her birthday became nothing more than a convenient excuse for the upper echelons of society to gather and socialize. This notion made her feel a little uncomfortable inside, and it made her even more so aware of how hypocritical and meaningless everything around her was.Do I have to face the fawning smiles of those nobles once more? Just looking at their faces makes me feel revulsion. All that is in their minds are ways to further their own interests, and they make it so blatantly obvious too. It\u2019s so unbelievably boring that I don\u2019t even want to bother dealing with them at all.These days are really getting unbearable\u2026 Oh, wait a moment. He\u2019ll be coming this year, right?The silhouette of a little boy flashed across Nora\u2019s mind, and emotions rippled on her impassive face. She remembered that he wasn\u2019t around during her birthday banquet last year. But since they had met one another this year, Marquess Carter would surely drag him here.\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be a little more interesting then?\u201dNora muttered under her breath as a rare tinge of anticipation touched her heart. Her lips subconsciously curled up into a smile.Everything proceeded smoothly afterward.Nora, who was rarely in public sight, awed the nobles easily with her appearance. Whether it be a guy or a girl, adult or child, everyone looked at her with eyes filled with amazement. None of this brought Nora any joy though. She faced the guests with a slight smile, all the while discreetly scanning the crowds to find that same-aged boy she remembered.There were too many people attending the banquet that it took Nora quite a bit of effort before she finally found her target. It was a black-haired boy standing behind his father with a helpless look on his face. The air of disinterest around him felt incongruous with the lively atmosphere of the banquet.Oho, that\u2019s quite an interesting expression he has over there.Nora\u2019s body trembled upon seeing the conflicted look on Roel\u2019s face, and she nearly burst into laughter even. She took a deep breath to maintain her poise before focusing her attention back on the hymn.After praying for Sia\u2019s blessings, going by convention, every noble house would bring their children forward to have a short conversation with Kane and Nora, so that the children could get to know one another. The time allocated was usually one to two minutes for each house, and anyone who took any longer than that would be scorned for a breach of etiquette.This was one of the things that Nora hated the most about her birthday banquet. One must know that this meet-and-greet session lasted a whole two hours last year. She had to maintain the highest level of decorum throughout this entire period of time and remember the name of every single person. As this was a standing buffet, she couldn\u2019t sit down and rest either.As the future leader of the country, Nora knew that it was her responsibility to display her most perfect self before her followers, so she hosted the nobles that stepped forth with utmost grace. That being said, she maintained a sliver of her attention on the black-haired boy, wanting to know what he was up to.The boy first argued with his father, Marquess Carter, about something, before his head drooped down in disappointment. A short while later, the two of them, together with a silver-haired girl, began making their way toward her.Nora keenly noticed the bitter look on the black-haired boy\u2019s face, and for the first time in this banquet, she revealed an entrancing smile that came from the bottom of her heart, causing the nearby guests to be spellbound.Is he trying to avoid meeting me? Hahaha, how interesting.Knowing that she was the culprit behind the boy\u2019s troubles, Little Miss Angel suddenly felt her mood lifting. The dreadful nature that she had sealed up deep within her threatened to burst forth. At the same time, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder why Roel was so averse to her.I agree that the girl named Alicia is rather adorable too, but I don\u2019t think that I\u2019d lose to anyone in a competition of outer appearances. Is it my personality then? Does my personality make you cower as if I am a venomous serpent hissing at you?Nora narrowed her eyes. It was not displeasure that she felt inside; it was excitement. The desire to dominate was puffing up in her chest, enticing her to succumb to her true nature.How I wish I could step on him right now.Nora tried her best to push down the thoughts running rampant in her head. While she liked seeing Roel\u2019s troubled expression, she didn\u2019t want to make him hate her. The dominance she sought wasn\u2019t one of imposed authority; she would only get a soulless shell of a body and not his heart. That was not what would bring her joy.There were many people who were more than willing to throw themselves at her for all sorts of reasons, but that was not what she wanted either. She viewed these people with revulsion, and they would never have been able to fulfill her desire to dominate either.This Little Miss Angel\u2019s criteria were quite specific, in fact. She wanted a person who was reluctant to be with her but had no choice but to accept her. She wanted a challenge!And a prey had just caught her line of sight.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euRoel Ascart knew the deep desires she harbored within, and he wouldn\u2019t intentionally please her. He was fearful of her, but it wasn\u2019t to the extent where he repulsed her. He had a dashing face and top-notch acting skills. He was a cunning person worthy of crossing blows with her.It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s a dessert prepared specially for me.Nora sighed yearningly as her face flushed slightly red.To obtain this man, render him utterly helpless before me, and make his everything mine; is there any greater excitement than this in the world?With such thoughts on her mind, Little Miss Angel put on a bewitching smile as she readied herself to cross blows with Roel.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\u201cIt has been a while, Your Highness.\u201dAt the forefront of the banquet hall, Roel, who had come forward reluctantly with Carter and Alicia, stood stiffly with his eyes focused on the ground. He spoke a stiff greeting that sounded almost as if he was reciting it monotonously from a book.Even Alicia couldn\u2019t help glancing at Roel in intrigue from his peculiar behavior.Nora was not surprised by the distant attitude that Roel was treating her with. She looked at Roel with a graceful smile and said.\u201cCall me Nora.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Pardon me?\u201d\u201cCall me Nora.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRoel finally raised his gaze, only to be faced with a beautiful angel with a smile so enchanting that it stopped one\u2019s breath. An ominous feeling arose in his heart.Beautiful indeed, but why do I feel like this lass is even more bad news than before?Roel felt as if he was a frog being eyed by a snake, and it made his heart jolt in fright. He forced himself to put on a smile as he responded to Nora\u2019s remark.\u201cYour Highness, you are\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Highness again? Does my name sound jarring to your ear?\u201dThe angel before Roel was still smiling, but her eyes had grown far more piercingly sharp than before. With the entire circle of nobility watching them, he had no choice but to relent.\u201cN-Nora?\u201dRoel decided to wimp out and go along with Nora\u2019s wishes, causing her smile to further deepen. Then, she said a few words that left everyone frozen in place.\u201cI\u2019m overjoyed to have you here. You are the only one that I was looking forward to meeting.\u201d(Affection Points +100!)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 - We\u2019re Really a Pair of Siblings Made in Heaven!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 39: We\u2019re Really a Pair of Siblings Made in Heaven!\u2018You are the only one that I was looking forward to meeting.\u2019The underlying meaning behind those words, in Roel\u2019s view, was similar to the joke \u2018Those who are supposed to be here aren\u2019t here\u2019.[\u00b9]The moment those words escaped Nora\u2019s mouth, all of the nobles in the vicinity fell deathly silent. They turned their heads over and stared at Roel with widened eyes, leaving him feeling as if countless daggers were stabbing into his back.\u201cAh, my apologies. It appears that I have misspoken out of excitement.\u201dNora covered her mouth with widened eyes, as if she had just noticed her own faux pas. She quickly corrected her words.\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that I was looking forward the most to meeting you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNora\u2019s following words raised another huge wave of commotion across the banquet hall. Hushed whisperings could be heard all around, and this time, even those who were at the furthest end of the banquet hall were starting to turn their eyes over too.In the blink of an eye, Roel had become the center of attention.W-what the hell is this woman talking about?!Roel stared at Nora in utter bewilderment, not knowing what kind of madness had struck her. The two of them had only met once before, so why was she talking as if they were lovers?Nora looked at Roel quietly with a smile after saying her piece. There was a gleam in her sapphire eyes, carrying an inconspicuous trace of mischief and excitement.Others might have overlooked it, but there was no way that could have escaped Roel\u2019s eyes.Son of a banshee! That woman is doing it on purpose!It was in that moment that Roel knew for sure that Nora carried bad intentions in her heart. He quickly racked his overclocked brain before answering with a composed tone.\u201cAh, is Your Highness hoping to have another game of chess with me? I understand. If time permits, I\u2019d be more than willing to accompany you.\u201dThose words made the crowd, who had been watching the thrilling drama unfurling before their eyes with bated breaths, deflate in a mixture of relief and disappointment.After all the buildup, it\u2019s just a game of chess? I thought that it was some explosive gossip\u2026Roel\u2019s explanation had popped the bubble of excitement for the onlookers. They slowly turned their attention back to their circles to resume their conversation.But what Roel didn\u2019t expect was that Nora had no intention of letting him go that easily.\u201cChess? Well, a game with you would interest me, but I don\u2019t recall ever playingthatwith you.\u201dNora looked innocently at Roel, her sapphire eyes shining.As expected, those words were incredibly effective in stirring up the interest of the crowd. Even Kane and Carter had turned to look at Roel in bewilderment.You demoness! What in the world are you trying to play over here?Are those words that can be spoken in public? Are you trying to confess to me right now?Roel, who desired to maintain a low profile and live his life out in peace, wanted nothing to do with this sadistic angel, but things were swiftly going down the wrong direction. Nora\u2019s words were as good as affirming their close relationship, leaving others with no choice but to view them as a pair.This disastrous turn of events left Roel feeling utterly anxious, but his mind was failing to find a good comeback to turn the situation around. Unexpectedly, at this crucial moment, a person stepped forward and saved him.\u201cYour Highness Nora, I enjoyed the pleasant conversation we had the previous time you visited the Ascart House. If I may humbly request, could you stop teasing my Lord Brother?\u201dAlicia stepped forward and curtsied gracefully to Nora. Her unique cool and lofty disposition felt like a refreshing spring in the midst of summer, winning her the compliments of the watching nobles.Alicia, well done!Roel was overjoyed by the arrival of reinforcements. He didn\u2019t think that the introverted Alicia would step in at a moment like this, and her tone sounded a little unhappy and pushy even. Could it be that\u2026She doesn\u2019t like Nora too?!No wonder! Or should I say, as expected of my little sister. It looks like we have the same taste in people! We\u2019re really a pair of siblings made in heaven!The sharp-witted Roel nodded approvingly to himself as he thought of just how amazing the bond between siblings was\u2026 unlike a certain man who was still watching the drama as if he was just an onlooker!While Roel was berating Carter on the inside, Nora and Alicia were shooting sparks at one another.The sapphire eyes of the golden-haired girl narrowed slightly as she met the crimson eyes of the silver-haired girl before her. Through a mysterious telepathy arising from the exchange of gazes, they were made aware of each other\u2019s intentions.This little lass actually likes her own stepbrother\u2026This woman is eyeing Lord Brother\u2026\u201cOh? I\u2019m not teasing your older brother though. These are my earnest thoughts.\u201d\u201cI see. It would appear that the months my Lord Brother and I have spent waiting for your letter hasn\u2019t been in vain. Allow me to thank you on behalf of my Lord Brother for your thoughtfulness.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNora\u2019s eyes gradually turned serious after hearing Alicia\u2019s words. She hadn\u2019t thought that this little girl who was two years younger than her would actually be so formidable with her words. While maintaining her poise and etiquette, this little girl naturally weaved an implicit message into her words to inform all listening ears that Nora hadn\u2019t been in contact with Roel ever since departing from theWith this piece of information, the crowd would have the impression that any words that Nora was going to say next were just an attempt to reconcile with Roel after giving him the cold shoulder for several months. Even Roel, who had realized that the tables had turned around, didn\u2019t look as troubled anymore.Looks like I can only go this far this time.Such thoughts in mind, the Little Miss Angel was forced to begin adopting an apologetic attitude.\u201cMy apologies, Alicia. I have been focused on my studies over the past few months that I couldn\u2019t divert my attention elsewhere. I am grateful to both you and Roel for attending my birthday banquet, and I hope that you\u2019ll have a pleasant time here.\u201dWith a smile, Nora politely concluded this high-level verbal war between experts.Carter and Kane spent the rest of the time chatting a little before their time came to an end, in which Carter then led Alicia and Roel back into the crowds.It was pretty much free and easy after greeting Kane and Nora.Typically speaking, the nobles who were still waiting for their turns to greet the royal family would gather together and converse while snacking on the food provided\u2026 though as nobles, they wouldn\u2019t eat too much in such a setting.For those who had already greeted the royal family, they would begin looking for the targets they wish to socialize with in order to carry out their agenda.As for the children, there were pretty much no restrictions at all. They could eat and drink whatever they wanted as long as they didn\u2019t look too indecorous. The parents would usually set them free to hang out with their little gang of friends.But Roel, as someone who was absent for the previous banquet, had a mission on hand. Carter would be bringing him around to introduce him to everyone that he ought to know of. In a sense, it was like a supplementary lesson for having skipped classes. Of course, Alicia had to come along too, since she was officially a member of the Ascart House as well now.Having to maintain a dignified posture and greet foreign faces one after another, Roel and Alicia swiftly tired themselves out. For an entire hour, they had to put on their most graceful smiles and behave in a way that would leave favorable impressions with others. Even so, they had only managed to greet the noble houses who were closer to the Ascart House by the end of the hour.\u201cLet\u2019s stop here. It\u2019s impossible to meet the nobles from all of the houses in just a single day. You must be starving by now.\u201dCarter also noticed that the two children were exhausted, so he urged Roel to bring Alicia over to the buffet table to grab something to eat while he continued to socialize with the other nobles.\u201cLet\u2019s get something to eat.\u201dRoel spoke as he looked at the table filled with glorious delicacies.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Footnotes[\u00b9] This is how the joke goes:A person was hosting a party. It was already beyond the time they had agreed on, but over half of the guests hadn\u2019t arrived yet. As a result, the host was feeling very anxious inside. So, he remarked.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t those who are supposed to be here, here?\u201dA few sensitive guests, after hearing those words, thought to themselves, \u2018You\u2019re saying that we aren\u2019t supposed to be here then?\u2019 So, they discreetly left the party.Seeing that some of the guests were leaving, the host grew even more anxious, and he exclaimed.\u201cWhy are the guests, who aren\u2019t supposed to be leaving, leaving?\u201dThe remaining guests heard those words and thought to themselves, \u2018You\u2019re saying that we are the ones who are supposed to be leaving then?\u2019 So, they left the party too.In the end, the only ones left at the party were the host and a few of his closer friends. One of the friends stepped forward and told him.\u201cYou should think before you speak. It\u2019s hard to take back your words once you have spoken.\u201dThe indignant host exclaimed in response.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking them to leave!\u201dThe remaining friends flew into a rage upon hearing those words and bellowed\u201cSo you\u2019re asking us to leave then!\u201dAfter saying those words, they turned around and left in a huff.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

While the purpose of the food was just to stave off hunger\u2014none of the nobles would actually feast on them\u2014every single dish that was present here were all hard-to-come-by delicacies!The Karon Forest\u2019s Blood-eyed Spotted Birds, known for their delectable flesh, were rumored to be the sentries of the werewolves. They were known to be both rare and hard to hunt, but they were being served on a huge platter at this banquet.The North Sea\u2019s Papershell Crab, dubbed the wonder of the sea, was an extravagant product that was little seen even amongst veteran fishermen. Its thin and crisp skin and its overflowing crab paste made diners salivate just at the sight of it.The fruits were rare exotic products, and the wine served was fine alcohol that had been aged for over twenty years.If the purpose of the banquet was to highlight the affluence of the royal family, they had done a darned good job of it.Roel wasn\u2019t sure how the culinary skills of the royal chefs were like, but just the ingredients were enough to whet his appetite. As a certified foodie from Earth, these dishes held a far greater attraction to him than whatever benefits he could derive from the other nobles.As important as socializing was, would it be able to stop the main character and his harem from killing him ten years later? If it couldn\u2019t, he might as well stuff himself with some good food so that he could die in peace.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith such thoughts in mind, Roel moved toward one of the plates and began to slice some meat to feed Alicia.Given that there were no servants around, he would have to take care of Alicia himself. That was also the reason why Carter told him to bring Alicia with him.However, the embarrassed Alicia ended up rejecting him.\u201cLord Brother, I-I\u2019m not hungry. I\u2019ll have some juice instead.\u201dAlicia wanted to accept Roel\u2019s goodwill, but having Roel feed her like a servant in public could potentially damage Roel\u2019s authority, and that was not something she could accept. Rather than seeing her beloved older brother becoming the butt of others\u2019 jokes, she would rather bear with the hunger a little.\u201cI\u2019ll get a cup for you then.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that, Lord Brother. You don\u2019t have to take care of me. I\u2019ll have a chat with those girls from earlier on instead.\u201d\u201cAh, alright then.\u201dRoel thought of the female nobles who were on close terms with the Ascart House and nodded his head. This was a rare opportunity for Alicia to make some friends. They usually pretty much stuck to one another year-round anyway, so there was no need for Alicia to follow him around on this rare occasion that they were outside.As such, Roel parted with Alicia and began embarking on his voyage of delicacies alone. Little did he know that a pair of vile eyes had already set its sight on the lonesome little girl.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Alicia traveled through the corridor alone.The onset of winter had caused the temperature to drop drastically. While it was still quite warm inside the banquet hall, due to huge crowds moving to and fro, it was freezing along the corridor. The music and laughter sounded hushed here. The lights along the walls were hung up high, making the corridor look a little dark.The tearoom that had seats provided for noblewomen to gather and chat with one another was located not too far away. Traveling through the dim corridor, Alicia suddenly felt her heart thumping in unease.She hated this place, and she hated this banquet too.It was not because the star of this show was Nora or that she carried some prejudice toward the Xeclydes. She hated this place because it carried memories that she didn\u2019t want to recall.She was terrorized by a group of boys right here, during the birthday banquet last year. Those children, in an attempt to please the successor of a count house, offered her up to him and pulled her over to an empty room to stab her with forks and knives. It was this incident that led to her phobia of sharp objects, rendering her unable to hold knives and forks anymore.Her father was furious after learning of the incident, but as there were no wounds on Alicia because of her regeneration ability, and there was no other evidence to incriminate the culprits, he had no choice but to let the matter go.Alicia didn\u2019t tell Roel and Carter about this incident, since it was already all over, and she didn\u2019t want to add to their troubles. She noticed the same boys who had terrorized her in the banquet this year too, but her identity was already no longer the same as before. She was no longer the child of a fallen baron house but the adopted daughter of the Ascart House, Alicia Ascart.Those cowardly bullies wouldn\u2019t dare to touch her anymore as anything they did to Alicia Ascart would be viewed as an insult to the Ascart House, and in fact, those boys did quickly avert their eyes back then in the main banquet hall.Is it finally all over?But barely after those thoughts surfaced in Alicia\u2019s mind, two boys suddenly stepped out from a bend at the corridor. They were the children from viscount houses, Luke and Shawn.\u201cStop right there! Alicia, it has been a long time since we last met.\u201d\u201cYou are\u2026\u201dThe two children stared at the shocked girl as obnoxious smiles reflexively surfaced on their lips. They had bullied her from a young age, so they knew just how weak-willed she was.Indeed, fear had already begun showing on Alicia\u2019s face.But things wouldn\u2019t go as they planned this time.While fear was slowly gripping Alicia\u2019s heart, a boy\u2019s silhouette surfaced within her mind. She recalled how Roel had accompanied and taken care of her the past few months, and it jolted her awake from her fear. She remembered the family name that she carried now, and she knew that she couldn\u2019t remain the weak girl she used to be.Previously, she could blame her low position and personal weakness for succumbing to those in power, but that excuse was no longer valid. She was the one in power now! If she still allowed others to climb over her head, she had only her own cowardice to blame.She knew that there was only one outcome if she didn\u2019t fight back, and that was the escalation of the oppression.For some reason, Nora\u2019s silhouette also flashed before her eyes at the moment. That golden-haired girl, despite her young age, was both confident and proud, to the point that it felt divine even. Had it not been for Roel, she would probably have carried great adoration for Nora too.But after having stood face-to-face with Nora earlier, there was only a thought in her mind right now\u2014I don\u2019t want to lose.She didn\u2019t want to lose to her rival. She didn\u2019t want to give her big brother away. For this, she had to change!\u201cShawn and Luke, it has been a long time. Is there anything you need?\u201dHaving reaffirmed her will, the silver-haired girl held back her fear and questioned the two boys before her imposingly, causing their smiles to freeze.The two of them looked at one another as they suddenly seemed to have recalled Alicia\u2019s current identity. Their complexions turned awful, and even their words didn\u2019t sound as smooth as before.\u201cY-you have to come with us!\u201d\u201cYes, you have to come with us!\u201d\u201cI refuse. My father and my brother are waiting for me, so I have no time to accompany you.\u201dAlicia placed great emphasis on the words \u2018father\u2019 and \u2018brother\u2019, causing Shawn and Luke\u2019s faces to further darken. They glared at Alicia angrily, but the realization of the difference in their standings made them dare not say or do anything.\u201cTsk, a bunch of useless fools!\u201dBut at this very moment, a third voice suddenly sounded from the darkness. A suave golden-haired boy stepped out from the bend of the corridor with over ten other children with him.From the moment he appeared, Alicia\u2019s face turned pale.The lips of the golden-haired boy curled up into a foul smile as he pointed at her and ordered.\u201cHold her down!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - I Am HerePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 41: I Am HereWhile Roel moved around the buffet table to fill his stomach, he thought about the stuff that Carter had told him about all this while.The birthday banquet last year was extremely important, not just because it was Nora\u2019s birthday but that it was the first time the young nobles of the current generation of the Theocracy were gathered together.There were many occasions for adult nobles to socialize with one another, be it the tea parties held by noblewomen or ordinary banquets. However, the chances for young nobles to meet one another were rare, and for some, this birthday banquet could even be the only opportunity.At this banquet, the socializing of the adults was surprisingly a secondary aim. The stars of the show were actually the children instead. It was a huge loss that Roel had missed the banquet last year as not only did he miss the chance to build up his own faction, he even ended up inadvertently giving an advantage to another house\u2014the Elric Count House.Of the Five Eminent Noble Houses, the only ones that had offspring of similar ages to Nora were the Ascart Marquess House and the Elric Count House. Since Roel was absent for the previous birthday banquet, the child that had the highest standing in the banquet other than Nora herself was the eldest son of the Elric House, Bron ElricSince Nora was busy greeting all the guests, Bron was granted free reign amongst the young nobles, allowing him to quickly build up a following. It should have been nothing much for a small child to gain some power, but it just so happened that Bron had quite a terrible reputation himself.Elric Youth Faction, that was what Carter called them. Bron and his following of degenerates might have been young, but the atrocities that they committed couldn\u2019t be easily shrugged off. They had stirred all sorts of trouble amongst the civilians, but most of them had been secretly dealt with so they hadn\u2019t caused a huge uproar thus far.In truth, Roel had been feeling an ominous vibe inside after hearing of the Elric House.A hundred years ago, when the Elric House was still a marquess house, their territory extended far and wide, making them the de facto leader of the Five Eminent Noble House. Even the Lucerna Ducal House was lacking in comparison to them. At its peak, the Elric House\u2019s power rivaled even that of the royal family.However, what turned the fate of the Elric House around was the fight between the royal twin siblings, the renowned March Turmoil.The Elric House had chosen to stand with Prince Wade in that conflict, and they served as the main fighting force of Wade\u2019s faction. Against Princess Victoria, who only had the backing of the Ascart House, it should have been a sure-win battle.Yet, all of it failed due to the interference of the Ascart House\u2019s patriarch back then. The labyrinth had simply consumed far too many of their soldiers such that they didn\u2019t even have the strength to stand against the returning Holy Eminence and his army.Prince Wade\u2019s defeat had far-reaching effects, and its mark was imprinted clearly in the history of the Theocracy. To the Elric House, it spelled a catastrophic disaster.As Prince Wade\u2019s fervent supporter, the patriarch of the Elric House back then killed himself in hopes that the Xeclydes would spare his house, but the results were still less than ideal. The Elrics were demoted to a count house, and a huge chunk of their territory was taken away too. They were only left with the barren borders to rule.Most of the territory they lost was given to the Ascart House, causing the power balance of the Five Eminent Noble Houses to be utterly reversed. It took a hundred years before the Elrics finally regained their power.Unfortunately, the Elrics didn\u2019t think that they had erred in their support of Prince Wade, and they didn\u2019t find anything wrong with the massacre that they had committed in the Holy Capital either. They felt that it was only natural for victors to trample on losers and rise through the ranks.It\u2019s all the fault of those damned Ascarts. Were it not for them, we might have even replaced the Xeclydes as the new royal family.The Elrics were respectful to the Xeclydes on the surface, but with a grudge sitting between them, they were constantly thinking of snatching back the territory they had lost and regaining the honor that had been trampled upon. Naturally, they viewed the Ascarts as their nemesis.\u201cWait a moment, father mentioned that the so-called Elric Youth Faction is here too. Children of this age tend to be fearless and act without concern of consequences. They should have come to provoke me, so why didn\u2019t I bump into any of them?\u201dRoel swept a look across the banquet hall, only to find that the golden-haired boy and the group of children he led had vanished without a trace. A frown formed on Roel\u2019s forehead as a foreboding premonition shook his heart.Wait a moment, could it possibly be\u2026\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Bron Elric was infuriated.Other than his usual gang, nearly all of the young nobles in this banquet had been trying their best to acquaint themselves with another person, and that was the other offspring of the Five Eminent Noble Houses here, Roel Ascart.Bron wasn\u2019t the type to look for faults in himself. He didn\u2019t think that the reason behind that was due to his horrid reputation. Rather, he blamed the Ascart House for resorting to despicable ploys.In any case, it was a fact that Roel\u2019s arrival had broken his dominance over the younger generation of nobles, and this made him feel deeply uneasy, but he had no idea what he could do about it.And it was at a time like this that he found the ideal target he could use to send out a stern warning to all other young nobles about siding with the Ascart House\u2014Alicia.\u201cDisgusting things tend to flock together with one another. Alicia Ascart, huh? Hahaha! What a revolting name!\u201dInside a spare room in the manor, a golden-haired boy, Bron, looked at the silver-haired girl in front of him with eyes filled with hostility.\u201cAlicia, do you remember me? I\u2019m your good friend, Bron. Did you really try to reject my invitation earlier? That really hurts my feelings.\u201dBron stared into the little girl\u2019s crimson eyes as he threateningly brought a knife closer to her eyes.Staring in the face of her fears, Alicia trembled uncontrollably as she cowered back. Tears glistened in her eyes. She bit her lips tightly as she tried her best to pull herself together.\u201cY-you\u2026 What are you trying to do here?\u201d\u201cI just wish to reminisce about our past together. I was planning on letting you off the hook easily this year, but I never thought that you would join the Ascart House. How convenient of you to find another father to fall back on so quickly. Ah, you also have that trash of a brother too\u2026\u201d\u201cI-I won\u2019t allow you to insult Lord Brother!\u201d\u201cOh, what\u2019s this? You seem to be pretty fond of him? It pleases me greatly to see the good relationship between you and your brother!\u201dBron sneered coldly as he leaned forward to Alicia\u2019s ear and whispered to her.\u201cDoes he know that you\u2019re a monster?\u201d\u201cW-what?\u201d\u201cHave you shown him how your body wriggles like there are worms inside when you heal from your injuries? Well, I guess your expression says it all. Of course, there\u2019s no way the Ascart House would have accepted you if they knew that you\u2019re a monster.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. Big brother Roel wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cHeh, you sure are stubborn!\u201dBron looked down on Alicia as he raised his leg to kick her, only for a silhouette to suddenly appear on the scene.\u201cAlicia, don\u2019t cry. I\u2019m here.\u201dAmidst Alicia\u2019s weeping, a voice suddenly sounded right behind Bron.Bron immediately turned his head around, only to find himself faced with a pair of wintry, golden eyes.Roel Ascart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - You Deserve to DiePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42: You Deserve to DieRoel would have never thought that there would be a death flag in this banquet too.Alicia\u2019s hatred toward the original Roel probably had its roots in this banquet too. The original Roel didn\u2019t have the guts or capability to stop Bron, so he would have only been able to watch in trepidation from the side.However, the current Roel was different.Words couldn\u2019t begin to describe how he was feeling at the moment. He only felt a heat burning in his body and mind. His mana was also burning.He finally understood why he had worked so hard all this while to reach Origin Level 6. If one were to think deeply into it, strength wasn\u2019t a necessity for him to avert the future storyline.But, standing behind Bron at this very moment, everything suddenly seemed to make sense to him. It was all so that he could beat this damned piece of shit into the ground!\u201cY-you, where did you\u2026 \u201dBam!Roel had no interest in wasting his time listening to what Bron had to say. He raised his hand to grab the golden-haired boy\u2019s face before abruptly smashing it into a nearby table.Boom!Roel\u2019s blood was pumping fast under the effects of mana, allowing him to exert superhuman strength. Bron\u2019s head was rammed into the table with great force, nearly imprinting his facial features into it. However, Roel wasn\u2019t happy with just this much.Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Kacha!Before anyone in the room could recover from their shock, Roel had already smashed Bron\u2019s head into the wooden table four times, and on the fifth time, the latter\u2019s head smashed right through. Only then did Roel finally stop a little.\u201cWhat a tenacious cockroach. You still aren\u2019t going to die yet?\u201dRoel gazed down coldly on Bron, who was frantically trying to pull his head out from the table. It was likely that the latter was at Origin Level 6 as well, or else he should have died from the very first blow.It was also at this point in time that the gang of young nobles behind him finally recovered from their daze.\u201cB-boss! Stop him!\u201d\u201cGet him!\u201dThese young nobles were all horrified to see how their leader was slammed into the table so easily, but there was no way they could back down here. There were all supposed to be Bron\u2019s closest confidants. They had to buck up their courage and step forward even if their opponent was the young master of the Ascart House.Eleven of them.Roel quickly ascertained the number of enemies he had to face. He quickly cast Controlled Breathing, so as to recover the stamina he had expended on smashing Bron\u2019s head, before flexing his unimpressive muscles toward the noble children. A fight was inevitable.\u201cBig brother Roel!\u201d\u201cAlicia, please wait a moment. I\u2019ll deal with these lackeys first.\u201dRoel first consoled the weeping Alicia before turning around to face his enemies.He might have already reached Origin Level 6, but it would still be difficult for him to face so many enemies at once. No matter what, these lackeys were still nobles, and some of them were decently talented too. There were five of them who were at Origin Level 6, just like him.How could he win this battle?In a face-to-face battle, victory would be impossible. However, a battle consisted of both brawn and wits.As long as his blows were vicious enough to instill fear in them, he could shatter their fighting will. Even if these young nobles possessed superhuman strength, their minds were still those of kids.With such thoughts in mind, Roel picked out the strongest one of the three lackeys coming at him and chose to attack him face-to-face.\u201cSpell Gloves!\u201dWith a furious roar, Roel imbued a layer of blue flames on his hands before his fist collided with the other party. With a loud cracking sound, the other party released a howl of agony.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAHHH\u2014!\u201dStriking a fist imbued with Spell Gloves was just like trying to strike a metal wall. The harder one struck, the greater the rebound would have been. In such a case, the other party\u2019s strength at Origin Level 6 bit back at him.The other party ended up having his bone fractured, causing him to roll around the ground from the excruciating pain.The other two lackeys who had charged forward with him froze in shock at the sight. Neither of them had reached Origin Level 6 yet, and seeing someone who was stronger than them getting done in so easily intimidated them.Of course, Roel wasn\u2019t going to miss this perfect opportunity to take down his enemies. He unhesitatingly flung his fist toward the two of them, sending them flying toward the wall.After defeating the first three, Roel quickly proceeded to deal with the rest. It was an utterly chaotic battle. Those who were still Origin Level 7 were of no use at all, and they were cleared out of the battlefield with a punch each. As for the other four Origin Level 6, they were engaged in a close fight with Roel.These Origin Level 6 noble children were indeed quite formidable. One of them had a massive physique that was as tough as stone. Even Roel\u2019s Spell Gloves couldn\u2019t breach his defense easily. Another one had a pair of searing hands that would melt Roel\u2019s skin if he were to ever get a grip on Roel. As for the remaining two, perhaps it was because they had just advanced not too long ago, they didn\u2019t have any combat spells at all.Faced with this group of transcendents that boasted high offensive and defensive power, Roel was practically trading a blow for a blow. He used a hand to grab the searing hands to hold them in place while using his Spell Gloves to smash the other party\u2019s face with all his might.After knocking out the most troublesome fellow to deal with, he quickly moved on to the stonelike fellow, using a Muay Thai move that consisted of holding the other party\u2019s shoulders down while kneeing upward, aiming straight at the other party\u2019s crotch.\u201cAHHH\u2014\u201dA scream of agony sounded as Roel downed yet another enemy. It was an impressive feat for him to have downed 9 out of 11 enemies alone, but he paid a heavy price for it. His clothes were tattered, a hand was blistering from being exposed to searing heat, and his knee was bleeding profusely from the tremendous impact.Even Alicia couldn\u2019t help but cry after seeing Roel in such a state.In any case, Roel\u2019s battle accomplishment thus far had thoroughly traumatized the remaining Luke and Shawn, making them not dare to step forward at all. Just one sharp look from Roel was more than enough to make them tremble in fear.\u201cR-Roel, it wasn\u2019t our intention to bother the Ascart House. We wouldn\u2019t dare. I-it\u2019s Bron who made us bring Alicia over!\u201d\u201cY-yes, we weren\u2019t intending on bullying her this year at all! We\u2019re speaking the truth!\u201dShawn and Luke\u2019s words made the fatigued Roel blink his eyes quietly. He slowly processed the words of the duo before nodding his head comprehendingly.\u201cSo, you\u2019re the scoundrels who bullied my little sister all this while?\u201d\u201cAh? N-no, that\u2019s not what we meant\u2026\u201d\u201cForget it. Crawl your way out of this room, and I\u2019ll let you off.\u201dRoel pointed to the doorway with a smile.The two of them shot a hesitant glance at one another before nodding in resolution.\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll do it!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll crawl our way out, but\u2026 you must keep your end of the promise!\u201dUnder Roel\u2019s implicit approval, the two of them got to their knees and began crawling their way out. Yet, to their horror, Roel suddenly took this opportunity to direct four sharp kicks toward their crotchesKacha!\u201cAHH\u2014! Y-you!\u201d\u201cImbeciles. You sure believed my words easily. Even a fool would know that I wouldn\u2019t let the two of you off after what you have done to my little sister!\u201dRoel simply sneered at the pair.In truth, he had overexerted himself to the point where he could hardly lift his hands anymore. Even the kicks he had aimed at them were a little strained. Had it been a proper fight, he might have lost to them, but it was fortunate that they were already scared out of their wits and ended up being duped.\u201cBut yes, I\u2019m a person of my words. You can crawl out now. You can be assured that I won\u2019t chase you anymore.\u201dRoel spoke to them smilingly. However, he suddenly noticed that there was something amiss with the expressions of the two. At the same time, Alicia\u2019s voice sounded as well.\u201cBe careful!\u201dRoel only managed to turn his body around before a dagger plunged straight into his stomach.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - Something I Have To DoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43: Something I Have To Do\u201cBig brother Roel!\u201d\u201cDie, die! I\u2019ll send you to the depths of hell!\u201dCreeping up on Roel from behind was a bloodied Bron. His suave face was already ruined from being smashed into the table, and there were wooden splinters embedded in his face. His sharp nose bridge, that was once a source of pride, had collapsed downward, and his reddened eyes reflected his berserk state.Baffling baboons! I have already smashed his head into the table, and he\u2019s still able to climb back up?Roel had underestimated the resilience of an Origin Level 6 transcendent. He didn\u2019t think that Bron would be able to recover so quickly from his concussion and silently sneak up on him to stab him.A searing pain assaulted Roel as Bron plunged his dagger, which was around the length of a finger, into Roel\u2019s stomach. In this crucial moment, Roel quickly used Focused Burst to tighten his abdominal muscles while reaching out to hold the blade of the dagger in place.\u201cMiscreant, you dare use a dagger against me? Are you tired of living?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of ways to lure you out and deal with you, but who would have thought that you would come knocking of your own accord\u2014and for the sake of this hideous woman? You sure have made things convenient for me!\u201cThere are too many people here who have harmed you. Do you know what this means? It means that spells won\u2019t be able to pinpoint me as the culprit anymore! I\u2019ll be able to get away scot-free even if I slaughter you here! You are the sole son of the Ascart House. If I were to end your lineage right now, I\u2019ll be viewed as the hero of the Elric House!\u201dBron roared furiously as he tried to push the dagger in with all his might.On the other hand, Roel was doing his best to stop the dagger from piercing any deeper. Even though he had nearly depleted his mana and wasn\u2019t able to cast Spell Gloves anymore, he was gripping the dagger tightly in place through sheer tenacity.A pair of golden eyes met a pair of green eyes, one impassively cold and the other ferociously vicious. Just like that, the two of them wrestled in this life-and-death tug-o-war.As time went by, Roel\u2019s hands began to shake.The earlier battle caused his left hand to be seared to the point where it couldn\u2019t be used anymore, and his right arm was bleeding profusely from holding onto the sharp blade. He couldn\u2019t sustain Controlled Breathing anymore, and his mana was down to the dregs. In comparison, while Bron was faring horribly too, his state was at least better than Roel\u2019s.\u201cHahaha, you have run out of strength now, haven\u2019t you? I can feel your grip loosening by the moment!\u201dBron mocked coldly as he grit his teeth and pushed the dagger millimeter by millimeter deeper into Roel\u2019s stomach, causing blood to spurt out yet again.A victorious smile had emerged on Bron\u2019s face; he was so certain that victory was already within his grasp that he failed to notice the person charging forth from behind.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013This mustn\u2019t do. I must help big brother Roel!The trembling Alicia thought frantically.The battle had already reached its climax, and Roel and Bron were tussling with one another. In Alicia\u2019s view, Bron Elric had already gone completely mad. He was really intending to kill Roel and her.She knew that she had to help her older brother, but she had no idea what she could do to make a difference.Despite her powerful bloodline, she was still far too young. She was only at Origin Level 7 at the moment. There was far too large a gap between Origin Level 7 and Origin Level 6, be it in terms of strength, speed, or resilience.Was it really a hopeless situation?No, there was still a way out.The oldest humans had discovered a way to significantly increase their fighting ability, so as to gain the strength to deal with enemies that would have otherwise been beyond their means\u2014weapons.The silver-haired girl looked at the bloodstained knife on the table, and her body instinctively trembled wildly in aversion.This was the knife that had been waved right before her eyes just a moment ago.To Alicia, this was an object that was more frightening than any other weapon out there in the world. Had it been the past her, she wouldn\u2019t have even dared to spare a glance at it.However, her eyes were set on it at this very moment. Despite the tears that were flowing uncontrollably, she forced herself not to avert her eyes from it.She had always thought that it was a bizarre world she lived in. There were so many frightening things to be feared, yet so few wonderful things to be cherished. That day, when Roel first personally fed her, she thought she saw happiness knocking on her door for the first time.As frightening as the knife was, she was a hundred times, no, a thousand times more frightened of losing Roel and the cherished happiness that had finally come to her.Move, my body! Move!The little girl screamed at herself in her mind as she forced herself to grab hold of that bloodstained knife. It should have been something so light, but it weighed a ton to her. An unknown strength rising from the depths of her heart brought her the courage to willingly lift it up for the first time since that incident.I must protect Lord Brother!With tears in her eyes, Alicia bit her lips in resolution as she charged toward the nightmare that was threatening to take away her everything.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Splitch.The sound of a knife stabbing into a person\u2019s body sounded for the second time in the room. Bron Elric\u2019s body jolted as he turned around to look behind him with widened eyes.Behind him, a trembling Alicia had already pushed the knife into his back. Blood had spurted all over her body, and her hands were shaking ceaselessly. Yet, gritting her teeth tenaciously, she continued to pour her strength forth to push the knife further in.\u201cAHHH\u2014\u201dA shriek that could have otherwise come from a slaughtered pig sounded from Bron\u2019s mouth. The excruciating pain on his back caused him to release the handle of the dagger as he swung his arm around and smacked the silver-haired girl behind him flying. Then, he hurriedly touched his own wound.With a cry of agony, Alicia was slammed into a wall before collapsing to the ground, spewing a mouthful of blood.This sight made Roel see red. Gathering every last bit of strength he had in his body, he hurled his fist toward Bron with a deafening roar.\u201cYou bastard!\u201dPah! Krk!A powerful fist carrying all of Roel\u2019s rage shot right into Bron\u2019s chin, producing the cracking sound of a fracture. The sheer force sent Bron flying through the air in an arc before slamming down hard onto the table behind him.Bam!The attack caused the golden-haired boy\u2019s eyes to roll upward as white foam dribbled down his mouth. His body twitched around like a fish on the shore.Roel pulled out the knife from his stomach and held it with both hands as he stabbed it right down to pin Bron firmly onto the table.\u201cAhhh you\u2026 Wuuu\u2026\u201dThe intense pain temporarily brought Bron back to consciousness as he groaned feebly, but soon, he fainted once more due to the concussion from the earlier blow. Roel shot him one last glance before heading over to the fainted Alicia while clutching his stomach.\u201cAlicia?\u201dRoel quickly took a look at Alicia\u2019s condition, and to his relief, it appeared that the blood she spewed out earlier came from an injury in her mouth and not something more severe. Heaving a sigh of relief, he slowly sat down while groaning in pain.Tsk, my wounds are too heavy this time around. I think my rib cage has fractured too.Roel, whose consciousness was starting to fade away, quickly shook his head to keep himself awake. It was at this moment that flurried footsteps sounded from the corridor.Bang!The door shot open, and yet another group of children ran in. Upon seeing the tragic sight in the room, they exclaimed in horror.\u201cBig brother Bron!\u201d\u201cWho? Who\u2019s the one who did it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s him! He\u2019s not one of our own!\u201dSeeing their unconscious companions lying all around, the agitated group, who were clearly Bron\u2019s allies, soon noticed Roel, and they charged over with furious roars.Roel\u2019s face immediately turned grim. He tried pushing himself off the ground, but he was far too weak for that right now.At this crucial moment, a figure suddenly stood between the group of children and Roel, Nora Xeclyde. She coldly ordered the group.\u201cStop.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - Arrows of DissensionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 44: Arrows of DissensionNora Xeclyde glanced at the devastated body of the black-haired boy behind her with a conflicted look on her face. She spoke words only she and Roel could hear.\u201cI do want to see you troubled and helpless, but seeing you reveal such an expression toward another person really does displease me.\u201d\u201cJust what kind of eccentric possessiveness is it that you have there?\u201d\u201cProbably loathing toward those who fiddle with my toy?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Tsk, you are beyond cure.\u201d\u201cBeyond cure? Perhaps so, but now\u2026\u201dNora\u2019s lips had inched upward a little out of amusement from the short conversation she had with Roel, but in the next moment, as she turned her head around, all that was left was chilling displeasure.\u201cIs there anything else that you need here?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Your Highness, I apologize for my rudeness, but this is a personal affair between us and him.\u201dThe boy leading the pack glanced at the pitiful state that Bron was in, and the fear rising from the depths of his heart told him that he had to at least attempt something here. Otherwise, he would be caught by Bron\u2019s wrath in the aftermath of this incident.There\u2019s a common saying amongst those trapped in bureaucracy, \u2018my subordinate\u2019s subordinate is not my subordinate\u2019. As high as Nora\u2019s standing was, as formidable as the royal family was, they were not the ones in direct command of the young nobles gathered here.\u201cWe don\u2019t have any intention of disrespecting you. We just wish to exact vengeance for our friends.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. We are only looking for that boy behind you!\u201d\u201cOh, is that so?\u201dNora coldly eyed the noisy bunch of misfits standing before her before glancing at the other ten incapacitated children and Bron. Then, she nodded empathetically and smiled.\u201cI see. It\u2019s a really touching friendship that you have over here. Bron Elric sure has a lot of friends around. Unknowingly, he has already befriended so many young nobles in our Theocracy.\u201dThe brighter Nora\u2019s smile grew, the more hostile her gaze became. This bunch of fools thought that they were discreet in amassing a bit of clout and building up their faction, but Nora had already long found out about this so-called \u2018Elric Youth Faction\u2019 from the royal intelligence reports.There was no royal family that could possibly tolerate their subordinates building up their own large factions and amassing great influence, let alone something that aimed to involve an entire generation of noble subjects.Nora turned around, bent over, and looked Roel in the eye.\u201cIn contrast, Mister Roel Ascart over here appears to be quite miserable by comparison. It seems like I\u2019m the only friend that you have here.\u201d\u201c\u2026 But you aren\u2019t mywuuu\u2014!\u201dRoel\u2019s attempted rejection was thwarted by a palm covering his mouth.\u201cEven though it\u2019s adorable to see you talking tough, I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re in a good position to refuse my help. After all, you aren\u2019t alone right now.\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dNora\u2019s words made the muffled Roel stop his little act of rebellion, and his eyes slid over to glance at the unconscious Alicia lying beside him. With a solemn look on his face, he slowly fell silent.Nora slowly removed her hand before turning to look at Alicia, who was still being protected by Roel despite the horrendous state he was in. She couldn\u2019t help feeling a little envious.\u201cJust like how you feel obliged to exact vengeance for your friends, I am also obliged to protect my own friend.\u201dNora quickly readjusted her mood before turning back to look at the dumbfounded crowd standing before her.\u201cAs the master of this manor, I\u2019m formally requesting that you leave this place.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNora\u2019s words caused the noble rabble in the room to fall silent. They looked at one another for support. Their relationship with and fear of the Elric House made them hesitate, but their hesitation only served to further infuriate Nora.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you intending to disregard the authority of a Xeclyde? I see\u2026 Make your move then.\u201d\u201cAh? No, we are\u2026\u201dComing to the limit of her patience, Nora finally dropped her smile. Rampaging mana burst forth from her skin and a shimmering pair of wings formed from light coalesced behind her. A powerful pressure crushed down on the surroundings.Roel felt as if his blood had frozen in place, making him shudder. The atmosphere suddenly grew so heavy that he felt like oxygen was being squeezed out of his lungs.Fortunately, this terrifying sensation only lasted for an instant. The pressure quickly receded after.It was likely that Nora was taking care of him. As the feeling disappeared, his breathing swiftly reverted to normal.Roel gazed upon the silhouette of the angel who bore a pair of light wings standing before him with a look of disbelief in his eyes.Origin Level 5.The ability to materialize the disorderly and corrupted mana into the form of one\u2019s imagination could only be achieved through an Origin Attribute, and the minimum requirement for that was to reach Origin Level 5. This was the hallmark of a true transcendent.The problem here was that Nora was only 10 years old\u2026\u201cGahh!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your decision?\u201dUnder Nora\u2019s cold gaze, the young nobles, who were still thinking of making a move a moment ago, fell to the ground like crops being reaped by a scythe. Their natural instincts compelled them to submit to the higher being standing before them. Even the few Origin Level 6s amongst them were shaking like feeble hamsters standing in the face of a lion.\u201cIf you wish to make a move, do it quick. This is the first time I\u2019m dealing with someone of my own age group, but I should tell you that I don\u2019t have the habit of holding back.\u201dNora raised her hand as she gathered a cluster of mana so dense that it actually felt nauseating. Everyone present, with the exception of Roel, couldn\u2019t stop themselves from screaming out of sheer fright.However, halfway through her motion, Nora suddenly seemed to have noticed something. She turned her sight toward the doorway before sighing in disappointment.\u201cIt looks like we\u2019ll have to stop here.\u201dNora dispelled her mana, causing her light wings to dissipate. Everything became calm and peaceful once more. An elegant and tranquil smile, reminiscent of a lady strolling in a flower garden, returned to her face.A moment later, the door burst open, and a group of adults dashed in.\u201cRoel! Alicia!\u201dCarter was the first one to barge in while shouting the names of his children. The first thing that he saw was the tragic state that Bron was in, and he immediately knew that something was amiss. So, he began searching around the room frantically for his two children.It was utter pandemonium afterward.Carter found the severely injured Roel and the unconscious Alicia leaning at the foot of the wall and dashed right over. Prince Kane walked over to Nora and enquired about the happenings from her. A huge following of nobles that entered afterward stumbled upon the horrendous sight in the room. The men gasped in shock, while the women shrieked in horror. Even the servants were flustered.Many of the young nobles present had been scared out of their wits by Nora, such that it wasn\u2019t too hard to get the truth out of them. It also happened that Alicia woke up at this moment. The scene before her made her realize that they had been saved. While trying her best to hold back her tears, she quickly recounted the situation to everyone present.Alicia\u2019s story raised a huge uproar amongst the nobles present. The noblewomen rushed over to give Alicia a hug while berating Bron and his posse, as if venting their rage for similar miseries they had gone through when they were younger.The next ones to step forward were the military men. Alicia\u2019s father, Larthe, was a soldier who had died on the battlefield, which made them treasure Alicia as one of their own too. Hearing that the orphaned Alicia had been put through such torture and humiliation left the military officials deeply enraged. It was made plain that they wouldn\u2019t let this matter slide easily.\u201cWe beseech you to resolve this matter appropriately, commander.\u201dThe members of the Holy Knight Order had a livid look on their faces, and the commander they were addressing, Prince Kane, was no better either. His eyes were burning with murderous intent as he stared at the unconscious Bron on the table.However, there was one person who beat him to it.In the face of public outrage, the man who was viewed by everyone in enmity, Count Bryan Elric, stepped forth and struck Bron in his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A neck had just been snapped.\u201cAH\u2014!\u201d\u201cIn the name of great Sia, what are you doing?!\u201dScreams and horrified exclamations sounded in the air.Everyone who was infuriated at Bron a moment ago was completely stunned. Prince Kane had a look of disbelief on his face. Carter hurriedly covered Alicia\u2019s eyes. Nora had a rare frown on her face. Roel looked at the man who shared the same green eyes with Bron as he felt a chill running down his spine.No one could have thought that Count Bryan had stepped forward, not to save his son, but to snap his neck with a single strike.This man is vicious.Roel\u2019s complexion slowly turned awful.Under normal circumstances, shouldn\u2019t the old one stand forward after the young one failed? That would have given Carter and Kane the justification to condemn the Elric House and make them suffer a heavy price for their actions. Yet, this fellow wasn\u2019t going by the script!Roel looked at the golden-haired count before him, and the latter also happened to turn his head over at the moment, resulting in their gazes meeting one another mid-air. Roel immediately felt his body turning cold, as if he was being stared down by a venomous snake.\u201cBryan, what are you doing?\u201dSensing that Count Bryan was assessing Roel, Carter stepped forward right away to shelter his child behind him, as he narrowed his eyes in hostility. On the other hand, Bryan was silent for a moment before he answered calmly.\u201cNothing much. I\u2019m just taking a look at the young man who stopped Bron\u2019s foolishness.\u201dFollowing that, he turned to face the surrounding crowd and spoke up loudly.\u201cI sincerely apologize on behalf of the Elric House for everything that has happened here. It\u2019s my failure to discipline my children that led to this situation. I have punished Bron for his actions, and we\u2019ll make sure to compensate Miss Alicia for the suffering she has been put through. I ask for your understanding.\u201dThe entire room fell silent after Bryan\u2019s declaration. The sight of him killing his own son left the nobles feeling disconcerted. The military officials, including Kane and Carter, looked at the dead Bron and found themselves unable to say anything either.Noticing the lack of opposition, Bryan walked up to Nora to speak to her.\u201cYour Highness Nora, I am deeply apologetic to have caused such a scandal on your birthday. I humbly ask for your forgiveness.\u201d\u201cCount Bryan, you need not act in such a manner. You have dealt with this matter well.\u201dNora\u2019s insincere compliment was dripping with sarcasm, but Bryan feigned ignorance to it.\u201cYour Highness Kane, I\u2019m afraid that there are many matters I must attend to, so I\u2019ll have to make a move in advance.\u201dBryan bowed slightly before grabbing Bron\u2019s corpse and making his exit. Spectating nobles scrambled to open up a path for Bryan, and it was only after this terrifying man had vanished from sight that they all heaved sighs of relief.Watching as Count Bryan left, Roel felt that he had really underestimated the world of nobles. The old noble houses, having weathered hundreds of years of rise and fall, had matured from the crises they had faced. It was not that they wouldn\u2019t err, but they learned how to deal with mistakes.Bron was an immature fool. From the moment he whipped out his dagger, he was already a goner. Count Bryan, on the other hand, was a perfect product of the standard noble curriculum, valuing his house\u2019s interest above all else. Not even the sentiments of a father got in the way of his judgment.The Elrics might have left, but the matter surrounding the Elric Youth Faction hadn\u2019t been settled yet. Prince Kane had no intention of letting these noble children off the hook easily just because they were young. With a wave of his hand, he had his men take them away.They would be severely punished before being granted permission to leave the manor. Their names would be taken down, and royal edicts would be sent to their houses to inform their families that they had been blacklisted by the royal family. With this, their futures were most certainly ruined.\u201cHow did you find me?\u201dWhile Carter and Kane were dealing with the aftermath of the incident, Roel, who had just undergone emergency treatment, turned to Nora and asked.Nora blinked her eyes before replying calmly.\u201cThat\u2019s because you never came back after being called away by a little girl. I was somewhat curious, so I came over to take a look. It was then that I happened to see that bunch of people barging into this room\u2026 Perhaps this is what you call fate?\u201dFate, my ass!Roel snorted in response to Nora\u2019s words as he slowly recalled everything that happened before he made his way here.After parting from Alicia at the banquet, certified foodie Roel didn\u2019t hold back before the enticement of the buffet table. Holding a plate in hand, he delightfully hopped from one dish to the other and gorged himself thoroughly. It was only due to his graceful eating etiquette that he barely managed to not look out of place.But halfway through his feast, Roel noticed that the number of boys in the banquet hall had reduced considerably, which brought his train of thoughts to the Elric Youth Faction. Thinking of them left him feeling a little uneasy inside, so he headed over to the girls who were in his faction to check out the situation, only to bump into a girl who witnessed Bron\u2019s group taking Alicia away.When Roel learned that someone was bullying his little sister, he told the little girl to find Carter while he took out a tool he had bought on discount from the Affection Points Shop in the last few months and headed over to look for his little sister first.\u3010Shadow LoverLove without roots, feelings abounded. The lover in the shadow bleeds dry, only to be thought of as a stream of warm tears.\u3011Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was yet another description that was useless except for its poetic value. Shadow Lover was a red cloth, made of a translucent material similar to bridal veils.After several months of experimentation, Roel managed to uncover the ability of this red cloth. As long as he had it on in a dark environment, his presence would utterly vanish, reminiscent of the lover that no one knew of depicted in the description.This was also why Roel was able to suddenly appear behind Bron earlier on. His initial plan was to take them out one by one discreetly, but when he saw Bron\u2019s actions and heard Alicia\u2019s crying, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to bide his time anymore. This was what resulted in the eventual 1v12.While many things had happened, in truth, only 5 minutes had elapsed between the moment Roel entered the room and when he pinned Bron to the table. Nora followed by Carter and the other adults barged into the room about 7 minutes after the start of the incident.Roel could have waited it out until reinforcements arrived before making a move, but he didn\u2019t want to do so, especially when he knew that Alicia could have been traumatized for good had he chosen to wait. He ended up sustaining severe injuries due to that, but he didn\u2019t regret his decision. Those around him also expressed their approval toward his actions.\u201cLad, you\u2019ve done well!\u201d\u201cIt was a battle well fought!\u201d\u201cAs expected of an Ascart, you didn\u2019t embarrass us!\u201dPrince Kane and the other members of the Holy Knight Order commended Roel for his actions and accomplishments. Carter couldn\u2019t help but feel gleeful hearing the praises heaped on his son, but he still maintained a grave look on his face.\u201cYou did well protecting Alicia this time, but you shouldn\u2019t act recklessly the next time you encounter such a situation. Rely on me more!\u201d\u201cI understand, father.\u201dRoel humbly responded to the compliments of the men around him while shooting a glance at Alicia. As he watched her thank the circle of noblewomen around her for their concern with a smile, he couldn\u2019t help but recall the scene of her picking up a knife and stabbing Bron.He was indeed relieved to have been saved by her, but no matter how he looked at it, such an action was too extreme for someone of her age. He couldn\u2019t think of it as a good thing. Would this matter leave some kind of trauma behind?It looks like I\u2019ll have to pay careful heed to this in the future.The doting black-haired boy thought to himself before everything suddenly faded to black.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 - Alicia Is a TreasurePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 46: Alicia Is a TreasureHave you ever put your life on the line for another person?When Roel first saw this question on a social media platform in his previous life, he was rendered speechless.Bro, open your eyes and look at the era we\u2019re living in! Who are you even going to pit your life against?In the modern era, where the pen was much mightier than the sword, physical brawls had become extremely rare, let alone life and death battles. This was even more so in first world countries. One could get stopped by uniformed uncles just by strolling around with a knife in hand!Roel scoffed at the question, thinking that there would never be a day where he would have to put his life on the line for another person, at least till now.In the original storyline, the suffering that Alicia went through under Bron fractured the relations between Alicia and Roel, planting an unshakable death flag for him there. However, since he had intervened this time around, the situation should be different from before.That being said, the price paid for the intervention was really not to be scoffed at.After knocking out 12 opponents, Roel\u2019s left hand was burned and his right hand suffered a deep cut. His arms and knees were mashed up, and several of his ribs had fractured. While the wound in his stomach wasn\u2019t fatal, it was still quite deep. Aside from these major injuries, his body was also covered with cuts and abrasions. Plenty of blood had been lost too.In the end, Roel\u2019s body couldn\u2019t take it any longer and he passed out. Were it not for the existence of transcendental abilities in this world, he would have been bedridden for a very long time.\u201cAh, ah. Ouch ouch ouch\u2026\u201dOn top of a bed, an unconscious black-haired boy was rudely awoken by all the aching pains coming from his body. Even before opening his eyes, he was already groaning in agony. His body moved instinctively in response to his misery and one of his wounds was pulled at, jolting him fully awake in an instant.With a sharp intake of breath between clenched teeth, Roel opened his eyes. He immediately began scanning his surroundings. The ceiling was quite beautiful with a mural depicting a holy maiden, a fashion trend from a hundred years ago. There were also many decorative ornaments and artworks hanging on the walls. The red carpet and the vibrant-colored furniture in the room looked pretty lavish.This was a room inside the Labyrinth Villa.The familiar environment set Roel\u2019s heart at ease. It was then that he noticed a girl sitting beside him.Silver hair flowed down her shoulders. She had a face that was beautiful yet aloof, giving off the impression that she was unapproachable. She was currently dozing lightly on a chair beside the bed. Her tranquil sleeping face softened the coldness of her features, giving it an adorable touch instead. It made Roel\u2019s heart pound a little.This lass is really getting more and more beautiful by the day.Roel couldn\u2019t help but stare at her for a while, appreciating her beauty before inwardly sighing deeply.Alicia will only continue to become more gorgeous in the future. The Silverash Bloodline pursues the highest level of perfection, after all. Tsk, it feels like there\u2019ll be a lot of bugs by her side in the future\u2026Roel stroked his lower jaw contemplatively as he fell into deep thought.The incident with Bron made him realize that Alicia, as one of the main capture targets, was bound to face even more trouble in the future. It would be annoying, but there was nothing to be feared since the solution was very simple.He would just have to drag all those scoundrels out under the sun and murder them socially in the name of justice.Of course, Roel wouldn\u2019t be taking responsibility if any of them were to have their neck snapped by their own father for being an embarrassment to their house. That would be their own household affair; he wasn\u2019t going to take the blame for that.It was then that Roel suddenly recalled the golden-haired man he met that day, and his heart suddenly felt a little heavy.Bryan Elric.He was truly a terrifying man.As the saying went, \u2018not even the most vicious of tigers preyed on its cubs\u2019.While the revelation of Bron\u2019s misdeeds had brought about public outrage, such that it would have been impossible for Bron to take over the house anymore, it still didn\u2019t change the fact that he was a child of the Elric House. The privileges of the Five Eminent Noble Houses were not for show. Strictly speaking, even the Xeclydes couldn\u2019t pass judgment on Bron directly; they had to go through the Theocracy\u2019s courts.There were many strings that one could pull in the courtroom. The Elric House might not be as prosperous as it was 200 years ago, but they had been rising quickly in recent decades. It shouldn\u2019t be too difficult for them to preserve the life of a boy who hadn\u2019t committed murder.Yet, in order to swiftly appease public outrage and avoid implicating his house, Count Bryan acted decisively, granting his son a quick death before anyone could even stop him. His lack of feelings toward his own progeny was truly frightening, and the attitude he had back then\u2026Bron was a typical lawless little rascal. His domineering personality could have been a product of complacency, due to the swift expansion of the Elric House\u2019s influence over the last decade. Nevertheless, there was still too big of a difference between his character and his father\u2019s.Roel had a feeling that Bron wasn\u2019t being valued as the successor, that no one had tried to discipline and educate him before.In any case, all Roel felt from Bryan was bad vibes. He wouldn\u2019t want to become the enemy of this vicious man if there was any other choice. However, just from the look Bryan shot him back then, it was quite clear that the die had already been cast.But so what? Alicia is a treasure from the gods. Anyone who tries to hurt her deserves death! No exceptions whatsoever!1 reply\u00a0\u2013 1 hour agoAfter venting his emotions, Roel felt a little calmer.Now that he thought about it, from the perspective of the Ascart House, such developments weren\u2019t too bad either.The Ascarts and the Xeclydes had been on good terms with each other ever since the March Turmoil, but the other four of the Five Eminent Noble Houses tended to waver in their positions. The Elric House was even publicly known to be on bad terms with the royal family.This incident would remind the Xeclydes that several generations of lax governance had led to the breeding of toxic flies amongst them. These toxic flies threatened to overthrow what the Theocracy originally stood for, and they had already started huddling around the shitpile known as the Elric House.Once a rival faction successfully gained substantial power, they would grow dissatisfied with being in a position of subordination, leading them to eventually challenge the Xeclydes\u2019 authority. This was an inevitable turn of events brought about by a conflict of interest, and Prince Kane and the others should have realized it through this matter.If things had gone according to the original storyline, Bron\u2019s faction would have continued to amass influence as his subordinates inherited their houses and took on positions of power. It would have spelled a disastrous catastrophe for the Theocracy.\u201cWait a moment, now that I think about it, Nora once said in the game that a revolt had occurred in the Theocracy. Could that revolt have stemmed from Bron and his faction?\u201dWas it a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat? Or did they try to exert political pressure to force the Xeclydes to abdicate?Roel pondered with a frown. He was only starting to realize just how big an impact his actions had made on the future. Since the Xeclydes had been awoken from their slumber, they would surely spare no effort in trimming away the decaying and withered leaves amongst the nobles.That was, after all, the job of the royal family.The Xeclydes would also deal with the Elric House too, but since Bron was dead, it would be hard for them to find a legitimate reason to flex their authority right away.It was while Roel was deep in thought that the silver-haired girl dozing-off nearby woke up from her nap.With a light yawn, she slowly opened her eyes and saw that Roel was now awake. Her eyes immediately went wide as she leaped to her feet.\u201cBig brother Roel!\u201d\u201cHm? You\u2019re awake, Alicia. I saw that you were sleeping, so I didn\u2019t wake\u2026 Ahhh? Why are you crying?\u201dWatching tears stream down Alicia\u2019s cheeks, Roel began to panic a little. Her tears somehow held the power to make his heart feel a little jittery.\u201cI\u2019m fine, big brother Roel. I\u2019m just finding it hard to hold back my emotions.\u201dAlicia wiped off her tears as she tried to keep her feelings in check. Then, she leaped onto the bed and wrapped her arms around Roel\u2019s neck.\u201cI love you, big brother Roel!\u201d(Affection Points +50,000!)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Way too green!This was the first thought that came to Roel\u2019s mind as Alicia wrapped her arms around him.That\u2019s 50,000 Affection Points! What in the world? Do I even earn that much in a month?Roel was shaken by the green light blazing above Alicia\u2019s head, to the point that he was screaming inside his head frenziedly. But thinking more about it, it appeared that he hadn\u2019t received any Affection Points from Alicia throughout the \u2018Bron incident\u2019. Was this the grand total of what he had earned?Ah, that makes sense then.Roel shot a glance at his broken arms and legs, and he suddenly felt that it was all worth it even if it was just for this sum of Affection Points. As his shock gradually calmed down, his attention naturally wandered off to other sensations, such as\u2026How soft, warm, and fragrant!Roel thought as he stroked Alicia\u2019s hair. The texture felt a thousand times better than stroking a cat, stoking up a profound sense of satisfaction in his heart.\u201cI love you, Lord Brother.\u201dAlicia said with a voice slightly hoarse from crying.Her sudden proclamation of love made Roel\u2019s heart skip a beat, and he felt a slightly itchy feeling in his chest.\u201cAlicia?\u201d\u201cLord Brother, do you love me?\u201d\u201cAh? I-I\u2026\u201dRoel didn\u2019t expect to be suddenly bombarded with this question, such that he was stunned for a moment.Alicia released her hold and stared at Roel eye-to-eye. There seemed to be a torrent of emotions raging in her eyes, as if she was trying to convey something to him.\u201c\u2026\u201dRoel\u2019s eyes widened a little. From the solemn expression on Alicia\u2019s face and her trembling fingers, he could tell that it was not the time for him to be joking around. He could sense that she was feeling nervous, perhaps terrified even.She was afraid of being rejected.Is this a side effect from what Bron had said to her during the banquet? Or is it a manifestation of the unease she felt from seeing me getting stabbed back then. But in any case\u2026There was no way Roel could bring himself to reject her.\u201cI love you too, Alicia.\u201dRoel said dotingly as he reached out to hug the trembling little girl in front of him. Alicia burst into joyful tears.Outside the room, Anna, who was peeping through the cracks of the door, was moved to tears by what she saw. Biting her handkerchief in agitation, she lightly closed the door shut before turning around to face the huge army of servants standing behind her.\u201cOur young master and young miss\u2026 are an item now! Uwuuuu\u2026\u201d\u201cR-really?\u201d\u201cYay\u2014! Long live our young miss!\u201d\u201cOur Ascart House is saved!\u201dThe \u2018Roel X Alicia Ship\u2019 fan club members cheered joyfully upon hearing the news that Anna had brought them. The ones who were the most touched of all were the servants working for Alicia.\u201cAnna, are you certain about this?\u201d\u201cOf course! How could I possibly be mistaken?\u201dAnna, who was still wiping her tears a moment ago, straightened her back and stood with a dignified air as soon as she heard someone questioning her credibility. She quickly recounted the proclamations of love made to one another on the bed earlier, causing the other servants to gasp in agitation.\u201cBut given the young master and young miss\u2019 age, could it just be kinship?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t refute the possibility, but considering how mature our young master and miss are, I believe that there\u2019s a larger proportion of romantic love in their relationship.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I also think that it\u2019s romantic love too!\u201dThe members of the fan club discussed fervently with one another over this matter, but none of them were able to accurately capture the thoughts that were in Roel\u2019s mind at this very instant.\u2026She\u2019s really like a cat.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis was the thought in Roel\u2019s mind as he stroked Alicia\u2019s silky hair. It felt like he was patting a particularly clingy cat. Thinking more deeply into it, there were indeed a lot of similarities between Alicia and cats.Like how they looked docile but were actually very guarded against others; like how they stood dignified and gracefully, rarely trying to display intimacy; like how they were very sensitive toward their surroundings.Of course, there were significant differences between them too. Alicia was unable to fully conceal her emotions. She was sensitive but fragile. She sought to love and be loved. Behind her aloof exterior, there was a warm heart beating.Roel would have to go through many hurdles and obstacles in order to bring out her true self. The main character managed to accomplish all of this with great difficulty in the game, but Roel was fortunate that he was able to meet Alicia many years in advance. At the very least, he was able to reduce her suffering and alleviate her loneliness.She wouldn\u2019t kill me anymore.Roel, who finally recalled the storyline of the game, nodded to himself confidently.\u201cLord Brother.\u201d\u201cYes? What is it?\u201dRoel was in the midst of celebrating his small victory when he heard the little girl\u2019s voice and turned his head over. Alicia\u2019s head was leaning on his shoulder, and she spoke with a choked-up voice.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It was because of me that you sustained such heavy injuries. If only I wasn\u2019t taken away by them\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat in the world are you talking about? You are the victim here! What are you apologizing for?\u201dRoel\u2019s expression turned grave as he spoke with a firm voice.\u201cIt\u2019s Bron and his group of cronies who inflicted harm on us. They\u2019re the ones who should be apologizing and punished for their actions! So, don\u2019t be silly and take the blame for this matter. If any jackass tries to say otherwise, tell me and I\u2019ll break his leg!\u201d\u201cLord Brother.\u201dAlicia was deeply moved by Roel\u2019s words, but at the same time, she couldn\u2019t help but recall some matters.\u201cAfter this incident, it\u2019s likely that there\u2019s already no room for reconciliation between the Ascart House and Elric House.\u201d\u201c\u2026 That can\u2019t be helped. Our paths differ from one another in the first place, not to mention that there\u2019s already a deep grudge between us. It was only a matter of time before this happened, so there\u2019s no need for you to pay it any heed.\u201dAlicia fell silent once more. She recalled the look Bryan Elric shot Roel back then, and after a long moment of silence, she finally spoke with conviction.\u201cI\u2019ll protect you, Lord Brother.\u201d\u201cHm? Ah\u2026 Oh.\u201dRoel blinked his eyes in surprise at Alicia\u2019s sudden remark. He didn\u2019t understand the resolution behind those words, and Alicia, despite having noticed it, didn\u2019t bother to explain either. Her crimson eyes narrowed a little before slowly loosening up once more as she silently buried the vow she had just made in the depths of her heart.\u201cBut speaking of that, haven\u2019t you already protected me once?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dRoel pointed to his own stomach and explained to the confused Alicia.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you bravely stepping in back then, my injuries would have been more severe. You have already protected me once.\u201d\u201cI-I wasn\u2019t\u2026 I wasn\u2019t thinking of anything at all. I was afraid, afraid of losing you. It was so terrifying that I\u2026\u201dAlicia\u2019s voice became choked-up once more. Recalling the overwhelming fear she felt back then made her tug Roel even tighter than before. It was as if she was afraid that he would suddenly disappear into thin air.Sensing this, Roel stroked her head and spoke comforting words.\u201cBut you still saved me. I never thought that you would overcome your fear and pick up the knife. You are more courageous than I imagined.\u201d\u201c\u2026 It wasn\u2019t courage. It was a fear triumphing over another. As compared to losing you, the knife wasn\u2019t scary at all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAlicia\u2019s earnest words left Roel a bit shaken. Something stirred in his heart, leaving him with misting eyes. After a long moment of silence, he nodded his head heavily before leaning it against Alicia\u2019s.\u201cIs that so\u2026\u201dRoel muttered softly before the room settled into silence, leaving two hearts leaning against one another, beating silently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - An Unfulfilled ProphecyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48: An Unfulfilled ProphecyDeep in the night, Bryan Elric walked down the corridor of the Elric House\u2019s mansion in the Holy Capital. In this silent building, his footsteps echoed particularly loudly. Moonlight shone through the window to cast its cold light upon his body, making him appear even more chilling.At the end of the corridor, Bryan took out a key, opened a door, and walked in. Beyond the door stood the item that he was looking for\u2014a mercury mirror.This mirror was around the height of a human, and it was designed in a manner that made it look like a door that one could pass through.And that was how it was intended to be used too.Bryan stood before the mirror and looked at his calm yet slightly livid expression. He raised his hand and knocked on the mirror.\u201cLybit, open the door.\u201dThere was a slight ripple on the surface of the mirror before an eye suddenly materialized in the middle of the mirror. The eye turned to look at Bryan before dissipating.Following that, powerful pulsations of mana emanated from the mirror before it suddenly swung open like a door, revealing a hunched old man holding a key in his hand.The hunched old man bowed deeply to Bryan.\u201cWelcome back, vice guild leader.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dBryan nodded quietly to acknowledge the greeting before walking through the mirror door. The scenery around him swiftly changed into that of a dark castle.Connoisseur Guild Saint Mesit Theocracy Headquarters\u2014this was the name of the castle that was permanently submerged in darkness. It was the cradle of a bunch of lunatics who were obsessed with \u2018art\u2019.\u201cThe Collector\u2026 I\u2019m referring to the guild leader, is he here yet?\u201d\u201cYes yes, he\u2019s already here. However, you have arrived late. We just finished an auction.The hunched old man followed Bryan\u2019s footsteps as he explained with a subservient smile, hoping that he could catch the eye of this enigmatic vice guild leader with his words. That being said, he didn\u2019t bear much expectation.To his surprise though, it appeared that Bryan did have an order for him to handle.\u201cMy bloodline, ten years old. He has lost a bit of blood. To what extent will you be able to do it if I were to entrust him to you?\u201d\u201cTen years old? A boy?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cPlease allow me some time to think about it. Er\u2026 If the corpse is still intact, I should be able to get 20 more years for you with my skills!\u201d replied the hunched old man with a fawning chuckle.Bryan looked at the hunched old man impassively for a moment before nodding his head.\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll leave it to you from now on then. You\u2019ll be satisfied with the payment.\u201d\u201cHehehe, I won\u2019t disappoint you!\u201cAre you done speaking? I have a meeting with the guild leader to attend.\u201d\u201cYes yes, I\u2019m done. Please go on ahead!\u201dThe old man dared not speak incessantly in Bryan\u2019s presence. He lowered his back subserviently as he saw the latter off into the darkness ahead.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Bryan\u2019s mood lifted a little after placing his \u2018order\u2019.The last few days had been quite vexing for him. His plan fell to shambles, and the Xeclydes and Ascarts had begun working together to exert pressure on him. Other fiefdoms also began making moves against the Elric House both in the open and in the shadows, resulting in business negotiations falling through and sanctions being imposed.This had caused that bunch of good-for-nothing nobles under him to fall into a fluster. They scrambled to him and wailed about how Bron had been a bad influence for their children and so on.Bryan knew deep down what they wanted behind that superficial act of theirs\u2014they sought the secrets of longevity.Yes, this was all a trade. In exchange for their loyalty to the Elric House and their children joining Bron\u2019s following, the ailing nobles would be bestowed with a way for them to continue living, and perhaps, even making a \u2018full recovery\u2019.Of course, Bryan didn\u2019t put in so much effort just to build up his child\u2019s influence. It was all just a part of his plans.\u201cDid it fail? It\u2019s unexpected to hear that your plan fell through. Were you unable to meet the conditions?\u201d\u201cNo, a ruthless successor and a large group of followers; I already met the conditions for it. The timing was also perfect, but the prophecy still fell through for some inexplicable reason.\u201dOn one end of a long table, Bryan took a sip of tea as he spoke placidly. He had put in quite a bit of effort to ensure the fulfillment of the prophecy this time around, spending over a year to build up the scenario. He had also used all sorts of means during the banquet to direct others away from the scene, so as to create the necessary environment for Bron to accomplish what was expected of him.But, he never thought that the supposedly untalented Roel would actually be different from the rumors. They should have been able to either rally him over to their side or kill him, but his unexpected strength allowed him to stand his ground against Bron and his followers. After a grueling battle, the one who climbed out alive from the bloodstained room turned out to be him.An inconspicuous frown of frustration formed on Bryan\u2019s impassive face as he thought about the incident.On the opposite end of the long table, however, a dark figure cloaked in shadows chuckled softly.\u201cFor the prophecy to actually fall through\u2026 Labi will go on another one of his hysterical rampages once he learns about it. This is indeed a little troublesome. It\u2019s a relief that it\u2019s no longer possible for Carter to awaken anymore, but his son could pose a problem. Our failure to bring him over to our side or kill him might spell trouble for us in the future.\u201d\u201cBut hasn\u2019t the Ascart House already lost the method to awaken?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Based on the records, ever since Caroline Ascart went berserk at the start of the Third Epoch, the heritage of their house has already been severed. However, there\u2019s something bizarre about that house. Once every few centuries, an abnormal individual who defies all common sense would appear amongst them. Over the past thousand years, there have already been two patriarchs who have awakened on their own.\u201dThe dark figure tapped his finger on the wooden table as he recalled the legendary house that was gradually being dragged into the darkness by the grinding gears of time.\u201cThe bloodline of that clan has been divided into seven parts ever since the Second Epoch. The only lineage that is still faring well is the Ascarts, who have chosen to seek refuge with the Theocracy. Yet, that family still manages to pull off the impossible.\u201cThey have already lost their heritage, yet their patriarchs are still able to pull through using just the ordinary Three Main Origin Attributes\u2026 There\u2019s just something peculiar about their house that allows them to continue defying fate over the past thousand years. Even when they\u2019re in decline, I can\u2019t help but feel unnerved by them.\u201dThe words spoken by the guild leader made Bryan\u2019s frown tighten a little. He took a while to contemplate those words before he finally asked calmly.\u201cShould we make a move again?\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s no need for that. Prophesy isn\u2019t our exclusive domain. Besides, there\u2019s no need to further drag your Elric House down into the swamp. The news that the Ascarts might usher in another awakened individual has already sparked the nerves of many people. We can be assured that one of them will make a move in order to stifle the danger in the cradle.\u201d\u201cBut that boy has close relations with the successor of the Xeclydes. The chances of a successful assassination are\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Xeclydes are another troublesome house to deal with, but it matters not\u2026 Here, why don\u2019t you have a look at the painting that I have recently collected?\u201dThe dark figure snapped his finger, and a scroll painting slowly unfurled itself in midair. It depicted a street mired in chaos; a black-haired boy and a golden-haired girl were supporting one another as they trudged ahead.\u201cIt looks like trouble will be knocking on their doorsteps very soon.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Heart of Flames, Fear as FuelPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49: Heart of Flames, Fear as FuelAlicia Ascart went through one of the happiest days of her life.Before entering the Ascart House, the time that Alicia had with her loved ones had always been limited. Her father, Larthe, due to his duties in the Knight Order, was rarely home, so spending long dull days with the servants was her norm.But those days were broken the day her father suddenly left her.She was adopted by the man her father died protecting, Marquess Carter.In truth, Alicia did not have a good impression of Marquess Carter initially. No matter how mature or understanding she could be at other times, there was no way for her to reconcile herself with the situation and view favorably the man who took her father away from her.That was why she was always respectful but distant to Marquess Carter. That was the limit of her self-control.She treated Roel the same way during their first meeting too.Alicia had actually heard of the vile rumors surrounding Roel prior to their first meeting, which was why she was trembling with trepidation the first time they met. She was afraid that he would become her new nightmare, just like those many others she had met before.Thankfully, her worries proved to be unfounded this time.Roel treated her far better than her wildest imagination. She never had any siblings before, but based on what she knew about the circle of nobility, not even blood-related siblings would treat each other that well, not to mention that she was just an adopted child.Does he have some motive in mind?Such thoughts had come to Alicia more than once. She had also listened to the discussions of the servants, but the conclusion she arrived at was that the only thing he could get from her was this body of hers, which was still passable in looks.Is that it? Is my body what he wants? If that\u2019s the case, I guess it\u2019s all fine then.That was what Alicia, who craved love, thought. She didn\u2019t see any problems with entrusting her body to someone who treated her better than anyone else in the world. Rather, that was the compensation that he rightfully deserved.The young Alicia knew very little about the affairs between men and women and didn\u2019t quite understand what the notion signified, but she was aware of the lack of offspring in the Ascart House. She deemed it her responsibility to the house to bear children for Roel and raise them up.It doesn\u2019t sound too bad?If she could continue staying by his side and enjoy such bliss, she felt that such a trade-off was completely acceptable. After having a taste of the sweet poison known as happiness and affection, she couldn\u2019t bear the thought of returning back to her old days of pain and loneliness anymore.That was why she had resolved to devote herself to Roel and spend everyday in bliss. She thought that these days could go on forever until the end of time.But, old nightmares suddenly caught up. Once again, she found herself faced with the demon, Bron, and he tried to drag her back into the hell that she had barely escaped from. Just as she was about to drown in despair, Roel appeared once more and tore apart the vines entrapping her. He pulled her out from the darkness that was just moments away from engulfing her completely.That night, while Roel remained unconscious after the incident, Alicia insisted on staying by his side. She pondered many things, and before she knew it, a spark of flame had already ignited in her heart. It burned with irrepressible intensity, searing her in both body and mind. She felt like she was going to be set alight.This must be the love that adults speak of.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe previously thought of her feelings for Roel as a fair exchange, a give-and-take relationship. But right now, all she wanted was to give. She felt these sentiments were a manifestation of her love for Roel.Her body, her soul, and her heart, she wanted to offer them all to the person whom she loved the most in the world. She found herself unable to curb these feelings anymore, and that was why she confessed to him.To her relief, she received the response that she expected.This was the moment that Alicia felt the happiest in her lifetime.This should have been enough to satisfy her, but during her conversation with Roel, she couldn\u2019t help but seriously think over some matters, namely the future of the Ascart House.Roel berated her for trying to take on any blame for the incident, but it was a fact that she was the trigger behind the fallout between the Ascart House and the Elric House. She knew that Roel had replaced her as the Elrics\u2019 new target.Alicia had once heard from Carter that Roel\u2019s potential as a transcendent was severely limited. In fact, it was unlikely for him to even obtain an Origin Attribute in the future. The plan had been for him to lie low and expand the Ascart House\u2019s family tree quietly, but it was all in shambles, now that the Elric House was eyeing him.He had inadvertently gotten himself embroiled in the factional rivalries of the Theocracy, thus placing himself right in the face of danger.Even if Roel told her that she didn\u2019t have to pay any heed to it, how could she possibly pretend that nothing had happened at all?The old Alicia might have wept about it when no one was looking, but the current Alicia was going to handle it differently. She, too, had been changed by the incident.From the moment she grabbed hold of the knife, her cowardice and weakness had been washed away. She used to wait for Roel to bring her the happiness she sought, but everything that had happened made her realize that she had to take a more proactive stance. She had to fight in order to steer the future in the direction she wanted and protect what she treasured.Happiness might have come knocking on her door, but she had to reach out and grasp onto it tightly.And, it was not beyond her means to do so.It was not as if there had been no precedence to the circumstances that Roel was faced with. Houses like the Ascarts, from time to time, would find themselves faced with a generation where transcendental powers seemed to have suddenly vanished.There were many ways to deal with this situation. One was to marry more spouses and have many children, but if the house was standing in the face of a powerful enemy, the wiser decision would be to marry a powerful spouse.There were plenty of cases in history where powerful women protected their weaker husbands, and some of them had even been adapted into folktales and made commonplace. Alicia, as someone who possessed a bloodline, even if it was just a non-offensive Copper Bloodline, was able to grow faster as a transcendent than most others, making her suitable for the role.She had already made up her mind to protect Roel no matter what happened.And for that to happen, she needed strength.\u2026Dong dong dong!Standing in a silent corridor, Alicia knocked on the tall study room door.\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me, Lord Father.\u201d\u201cAlicia? Come in.\u201dThe man inside the study was a little surprised to hear Alicia\u2019s voice, and he quickly gave her permission to enter.Alicia pushed the door open and looked at the man sitting behind a wooden desk covered with documents. She got straight to the point.\u201cLord Father, please teach me spells.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCarter was taken aback by Alicia\u2019s sudden request. He stared at the silver-haired girl standing before him in surprise, before the emotions reflected on his face gradually changed.\u201cChild, what is it that you want?\u201d\u201cI wish to protect Lord Brother. For that, I need to become strong.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCarter fell silent after hearing the girl\u2019s reply. A conflicted look surfaced on his face as he struggled internally for a long while before finally speaking in a sobering tone.\u201cAlicia, the road of a transcendent isn\u2019t as smooth-sailing as others think it to be. It\u2019s filled with danger and horrors. Are you certain that you wish to walk on this path for another person?\u201dCarter had cast aside his identity as Roel\u2019s father for the moment. He was asking this question from the standpoint of someone who had walked the same path that Alicia now sought.Alicia looked seriously at Carter in response. The slight tinge of warmth she felt inside thinking about her resolution brought a smile on her face, and she answered determinedly.\u201cYes, Lord Father. There\u2019s nothing in this world that scares me more than the thought of losing big brother Roel. The danger and horrors I face will not knock me down; they\u2019ll only make me stronger.\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dCarter stared at the smiling girl with a dumbfounded look on his face. He thought that he was seeing things.Her back was faced against the abyss, and the path ahead of her was filled with brilliant radiance.O\u2019 great Sia, this child\u2026Carter silently stood up from behind his desk and walked over to Alicia\u2019s side. He squatted down to look her in the eye, and he spoke with words filled with such great conviction that they almost seemed prophetic.\u201cAlicia, you\u2019ll become strong. I promise you that.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - Steam Again!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 50: Steam Again!Yep, looks like it\u2019s time for me to splurge again.Roel thought as he looked at the neat row of boxes filled with gold coins sitting right before him.That\u2019s right, Roel had struck it rich.From yesterday morning, which was the day right after Nora\u2019s birthday banquet, the street outside the Ascart House\u2019s Labyrinth Villa had been filled with carriages. The nobles were fighting with one another to enter this usually feared villa to express their deepest concern for Roel and Alicia.These nobles were neither the subordinates of the Ascart House nor the friends of Carter. All of them had a common similarity though\u2014they were the parents of those in the Elric Youth Faction.The existence of the Elric Youth Faction had been made known along with the incident. While the leader of the group, Bron, had been killed by Count Bryan, the discussion on how they should deal with the rest of the group, who had tyrannized others alongside Bron, was still underway.Not every noble house could be as cold-blooded as the Elric House. Most nobles were willing to pay some price to save their children, and there were even a few who didn\u2019t know of the existence of the Elric Youth Faction. Now that crisis had struck, they were trying everything they could to resolve the problem.They weren\u2019t so foolishly naive as to think that they would be spared just by lying low, especially not after beating up the young master of the Ascart House. If things blew up, the ones to suffer would surely be their own children.Ever since the incident yesterday, the noble houses had been fighting with one another to foot Roel\u2019s medical bill. Of course, given the multitude of distinguished actors amongst the nobles, one could expect a fair dose of drama as well. There were monologues depicting feelings of lamentation over how they had failed to keep their children in line, followed by infuriated vows to break the legs of their children.Roel felt that there was no need for that since he had already broken their \u2018leg\u2019 back then.In any case, the Ascart House chose to accept some of the gifts and money that the noble houses brought over. They also expressed their willingness to reconcile with some of the sidelined houses in the Elric House\u2019s faction.It was not that the Ascart House was bowing down to them, but that it was an essential political maneuver.These noble houses used to side themselves with the Elric House, but now that the Elric House had lost a son and fell into disrepute, it was an ideal opportunity to poach their people.The Xeclydes and the Ascarts had already discussed their plans to divide and undermine the Elric House\u2019s influence. Roel\u2019s unintentional fight had really brought them the impetus they needed in order to stage the collapse of the Elric House\u2019s influence.Regarding the gifts, Carter magnanimously handed them off to Roel and Alicia, citing the reason that they were the victims and ought to be compensated.Roel was more than delighted with his father\u2019s decision. He had figured that the whole lot would be confiscated and funneled into the Ascart House\u2019s public funds, so it was a pleasant surprise that things turned out this way instead. One should know, of the five elements, the one he lacked the most was none other than gold.After all, the System was practically a gold digger!And just yesterday, Roel noticed that the System was holding yet another event.\u3010Special Event: Inaugural War of FuryIn a dark room, amidst flashes of cold blades, you stand determined to protect the justice in your heart.Everything in the event shop currently going for 30% off!\u3011\u3010Special Event: Silver Wings of LiberationRelease the silver bird from its cage. Allow it to unfurl its wings and fly to unstoppable heights!The items in the event shop will be discounted by 40% (Can be stacked with other discounts)\u3011To be honest, Roel initially thought nothing about the 30% discount, but when he saw that the second special event was an additional, stackable 40% discount, he suddenly felt electricity running through his body as he jolted upright.A 30% discount on top of a 40% discount\u2026 That was a grand total of 58% off!One must know that even the usual monthly sales only gave a 50% discount!Goddamnit! Shopkeeper, get me everything from this row to that row!Roel quickly went into the event shop to take a look, and voila! It was yet another surprise! There were surprisingly a lot more items inside the event shop than usual. He would typically only receive 2 items in the event shop every month, but there were 10 items this time around!However, because this was a special event, the items would only remain in the shop for a week. Nevertheless, this didn\u2019t dampen Roel\u2019s mood at all for he was now a mini tycoon!In order to fish their offspring out of this massive scandal, the noble houses really went all out. The amount that was received from each house ranged from several hundred to several thousand. All in all, the split that Roel obtained in total was around a hulking 10,000 gold coins!And, that wasn\u2019t all.An old friend had come to visit him during this period\u2014Arwen.It had been several months since Arwen had been appointed as manager of the Saint Mesit Theocracy Headquarters. As soon as he caught wind of the matters that had transpired during the princess\u2019 birthday, he immediately tapped into the Sorofyas\u2019 information network to uncover the details surrounding the matter before hurriedly rushing over to pay Roel a visit with all sorts of recovery medicine, tonics, and, not to forget, gold coins.Arwen wasn\u2019t just indebted to Roel over the issue surrounding the Soulcalming Lamp. More than that, Roel was going to be his future collaboration partner. If something were to happen to the Ascart House, Arwen would be losing out on a lot of potential profits.Of course, his action of siding with the Ascart House would risk placing him on the bad side of the Elric House\u2026\u2026 but who cares? I\u2019m a Rosaian anyway. The only superior I\u2019m accountable to is the Sorofyas. The Elrics can hate me for all they want, but they can\u2019t do anything about me.Roel got up from his bed to welcome Arwen in person. Two acquaintances meeting in a foreign land tended to evoke feelings of closeness. The two of them chatted leisurely in the reception room, bringing their ties closer, though Roel did manage to get some useful information out of the conversation too.\u201cThe Elric House? Ah\u2026 Young master Roel, you should also be aware that us employees of the Sorofyas are bound by a clause of confidentiality.\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m aware, but surely you must also know of some information that isn\u2019t confidential? Tell me anything that you are allowed to concerning the Elric House.\u201d\u201cThe Elric House, huh? Hmmm, let me give it some thoughts\u2026\u201dArwen pondered with a frown for a long while before he finally spoke up slowly.\u201cThe current Elric House is a little\u2026 unusual.\u201d\u201cOh? What do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cThere are some doubts surrounding how the Elric House managed to rise to power once more. Young master Roel, you have heard of the battle between the royal twins a hundred years ago, right?\u201d\u201cNaturally. It\u2019s a matter concerning my predecessor, Ponte. I have known about it since I was young.\u201dRoel spoke with a straight face without the slightest hint of embarrassment on it.Arwen nodded his head before he continued on.\u201cThe battle between the royal twins led to the Elric House being banished to the borders facing the Austine Empire and Knight Kingdom Pendor. I have once traveled to the borders myself, and I can assure you that it\u2019s not an easy land to manage. It\u2019s a buffer zone between the three countries, and small skirmishes often occur there. It\u2019s a place of chaos.\u201cThe intention behind the royal family\u2019s decision to banish the Elric House there is likely to have it spiral into decline before vanishing from the face of the world. However, after struggling for the past hundred years, the Elric House miraculously managed to rise back to power. What is bizarre about this whole matter though is that the Elric House\u2019s rise is totally unaccounted for. Our Sorofyas actually didn\u2019t notice it until it had already happened.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201dRoel was confused, so Arwen took some time to reorganize his words before he elaborated with a much softer voice.\u201cYoung master Roel, our Sorofyas is a merchant organization. We have invested significantly to build up our intelligence network, so as to ensure that we can make the right decisions. Ah, just to clarify, we don\u2019t engage in spy work or espionage! We would never stoop that low! What we mainly do is collating and tabulating information.\u201d\u201cCollating and tabulating information? Wait, what you mean to say is that\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, we gather information and make estimates about each fief\u2019s production and flow of goods. Through this, we are able to gauge each noble house\u2019s financial power and make investments accordingly. However, our investigations seem to have failed with the Elric House.\u201dSpeaking up to this point, an uncomprehending look appeared on Arwen\u2019s face.\u201cBased on the data we have gathered on the Elric House\u2019s fiefdom, there hasn\u2019t been any change in their population size over the past few decades.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - Bridal StudiesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 51: Bridal StudiesWhat is the foundation of a noble house\u2019s rise to greatness?There were many answers to this question, but if one really had to choose an answer, it would undoubtedly be wise governance. How well a fiefdom fared would directly affect a noble house\u2019s base of power.A noble house could be blessed with talented offspring, but it would be futile if it had no money to hire the best instructors to nurture their talents. Building connections with other nobles also required money, be it purchasing dresses or keeping up appearances. Even a powerful army had to be maintained atop a pile of money.All of this was financed by the taxes earned by the fiefdom, which was in turn related to the workforce.If the governance is inept, the standard of living of the people will fall, reducing productivity. If the governance is tyrannical, the people will migrate to other lands. If the governance is excellent, foreign talent will consider settling down in the fiefdom.It was with such considerations that the Sorofyas used the growth of population as one of the indicators to measure how qualified a lord was.But how could the Sorofyas measure a fiefdom\u2019s population? After all, it couldn\u2019t possibly do a headcount of every single person in a territory. How inefficient would that be?The Sorofyas\u2019 approach toward this matter was to make an estimation through the flow of goods of one of the necessities in everyday life\u2014salt.Humans cannot live without salt; this was a physiological need. This was especially so in this era of menial labor. Those who under consume salt would find themselves feeling lethargic and lacking in strength.\u201cThe Elric Fiefdom doesn\u2019t produce salt, which means that they have to acquire all of it through merchants. As such, we\u2019re confident about the accuracy of the figures we have. Any discrepancy in the results should be minimal. In our analysis, we found that the amount of salt bought by the Elric Fiefdom has been going up slowly over the past few decades, similar to some of the more stable fiefdoms around.\u201cWhile it does show that the Elric Fiefdom has been governed decently, it also shows that there\u2019s nothing spectacularly outstanding about it. To put it bluntly, it\u2019s average. It\u2019s doing neither good nor bad. From this result, our inference is that the Elric House should also be faring ordinarily, neither prospering nor in decline. But the truth is that\u2026\u201d\u201cThe truth is that the Elric House has been rising with great momentum over the past few decades, making it one of the higher ranking houses in the Five Eminent Noble Houses. Its influence in the Theocracy\u2019s circle of nobility has grown tremendously, perhaps even surpassing that of the Ascart House. Things are going very differently from what the Sorofya Merchant Association predicted.\u201dRoel finished the sentence for Arwen.\u201cYes, that\u2019s why I said that there\u2019s something weird about this.\u201dArwen revealed a look of incomprehension, whereas Roel fell silent.\u201cIf a noble house wishes to rise through the ranks, the one thing that they absolutely need is money. Given that the Elric Fiefdom hasn\u2019t picked up much over the years, where could they have possibly obtained their money from? While the Elric House has been blessed with transcendents over the past few generations, they don\u2019t appear to have uncovered any lucrative trade to finance their activities. Yet, despite them keeping a low profile all this while, it\u2019s a fact that the influence has been continuously growing.\u201cIn any case, young master Roel, I think that you ought to tread carefully.\u201dArwen offered Roel a piece of advice with a rare grave look on his face, and the latter nodded in response.\u201cI\u2019m thankful for your reminder, Mister Arwen. I\u2019ll pay heed to that. Other than these, is there anything else that you can think of?\u201d\u201cAh. I have only read the internal reports thus far. Why don\u2019t I do this instead? I\u2019ll head back to flip through the records we have on the Elric House. Perhaps, I might be able to find something new.\u201d\u201cThat would be wonderful! I\u2019ll compensate you appropriately for the information.\u201d\u201cHahaha, there\u2019s no need for that. As long as you drop by from time to time to unload some of the stuff that is jamming up your vault, I think I\u2019ll be able to laugh even in my sleep.\u201dThose words from the middle-aged man brought a bitter smile to Roel\u2019s face. He felt that he should really get some stuff from the Affection Points Exchange Shop to sell to him now.The two of them chatted for a little longer before Arwen took his leave.After that, Roel looked for Carter to gather more information about the Elric House. Unexpectedly, Carter simply threw him a detailed investigation report to browse through. Once again, his understanding of his own house underwent a forceful refresh.As he had spent his life living in a posh mansion filled with servants, he hadn\u2019t been able to catch a glimpse into the military prowess of the Ascart House thus far, but it would appear that it was really a huge deal in the Theocracy. On top of owning a reserve army, it had the power to swiftly rally 3000 Origin Level 6 soldiers through the militia forces too. Aside from that, the intelligence network that it managed was the top amongst the Five Eminent Noble Houses.The Five Eminent Noble Houses were like independent kingdoms, operating in a manner similar to a standard decentralized governance structure in the Middle Ages. The Xeclydes wielded absolute influence, due to their tight reins over the faith of the populace, and anyone who tried to challenge their authority would be swiftly knocked back in place. As such, it was the leader of the pack.In truth, the Xeclydes\u2019 duty as the royal family was, to put it simply, serve as the mediator in the conflicts between nobles.Meanwhile, the Elric House was the little tyrant right beneath the royal family, standing high and mighty before the others. It was just that it took the wrong side in the conflict a hundred years ago.Speaking of fights between nobles, there was one implicit rule that governed it:No familicide.Nobles were graceful, even in battles. If they couldn\u2019t win a battle, they could surrender and redeem themselves with money. The victor was obliged to leave the losing house\u2019s lineage intact. Unless in extreme conditions, rooting out an entire family was a forbidden course of action.It could be thought of as a contractual agreement that nobles sign upon birth. The goal behind this implicit rule was to preserve the lineage of nobles. Anyone who tried to undermine this rule would be sanctioned by other nobles.This could be seen from the battle between the two royal twins back then. The Elrics and the mighty army of 10,000 they commanded had indeed chosen to stand with Prince Wade, but this action was not considered a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. As such, the limit of what the royal family could do was to evict them to the border.Another implicit rule amongst the nobles was to respect the chain of command. The royal family, as the highest leader, had the authority to command the Five Eminent Noble Houses and the nobles directly under their command; there was no question about its legitimacy to do so.However, if it overstepped its boundaries and attempted to touch the viscounts subordinated to the Elric House, it would be viewed as an act of undermining the dignity of the Elric House. Such an action would bring about condemnation from the other nobles.The Five Eminent Noble Houses needed a \u2018big brother\u2019 to help resolve conflicts and maintain harmony amongst them, but if the \u2018big brother\u2019 threatened their authority and power, they would be incentivized to turn their swords against the \u2018big brother\u2019 and seek a new liege.For this reason, nobles knew very little about each other\u2019s military power.According to the Ascart House\u2019s report, the Elric House had been expanding its army slowly over the years. This wasn\u2019t much of an issue as their population was growing as well, so it was only natural that they needed more people to maintain security.However, what was interesting was that the number of mercenaries it employed had increased significantly over the years.The Elric Fiefdom was located at the intersection of three major countries with several other minor countries in the region, making it an ideal place for mercenaries to earn a quick buck. There was nothing wrong with a fiefdom to hire mercenaries to bolster its forces, but it was often viewed as a last resort due to a major risk associated with it:Can you really differentiate which ones are the real mercenaries?The report only contained a preliminary estimate regarding the number of mercenaries the Elrics had employed; there was no way of getting a concrete number on that.But in any case, the report had raised Roel\u2019s guard toward the Elric House.The feelings he had when he looked at the System\u2019s discounts once more were completely different from before. The bizarre circumstances surrounding the rise of the Elric House had left him with an ominous vibe. His goal was no longer just raising his fighting prowess anymore; more than that, it was a way of self-protection.The goal that Roel\u2019s eyes were set upon all this while was very clear:Self-preservation. After all, he only had one life to live.With this goal in mind, Roel took another look at the discounted items in the event shop, and there was one thing that immediately stood out to him.\u3010Calamity of BloodshedA failed spell from the noble research of the Doujutsu Society. There\u2019s a chance that a person who carries killing intent toward you will have his name revealed amidst crimson light to you. Remember, don\u2019t waste your time screaming for theatrical effects. Just run!Price: 4200 Gold Coins\u30114200 gold coins.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn other words, the item cost 10,000 gold coins prior to the discount. It was pretty expensive for a spell. But again, you get what you pay for. Its effects were pretty useful, especially since it appeared that there were no bothersome prerequisites to activate the skill.The only gripe that Roel had with it was the idea that it was dependent on chance. He had no idea how high this chance was, which meant that he couldn\u2019t fully rely on it. Aside from that, it seemed like it would only work if he were to see the target in person. In other words, he couldn\u2019t rely on it to avoid secret arrows aimed at him or sudden assassination attempts.But even with these restrictions in place, it was still a useful spell. It could very well save his life in the future.Roel was indeed tempted to buy the Calamity of Bloodshed since he was certain that it would be useful. Being able to confirm who was an enemy would definitely prove to be a valuable asset in protecting himself. The only issue was that\u2026\u2026 4200 gold coins was still too expensive!He would have to find a way to borrow a bit of money, and as for whom he should borrow it from\u2026\u2026\u201cAlicia. If you have no use for the compensation you have received yet, can I borrow some of it for a while?\u201dInside a room, Roel tried to suppress his embarrassment as he asked the silver-haired girl for money. Alicia blinked her eyes at Roel for a moment before nodding her head lightly.\u201cSure, Lord Brother. If you have a need for it, you can take it all.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m just borrowing it for the time being. I\u2019ll return it to you once we get back home,\u201d clarified Roel with a quick wave of his hand.Roel did have quite a bit of money left from the sales of the Soulcalming Lamp, but he had left it back at the old mansion in Ascart City. He wouldn\u2019t be able to reach it before the discounts ended since there were still some things they had to attend to in the Holy Capital.But surprisingly, Alicia didn\u2019t seem too bothered with Roel\u2019s guarantee. She simply responded with a casual nod, clearly thinking nothing of it at all.\u201c\u2026\u201dRoel sensed that Alicia seemed to have no notion of just how important money was, and as an older brother, he felt obliged to say something about it.\u201cAlicia, I know that we don\u2019t have much use for money, as most of our needs are paid for by the Ascart House. However, you should still try to build up your own savings. You do have things that you want, right?\u201d\u201cThings that I want\u2026\u201dThe silver-haired girl repeated contemplatively as she stared at Roel in a daze. This left Roel feeling a little perplexed.\u201cAlicia?\u201d\u201cAH!\u201d\u201cHm? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cN-nothing! Lord Brother, I don\u2019t have anything I want at the moment, so please feel free to take my share of the compensation for your use,\u201d said Alicia with a reddened face.She quickly stood up and curtsied lightly to Roel.\u201cLord Brother, I\u2019ll be heading off to study. I\u2019ll come over to find you a little later.\u201d\u201cAh, I see\u2026 Alicia, you need not push yourself too hard in your studies. You can always catch up with your lessons after we return to Ascart City.\u201dTo be honest, Roel couldn\u2019t understand why Alicia was so determined in her studies. Kids her age should be trying to skip lessons wherever possible! To persist in her studies despite having traveled all the way to Holy Capital Loren, this was already beyond the normal scope of diligence!Alicia didn\u2019t bother to clarify Roel\u2019s misunderstanding. Instead, she smiled quietly to herself for a moment before finally replying tenderly.\u201cIt\u2019s bridal studies.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That being said, there were still a few events that cut exceptionally deep into one\u2019s heart, like one\u2019s father remarrying, or having to marry off one\u2019s adopted sister.Roel was only ten this year, but he had been through the vicissitudes of life. He had experienced the beauty of modern society, as well as the extravagant life of a noble in an era of feudalism. Despite his appearance as a cute little boy, he already had the mentality of a forty-year-old father.Thus, when he heard that Alicia was going to do \u2018bridal studies\u2019, he was utterly floored. He had actually forgotten that such a day would come when Alicia would have to be married off.Roel was no longer living in the modern era anymore. This was a world plagued with disease and war, where most countries would never reach their optimum population. In response, countries naturally encouraged more childbirth. The Theocracy, as the moral compass of human society, had many teachings encouraging childbirth too.Due to this, the people in this world tended to marry at a young age, similar to how it was in the Middle Ages in Roel\u2019s previous world. It was perfectly normal for girls of 14 or 15 years to be mothers. It was common for nobles to take it slightly slower, but most noblewomen still married and gave birth by 17 or 18. Any woman who remained single beyond 20 would be considered a spinster, or using a more common term in Roel\u2019s previous world, an old maid.Of course, this standard only applied to ordinary people; transcendents followed another set of rules. Transcendents would undergo some physical changes due to the assimilation of mana. This would result in their lifespan increasing or decreasing to some degree, so it depended on context. Nevertheless, most nobles were already grandparents by the time they were in their fifties.In this world, childbirth was viewed as a blessing rather than a burden. An additional person in the household meant an additional pair of hands to help out. Furthermore, the more children one had, the more likely the chances of drawing a SSR.This was especially so for noble houses. The older a noble house was, the fewer offspring they tended to have. If a noble house were to usher in a patriarch who was exceptionally good at \u2018sowing seeds\u2019, even the ancestors would leap out from their graves to offer praise to the great Sia above!It was not to say that old noble houses were lacking inthataspect. Instead, the problem stemmed from the rules governing the circle of nobility.To put it simply, there was no freedom to love amongst nobles. Marriages were decided by one\u2019s parents, and they were used as political tools to consolidate power.More often than not, nobles would only meet their betrothed partners once at a ball and, perhaps, have a dance together before suddenly marrying one another. For the couples, it was almost like drawing a lottery. If the couple surprisingly clicked with one another, it would be all for the best, but it was unfortunate that such lucky ones were rare.The reality for most high society marriages was that they are barely being held together by a thread known as duty. There were even some couples with completely fractured relationships.Given so, how high could the birth rate possibly be?What Roel was most worried about now was Carter embroiling the young Alicia in a loveless political marriage.Alicia was going to be eight this year. Going by conventions, they should have already decided on a fianc\u00e9 for her. In fact, Carter\u2019s aim in adopting her was to elevate her standing, so as to find a good husband for her. If she was going to start her \u2018bridal studies\u2019 now, could it be that there was some progress regarding this matter?Roel was deeply worried that Alicia and her future husband wouldn\u2019t get along with one another. Just thinking about it made him fidget uneasily.How can I give Alicia away to someone else? No way in hell! I haven\u2019t gotten enough of stroking\u2026 Cough! Where else am I going to get my Affection Points from then? Besides, who is she even going to be betrothed to?Roel struck his bed with his fist as he gritted his teeth in anger.No, definitely not! It would be like sending a lamb into the mouth of a tiger if we were to betroth Alicia to those arrogant young masters! Besides, there are no good people amongst those noble rascals\u2026 except for me, of course!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euRoel righteously denounced the depraved nobles of the world while distancing himself from them. Once again, he affirmed his will to keep Alicia by his side, and he vowed to use all means possible to oppose Alicia\u2019s marriage.\u201cEy? Wait wait wait wait wait! Aren\u2019t I in the same position too? Isn\u2019t it possible for me to get into a political marriage too?\u201dThis notion stopped Roel briefly and caused him to ponder his own situation, but a moment later, he burst into laughter.\u201cAhahahaha, how can that be possible? How could I possibly not know if I was already in an arranged marriage?\u201dWhile Roel was carefully considering how he could keep Alicia in the Ascart House, a carriage bearing the insignia of the Guardian of Radiant Wings came to a halt at the entrance of the Labyrinth Villa.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201cWhy does your face stiffen whenever you meet me? Just what have I done to incur your displeasure?\u201dIn one of the villa\u2019s guest rooms, Nora greeted Roel with a bright smile while making an apt remark about his stiff fake smile. Roel, who was just smiling for the sake of maintaining a basic level of civility, quickly wiped the forced smile off before responding.\u201cIt\u2019s all a misunderstanding. You are the one and only princess of the Saint Mesit Theocracy, an exalted existence. There are many who would queue up just to catch a glimpse of your glory. It\u2019s my deepest honor to welcome you into our humble abode.\u201dLeaning into his sofa, Roel once again spoke words that sounded like they had come straight out of a textbook. It was a replica of the polite yet distant attitude Alicia had shown him back when they first met.Nora pondered this response for a moment before trying a new maneuver. She replied with a downtrodden tone.\u201cI thought that we would have become close after I saved you, but it looks like it was all one-sided thinking on my part.\u201dNora\u2019s eyes drooped down and the graceful smile she usually plastered on her face withered a little. Her eyes reflected dejection and helplessness, and she gave off an air of misery that would evoke pity from all beholders. It was an appearance no one would have expected from the confident princess, almost feeling as if anyone who had tried to hurt her, whether in word or deed, were grave sinners who should be condemned to the lowest depths of hell.\u201c\u2026\u201dYou win, alright? Can you stop acting like this?Roel felt his head hurt a little as he looked at Nora. Looking back, she had indeed saved his life. If not for her stalling Bron\u2019s allies for a good two minutes, he might have ended up with a couple more fractured bones or worse.Reciprocation was in order. It would appear immature on his part to continue treating her so coldly after benefiting from her assistance.\u201cNora, thank you for your help.\u201d(Affection Points +100!)Roel squeezed out his words of gratitude with great difficulty, and fortunately, Nora swiftly reverted back to normal after hearing them. She gracefully walked over to a chair and sat down.\u201cI was the one who saved you for that incident, but considering the overall outcome, I feel like I should be the one thanking you instead.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cAs the young princess of the Theocracy, it\u2019s my responsibility to rally the young nobles under my banner. However, I\u2019m rarely in the Holy Capital, and I devote far too much time to my knight training. The influence I command has diminished without me noticing. That gave the Elrics an opportunity to stick their heads in and form their Elric Youth Faction. Basically, it\u2019s my negligence that resulted in this situation.\u201dNora confessed, and her open and honest attitude in admitting her faults left Roel feeling a bit more respect for her.As the saying went, \u2018if my liege treats me with sincerity, I shall repay him with loyalty\u2019. While Roel didn\u2019t consider himself as her subject, her earnest attitude still stirred some changes in him.I guess it\u2019s fine not to put that much distance between us.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In truth, it should have been the three of them\u2014Nora, Bron, and Roel\u2014forming three separate factions to lead the youths, but due to the negligence of two of the parties, as well the Elrics\u2019 intentional scheming, it eventually led to the rise of the Elric Youth Faction.Having thought through this matter, he began to counsel Nora.\u201cI do have a part to play in this matter too.

He waited for two whole seconds before he turned to direct a puzzled look at Nora.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why aren\u2019t you responding?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing much. I\u2019m just a little surprised. I didn\u2019t think that you would console me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m just speaking the truth.\u201dNora\u2019s sapphire eyes stared deeply into Roel\u2019s golden ones as she tried to peer through the inner thoughts in his mind. There was always an indescribable contradiction behind Roel\u2019s actions. His actions and behaviors showed that he carried no ill-will for her. In fact, she believed that he had a high opinion of her. Yet, for some reason, there seemed to be an inexplicable distance separating the two of them.What is the reason behind this?As Little Miss Angel pondered over this question, she suddenly seemed to have found yet another spark of joy in Roel.(Affection Points +100!)\u201cBy the way, where\u2019s Alicia? I thought that she would have accompanied you. Is she resting?\u201dNora casually glanced around the room as she dropped this question, only to be surprised by Roel\u2019s silence. It took a while before the latter finally squeezed out a bitter response.\u201cAlicia is currently taking home economics classes. I didn\u2019t ask her for details. Ha. Haha.\u201dThinking about the \u2018bridal studies\u2019 that Alicia was currently going through, Roel let out a series of strained laughter. That brought a doubtful look to Nora\u2019s face. Even from the perspective of an outsider, she could tell that Alicia was very fond of Roel, so it didn\u2019t seem likely that she would choose her lessons over accompanying him.Wait a moment. Now that I think of it, while I was walking through the foyer earlier, I noticed a series of sparks of magic spells coming from the southwest room\u2026 I see. Is she practicing?Comprehension flickered across Nora\u2019s eyes. She took a look at the forlorn Roel sitting before her and, after some thought, eventually shook her head.Forget it. It\u2019ll be better for the person-in-question to explain it herself. It\u2019s bad manners to interfere in the relations of others. Besides, it\u2019s not to my advantage either\u2026Nora shot Roel with the sharp look of an eagle eyeing its prey, but she immediately concealed it.This is bad. It\u2019s still too early to reveal my true desires to him.Ahhh, I really want to step on him and see him pleading for mercy. Is this the feeling that criminals feel before sinning?Nora looked at Roel, who seemed to be getting warier and warier after noticing her gaze, and she wondered if he was an incubus sent from the devils of hell to tempt her into depravity. Or could this be Sia\u2019s trial for her? Whenever her eyes fell upon Roel, her desire to bully him would grip her thoughts hard.\u201cYou really are a danger to me.\u201d\u201cW-what?\u201dNoticing that the nature of the gaze the blushing Nora was directing toward him was becoming weirder and weirder, Roel panicked. He was still recuperating from his injuries, and Nora was an entire level stronger than him. If she were to succumb to her sadistic tendencies, he would be completely helpless to stop her.\u201cYour Highness Nora, please! Take a deep breath and control yourself. Haven\u2019t you gotten through fine thus far? I believe that you can overcome your own desires, so you should believe in yourself too!\u201d\u201cYou dare say such words when you are the one seducing me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHow in the world am I seducing you? Tell me, I\u2019ll change!Roel\u2019s face puffed-up red with fury, but his reaction only seemed to deepen the depravity lurking in Nora\u2019s eyes. She leaned in and placed her hand softly on the boy\u2019s chest, speaking in a sensual, deep tone.\u201cHave you considered what I told you?\u201d\u201cW-what?\u201dNora\u2019s abrupt touch made Roel stiffen up, and his reply was equally stiff. Nora giggled softly at his reaction.\u201cBecoming mine, of course. What do you think about becoming my subordinate and spending every day with me?\u201d\u201cHahaha, you sure know how to jest. I have to take over the Ascart House too, you know.\u201d\u201cIs there any conflict between the two? Uncle Carter is a marquess, but he\u2019s the vice commander of the Holy Knight Order too.\u201d\u201cMy father is a strong and competent man, so he\u2019s able to juggle those two responsibilities. I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m incapable of managing that. You are also aware that I\u2019m lacking as a transcendent. There\u2019s a good chance that I\u2019ll never be able to reach Origin Level 5 in my lifetime.\u201c\u2026 An army doesn\u2019t just consist of soldiers who fight. Many of our advisors aren\u2019t powerful transcendents too.\u201dNora proposed another possible path that Roel could take in the army, but Roel had no intention of having any deeper ties with her than he already had. He would rather return to the fiefdom and become a farmer instead.\u201cMy apologies, but I refuse. It\u2019s too dangerous for me.\u201d\u201cWhat an obstinate person you are. Sometimes, I really can\u2019t understand why you keep trying to push me away. Our paths are bound to intersect with our backgrounds. Before our common enemy, the Elrics, don\u2019t you think that it\u2019s best for both of our houses if we get more intimate with one another?\u201d\u201cMy deepest apologies, but I feel nothing for you. Your Highness Nora, why don\u2019t you pick someone else instead?\u201d\u201cYou console me when I\u2019m feeling down, yet you claim that you don\u2019t want to get closer to me?\u201d\u201cT-that is\u2026\u201dRoel stuttered on his words as he found himself unable to justify the action he made on a whim earlier. Seeing this, a seductive smile surfaced on Nora\u2019s seemingly pure face. She narrowed her eyes mischievously, enjoying this situation very much.\u201cYour inner conflict amuses me. Don\u2019t you think that we are very similar to one another?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re trying to hold yourself back from getting close to me, and I\u2019m trying to suppress my desires so as not to approach you. It\u2019s the same inner conflict that we both face. It\u2019s almost like a competition to see who drowns first.\u201dNora\u2019s words made Roel widen his eyes. He tried to look into his heart to see how it was that he truly felt, and it finally dawned on him.To him, Nora wasn\u2019t just a beautiful princess, the lofty high flower that none could approach. More than that, she represented hope.Humans would face all sorts of trouble during their lifetime. From time to time, they would feel an inclination to seek help and be protected by others. To Roel, the death flags had been a towering mountain that he struggled to surmount, such that he dared not rest at all. In the process of plucking out his death flags, it was inevitable that he would feel exhausted and want to give up.And Nora seemed to be a quick solution to the problems he was facing.She had the power, money, and influence to protect him. If he was willing to give up his independence for survival, going along with Nora would have been a very feasible course of action. She was a sadist\u2014no doubt about that\u2014but she was someone who knew how to treat those whom she cared for very well. In the game, she was known to be an excellent leader.But even so, Roel was someone who believed in seizing fate with his own hands. He didn\u2019t want to give up his initiative to take on a more passive role. He felt that he would stand to lose many things if he chose this option. It could be his fiefdom, his fortune, or maybe the people who he cared about; he didn\u2019t know exactly which it would be, but he didn\u2019t want to risk it.After a long bout of contemplation, Roel finally revealed his decision.\u201cDrown? Sorry to disappoint you, but I choose to remain afloat.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Who knows, it might lead you to happiness.\u201dRoel shook his head in response to Nora\u2019s efforts to tempt him.\u201cPerhaps so, but there are many different types of happiness in this world. The happiness I wish for is one that I grasp hold of myself. Happiness bestowed might be convenient, but it\u2019s easily lost too.\u201d\u201cYou know that I\u2019m not that kind of person.\u201d\u201c\u2026 There are always circumstances where a person is forced to make a choice.\u201d\u201cHmm, what you said makes sense too\u2026 Looks like I\u2019ve failed to tempt you once again. You really know how to crush my confidence.\u201dNora straightened her body upward as she sighed softly, revealing the expression of a child throwing a tantrum at not having obtained a new toy, but soon, her lips curled up once more.\u201cWhile you have rejected me, I must say that the reason you have given me is quite satisfactory.\u201d\u201cThanks for the compliment. Speaking of which\u2026 did you come all the way here just to tell me these things?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it. I\u2019m here to deliver a gift to you. You can think of it as a token of gratitude from the royal family.\u201d\u201cA token of gratitude?\u201dYou are giving me a gift for fighting on your birthday? Dear goodness, are you an angel? Oh wait, you are\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euRoel thought as Nora turned around to take out a gift box.\u201cShall I open it? Or would you prefer to do it yourself?\u201d\u201cYou can open it.\u201dRoel looked at the long wooden box in Nora\u2019s hand. It was a black box crafted out of resilient black ironwood. It typically wouldn\u2019t be used as a gift box because it was too heavy.The toughness of black ironwood was comparable to steel, but its density surpassed it. Even though Nora was able to hold it easily with a single hand, an ordinary human would probably struggle to carry it even with both.Just what in the world could it be?Nora smiled. Before Roel\u2019s expectant eyes, she lightly pulled away the ribbon wrapped around the heavy wooden box before prying it open. Roel immediately saw a sharp flash of light burst forth, causing his eyes to hurt a little.Unable to withhold his curiosity, he stood up and walked closer to take a look.The exterior of the box looked humble, but its interior was surprisingly magnificent. There was a painting at the center of the box, depicting an angel standing with closed eyes, emanating holy light. There were armed men gathered around the angel as they faced the darkness surrounding them.Yeap, it was likely to be some sort of mythical painting, but Roel couldn\u2019t recall what the story behind it was on the spot. That was not important anyway. What was important right now was the metallic item wrapped amidst a white silk cloth sitting inside the box.\u201cThis is a\u2026 short sword? Wait a moment, could this be\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s Saint\u2019s Blade\u2014Twelve Wings, Ascendwing.\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dA smiling Nora calmly revealed the name of the black short sword nestled within the box. This revelation left Roel gobsmacked and frozen in place.Saint\u2019s Blade\u2014Twelve Wings. Roel couldn\u2019t be blamed for gawking like a bumpkin, for this weapon was simply too well-known. If he had to draw a comparison to his previous world, it could be considered his previous world\u2019s Lance of Longinus.While the overall commander-in-chief of the Genesis Goddess Church was Goddess Sia, the ones who made decisions were the angels. There was a verse concerning the blade in the Edda Poems, which originated from a time several millenniums ago, during the lost era. Humans of that period still lacked the ability to record events in writing and could only pass down history orally in hymns and poems.The verse went like this,Man didst discover the lake and encountered the Death Moon therein. Darkness and corrosion chased them from behind, sweeping fear and panic through the believer\u2019s ranks. Falling into madness, they tore their brethren apart with hands and teeth. The holy disciple didst beseech the heavens for succor, and in light and flames, an answer was proclaimed. Twelve wings of incandescence descendeth from the sky to fall before the feet of the holy disciple; twelve wings turned dark as they settled upon the earth. The holy disciple raised them up and roared, and the bloodied claws retreated at last.It was a very dark fairy tale that sounded ridiculous and bizarre to those living in the current era, but this was indeed what that had been passed down.Scholars and theologians had never come to an agreement on the poem\u2019s meaning, but the majority of people believed that the twelve angel wings were weapons. Many humans over the years had tried to trace the epic through the vague details depicted, hoping to uncover the truth. One of the most famous stories surrounding that came from the Ancient Austine Empire.Legend had it that over a thousand years ago, the vast Ancient Austine Empire obtained twelve weapons that resembled feathers. The emperor back then bestowed them to the nobles. However, the Spirit Cataclysm of the Capital occurred, and humans were forced to migrate to the west. The empire fell apart, and the twelve weapons disappeared in the annals of history.There were rumors that the Saint Mesit Theocracy had five of them in its possession, and they were bestowed upon the first generation patriarchs of the Five Eminent Noble Houses, who had made great contributions to the founding of the country. However, after the five patriarchs died, the holy weapons were recollected by the Xeclydes, and they were rarely seen since then.The last time one appeared in public was more than a hundred years ago, in Ponte Ascart\u2019s generation. Back then, after the battle of the royal twins concluded, the Xeclydes bestowed Ponte with one of the Twelve Wings out of gratitude for his contributions and conferred him the title of a \u2018Holy Disciple\u2019. But ever since then, none of the Twelve Wings had been seen again.\u201cYou\u2019re giving it to me?\u201dRoel pointed at the box in Nora\u2019s hands as he shared his doubts. Wasn\u2019t this a gift of the highest honor, given only to those who had saved the Theocracy from a major crisis? Even though he had managed to unearth a massive underlying problem threatening the Theocracy, no matter how he looked at it, he still wasn\u2019t worthy of receiving something as valuable as this.Were the Xeclydes too rich and sought to squander their money? Or was this some sort of bribe?Faced with Roel\u2019s question, Nora chuckled softly and replied.\u201cOf course we can\u2019t give it to you directly. You would have to be conferred as a Holy Disciple first. Your qualifications and age don\u2019t meet the requirement, so we can only temporarily lend it to you, or more specifically, to the Ascart House.\u201dNora\u2019s words helped Roel make sense of what was going on.To put it in simpler terms, the Xeclydes were very worried that Roel would suddenly drop dead.Since their house was working hand-in-hand with the Ascarts to weaken the Elrics, and this internal battle was currently happening in the shadows, it was unlikely that it would elevate into a direct clash. However, this was under the assumption that the enemy would obey the \u2018implicit rules\u2019.Count Bryan had just lost his son, so it was not unthinkable for him to want to exact vengeance. Considering that the Ascart House only had a single successor, there was nothing that would hurt it more than assassinating Roel. Count Bryan definitely had the motive to hurt Roel, and the rewards were great if he succeeded.In order to avoid any mishaps from occurring, the Xeclydes decided to lend a holy weapon to Roel, so that he would be in a safer position.Having finally understood the situation, Roel nodded quietly in acknowledgment before he pointed to the black short sword in the box and asked.\u201cSo, how is this item supposed to be used?\u201dNora\u2019s lips curled up. She tucked her hair seductively to the side as she replied.\u201cIt\u2019s quite simple. You just have to connect your bloodline with mine.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Don\u2019t worry, I know that you don\u2019t have any experience in this, so you can just follow my lead.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat the heck is going on here? Experience? Follow her lead? Why does it sound so\u2026 Cough cough.Roel looked at the golden-haired girl who was staring back at him with an intense look in her eyes, and his face unknowingly began to redden. Nora persisted in her straight face for a little longer before she finally couldn\u2019t hold it anymore and burst into laughter.\u201cHahaha, you really are quite cute at times! Don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t hurt.\u201dNo wait, if anyone is going to be in pain, it should be you\u2026?Nora was unaware that her unintentional words had made the highly knowledgeable Roel\u2019s thoughts wander into a mosaiced domain. She simply thought that the latter was afraid. She reached her hand outward to grab Roel\u2019s palm before laying both of their hands onto the short sword. With a light nick on the blade, blood flowed out from both of their fingers and dyed the short sword red.Roel didn\u2019t say anything in the face of the sudden sharp pain in his finger, but he soon noticed that something was amiss. There was a suction force coming from the wound in his finger, and it was swiftly sapping him of his blood. It was as if he was being tributed to the short sword.\u201cThis is?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not an issue. Trust me.\u201dNora tightened her grip on Roel\u2019s hand as she directed her calm sapphire eyes toward Roel\u2019s golden ones. She noticed that her gesture did calm the latter down a little, and it made her chuckle a little. Then, she closed her eyes and began muttering a prayer.At the same time, Roel also sensed a mysterious power enveloping him.The mysterious power was coming from their blood. As if an arid land frantically absorbing moisture, the blood was swiftly taken in by Ascendwing. It caused the darkness on the surface of the short sword to retreat, revealing the light hidden beneath. That was when it happened.\u201cArgh!\u201dRoel, who was staring at the short sword curiously, suddenly saw some blurred images flashing in his vision. They were all still scenes, as if someone was flipping through an old photo album right before his eyes. He tried to get a clearer look, but he couldn\u2019t focus his sight at all. A searing sensation assaulted his brain, causing him to stagger a little.\u201cRoel? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dNora\u2019s voice jerked Roel back to awareness. While he swiftly regained his senses now, it felt like he had just experienced being pulled into another world. He exchanged glances with the curious sapphire eyes before him for a moment before reassuring her.\u201c\u2026 I-I\u2019m fine.\u201dRoel quickly took a look at his own condition, while contemplating what he had just been through.What was that? A head rush?Surely not. Besides, what sort of head rush would bring about just hallucinations? Could it be that I have been exercising too hard recently?Roel\u2019s first instinct was to rationalize his own condition from a scientific perspective, but he couldn\u2019t ascertain just what in the world happened to him earlier.On the other hand, after receiving a response from Roel, Nora carried on with her ceremony.It took five minutes before Nora finally ended her prayers, and the two of them released their hands. Ascendwing rested before them with a very different appearance from before. Cold light shone from its snowy white surface.\u201cGive it a try. She\u2019s yours now.\u201d\u201cWhat in the world did we just do\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can consider it as a ceremony to unseal the weapon. The Twelve Wings can only be unsealed by the Angel\u2019s Bloodline and a ritual. The reason why we mixed our blood together is so as to make it acknowledge you as well.\u201dNora explained as she passed the entire box over to Roel.Roel took out the half meter long snowy short sword from within and found that its weight was suited perfectly for his use. He tried swinging it around as he asked.\u201cA treasure of this caliber is bound to have some special abilities. What\u2019s the ability of this short sword?\u201d\u201cThat depends on you.\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cThe previous ceremony wasn\u2019t just to have Ascendwing acknowledge you. It also incubates a transcendental ability from our blood offering. This is a gift from the angels, a bestowment that belongs solely to you. The process would usually take around a month.\u201dA bestowment that belongs solely to me?Those words made Roel look at the short sword in his hand with even greater fervor than before. It was a feeling of elation reminiscent of having struck the jackpot.At some point in time, Nora took out an extravagantly ornate short sword that radiated a golden glow.\u201cThat reminds me. Thank you for the present you have given me. While it\u2019s limited in terms of utility, I\u2019m still fairly satisfied with its design.\u201dNora tenderly stroked the birthday present Roel had specially ordered for her. Roel could only smile weakly in response.Aren\u2019t you speaking the obvious? I spent over a hundred gold coins and three different types of gemstones on its design. It\u2019s all money, you know! Who in the world could possibly detest that?Roel was still feeling a pinch in his heart. However, when he looked at the national treasure currently gripped in his hand, the gloomy emotions were all swept away. He waved his hands generously.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you like it. It looks like we have ended up exchanging short swords.\u201dYeap, let\u2019s just call it quits with that!Roel was too busy soothing his conscience that he didn\u2019t notice Nora\u2019s body freezing up at his words. She stared at Roel while blushing furiously, mouth opening and closing like a shocked fish. It took a long time before words came out of her.\u201cIf I may ask, do you know the significance behind an exchange of short swords?\u201d\u201cSignificance? What do you mean by that? Is there a deeper meaning for such an action?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026 You buffoon. Go and ask someone.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been here for a while now, and I still have matters to attend to. You should rest well and quickly recover from your injuries.\u201dShooting a glance at the flabbergasted Roel, Nora stood up with her cheeks still burning and bade hurried farewells. Her abrupt actions left Roel at a loss.\u201cW-what is happening? What\u2019s with this atmosphere? It\u2019s almost as if I have done some terrible wrong! It can\u2019t be that it hasthatkind of connotation, can it?\u201dPerplexed and confused, Roel looked at the shimmering treasure in his hands before anxiously calling for the maid standing by the doorway.\u201cAnna, come here! Do you know what an exchange of short swords signifies?\u201d\u201cExchange of short swords? Ahh, are you referring to that tradition?\u201d\u201cTradition?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s common for those from military or knight households to give the woman they are courting with a short sword as a symbol of confession, and if the woman agrees, she would gift one back. It\u2019s a symbol of reciprocation\u2026 However, there are barely any houses that follow this ancient tradition anymore. What\u2019s more popular nowadays is gifting accessories such as rings and necklaces. Hm? Young master, what is that you\u2019re holding over there?\u201dThe Roel X Alicia Ship fanclub manager, Anna, narrowed her eyes upon sighting the short sword in her young master\u2019s hands. The atmosphere around her suddenly grew incredibly heavy as an imposingly impassive look lingered on her face. It took some time before a smile appeared on her once more.\u201cYoung master, you\u2019re still recuperating. It won\u2019t do for you to dabble with weapons in your current condition. Can you tell where the sword in your hands came from?\u201d\u201cAh, t-this\u2026\u201dSensing a mysterious pressure weighing down on him, Roel suddenly found himself in a fluster. His eyes darted around the place as he struggled to find the right answer.\u201cI-it\u2019s a gift from Prince Kane!\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see. Please be careful not to injure yourself. If you have any problems, feel free to call me.\u201dAfter saying those words, Anna left the room and closed the door behind her. In the moment that she was finally out of view, the smile on her face vanished and her complexion darkened. Her inner self was screaming in turmoil.Miss Alicia, bad news!

    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - Meeting the ParPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 56: Meeting the ParentsRoel obtained a national treasure-level short sword from Nora, though it was anticlimactic how this seemingly monumental event barely changed his life at all.The only thing that was noteworthy was probably Anna, for some inexplicable reason, bringing Alicia over to his room right after Nora departed.The warnings from Arwen and Nora, as well as the long lecture from his father, had completely convinced Roel not to wander around the capital. He spent every day peacefully in the Labyrinth Villa.In order to protect Roel, the Ascart House specially dispatched a group of experts from their fiefdom over to the villa. These experts wore silver armor, and were said to be Carter\u2019s personal guards, making them much stronger than ordinary soldiers. Under their protection, there was no need for Roel to be on tenterhooks over every small detail.Besides, there was a long history behind the Labyrinth Villa, which could be seen through its interior design and the artworks placed on display. Each generation\u2019s patriarch had accumulated a mind-boggling amount of books during their lifetime, resulting in the constant expansion of its library. The front and backyards of the villa were also rather spacious, allowing one to move about without feeling too stifled. It could be said to be one of the very few serene locations in the Holy Capital\u2026 though admittedly, its fearsome reputation probably played no small part in that.Every morning, after waking up, Roel would head to the backyard for his morning exercise before heading back to the villa to have breakfast with Carter and Alicia and drum up some Affection Points. Following that, he would either read some books or train his body. During his break time, he would grab a piece of cloth and wipe Ascendwing\u2019s lustrous blade to marvel at his own wealth.The same rules applied for the tea break in the afternoon and dinner. Due to Alicia being too busy with her \u2018home economics\u2019 lessons, the amount of time she had to spend with Roel had decreased. It was probably due to that that the Affection Points he earned from feeding her were higher than usual.In truth, after overcoming her fear back then to stab Bron, Alicia\u2019s phobia of sharp objects had lessened considerably. With a bit of effort, she could at least bring herself to pick up knives and forks. However, whenever Roel saw how the girl was straining herself during mealtime, he couldn\u2019t help but want to help her. Besides\u2026 if Alicia could eat on her own, wouldn\u2019t he lose his job as a human feeder?His daily income of Affection Points would lessen significantly! That\u2019s unacceptable!So, while a large reason was Roel\u2019s selfish motives, Alicia\u2019s mealtime feeding continued. To be honest, he wasn\u2019t too worried about spoiling Alicia, turning her into wastrel; that girl had an independent streak, and it was bone deep. She wasn\u2019t the type to become overly dependent on anyone. It would probably be more accurate to think of the feedings as a way for the siblings to communicate their feelings; it was just that they\u2019d agreed to it implicitly.\u201cHm? Are we going to spend the new year at the Holy Capital? We aren\u2019t going to head back to our fiefdom?\u201dBusy feeding Alicia at the dining room table, Roel asked in astonishment. Carter elegantly finished with his food and swallowed it down before nodding in response.\u201cYes. There has been a snowstorm over the past two days, which will lengthen our journey significantly. It\u2019s no joke to spend the night outside under such weather conditions, especially since it hasn\u2019t been long since you recovered from your injuries.\u201d\u201cMe? I\u2019m fine. Are we really staying here just because the weather is bad?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s only one of the reasons. Other than that, I suspect that the journey back could be fraught with dangers too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCarter\u2019s words made Roel fall silent. Needless to say, what was worrying Carter wasn\u2019t the presence of bandits or wild beasts. However, since Carter didn\u2019t have the intention to elaborate on it, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to probe deeper either.Since the atmosphere around the dining room table had grown too heavy, Carter brought up a lighter topic.\u201cAh, yes. This could actually be good news for the two of you. The new year celebration in the Holy Capital is far more lively than that of our Ascart City. When I was younger, I would ask your grandfather to bring me here during this period.\u201d\u201cOh? Are there special activities over the new year?\u201d\u201cOf course! There\u2019s the New Year Ball at the royal palace, the New Year Prayers at the Saint Faron Church, the distribution of holy candies, and, not to forget, the famous choir competition of the Theocracy. The results of the competition are decided by popular vote, so it becomes especially lively.\u201dCarter got excited himself just talking about the various programs that would be coming up in Holy Capital Loren over the new year holiday. Roel and Alicia were also getting a little interested in it.The Xeclydes would be holding two events.One of them was a New Year Ball in the royal palace for the nobles. It was not much different from the new year banquets that nobles hold in their own fiefdoms too, just that the location would be the royal palace and at a far grander scale.The other one was the New Year Prayers, an activity exclusive to the Genesis Goddess Church.The Saint Faron Church was constructed more than 600 years ago, and it had since then been mostly used for hosting large scale church events. With the massive crowds that always gather to pray for the new year, it was the only location big enough.After the prayers were over, the next event on the timeline would be the National Choir Competition Finals. It was a program pretty similar to the New Year Galas held back on Earth. Every single person present would be given a vote, which they could use to support their favorite team once the performances were over. The rankings were determined solely through the votes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn the afternoon, there would be carriages traveling down the street in front of the royal palace and the church to distribute sweets, namely the so-called holy candy. Sweets were, by no means, cheap in this era, so this was also a very popular annual event. Huge crowds would be lined up along the roadside every year, waiting for the carriages to arrive.With so many events prepared, it would be hard for the new year celebrations not to be lively. Not to mention, there were also plenty of tourists and devout believers dropping by during this period of time to join in the festivities or offer their prayers.\u201cIt does sound quite interesting.\u201dHearing Carter\u2019s vivid descriptions, Roel and Alicia traded gazes, and the gloomy atmosphere looming between them vanished in an instant. They had already made up their minds to enjoy the holiday here.Roel had never gotten to enjoy the liveliness of a crowd, not since he transmigrated here, since the population density is much lower. This would be a rare chance for him to have some fun and let loose, and he intended to make full use of it.Perhaps it was to prepare for the new year celebration, but Nora didn\u2019t drop by anymore ever since the last since she came over to deliver the Twelve Wings\u2019 short sword. Roel welcomed this situation with all his heart. While it was impossible for him to completely sever relationships with her, he was still determined to put some distance between the two of them.Stray away from the storyline, live a life of peace.Roel also resumed his lessons after recovering from his injuries. It was not too difficult to hire a good teacher in Holy Capital Loren, especially since many of the teachers were having their end-of-year break, and they were more than willing to earn some extra income from the Ascart House.For someone who had been through the rigorous education syllabi back on Earth, the classes in this world were, to be honest, more than doable. The only issue he faced was memorizing the content relating to history, geography, culture, and religion.Many of the hired teachers were shocked to see the young master of the Ascart House, who was rumored to be inept and ignorant, display astounding wits and intelligence. Often, he was able to read between the lines and go beyond what they covered in classes. Considering the usual suffering they would endure at the hands of the impish scions, teaching Roel was like a breath of fresh air to them, making them feel fulfilled as a teacher.Due to that, Roel\u2019s reputation swiftly underwent a 180-degree change.As for transcendental abilities, Roel was still at a slow, natural growth phase. For those beneath Origin Level 5 and therefore unable to acquire any Origin Attribute yet, the only ways to raise their strength were physical training and spell practice. Roel didn\u2019t slack off in either. Through his efforts, his fighting prowess should be ranked slightly above average compared to the other Origin Level 6s. At the very least, he should have a slight lead compared to his peers.While it was still nothing noteworthy compared to Nora\u2019s Origin Tier 5, Roel told himself that there was no need to compare himself with a monster. She was an angel after all, so it was only natural that she was stronger than him.Days passed fruitfully as Roel slowly developed his competence.Just as it was coming close to the end of the year, Carter suddenly dropped a bomb on Roel.\u201cThe Holy Eminence wishes to meet you.\u201dRoel\u2019s mind went completely blank. It went without saying that he knew who the \u2018Holy Eminence\u2019 referred to.John Xeclyde, the pope of the largest religion of mankind, the emperor of the Saint Mesit Theocracy, the patriarch of the Xeclyde House, the envoy of God, the first disciple\u2026 There were simply too many titles that it was impossible to remember all of them.A more intimate way of referring to him from Roel\u2019s perspective was probably \u2018Nora\u2019s grandfather\u2019.There were hundreds of millions of people living on the Sia Continent, but the number of people who dared to oppose him could definitely be counted with one hand. His influence was publicly acknowledged to be the greatest on the Sia Continent. Receiving an audience from him was a big deal, especially when he was viewed to be one of the greatest heroes of mankind.In his younger years, John Xeclyde had once defeated the high priest of the deviants during a holy war.What were the deviants? There were many official explanations to that, but the vibe that Roel got from playing the game was that they were a bunch of mindless beastmen. They lived in the Lost Domain\u2014the region that humans had already migrated from\u2014and their bodies suffered a high degree of mutation. These beastmen were unable to communicate with humans, but there was still great enmity between them and humankind for one single reason\u2014they ate humans.Deviants shared a striking level of resemblance to humans, but they were definitely not humans. On the contrary, they wouldn\u2019t hesitate to gobble down any human that they encountered, thus making them the nemesis of the human civilization. This was a natural predator-prey relationship, so there was no room for reconciliation at all.The beastmen had invaded the western Sia Continent four times thus far, and they caused huge disturbances every single time. Whole countries had been destroyed under their savagery.In the holy war 80 years ago, the humans and the beastmen spent 22 months locked in a stalemate before the humans finally found an opportunity to make a breakthrough. In the Battle of Establishment, John personally killed the beastmen\u2019s high priest, but he sustained heavy wounds and nearly died as well. It was thanks to the relentless charge of Pendor\u2019s knights that he was saved from the clutches of death.This had been the greatest war achievement of the human race against foreign species. John Xeclyde\u2019s name spread far and wide, and he was loved by the whole of humankind. Naturally, this meant that his seat on the throne was stable too.Every year, countless devout believers would embark on a pilgrimage to Holy Capital Loren just to catch a glimpse of him from afar. They would scream in excitement like fans meeting their idol, and there were even a few who went to the extent of kneeling down from sheer agitation.Now, this idol of humanity who transcended territorial boundaries actually wanted to meet Roel! Needless to say, he felt flustered. It was similar to how if you were sitting at home one day then you suddenly received a call informing you that the leader of your country wished to meet you. There was no one who wouldn\u2019t be bewildered by that!John Xeclyde didn\u2019t appear in the game, so Roel was unfamiliar with his appearance and personality. There was no prior knowledge he could use to prepare himself for this audience. If he were to accidentally speak the wrong words\u2026\u2026 Oh, it doesn\u2019t look like anything will happen either.Roel suddenly snapped out of his daze. He shot a glance at his composed father and the two maids on standby near the dining table, and he suddenly recalled what his current identity was.The Holy Eminence was formidable, but the Ascart House was no pushover either! Besides, their houses were still in the honeymoon phase of buttering each other up with sweet words.Also, as much as Roel wanted to deny it, his relationship with Nora was still fairly good. The bestowment of Ascendwing was a gesture of goodwill from the Xeclydes, possibly by order of the Holy Eminence himself even. Looking at it from such a perspective, it didn\u2019t seem like there was any need for him to lose his nerves.He\u2019s just a grandpa from a neighboring house. Yeap, sounds about right.As Roel was trying to convince himself that it was no big deal, time ticked on. Before long, the Third Epoch, Year 1004 was already nearing its end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - Before the CrowdPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 57: Before the CrowdThe night before the new year, Roel Ascart sat in a carriage that was galloping straight toward the majestic Saint Faron Church.The carriage was comfortable and spacious, but it wasn\u2019t a property of the Ascart House. The insignia of the Guardian of Radiant Wings revealed that it was a royal carriage.On this very day, the Xeclydes, known to be the envoys of Goddess Sia due to their Angel\u2019s Bloodline, were incredibly busy making arrangements for their two upcoming major events. They had to host the prayers over at the Saint Faron Church while simultaneously preparing for the New Year Ball that would be held in the royal palace later at night.Carter, as a marquess and a military man, was obliged to attend the ball. Alicia didn\u2019t have any obligations or prior commitments and could technically head to wherever she wanted. Out of safety considerations though, Roel requested his father to bring her together with him, so as to look after her. In view of the mishap that happened back during Nora\u2019s birthday banquet, Carter approved of Roel\u2019s suggestion too.As a result, Roel was left all alone.When the decision was made, the ruby eyes of Alicia, who was looking forward to enjoying the new year festivities with Roel, immediately reddened. She grabbed Roel\u2019s hand tightly for a long while before she was finally able to bring herself to let go. Before heading off with Carter, she made sure to remind Roel.\u201cLord Brother, I heard that Her Highness Nora will be leading the hymns and prayers today. It would be advisable for you to avoid talking to her, so that she can save her energy for the occasion.\u201d\u201cOh? Is that so?\u201dThis was the first time Roel was hearing that Nora was leading the hymns and prayers. That would explain why she seemed to have vanished from the face of the world for the past two weeks.Most likely, she had been putting all of her efforts into ensuring that everything went perfect. Thinking about it, it almost seemed like an idol trainee preparing for her center stage debut. With her beauty, her popularity would surely skyrocket.\u201cBut, isn\u2019t it fine if it\u2019s just a casual chat?\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t do! Ah. No, what I mean to say is that\u2026 we can always pay a visit to Her Highness together later on! You can save your words till then.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dAlicia appeared to be looking at Roel with a smile, but her attention was actually on the short sword hanging by his waist. Her expression remained warm and cordial, but her hands had already tightened into fists.The Roel X Alicia Ship fanclub manager, Anna, had used her connections to inform Alicia about Nora and Roel exchanging short swords. Initially, Alicia was devastated by the news, but when she headed over to confront Roel with tears glistening in her eyes, she realized that he thought nothing about the matter at all. It was all a misunderstanding.Nevertheless, this incident made her wary of her rival\u2019s schemes.Nora. This was an opponent that the introverted Alicia would have never dared to go against normally. Any peer who dared to challenge Nora would only be embarrassed by their own shortcomings. However, the feelings that were burning in Alicia\u2019s heart made her unwilling to yield so easily.My greatest advantage is that I\u2019m always by Lord Brother\u2019s side. Her Highness is a formidable opponent, but she\u2019s unable to accompany him all the time. Lord Father has also recognized me too. As long as Lord Brother reciprocates\u2026\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be making a move first. See you tomorrow, Alicia.\u201dA warm hand gently patted the head of the contemplating silver-haired girl, causing her mind to go blank. She raised her head to look at the smiling Roel, and a faint blush appeared on her fair skin.\u201cL-l-lord Brother, see you.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith her brain overheating, it took Alicia everything she had to stutter out her farewells, before she watched Roel getting into the carriage and departing.For the past hour since then, Roel had been sitting all alone inside this carriage.It must be said that the Xeclydes were indeed very considerate. They dispatched a whole platoon of knights to accompany him and ensure his safety, but due to that, the journey was much slower than expected. Not to mention, the street was congested too. It took an entire hour before the carriage managed to reach the midpoint of the street. At the end of the avenue was the magnificent Saint Faron Church.\u201cThere sure are a lot of people around. I wonder where they all popped out from.\u201dGlancing out of the window, Roel refreshed his definition of what the concept of \u2018congested\u2019 meant.How should I describe this sight? A sea of heads? Even sardines aren\u2019t put through something like this! It almost looks like people are overlapping with one another!Roel couldn\u2019t help but recall a video he saw in his previous life of train conductors literally packing humans into trains in a certain country. It seemed like he had underestimated the influence of the Genesis Goddess Church.And just like how he was observing the crowd, the crowd was observing him too.\u201cLook!\u201d\u201cThat insignia! It\u2019s the carriage of the royal family!\u201d\u201cWho is inside? Could it be Her Highness Nora?\u201dA huge commotion broke out amidst the crowd when they noticed the Xeclydes\u2019 carriage. Roel quickly pulled down the blinds to conceal himself. The platoon accelerated through the empty central aisle of the avenue. It seemed like even the coachman and the knights weren\u2019t accustomed to being observed by so many people.It was just unfortunate that carriages weren\u2019t allowed into the church itself, so the platoon had no choice but to stop by the side gate. Roel quickly fixed up his appearance, pinned the Emblem of Glory on his chest, and took a deep breath as he prepared himself to appear in the limelight.Despite so, the moment the carriage doors opened, Roel still stiffened up.So many people! Even with a quick glance, I can already tell there are several thousand people here!Facing thousands of eyes focused on him, Roel couldn\u2019t help but feel great pressure crushing down on him. In a moment of ingenuity, he used his spell, Controlled Breathing, to forcefully calm down his stage fright.So, at the entrance to the restricted area of the Saint Faron Church, surrounded by a platoon of knights, the crowd saw a black-haired, golden-eyed little boy steadily walking down from a carriage that represented unrivaled authority and standing. His suave appearance was pleasing to the eye. Despite his young age, he had an indescribable charm that easily won him the crowd\u2019s goodwill.He was dressed in a luxurious white formal suit. Slotted at his waist was a short sword of unknown origin but emanating an air of holiness. As his black shoes fell on the red carpet, the crowd could see that his height only reached up to the chests of the tall knights. However, his composed and confident disposition formed a stark contrast to the guarded knights around him.\u201cWho is that little boy?\u201d\u201cWuuu, he\u2019s so adorable! He\u2019s like a small angel!\u201d\u201cCould he be an illegitimate son of the royal family?\u201d\u201cLord Roel, for your own safety, please quickly enter the church.\u201dThe huge crowd made it harder for the knights to ensure Roel\u2019s safety, so they quickly converged together to form a tight circle around him. The chief of the knight platoon felt a little pressured by the circumstances, but knowing how close relations were between this young master of the Ascart House and the royal family, he dared not to hurry him too much. As a result, he could only lower his body and advise him quietly.Roel nodded lightly with approval and cooperated with the knight platoon. This made the platoon commander heave a sigh of relief.\u201cKnight platoon, form two rows by the side and pay heed to your surroundings. If anyone dares to come too close, do not hesitate to take him down!\u201dThe commander passed out his orders.Twenty knights quickly positioned themselves in two rows and pointed their swords outward, creating a path for Roel to pass through. As Roel walked grandly through the procession, countless eyes looked at him with fondness, wonderment, and adoration.(Affection Points +1, +3, +2, +5, +4, +2\u2026)\u201cI see. So this is what it feels like to be the center of attention\u2026\u201dRoel muttered to himself as he walked through the doors of the church.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - Perhaps It\u2019s FatePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 58: Perhaps It\u2019s FateSaint Faron Church.This was an old building with several centuries of history behind it. It should have looked a little weathered, but to Roel\u2019s surprise, it looked tremendously resplendent and beautiful.There was a brilliant source of illumination within that was as stable as the light bulbs in his previous world, allowing those walking through the corridors to marvel at the uncountable murals covering the walls and ceiling alike.Roel\u2019s understanding of the Genesis Goddess Church was still quite limited, so he couldn\u2019t understand a lot of the depictions in the murals. Nevertheless, as a noble, he had come into contact with a lot of artwork ever since his younger years, which cultivated his appreciation for fine works. In his view, these murals were wonderfully exquisite, and many of them were indubitably the magnum opus of famed painters.For so many masterpieces to be placed side by side with one another, it was definitely a haven for art lovers.This was a testament to the long history behind the church, as well as the influence it commanded. It demanded deference from those who stepped through its doors.Under the lead of the church\u2019s staff, Roel was brought to the assembly hall\u2026 and he suddenly found himself left all alone there.It was not that the church\u2019s staff were intentionally snubbing him, but they were simply too busy preparing to receive the crowd for the prayers, and the severe lack of manpower wasn\u2019t helping at all. Left with no choice, Roel simply took a look around the church by himself for an hour before he finally went to meet Holy Eminence John Xeclyde.John Xeclyde was a white-haired old man who looked surprisingly unkempt, even though that was just by the standards of the more straight-laced nobles. In terms of appearance, he looked no different from any of the citizens he met outside the church earlier. However, if one were to take a closer look, one would realize that despite the lack of a smile on his face, he still gave off an air of benevolence.Wearing a set of white holy robes, he sat upon a stone chair placed atop a red carpet. The illumination in the room was slightly dim, but it somehow felt like the light that was there was focused on the man. It was a mysterious feeling, indescribable by words. It was almost as if meeting a character who had walked straight out of an epic saga.However, Roel knew the reason behind this feeling.Origin Attribute Compassion.This was one of the Origin Attributes that had remained firmly under the control of the Xeclyde House since ancient times. Carter once told him that a high-level transcendent of Compassion would appear like a sage before the eyes of mortals, while lies and sins couldn\u2019t hope to deceive his eyes.\u201cRoel Ascart from the Ascart House pays respects to Your Eminence. It\u2019s my deepest pleasure to meet you.\u201dFaced with a man who wielded powers far beyond his imagination, Roel wouldn\u2019t dare to show any disrespect. He placed his palm on his chest and reported his own background, displaying how well brought up he was.On the other hand, witnessing the serious look on the adorable black-haired boy\u2019s face, John burst into laughter.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for this, child. Come here. I have heard of a lot about you from Nora.\u201dJohn had a deep voice that came with age which felt comfortable and set people at ease. When he mentioned Nora\u2019s name, Roel suddenly had a feeling as if he was meeting the grandparent of a classmate.He carefully approached, and to his surprise, the latter really was just like a neighborhood grandpa.\u201cWould you like to have some fruit?\u201d\u201cAh, no. I had dinner before I came.\u201d\u201cMmm. Our fruits are all there, so feel free to take them when you\u2019re in the mood for it. We just brought them in today, so they\u2019re still fresh.\u201dRoel was rendered speechless by this conversation. It sounded almost as if His Holy Eminence was coaxing a child!What he didn\u2019t know, though, was that he was indeed a child in John\u2019s eyes. John was over a hundred years old whereas Roel was only 10, the same age as his granddaughter. In truth, he didn\u2019t have any real business with Roel. He simply wanted to get closer to the Ascart House and meet this rare \u2018good friend\u2019 of his granddaughter.\u201cHow is the short sword? Have you tried it out yet?\u201d\u201cYes, the sword is very handy. I heard from Her Highness Nora that it acquires an adaptation effect from the absorption of my blood.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Ascendwing is a rather special weapon even amongst holy artifacts. It has the unique strength of incubating abilities. I believe that the incubation should be completed within the next few days\u2026 Wait a moment. Hmmm?\u201dJohn was speaking while stroking the featherlike inscriptions of the short sword when he suddenly halted. He lowered his gaze to look more closely at the blade and blinked his eyes. He could sense the vibrant vitality of the ones contracted with the short sword\u2014Roel and Nora\u2019s vitality. These were the basic elements required to form an ability within the sword. However, what was unusual about this was that the sheer amount of vitality was overwhelming.\u201cA high level of compatibility? I didn\u2019t expect that it would\u2026\u201dJohn Xeclyde began muttering under his breath as he examined Ascendwing again and again. All of a sudden, he raised his gaze to look at Roel.\u201cChild, your sword could very well incubate two abilities.\u201d\u201cTwo abilities?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Your power has a high level of compatibility with Nora\u2019s\u2026\u201dJohn Xeclyde swiftly began to fill in the details for Roel. According to him, the purpose of the blood tribute ritual for Ascendwing was for the royal family to use the power of their own bloodline to bestow a special ability to the receiver of the sword. In other words, it was a buff.From time to time though, there would be a recipient whose bloodline was exceptionally compatible with that of the royal family, thus leading to another outcome\u2014double buffing. With two powerful bloodlines complementing one another, there was a high chance that the short sword would develop a second ability.Such a happening was extremely rare though. It had only happened once in known history.\u201cGood friends with powerful bloodlines that complement one another. Bless Sia. The two of you are destined to stand alongside one another.\u201d(Affection Points +200!)This unexpected surprise delighted John greatly. He felt that this could be guidance from the great Sia. Even the look he directed toward Roel became far more amicable than before.The one who was smashed with the news, however, looked nothing less than dumbstruck.Compatible? Me and her? That\u2019s impossible! Are you insinuating that I\u2019m a masochist?Son of a banshee! I must never let her know of this matter!Oblivious to Roel\u2019s horror, John was still immersed in the delight from stumbling upon such joyous news. Due to that, he decided to talk a little more than he intended to.\u201cChild, I have heard of your affairs. You have done well. There aren\u2019t many young nobles like you who embrace justice in their hearts. Decades of peace has bred a swelling whirlpool of desire and corruption that has tainted far too many people.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJohn sighed as he thought about the times when he was still a hot-blooded young man.\u201cI have spent my lifetime fighting against the darkness, and that might be the fate awaiting both you and Nora too. Different eras have different darknesses. The darkness I had to face was on the battlefield, but it seems unlikely to be the same for you. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that your enemies are weak. On the contrary, they are furtive and hidden deep among us.\u201dJohn lowered his sight to look into Roel\u2019s confused golden eyes, and he seemed to be seeing something different from what others did. There was a short moment of silence before he continued.\u201cYou belong to a house with a very long history, but time has erased far too much from your lineage\u2026 I pray that you\u2019ll, one day, be able to revive the greatness of the past.\u201dJohn sighed once more after saying those words. Roel could smell the scent of a mystery in those words.Lineage? Revive the greatness of the past? What does that mean?\u201cYour Eminence, it\u2019s about time.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m coming\u2026 Child, let\u2019s end our conversation here. May Sia\u2019s blessings be with you.\u201dHearing the reminder from an attendant outside, John concluded their conversation. Before he left, he placed his hand on Roel\u2019s head and gave away his first blessing of the year. Then he headed off to conduct the New Year Prayer.On the other hand, Roel found himself ushering in the new year with a load of doubts on his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The event started before midnight, but every single recitation of the holy scripture and prayers lasted for around two hours\u2014and it repeated three times. It was only when dawn arrived that the event finally concluded.As the guest of the Holy Eminence, it went without saying that Roel was accorded with special privileges. He was given a spot in the VIP section, where the esteemed guests coming from all over the continent were gathered.If anyone thought that being placed in the VIP section was a blessing, they couldn\u2019t be more wrong. There were no snacks to munch and no sofa to lounge on here. In reality, it was just a fancy way of referring to the positions closest to Grandpa John.Yes, there was no seating at all; it was just an area with dozens of large pavers placed right in front of the stage where the Holy Eminence was speaking from. Granted every single VIP guest was given their own personal floor tile to pray from\u2014at least it was more spacious than the packed-like-sardines crowd behind\u2014however, Roel still had to stand alongside these devout believers throughout the entire course of the event till daylight.What kind of horrendous torture is this?!The hardly-a-believer Roel felt extremely distressed about this situation.In the first place, he had hardly any interest in this event at all! But as the guest of the Holy Eminence, he couldn\u2019t afford to take his leave halfway through the event. That would be a blatant show of disrespect toward Grandpa John!As a result, Roel was doomed to a night of suffering. He stood all the way from midnight till daylight, only receiving two short breaks in the middle. It was only at the end of the third set of prayers that he was finally liberated.Of course, there weren\u2019t too many people like Roel who thought of this event as suffering. Most of the believers were still quite excited about the new year.Furthermore, after the New Year Prayers, the royal family would be distributing the first wave of holy candies. This was an event that appealed to the masses. There was a prevailing notion that anyone who managed to collect the most holy candies in the first wave would be granted the most blessings for the year. In a sense, this was similar to how some people thought that being the first to visit a temple and light a joss stick for the new year would bring great luck for the next twelve months.As a result, the crowd standing by the sides of the streets only continued to grow with time.Unfortunately, Roel wasn\u2019t too interested in the good omen that came with this activity. In the first place, he had received the direct blessing from the Holy Eminence himself before the New Year Prayer. As for the holy candies, all he had to do was mention it in front of Nora to obtain an entire jar of them.But again, candies from Little Miss Angel would never come free. It was her expertise to use all sorts of events to stir-up trouble. Just thinking about it was enough to send a shudder down Roel\u2019s spine. He felt that he would be better off without those holy candies.Under the escort of the knights, Roel got back onto the carriage and headed back to the Labyrinth Villa. On the way back, he peered through the windows and saw groups of people returning home with joyful smiles on their faces.Upon arrival at the destination, Roel got down from the carriage and placed 10 gold coins in the hand of the captain of the knight platoon.\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the new year. I can\u2019t have you all working overtime without receiving anything in return. Thank you for your protection.\u201d\u201cHaha! Thank you for your generosity, Lord Roel. May Sia bless you!\u201dHaving received some easy money, the knights waved Roel goodbye with smiles on their faces. Roel bade them farewell too before entering the Labyrinth Villa under the escort of the servants, only to realize that no one had returned yet.Carter, Alicia, and even Anna weren\u2019t around.\u201cHm? Where are they?\u201d\u201cThe old master has sent news informing us that Prince Kane will be bringing the nobles for a New Year Hunt, and that he would be attending together with Miss Alicia. It\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll only be returning the following night.\u201d\u201cAh? The following night?\u201dDoes this mean that I\u2019m going to spend the new year by myself? You must be kidding! Tsk, if only I had known in advance, I wouldn\u2019t have come back. It\u2019s too lonesome being here by myself.Roel stared out at the seemingly empty house and the unfamiliar servants stationed at the Holy Capital, and he suddenly had a bizarre feeling that he was a guest in his own house.\u201cForget it. I\u2019m tired, so I\u2019ll be heading off to sleep.\u201dWith a light yawn, Roel grumbled about having to spend a new year without Alicia as he trudged back to his room. Following that, he took off his coat and sprawled over his bed.Before long, he was already in dreamland\u2014\u2014When Roel opened his eyes once more, the house was already completely dark. There was only a faint light behind him that vaguely illuminated the room. Feeling uncomfortable from sleeping on his stomach for too long, he flipped over onto his back before exhaling deeply in relief. The new position felt much more comfortable.\u201cHaah, what time is it?\u201d\u201cSix at night.\u201d\u201cWAH!\u201dThe unexpected response from his bedside made Roel leap up in horror. He saw a golden-haired girl sitting on a chair beside him. She was laughing heartily after witnessing his terrified reaction.\u201cHahaha! Your reaction was truly entertaining. My time wasn\u2019t wasted waiting for you to wake up.\u201dRoel glared at the chuckling princess with bared fangs, looking almost as if he would draw his sword against her. Nora decided to quickly rein in her laughter.\u201cSay, is it really appropriate for you to enter my room without permission?\u201d\u201cHm, you don\u2019t like it? Wasn\u2019t it exciting for you when you saw me?\u201d\u201cExciting your head!\u201d refuted Roel mercilessly.He took a look around the room to search for his servants, but Nora immediately interjected.\u201cI have already swapped out all of your servants. Everyone here now works for me.\u201d\u201c???\u201dWhat does this mean? A kidnapping? All I did was take a nap, yet you managed to pull off so many tricks behind my back?\u201cSpeaking of which, what are you doing here? For goodness sake, it\u2019s the new year. Can\u2019t you let me off on such a festive day?\u201dRoel could only grumble out his complaints.\u201cHow heartless. You know that I\u2019m here to accompany you. This is an honor that countless people dream of.\u201dNora revealed the reason why she was here with a smile, rendering Roel speechless.To put it simply, the New Year Hunt had happened on a whim, most probably due to the nobles getting too drunk on alcohol. Not only was the Ascart House emptied out, but there was hardly anyone in the royal palace too. Roel, who didn\u2019t attend the banquet due to his audience with John, and Nora, who had been preparing for the choir competition, were among the few people who were left behind.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHoly Eminence John was also busy over the new year. He had to meet the believers in influential positions coming from all over the continent, so he really couldn\u2019t fork out any time to accompany his granddaughter.Having expected this situation, Prince Kane had told Nora to bring a chef, a coachman, and a large group of servants, and head over to the Labyrinth Villa to find Roel. The two children were close with one another anyway, so it was perfect to have them spend the new year together and further deepen their friendship.It was just that Roel felt that a lioness had just crept into his house and was holding him hostage.\u201cYou didn\u2019t come to watch my performance. I was looking forward to seeing you amongst the audience.\u201dNora eyed Roel with narrowed eyes, displeased that one of her expectations was dashed. It was only then that Roel noticed that she was still wearing the ceremonial robes of the church\u2019s choir. On top of that, she had also applied some Demon\u2019s Dew which harmonized her pure disposition and seductiveness together into a fatal charm.\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. I was too tired from having to stand for an entire night. So\u2026 d-did you win?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dNora\u2019s matter-of-fact answer allowed Roel to heave a sigh of relief, but Nora wasn\u2019t intending to let him off so easily.\u201cI might have won, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you neglected to cheer on a good friend.\u201d\u201cT-then\u2026 What do you want?\u201d\u201cLook at how defensive you are getting. I\u2019m a benevolent person, so how could I possibly not forgive you over this slight mistake that you have made? In fact, I\u2019m here to offer you some sweets. Mia.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dUpon Nora\u2019s call, a maid standing outside immediately carried a container into the room. Nora took out a holy candy from the container and unwrapped it. Holding the candy between her fingers, she looked at the bewildered Roel with a smile filled with desire.\u201cCome, lick it. It\u2019s sweet.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her blushing cheeks and glinting eyes revealed the excitement pounding in the depths of her heart. Even her lips were curled up in mischief.She was truly beautiful.Looking at her under the dim illumination, Roel couldn\u2019t help but gulp down a mouthful of saliva. Nora did have a fatally seductive charm, and there was no question that she was good to Roel.After all, in the original story, Nora told the main character, who was the prince of an empire, to lick her shoes. Just to emphasize once more, it was not even her legs but her shoes. But over here, she allowed Roel to lick her fingers. It was obviously preferential treatment\u2026 somewhat.Was Roel moved?Looking at the beauty who was tempting him like the snake in Eden\u2019s Garden, it would be a lie if Roel said that he wasn\u2019t moved\u2026 It was tempting to get close to Nora, but it would be a catastrophe for a villain like him!Roel hadn\u2019t forgotten what his current position was. He was still in the midst of pulling out his death flags, so he was compelled to make different decisions from the original Roel. It was always better to be on the safer side.\u201cYou can keep it. I\u2019m not going to eat it.\u201dRoel turned his head away as he replied with an impassive tone. Not understanding Roel\u2019s reaction, Nora frowned in incomprehension.\u201cWhy? You obviously look very moved.\u201d\u201cHaa? Who are you saying is moved? Stop talking nonsense. Besides, did you even wash your hands? I\u2019m not fond of eating things that others have held in their hands.\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019ve washed my hands! Are you really not going to eat it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dRoel\u2019s response displeased Little Miss Angel. She began complaining under her breath.\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why are you so opposed to me? You wouldn\u2019t even eat the sweet that I unwrapped for you.\u201d\u201cIs the main point the sweet? You just want to see me lick the sweet because it\u2019s in your hand!\u201dRoel\u2019s accusations brought a slight hint of embarrassment to Nora\u2019s face. She quickly averted her eyes.\u201cS-sweets are important! They are blessings for the new year!\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you give them to me directly?\u201d\u201cHm? Mister Roel, are your hands clean? Somehow, I seem to recall that you are a person who is obsessed with hygiene.\u201dNora mocked him with his own words. Roel could only awkwardly retract his already outstretched hand.\u201cYou can wrap the wrapper around the sweet first, before passing it to me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already thrown away the wrapper.\u201d\u201cToss it directly into my mouth then.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re already at Origin Level 5, but you can\u2019t even aim a throw properly?\u201d\u201cTsk. Fine. Open your mouth wide then.\u201dNora clicked her tongue in displeasure as she tossed the sweet into Roel\u2019s mouth.Roel sucked on the sweet as he looked at the defeated golden-haired girl with a triumphant smile on his lips.Heh, you wish to fight with me? Wait a hundred years more!Roel was gleeful to have won a battle, but before he could fully relish in his victory, a smile suddenly crept onto Nora\u2019s face. She placed her hand on her cheek and spoke words that utterly crushed every bit of his happiness.\u201cIs this the joy of feeding a pet?\u201d\u201cCough! What\u2026\u201d\u201cYou looked so adorable when you caught my sweet. It was like a dog biting down on a ball.\u201d\u201cThe hell! You fooled me?!\u201dHaving been messed with by Nora, veteran actor Roel felt as if he had been deeply humiliated. On the other hand, Nora nodded her head in satisfaction.\u201cActually, this isn\u2019t too bad either. I do enjoy this quite a bit. Let\u2019s do it again next time.\u201d\u201cNext time your head! Don\u2019t even dream about it!\u201d\u201cMm, your looks of frustration are not bad too.\u201dDamn it! I can\u2019t fawn on her, and I can\u2019t get angry too. Why is this lass so hard to deal with?It was sweet on the tip of his tongue, but bitter in the depths of his heart. He felt so frustrated that he could burst right into tears, but Nora would probably just enjoy the show if he were to do so.Tsk. Forget it. I shan\u2019t get angry. Calm down. Calm down!After finally calming himself down, Roel leaped down from his bed and left the room. Nora also stood up and followed suit.\u201cYou woke up at a good time. It\u2019s about time for dinner, so let\u2019s eat together.\u201dNora proposed with the intention of making up with him.Employing the carrot and the stick, huh? Do you think I\u2019ll be bribed that easily?Roel snorted coldly, thinking nothing of her goodwill.\u201cI\u2019ve brought the royal chefs with me. The ingredients are fresh too.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s head over right away!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs a certified foodie, Roel could hold a grudge against anything except food. As compared to throwing a tantrum against Nora, stuffing his mouth with delicacies was simply far more important. So, the two of them moved to the dining room, got into their seats, and readied themselves for a ride of exquisite flavors.Black pearl caviar from the Northern Sea, lamb meat from Hyde Plateau, and all sorts of famed ingredients were presented one after another, bringing euphoria to Roel\u2019s tongue and sending it to new highs. It was a meal more magnificent than anything he had experienced.The most valuable dish of the entire dinner was the golden truffle from the Great Pokhla Forest. It had an outer appearance that was as brilliant as gleaming gold, but when one cut into it, its white lustrous flesh would be revealed. Its deep and unique aroma provided an explosion of flavor that would easily satisfy any gourmet.Due to that, the golden truffle had always been ranked within the top three delicacies of the Sia Continent. It was so valuable that even the Ascart House would struggle to afford it.The conditions for the growth of one of these golden truffles was so extreme that it was impossible to cultivate it. As such, the amount produced every year was extremely limited. Most of it was already consumed internally within the Pendor Kingdom itself, where the Great Pokhla Forest was located, and the amount that was exported was only enough to distribute a set to the royalties all over the continent.That went to show just how valuable this ingredient was. If not for Nora, Roel might have never been able to eat it in his lifetime.The golden truffle was lightly grilled using a flavorless oil and then perfectly complemented by a glass of fruit wine made out of mango, honey, ginger, almond, peppermint, orange blossom, and white grapes. It was truly a culinary experience that Roel could hardly pick any flaws with.Too moved by the delicacies, Roel\u2019s eyes narrowed in bliss as his pupils twinkled with delight. The golden-haired girl sitting across from him smiled in amusement at the sight.\u201cYou\u2019re so hard to deal with usually\u2026 yet it\u2019s so easy to bribe you with good food.\u201d\u201cThat depends on the quality of the food. I\u2019m more than willing to be bribed by something of this level.\u201d\u201cIs that so? It looks like I need to be wary of Pendor in the future.\u201dNora couldn\u2019t resist teasing a little. However, Roel disagreed with her view.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. I\u2019ll be holed up in my fiefdom in the future. I doubt that anyone would waste their money trying to bribe me.\u201d\u201cHm? You still haven\u2019t changed your mind yet? Are you really not thinking of joining the military like Uncle Carter?\u201d\u201cFor a weakling like me who is unable to advance beyond Origin Level 6, there\u2019s no meaning in joining the military.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s more to the military than fighting battles. You can always join as an advisor or a consultant. Due to the courage you showed in protecting Alicia from Bron and his cronies, most of those in the military have high hopes for you, you know?\u201dNora\u2019s words surprised Roel. He didn\u2019t think that his desperate brawl with Bron would actually bring about such an effect. Given that the roots of the Ascart House lay within the military, it wasn\u2019t too bad for things to turn out that way. If true, a military career might just work out very well for him.Should I give it a try?Roel was a little moved after hearing Nora\u2019s suggestion, but all of a sudden, he noticed the hidden twinkle in her eyes.Wait a moment, this isn\u2019t right! Isn\u2019t Nora training at the Holy Knight Order?Crap, I\u2019m falling for her ploys again!\u201cI\u2019m grateful that they think of me in such a light, but I\u2019ll have to pass. I\u2019m a cripple without any ambition, so I ask of you not to waste your efforts on me.\u201d\u201cHmph, I can\u2019t even persuade you this much, huh? How obstinate.\u201dSeeing that her plans had failed, Nora sighed deeply for a moment before suddenly smiling to herself once more.\u201cBut, it matters not. We have plenty of time ahead of us.\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t be fun if a game ends too quickly, right?Just like that, Nora and Roel spent the first night of the new year in peace together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He swung his leg lackadaisically as he looked at the ticking clock and sighed deeply.Ey, I can\u2019t fall asleep. I slept too long earlier in the day.He spent two hours eating and chatting with Nora before the latter retired to a guest room to sleep. She had busied herself for the entire day, so it was only natural that she was exhausted. Roel, on the other hand, had more than enough energy to expend. So, he headed to the study room and grabbed a book to read.Fast-forwarding on, it was already midnight, but Roel still felt no inclination to sleep at all. After some thought, he decided to head out for a walk. He put on a coat before coming out of his room.A maid on night duty immediately asked Roel if there was anything that he needed, but he shook his head in response.\u201cI\u2019m just heading out for a walk. There\u2019s no need to follow me.\u201d\u201cYes, Lord Roel.\u201dThe maid respectfully returned to her original position whereas Roel began strolling around the villa alone.My house sure is big.Roel thought as he wandered around the building which had more than a century of history behind it. As the host, it was customary for Roel to bring Nora around the house to take a look, but in view of the poor illumination at night, this matter had been postponed till tomorrow.Nora had really brought quite a lot of people with her. Counting all the maids, chefs, and guards, there had to be more than a hundred people. There were over twenty people on normal night duty, and this was not counting the knight platoon stationed around Nora\u2019s room. The maid with long gray hair named Mia, the one who passed Nora the sweets container earlier, was around too.\u201cYoung master Roel, is there anything I can help you with?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just having difficulties trying to fall asleep, so I\u2019m taking a walk around. Is Her Highness sleeping?\u201d\u201cYes, Her Highness has already been asleep for two hours.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dRoel shot a look of envy at her room. He was just about to take his leave when he suddenly recalled something.\u201cRight, did she manage to win the Chorale Choir Competition today?\u201d\u201cYes, Her Highness has a voice blessed by heaven. The panel of esteemed judges who came from various countries was deeply impressed.\u201dMia proudly replied.Roel nodded in response as he recalled how displeased Nora was about him not watching her competition. He pondered for a moment before asking.\u201cIs there any tool that recorded her voice or performance during the competition?\u201d\u201cAre you referring to the Recording Stone? Of course, we have prepared that too. The church would always record the new year events every year. They would mass-produce the recordings and sell them to other countries so that others can bask in the glory of Sia too.\u201dMia\u2019s words surprised Roel.Now that he thought about it, there was indeed such a thing. It was just that the Ascart House had never bought it before. It was not because Recording Stones were expensive, but the opening event of the church was simply too boring. It was an entire night of prayers! No one but the most devout of believers would have been able to bring themselves to watch people praying for a whopping six hours!\u201cThis includes the choir competition too?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s recorded too.\u201d\u201cCan you bring me a recording of it tomorrow then? I would like to see Her Highness\u2019 performance.\u201dOtherwise, she\u2019s going to keep harping on it for life.Roel supplemented the latter half of the sentence in his heart, but the maid, who heard just the front half of the sentence, interpreted his intention very differently. Her pupils widened in astonishment before the air over her head started to turn green. A smile that carried a mixture of relief and maturity appeared on her face.(Affection Points +200!)Huh, what\u2019s going on? Why are you turning green? What did I do?Roel was rendered speechless by the sudden wave of Affection Points. Thinking back, it seemed like he had an inexplicable ability to make maids go green. It was the same for the servants in his house too. Often, before he knew it, all of them would turn green together.\u201cYoung master Roel is truly considerate. I believe that Her Highness Nora will be pleased if she learns about this.\u201d\u201cN-no, I\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease be assured. I\u2019ll prepare the Recording Stone tomorrow. You\u2019ll receive it at the latest by the day after tomorrow.\u201dMia had become excited; she was all pumped up. Having served Nora for many years, she knew just how lonely her young miss was. Roel appeared to be a decent man to her; he came over here late at night to check on her, and he even requested to obtain the Recording Stone from the church beforehand.He must be anxious to watch the splendor of our young miss as soon as possible!Not to mention, the two of them had backgrounds compatible with one another, and what was even rarer was that they were actually on good terms with one another. Was there any better partner for her young miss than this?For that reason, she decided to give everything she had to help this boy who sought to free her young miss from her loneliness.Seeing the maid thumping her chest with a confident expression that said \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I understand\u2019, Roel, despite all of the doubts lingering in his mind, found himself not knowing what to say at all. In the end, he could only bid Mia farewell and take his leave.\u2026The following day Roel got up early in the morning and began his work as a tour guide. The Labyrinth Villa, even with its hundred years of history, was actually nothing spectacular to the royal family. After all, the royal palace itself had centuries behind it!However, there was one exceptional advantage that the Labyrinth Villa had over the royal palace, and that was the endorsement from celebrities!\u201cThere, do you see the chair over there? Her Majesty Victoria once sat there!\u201d\u201cHere, here. Look at the lamp over here. Her Majesty Victoria once used it!\u201dRoel simply vomited word-for-word everything that the excited Carter had said when the latter brought him around the house when he first arrived.Actually, the responsibility of the servants of the Labyrinth Villa wasn\u2019t really to take care of the family members of the Ascart House. The Ascart House had few offspring, and they would only stay in the Holy Capital once in a while. There was no need to hire so many servants to wait on them.What the servants were needed for was the preservation of these historical items. It went without saying that nobles needed to have a fair share of antiques to flaunt their history too! This was a matter of dignity!The most incredible place of the Labyrinth Villa was probably the library, which contained many ancient books. Being fully aware of this, Roel led Nora over to the library and gestured to a set of books on the bookshelves.\u201cThe books you see over here are the diaries left behind by my predecessor, Ponte Ascart. You may feel free to flip through it, but please do pay heed since the paper is a little brittle.\u201dNora nodded her head obediently. As a future female successor as well, she carried great respect for Empress Victoria. Thus, she had a favorable impression of Ponte Ascart, who was known to have helped Empress Victoria through the crisis back then.This was a rare opportunity to read the diaries of Ponte Ascart, and a rare solemn look appeared on her face.Roel was relieved to see this since he would be able to take a breather with this. At the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but feel curious as to what was written in the diaries. Despite it having been some time since he arrived at the Labyrinth Villa, he hadn\u2019t actually read these yet. He assumed that the diaries were likely to be filled with boring work-related stuff, since Ponte Ascart was a high-standing official. Thus, he never bothered himself with them.With such thoughts in mind, he took out one of the diaries himself and began flipping through it.\u300c13th June, sunny.Uwoh, Victoria\u2019s little skirt looks so cute! It looks like the newest trend in the Holy Capital. There are many noblewomen who have been wearing such skirts recently, but in my opinion, Victoria is still the most beautiful of them all!\u300d\u300c14th June, sunny.Today\u2019s Victoria appears to be a little out-of-it. She seems to be bothered by something. I should have given her a stern scolding, but I can\u2019t bring myself to do it. Uwu, a brooding Victoria looks cute too!\u300dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026\u201cW-what\u2019s going on? This doesn\u2019t look right!Roel was taken aback. Even though he had only read two entries so far, it carried a strikingly similar style to some of the otaku-esque websites he had browsed through in the past.No, no no no no no. How can this be? My predecessor, Ponte Ascart, is a great hero! I\u2026 I\u2019ll read a bit more first\u2026\u300c24 August, rainy.It was raining when Victoria came by today. She got drenched along the way, resulting in her clothes clinging to her. Ahh, o\u2019 great Sia! Her body is still as small as a few years back. She doesn\u2019t have that unnecessary accumulation of fat on her chest. Her slender frame is truly a work of art! And oops, she caught me looking at her chest and glared at me. I must make sure to do it more discreetly in the future\u2026\u300dPah!The sound of a book slamming shut echoed loudly in the room, shocking Nora, who was reaching out to grab one of the diaries herself.\u201cRoel? What\u2019s wrong? Didn\u2019t you tell me to be more careful with these books?\u201dNora tilted her head in confusion at Roel\u2019s actions. The latter\u2019s cheeks were twitching a little. It took a while before he raised his head up once more with a light smile on his lips. With a tender voice, he said\u2026\u201cHm, what could be wrong here? We have spent quite some time walking around. Shall we head out to have some tea now?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t we going to read the diaries\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all work-related entries. There\u2019s nothing interesting to read about it. We have a tea set which Empress Victoria is very fond of. Aren\u2019t you interested in it?\u201dUnder Roel\u2019s coaxing, Nora\u2019s attention was successfully diverted, and the two of them left the library together. Before walking out, Roel shot a ferocious glare at the bookshelf.I\u2019ll burn you down tomorrow!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Flustered. Extremely flustered. And embarrassed too.The usual attitude Roel had with Nora was to \u2018stay as far away from me as possible\u2019, but today, he desperately tried to keep her by his side, not allowing her to stray from his line of sight at all.Ponte Ascart\u2019s diary entries were simply too detailed that Roel felt his fingers and toes curling up.

That fellow should really be thankful for Prince Wade\u2019s rebellion, or else he could have very well been executed by Victoria\u2026\u201d\u201cMm? What did you say?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing much. How is the tea?\u201d\u201cNot bad. The teacup is wonderful too. Empress Victoria has a good sense of aesthetics.\u201dSeeing how Nora was focused on other matters, Roel heaved a sigh of relief. It was fortunate that those from the royal palace rarely frequented this place. He would just have to survive these two days and send her off tomorrow night. It would all be good by then.The reputation of the Ascart House banks on everything that is going to happen today and tomorrow!Roel thought as his heart pounded furiously. He began putting together plans to keep Nora occupied.Meanwhile, after Nora finished studying the tea set, she turned to examine the door of the tea room, and she soon noticed something peculiar.\u201cWhat\u2019s that pinhole on the door?\u201d\u201cHm? Isn\u2019t that a door viewer?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking why there\u2019s a door viewer here. Isn\u2019t it something that\u2019s normally used only for the door at the entrance? I\u2019ve been paying close attention and noticed that almost every room in this villa has a door viewer. Is there some kind of special significance to this?\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s no special significance to it now. Just like what you have said, this door viewer is intended only for the entrance, but\u2026\u201dRoel revealed a rare gleeful smile as he pointed to the door of the tea room and explained.\u201c\u2026 every single door in the Labyrinth Villa is an entrance in itself.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dNora blinked her sapphire eyes in confusion as she tried to process what Roel was driving at. On the other hand, Roel also didn\u2019t keep her in suspense and revealed the deeper meaning behind his words.It was not just out of familiarity that Ponte Ascart chose the Labyrinth Villa as the place to bring Victoria Xeclyde to seek refuge. More than that, it was because the layout of this villa was compatible with the labyrinth artifact too.\u201cThe legendary labyrinth back in that era consists of two layers\u2014the inner layer consisting of the villa and the outer layer encompassing the streets and byways outside. The effect of the artifact veils the two layers in mist and partitions them into numerous sections. Whenever a person passes through the boundary of a section, he would be randomly teleported into another section. Unless the person enters the labyrinth in a specific manner at a specific timing, they will never be able to reach their destination. That\u2019s also why it was termed as a labyrinth.\u201cAs for the inner layer, it works in the same manner as the outer layer, just that the boundaries are the doors this time around, making every single one of them an \u2018entrance\u2019. I heard that huge, bulky metal doors were used back in that era, but they have already been replaced with the ordinary wooden doors you currently see. Nevertheless, we still kept the door viewers around for remembrance\u2019s sake.\u201dRoel\u2019s explanation expanded Nora\u2019s understanding of the Labyrinth Villa by a fair bit.\u201cIs it still possible to transform the villa into a labyrinth once more?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to construct the same massive labyrinth back in that era anymore, but if it\u2019s just limited to the interiors, it should still be doable.\u201dRoel replied as he recalled Carter telling him that a fragment of the family heirloom used back then still lingered within the labyrinth, granting it mystical powers.On the opposite end of the tea table, Nora looked at Roel, who was deep in thought, and she raised her teacup and took a sip. She seemed to be in a better mood than usual.(Affection Points +200!)For reasons unbeknownst to her, Roel was treating her much amicably than he usually did. At the very least, he wasn\u2019t intentionally trying to put distance between them. This placed her in a good mood.Nora was definitely not a masochist, and there was no way she would feel pleased when someone took on a perfunctory attitude with her. In fact, with her pride as a member of royalty, she wouldn\u2019t bother trying to know anyone who treated her in such a manner.In the end, the so-called \u2018boy you have won my interest through your cold attitude\u2019 plot device only worked in stories. Anyone who tried to emulate it in real life would only find themselves failing tragically.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe current relationship between Nora and Roel was more like buddies who knew each other\u2019s secrets, allowing them to show their true selves before one another. More importantly, while Roel tried to draw a line to distance himself from her, he had never snubbed her before.On top of that, it had been some time since Roel learned her secret, but he didn\u2019t seem to have any intention to use it as a chip to negotiate for a better position for himself or anything at all. In terms of character, he could still be considered as an upright person.If only he was willing to get close to me\u2026Nora sighed while sipping on her tea.To be honest, Roel was proving to be a far more difficult opponent to conquer than she initially thought. She really had no idea how that silver-haired girl managed to get so close to him.But while Nora envied Alicia, she was unaware that at this very moment, Alicia had just received news that the two of them would be spending the new year together in the villa, and she began crying out of indignance. Carter had to spend a great deal of effort consoling her before she finally calmed down.Roel spent the rest of the day on his toes, fearing that Nora would suddenly spark a newfound interest in looking at the diaries. This constant anxiety manifested into a grudge against his predecessors.Goddamnit! Those lazy bums must have never even flipped the cover on one of those diaries before, or how else could they allow such dark history to exist to this day? They even foolishly treated it as if it was a precious family heirloom! Please, that\u2019s a perverted lolicon over there!As frustrated as Roel was, he didn\u2019t dare to let it show out of fear of slipping up. As a result, this day ended up being the most harmonious day he had ever spent with Nora. The smile on Nora\u2019s lips lasted all the way till dinner.\u201cToday\u2019s cuisine is meticulously prepared too. I am confident that it\u2019ll satisfy your palate.\u201d\u201cI have no doubt in the food coming from the chefs of the Xeclyde House. Your food has never failed to delight me.\u201d\u201cIncluding that sweet?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that you enjoy our food. As a gesture of reciprocation, I would really appreciate it if you would just be a little more obedient.\u201d\u201cPardon me for being unable to fulfill your request.\u201dRoel unhesitatingly turned Nora down. The golden-haired girl clicked her tongue in dissatisfaction, but she didn\u2019t say too much about it.The dinner commenced under a fairly comfortable atmosphere. The location where they were dining wasn\u2019t the usual dining room table but a smaller table by the windowsill, allowing for a picturesque view of the vast scenery outside and a more intimate environment. There were also candles lit at the center of the table, adding to the mood.If they had been a little older, this could be considered a date.Roel\u2019s mind was still wandering around the area when a layer of red light suddenly cloaked his line of sight. A familiar burning sensation assaulted him once again. He immediately raised his hand and pressed it against his eyes in hopes of alleviating the pain.The sight alarmed Nora.\u201cRoel, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cI-it\u2019s nothing much. It\u2019s just that my eyes would suddenly hurt from time to time recently. I had it checked with the principal doctor of the Ascart House, but he wasn\u2019t able to find anything amiss.\u201dThe pain in Roel\u2019s eye left as quickly as it came. He rubbed his temples in frustration as he wondered if there were any ophthalmologists in this world.Nora was also reassured to see Roel\u2019s words tooHowever, what the two of them didn\u2019t know was that while Roel\u2019s eyes were hurting, the fragment of a multicolored gemstone glowed as if it had been awakened. A moment later, it reverted back to quietude.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 - I Trust You More Than You DoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63: I Trust You More Than You DoRoel felt that Nora was a good person.He believed that being able to have good food and sleep whenever one wanted to were the fundamental sources of bliss for humans, and anyone who was able to enhance this feeling of bliss for him was a good person.It was true that she did suffer from a slight streak of sadism, but no human is infallible. Roel felt that this much was at least understandable, especially with gourmet-level delicacies laid out before him.The cut of fish he was munching on had a soft and springy texture, giving it a fantastic bite. He felt that the chefs in this world really knew how to handle their ingredients. On top of the fundamental taste, aroma, and appearance, they were also able to perfect the mouthfeel of the food too. Without a doubt, this further accentuated the culinary experience.Back where Roel lived in his previous life, his countrymen were known to be extremely picky with their food. This was inevitable since there was plenty of affordable good food around. Roel wasn\u2019t born in a wealthy family in his previous life, but he did travel to many different places together with his parents. He had enjoyed hot pot on the mountains, succulent lamb on the plains, and fresh fish by the river. The desire for good food was already carved deep in his soul, a pursuit that he would never be able to escape from.While Roel was indulging himself in the sumptuous food before him, he didn\u2019t fail to notice that Nora appeared to be a little restrained during the meal. It seemed like something was bothering her. How did Roel notice it, you ask? It was through her appetite, of course!It should go without saying that the professional royal chefs wouldn\u2019t make a mistake as basic as portioning. Even a child like Roel wouldn\u2019t feel bloated after eating the full course. Perhaps Nora, as a girl, might not be able to eat as much as him, but there was no way she should be leaving so much good food behind.Looking at the dessert which Nora had only eaten a spoonful from, Roel blinked his eyes in confusion.What\u2019s going on? I thought that girls have a separate stomach for dessert? I can still understand if she isn\u2019t able to finish the main course, but she doesn\u2019t have an appetite for the dessert too?Is she on a diet? Is that even possible? I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve ever heard of an obese angel before. Could it be that her stomach is feeling unwell? Uhhh, doesn\u2019t seem too possible either. Those who possess bloodlines aren\u2019t that weak.Roel postulated many possibilities, but he was unable to figure out what was wrong with the girl. Taking a closer look at her face, it appeared that she was a little out of it.\u201cNora, what are you thinking of?\u201d\u201cHm? Nothing at all.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not nothing. You obviously have something on your mind. Look, you have barely eaten anything at all.\u201dRoel glanced at his own clean plate.His noble etiquette forbade him from asking for seconds despite relishing each dish. So, every single time he finished his portion, he was forced to suffer the agony of salivating over the delicacies left on Nora\u2019s plate.Tsk tsk, the royal family sure is extravagant!Roel was full of criticism for Nora\u2019s lavishness of wasting such good food, but there was no way he was going to say that aloud. He couldn\u2019t possibly put on an attitude after eating her food, right?However, what was surprising to Roel was how Nora didn\u2019t reveal her confident sadistic nature in response. Instead, there was a hesitant frown on her forehead, as if she was unable to find the words to describe her current feelings, or rather, this was the first time she was experiencing such a sensation.It felt like a distortion of her bloodline, as if someone was staring at her from an unknown place. She couldn\u2019t calm her palpitating heart at all, and unease seemed to ripple through her body. Even she herself had no idea what she was feeling so frightened of.She had heard from her elders that possessors of the Angel\u2019s Bloodline had the ability to foretell danger, but she had never experienced it before, so she had no idea whether her current feeling was a warning for danger. More importantly, she didn\u2019t think that it was possible for any danger to come to her and Roel given the current circumstances.She raised her head to look around her. Putting aside her personal maid, she had brought an entire platoon of royal guards together with her. Furthermore, the Ascart House also had its own platoon of guards protecting Roel too. All in all, there were at least 200 transcendents currently in the Labyrinth Villa.The sheer military power gathered here was more than enough to form a small army, not to mention that the soldiers within this small army were all elites. The security measures were on the dot too; there were guards patrolling every nook and cranny, and sentries were stationed every here and there.Even the rulers of smaller countries, whom Nora had met in Holy Capital Loren over the last few days, wouldn\u2019t be able to match this army. Even if an enemy were to somehow breach all of their forces, they still had an array of magic tools to protect themselves.The magic tools that the sole princess of the Theocracy and the sole successor of an eminent noble had were not to be scoffed at. Roel might not have had any enemies in the past, but after the affairs at the birthday banquet, Carter would surely hand him some invaluable magic tool in order to ensure his safety. It would be hard for any enemy to overcome their artifacts.And most importantly of all, they were currently in Loren, the headquarters of the Genesis Goddess Church. This was a place that was under the tight control of the Xeclyde House. If anything were to happen to Nora and Roel, reinforcements would arrive in at most five minutes.Nora didn\u2019t believe that there was anyone who would be willing to pit their strength against the Theocracy directly.\u201cAm I thinking too much?\u201dNora muttered while simultaneously placing her hand on her chest, attempting to still the pounding of her heart. She was able to reason out how irrational her fears were, but emotions weren\u2019t that easily convinced by logic. In the end, she still decided to ask about it.\u201cRoel, do you have any defensive magic tool to protect yourself with?\u201d\u201cMagic tool\u2026 Ah, you must be talking about this.\u201dRoel reached into his clothes and took out a purple crystal pendant.\u3010Seere\u2019s Guardian StoneA magic tool created by Great Scholar Seere from the Country of Scholars, Brolne. It\u2019s able to withstand multiple attacks from a high-level transcendent.\u3011This was an artifact that Carter handed over to Roel after the birthday banquet. While its ability to withstand multiple attacks from a high-level transcendent appeared to be pretty useful in combat, in truth, it was highly unlikely for one to be assassinated by high-level transcendents.Those who were at Origin Level 3 and above were already the top leaders of a country. Putting aside the fact that it was unlikely for them to head out and attempt to assassinate another person, even if they did, their targets were likely to be of equally prestigious standing as themselves. Besides, they would have subordinates who specialized in assassination, and they were likely to be more skilled than them in this.Most importantly of all though, if a high-level transcendent were to really set their eyes on them, there was no way they could escape from the other party with just a couple of magic tools.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve been wearing it all this while. Is there a problem? \u2026 Or do you suspect that we are in danger?\u201dRoel frowned. Given how Nora had been suffering from a poor appetite and brooding throughout the meal, he couldn\u2019t help but think further into the matter.Nora, on the other hand, pondered for a moment before finally revealing the unease in her heart.\u201cI don\u2019t really know how to describe this feeling. It\u2019s like I\u2019m a prey eyed by a stronger predator, a soldier who had an arrow nocked and aimed at him, a slave who was soon to be stepped upon\u2026\u201dWhat is with that final metaphor there?!Roel retorted in his mind and his face twitched slightly at that bizarre comparison. However, Nora\u2019s words also made him understand how severe the situation was.\u201cIt\u2019s just a feeling that I have. I don\u2019t have any evidence backing it up, so it could have just been a whimsical mood shift, so\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I believe you.\u201dNora raised her head to look at Roel with widened eyes, and she saw the graveness on his face. It was clear that he was taking her feelings very seriously.(Affection Points +200!)The feeling of having her unfounded worries acknowledged surprisingly embarrassed her as her face blushed furiously. She was unexpectedly happy about this.On the other hand, Roel\u2019s mood grew incredibly heavy.Nora\u2019s nervousness was definitely no joking matter. She was a possessor of the Angel\u2019s Bloodline, which was known for its sharp intuition for danger. It was a feeling reminiscent of the legendary woman\u2019s intuition. It would be foolish to brush away her unease easily.As for evidence\u2026 was there really a need for there to be evidence every single time in order to move?In any case, Roel immediately leaped off his chair, grabbed Nora\u2019s hand, and began leaving the room. While taking his leave, he also quickly issued several instructions to the servants and guards, which basically consisted of tightening the security and preparing for battle at any moment. That was not all. He even grabbed the emergency communication tool of the Ascart House, readying himself to ask for reinforcement from his father and the church as soon as any danger presented itself!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 - Night of the DemonsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64: Night of the DemonsIn a dimly-lit castle, there existed a secret room behind a hidden entrance. In this room, an austere golden-haired man was seated at one end of a long table, staring at a painting that was floating before him. A crease was slowly forming between his brows.A month had passed, and the prophetic oil painting had changed greatly from when Bryan first saw it. If what he had viewed before was an inferior work created by an artist\u2019s whim, then now it had indubitably become a masterpiece created under the hands of a skilled painter, a work to be marveled.The boy and girl in the painting, who were previously nearly indistinguishable, were now depicted with realistic vividness, and the surrounding buildings had all sharpened in clarity.This was good news. It symbolized that the date of fulfillment of the foretold prophecy was ticking close, and the variables surrounding the event were lessening. Soon, the boy from the Ascarts and the girl from the Xeclydes would fall into danger.However, Bryan had another view regarding this matter. He had learned a lesson from his previous failure with prophecy.\u201cThis painting doesn\u2019t depict their death, which means that the conclusion is uncertain.\u201dBryan muttered coldly as the crease between his brows deepened.Truthfully, he wasn\u2019t too optimistic about the prophecy. Sitting at the opposite end of a long table, an enigmatic figure known as the Collector chuckled upon hearing those words.\u201cYou\u2019re right. Still, if the painting has been completed to this degree, they won\u2019t be able to escape the ill fate that awaits them.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s the one making a move?\u201d\u201cThe Mythril Priory. Of course, there could be other powers behind them too. They proposed a collaboration with us, but I declined.\u201d\u201cDeclined?\u201dFor the first time, Bryan spoke with a hint of doubt. He looked at the silhouette hidden in the darkness before him, hoping to peer into the man\u2019s true intentions. Seeing this, the Collector explained.\u201cThey don\u2019t stand a good chance. They are going for the Ascarts and Xeclydes together. Houses with long lineages are a variable, and dealing with one is already a huge hassle. The risks from dealing with two simultaneously are too great.\u201cStill, to express our stance, I dispatched a precious staff of ours to assist them. It\u2019ll at least correct some of the imperfections in their plans and raise the chances of success.\u201d\u201cWhat about this painting?\u201d\u201cI have shown it to them. They don\u2019t think that it\u2019s an omen of failure. There are those amongst them who don\u2019t believe in our prophecies, and some think that it\u2019s an opportunity. I\u2019d imagine that the streets of the Holy Capital depicted in this painting are currently filled with their men.\u201dThe tone of the Collector grew lighter and more joyous the further he spoke, perhaps carrying a hint of mockery too. Bryan listened to the news about the collusions and conflicts amongst the various evil cults impassively, his eyes focused only on the painting ahead of him. There was something about it that was drawing his attention.Naturally, this caught the Collector\u2019s attention. The chuckle halted, and a curious voice sounded.\u201cYou have been staring at this painting for a long time now. Why so? It\u2019s rare to see you getting so interested in something. Is it that boy?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Not exactly. He does intrigue me, but the location feels oddly familiar to me.\u201dBryan stared at the streets depicted in the painting as the crease between his brows refused to unfurl.It was an old street built in a classic manner. Judging from the surrounding buildings, it didn\u2019t seem to be located in the noble sector. It would have been easier to find it if it had been in any other city in the Theocracy, but there were simply too many streets that looked alike to this in the Capital.Having enjoyed centuries of peace, there were simply too many ancient buildings with hundreds of years of history behind them. Old and classic weren\u2019t distinguishing traits but commonplace.With such thoughts in mind, Bryan dispelled his doubts. It wouldn\u2019t be odd for anyone who had been to the older sectors within the Holy Capital to find the scenery depicted in the painting familiar. So, he shook his head and turned his attention back to the long table. He stared at the teacup in front of him contemplatively for a few moments before he raised his head.\u201cWhat about the Genesis Goddess Church? There\u2019s no way to circumvent him if anyone tries to pull something in Loren.\u201dBryan didn\u2019t reveal the name of the person, but the Collector still understood who he was referring to.The Holy Eminence, the protector of Holy Capital Loren.Evil cults wreaked havoc everywhere else on the Sia Continent, but there was one place which they would try to avoid if possible\u2014the Theocracy, especially the Holy Capital. If they had no choice but to go to the Holy Capital, they would do their best to humble themselves and appear invisible.Even though everyone was aware that he could see them.No one could escape his sight. That was why everyone could only bend their backs lower and lower, till the point where he couldn\u2019t be bothered to deal with them anymore.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the Mythril Priory are thinking, but they must have made a deal with that man. It has been some time since their establishment, and while they have been lying low thus far, they do have quite a developed intelligence network. I believe that the things they have to offer are substantial, which is why I chose to offer them a little bit of help.\u201dThe Collector revealed his intentions behind this matter.The crux here lay not in participation but to avoid getting sold out by the Mythril Hermits as chips for negotiation. They were taking on a more conservative, defensive position.Bryan nodded and replied.\u201cThe Mythril Priory has been away from the Theocracy for far too long. The Theocracy isn\u2019t like Rosa; it\u2019s no easy feat to thrive here. Sia\u2019s light does exist in this place. However, our friends don\u2019t seem to understand this.\u201dHe could finally see why the Collector appeared to be gloating over their imminent failure.As the country controlled by the Genesis Goddess Church, the number of evil cults operating within the Saint Mesit Theocracy had always been the lowest amongst all countries. There was hardly any news about them at all. As such, it was inevitable that the cults operating outside would think that their counterparts in the Theocracy were weak and incompetent.They couldn\u2019t be more wrong.Under the focused suppression by the Theocracy, any smaller cults would swiftly meet their end. This meant that these cults had no choice but to ally together in order to protect themselves. There were some who chose to leave the Theocracy and make their name elsewhere, but similarly, there were also behemoths that chose to lurk under the shadows cast by the most radiant light.And the Connoisseur Guild was one of the organizations that chose the latter.\u201cLet them do what they want. They\u2019re at least qualified to serve as a stepping stone.\u201dThe Collector slowly placed his goblet back onto the table.It\u2019s going to be a long night.\u2026Classifying strength in Sia was not an easy feat.It was commonly known that the factor that played the largest role in determining one\u2019s strength was one\u2019s Origin Level. To use a metaphor, it was like a generator that determined how much power one was able to exert.With sufficient strength, one could do anything. The higher one\u2019s Origin Level was, the more mana one could exert at once. A massive accumulation of mana would bring about a qualitative change in its nature. Similar spells cast using varying amounts of mana could bring about massive differences that were not just limited to scale and power.The next factor would be one\u2019s Origin Attribute. It was the core system that determined a transcendent\u2019s abilities.That would be pretty much it for ordinary transcendents, but there was a group of blessed individuals who were bestowed with another trump card\u2014bloodlines. Each bloodline possessor commanded a unique power. Some were granted a single ability; some were granted multiple abilities too. Regardless of which, the abilities granted through bloodlines were often terrifyingly strong.Tapping into one\u2019s bloodline ability was not without cost; on the contrary, they often came with severe side effects. Nevertheless, most bloodline abilities could generate a force that transcended the laws of the world.Take Skin Grafter Peter Kater for example, he was one of the rare humans who possessed a lower Silver Bloodline. The requirements to activate his bloodline ability was extreme, and the price of activation was so great that he literally couldn\u2019t pay it himself. Nevertheless, if used in the right circumstances, it could prove to be an invaluable asset.Peter Kater\u2019s bloodline ability was called Personal Studio. It could only be activated indoors, and there was a cooldown time of three years. On top of that, he had to take the lives of a hundred people as a tribute. For all of these conditions, the effect of his bloodline ability was surprisingly simple\u2014he could isolate himself and everyone else with him within a room from the rest of the world for a single day.Of course, he wasn\u2019t paying such a heavy price for nothing. Personal Studio had the ability to nullify all magic tools, be it protective artifacts or communication devices. It was a mini world that forbade disturbances from the world beyond it.It was easy to think that his bloodline ability, which didn\u2019t augment his fighting prowess but had a long cooldown time, was both inconvenient and lacking, but it was perfect for assassinating high-ranking nobles who lacked fighting prowess by themselves.It was precisely due to this that Peter, despite being only at Origin Level 4, was able to rise to a significant position within the Mythril Priory, enjoying an extravagant lifestyle. Today, as the representative of the Mythril Priory, he, together with his co-conspirators, would be attempting one of the highest level assassinations that the Sia Continent had ever seen before\u2026Compared to the powerful fief lords and even kings of minor countries that he had assassinated in the past, Peter\u2019s assassination target this time around, Roel Ascart, was someone exceedingly minor. The other party was merely a 10-year-old brat who didn\u2019t even have a noble title!To be honest, Peter didn\u2019t understand why he had to use his invaluable ability on someone of this caliber, but he dared not go against the orders of the leader.\u201cI\u2019ll insert you into the room they are in, but I won\u2019t be able to confirm the timing. Roel Ascart could be alone by himself, or he could be with the princess of the Theocracy too. However, you can be assured that there will be no more than three people. Remember this, you can only kill one person. Once a person is dead, you\u2019ll be teleported right back to your original position.\u201d\u201cSo, why do we have to make a move within these two days? That princess wouldn\u2019t be around on any other day, and there would be fewer guards, right?\u201dThe black-haired, pale-faced Peter looked at the nervous well-built man, who was holding onto an axe, and posed his doubt. The well-built man shot him a look without saying a word, but Peter still managed to catch his drift and clicked his tongue in annoyance.Bloodline abilities came hand-in-hand with restrictions and side effects; no bloodline possessor was exempted from that rule. There were bound to be even tighter restrictions for this man, who was able to overcome all the barriers surrounding the villa and accurately \u2018insert\u2019 him in.Is it the new year? Or is it the alignment of the stars?, Peter wondered.Before Peter could say a word, the well-built man had already begun his move. He raised the sleeve on one of his arms to reveal his scar-filled flesh, before raising his axe high and hacking down on it.Amidst a stifled scream of pain, Peter watched as the man\u2019s arm fell to the ground, but shockingly, what flowed out of his wound wasn\u2019t blood but crimson magic power. The bizarre magic power swiftly shrouded Peter before disappearing together with him.\u2026\u201cWhere did this letter come from?\u201dIn the headquarters of the Genesis Goddess Church, the Holy Eminence, John Xeclyde, who had just finished meeting the kings from smaller countries, looked at the priest standing before him and asked. The latter was respectfully offering an envelope with three feathers to him with both hands.The three white-feathered envelope was a gesture of surrender that was initiated by the countries that had been invaded by the Ancient Austine Empire during the Second Epoch. It eventually spread across all of the human countries, and it continued to be used even to this day.Any envoy who carried a three white-feathered envelope was viewed to be inviolable and mustn\u2019t be harmed.Typically speaking, the envelope would only appear between warring countries, but the situation was a little peculiar for the Theocracy. It was common knowledge that the Theocracy was not at war with any country, which meant that the envelope could have only come from one source\u2014the evil cults.Sometimes, when an evil cult or a hostile power was no longer able to withstand the pressure from the Theocracy anymore, they would deliver such an envelope over as a symbol of surrender. Usually, they would offer some intelligence or compensation to the Theocracy in exchange for a peaceful exile to somewhere remote, or possibly, even migrating to the empire or other countries that were hostile to the Theocracy to stir trouble.The Theocracy usually took on a more peaceful approach toward such surrenders too.John Xeclyde knew full well that a country needed to have flexible diplomacy in order to thrive. Destroying all evil was nothing more than an ideal. Taking on an unyielding stance against evil cults could very well backfire on the Theocracy.\u201cThe young rascals found it in the wishing box in the square earlier today. Your Eminence, will you be taking a look at it?\u201d\u201cMm, I\u2019ll take a look at it. You may back down now.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Eminence.\u201dJohn took the envelope before dismissing everyone within the room. He infused his magic power into the envelope, and the three white feathers immediately rose into the air to form a triangular screen. This was the method to view the content of the envelope.It was a little similar to the modern day video conferencing tool. It was a safe, efficient, and confidential way for hostile powers to communicate with one another. It was just that it expended a significant amount of magic power, and it could only be activated by the intended recipient.\u201cGood day to you, the esteemed Holy Eminence of the Theocracy. I am the vice leader of the Mythril Priory, Caras. I offer you my sincere greetings.\u201dOn the screen, a gentleman that resembled a noble placed his fist on his chest and bowed deeply to John Xeclyde. In such a manner, the two of them began their conversation.\u2026Meanwhile, in the Labyrinth Villa, Nora and Roel found themselves in an utterly baffling situation. They were in the library browsing through some books a moment ago when a mystical pulsation of magic power caused their surroundings to change immensely.Nora suddenly felt her bloodline ability jolting violently, as if she had encountered a hostile enemy. On the other hand, Roel\u2019s head also began to hurt once more.What is going on? This scenery looks like\u2026 Damn it, my head hurts too much!The abrupt change in the situation left Roel with no choice but to bear with the excruciating pain and scan his surroundings. Standing right in front of them was a black-haired man, who was observing them intently. A light red aura was swiftly diffusing from above him, suffusing the air with a sickly sweet stench of blood.Skin Grafter, Peter Kater.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - The Angel\u2019s DecisionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 65: The Angel\u2019s DecisionPeter Kater was in a terrible mood at the moment.Such horrible luck.That well-built man from the Connoisseur Guild had indeed sent him in, and he knew beforehand that this mission was going to be like drawing a lottery.The best result for him was for Roel Ascart to be all alone. He could swiftly get the job done and retreat as quickly as possible. It would have also been fine if Roel was with a random guard. Under such circumstances, as long as the guard wasn\u2019t too powerful, he should still be able to take care of the situation quickly.As for the worst possible scenario, it was for Roel Ascart and Nora Xeclyde to be together with one another. The members of the Xeclyde House, possessors of the Angel\u2019s Bloodline, were not people who could be dealt with easily.\u2018Don\u2019t play schemes with the Xeclyde House, this was a common consensus amongst all of the evil cults in Sia.Several centuries ago, there was a powerful cult that had reached the peak of its influence back then that attempted to challenge that consensus. They assassinated a member of the Xeclyde House. The result of their actions was an unyielding pursuit with utterly no regard for the cost that lasted for a whole forty years.Over the forty years, the cult traveled across all of the human countries and even tried hiding in the depths of a remote mountain range. However, no matter where they went, they were never able to hide from the eyes of the church. It felt like a sword was forever floating above their heads, threatening to sever their necks as soon as they tried to rest.Just like that, a group that once boasted over 10,000 transcendents was utterly massacred to the final cultist over the course of forty years. Through its actions, the church gave a stern warning to all cults and rival powers,If you want a fight, come at us straight-on. If we lose, we\u2019ll admit our defeat. However, if you wish to play the assassination game with us and threaten our lineage, then we\u2019ll use the full power of the Genesis Goddess Church to decimate you. You can run wherever you want, but you\u2019ll never be free.It was fortunate that Peter\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t Nora, so his fate wouldn\u2019t be as tragic as that ancient cult. Based on the directives he had received from his superiors, he just had to temporarily keep Nora under control, so that he could kill Roel Ascart before making his getaway.But, of course, things weren\u2019t so easy in practice.First and foremost, it would be hard to keep Nora under control without injuring her. If he really did injure her, the Xeclydes might very well have some sort of peculiar means up their sleeves to track him down. Even if he was able to make a getaway now, what about in the future then? Was he going to spend his life wandering all around the world as a wanted fugitive once Nora came to power?Peter was not a fool. He had a clear idea of the pros and cons of what he was doing. He was willing to carry out the mission entrusted to him by his superiors, but that was under the pretext that the risks and rewards were reasonable.Having thought this far, he looked at the two children before him. They were still shocked by the abrupt situation, and a scheme began to surface in Peter\u2019s mind. He would make a bid for his survival.\u201cA good day to the two friends that we have here. Pardon me for my abrupt visit. I am a disciple of the Mythril Priory. I have come under the orders of my superior to take one of your lives.\u201cYou\u2019re currently in the space I have created with my bloodline ability, a studio that\u2019s isolated from the rest of the world. You can give it a try, but I can assure you that any magic tools you have are rendered powerless here. There\u2019s only one way to escape from this space, and it\u2019s for one of you to die.\u201cI don\u2019t care which of you the person is, but blood must be shed. Thus, I would like to offer a proposal\u2014why don\u2019t the two of you fight it out to decide on the survivor?\u201dPeter Kater spoke with a brilliant smile on his face, reminiscent of a devil enticing humans to sin. He reshaped reality for the two children through the lies he weaved into his words.\u201cI can assure you that I\u2019ll only kill the person who loses the duel. I won\u2019t touch a single hair on the head of the winner.\u201dHe calmly explained to the two children the rules of this place, and he reasoned that he hadn\u2019t wanted to come here either. He was forced to make a move by his superiors of the Mythril Priory, and it was out of his benevolence that one of them would be able to get out of here alive.He expressed that he was very conflicted about having to choose between two precious lives. In order to be fair, he decided to entrust the decision to them, which was also the reason why he proposed this competition.After saying his piece, Peter Kater stood calmly to the side as he watched the two children with a smug smile, as if he had just done something noble. The distorted portraits hung within the room revealed sinister smiles as well, and a jarring cackling that seemed to have come from the demons of hell reverberated loudly in the room.Faced with such a situation, the faces of the two children turned pale.Yes, this is more like it.Peter Kater observed the scared-stiff young duo before him as he ridiculed them in his mind.He believed that greed is an inherent nature of humans. A good upbringing and education could erase some traces of it, but similarly, it was possible to construct situations that exacerbate it too.The tool that Peter used was fear. Humans tended to lose their rational judgment in the face of fear, making them more self-centered and egotistical. In this competition-like scenario that he had created, he had made himself out to be the one in authority who was leveraging a deal between the two of them. Everyone else here was nothing more than prey.In the space he had constructed, one\u2019s standing and position no longer meant anything at all. Even humble coachmen would slaughter the noblemen they served for a chance at survival, let alone an esteemed princess of the Xeclydes.With Nora Xeclyde\u2019s superior strength, she would be able to kill Roel in his stead.While Peter was thinking such thoughts in his mind, the two children had finally fully digested the information that he had thrown at them.Roel clasped the pendant he had received from Carter in his hands and attempted to infuse mana into it, but there was no reaction. He withstood his headache and turned to look at Nora, only to see that the latter was checking her magic tools too.To their astonishment, Peter\u2019s words were true. Roel could hardly believe the situation he was in. He couldn\u2019t understand how this fellow managed to circumvent all of their guards to get to them, and he had no idea what this room they were in was either.He was also oblivious that he was faced with the combined prowess of two powerful organizations, a line-up that was usually used to assassinate powerful nobles and even kings. He also had no idea why he was eyed by the Mythril Priory organization either.However, there was one thing that he did know despite his ignorance.You\u2019re only going to kill the loser? Hah, a heap of bullshit!Looking at the deep crimson light that was flashing above Peter\u2019s head, Roel knew that the man standing before him was definitely not a trustworthy individual. He had cast the Calamity of Bloodshed, a spell he had bought from the Gold Coin Shop that helped him discern who carried killing intent toward him.One thing that he was surprised to discover about the spell was that there were actually different classifications based on the intensity of the colors.A light red color meant \u2018An enemy has revealed his killing intent, but you aren\u2019t his primary target\u2019. A normal red color meant \u2018An enemy has directed his killing intent right at you\u2019. A dark red color meant \u2018An enemy carries great killing intent toward you, and you\u2019re his primary target\u2019.The current situation was the third one, which meant that the enemy was specifically out to kill him!This made Roel deeply worried, but at the same time, a sliver of doubt surfaced in his mind.Doesn\u2019t this mean that Nora is uninvolved in this matter? If so, why did the enemy still come up with such a proposal?Roel pondered for a moment, but in the end, he could only attribute it to the other party being unwilling to make a move by himself for some sort of reason. Nevertheless, the proposal he had made was indeed rather vile.\u2018Do not ever put a person\u2019s humanity to the test\u2019, this was a saying that Roel had often heard in his previous life. Humans could be noble, but they were fallible too. Their natures were not constant. Rather, they changed themselves to fit the situation.Roel took a look at the eerie room filled with all sorts of distorted, dancing portraits. Those faces that had seven empty holes where their eyes, nostrils, ears, and mouth should be really challenged Roel\u2019s tolerance. He felt revulsion.Nora was indeed a good person, but she was still young. Would she really be able to think rationally under this terrifying situation, when her life was threatened by another?Roel didn\u2019t know the answer to this question. He raised his gaze to look at her, only to be faced with her sapphire eyes. Silence lingered between the two of them as Roel tried to make out her thoughts, but he couldn\u2019t discern anything from her impassive face.But, all of a sudden, Nora stood up and pounced on him.\u201cHey! You\u2026\u201dThe abrupt twist in the situation made Roel exclaim in horror, but before he could finish his sentence, Nora was already right before him. He reflexively reached for Ascendwing, but to his surprise, the princess did something different than what he had expected.She reached out to grab his hands before pulling him behind her. Her impassive eyes finally revealed a hint of emotion. She gave the assassin a piercing look, her head raised in a dignified manner.\u201cYou want us to fight it out? Dream on.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 - The Radiant OnePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 66: The Radiant OneWords couldn\u2019t describe how Roel felt when Nora unfurled her wings of light and shielded him behind her.He had considered many possibilities. Perhaps Nora would attack him; perhaps she would try to communicate with him peacefully; perhaps she might try to put some distance between them to guard against him; perhaps she would feel desperate, with no choice but to kill him.However, he never imagined that Nora would actually show her back to him.While Roel didn\u2019t possess an Origin Attribute, he was not completely powerless. On the contrary, he definitely bore a means that could heavily injure Nora\u2014the Ascendwing Short Sword.This was a weapon that Nora had activated for him, and it allowed him to easily breach the defenses of an Origin Level 5 transcendent. If Roel had set his mind to betray her right now, she would be utterly defenseless given the close range. By daring to give him her back, she was displaying her full trust.It was true that Nora had been good to him all this while, but he never thought that she would go to such an extent for him. Was she confident of defeating the enemy standing before them?No, that wasn\u2019t it. Roel had no idea what trump cards Nora had up her sleeves, but he was able to sense some of her emotions. It was nearly indiscernible, but the hand she was holding his with was trembling. She was definitely not as calm as she portrayed herself to be at the moment.Nevertheless, given that they were suddenly shoved into this dark and sinister art studio, surrounded by terrifying paintings that really left one nauseated, her current performance had already far exceeded Roel\u2019s expectations.There was another person who was equally surprised, Peter Kater. He never thought that the mind games that he was skilled at would instead actually further affirm the young girl\u2019s will to stand against him.\u201cPrincess of the Xeclydes, you seem to carry some misunderstandings toward us. You deem us as evil cults who ought to be put to death, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re mindless butcherers who go around causing meaningless deaths.\u201cI have a good idea of both of your strengths. Your Highness, I am confident of defeating you with an overwhelming advantage if you challenge me to a battle. If you\u2019re worried that I\u2019ll renege on my promise and take your life after killing that boy over there, you need not be. If I wished to, I could have taken both your lives already. There\u2019s no need for me to propose such a roundabout manner of doing things.\u201dAfter hearing the long speech coming from the assassin, Nora looked at him calmly and replied with a few snappy words.\u201cAre you done speaking?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI, Nora Xeclyde, as the successor of the royal family, am born with great responsibilities on my shoulders. When it comes to work, Roel is my subordinate. As his liege, I am duty-bound to protect him. When it comes to private relationships, Roel is my close friend. I am obliged to respect and stand up for him.\u201cI am his guardian, and I\u2019ll shield him from unreasonable harm that others seek to inflict on him. This is the responsibility that I, as a Xeclyde, bear. Are you asking me to put down my responsibilities and my pride to collude with the likes of you? Don\u2019t insult me.\u201dNora\u2019s forceful words stunned Roel. It felt like he was finally catching a glimpse of the charisma she had before her loyal group of followers. He opened his mouth, but he had no idea what he should say. All he could feel was the dryness of his throat.The saying \u2018Subordinates will put their lives on the line for those who recognize their worth\u2019\u2026 wasn\u2019t exactly appropriate for this situation. That being said, Nora\u2019s attitude did move Roel. The interweaving rays of light behind her back looked glorious, but they were nothing compared to the light she held in her heart.On the other hand, Peter Kater fell into a rage hearing her declaration. From his perspective, he felt that there was something very wrong with Nora\u2019s head.\u201cCompetition is the natural way of the world. It\u2019s those who adapt who survive. What\u2019s wrong with the strong killing the weak?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s due to your primitive, beastlike mindsets that you are deemed as evil cultists. You think nothing of human lives and challenge the order of society. You undermine the progress that we have made throughout the years and seek to destroy civilization.\u201d\u201cHaa. Very well. Perhaps those are the honest thoughts you stand by, but what about him?\u201dPeter glanced at the black-haired boy, trying to sow internal discord with a sinister smile on his face.\u201cHe nearly drew his sword on you earlier. The relationship between the two of you looks pretty one-sided to me.\u201d\u201cHis fear only goes to show his lack of understanding toward me. We\u2019ll have plenty of time later to get to know one another better.\u201dAs Nora said those words, she glanced backward to shoot a piercing glare toward Roel, causing the latter to scratch his head awkwardly. However, she didn\u2019t continue faulting him for that. Instead, she turned back to face their enemy.\u201cThank you for your warning. We\u2019ll be closer than ever in the future. However, we don\u2019t need you to question our relationship.\u201dNora\u2019s words made Peter Kater widen his eyes. Incomprehension was written all over his face.What in the world was with that Roel brat? How in the world did he manage to win over the successor of the Xeclydes? Why is she so protective of him?!He was starting to feel a little frenzied at the situation. He exhaled deeply as he thought to himself that there was a need to plunge these two brats deeper into despair.\u201cIs that so? Fine. Let\u2019s not talk about these for now. Why don\u2019t I introduce my paintings to you first?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI might be a transcendent, but I\u2019m first and foremost an artist. This studio contains all of my work to date. There aren\u2019t many people who have the privilege to enjoy my masterpieces. Well, let\u2019s start with this one then!\u201dWith a snap of his fingers, a portrait painted with gruesome colors that emanated a horrible stench floated up to him from behind. He turned around and stared lovingly at the portrait as he began to excitedly explain the concept behind his painting, as if he was a curator in a museum.\u201cHave a good look at this, it\u2019s mymagnum opus! Painters nowadays are only out to create a sensation for fame. Their so-called masterpieces are all form and no soul. Disappointing! Look at the empty eyes of the characters they create! Look at their empty and soulless pieces! They\u2019re a desecration to true art!\u201cSo, I set out on a long journey to seek the way to creating the most vivid painting, and voila! I finally found it! In the midst of my journey, I stumbled upon a pregnant mother breastfeeding her child. There was such a loving smile on her face when she gazed upon her child while stroking her protruding stomach. She must have been wondering what her second child would look like. It was such a moving sight that I found myself trembling with the desire to eternalize this scene\u2026 so, I killed her.\u201dPeter Kater revealed a tender smile as he reminisced about his past with nostalgia, but the words he spoke left Nora and Roel stunned.\u201cWhat\u2026 did you say?\u201d\u201cI killed her and her child. I used their flesh and blood to create this portrait, \u2018Smiling Mother\u2019. Look at her beautiful figure and her soul. This is what I call true art! She\u2019s my muse!\u201dPeter opened his arms gracefully, as if he was enjoying the cheers from a crowd of his admirers. However, all Roel and Nora could hear were screams of agony within the studio. Countless poor spirits were drifting amidst the darkness, screaming at Peter\u2019s inhumane actions. Yet, the culprit only breathed out relaxedly, as if enjoying all of this.He looked at the two pale-faced children and almost wanted to laugh to himself.They\u2019re brats after all. All it takes are a few words to frighten them.The smug assassin waved his hand, and the mother depicted in the painting crawled out from the frame and coiled herself around his body.\u201cYour Highness, you should know deep down that the two of you aren\u2019t a match for me. If you insist on making me your enemy, I don\u2019t mind adding the portrait of an angel to my collection.\u201dThe pale black-haired man looked into Nora\u2019s sapphire eyes.\u201cYou would make a perfect painting. Your blood will paint beautiful strokes of red and black, and your bones will be ground to form yellow and white. I\u2019ll use a real angel to create a painting of an angel. Ah\u2026 that would make a marvelous painting, wouldn\u2019t it? I might even be able to rise to Origin Level 3.\u201cBut, if you change your mind and stop protecting that brat, I\u2019ll let you off. I don\u2019t need too many dead bodies in my studio. I just need one person for my colors. You\u2019ll be able to return safely back to your world.\u201dPeter said as he looked at the 10-year-old girl with his lips curled up. He waited patiently for her response.He knew that Nora was no fool. She was acutely aware of the differences in their strength. If so, what he had to do was to create a scenario where she could self-justify her betrayal, and the best way to do so was to render her helpless. As long as she felt that she had no choice but to do his bidding, she would be able to toss aside that self-righteousness of hers and act as he intended her to.Peter had used this method many times before, so he knew that humans weren\u2019t as mentally resilient as most thought they were. One simply had to push the right buttons in order to make a person follow one\u2019s bidding.He assailed Nora both logically and emotionally, but such a pity it was that he didn\u2019t get what he wanted. What he received wasn\u2019t a compromise but the mocking of the princess.\u201cCompassion, kindness, and impartiality. These are the values that we Xeclydes embrace. It\u2019s the moral compass that we hold in our hearts. You don\u2019t even know this much, and you still wish to make a painting out of me using my flesh and blood?\u201cDid you think that I would be afraid of you? I might die, but our lineage would never end. A day will come where the sword of a Xeclyde will pierce through your throat. The deceased will finally be able to rest in peace, and the living will be able to live without fear. Justice may be late but never absent. The only fate that awaits you is destruction!\u201dNora glared unyieldingly at the enemy before her as she spoke words that affirmed her heart. Roel was moved by her speech too. He felt that even though she had yet to fully unfurl her wings, she had already shown herself to be a true angel who stood steadfast in her beliefs.\u2026While Nora and Roel were standing against Peter, Holy Eminence John was also in the midst of negotiation with the vice leader of the Mythril Priory.\u201cAs you have demanded, we\u2019ll leave the Theocracy and guarantee that none of our members will ever appear in the vicinity of the Theocracy anymore. On top of that, we\u2019ll provide you with the intelligence of eleven targets on your hit list.\u201dThe refined man respectfully listed the concessions he was willing to make for a peace treaty between the Theocracy and the Mythril Priory, from offering valuable intelligence regarding other evil cults to dealing with the underlying threats that were endangering the Theocracy. It was almost as if he was viewing himself as a stout ally of the Theocracy.The white-haired old man fell silent while listening to the other party\u2019s words. A long time later, he finally asked the most important question.\u201cSo, what do you hope to obtain?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. We just hope that you can turn a blind eye to this incident,\u201d said Caras calmly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 - The Path of JusticePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 67: The Path of JusticeCaras\u2019 voice echoed loudly within the massive hall, but what awaited him wasn\u2019t the words of approval he expected but a lengthy silence. While he hadn\u2019t explicitly mentioned whatthat incidentreferred to, Holy Eminence John still understood what he was referring to.Within Holy Capital Loren, there was no transcendent who could escape from John\u2019s eyes and defy his will. He was fully aware of everything that was going on. This was also the reason why Carter felt assured leaving Roel alone in the capital.Needless to say, the Mythril Priory knew it too, which was why they had headed over to negotiate with John on this matter. They hoped to obtain John\u2019s implicit approval by offering him benefits that he couldn\u2019t reject.\u201cWe won\u2019t hurt the offspring of the Xeclydes, and we dare not do so either. We can give you our assurance on that. We also understand the current political situation in the Theocracy, so we have already made preparations for the cleanup. Roel Ascart will not die in Loren. Everything is nothing more than an accident. The Ascart House will not be able to find any evidence to hold against the royal family.\u201cIf you are still worried about that, we can even help you hold back the Elric House to a certain degree. At the very least, we\u2019ll be able to buy ten years for the royal family.\u201cOur target is not the Ascart House but the prophesied son. The current patriarch of the Ascart House, Carter Ascart, is still in his prime, and he still has the ability to pass down his bloodline. The Ascart House will not be without a successor. Chaos and imbalance will also not occur amongst the Five Eminent Noble Houses.\u201dCaras\u2019 respectful and humble voice echoed loudly in the hall.Without a doubt, the Mythril Priory had made ample preparations for this operation. The cleanup they had proposed was near perfect, such that any negative influence on the Theocracy would be reduced to the very minimum. On the contrary, the Theocracy and the royal family had much to earn from accepting this deal.Any rational man would know what to choose after weighing the pros and cons, not to mention that the Xeclydes was a massive noble house. Caras was still very confident in the terms that their Mythril Priory had offered.It was true that John Xeclyde was the Holy Eminence, but more than that, he was also the patriarch of the Xeclyde House.A noble house couldn\u2019t just survive on one\u2019s hot-bloodedness and emotions. More often than not, it was the composure and rationality to make the hard choices that maximized the house\u2019s interests and brought about the best outcome. Such choices came at a cost. Sometimes, it meant fracturing kinship and severing friendship.If one thought that serving as the patriarch of a noble house was just playing house, one couldn\u2019t be more mistaken.A patriarch\u2019s sole responsibility was to develop his house and bulk up its influence. Any patriarch that failed to put the noble house\u2019s interest first would, strictly speaking, be considered a failure.If the Xeclyde House accepted the deal offered by the Mythril Priory, it would mean sacrificing the successor of another noble house for ten years of stability in the Theocracy. Even a fool could tell that this was a beneficial deal to the Xeclydes!Furthermore, the Xeclydes had greater leverage in this deal because what awaited the Mythril Priory if they dared to go against their promise was relentless vengeance.Not even the vilest of evil cults would dare to fool the Holy Eminence. The gains and risks were simply too adversely skewed.The Mythril Priory had shown sufficient sincerity and offered an acceptable reason, but to Caras\u2019 surprise, Holy Eminence John didn\u2019t show much of a reaction. The old man leaned back into his chair and closed his eyes, reminiscent of an ordinary old man napping under the afternoon sun.John Xeclyde was thinking about his earlier meeting with Roel. The boy was a peculiar child. Despite his young age, he had eyes that seemed to have seen much of the world yet still carried innocence. That child\u2019s attitude toward him was neither fawning nor arrogant. He could feel the purity and righteousness in that child\u2019s heart.\u201cCaroline Ascart, Winstor Ascart, and Ro Ascart, those names should be familiar to you, I suppose.\u201dHoly Eminence John spoke all of a sudden.Those were names that once struck fear into the hearts of others, but they had long since disappeared in the annals of history. Caras couldn\u2019t help but frown after hearing those words. This, in turn, brought a faint smile to John\u2019s face.\u201cYou fear them, their bloodline, and their spirit. You\u2019re afraid that they might bring some things out of history that you wish not to see once more. For that, you wouldn\u2019t even let a child who is only showing signs of the prophecy go.\u201d\u201c\u2026 That might be the case, but isn\u2019t keeping the Ascart House under control advantageous to the Xeclydes too? I believe that our interests are aligned here.\u201dCaras\u2019 words made John Xeclyde fall silent for a long while. The old man gazed into the distance, seemingly peering through the river of time, back to the moment when that ancient contract was made a thousand years ago.\u201cThe Xeclydes shall protect the Ascarts; this is a promise that the two noble houses made at the inception of the Third Epoch. Over the past thousand years, the Ascarts have been through several rises and falls, but the Xeclydes never broke that contract. Why should I abandon it now?\u201d\u201cBecause times are changing. Because the world is no longer the same as it was. There\u2019s no such thing as an eternal promise in this world. Someone as wise as you must know that a personal promise means nothing compared to an entire country.\u201d\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re right. From the perspective of a ruler, the interest of an individual should never outweigh the interest of a country.\u201dJohn nodded slightly, which brought a smile to the face of the man on the screen. However, this smile was destined to be short lived.\u201cBut, I reject your offer.\u201dThose words froze the smile on Caras\u2019 face.\u201cMythril Priory, why do you think the Ascarts came to the Theocracy to seek our protection back then?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 do you mean?\u201d\u201cCourage, justice, and fairness. To seek a future for the living, and to redress grievances for the dead. This is the responsibility that those of their bloodline have chosen to take on. The unabated battering of time might have worn down their powers, but they still refuse to yield on their mission. Why do you suppose such a house would seek the help of the Xeclydes?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe old man had been leaning comfortably back into his chair, but now he slowly straightened up as an air of solemnity and majesty drifted from him.\u201cThat\u2019s because they thought that we were alike. They acknowledged the values that we stand for, and they had faith that our clan will be able to stand firm in the face of temptation. They believe that the promises made by those with the Angel\u2019s Bloodline can persevere even before the erosion of time.\u201cThe interest of an individual is indeed minor compared to that of a country, but what do you think the purpose behind the existence of the church is? There are plenty of people who resort to evil as they pursue their greater interests. Unscrupulous men and women in search of immortality and authority tyrannize the masses. In the face of all this, the church is the ray of hope for the weak! From the day of its establishment, it has already been decided that it would never waver from its purpose in the face of greater interests!\u201dJohn Xeclyde\u2019s calm voice slowly grew more and more impassioned. From a benevolent old man, he transformed into a ferocious lion.\u201cAs a ruler, I am compelled to agree to the deal you have proposed. As the patriarch of Xeclyde House, I should have prioritized the interests of the house and put it before all else. However, I am first and foremost the Holy Eminence, the leader of the Genesis Goddess Church! The very value of my existence lies in my compassion and impartiality. Mythril Priory, your actions have insulted the church and the justice I hold dear in my heart!\u201dBefore John Xeclyde could finish his piece, Caras\u2019 face had already turned ghastly pale. He couldn\u2019t comprehend the so-called justice that John stood for, but he could feel an invisible power pulsating across the whole of Loren. In places where he couldn\u2019t see, the high priests, who were in the midst of their prayers, opened their eyes, and the inquisitors, who had devoted their lives to fighting evil cultists, picked up their weapons.\u201cSince you are already here, you might as well stay for good.\u201dJohn Xeclyde declared imposingly before he turned his sights elsewhere. He peered through an entire half of the Holy Capital before his eyes finally fell upon a room within the Labyrinth Villa.\u201cBut thanks to you, I was able to hear what I wanted to hear.\u201dJohn added with a benevolent chuckle.His body began to glow as his bloodline ability traversed across space to fall upon a golden-haired girl within that room.\u201cChild, use your powers to protect your friend\u2026 then bear witness!\u201dHis words echoed in Nora and Roel\u2019s earsFollowing that, a powerful burst of light exploded within the studio, causing the monstrosities lurking all around to scream in horror.\u201cGrandpa, this is\u2026\u201dNora was still perplexed at the start, but she soon realized that the ones embraced by the light weren\u2019t just her but Roel too.Roel\u2019s eyes were wide-open as an intense headache assaulted him once more. Inside the secret chamber of the Labyrinth Villa, a colorful gemstone released a blinding radiance that swept away Peter Kater\u2019s bloodline ability with a powerful explosion.The labyrinth had been activated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Over ten thousand soldiers had fought a bitter battle in this place, using the swords in their hands to shape the future of the country. That was a bloody period of time that revealed both the evil and goodness of humanity, treacherous betrayals and steadfast loyalty, the clash in ideals and wills, and the feud within the royal family over the crown.The splitting headache that Roel experienced when the labyrinth artifact activated was so excruciating that even the accident that brought about his death in his previous life couldn\u2019t compare with it. He felt like his brain was being sizzled on top of a barbecue rack, and his blood and nerves were being stung every single instant. The pain traveled through his veins into his eyes, making him feel as if someone was pumping mercury into his eye sockets.He wanted to scream, but no voice would come out of him. Everything in his line of sight had started to distort. Even when he tried closing his eyes, everything remained blood-red. It felt like something had grabbed hold of his eyes, forcefully keeping them open. Ancient scriptures, stone tablets, broken swords, and all sorts of bizarre items swiftly flashed across his eyes before he finally arrived at the origin of it all.It was a single candle lit amidst the darkness. As the candlelight flickered, he could see indistinguishable silhouettes creeping nearer. However, Roel was too dazed to pay heed to it. Vaguely, he heard the jingling of bells in his ears.\u201cThe kingmaker\u2026\u201d sounded a hoarse voice.Roel couldn\u2019t tell where the voice had come from, but in the next moment, everything dissipated into emptiness. Darkness descended upon him once more as he lost consciousness.\u2014The pulsation of bloodline\u2014this was currently what Nora was feeling. Her last memory before she was knocked out was a massive burst of light as the Labyrinth Villa broke through the studio. It was only when the searing pain in her bloodline jolted her awake that she finally opened her eyes once more. She found herself lying in a foreign environment, and lying next to her was a black-haired boy.\u201cRoel, what wrong? Roel! Roel!!!\u201d\u201cArgh, my head\u2026 It hurts\u2026 Nora?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s me. Are you fine?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Can\u2019t say so.\u201dRoel forced himself to answer Nora\u2019s question. His head was still aching terribly, and the pain only further intensified for his eyes. It was so unbearable that Roel\u2019s body curled up as he gritted his teeth and clenched his fists tightly.However, his response seemed to have put Nora in a spot.\u201cRoel, I know you aren\u2019t in good shape right now, but there\u2019s something really wrong here\u2026\u201dNora\u2019s voice sounded a little flustered. Roel, who was in such great pain that he wanted to start rolling around, forced himself to open his searing eyes and focus his attention on his surroundings. An incomprehensible sight awaited him.How could this be? Why would there be sunlight here?He was so shocked that he even forgot about his pain for a moment.It had been less than half an hour between Peter Kater\u2019s sudden arrival and the activation of the labyrinth. Even if he had fainted along the way, surely it shouldn\u2019t have already been daylight by the time he woke once more?The confusion made Roel\u2019s senses grow dull. He tried his best to assess his surroundings, and he soon realized that the sunlight was actually the least of his worries\u2026Half-collapsed buildings, bloodstains everywhere, corpses lying all along the street, shattered fragments of bricks strewn about, flipped carriages\u2026Everything Roel saw was so incredulous that he suspected he was hallucinating, but the vividness of the scene didn\u2019t just apply to his sense of sight. He could smell the choking stench of rotting corpses and the shouts sounding from afar, which only further drove home the fact that everything was real.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? T-this is\u2026\u201d\u201cRoel\u2026 Is this a scene created by the Ascart House\u2019s labyrinth?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 think so\u2026\u201d\u201cCould it be grandpa\u2019s doing then? But\u2026\u201dRoel forced himself up as he scanned his surroundings once more in bewilderment beside Nora. They were both dumbfounded by the unexpected scene change.\u201cThat Peter fellow doesn\u2019t seem to be nearby. I saw him getting hit squarely by the light earlier.\u201cPeter?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m referring to that evil cultist.\u201d\u201cHow do you know his name?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a spell. No, that\u2019s not important now. We should quickly get a grasp of what\u2019s going on first.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Alright.\u201dRoel and Nora climbed to their feet under each other\u2019s support, and they began wandering around the area in search of clues to determine the situation. It was also around then that a familiar tone sounded in Roel\u2019s head.\u3010Ding!\u3011\u3010System is activating\u2026\u3011\u3010System activated.\u3011\u3010Acquiring new information\u2026\u3011\u3010User Interface refreshed.\u3011\u3010Name: Roel AscartGender: MaleAge: 10Bloodline: IronEpithet: Fist King of the Royal Garden, Protector of the LadyTier: E+Fundamental Spells: Minor Heatwave, Phantom Hands, Focused Burst, Controlled Breathing, Spell Gloves\u3011Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u3010Warning!\u3011\u3010Warning!\u3011\u3010Warning!\u3011\u3010System detected symptoms of \u2018Restoration of Primordial Bloodline\u2019.\u3011\u3010Evaluation of Risk Level: Extremely Dangerous\u3011\u3010The interweaving of history and present; the amalgamation of light and shadow.

Why did so many notifications suddenly pop up at once?The sudden emergence of the System notices shocked Roel. Bearing with the pain, he took a careful look at this User Interface and noticed that his tier had unknowingly risen to E+. Putting it in the standards of this world, he should be one of the stronger Origin Level 6s now. Surprisingly, he had also received an epithet, though it was a rather strange one.Fist King of the Royal Garden\u2026 He probably got it from punching those young nobles back at the birthday banquet, while Protector of the Lady should be referring to how he protected Alicia back then. However, that wasn\u2019t the biggest problem here.What really drenched Roel in cold sweat were the additional notifications regarding his bloodline, especially the two striking crimson words, \u2018Extremely Dangerous\u2019. He couldn\u2019t help but grimace.The System was a queer existence, preaching about freedom and giving all sorts of terribly vague descriptions. However, it had been very responsible in listing down the side effects of items and keeping him away from danger. If it deemed something to be \u2018Extremely Dangerous\u2019, it would be wise for him to pay heed to the warning.But, why would all of these notifications suddenly pop up right now? Could it have something to do with the current situation he was in? Furthermore, what did the words mean that Holy Eminence John said before he passed out?Roel was extremely confused at the moment. He felt there was a need for him to straighten things out first.First and foremost, the System mentioned \u2018Restoration of Primordial Bloodline\u2019. Did this mean that the Ascart House had some sort of unique bloodline that was passed down through the generations too? But why hadn\u2019t he heard anything about it from Carter before? In any case, it seemed to be something rather powerful.Roel pondered it a little longer, and he soon shook his head.Who really knew whether it was a good thing or not? If the bloodline was restored too far, he might just end up turning into an orangutan. Besides, the price to pay for it appeared to be far too great\u2014just the pain in his eyes was already hard enough to bear! And once again, the description the System provided\u2026Son of a banshee, can\u2019t the System say something that makes sense for once? What the hell am I supposed to make out of this?He felt like he was going bald just by reading the vague description. History and present, light and dark; what the hell did all of this mean?Damn it all. My physical condition is faring very badly right now, there\u2019s something funny with the surroundings, and a crazy painter is out for my life!All of these factors made Roel feel like he was facing unprecedentedly great danger.Give up? I\u2019ll be losing a chance to obtain a powerful trump card if I give up now! If it was any other circumstances, I might have still chosen to give up, but a crazed dog is thinking of mashing me down into meat paste to paint his portraits!But speaking of which, if I were to give up on the Restoration of Primordial Bloodline, will I receive any compensation?\u3010This System obeys the law of equal exchange. The greatest reward for giving up the Restoration of Primordial Bloodline is safety. The user should know that safety always ranks first!\u3011\u2026 Here comes the preach again.Roel felt that he had already tried his best to remain on the safe side ever since he came to this world. He got close to his adopted sister, avoided the princess, and spent his days eating and sleeping without stirring trouble. From time to time, he would even do some good deeds to help the people of the Ascart Fiefdom.He didn\u2019t believe that there was anyone in this world who had lived safer than he had! Yet, he still ended up falling into such a damned situation in the end.Just thinking about it made rage rush to Roel\u2019s head, leaving him furious and indignant.What if I insist on awakening my bloodline?\u3010Calculating\u2026\u3011\u3010With the assistance of the System, the chances of success will be 60%\u3011\u3010Aid of a possessor of the Angel\u2019s Bloodline confirmed.

However, if the user fails to repay the debt in full within 5 years, System will automatically go into shutdown.\u3011\u201cEarning 500,000 gold coins within 5 years\u2026\u201d muttered Roel under his breath with a tight frown.He looked at the collapsed walls and corpses all around him. He could hear a loud commotion echoing from a place where his eyes couldn\u2019t see. It was clear to him that many people had been rallied together here for a purpose. As for what that purpose was, Roel could roughly fathom a guess.War.Just by looking at his surroundings, it was obvious that they were navigating a street ravaged by war. The weapons and corpses lying all over the place couldn\u2019t possibly make that any more obvious. Had Roel not been \u2018trained\u2019 for this through the gruesome gore movies he had seen in his previous life, he would have vomited right away.Knowing they were in the middle of a war, though, did nothing to enlighten them to the plight they were in. Roel had a ludicrous deduction in his mind, but he didn\u2019t voice it aloud because he was hoping for it not to be the case.He shot a look at Nora to check on her current condition. She was currently squatting behind a ruin to observe the surroundings, looking for a safe location where they could rest for the time being.Even though she was trying her best to conceal it, through her slight gestures and expressions, Roel was still able to tell that she was suffering from some sort of abnormal physical condition too. Ever since they were transported here, her movements felt a little delayed.It must be an effect from the burst of light Holy Eminence John caused\u2026 But, shouldn\u2019t that be a buff rather than a debuff? It can\u2019t be that her bloodline is awakening right now, can it?Roel wondered as he tightened his fists.All transcendental powers in this world came at a price, and this included bloodlines too. The Angel\u2019s Bloodline was much safer in the sense that the cost of using its abilities was much lower, but nevertheless, the awakening from Bronze-tier to Silver-tier still carried significant dangers.Recalling how Nora bravely stood forth to protect him from Peter earlier, Roel felt something stirring within him. He felt that it was time to repay the debt.It was one thing if he was truly completely helpless, but someone had already pointed a road out for him. Given that Nora was in bad shape now, it was his turn to step up and shoulder the burden.70% probability of success, I shall bet on it!\u201cYes, I choose to awaken my bloodline!\u201d\u3010Bloodline Awakening Support System activating\u2026\u3011\u3010Pain Suppression System activated.\u3011\u3010Adaptation System activated.\u3011\u3010Progress of Bloodline Awakening: 17%\u3011A series of notifications popped up from the System. As if many steroids were injected into Roel\u2019s body all at once, he felt his headache swiftly receding as the mana in his body grew explosively. A light cracking sound echoed within his body as his bones and muscles automatically adjusted into the most suitable constitution to match his abilities.Several seconds later, Roel leaped to his feet. His golden eyes regained their previous spirit, and his movements were sharp and nimble. This abrupt change surprised Nora, who was still busy scanning the area.\u201cRoel, are you fine now?\u201d\u201cPretty much so. Did you manage to find anything?\u201d\u201cNot yet. It seems like an intense battle has just occurred in the vicinity; there are barely any buildings that are still intact. There aren\u2019t any good hiding places at the moment. Furthermore, I think that our current position isn\u2019t too good.\u201dNora looked around at the corpses surrounding them with a tight frown on her face.Having been trained in a Knight Order from a young age, she knew of the military conventions during wartime. For one, every army would make sure to sweep the battlefield to clear off or capture any remaining enemies and acquire any useful supplies from the deceased. For fights in cities, it was of paramount importance that they quickly cleared away the corpses. Otherwise, if the rotting corpses were to contaminate the sewage waters, it could very well lead to a plague.There had been cases in history where the entire populace of a city had died out due to that.Given that this was a standard protocol that any army that had been through formal training would know, it was bizarre why these corpses were left here rotting.Nora could think of three possibilities to explain it.\u201cFirst, both armies have suffered severe losses; they don\u2019t have enough manpower to clean up the battlefield. Second, there is special personnel like those from the Skeleton Cult casting barriers around the area to prevent a plague from occurring. And, as for the last possibility\u2026\u201dNora gulped down a mouthful of saliva before she spoke with a slightly nervous voice.\u201c\u2026 the battle is still ongoing, and we\u2019re standing right in the middle of it.\u201dRoel looked at Nora as his eyes twitched a little. Silence lingered between them for a while before Roel finally composed himself.\u201cWhat we have to do now is to collect intelligence. We need to find out the current time, our location, and the identities of those fighting against one another. The more information we have, the greater our chances of getting through this.\u201cPutting aside my Ascart House, there aren\u2019t many organizations in the world who would dare to challenge the Xeclydes. If we follow the adage of \u2018an enemy\u2019s enemy is a friend\u2019, we can assume that at least one of the factions fighting here would be willing to take us in.\u201d\u201cYes, I agree with you on that, but how should we go about it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too risky for us to attempt to capture a living person when we haven\u2019t made sense of anything at all, so let\u2019s go for a dead one instead.\u201dAs Roel spoke, his eyes drifted over to a body lying on the ground that had multiple arrows stuck in his back like a porcupine. Just by looking at the appearance, that person was definitely dead. However, if one knew what to look out for, there was still plenty of critical information that one could acquire from him.Roel first picked up a rake broom that was conveniently lying close to him before scanning the vantage points he could possibly be sniped from.Oh right, there aren\u2019t any 98k or that sort of firearms in this world.After ensuring that the coast was clear, he stretched the rake broom outward to hook the corpse before carefully pulling him in. The rake broom appeared to have come from one of the nearby well-to-do houses to sweep their gardens. Roel had seen the servants in the Ascart Manor using the same type of broom, just that it was longer and stiffer than the one he was currently holding.The manor of a marquess house is much larger, after all. It makes sense that our servants would need better tools,Roel entertained himself with such thoughts while reeling the corpse in.It took several minutes, but he finally managed to pull the corpse over to his side. Once the job was done, Roel tossed aside the rake broom before flipping the corpse frontward to search his body.\u201cHow is it? Did you find anything?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a blonde-haired young man. Well-built, quite young, possibly in his thirties. I can\u2019t identify the origin of his armor and weapon, but their quality appears to be so-so. Oh, wait a moment. This is\u2026\u201dRoel had begun patting the corpse from the head down, and his attention was soon captured by an insignia carved on the corner of the man\u2019s breastplate. It was an insignia depicting a red beast standing on its back feet, baring its fangs ferociously.\u201cIsn\u2019t this the insignia of the Elric House?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dNora, who was still keeping a lookout for enemies, exclaimed in astonishment. She quickly squatted beside the corpse to examine the insignia too.\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026 No, there\u2019s something odd. This armor\u2026\u201dNora\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What did you notice?\u201dRoel, who immediately took over Nora\u2019s sentry job, asked anxiously, but he didn\u2019t receive a response. He waited for another two more minutes before he finally glanced backward to take a look, only to see the golden-haired girl stripping off the soldier\u2019s armor.What\u2019s going on? What is she trying to do over there?Does this world not have a culture of respecting the deceased? Do we really have to strip him bare?\u201cNora, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cNo, this is impossible. But\u2026\u201dNoticing that Roel was looking at her, Nora quickly tried to compose herself. Despite this, Roel could still see a mixture of confusion and fluster on her face, an expression that hardly anyone had seen on her before.Roel quickly squatted down to meet her face-to-face, hoping to calm her down. Nora stared into Roel\u2019s golden eyes for a long while before she finally began speaking.\u201cThere\u2019s something weird about this soldier. All of the items that he\u2019s wearing come from Empress Victoria\u2019s era!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was not because of an enemy attack or a problem with his body, but a natural response to the sheer shock he felt.The clues littered everywhere had given him a rough idea as to the situation he was in, but he still found the current situation hard to believe. Traversing through time and returning into history, is this really something transcendents can accomplish with their strength?At the very least, Roel knew for sure that neither Nora nor himself was capable of this. At Origin Levels 5 and 6, the two of them were much too weak! Even Origin Level 4 Peter Kater was able to easily triumph over them.It was impossible for them to deal with anything related to space-time, given the limitations of their strength. This world that they lived in was one that didn\u2019t have convenient teleportation doors like those commonly seen in fantasy works, or else traveling wouldn\u2019t have been such a massive hassle!There were indeed transcendents with space-related abilities, but most of them were limited to short-distance teleportation, and they would have to pay a frighteningly hefty price to use it. And this was still for the easier-to-grasp spatial abilities!Roel had never even heard of anyone wielding a time-related ability before, and clearly, it was the same for Nora too.\u201cCould it be my grandfather who sent us here? But, I don\u2019t think anyone in our house has that sort of ability\u2026\u201d muttered Nora in confusion.All of a sudden, she set her eyes on Roel, assessing him from head to toe. By the process of elimination, if it wasn\u2019t herself, it could only be him. However, her companion was just as baffled as she was.Time ticked by in silence. Fear of the unknown was gradually creeping into their hearts, leaving them feeling like rudderless ships heading into turbulent waters. It took quite a while before they were finally able to calm themselves down.\u201cIt could be the labyrinth artifact, or that I might have some mysterious ability that I don\u2019t know of, but in any case\u2026 it seems like we really have returned back to Empress Victoria\u2019s era.\u201d\u201cSuch a thing\u2026\u201d murmured Nora.\u201cOtherwise, we can\u2019t explain this corpse either. Is there any soldier in the world who would wear a set of antiques from a hundred years ago and march off to war? Besides, it\u2019s obvious that this armor is still new, not some sort of old artifact.\u201dRoel picked up the breastplate to emphasize its lustrous metallic surface that clearly hadn\u2019t been through the test of time yet. Toward this, Nora was unable to come up with any counterargument.\u201cSpeaking of which, how can you tell that it is from Empress Victoria\u2019s era?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been training in the Knight Order since I was young. My historical knowledge of military equipment is still quite reliable.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euPrompted by Roel\u2019s question, Nora pointed to the shoulder intersection of the breastplate.\u201cIn more recent breastplate designs of the Theocracy, this portion is usually linked using chainmail. However, during Empress Victoria\u2019s era, the mainstream way is to use multiple layers of this silk-like material to link up this intersection.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dRoel tried to prod the white silk used for the shoulder intersection of the breastplate, and it was surprisingly hard to the touch. He could tell that this material was newly woven, causing it to still be rather stiff.\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s find some other clues. We need to first figure out of where we are,\u201d said Roel.He lifted the breastplate and tried checking the fit, but in the end, he could only toss it away with a deep sigh after confirming that it was too big for him. It would be great if he could wear it. For one, it would have raised his defensive ability, and for the other\u2026Well, he and Nora were simply dressed toofinely, wearing a suit and a dress respectively. No matter how one looked at it, they were awfully out of place with the surroundings.Furthermore, the two of them were blessed with good-looking appearances, making them look like child models standing in the midst of a battlefield. It was both overly conspicuous and incongruous, making them likely to attract unwanted attention all around.One must know that noble children were free money during times of tumult! It was commonplace for revolutionary armies to kidnap noble children and demand ransom money from their houses. If their houses refused to pay up, they could then sell the noble children elsewhere to serve as slaves.\u201cThe armor is too big for us to wear. Let\u2019s find some plain clothes from the residences nearby.\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s already turning dark. We need to move quickly.\u201dThe two of them quickly discussed their plan under the final embers of the evening sun, before determining their destination to be the three relatively intact residences right ahead of them. The stronger Nora led the group, and weaker Roel backed her up with his short sword.Their journey was still relatively smooth as vision under the setting sun was rather poor, and the physiques of those two children were much smaller than the bulky armored soldiers. It was hard for anyone to notice them from afar.The first thing that the two of them saw upon sneaking into the courtyard of one of the three residences was the usual bloodstains and corpses. Nora quickly searched for a safe pathway into the residence whereas Roel shot glances at the breastplates worn by the corpses, paying close heed to their insignias.Tiger, tiger, and tiger again. Looks like the Elric House has suffered great casualties. Good!Having a clear distinction between ally and enemy allowed Roel to put aside his empathy for the deceased soldiers. After scanning the area and finding nothing dangerous, he proceeded to enter the residence through the open windows. It was safer this way, since they would be able to avoid the creaking noise produced by opening doors.The two of them remained next to the window a while to control their breathing before advancing ahead once more.There were too many dead corners inside the residence, and they weren\u2019t sure if anyone else was here or not. So, they were forced to proceed more carefully than ever. It took them ten minutes to sweep this two-storeyed residence.All in all, there were two casualties inside. One of them was a soldier stationed by the windows on the second floor\u2014it looked like his face got mosaiced out by some sort of powerful spell\u2014and the other one was an old man killed in the living room. Roel deduced that the old man was the owner of this residence, judging from his fine garments, the silver pocket watch that hadn\u2019t been picked, and an envelope on his chest.\u300cEsteemed Sire Rhodes,I have followed your request, securing my possessions and sending my family members away in advance. However, the fighting in the city has been worsening with each passing day. I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019ll eventually reach here as well.I hope that you can find a way to help me so that I can tide through this crisis safely.Edward PottYear 828, 13 March\u300dNora fell silent after reading the letter. Roel also sighed deeply as well.March of Year 828, this was a date that left a deep imprint in history. The battle of the royal twins, March Turmoil. It was said to be the biggest event in recent history for the Theocracy, a battle that marked a turning point for the country. It was an event that had been studied time and time again by historians.Who could have thought that a day would come where they would become witnesses for this major event?\u201cAlright, let\u2019s stop thinking too much into it. The most important thing we have to do now is to ensure our survival. We need to secure water and food. Let\u2019s search the area,\u201d said Roel as he pulled himself together.Nora, now reminded of their purpose here, also quickly nodded in agreement. The two of them began ransacking the residence, searching the kitchen, the dining room, the washrooms, and even the bedrooms on the second floor. However, there wasn\u2019t a morsel of food nor a drop of potable water to be found.Most likely, the soldiers already ransacked the place.\u201cTsk, aren\u2019t they way too thorough with their ransacking? We need to do our searching at night, or else it\u2019ll be hard for us to get supplies once dawn arrives. There aren\u2019t any proper clothes here either; all of them have been ripped to shreds,\u201d grumbled Roel.\u201cSame formation. Let\u2019s go.\u201dThe two children, whose teamwork was gradually improving, quickly left the first residence and headed off to the second one. But this time around, they encountered an unexpected situation.\u201cWait a moment, where did this mist come from?\u201d\u201cThis is weird. There wasn\u2019t any mist when we came here earlier!\u201d\u201cThis is bad. It must be the effect of the labyrinth!\u201dThe sudden shrouding of the mist left them in a fluster. It arrived so quickly that it only took dozens of seconds for their distant destination to become completely blurred.That wasn\u2019t the end of their bad luck. Just as they were about to make haste toward the second residence, they suddenly heard many footsteps coming from their front left. What was abnormal about this situation was that the sound of the footsteps didn\u2019t crescendo gradually; it was quiet one moment and loud the next, as if they had appeared out of nowhere!Completely caught off guard, Roel and Nora ended up bumping right into this group of soldiers. At the same time, a voice sounded from their front right, and a blurred figure gradually approached amidst the mist.Just like how Roel and Nora were astonished by this ridiculous encounter, the armored soldiers were equally taken aback. The commander of the soldiers took quick note of the fine clothes Roel and Nora were wearing, and his eyes lit up. He immediately issued an order for the soldiers to capture them.\u201cSuspicious figures! Capture them!\u201d\u201cRoel, we\u2019re going to run. Hold my hand!\u201dFollowing the commander\u2019s order, the soldiers drew their weapons and approached Roel and Nora. Seeing that the situation was very disadvantageous to them, Nora reached out to grab Roel\u2019s hand as she prepared to flee into the depths of the mist.To her surprise, Roel grabbed her wrist instead and stopped her.\u201cRoel?\u201dNora looked at Roel in surprise, then she noticed that his eyes were not on the approaching soldiers but the other figure approaching from their front right. The figure had already come into their line of sight while no one was paying heed to him.It was a pale-faced, black-haired man covered with blood. There was a fresh stream of blood that was flowing down from his left shoulder, which he was clasping with his right hand. He appeared to be in a bad state.Yes, it was none other than Peter Kater.His sudden appearance swiftly caught the attention of the soldiers. Before they could demand that he identify himself, Roel had already delivered the answer that they were looking for.It was a marvelous performance that transcended the boundaries of reality and fiction, expressing such vivid details that it drew the audience into the scenario he crafted. With eyes glistening with tears of agitation, Roel looked at the stunned Peter as if the man was some long lost kin that he had just reunited with.\u201cNow! They have fallen for our trap, Uncle Peter!\u201d shouted Roel.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 - \u2018Traitor\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 71: \u2018Traitor\u2019Peter Kater couldn\u2019t remember how long it had been since anyone called him in such an intimate manner, especially not from a child.He hated children. Those darned rascals often mocked his art just because their lack of experience prohibited them from comprehending the profound intricacies behind his masterpieces\u2026 though the same could be said about adults too.But, on this very day, his popularity amongst children suddenly soared to a new high. He was even intimately addressed as \u2018Uncle Peter\u2019! Of course, this came at a very heavy price.The words \u2018fallen for our trap\u2019 made the soldiers, who were planning to surround Roel and Nora, freeze on the spot. The commander shot a look at Peter and immediately realized that there was something strange going on.This \u2018Uncle Peter\u2019 person had a pale face and was drenched in blood too, but the only injury he had was a wound on his shoulder. In other words, the bloodstains on his body were not his! Furthermore, to dare wander in this area without wearing any armor, it could only mean that he was a transcendent, a high-level one at that!\u201cEnemy attack!!!\u201dThe wary commander immediately shouted out loud. Peter Kater looked at the alarmed soldiers, and it finally dawned on him that Roel had pulled one over him.\u201cYou stupid brat, what nonsense are you\u2026\u201d\u201cOpen up the formation! Cover the frontlines!\u201dRealizing that Peter could be a magician, the commander immediately raised his sword and charged at him. There were ten other soldiers who quickly followed him, prepared to cover him if anything were to happen.Having fought on the battlefield for a long time, their instinctive reaction upon encountering a possibly hostile magician was to immediately turn against him. Their furious howls drowned out Peter\u2019s explanations.\u201cWait a moment, I\u2026 No, I am not\u2026 Shit!\u201dThe arrows that whizzed across the sky was the last straw. Just tens of meters away from Roel and Nora, a huge battle suddenly broke out. Dozens of soldiers began clashing with Peter Kater.Soldiers that had been through life-and-death situations were indeed different. In terms of absolute strength, this platoon of soldiers couldn\u2019t be said to be strong. Even the three commanders leading the group were only at Origin Level 5 themselves, and the others were Origin Level 6, which Roel could deal with individually.However, the fighting prowess they displayed far exceeded that of Roel and Nora combined. The frontliners stood forth to encircle Peter whereas the archers were constantly releasing arrows to curb Peter\u2019s movements. The 3 Origin Level 5s wisely chose to skirt around the battlefield, dealing out sharp attacks whenever Peter\u2019s guard was down before slipping away.Their organized coordination allowed them to fight on par with the powerful Peter despite their weakness. In just a few moments, both sides had already seen blood. Peter\u2019s prided \u2018Smiling Mother\u2019 howled furiously as it clawed the throats of anyone in range. However, the presence of casualties didn\u2019t deter the soldiers; if anything, it triggered their bloodthirst and rage.In a moment of carelessness, Peter was stabbed in his thigh by one of the commanders.\u201cArgh!!! You bunch of imbeciles are asking for it!\u201d howled Peter in fury.Roel and Nora decided it was time to make their escape. They knew they couldn\u2019t afford to get caught up in this fight, and they would only expose themselves to danger by sticking around.The two children held each other\u2019s hands tightly as they fled the area while gasping for air. They ran toward the direction of the second residence, but after traveling for a while, they encountered a new problem.\u201cThis isn\u2019t right. Judging from the distance, we should have already arrived by now.\u201d\u201cThe legendary mist labyrinth in the March Turmoil\u2026 Granted that we\u2019re within the labyrinth now, it would be a wonder if we can reach our destination.\u201d\u201cWhat should we do? Does your Ascart House have any records regarding the labyrinth?\u201d\u201cRecords? You mean the list of missing people?\u201d retorted Roel in exasperation.He pondered for a while longer before finally replying.\u201cThere\u2019s no way to decipher the labyrinth. This is its greatest strength, as well as the reason why it eventually became a legend. According to the records, Prince Wade led his personal guards into the labyrinth, but he was still unable to get to the Labyrinth Villa. The only ones who are able to truly navigate within this labyrinth are the people who have our family heirloom.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re referring to the labyrinth artifact? Is it with you?\u201d\u201cOf course not. Given the current timeline we\u2019re in, the artifact is definitely intheirhands,\u201d replied Roel as he looked into the depths of the billowing mist.It was almost as if he was peering through the mist to look at the duo who had become close companions with one another due to this battle and opened up a new era of friendship between the Ascarts and the Xeclydes.\u201c\u2026 Mister Ponte and Empress Victoria,\u201d mumbled Nora as she revealed the answer.She looked a little dazed after hearing those words. As Empress Victoria was her ancestor and one of the few female leaders of the Theocracy, she had always carried great admiration for Empress Victoria. Just thinking of the possibility that she would be able to meet Empress Victoria in person made her a little agitated.Roel, on the other hand, looked a little conflicted about this current situation.Am I going to meet that old pervert?Had Roel not read the diary, he might have felt a little moved about meeting Ponte Ascart. But right now, he was only praying hard that his predecessor at least looked decent on the surface\u2026Eyy, it\u2019s no wonder they say that it\u2019s the victors that make history. Just how much did Ponte have to be beautified for people to actually view him as a hero?But as Roel thought more about it, he wondered if he was only feeling so disappointed because his expectations of Ponte had been too high. After all, there was no perfect human being in the world, including heroes. Everyone had their own desires and \u2018dark side\u2019, but at least Ponte\u2019s dark side appeared to have been kept in check.Roel didn\u2019t think any deeper into it since it wasn\u2019t the right time to do so, especially after he had noticed that there was something abnormal about Nora\u2019s condition\u2014her hands were burning!Ordinary humans, even when afflicted with a high fever, couldn\u2019t possibly have their body temperature shoot up so high. Even transcendents whose bodies had been enhanced couldn\u2019t possibly have felt so scalding to the touch.Is she facing some problems with her bloodline? Her physical condition\u2026\u201cIt won\u2019t do for us to remain in this mist. The labyrinth might be formidable, but at the very least, it doesn\u2019t have any offensive power. For the time being, let\u2019s find a place to hide first, or else it\u2019s only a matter of time before we bump into others. This time, I\u2019ll lead the way.\u201dAs Roel spoke, he stepped in front of the clearly weakened Nora and began scouting the way forward with his short sword in hand. Nora was stunned for a while, staring at the boy who was suddenly showing such proactiveness. A moment later, a helpless smile curled on her lips.Looks like I\u2019m unable to hide it after all, she thought.With a deep sigh, she allowed Roel to drag her around.Typically speaking, the proud Nora would have never given up the initiative in such a dangerous situation and entrust her life to another person. She was born a leader, and her very will was the edict of the gods. No one could lead her, and no one would dare to either. That would be an act of insubordination, a show of disrespect toward her.Her strategy teacher had warned her to guard herself against anyone who tried to influence her will\u2014it was likely that the person had traitorous thoughts in mind. Nora had taken his words to heart.But today, when this boy with \u2018traitorous thoughts\u2019 grabbed her hands and pulled her around, Nora suddenly felt that her teacher wasn\u2019t entirely right either. Despite the searing sensation engulfing her body, a smile still formed on her lips.What a fool. He\u2019s so weak, but he still wants to play the hero.This night of horrors hadn\u2019t come to an end yet, but her perception of Roel had changed after seeing all of the little actions he made.In the past, it was out of interest and the shared knowledge of her secret that kept her eyeing him so fervently. She derived joy from secretly observing his troubled expressions. But now, her intentions had changed.She wanted to keep him by her side. For a long, long time to come, that was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 - Holy SonsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 72: Holy SonsRoel had never bothered intentionally putting on a good face before Nora. In fact, he was more than eager to avoid her whenever possible. In the past, Nora had attributed this to her lacking charisma, but now that she was being protected by him in this labyrinth of despair, it dawned on her that something else could be at play.She could sense that Roel didn\u2019t dislike her. What he disliked was fawning on her. In a sense, he was quite an obstinate person, or perhaps, it might be more accurate to say that he was a prideful person. Even as the exalted princess of the Theocracy, she couldn\u2019t hope to command subservience from him.Yet, in times of danger, he was someone who was worth entrusting her back to.Nora felt that she and Roel, at their core, were very similar.Righteous, kind, and prideful, they wouldn\u2019t allow themselves to yield in any circumstances. In fact, Roel could have made very different choices tonight, especially back at Peter Kater\u2019s art studio. It wasn\u2019t just Nora\u2019s character being put to the test back then.Faced with a deadly assassin who possessed terrifying strength far beyond either of them, even the powerful Nora could hardly keep her fear in check, let alone the weaker Roel. Yet, he stubbornly chose to hold onto his true nature, which made Nora delighted to know that she hadn\u2019t chosen the wrong man.It was no longer just about her desire to step on him and fulfill her sadistic tendencies anymore. Her feelings for Roel were already advancing in a direction which even she couldn\u2019t make sense of.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 34 minutes agoIt was a warm feeling, sometimes a little itchy even. Her mind would suddenly heat up from time to time, but it wasn\u2019t an illness. She realized that she was gradually losing control of her desire to dominate him, but despite all her intelligence, she found herself unable to do a thing about it.Somehow, there was a mysterious feeling inside telling her that as long as the two of them remained with one another, they might just be able to overcome the current crisis they were in. Having always been a logical person, she was a little baffled by how this inexplicable notion was able to easily overtake her thoughts.Roel\u2019s footsteps halted suddenly. Pulled back from her thoughts, Nora raised her head and noticed the blurred outlines of buildings appearing ahead of them.It was a monastery.It was rather humble-looking, being small in size and having an old architectural design. It was mainly built from stone, though most of its renovations consisted of wood that was of unknown origin but obviously didn\u2019t look terribly expensive. Hanging at the main door was a wooden panel bearing the insignia of the Genesis Goddess Church. The oil lamp at the entrance was unlit, and the entire building seemed to creak at the slightest breeze.Nora began scanning the building carefully, whereas a frown swiftly formed on Roel\u2019s face.\u201cWhat\u2019s with this building?\u201dAmidst dark shadows and the veiling mist, this sinister building looked as if it could have come right out of hell. The atmosphere around it was so chilling that it would have halted the footsteps of any human approaching it.Roel shot a look at the surroundings and noticed a signpost demarcating their current location: Locke Street 42.\u201cThis appears to be a minor monastery,\u201d said Nora as she took a step forward to stand side-by-side with Roel.In contrast to Roel\u2019s frown, there was a pleased smile on her lips. She seemed to think that this monastery was not too bad.The Genesis Goddess Church was incredibly massive, spanning the whole of humankind, with customs that varied greatly from country to country. Due to that, there were many different interpretations of the church doctrines too. Other than the founding principles of the religion, the church was still relatively lax on other issues.All in all, one could segment the clergy of the Genesis Goddess Church into two types.One was the devout ascetics who stayed in monasteries. They lived a life of abstinence, devoting all of their efforts into deciphering the teachings of the church and enlightening the masses.The other was the priests. They were allowed to marry, and there were hardly any restraints on their actions. However, if an emergency situation occurred, they were expected to answer the church\u2019s call and obey their dispatch.Essentially, the clergy of the Genesis Goddess Church could choose to either live independently by themselves or become paid subordinates. The building before them was a monastery for the ascetics\u2026 and to put it bluntly, it was basically an elementary school.It was small in size, and the knowledge they imparted would be relatively shallow. The monks and nuns that lived in such places made a living by teaching those who lived in the neighborhood. The school fees were cheap though, making it very friendly to the masses. It was a good education option for those in the lower stratum of society.\u201cThis architectural design seems to be from Paul III\u2019s era. It should be at least 300 years old judging from the current time we are in. It\u2019s rare for a small monastery like this to be able to survive so long.\u201dRoel\u2019s cheeks twitched a little after hearing Nora\u2019s words of approval. It went without saying that the Little Miss Angel, who was a higher-up of the church, would have an inherently positive impression of the churches and monasteries of the same affiliation, but the same didn\u2019t apply to him.He only felt cold shudders running down his spine looking at this old, rundown building.\u201cDo you suggest we enter this monastery?\u201d\u201cMm, I think that it\u2019s a good idea to take cover here. The building might be old, but it\u2019s steady. There don\u2019t seem to be marks of battles around, so there shouldn\u2019t have been any major skirmishes in the area. I think it\u2019ll be safer here. Besides, an old monastery like this one tends to have no lack of rations. We should be able to acquire what we\u2019re looking for here.\u201dNora\u2019s detailed analysis of why they should enter the monastery left Roel at a loss of words to refute her. He took in a deep breath before finally bucking up his courage to step forward.\u201cFollow me.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dRoel cautiously approached the monastery. He walked past the oil lamps, which were swaying ominously in the wind, and scanned the surroundings warily. Then, he raised his hand and attempted to push open the doors of the monastery.\u201cIt\u2019s locked. Seems like there are people inside.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that they\u2019re likely to be soldiers, or else there would have been someone on sentry duty outside.\u201dAfter a quick discussion, Roel and Nora deduced that the people inside could be the monks and nuns that were originally residing in the monastery, and that the risk wasn\u2019t too high. Nora stepped forward and placed her hand on the crack between the doors. Light poured forth from her hands to form an incredibly slim blade, and she used it to sever the wooden latch locking the doors.Bam!The doors opened inward.\u201cAh! Y-you\u2026\u201dBefore the two of them could enter the monastery, a shrill shriek sounded from behind the door. Roel turned to look at the origin of the sound, and he saw an orange-haired middle-aged man dressed in the robes of a monk. He looked a little thin.\u201cD-don\u2019t kill me\u2026 Ah? The two of you\u2026 aren\u2019t soldiers?\u201dThe monk, Klaude, kneeled on the floor as he pleaded for mercy, but halfway through his words, he noticed that the two figures walking through the doorway were shorter and thinner than he had expected. They weren\u2019t soldiers but children!The gentle light within the room brought focus to the elegant clothes that the two children were wearing. The black-haired, golden-eyed boy looked suave with the silver sword he had in hand, and the golden-haired, sapphire-eyed girl carried an air of grace as faint light shimmered around her.Their appearances left Klaude dumbfounded for a moment. His body shuddered as a thought suddenly surfaced in his mind.Wait a moment. This scene looks oddly familiar\u2026 Isn\u2019t this the same as the Holy Sons myth?!Klaude couldn\u2019t help but recall a certain mural depicting the Holy Sons in the church.The mural spoke of a legend where, during an era when the world was filled with war and suffering, Sia dispatched two envoys down to the mortal world to listen to the hardships of humankind. The envoys were known to be a boy and a girl, and they were beautiful, wise, and kind. They set out on a journey to hear the woes of mortals and offer them salvation.Klaude stared at the pair of bizarre children standing before him. All of a sudden, an excited look appeared on his face, and his head began glowing green\u2026 or at least that was what Roel saw.(Affection Points +100!)(Affection Points +100!)\u2026To make it even more terrifying, Klaude even began to praise Sia, speaking of how benevolent the great Sia was to send the Holy Sons down to the world and all sorts of incomprehensible nonsense.His hysterical actions left Roel and Nora utterly dumbstruck.\u201cNo, please hold on for a second\u2026\u201dIt took a great deal of effort before the two children finally managed to explain their plight and put a stop to Klaude\u2019s hysteria. Klaude nodded after hearing their explanation, seemingly accepting their story, but in truth, the reverence he carried for the two of them still remained unabatedThe reason behind this was because he noticed the evidence to prove that these two children were not ordinary mortals\u2014the short sword the boy was carrying!While the boy had concealed it well, Klaude was still able to discern the true identity of the sword through his keen eyes. It was one of the holy weapons that he was honored to lay his eyes upon ten years ago, when the church held a grand sermon for all clergy in the Holy Capital.Saint\u2019s Blade\u4e00Twelve Wings!And the girl was even more so formidable. While Klaude was a powerless mortal, he still noticed the divine light that shrouded the girl when she severed the door latch. Such adept control of mana could only be achieved by a transcendent who possessed an Origin Attribute, which meant that she had to be at least Origin Level 5. On top of that, the purity of her light was even greater than that of most high priests he knew of.Such great power on a mere child who appeared to be at most a ten-year-old?Heh, a holy weapon and superior transcendent powers, and you claim that you\u2019re just ordinary noble children? Yes yes, anything you say.(Affection Points +100!)Klaude nodded his head quietly at everything the boy and girl before him were saying, but on the inside, he was feeling gleeful at having seen through the disguise of the Holy Sons.O\u2019 great Sia, your grace shines on me!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I just ate not too long ago.\u201dEver since Roel and Nora arrived at the monastery, the middle-aged monk had been scrambling around to attend to their every need, not resting in the slightest. It was almost as if he was afraid of neglecting them.Feeling a pair of eyes brimming with respect and admiration staring intently at him, Roel felt a huge headache.(Affection Points +100!)What in the world is going on here?

Could it be because\u2026 I\u2019m too handsome?Roel munched on a slice of bread as he nodded his head solemnly. He felt that his guess made perfect sense. Otherwise, why would a stranger treat them so well as to even offer them precious rations?One must know that it was the entire Holy Capital that was in turmoil at the moment! Even if they were noble children, there was no guarantee that they would get a reward for returning them to their parents, especially since their parents were very possibly dead.\u201cKlaude, may I ask you a few questions?\u201d\u201cYes, of course! Feel free to ask!\u201dWhile Roel\u2019s mind was still wandering all over the place, Nora engaged in a conversation with this overly passionate monk.\u201cAre the armies fighting out there Prince Wade\u2019s and Princess Victoria\u2019s?\u201d asked Nora.This was an odd question, considering how the fighting had been going on for half a month now. It was impossible for anyone in the Holy Capital to not know of it. Klaude was understandably taken aback, but soon recovered.Of course! The Holy Sons have just descended from heaven, only to be met by such chaos. They must still be trying to grasp the situation. Oh ho, isn\u2019t this a good opportunity for me to show my worth?\u201cYou must be confused by what\u2019s happening in the city. Why don\u2019t I explain everything to you?\u201d\u201cYes, that would be much appreciated. Thank you, Klaude.\u201d\u201cNo no, this is what I ought to do!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPutting aside Roel, who could literally see affection, even Nora was starting to feel somewhat overwhelmed by just how passionate Klaude was. In the end, she chose to attribute it to his sense of righteousness.For the next few minutes, Klaude exhibited his scholarly credentials. He explained the circumstances surrounding the two factions in a clear and concise manner.The battle started at the beginning of March, and it has been ongoing for half a month now. The entire Holy Capital went into lock down and became isolated from the rest of the world. No one is allowed to enter or leave the city. It\u2019s a struggle between Prince Wade along with three allied eminent noble houses against Princess Victoria and the Theocracy\u2019s Guardian Knights and Knight Orders.The three noble houses are the Belfasts, the Weiss, and the Elrics, though to be more exact, the Belfasts and the Weiss are only playing a supporting role. The bulk of Prince Wade\u2019s strength comes from the Elrics.As for Princess Victoria, she has the support of the Ascarts, who command the Third Battalion and the Knight Orders.The two sides swiftly built their formations along the central street of the Holy Capital and faced off with one another, but it didn\u2019t take long for the bottleneck to be broken. According to the news, the patriarch of the Elric House personally led a swift and deadly strike against the flanks of Princess Victoria\u2019s forces, resulting in their defenses being breached and their formation collapsing.From then on, the battle turned from a clash into a massacre. The death toll rose swiftly every single day, and blood filled the entire Holy Capital. There were a great number of deaths on both sides, but eventually, Prince Wade\u2019s alliance still managed to destroy Princess Victoria\u2019s forces.Realizing that the situation had turned desperate for them, the patriarch of the Ascart House ordered a retreat. He pulled Princess Victoria away to his residence and cast a grand magic spell over the surroundings, filling the area with fog. Anyone who stepped into the fog would suddenly find themselves teleporting randomly around. So far, this had hindered Prince Wade\u2019s alliance from clinching the decisive victory.Currently, Princess Victoria and the remnant of her forces were holed-up within the fog, but everyone knew that this wasn\u2019t a long-term plan. It was only a matter of time before the grand spell was released. Once that happened, Prince Wade and his allies would swiftly eliminate all of them.Prince Wade had ordered the area covered by the fog to be encircled, and they were constantly sending patrol teams in to scout the area. Therefore, those who were trapped here had no choice but to hide within the shelters of their own homes and pray that Prince Wade\u2019s soldiers would overlook them.\u201cWait a moment. How are you so clear about all of this?\u201dAfter hearing Klaude\u2019s story, Roel sensed that the man knew too much. This was a medieval world they were living in, not the modern era of information, with radios and cell phones. It was hard to believe that a mere monk living in a monastery, an ordinary civilian, would actually be able to gather so much classified information.Klaude began to stutter under Roel\u2019s questioning. His eyes swam nervously around for a moment, but under the interrogative stares from the two children, he eventually caved and confessed.\u201cI am part of Princess Victoria\u2019s logistics team, but I was unable to keep up with their retreat and ended up being left behind. So, I took my own rations and sought refuge in this monastery. The bread you are eating right now is the food that I snuck away with.\u201dAh, so you\u2019re a cook who failed to keep up with your comrades\u2026Nora and Roel looked at the food in their hands speechlessly.Based on Klaude\u2019s account, by the time he got here, the grand magic spell had already been activated, confounding his sense of direction. Had it not been for his good luck, he would have never been able to make it into this monastery.In a strict sense, Klaude could be considered as a deserter, but neither Roel nor Nora, who were sharing his loot, had any intent to criticize him. After filling their stomachs and quenching their thirst, Roel felt that it was time for him to ask Klaude what his stance on this matter was.\u201cJudging by the fact that you had previously worked in Princess Victoria\u2019s army, does this mean that your allegiance is to Princess Victoria?\u201d\u201cYou can say so,\u201d replied Klaude vaguely.His not-so-resolute answer surprised the two. Given that Klaude was on Princess Victoria\u2019s side, he should have been filled with contempt for Prince Wade for colluding with evil cults.Noticing that something was amiss, Roel narrowed his eyes and probed on. He decided to cut straight to the main point.\u201cIs Prince Wade not an evil cultist?\u201d\u201cHuh? Of course not! He might be a heretic, but he\u2019s not an evil cultist. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have so many followers either,\u201d replied Klaude with genuine confusion.Nora and Roel exchanged shocked gazes with one another. A heretic and an evil cultist might sound similar to one another, but there were some differences between the two. Most heretics had abilities that brought convenience to the populace, so the Genesis Goddess Church generally turned a blind eye to them. Evil cultists, on the other hand, sought to unleash destruction upon the world and overthrow the current order.If what Klaude said about Prince Wade not being an evil cultist was true, it would mean that the history Roel knew of was riddled with flaws. A flash of insight crossed Roel\u2019s mind as he suddenly realized something.He first stopped Nora, who appeared to be on the verge of saying something, before he turned to Klaude and spoke with a grim tone.\u201cKlaude, can you elaborate in more detail about the cause of this conflict?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d replied Klaude with a nod, before heaving a deep sigh. \u201cThis will have to start from the mother of the two royal highnesses.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 - Countdown of the Witness StatePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 74: Countdown of the Witness StateLocke Street 42.Roel and Nora were currently sitting around one of the short tables the children in the monastery usually dined at. Neither of them was saying anything at all.They had just listened to the story about the prince of this country, Wade Xeclyde.Born as one of the royal twins, he was blessed with incredible gifts at birth. His intelligence allowed him to easily grasp new knowledge, and his transcendent abilities were amazing even by the standards of the talented Xeclydes.Going by the usual plotline of fantasy novels, Wade Xeclyde should have either walked down the path of success, leading the Theocracy on to defeat the Austine Empire and rise to the top of the world, or he should realize that human nature is inherently evil and fall into depravity, just like how history eventually came to depict him.But, the truth was neither.The first 12 years of Wade\u2019s life was filled with accomplishments and bliss. Everything was smooth-sailing, and it felt like it would continue so till the end of his life. Yet, everything descended into tragedy when he turned thirteen.It all stemmed from Wade and Victoria\u2019s mother, Consort Mary.Mary was born in an average viscount house in the South Sea Fiefdom. She met Prince Ryan during the banquet held for his sixteenth birthday, and the two of them fell deeply in love with one another. Prince Ryan overcame all opposition to wed Mary, and they ended up having twins together.Needless to say, the twins were none other than Wade and Victoria.Having come from a humble background, Consort Mary was especially empathetic to the suffering faced by the common folk. She loved children and had a gentle personality. She often spent her time visiting the orphanages in the Holy Capital and donated to smaller monasteries. From time to time, she would even conduct lessons for the populace.Little wonder that she was so well-loved by the citizens.However, despite her good nature, she concealed a secret that no one could learn of. She was actually a transcendent, and her Origin Attribute was not one of the Three Main Origin Attributes, which made her a heretic. This secret was made known to the public by accident when Wade and Victoria were thirteen.For the wife of the incumbent Holy Eminence to actually be a heretic\u2026 it wasn\u2019t hard to imagine how this would shake the upper echelons of the Theocracy. All sorts of conspiracy theories surfaced, and in the blink of an eye, Consort Mary suddenly became public enemy number one within the highest levels of the church and the royal court.Holy Eminence Ryan was also swept into the midst of this storm. Consort Mary had turned into the weak spot of the royal family. No one knew for sure just what kind of political strife had broken out within the royal court, but this uproar ended with Mary fading from public view. She was sent to a monastery in the Holy Capital to live her life out quietly.From then on, even though Mary still lived in the same city as the twins, they were firmly separated from one another. They never got a chance to meet once more.This could have all changed when Wade ascended to the throne and donned the holy robes, but he didn\u2019t manage to make it in time.It was when Wade was 15 that a plague broke out in the Holy Capital. The well-protected royal palace wasn\u2019t affected due to swift measures put in place, but the monastery in which Consort Mary lived happened to be one of the infected regions. In the end, in the March of Year 824, Mary succumbed to the plague and died.Just like that, a kind woman who was loved by the populace departed without anyone knowing. There was no sorrow and no funeral. It was almost as if she had never existed in the first place.This incident really agitated the young Wade.No one understood just how that 15-year-old child felt when he learned his mother had died, but he couldn\u2019t even see her off. It was not that no one tried to probe, but he didn\u2019t allow anyone to peer through his inner thoughts. All everyone saw was a diligent youth persevering in his studies and training. Compared to Victoria, who spent her days grieving over her mother\u2019s death, it looked as if he was completely unfazed.All of the nobles who had put Consort Mary down back then heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing Wade\u2019s attitude. They praised him for his wisdom at being able to see the bigger picture.Yet, they didn\u2019t understand that the more silent a person was, the more frightening he would be when he finally erupted. Wade hadn\u2019t lost his emotions; he was just sharpening his edge. He channeled all of his wrath and sorrow into motivation, the motivation to seek greater power. He bided his time and quietly grew his power while waiting for an opportunity to surface.And an opportunity finally surfaced four years later.In the March of Year 828, when Holy Eminence Ryan left the Theocracy to visit the Austine Empire, he finally drew his blade on his enemies. With a single move, he cut down half of the upper echelon of the Theocracy. None of the bishops who had insulted Mary were able to escape from his fury. He didn\u2019t give them any chance at all, just like how they hadn\u2019t given Mary a chance back then.If all Wade did was kill, he would have been no more than a butcher blinded by vengeance. However, the truth was not so. Wade\u2019s ambition went further than just exacting vengeance; he had ideals as well.\u2018Revolutionaries\u2019, that was the name of Wade\u2019s faction. It was filled with many hot-blooded youths who sought to change the rules that opposed the existence of heretics.For his goal, Wade even took on a huge risk by changing his Compassion Origin Attribute into something else, thus turning himself into a heretic. That effectively meant that Wade had turned his back on the succession of the throne. He was putting everything he had on the line; if it failed, he would have been left with nothing at all.It was the sheer determination he displayed that moved the hesitant heretics in the Theocracy to make a stand. They swiftly joined Wade\u2019s ranks, and to everyone\u2019s amazement, three of the Five Eminent Noble Houses actually chose to stand alongside him.Everything else went according to recorded history. The Revolutionaries moved with frightening speed, leaving those in the conservative faction facing a crisis before they even knew it.Victoria and Ponte were the two final fortresses of the conservative faction. As long as the Revolutionaries could capture Victoria, Wade would be in a strong position to force Holy Eminence Ryan to acknowledge the ideals of the Revolutionaries. Unless Holy Eminence Ryan could bring himself to destroy his own heritage and pass the crown down to a non-Xeclyde, he would have no choice but to accede to Wade\u2019s demands.After listening to the full story, Roel and Nora were left flabbergasted. The story they were hearing right now was simply far too different from the history they had learned.Roel himself wasn\u2019t really a believer of the Genesis Goddess Church, so he empathized more with Wade\u2019s actions, at least for the first half of the story. From his perspective, he felt that it was tragic for someone as kind as Consort Mary to end up with such a fate just because of human biases.Well killed! Those who speak of forgiveness should try losing their mom in that manner first before preaching those values!Vengeance in the face of injustice was an inherent tendency of humans. Putting the subjectivity of moral values aside, while Wade\u2019s actions were extreme, there were still many who could see things from his perspective and empathize with him.As for Prince Wade\u2019s Revolutionaries and those ideals that were mentioned in the latter half of the story, Roel couldn\u2019t really make a judgment about that, and he didn\u2019t think that he was qualified to do so either. There were no history books that spoke about that faction, and he didn\u2019t live in this era himself, so he didn\u2019t fully understand the situation or its nuances.However, based on what he had heard from Klaude, it would appear that while the ideals promoted by the Revolutionaries were shockingly progressive for the Theocracy, it was also overdue to address the issue of heretics.For the past decade, the Theocracy had been attracting more and more heretics to settle down in the country, due to the stable livelihood provided. Given their growing numbers, it would be unwise to continue overlooking them.This influx brought about both pros and cons.For the pros, these heretics were important members of the workforce. In this world where most fiefdoms suffered from underpopulation, having more workers was almost always a good thing. Furthermore, there were many skilled individuals amongst them too, making them an invaluable resource that could potentially be tapped into.However, looking at it from another perspective, the fact that their Origin Attribute wasn\u2019t stable meant that problems could occur during their evolution, resulting in them falling into depravity and turning into vile evil cultists. In reality, the line between heretic and evil cultist was blurred, so it wasn\u2019t that easy to distinguish between the two.On top of that, public security in the Holy Capital had been growing poorer over the past decade too.Hearing the truth behind the history, Roel was once more rendered speechless. However, the one who was most affected was none other than Nora. From a young age, she had viewed Victoria as her role model and strove to be like her. Yet now, what Klaude mentioned threatened to overthrow what she had believed in her whole life.4 replies\u00a0\u2013 6 hours agoNaturally, Nora didn\u2019t just take Klaude\u2019s words for granted. She posed her doubts and questioned the validity of his statements, but Klaude had an answer to that too.\u201cI know all of this because I belong to one of the monasteries here in the Holy Capital. Our small monastery is acquainted with Consort Mary,\u201d said Klaude as he reminisced about her beautiful silhouette with a look of nostalgia. \u201cShe\u2019s a good person.\u201dKlaude muttered to himself, as if trying to justify something. Seeing this, Roel pondered momentarily before finally posing a question.\u201cDo you think that Prince Wade was justified in his vengeance?\u201dThis question provoked a huge response from Klaude. The monk\u2019s first instinct was to blurt out a response, but he managed to hold himself back at the very last moment. A long period of silence lingered in the air before Klaude finally replied with a vague answer.\u201cI can empathize with how His Highness Wade feels.\u201dHis Highness Wade?Roel took some time to ponder the underlying meaning behind Klaude\u2019s words. He shot a glance at the pale-faced Nora before he moved on to pose his second question.\u201cThen do you think that Prince Wade\u2019s initiative is the right choice?\u201dKlaude\u2019s response was even bigger this time, but it was a response of uncertainty. His eyelids quivered a little as he thought over this matter. It seemed like a series of postulations and contradictions were occurring in his heart. He raised his hand up slightly in agitation, only to eventually put it down powerlessly.\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I really don\u2019t know.\u201dThis was perhaps a sentiment shared by many in this era too. Two different ideals represented two different paths the Theocracy could walk down. They were standing at a fork, and their decisions would determine their future and many others. It was too big of a decision, so much so that it frightened them, rendering them incapable of choosing.With a deep sigh, Roel concluded his questioning. He turned his head over to Nora, only to see her brooding over this matter. She appeared to be in a gloomy mood. What Klaude mentioned earlier had really shaken her.There was nothing that Roel could do to solve this, but at the very least, he could solve their physiological needs.\u201cIt\u2019s about time to sleep. We should get some rest.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dKlaude brought the two of them to separate bedrooms. After packing up a little, Roel lay down on the bed and sighed deeply.So many things had happened that it was hard to believe that it had only been half a day. Even with the \u2018steroids\u2019 he had received from the System, it was still a little too much for him to bear.Recalling the System, Roel suddenly remembered the deal he had made with it a while back regarding the loan, so he quickly took a look at the System\u2019s interface once more.His eyes widened at what he saw.\u3010Progress of Bloodline Awakening: 60%\u3011\u3010Countdown to the end of Witness State: 73 hours 55 minutes\u3011\u3010Evaluation: Average (59)\u3011Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hearing the call, the young man opened his eyes and calmly sat up.He had lustrous golden hair and a beautiful face, but those did little to mellow down his sharp, solemn, sapphire eyes. With his light armor donned, he emanated an air of valiance.Wade Xeclyde, the first in line to succeed the throne of the Saint Mesit Theocracy, as well as the highest commander of the allied armies.\u201cFelder, what time is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already 6 in the evening, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 Speaking of which, is there a need for a marquess like you to wake me up personally?\u201d replied Wade as he looked at the young knight standing before him.Anyone who didn\u2019t know better might have thought that the young knight was a logistical soldier attending to Wade, but in truth, he was actually one of the marquesses of the Theocracy, a powerhouse who wielded immense military might in his hands.Felder Elric, the patriarch of the Elric Marquess House, one of the Five Eminent Noble Houses. He was only in his twenties, but he was already a powerful Origin Level 3 transcendent. He was also Wade\u2019s closest aide and friend.Regardless of which country one was in, any transcendent who was able to reach Origin Level 3 was considered to be a top-notch expert. The gap between Origin Level 3 and Origin Level 4 was considerable, such that tens of thousands of transcendents found themselves never able to overcome this boundary.Felder was a certified genius to be able to reach this height at such a young age. His talents ranked at the top amongst the nobles. On top of that, the Elric House was also currently the strongest amongst the Five Eminent Noble Houses, making Felder one of the most powerful figures in the Theocracy.Yet, Felder showed no disrespect to the young man who had just awoken from his slumber. In response to the latter\u2019s question, he placed his fist on his chest and bowed slightly.\u201cOf course, it\u2019s my honor,\u201d said Felder with an earnest smile.He might have been considered a prodigy by his peers, but compared to the young man sitting before him, all of his accomplishments seemed like nothing in comparison.Wade Xeclyde was a man of many talents despite his young age too. He had learned his martial arts from one of the royal knights of Knight Kingdom Pendor, and his reputation was widely known amongst the scholars of Brolne too. By his 18th birthday, he had already reached Origin Level 3.Such a liege was someone Felder deemed worthy of serving, not to mention that Wade shared the same ambitions and dreams that he did.\u201cHow is the search for Victoria going?\u201d\u201cThere are no results for the time being. As we had guessed, she has gone into hiding with Ponte. I believe that she has no intention of fighting us anymore.\u201dWade was much more energized after two hours of rest. He glanced out the window and looked at the fog-shrouded region not too far away.Ever since Ponte set up this labyrinth, Wade and Felder had only been sleeping 2 hours every day. They took turns leading the armies into the labyrinth to search the area, with Felder taking the morning shift and Wade taking the night shift. They were pushing themselves beyond the limits and exhausting themselves, but they were still unable to get a handle on the enemy\u2019s location.\u201cTime isn\u2019t in our favor. We can\u2019t drag it out any longer, or else an issue might crop up with the Holy Eminence. Do you have any good ideas on how we should handle this situation?\u201d\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t thought of\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Highness, emergency military report!\u201dA soldier suddenly barged in and interrupted Felder\u2019s words. However, the two of them didn\u2019t lose their temper due to it; instead, a smile broke out on their faces. There weren\u2019t any enemy formations in the labyrinth at all, so any emergency military report couldn\u2019t possibly be about an attack. If so, there was only one possibility\u2026\u201cIn the depths of Locke Street, we found a reaction to the royal bloodline. It\u2019s Princess Victoria!\u201d\u2026\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is this tool malfunctioning?\u201dIn a beautifully decorated room, a black-haired man looked at the detection tool on his table and frowned. This royal bloodline tracking device was an invaluable magic tool, and there were only three people in the world who had it. The one that the man had in his hand at the moment belonged to Princess Victoria Xeclyde.In other words, it was the possession of his pupil.This black-haired man went by the name of Ponte, and he was the patriarch of the Ascart House. He had chosen to take the side of his pupil in this battle, and with his help, they managed to build up a defense line and stabilize the situation.Unfortunately, this didn\u2019t last long as their defensive line was soon breached.There was nothing that he could do about this. Prince Wade was already a fearsome opponent on his own, and the backing of the Elric House\u2019s patriarch only made him even more unstoppable.Even Ponte, despite having reached the peak of Origin Level 3 and already on the verge of making a breakthrough to Origin Level 2, had to admit that they were indeed monstrously talented youths.Yes, very different from this spoiled princess with a nasty personality!, retorted Ponte as he snuck a glance at the woman sitting on the sofa behind him.She was a woman who looked like an angel. Her beautiful looks and her graceful demeanor made her an unforgettable silhouette in the hearts of many. Ponte\u2019s eyes scanned the sleeping beauty from head to toe before taking out his little booklet and began writing down:Today\u2019s Victoria is like an angel too, but her chest hasn\u2019t been developing over the past few months. What a pity.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter writing down those words, Ponte closed his booklet and sighed deeply. His actions may appear weird to others, but he was really not a \u2018man of culture\u2019 who went about writing perverted diaries!This was actually the price he had to pay for his magic spells as a Wisdom Origin Level 3 Chronicler.Transcendents had to pay a price for their powers. Evil cultists usually had to take the lives of others whereas heretics differed from case to case. In comparison, the Three Main Origin Attributes that were deemed to be more suitable for humans had a lower price to pay.For Ponte, the price was to record reality down. However, the issue over here was that the \u2018reality\u2019 he had to record wasn\u2019t a transcript of events but the reality of being a man.\u201cAre you writing those stuff again?\u201dThe whisperings coming from behind made Ponte\u2019s body stiffen. Victoria had already woken up, and she was looking at him playfully with an arm propping up her head.\u201cTo actually be interested in your pupil\u2019s body, you sure are perverted. I would love to hear the contents of your diaries one day. Personally from your mouth, that is,\u201d said the golden-haired woman with a bright smile on her face.Ponte sighed deeply in response. His pupil was quite an incredible person, having both the aptitude and character to achieve great things in the future. It was just that she had a weird sadistic streak that loved seeing him in a troubled position.\u201cHeh, that\u2019s a good expression you have there. I would love to continue teasing you, but let\u2019s stop with this for now. I\u2019ll hold myself back for the time being.\u201dSeeing that Victoria had decided to stop her offense, Ponte exhaled deeply in relief. He placed his pen down, turned to her, and said.\u201cVictoria, come and have a look at this. Your magic tool appears to be acting up.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dVictoria stood up and walked over to take a look at the magic tool on the table. Her eyebrows slowly furrowed as she saw two unmoving red dots on it.\u201cLocke Street? Who could this be?\u201d muttered Victoria to herself full of doubts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Carter had never spoken much about the values of the Ascart House. His usual lectures were just the usual stuff about how a nobleman should act and the sort; there was nothing special at all.\u201cIsn\u2019t this problem too tough?

In the end, he could only shake his hand in the air and toss the questions to the back of his mind.Roel stared at the 60% written on the System\u2019s interface as he quickly calculated how long it would take before time\u2019s up. Considering that the awakening started earlier in the evening and it was now late at night, after the chat they had with Klaude, there was a good chance that his awakening would already be complete by the time he opened his eyes tomorrow morning!\u201cEyy, if only it was that easy!\u201dRoel sighed deeply.He knew that the awakening couldn\u2019t possibly be so simple, especially since the System deemed it to be \u2018Extremely Dangerous\u2019 and that the success rate was only 70%. These two pieces of information constantly dampened his mood.He was already halfway through his awakening, but he hadn\u2019t experienced anything yet. He wasn\u2019t sure whether this meant that everything was going smoothly or that the danger had yet to come, but in any case, all he could do was mentally prepare himself to deal with whatever might occur.To be honest, he was already throwing everything to luck since it didn\u2019t seem like there was anything much he could do about the awakening. He had already resolved himself for the worst when he made that decision.\u201cCome to think of it, there\u2019s still 73 hours till the end of this \u2018dungeon\u2019. Is there anything that I need to do? What in the world is the \u2018Witness\u2019?\u201dRoel pondered as he stared at the numbers reflected on the System interface. While he was deep in thought, his consciousness gradually faded, and unknowingly, he fell into a deep sleep.\u2026With gritted teeth, Peter Kater wrapped both his hands around the sword that was plunged into his thigh and pulled it out. At the moment that the sword was extracted, he yelped in pain as blood spurted all over his clothes.Having one\u2019s femoral artery sliced was no joke. The sheer blood loss could easily take away an ordinary human\u2019s life within a few minutes. However, transcendents had many ways of coping with such a situation.For those who had recovery-type abilities, such an injury didn\u2019t pose a threat at all, but even for those who didn\u2019t have such means, they could still control their flesh to significantly reduce blood loss. For an Origin Level 4 transcendent like Peter, such a trick was, of course, well within his means.\u201cYowch! Damn it! Those two damn scamps!\u201d cursed Peter under his breath as he held his thigh tightly.Peter channeled his mana outward, and three paintings materialized around him. One of them was the \u2018Smiling Mother\u2019 painting that Roel and Nora had seen previously, the second painting depicted a group of girls bathing in a river, and the last one was a noblewoman pulling a pet dog by the leash.All of these three paintings, by Roel\u2019s standards, looked like things that had crept out from the depths of hell. All of the characters depicted in the painting had empty holes for their eyes, nostrils, ears, and mouth.In the second painting, the river which the women were bathing in was filled with blood. In the third painting, the dog on a leash was filled with bloody pus on its face, and the noblewoman holding onto the leash looked dried out and withered.Peter Kater\u2019s reddened eyes moved waveringly amongst the three paintings. He took a look at the deep cut on his shoulder and thigh, and in the end, he grit his teeth and cast a spell on the painting with women bathing in the river of blood.\u3010ScapegoatTransfer the wounds you have suffered onto an artwork\u3011This was a recovery method unique to Peter Kater, though there are plenty of similar skills amongst evil cultists too.In the next instant, a mist of blood burst forth from the painting Peter had selected. A deep cut appeared on the thighs of the bathing women, and shrieks of agony sounded out loudly. The color of the river grew even more vibrantly crimson.In comparison, Peter\u2019s injuries began to recover. In just a few moments, the damage to his thigh had vanished without a trace. Seeing this, he heaved a sigh of relief before slowly releasing his grip on his thigh.While Scapegoat was a powerful ability, it had its limitations too. After transferring the damage, he would be unable to use the painting for the next week. On top of that, this spell could only remove a single injury, so the injury on his shoulder hadn\u2019t healed yet.Peter Kater raised his reddened eyes once more and assessed the two other paintings floating in midair around him. The colors of \u2018Smiling Mother\u2019 looked a lot more faded than before, and the noblewoman walking a dog picture had distorted significantly too. The earlier battle had been harsh not just on Peter but his paintings too.\u201cI need to find more women\u2019 skin, or else\u2026\u201d muttered Peter to himself.His strength was built upon his artwork, but these artworks weren\u2019t so convenient as to be able to be used forever. On the contrary, they were as brittle as ordinary artworks. In order to sustain them, Peter would have to continue killing living beings who resembled the characters in his paintings and graft their skin over.This was also where his title as the Skin Grafter came from.Peter had no idea where he currently was, but he could tell that a war had broken out here. There were many soldier squads patrolling the area. An evil cultist like him couldn\u2019t afford to get checked by anyone here. As a result, every single time he encountered someone, a fight would ensue.To make things worse, there was not a single woman here at all, which meant that he couldn\u2019t repair his paintings! This made Peter extremely nervous. For the first time, he regretted having taken on this mission, though he was more furious at the boy who had landed him in this state.\u201cThat wretched bastard! If not for him\u2026 Damn it, I swear that I\u2019ll skin him alive and plaster him on my paintings!\u201dJust thinking about Roel was more than enough to make Peter clutch his hair in a frenzy. The sheer intensity of his madness instilled fear in anyone looking at him. However, a few seconds later, he regained his calm.\u201cYes, I have to find them. I\u2019ll kill that brat to quench my fury. The Ascarts do have a long history behind them. If I use him in my painting, I should be able to rise to Origin Level 3. These lousy soldiers don\u2019t pose a threat to me anyway!\u201dPeter continued gritting his teeth and muttering to himself as he walked through his foggy surroundings. He turned to the noblewoman holding onto the leash of a dog and instructed.\u201cEva, find them with your dog!\u201dWith a loud roar, the skinny noblewoman holding onto a dog leash walked out of the painting. The hideous hellhound began sniffing the labyrinth before heading off in a certain direction. Peter, clutching his shoulder, quickly followed the hellhound and disappeared in the fog.\u2026Roel had a nightmare.In the dream, he was walking on top of scarlet ground. There was no water or trees anywhere; everything within sight was scarlet in color. The ground felt like gravel, but no pebbles moved when the wind blew past him.How weird, Roel thought to himself in the dream.His fuzzy brain had barely any capacity for thought too. He simply looked at the scarlet ground, listened to the whistling of the wind, and trudged forward without any thought. It was almost as if he was a lifeless zombie driven by sheer instinct.He couldn\u2019t sense anything else, and his body knew nothing of exhaustion either. He didn\u2019t know where he was headed or what his aim was, but he continued walking on for a long, long time.It felt like there was no end to his journey. The sun in the sky neither rose nor fell, creating an impression that time had stopped in this world. Like a perpetual machine, he trudged on and on, and finally, he arrived at the endpoint.It was the boundary of this scarlet world, displaying a battlefield that had long concluded. Heads as big as houses were half-buried within the gravel. Rusty swords as high as towers were stabbed into the ground. Murders of crows circled the sky as they gazed down upon Roel.At the center of this mess, there was a humongous skeleton that towered like a mountain sitting on the ground. A sword had pierced through its chest. It was cloaked in a ragged cape, and the crown sitting on its head had already long lost its luster. Yet, the skeleton remained imposing and divine like a god.In the instant Roel laid eyes upon that skeleton, an indescribably excruciating pain suddenly jabbed his nerves, electrifying his numbed mind. The extreme discomfort jolted him back to his senses, and he snapped out of his daze.At the same time, the eye sockets of the humongous skeleton lit up with a faint glow.\u201cWho is it?\u201dAn ancient and deep voice reverberated loudly in the air.The skeleton\u2019s gaze moved downward and locked eyes with the shocked Roel. As their gazes connected with one another, Roel suddenly felt that searing pain in his eyes once more. A faint light formed on the surface of his eyes momentarily before he shut them while emitting a cry of agony.\u201cI see. It\u2019s you lot again.\u201dThe humongous skeleton seemed to have understood something from observing the screaming child standing before him. His voice sounded disappointed, but at the same time, seemed to carry traces of anticipation too.\u201cHm? It\u2019s a young lad this time around?\u201dThe skeleton assessed Roel\u2019s appearance in surprise, but the fluctuations in his emotions were so minor as to be negligible.\u201cVery well, lad. Answer my question.\u201d\u201cW-what?\u201d\u201cHow do the dead pass down their power?\u201dThe ancient, deep voice resounded in Roel\u2019s ears, but the suffering boy, who was still covering both his eyes, couldn\u2019t understand the question. He tried his best to raise his head, only to see that the humongous skeleton had already averted its gaze. Turning its eyes toward the setting sun, it remarked.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to answer my question right away. You may take some time to think about it first.\u201d1 reply\u00a0\u2013 1 hour agoHis voice was calm and placid, seemingly carrying no expectations for Roel\u2019s answer at all. A moment later, he seemed to sense something once more, and he said.\u201cYou appear to have encountered some trouble. Return. However, remember to bring me an answer the next time you come.\u201dAfter those words were spoken, Roel found everything before him fading to black once more.\u2026\u201cHaaa!\u201dIn a monk\u2019s cell in the old monastery, the sleeping Roel suddenly shot awake and gasped desperately for air while clutching his blanket tightly. His head was already drenched in a layer of sweat, and his eyes looked unfocused and frantic. It looked as if he had just been jolted awake from a nightmare.And, that was exactly what Roel thought too.\u201cHuu! So it\u2019s a dream after all! That scared me!\u201dRoel was just about to lie back down and rest some more when he noticed a notification from the System. His body immediately stiffened as he gasped in shock.\u3010\u2019First Encounter\u2019 completed.\u3011\u3010Calculating results\u2026\u3011Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What does that mean?Roel\u2019s drowsiness was immediately dispelled by those words from the System. With widened eyes, he recalled the vivid dream he just had, and cold sweat drenched his back.S-surely not, right? I mean, aren\u2019t dreams usually used as prophetic materials? Or could it be that such dream foreshadowing is too clich\u00e9 nowadays, so they are skipping right ahead to the main event?Roel gripped his blanket tightly. The bed in the monastery was already hard enough as it was, and now he was faced with such an outrageous situation. How was he supposed to fall asleep like that?He stared at the System\u2019s \u2018Calculating results\u2026\u2019 many thoughts whirling in his mind. Considering how this System often preached about freedom and that sort of stuff, it was safe to assume that it wouldn\u2019t proactively create events for him. The earlier dream must be a result of some kind of change Roel was undergoing.There was another thing that caught his attention too.\u3010Progress of Bloodline Awakening: 80%\u3011It had been two hours since he fell asleep earlier on, so it wasn\u2019t that surprising to see that his bloodline awakening had already reached such a level. However, there was a new issue right n ow\u2014the number wasn\u2019t changing anymore. The awakening had halted.Roel could roughly fathom a guess as to why that was so.Do I have to answer that question first?, he wondered.Meanwhile, there were some updates over on the System\u2019s side too.\u3010Ding!\u3011\u3010Information refreshed. The user has received a unique status\u3011\u3010Grandar\u2019s PromiseYou have made a promise with the king to bring it back to reality.Effects: Amplifies your strength significantly, grants temporary invulnerability (Lasts for 30 seconds)Remaining Uses: 3\u3011\u201cInvulnerability?!\u201dRoel exclaimed in shock upon seeing the notification on his screen. He had never thought that the skeleton would actually grant him a spell.Holy shit! What in the world is that humongous skeleton? This is way too overpowered!However, just thinking of the question posed by the skeleton brought a frown back to Roel\u2019s face.How do the dead pass down their power?Roel really had no idea what that was all about. In this world filled with transcendents, the concept of \u2018dead\u2019 was very different from his previous world.Take the skeleton in his dream for example. With a sword plunged through its chest, it would appear that he had died on the battlefield fending off his enemies. However, could the humongous skeleton really be considered as \u2018dead\u2019, especially since he could talk and move?That was really hard to say.Besides, what did the \u2018power\u2019 that was mentioned refer to? Skills? Bloodline? Knowledge?Roel scratched his head but the question appeared to be far too complicated for him to give a concise answer to. Soon enough though, another matter caught his attention\u2014the skeleton had mentioned that he was in trouble.A frown formed on Roel\u2019s forehead as he got an ominous omen. Before he could really think about it, he heard footsteps outside, and Klaude rushed in through the door anxiously.\u201cThis is bad, Ho\u2014Lord Roel! Lady Nora is ill!\u201cI-I noticed her collapsed beside the table when I was heading to the loo just now. There was a cup on the floor beside her; she appeared to have been in the middle of having some water when she suddenly fainted. I tried calling her, but she isn\u2019t reacting at all. When I touched her forehead, I realized that she was burning up! So, I quickly carried her here to you!\u201d cried Klaude.\u201cAlright, I got it. Don\u2019t panic.\u201d\u201cUhm, a-alright!\u201dKlaude took deep breaths as he replied, but he was unable to completely rid himself of his jitters.Could it be because I fed mortal food to the Holy Son that caused her to end up in such a state?Such weird thoughts filled Klaude\u2019s mind. Unable to bear with the unease, he placed Nora on Roel\u2019s bed before rushing off to the prayer room to pray for her.Meanwhile, Roel placed a wet towel on her head. He couldn\u2019t help but blame himself for having neglected her. He had known that she was feeling unwell for a long time now, but he subconsciously thought little of it.Now that he thought about it, it was obvious that Nora had been behaving rather strangely before heading off to sleep. All this while, she had been bearing with her discomfort, never uttering a single word of complaint to Roel at all, but he took her resilience for granted.He had a strong feeling that Nora was really undergoing a bloodline awakening, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to rejoice over this situation. The situation was simply too dangerous at the moment.Most of the bloodline awakenings of the Xeclydes happened under the supervision of an elder, who would guide and support them through the procedure. However, that was clearly impossible right now. Forget about the guiding elder, they didn\u2019t even have anyone to protect them!Roel really had no idea what Holy Eminence John was thinking of. Why did he throw the two of them here? While it did allow them to escape from Peter Kater\u2019s ability, their circumstances still appeared to be not much better than before. Their lives were still in danger at every moment.On top of that, there\u2019s still another 60 hours more before they could leave this area.\u201cThe circumstances are really bad. What should we do about this\u2026\u201d muttered Roel to himself in frustration.He wasn\u2019t a doctor; he had no idea what he could do to help Nora. On the other hand, upon hearing Roel\u2019s words, Nora\u2019s eyes fluttered open a little.\u201cThe only ones who can guide me through my awakening are my ancestors\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re awake? How are you feeling?\u201d asked Roel anxiously.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t feel too good. Am I ill? I\u2019ve never felt this way before.\u201dNora observed her feeble self and smiled bitterly. As a treasured princess of the Theocracy, she had doctors keeping a close eye on her health from a young age. Furthermore, her Angel\u2019s Bloodline granted her a superior constitution, this had led to her never falling sick even once in the ten years of her life.But right now, her body was feeling so heavy, it was suddenly hot one moment and cold the next, and her consciousness seemed to be drifting in and out. All of these were experiences she had never had before, and it made her terrified. The weakening of her body resulted in the weakening of her will as well.She stared at the dark and unadorned ceiling above her, and for the first time, she wondered if she could really get out of here.\u201cMy body has already been in this state for a night now. Even though I\u2019ve used spells to reduce my sensitivity to pain and sharpen my will, it looks like I\u2019m only delaying the inevitable. If only I knew this would happen, I would have at least learned a recovery spell\u2026\u201d remarked Nora bitterly.Due to her personality, she had always preferred powerful offensive spells, which led to her lack of interest in recovery spells. Yet, this bias of hers ended up biting her back.Listening to Nora\u2019s words, Roel knew that her condition was not something that a non-professional could solve. She needed the help of a transcendent to heal her, but given the current situation\u2026 Roel could only clench his fists tightly together.He took out the only thing that appeared to be useful in this monastery.\u201cDrink this bottle of medicine. It should at least be of some help.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m too weak to get up.\u201dSo, Roel stepped forward and carefully propped Nora up before leaning her against his chest. He uncorked the bottle and brought it over to her lips.\u201cCome, drink it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHm? Nora?\u201dRoel was surprised by the lack of action from his patient. As he was behind her, he couldn\u2019t see her furiously blushing face and the hesitation that was written all over it.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did I hurt you?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s something else.\u201d\u201cHm? What is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026 It feels a little weird. As compared to being fed, I think I prefer to be the one doing the feeding instead,\u201d answered Nora reluctantly.That answer made Roel grind his teeth in exasperation.Sis, TPO! Which is more important, your life or maintaining that sadistic front of yours?\u201cCan\u2019t you control yourself a little?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like I said that I\u2019m not going to drink it.\u201d\u201cCut the crap and drink it!\u201d\u201cWuwuwuuu!\u201dThe frustrated Roel stuffed the bottle into Nora\u2019s mouth and completely disregarded her opposition. Left with no choice, she could only swallow the entire bottle of medicine down.\u201cY-you traitorous subject! How dare you treat me in such a manner!\u201dInfuriated, Little Miss Angel criticized Roel\u2019s tyrannical actions furiously, but he simply smiled casually behind her back in response.\u201cMy liege, have you forgotten that you haven\u2019t donned the crown yet?\u201d\u201cSo what? Aren\u2019t you afraid that I\u2019ll kill you in the future?\u201d\u201cHeh, I\u2019ll just stage a revolt then.\u201dWhile bickering with Nora, Roel slightly backed away, hoping to lay her back down on the bed. Unexpectedly, Nora grabbed onto him lightly and stopped him.\u201cT-this is fine. Don\u2019t move.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cThe bed is too hard,\u201d replied the golden-haired girl with a reddened face.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euRoel shot a glance at the rock hard bed before nodding contemplatively.Indeed, children of esteemed lineage grow up sleeping in feather quilts, so it\u2019s only natural that they aren\u2019t able to get used to such a hard bed. Forget about Nora, even I feel a little uncomfortable sleeping here.So, Roel stopped what he was doing and allowed Nora to continue lying on his chest quietly. The two of them listened to each other\u2019s breathing and heartbeats while waiting for the medicine to take effect.Nora looked at everything before her. The renovation in the monastery was old and basic. As a building made out of stone, it was inevitable that the place would become cold at night. The only source of illumination here was the candlelight on the table, but even that felt like it would soon be devoured by the darkness of the night.Looking at this scenery that was vastly different from the extravagant palace she was used to, she felt a little dazed, as if she was inside a dream.Nora stared at this dark room for a long moment while enjoying the warmth on her back. All of a sudden, she spoke up.\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to hate me as much anymore.\u201d\u201cI have never hated you.\u201d\u201cLiar.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d replied Roel.He unwittingly thought about Nora\u2019s actions back at the art studio with Peter Kater earlier. Her unyielding spirit to uphold her principles had moved him, and that had in turn changed some of the thoughts in his mind.\u201cBack then, I was just a little\u2026 Never mind, but it\u2019s not like that anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026 To be honest, I was thinking that even if you do hate me, it\u2019s not that bad either.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRoel frowned at Nora\u2019s words. Somehow, he felt that there was something amiss about her.However, Nora didn\u2019t respond. Instead, she stared ahead blankly, seemingly thinking of something. It was a long while later that she tilted her head slightly toward Roel and spoke.\u201cYou should leave tomorrow at dawn.\u201d\u201cYeah, I was thinking the same too. I\u2019ll carry you.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m saying that you should leave by yourself,\u201d said Nora calmly as she looked at Roel\u2019s face. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to get out of here if you bring me with you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, Nora remained perfectly calm.\u201cI\u2019m just speaking the truth. You are also aware of it deep down. Given our current situation, it\u2019s impossible for you to bring me along with you,\u201d she replied with a bitter smile.Roel saw something in her that was different than her usual demeanor\u2014despondence. It was an emotion he thought that he would never see from her. It felt like she was drowning in despair but was still trying to pull herself together to say farewell to him with a smile.\u201cDon\u2019t bother with me. You\u2019ll lose your life needlessly if you stay with me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense. I can\u2019t possibly leave you here alone.\u201d\u201cWhat else can you do then? Carry me out of here? In this labyrinth filled with dangers?\u201dNora chuckled wryly to herself as she shook her head.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. You won\u2019t even be able to run when you encounter soldiers. We have no identities in this era, so nothing good will come out of being captured.\u201dRoel\u2019s mood became heavy. Prince Wade was aiming to use his identity as \u2018the only successor\u2019 as leverage against the current Holy Eminence to force him to accede to his demands. Therefore, both Victoria and Nora were impediments to him as their Xeclyde bloodlines granted them a claim to the throne.Of course, this fact meant that Victoria\u2019s forces would welcome their presence, but could they even reach them? They had no way of getting to Victoria and Ponte given the labyrinth they were in.\u201cBesides, don\u2019t forget that there\u2019s someone out for our lives right now. Peter won\u2019t let us off for getting him embroiled in this. He\u2019ll surely do everything he can to get to us. An irony, don\u2019t you think? It\u2019s a pity that we don\u2019t know the way out of here either.\u201dA smile of ridicule surfaced on Nora\u2019s face as she seemed to foresee the ending awaiting that inhuman beast. But soon afterward, she turned back to Roel and emphasized once more calmly.\u201cIf you bring me with you, the two of us will die together.\u201dRoel stared at Nora\u2019s sapphire eyes as many expressions flickered across his face. Deep down, he knew what Nora said was true. He had enough sense in him to figure that out. However, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to leave behind an utterly powerless Nora here all alone. Not after what she had done for him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDon\u2019t give up so easily. It\u2019s at times like this that we should try to think of a way out.\u201d\u201cA way out? Are you able to figure out a way to carry me out of this place, when soldiers can appear out of thin air, and an evil cultist is hot on our tail? No, there\u2019s no way out of this. Even if the two of us were in our top condition, there\u2019s still nothing we can do about this.\u201dNora\u2019s logical response left Roel with no words to refute her, but that didn\u2019t mean that he was convinced by her argument. In fact, his silence and the obstinacy in his eyes told Nora of his intention clearly.\u2026 What a fool.Nora turned her head away, choosing not to look at him anymore. Her scattered golden hair covered her lowered face slightly, concealing the tears brimming in her eyes and the joy rippling through her heart.(Affection Points +2000!)This is the first time,Nora thought.She clearly wanted to ask him to leave, yet she couldn\u2019t help but feel delighted and moved by his refusal. She felt guilty over her feelings of joy, but at the same time, an unprecedented feeling of assurance embraced her too.Looks like death isn\u2019t that frightening after all. What\u2019s more frightening is having to die alone, she thought wryly.\u201c5th of June, the day of my baptism. Remember this date well, June 5th,\u201d said Nora gently as she leaned powerlessly on Roel\u2019s chest. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely, but if my father and grandfather direct their fury at you, tell them this date. The day of baptism is something that is only told to those closest to you. They\u2019ll understand once they hear it.\u201dClosest to me?Roel\u2019s face began to twitch a little, and he had to give his all to prevent it from cramping up. He blinked his eyes, thinking that he should probably say something in response, but he had no idea what. In the end, he was simply left with an uncomfortable feeling, as if a small bone was stuck in his throat.Some time later, the medicine took effect and Nora fell asleep.\u201cLord Roel, is Lady Nora fine?\u201d\u201cYes. She has fallen asleep after drinking some medicine.\u201dOutside the room, Klaude, who had been praying all this while, came by to enquire Nora\u2019s current condition. The graveness the monk felt was significantly alleviated after hearing Roel\u2019s answer. However, he was still a little worried about the matter.\u201cThis monastery used to have a nun who specializes in recovery spells, but she was taken back by her family before the battle began. All that is left are some fever and sleeping medicines. I don\u2019t know if they are really useful or not.\u201d\u201cThey are useful. Thank you for your help, Klaude.\u201d\u201cNo no, it\u2019s all for our great goddess!\u201d said Klaude as he patted his chest in agitation.If he could help the two Holy Sons who descended on the world, that would be equivalent to helping the goddess herself. It was a huge merit he was making here! It was just that he was feeling a little confused as to what kind of illness one of the Holy Sons was afflicted with. She was clearly fine when they chatted earlier.\u201cLord Roel, if I may ask, where does Lady Nora\u2019s illness stem from?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 She injured herself while fighting with an evil cultist. She was trying to hold it in earlier.\u201d\u201cI see!\u201d exclaimed Klaude in astonishmentAs expected! The Holy Sons only suffered injuries from fighting against the dark powers of the continent. Those underhanded rats must have resorted to some sort of despicable means! Hah! May their bowels loosen and fall incontinent!Klaude roared furiously in his mind. If not for his lacking strength, he might have just rushed out the door right now to clear away those evil cultists with his own hands!Roel watched the expressions flickering across Klaude\u2019s face and wondered if it would be appropriate to interrupt the monk\u2019s train of thoughts.\u201cKlaude? Are you listening?\u201d\u201cAh, yes yes, I\u2019m listening! Lord Roel, do you have any instructions for me?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so polite. It\u2019s just that\u2026 things might get chaotic soon. So, I hope that you can remain in this room and protect Nora. Don\u2019t come out no matter what you hear, or else things could get dangerous.\u201d\u201cChaotic? Could it be\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. I suspect that our enemies will chase us here.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 Alright, I understand. I\u2019ll bring some food and weapons here to protect Lady Nora by her side!\u201dHearing that evil cultists might come knocking very soon, Klaude\u2019s face turned pale as he quickly began to busy himself with preparations. He had barely fought during his life, so all he had was a standard issue sword from his role as a soldier. It was last sharpened a year ago, so it would probably only suffice for killing a chicken now. To summarize, his fighting prowess was something Roel bore zero expectations for.However, that was fine too, since Roel hadn\u2019t intended on relying on Klaude in the first place. Actually, there was no basis behind his worries other than the dream he just had, but he was the kind of person to prepare for the worst.In his dream, that mountain-like skeleton known as Grandar mentioned that he was in trouble. Considering how the other party had granted him such a powerful spell on their first meeting, it seemed pretty meaningless for him to lie on such a matter. Most likely, he just wanted him not to die too quickly, so that he could get the answer he wanted.Roel\u2019s initial thought was that the \u2018trouble\u2019 referred to Nora\u2019s illness, but the more he thought about it, the more he felt that that wasn\u2019t it.Grandar\u2019s Promise was a powerful spell that granted him invulnerability for a short period of time. No matter how one looked at it, it was definitely a combat spell. Surely, Grandar hadn\u2019t given him such a spell to fight against an already incapacitated Nora, right?Without a doubt, he was supposed to use this spell to deal with some other enemy. As for who this enemy was, Roel had a pretty good guess on that.\u201cPeter Kater\u2026\u201dRoel muttered the name of his enemy as he clenched his fists tightly.Truthfully, Roel had a deeper reason why he felt guilt toward Nora that she didn\u2019t know about.Nora might not have found anything wrong about them getting attacked by an evil cultist, but Roel himself knew he was the cause of it all. He knew very well that this assassination hadn\u2019t happened in the original plotline ofEyes of the Chronicler. In the first place, Peter\u2019s target was him, not Nora. This was already revealed by his spell, Calamity of Bloodshed.His actions had caused huge changes to occur in the future, changing the original plotline surrounding the Theocracy.In his bid to remove his death flags, he unintentionally placed Nora in danger. It was because she wanted to be with him that she left the safety of the royal palace to stay at the Labyrinth Villa on the first night of the new year. That resulted in her getting embroiled in the assassination attempt.It was less than a single day, but Roel saw many different sides to Nora, be it her kindness, her unyielding spirit, or her frailty. He knew deep down that he couldn\u2019t abandon her, or else he would never be able to live with the regret.So, he drew his silver short sword and glanced at the blade. A pair of composed but imposing golden eyes, filled with killing intent, stared back at him.He stood up and headed to the doorway of the monastery. There, an oil lamp swung creakily under the cold night breeze. He began making his way toward the unknown darkness and disappeared within it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - Battle in the MonasteryPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 79: Battle in the MonasteryA person should know their limits.This was a saying that Roel felt was appropriate to be used anywhere regardless of the circumstances, and this was especially so in a world where transcendent powers were possible. Knowing what one was capable of allowed one to make correct choices in the face of trouble.\u201cIf you fail to plan, you plan to fail,\u201d muttered Roel.He had always believed in making careful preparations before doing anything. Before taking action, he had already thought out the possible situations and made countermeasures for them accordingly. It might have been a hot-blooded gamble driven by emotions, but it was definitely not blind recklessness.Assuming that the \u2018trouble\u2019 that was coming for them was really Skin Grafter Peter Kater, it would mean that he had managed to overcome the platoon of soldiers from back then. In that platoon, three of them were at Origin Level 5 and the rest were Origin Level 6s. By this gauge, it should be safe to assume that Peter\u2019s strength was at Origin Level 4.It was unlikely for his level to be any higher, since that would mean that had to be Origin Level 3. Remember that Origin Level 3 marked a high-level transcendent, a being who possessed immeasurable power. If he was really that powerful, there was no way he would have faced any difficulties trying to deal with those soldiers.Also, Nora likely had no confidence in defeating Peter, considering how she reacted back at the art studio. With her Angel\u2019s Bloodline, she was far stronger than ordinary transcendents of the same level. She even had the possibility of challenging some Origin Level 4s.Through using such comparisons, Roel concluded that Peter Kater\u2019s strength was at the stronger side amongst Origin Level 4s, probably like a C+ by the System\u2019s standards. This meant that he was two whole levels stronger than Roel.It was typically impossible for an Origin Level 6 to defeat an Origin Level 4, but after careful consideration, Roel felt that he still stood a chance.Peter Kater was certainly powerful, but he had one weakness\u2014he was a pure magician. This could be seen from his attitude when he showed-off his art studio, as well as the way he defended himself when dealing with the attacks from the platoon of soldiers earlier. He displayed ordinary physical prowess and even ended up getting stabbed in his thigh.If one were to just look at his constitution by itself, it was at most on par with an Origin Level 5 close-combat warrior. Perhaps, he might even be physically weaker than Roel too!Furthermore, after the bitter battle he had been through, it was likely that he was in a weakened state. After all, the transcendent abilities in this world all came at a price, especially for evil cultists. This could be seen from the battles between the Theocracy and the evil cults.Roel once heard from Carter that the Theocracy rarely had the upper ground when facing off with evil cultists right from the start. The evil cultists tended to have exceptionally powerful offensive transcendent abilities, which made it hard to face them straight on.However, as long as they dragged the battle out, the scales would swiftly tip in the Theocracy\u2019s favor. In fact, there were times where the cultists would die on their own from being unable to foot the price of their own abilities!Living life to the extreme, this was the fundamental nature of evil cults.Taking all of these factors into consideration, a plan was slowly taking shape in Roel\u2019s mind. The key to whether he could achieve victory basically hinged on two factors\u2014whether he was able to get close enough to Peter, and whether he was able to wield sufficient attack prowess to break Peter\u2019s defense.He looked at the silver short sword in his hand. It was going to be his trump card tonight.As a holy weapon, it was the bane of all evil cultists. The defense of a mere Origin Level 4 wasn\u2019t even worthy of mention before it. Also, after having absorbed his and Nora\u2019s bloodline for a month, Ascendwing had successfully incubated its first ability. He was going to entrust his hopes to it.\u3010Ascendwing Short SwordThe remnants arising from the crystallization of the harmonization of the first generation Bloodline Awakener and the Compassion Origin Attribute. Its current user has infused an ability into it.The Unruly: The user is able to teleport to a location within sight three times a day. The maximum distance is determined by the nature of the user\u2019s magic power and attribute.\u3011This ability had appeared yesterday night, but it would prove to be Roel\u2019s greatest weapon by instantaneously closing the distance with that monster cloaked in human skin to destroy him.As powerful as this ability was, it had its limitations. For one, he could only teleport to places within sight, which meant that it was impossible to teleport across walls. Furthermore, visibility would be greatly reduced due to the constant fog and the darkness; that meant that the distance he could teleport was reduced to only 10 meters.This was extremely disadvantageous to Roel.Based on what he had seen during the fight with the patrol squad, Peter Kater\u2019s painting had a striking distance of 20 meters, which meant that just a teleportation distance of 10 meters was insufficient. To make things worse, the mana cost for multiple teleportations was too great for Roel to bear even in his best condition.This was a problem that he had to solve right now, and fortunately, he seemed to have found a solution in the Affection Points Exchange Shop.\u3010Black Crow Fog LightsWarm light pierces through all obstructions. It\u2019s a tool used in Fog Capital Shantu to guide people home. When the fog starts to settle in, its light will turn green. During that time, please remain at home.Price: 500 Affection Points/light\u3011Roel had always thought that his System was not very unreliable, but who could have thought that he would actually be able to find the key to overcoming his quandary through it? The Black Crow Fog Lights was like the final missing piece to his plan.With the fog light in hand, he prepared himself to face a night of untold danger.\u2026Peter Kater noticed that something was off about the situation.He held onto his wounded arm as he stared at the eerie looking monastery shrouded by the fog. Without historical knowledge comparable to Nora, he was unable to discern just what kind of era this building came from. All he felt was that this place was a little creepy.He turned to look at the withered noblewoman leading the way and the hellhound she was holding.\u201cEva, do you sense any other presences here other than those two brats?\u201dThe noblewoman shook her head in response to her master\u2019s question. Peter looked at the yellow light hanging on the roof of the monastery and pondered silently. Even though this \u2018Eva and Her Dog\u2019 painting was not particularly powerful amongst Peter\u2019s many paintings, its tracking ability was second to none.Anyone who had entered the building within the last three days wouldn\u2019t have been able to escape the notice of the hellhound, unless that person was of Origin Level 3 or above.However, was it possible for an Origin Level 3 transcendent to appear at a place like this?Peter shook his head with a chuckle.That was impossible. Even though he wasn\u2019t sure what in the world was happening here, if there was really such a powerful individual on this battlefield, he would have already been killed by now. One must know that Peter hadn\u2019t been concealing his aura all this while. From this, he assumed that there wasn\u2019t any major threat to him here.Peter felt that the likelihood of encountering danger was unlikely, but nevertheless, there was still a need to maintain the highest level of wariness just to be safe. So, he had Eva and her hellhound lead the way at the front while he followed them from a distance away. In a sense, it was this decision that had saved his life.Ruff! Ruff ruff ruff!The moment they passed through the doors of the monastery, the hellhound that Eva was holding onto suddenly began barking uneasily toward the empty dark shadow. The perplexed Peter was just about to ask about it when a silver gleam flashed across the air.A distortion suddenly formed amidst the darkness as a silhouette carrying a sword dashed out, directing his sword toward the hellhound and Eva.Ascendwing\u2019s incredible might was revealed instantly. It pierced right through the hellhound and Eva, causing their bodies to distort before vaporizing into thin air.Seeing this scene through Eva\u2019s eyes, Peter\u2019s face warped in fury. He didn\u2019t expect to lose a precious painting just like that, but before he could erupt in anger, the silhouette had already moved on to his next target\u2014him.\u201cBrat, you\u2019re asking for it!\u201d bellowed Peter.His painting, the Smiling Mother, immediately surfaced from behind him, causing the surroundings to suddenly become viscous. The stench of blood that suddenly suffused the air was nauseating.However, the short sword released its glow once more, liberating Roel from the heavy weight on him. He continued to dash forward as he eyed the man standing before him. He noticed that the latter\u2019s palm was faced toward him, an action reminiscent of a magician preparing to cast a spell.Should I continue charging? Or should I back away?Roel was put in a dilemma at this moment. If he advanced a few more steps, he could use the ability of his short sword to leap to Peter\u2019s side. However, these additional few steps posed a huge risk to him.Roel felt like there was a fire burning in his heart, but his mind was as calm as still water. He recalled Peter\u2019s battle performance against those soldiers earlier on. The latter was indeed powerful as an evil cultist, and his prowess as an Origin Level 4 transcendent was not to be scoffed at.Was it possible to kill him with a direct charge?There was indeed such a possibility, but the chances of it succeeding was very slim. It was so low that Roel wouldn\u2019t want to take his chances.\u201cThe Unruly!\u201dAll of a sudden, Roel felt a premonition of danger strike his heart. He quickly infused his mana into his short sword, and his body vanished from view.A bloody ray of light blasted out from the tip of Peter\u2019s finger, crossing through the space Roel was standing just a moment ago. It struck the walls of the monastery with a heavy impact, causing the building to creak a little.This was a terrifying spell that could instantaneously induce the explosion of one\u2019s blood. It was one of the usual spells that Peter used to decimate his enemy and prepare the paint he needed for his artwork. It should have decided the battle, but it fell empty instead.\u201cWhat happened? Goddamnit! Where is he?\u201dPeter could hardly believe his eyes. It was true that he didn\u2019t expect Roel to be able to avoid his attack, but what really shocked him was the brat suddenly disappearing into thin air!What is happening here?Flustered now, Peter quickly scanned his surroundings and instructed Smiling Mother to coil around him and protect him. He began trying to make sense of the situation by thinking through all the possibilities.Not many spells allowed one to simply vanish into thin air, and the prices one had to pay to cast them were extremely heavy. The Country of Scholars, Brolne, did have a faction that was skilled in concealment, but that wasn\u2019t an ability that Roel, who didn\u2019t possess any Origin Attribute, could have learned. It was limited to only high-level transcendents.\u201cIt\u2019s his weapon. That sword\u2026\u201d muttered Peter as he narrowed his eyes coldly.He recalled how the sword was able to destroy Eva in a single strike, and that made him feel deeply uneasy. However, he knew better than to reveal his fears in battle. He continued scanning the room with a cold look on his face.Meanwhile, on one of the beams near the ceiling of the monastery, hidden from Peter\u2019s sight, Roel was currently eyeing Peter with cold eyes. With a silent sigh, he took off Shadow Lover as he began analyzing his situation again.The surprise attack wasn\u2019t exactly a failure, but it was true that he had missed a valuable opportunity to get Peter while he was off guard.In his initial plan, he was aiming to use Shadow Lover\u2019s concealment ability to camp at a spot to deal a swift and deadly blow to Peter. However, Peter was far more vigilant than he had thought. Not only did he choose to send his painting in first, but he was even wary enough to maintain some distance. That ensured him sufficient time to react to anything unexpected.The current situation wasn\u2019t exactly in Roel\u2019s favor. The Smiling Mother had some sort of AOE delay skill. Whenever he draws near, his movements would almost grind to a halt. He recalled how the soldiers earlier on froze up in her presence before having their throats slit open.Also, Peter\u2019s reflexes could be considered noteworthy. They didn\u2019t make him inhumanly fast, but it was excellent for a magician. He was able to swiftly recover and launch a decisive counterattack despite being caught off guard. The duration he took to cast his offensive spell was also quite fast too, taking just one second.It was due to all of this that Roel was left with no choice but to swiftly teleport away and bide his time, waiting for his next opportunity.The battle also granted Roel some understanding about his sword and its first ability too. Without a doubt, The Unruly was a powerful ability, but it had its own limitations too. The maximum distance that he could possibly teleport was 50 meters at the moment.Being able to teleport 50 meters might sound amazing, but considering the burst power of transcendents, it was still insufficient. There were plenty of spells that had a strike range further than 50 meters.However, one thing that gladdened Roel was that he was mistaken about its mana cost. The mana consumed was 10% of the spellcaster\u2019s total mana, which was still a comfortable amount for Roel to bear. However, it was likely that its effectiveness would become poorer when he was faced with far stronger enemies in the future too, especially with its limited uses.Eyy, how cool would it be if I could teleport all around the battlefield without restraint?Nevertheless, aside from the unfortunate limitations of Ascendwing, even Roel had to admit that it was a broken weapon. He glanced downward to look at Peter, who was still warily scanning the room for him.Currently, he still has two more uses left of his sword\u2019s ability. It would only suffice for one charge and one retreat. It was impossible for him to abandon Nora, who was still lying somewhere inside the monastery, so there was only one thing left for him to do.Kill Peter in the next strike.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 - To Each Their FaithPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 80: To Each Their FaithWade Xeclyde looked out of the window as he waited for the sunlight to bask upon the lands once more.Everyday, dawn and dusk; these were the fixed resting times for the grand labyrinth that had segmented the streets into dozens of individual pieces. For an hour during these two periods, the lingering fog would recede temporarily, allowing one to navigate through the labyrinth without suffering from impaired visibility.However, after the hour was up, the fog would creep back in and a new labyrinth would emerge, rendering all of the information collected over the past half a day useless. This was also the reason why Wade\u2019s allied armies were unable to find Victoria and Ponte no matter how they combed the area.Unless they were able to gather an army of over a hundred thousand to fill up the entire street, their chances of reaching Victoria and Ponte banked entirely on luck. Furthermore, their armies couldn\u2019t afford to advance too quickly due to the poor visibility, which meant that the efficiency of their search was lower than expected.Just last night, however, Wade found a new ray of hope. There was no need for him to search blindly anymore, for he had detected a resonance with the royal bloodline on Locke Street.Without a doubt, the one who was resonating with the royal bloodline had to be Victoria. While Wade couldn\u2019t understand why she would deactivate the magic tool that was suppressing her royal bloodline, there was no doubt that this was a good opportunity for Wade to strike.As soon as the fog dissipated at dawn, he would personally lead his armies toward where the resonance was coming from.\u201cYour Highness, we have no idea what Victoria and Ponte are up to. The fact that they dare to reveal their location means that it\u2019s likely for there to be a trap waiting for us there. Please remain here and allow me to go instead.\u201dLooking at the young man gazing out of the window, Felder Elric placed his fist on his chest and spoke gravely. He felt that it was best for him to move, given the risks involved.However, the young man he was addressing didn\u2019t respond to him. The other party continued looking out of the window quietly, as if not hearing his request.\u201cFelder, what do you think is the cause of my mother\u2019s death?\u201d\u201cHm? It\u2019s due to the political shenanigans of the nobles and priests of the church\u2026\u201dFelder was surprised by the abrupt question posed by Wade. He blinked his eyes in confusion as he revealed his own view on the matter, but the latter shook his head in response to his answer.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. That\u2019s just scraping the surface. The real reason lies in our differences.\u201d\u201cDifferences?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dWade turned around to face Felder, and he began to explain calmly.\u201cGeographical differences, racial differences, nationality differences, faith differences; all of these differences we have with one another induce fears. They are like fences that segregate us from one another. We view everything that stands outside our fence with fright, fearing that others would infringe on our sanctuary and threaten our existence.\u201cRegardless of your identity and merits, as soon as you display any difference from the majority, you\u2019ll be treated differently. It could range from subtle discrimination to genocide. That\u2019s the true cause behind my mother\u2019s death.\u201cHave I avenged her through this war yet? There are probably many who think that I have achieved my goal. The nobles who had sidelined and pressured her back then have already died, but that\u2019s not my end goal. It\u2019s not over yet. The vengeance I seek goes far beyond that!\u201cMy mother died from the plague and the scorn of the nobles, but more than that, she died due to the discrimination and oppression arising from the differences in ideals. That\u2019s what I seek to shatter in my vengeance. I want to tear down those tall fences that people hide themselves behind! But, there\u2019s just far too much that needs to be eliminated\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult journey ahead, but it\u2019s not entirely impossible. For one, I could unify the continent together as one, just like the Ancient Austine Empire back in the Second Epoch\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWade looked at the dumbfounded Felder with eyes burning with ambitions.\u201cYou once asked me what my dream is. I\u2019ll give you an answer right now. This is my dream! It won\u2019t be easy to realize it; there will be difficulties every step of the way. Your strength is irreplaceable to me in fulfilling this goal\u2026 That\u2019s why, I forbid you from viewing yourself as a pawn to me.\u201dWith a faint smile on his lips, Wade refused Felder\u2019s request. However, Felder was in far too much shock to respond right away.Even though Felder had known that the liege he served was one with great ambitions, he never imagined that the latter would actually harbor such grand dreams. He actually wanted to construct a unified empire for all humans.\u2026 If it\u2019s him, with his talents and the power of the Theocracy, that might just be possible!Felder suddenly felt that Wade looked far bigger and more imposing than before. The marquess straightened his back once more before bowing solemnly.\u201cI\u2019m grateful for the high opinions you have for me. I\u2019m willing to devote my life to fulfilling your dreams! However, Your Highness, I can\u2019t allow you to walk into Locke Street by yourself. So what if it\u2019s a trap? If I don\u2019t even have the courage to face this bit of danger, how could I possibly be worthy of standing by your side and fulfilling your dreams?\u201dThose words made the edges of Wade\u2019s lips inch up further. Even though there was no crown on his head, the air he commanded was already comparable to that of a conqueror.\u201cWe\u2019ll set off at daylight.\u201d\u2026\u201cWade will definitely head there, I\u2019m certain of it.\u201dIn the Labyrinth Villa, Victoria Xeclyde pointed to the blinking red dot on Locke Street as she directed a sharp look toward a helpless looking black-haired man sitting not too far away.Ponte Ascart was holding onto one of his diaries with a musing look on his face. It was a long time later before he finally responded.\u201cVictoria, is your magic tool really working normally? Could it be malfunctioning? No matter how I look at it\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s working fine.\u201dVictoria\u2019s sharp and resolute response left Ponte at a loss for words. As a teacher, he felt that it wasn\u2019t appropriate for him to probe too deeply into the private affairs of his pupil, but given the current circumstances, it didn\u2019t seem like he had any other choices.\u201cRegarding this\u2026 Victoria, does your family have any distant relatives that are not known to the rest of the world or something like that\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing of that sort.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s certain that Holy Eminence Ryan isn\u2019t in Loren at the moment, so what do you think this red dot signifies then?\u201d\u201cProbably an illegitimate child.\u201dVictoria puckered her lips as her complexion turned a little awful. The worst thing that could happen in the midst of a disaster was for a family crisis to suddenly break out, especially when it was something as explosive as the revelation of the existence of a half-sibling. Anyone stumbling into such a situation would feel utterly annoyed.As a member of the Xeclyde House, it wouldn\u2019t do for Victoria to speak badly about Holy Eminence Ryan, her father, but it couldn\u2019t be helped, and her mood became awful.\u201cAh. What do you propose we do about this then? Are we going to save that person?\u201dPonte discreetly glanced at his fuming pupil while asking carefully. Victoria took a few breaths to calm herself, before finally nodding her head.\u201cNo matter what, it\u2019s a fact that our Xeclyde House is lacking in offspring. Furthermore, the fact that the child has been roaming around on the streets goes to show that the Holy Eminence isn\u2019t aware of his or her existence. They\u2019re an innocent bystander in this conflict, so I can\u2019t let them to die in Wade\u2019s hands.\u201dAfter saying her piece, Victoria raised her head to look Ponte in the eye.\u201cTeacher, please help me. I wish to bring that child here.\u201dPonte fell into a moment of silence after hearing Victoria\u2019s request, but it wasn\u2019t hesitation on his face but graveness.\u201cVictoria, I understand how you feel, but you should understand the cost of your action. We might come to blows with Wade over this matter. You\u2019ll be putting yourself in great danger.\u201d\u201cI understand, teacher, but I can\u2019t turn a blind eye to my kin\u2026 Furthermore, for Wade\u2019s plan to come to fruition, he has to hold an unshakable leverage over the Xeclyde House. He cannot allow an illegitimate child to meet our father.\u201dVictoria\u2019s eyes drooped sorrowfully as she spoke. She hated how things had come to this point between her and her twin brother, but she knew that she had to stop Wade at all cost.It was not a lack of understanding between them that brought about this conflict. On the contrary, it was precisely because she knew Wade\u2019s plans that made her determined to stop him.Wade\u2019s ambitions were simply too great. It was to the point where the Theocracy wouldn\u2019t be able to bear the weight of his dreams. It would spell a calamity for the world if Wade were to don the crown. Countless civilians would lose their lives, and families would be torn apart.\u201cSince you have already made up your mind, I won\u2019t say anything more about it. Let\u2019s face off with those two brats, Wade and Felder, then.\u201dPonte sighed deeply in his mind before stepping forward to console his student.Following that, he began to analyze a feasible plan for the operation. He took a look at the map of Locke Street and prayed that the environment there was suitable for him to exert his prowess.Meanwhile, Victoria put her sorrow aside and began preparing the manpower required for the operation. There was no doubt that the blinking red dot on Locke Street would spark up a huge battle between both factions after several days of relative peace.Unknowingly, ominous clouds had begun gathering from all around, bringing a heavy feeling to the battlefield.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 - A Life And Death BattlePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 81: A Life And Death BattleInside the monastery, Klaude was clutching tightly to a sword he hadn\u2019t used even once since obtaining it. He huddled up into a ball inside the mini fortress he had built in the room out of furniture and trembled fearfully.Klaude was already middle-aged, which meant that he had a wealth of life experiences, but ultimately, he was more into books than swords. He spent most of his time inside the monastery teaching the students language, math, and the stories about the Genesis Goddess Church.Being conscripted to join Princess Victoria\u2019s logistical platoon was probably the most frightening event in his life. He had to march into the battlefield to carry the wounded back to camp so that they could get treated, so it was inevitable that he would be exposed to the cruelty and gruesomeness of war. In just a few short days, he had already seen more bloodshed than he ever wanted to.He was disappointed when he was left behind by the main army, but in truth, it was also a huge relief to him too. Being able to return to this familiar monastery set his mind at ease, making him feel like everything was normal once more.Little did he expect that he would actually stumble onto Sia\u2019s envoys in this familiar monastery. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, an evil cultist even knocked on the doors of the monastery shortly after. The evil cultist summoned countless vengeful spirits around, haunting the monastery. A malevolent air drifted in the surroundings, and from time to time, cries of agony could be vaguely heard from the fog. He thought that the demons from legend had resurfaced in the world.Klaude stared at the sealed door as he gasped for air. Huge droplets of perspiration could be seen dripping from his head. He turned around to look at the sleeping girl behind him, and a complicated and fearful look surfaced on his face.The Holy Sons must be fighting with all their strength right now.Klaude\u2019s faith was telling him that he ought to do something, but his trembling body rendered him powerless. In his view, the only ones who could deal with those evil demons were the Holy Sons.He was convinced that Nora and Roel weren\u2019t ordinary mortals, not just in terms of strength but character too. They were strong yet humble, polite and approachable, brave and unyielding. They would unhesitatingly pick up their weapons and fight against any evil cultist who came their way. Ordinary mortals didn\u2019t possess the inner strength they did.In truth, Nora and Roel were frightened too. However, they found their courage to overcome their fear in different places. For Nora, it was her lineage and her dignity. For Roel, it was his sense of responsibility and morals. Their reasons were different, but it allowed them to overcome the hurdles in their hearts, granting them the strength to stand strong.Surrendering to a stronger power wasn\u2019t frightening; what was more frightening was the surrender of one\u2019s soul. Klaude could feel a lofty, unshakable spirit coming from the two children, and it was a quality that he had only seen in very few prestigious figures like Princess Victoria.\u201cMay Sia bless the two of you.\u201dKlaude bowed to the idol of Goddess Sia and fervently prayed for the safety of the two Holy Sons.\u2026Peter Kater had never thought that a day would come where he would be forced into a defensive position by a mere Origin Level 6 brat. With \u2018Eva and Her Dog\u2019 destroyed, he was only left with Smiling Mother and a few other minor paintings to use.A fat businessman, a stern soldier, a crying maid\u2026 Peter released all of his earlier, more mediocre works. Most of these paintings didn\u2019t wield too much strength, and Peter considered them an embarrassment. However, given the current situation, his pride was of secondary concern. In this fog where his visibility was limited to 10 meters, he was faced with an opponent who wielded a powerful weapon and could mysteriously vanish into thin air. All of this manifested into a fatal threat that gripped his heart with fear.The pale-faced Peter took deep breaths as he tried his best to calm his heart.I mustn\u2019t panic. It\u2019s just an Origin Level 6 brat, that\u2019s all!So what if he has a powerful weapon in his hands? His combat experience and mental fortitude is nothing compared to me! I am the hunter here. He\u2019s nothing more than my prey!While reassuring himself, he shouted furiously at the surroundings, hoping to lure Roel out. However, other than the cries of vengeful spirits, there was nothing to be seen or heard amidst the fog. His yellowish eyes glared at the surroundings in fury.It was then that he suddenly sensed some movements in the defense line formed by his paintings 20 meters behind him.Found you!As soon as he received the information from his paintings, Peter Kater channeled his mana into the tip of his finger, manifesting a ball of red light. It was the vile spell that made the target\u2019s blood explode upon impact. Without hesitation, he shot out the spell, and it struck a figure cloaked in a red shawl.\u201cHahahaha! Do you finally understand the difference standing between us now, brat? Did you think that you can defeat me just because you have a couple of good items on you? You must be dreaming!\u201dPeter Kater was ecstatic to see that his spell had struck a target. He laughed gleefully as he began striding toward the target he had just struck, wanting to admire the pained look on Roel Ascart\u2019s face as his body was reduced to a pile of bloodied water.To his horror, while it was indeed Roel Ascart lying there, the look on him wasn\u2019t that of pain but of triumph and ridicule. Roel was lying prone on the floor, his hand grasping onto the purple pendant which he wasn\u2019t able to activate back at the \u2018Personal Studio\u2019. There was a shimmering barrier that was made out of light cloaking his body. No matter how the paintings clawed at the barrier, they were unable to breach it.From the instant that Peter Kater saw that Roel was fine, his mouth opened and closed in utter shock, losing his speech. On the other hand, Roel\u2019s eyes lit up with murderous intent.\u201cGotcha!\u201dRoel\u2019s voice was like an invitation from the grim reaper.At the next instant, Roel\u2019s body suddenly vanished into thin air. A gust of wind blew from Peter\u2019s back as a short sword pierced right through Smiling Mother with unstoppable momentum. It all happened so fast that Peter had no time to react at all.Pchi!The sound of a blade piercing into a human\u2019s body sounded loudly in the air.Peter lowered his head in disbelief as he looked at the blade stabbing right into his chest. Blood spewed out of his mouth. It was then that he realized that he had fallen for Roel\u2019s trap.I was fooled by a mere brat.As blood spurted from Peter\u2019s body, his consciousness gradually blurred. His life began to flash before his eyes. He recalled his poorer years, the despaired days he spent after his lover and family members died, as well as the days that he spent wandering around as an unrecognized painter. In the end, he was taken in by an evil cultist and ended up walking on the path of a transcendent.The young painter he saw in his memories had such a resolute look on his face, swearing to never be governed by the rules of the world anymore. That was his initial goal of being a transcendent.However, as time passed, he found himself turning into a tool of the organization. His initial dreams had eroded away before he knew it, and now, he was even going to lose his life to his target.I see. Is that the reason why I can\u2019t advance any higher?As death crept closer and closer to him, an epiphany struck Peter. He suddenly understood just what he was lacking. Along with this realization, his mana began to gush outward furiously. With newfound strength, he grabbed the short sword that was plunged into his chest and turned around to face Roel with reddened eyes.\u201cCough! Brat, I didn\u2019t think that you would have been able to push me to this point. I have really underestimated you. You are indeed a far more formidable opponent than I had thought. However\u2026 did you think that you can kill me just like that?\u201dPeter howled with the fury of a beast. His gaze was filled with the tenacity to tear apart the enemy before him.Roel felt goosebumps rising up all over his body in fear. This was the first time he was really witnessing just how frightening and unyielding the transcendents of this world were.\u201cYou\u2019re underestimating the prowess of an Origin Level 4 transcendent! Did you really think that you\u2019ve stabbed my heart? Take a closer look!\u201dRoel widened his eyes as he looked at the wound caused by Ascendwing, only to see that the injury he caused had vanished without a trace. In its place was a distorted portrait.\u2018\u201cState of Immersion\u2019, this is my greatest trump card. A part of my body has already turned into a painting. You can no longer kill me!\u201cI admit that you were indeed a fearsome adversary, Roel Ascart, but it\u2019s a pity that you are far too weak. You aren\u2019t able to comprehend what transcendents are capable of. That\u2019s why, this battle is my victory!\u201cStill, I should thank you for reminding me of my past. I finally see what is pulling me back. With that, goodbye!\u201dPeter grabbed the short sword in front of his chest tightly while summoning the tattered Smiling Mother back to his side. The bloodied, bony hands of Smiling Mother swiped across the air to tear through Roel\u2019s throat.At this critical moment, time suddenly seemed to have slowed for Roel.Peter was right. Roel was not a true transcendent yet. He didn\u2019t have a real grasp of just what high-level transcendents were truly capable of, leading to his plans falling short. However, that didn\u2019t mean that it was over yet.If Peter was able to suddenly release a huge burst of power when crisis struck, there was no reason why Roel couldn\u2019t do likewise. The enemy before him might be a tenacious demon, but he was no pushover either!He reached out to the flames of life that burned at his very core and ignited it, causing it to blaze with astounding fervor.\u3010System confirmed.\u3011\u3010Spell \u2018Grandar\u2019s Promise\u2019 has been activated.\u3011\u3010Countdown. 30\u2026 29\u2026 28\u2026\u3011Rampaging mana seared every nerve in Roel\u2019s body, inciting him to roar in frenzy. The sudden surge of power caused his muscles to rip and tear, but he couldn\u2019t feel a thing at all. His body had already lost its sense of pain.At the same time, the bony claws of Smiling Mother finally reached Roel\u2019s body and pierced through his chest, inflicting him with a fatal wound. Yet, Roel paid no heed to that either. At this very moment, his attention was focused solely on Ascendwing.\u201cShit! What\u2019s going on? Why did your mana suddenly\u2026 Impossible\u2026 Smiling Mother, hurry up and kill him!\u201dPeter immediately noticed that things had gone awry. The short sword that he had been holding in place was moving once more, threatening to pierce through the area of effect of the State of Immersion. He bellowed to his paintings desperately, but it was all futile.Roel was like an infallible war god. Despite grievous wounds that were being inflicted on his body, his face remained impassive. Even his fighting prowess hadn\u2019t lessened in the slightest.Is this\u2026 undead reanimation? It can\u2019t be!Peter stared at the bloodied boy before him in shock and incomprehension. Perhaps it might have been a figment of his imagination, but he seemed to see a massive silhouette standing right behind the boy, gazing down on him with eyes so impassive they made him feel as if he was nothing more than an ant.He panicked. He knew that things had gone completely wrong, but he was powerless to change anything.\u201cThanks for your warning. Goodbye, Peter Kater.\u201dSurrounded by the ghosts of the paintings and the fog, Roel swung Ascendwing horizontally with unstoppable force.In the wake of a flash of silver light, a body was severed in two.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 - Good, We Got HimPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 82: Good, We Got Him\u201cYou\u2026 How is this possible? Cough!\u201dThe curtains were finally drawn on this life-and-death battle within the fog outside the monastery. A silver flash of light ripped through Peter Kater\u2019s body, and all of the distorted paintings gathered around him were torn apart.Peter Kater had no more means to avert his death. He felt his mana swiftly flowing out of his body, dissipating into the surroundings.\u201cI never thought\u2026 that I would really lose my life here\u2026 Hahaha\u2026 Brat, don\u2019t get too smug\u2026 You dared to make a deal with that kind of existence\u2026 One day, you\u2019ll too\u2026\u201dDespite having only half a body, Peter laughed at Roel in mockery as he thought about the massive silhouette that he saw earlier, but before he could finish his words, he had already succumbed to death. All that was left on his face was a smile of ridicule.Meanwhile, Roel was gasping for breath after his massive exertion. He wasn\u2019t in any state to listen. He could only feel a searing heat burning his body.The invulnerability effect was still active for the moment. As the skill counted down to its end, the wounds inflicted by Smiling Mother and the other paintings began to quickly heal up. A surge of dark energy was swiftly rejuvenating his body, nursing him back to full health.\u30103\u2026 2\u2026 1\u2026\u3011\u3010Spell \u2018Grandar\u2019s Promise\u2019 has ended.\u3011\u2026With the end of the spell, the System\u2019s \u2018Evaluation\u2019 was also quickly being updated, and this was the final result:\u3010Evaluation: High (74)\u3011Roel wasn\u2019t too surprised by the sudden increase in his evaluation.He reached out to touch his abdomen. Previously, Smiling Mother had left a gaping hole there. Now, nothing remained but a smear of blood on his unblemished skin. His wounds had completely healed up, not leaving even a scab behind.Is the recovery ability of undead that great?, Roel wondered.He recalled all of the movies on overpowered zombies he had seen in his previous world, but even they didn\u2019t seem so formidable. Perhaps the undead in this world were exceptionally powerful.\u201cThe effects are incredible, but it\u2019s just\u2026 incredibly exhausting\u2026\u201dRoel\u2019s body wobbled from side to side as he spoke feebly to himself.Transforming from an ordinary human into an undead and back took a huge toll on the body. Even with his injuries healed, he still couldn\u2019t recover from his frail state right away. It felt like his body had been completely emptied out.With unsteady steps, Roel staggered over to a nearby worn-out signpost that indicated \u2018Locke Street 42\u2019 and leaned against it. He took deep breaths to soothe the discomfort he felt, before turning to look at the monastery with a relieved smile.It had been incredibly dangerous, but he managed to overcome the disaster in the end and protect Nora. This was enough for him.\u201cWhat an irony though. Am I going to be the one to fall ill next once she recovers?\u201dRoel clutched the signpost tightly with a helpless smile on his face. He gritted his teeth and began staggering his way toward the monastery.I need to head back and get Klaude to clean up the body, or else it could draw soldiers over\u2026Halfway to his destination, he suddenly found his vision clearing up significantly. He raised his head and realized that it was already dawn. Sunlight scattered all over the street, brightening the surroundings in an instant.Sunrise and sunset, these were the times that the labyrinth would rest and reset the maze. It would last for an hour each time around. Looking at his own shadow cast behind him, Roel heaved a deep sigh of relief. He was glad that the long night was finally over.However, before he could rest easy, he suddenly noticed another shadow appearing beside him.Someone is behind me!Roel immediately tensed up once more. He knew that there was no such thing as \u2018allies\u2019 in this land where danger lurked at every corner. So, he unhesitatingly turned around and aimed his short sword at the figure standing behind him.To his horror, Ascendwing, which had never failed him since he had obtained it, actually failed to injure his target. A metallic reverberation sounded from the blade. Roel stared in disbelief at the dashing, golden-haired man blocking the sword with his long, slender forefinger.Judging from how the golden-haired man\u2019s muscles weren\u2019t tensed up, it was apparent that he wasn\u2019t exerting himself in the least. At the same time, it didn\u2019t seem like he was actively using his transcendent abilities either.Typically speaking, the sharpness of Ascendwing should have been more than enough to slice a person\u2019s finger in two, but that wasn\u2019t the case right now.Roel was shocked by the current situation, but he wasn\u2019t confused. Just by looking at the golden-haired man\u2019s face, which shared some resemblance to that of the girl currently sleeping inside the monastery, he was already able to figure out the person\u2019s identity.Wade Xeclyde.The worst-case situation had happened. Both he and Nora were in a terribly dangerous position.Wade Xeclyde was an extremely powerful individual. One of the techniques that he was skilled in was to focus his strength at a single spot to stop any weapons that were directed toward him. Such a technique was more or less a gimmick, but it was effective in crushing the fighting will of his opponents.However, the situation was a little different this time around. Just as Wade\u2019s finger was about to come in contact with Ascendwing, the short sword seemed to sense something and abruptly retracted its force, allowing Wade to easily stop it.Needless to say, this bizarre situation piqued Wade\u2019s curiosity. He moved his line of sight from Roel\u2019s bloodied body over to the sword, and his pupils suddenly contracted.Saint\u2019s Blade\u2014Twelve Wings!There was no question that it was the Xeclydes, inheritors of the Angel\u2019s Bloodline, who boasted the greatest knowledge of the Twelve Wings. Due to the nature of their bloodline, they couldn\u2019t be hurt by the Twelve Wings. In fact, this feather-like short sword was even used as their childhood play toy.Wade fully understood the significance of Ascendwing being wielded by the hands of an outsider.\u201cWho are you?\u201dWade turned his eyes back onto the owner of the sword. His gaze was far sharper and graver than it was before, but the person he was addressing appeared to be too tense to speak. Then, he turned his gaze sideward to look at the severed halves of a corpse lying on the ground.This mana\u2026 Origin Level 4? This child managed to kill him?A slight crease formed upon Wade\u2019s forehead. If the presence of Ascendwing created an air of mystery around the identity of the boy before him, the presence of the corpse belonging to an Origin Level 4 evil cultist further deepened it.Wade had a clear grasp of Roel\u2019s strength. The latter was at most at Origin Level 6, having yet to obtain his Origin Attribute. Yet, to be able to defeat an evil cultist 2 levels stronger than himself\u2026 This was truly unbelievable, a nigh impossible feat.Could it be the sword\u2019s ability?,Wade wondered.Meanwhile, contrary to what Wade believed, Roel\u2019s mind hadn\u2019t come to a halt just because Ascendwing had failed him. In fact, his mind was churning at full throttle to figure out a way to lure this prince as far away as possible from the monastery.He wasn\u2019t certain why Wade had suddenly appeared here, but he knew for certain that he couldn\u2019t allow the prince to meet Nora. Everything Wade was doing right now, including inciting this grievous civil war, was to make him the sole successor to the throne. That was the condition he had to fulfill in order for his plan to come to fruition.Therefore, there was no way Wade could tolerate the existence of Nora. He would have to lure Wade away from here by hook or by crook, but how was he supposed to do so?The most direct method was for him to lure Wade away by running away from this area. With such thoughts in mind, he turned his gaze to Ascendwing in his hand.So far, he had already used \u2018The Unruly\u2019 twice today, which meant that he had one last teleportation left. However, given that the maximum distance he could teleport was 50 meters, and that the labyrinth\u2019s fog had already receded, there was little doubt that he would get caught straight away.To make things worse, he was already encircled. There were all sorts of soldiers marching here from all directions right now, be it armed warriors, silver-armored commanders, light-armored archers, or logistical soldiers.Wade\u2019s allied armies.There were records of them in history, and it was stated that most of them were evil cultists that looked as if they had come from the depths of hell. However, it turned out to be a blatant lie. These soldiers were clearly very well-trained and disciplined, and they were not evil cultists but heretics.But of course, Roel was in no mood to correct history right now. The emergence of the allied armies crushed the final spark of hope that Roel harbored in his heart. With the maximum teleportation distance of 50 meters to \u2018The Unruly\u2019, no matter where he teleported off to, he would only be leaping into a sea of enemy soldiers.\u201cJudging from your clothes, you must be from a high-standing noble house. Interesting. I haven\u2019t heard of any nobles being conferred with Ascendwing, but yours has already been activated.\u201dWade looked to and fro between Ascendwing and Roel\u2019s stiffened face, and he found himself unable to suppress his curiosity any longer.\u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with Victoria?\u201dWhile Wade was asking his question, Roel noticed a golden-haired knight rushing over to them. The knight stopped before Wade and bowed to him.\u201cYour Highness, we have surrounded the area. Our men are prepared to move as soon as you give the command.\u201d\u201cMove in and find her.\u201d\u201cI understand. What about this\u2026\u201d\u201cYou need not care about him. There\u2019s no need to take his weapon away either. He doesn\u2019t have the strength to fight back anymore. Just find someone to take care of him.\u201dWade looked at Roel, who was trying his best to put on a strong front despite being on the verge of passing out at any moment, and he chuckled to himself. He decided to keep this interesting boy alive for the time being and question him later.On the other hand, however, the golden-haired knight was cautious of Roel. He stared deeply at the latter, seemingly trying to assess if Roel would be a threat to Wade or not.At the same time, Roel began assessing the knight in return. To his astonishment, he saw something that he hadn\u2019t expected to see at all.\u3010Wade\u2019s Aide: Felder Elric (Bryan Elric)\u3011Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - B-but I Haven\u2019t Gotten On the Bus Yet!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 83: B-but I Haven\u2019t Gotten On the Bus Yet!Calamity of Bloodshed.This was a spell that Roel bought from the Gold Coin Shop while it was holding a special discount. Its effect was quite mystical, working only on a probability basis. So far, the only person whom the spell had worked on was Peter Kater. That being said, it did provide him with quite some useful information. For one, he learned that he, for some reason, had become a target for evil cults.However, the spell was being activated for the second time this very instant. Roel saw a light-red name appearing above the golden-haired knight\u2019s head. The fact that the color was light-red showed that the knight carried killing intent, but it wasn\u2019t primarily targeted at him.But what was shocking wasn\u2019t the color of the name but rather the name itself.\u3010Wade\u2019s Aide: Felder Elric (Bryan Elric)\u3011He wasn\u2019t too surprised at the start, but when he noticed the name placed inside the brackets, he couldn\u2019t remain composed any longer. It was almost as if he had been struck by a bolt of lightning.The sudden appearance of the name \u2018Bryan Elric\u2019 left Roel\u2019s mind blanking out. His first reaction was to wonder if that Count Bryan had been mysteriously dragged into this world when the labyrinth activated.However, he quickly denied that possibility. For one, it was impossible for Bryan Elric to be in the vicinity of the Labyrinth Villa, and for the other, he seemed to fit perfectly into this world.This knight\u2019s subordination to Wade Xeclyde and the authority he wielded before the soldiers showed that he was indeed Felder Elric, a man who belonged to this era. However, the Calamity of Bloodshed couldn\u2019t possibly make a mistake, so why would Bryan Elric\u2019s name appear?After thinking hard on this matter, Roel could only think of a single possibility\u2014the Felder Elric of this generation was indeed the future Bryan Elric!It was written in the history books that the patriarch of the Elric House had ended his life after the defeat of Wade\u2019s allied armies in the March Turmoil. It was unlikely for this part of the history to be false as the Xeclydes would have personally verified the authenticity of the news.Felder Elric must have found some way to revive himself, allowing him to continue existing as Bryan Elric in the era of Holy Eminence John more than a century later.The discovery of this alarming secret made Roel\u2019s heart pound harder. He couldn\u2019t help but stare at the golden-haired knight intently, which only seemed to further spur on Felder\u2019s hostility.\u201cBrat, I have no idea where you came from, but you are standing before the great Prince Wade. You better lower your head in humility and respect in his presence.\u201dAfter uttering those threatening words, Felder turned his attention away from Roel and ordered the soldiers to tighten the encirclement around the monastery. Following that, he led the vanguard force made up solely of elite soldiers into the monastery fearlessly.\u201cAhh! Don\u2019t kill me, I am merely a monk\u2026\u201dThe footsteps of the soldiers pattering on the wooden floor of the monastery sounded loudly. The sound of a door being kicked open echoed loudly in the air, and it was swiftly followed by Klaude\u2019s frightened screams.Following that, a soldier rushed out of the monastery and exclaimed excitedly.\u201cYour Highness, we have found her!\u201dA clear smile broke out on Prince Wade\u2019s face upon hearing the report. He quickly made his way into the monastery, and under the lead of the soldiers, he headed straight toward the room Nora laid in.He didn\u2019t even spare a glance at Klaude, who was being pinned against the corner of the room with a blade pressed against his neck, as he walked straight toward the unconscious girl lying on the bed. The tension that had kept him strung up over the last few days finally left his body along with a sigh of relief.I\u2019ve won!The huge losses he had made over the past half a month of internal strife hadn\u2019t been in vain. He managed to succeed in the end. As long as he managed to put Victoria under his custody, his plans would surely work out without a hitch!\u201cStill, I didn\u2019t expect Ponte to abandon you and escape alone. I thought that the two of you\u2026 No, wait a moment. This isn\u2019t right!\u201dWade widened his eyes as he walked closer to take a closer look at the \u2018Victoria\u2019 lying on the bed. He suddenly felt a strong sense of incongruity about the person before him.Even though Victoria had a childlike physique that never seemed to mature, there was no way she could have looked so young. It was almost as if she had regressed several years to return back to her childhood. Furthermore, her bloodline ability\u2026Wade closed his eyes in order to get a keener sense of the bloodline ability of the girl lying before him. The results made his face scrunch tightly out of sheer incredulity. It was true that the girl shared the bloodline origin as him, but her bloodline was only at Bronze-tier!This was obviously not right. Both he and Victoria had already reached Silver Bloodline 6 years ago! Bloodline regression? Just like how it was impossible for a human to age backward, there was no way that the tier of a person\u2019s bloodline could regress either!If so, could it be that Victoria had managed to regress her time? No, that was impossible too. Not even an Origin Level 1 transcendent has the power to tamper with a person\u2019s time, so such a possibility could be excluded.By eliminating all that was impossible, what that was left, no matter how improbable, had to be the truth. Wade had no choice but to accept the true significance behind this baffling situation before him, and that was that the girl before him was not Victoria Xeclyde!\u201cBring that boy outside to me. Now!\u201dHaving stumbled upon the truth, Wade\u2019s very first reaction was to interrogate Roel. However, before his men could move, the textbooks in the monastery that were used to educate the children studying here suddenly released a brilliant flash of light. Countless pages shot out from the textbooks and filled the room.This abrupt situation made Wade\u2019s face darken lividly.\u201cShit!\u201dThe presence of this familiar phenomenon made Wade reflexively draw his sword. But contrary to his expectations, those pages didn\u2019t attack Wade, but instead, they shot forth for the unconscious girl lying on the bed.Amidst the storm of pages, a black-haired man suddenly appeared out of nowhere. He grabbed the unconscious girl before directing a polite smile toward Wade.\u201cA very good morning to you, Your Highness Wade. And\u2026 goodbye.\u201dWith mischievous laughter, Ponte and Nora\u2019s bodies suddenly scattered into countless book pages, causing Wade\u2019s sword to end up piercing through empty air. Wade cast aside his sword furiously and issued an order to his men,\u201cThey must still be in the vicinity. Hurry up and look for them!\u201dWith Wade taking the lead, the soldiers quickly rushed out of the monastery to conduct a thorough search of the area. After their departure, the storm in the room quickly settled down. A page slowly drifted down to the ground, revealing the content on it.\u300c5 March, sunny.Today\u2019s Victoria is wearing yellow panties.\u300d\u2026While book pages were rampaging within the room Nora had been in, there were also some unexpected situations happening outside the monastery too.While Roel was looking around, he suddenly noticed that an army of organized soldiers wearing the standard uniform of the Theocracy\u2019s military had suddenly appeared out of nowhere to encircle all of them. It happened so suddenly that he was left utterly dumbstruck.In Roel\u2019s defense, he wasn\u2019t the only one whose mouth was flopping open and close like a fish out of water. Felder was as shocked as he was.Without a doubt, the appearance of these soldiers was bad news to Wade\u2019s allied armies. This was further reinforced by the fact that these soldiers had, in fact, literally appeared out of nowhere, which meant that the master of this gigantic labyrinth must have pulled some strings here.As for who the master of this massive labyrinth was\u2026 it went without saying that it was Roel\u2019s famed predecessor, Ponte Ascart!Hooray, my savior has come! Long live my ancestors!Roel was more excited about this than anyone else. To his delight, the soldiers of the Theocracy didn\u2019t let him down either. Under the great banner of the Guardian of Radiant Wings, an incredibly beautiful golden-haired woman drew her sword and pointed it toward Felder Elric.\u201cAttack!\u201dA melodious yet firm command was issued to the soldiers of the Theocracy.Princess Victoria\u2019s forces roared furiously as the strongest knights standing at the forefront of the formation led a valiant charge against Wade\u2019s allied armies. At the same time, the archers standing at the back of the formation drew their bowstring to cover them.While Wade\u2019s allied armies were caught off guard, they were not rendered helpless by the situation. They swiftly recovered from the shock and began rearranging their formations to brace themselves for the impact from the knights\u2019 charge.It should have gone without saying that the one who was the most disadvantaged by this clash was Roel.\u201cOi oi oi, I am still here!\u201dStaring at the massive cluster of arrows raining down from above, Roel\u2019s face darkened in horror. The emergence of Victoria\u2019s forces had indeed brought him a ray of hope, but ironically, it also plunged him further into danger. Before he could escape from the grasp of Wade\u2019s soldiers, he had to first and foremost find a way to survive!It didn\u2019t take Roel too much effort to figure out why Wade and Victoria would appear at the same place simultaneously. Given that this monastery was not some strategic location, the only possibility was Nora.It\u2019s likely that they have some sort of magic tool or spell that allows them to detect the royal bloodline, Roel thought.At the same time, he heaved a sigh of relief too. Since Victoria was here, it could only mean that she was also determined to secure Nora, which meant that things wouldn\u2019t work out as Wade intended. The combined prowess of Victoria and Ponte would be more effective than any plan he could think of to help Nora.Actually, now that he thought about it, it was unlikely for Wade to kill Nora outright. The Xeclydes suffered from a lack of offspring, so it was likely that he would avoid killing any of his family members unless the situation truly warranted such a course of action. While Nora was an unexpected variable, Wade would probably wait for her to wake up and explain the circumstances first before deciding whether to take her life or not.In the end, the one who was in the greatest danger here was in fact none other than Roel himself.He was already on the verge of getting killed by friendly fire over here. This was his firsthand experience of what a large-scale battle among transcendents was like. Perhaps it was out of consideration that they were in the midst of a city or that it was simply too mana consuming, neither sides were using any elemental attribute spells; there were no fireballs or the like flying around.But despite the lack of special effects, the threat he faced was way more deadly than a volley of fireballs.A single arrow struck the empty ground just five meters away from Roel, and the mana infused on its tip immediately exploded. The rock-paved street shattered from the blow, and a powerful shockwave stirred up by the explosion nearly pushed Roel down to the ground.\u201cHoly shit\u2026 This isn\u2019t what arrows are supposed to be like!! It\u2019s no wonder they aren\u2019t bothering to use fireballs or that sort of fantasy stuff. Hell, these arrows are faster and more destructive than any fireball can possibly be!\u201dRoel immediately clutched the purple pendant hung around his neck, summoning a thin layer of shielding to surround him. Fortunately, the quality of Carter\u2019s magic tools was reliable, or else this rain of arrows would have been more than enough to take his life.Under the fierce assault of Princess Victoria\u2019s forces, Wade\u2019s allied armies suffered heavy losses. Cries of agony sounded ceaselessly in the air.Roel shot a look at the five soldiers who were assigned to guard over him. Two of them had already lost their lives, and the other three were either trying to save their comrades or had drawn their shields and weapons, preparing themselves for battle. It was clear that no one\u2019s attention was on him right now. After all, who would care about a mere prisoner when their lives were at stake?Due to the sudden outbreak of chaos, Roel was finally free to make his getaway. He prepared himself to be received by his allies, but in the next moment, he saw a black-haired man flying across the air with a golden-haired girl in his hand.At this moment, Roel only had a single thought in his mind.Wait for me, I haven\u2019t gotten on the bus yet!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 - Are You My Guardian Angel?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 84: Are You My Guardian Angel?When the black-haired man passed by him, Roel suddenly experienced a familiar sensation of dread similar to when he missed the school bus in his previous life. While he didn\u2019t recognize the black-haired man dressed in old-fashioned noble clothes, it wasn\u2019t hard for him to guess who it was based on the fact that he was holding Nora in his hands.Most likely, that person was none other than his perverted predecessor, Ponte. Ponte was supposed to be his ray of hope out of this quandary, but it seemed like the bus didn\u2019t have any empty seats left for him anymore.\u201cNora!\u201dRoel shouted out loudly, hoping to catch her attention if she was awake. He didn\u2019t want to be left behind here.However, as he looked at the two of them flying openly across the sky, he couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous in their stead. No matter how powerful Ponte was, it still didn\u2019t change the fact that they were in the midst of a battlefield right now. Flying right over enemy lines was a sure way to provoke every single enemy archer.Sure enough, this was best exemplified by some of the soldiers standing near Roel at this very moment.\u201cWho is that?\u201d\u201cAn enemy! Shoot him down! Shoot him down!\u201dThe soldiers were infuriated at being looked down on by their foe, who was blatantly escaping under their watch. In just a short second, over a hundred arrows whizzed upwards, targeting the fleeing man in the sky.\u201cThis isn\u2019t good. Nora!\u201dRoel cried out loudly in astonishment. His mind completely went blank in this situation. Having just experienced the incredibly destructive power of arrows in this world, he didn\u2019t dare to imagine what would happen to Nora if any of the arrows landed on target.However, instead of seeing the two flying individuals exploding in a burst of blood, an unbelievable sight happened instead.\u201cHextongue: Distortion.\u201dJust as the arrows were about to strike down their target, the black-haired man suddenly began reciting something. Just like a veteran taxi driver meeting a traffic cop, the arrows that were aimed at him suddenly did a u-turn and flew backward.This physics-defying phenomenon left the mouths of Roel and many other soldiers agape.\u201cThat\u2019s the patriarch of the Ascart House, Ponte Ascart! Continue shooting! Don\u2019t stop! Anyone who gets him will be promoted!\u201d bellowed Wade furiously.Felder immediately drew his sword and slashed it in a crescent arc, releasing a concentrated burst of mana toward Ponte that launched with a terrifying sonic boom. Just in terms of pulsation of mana, it was already far greater than what the Origin Level 4 Peter was capable of. Roel felt that Peter would have surely lost his life if he were faced with such an attack.Naturally, this tremendous burst of mana immediately caught the attention of the whole battlefield. But to everyone\u2019s surprise, Ponte Ascart stood calmly in the face of Felder\u2019s offense, barely reacting at all.\u201cHextongue: Internal Dissolution.\u201dFelder\u2019s burst of mana was just about to strike Ponte\u2019s body when it suddenly exploded from the inside-out. Just like that, an attack so powerful that it could even tear apart steel dissipated into the surroundings. Not only did it fail to injure Ponte, but the shockwave of the explosion even provided him with greater momentum for his escape.\u201cThank you for sending me off, Marquess Felder!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThose words made Felder so furious that he would hurl vulgarities if not for his dignity as a noble.With this, Ponte had traversed across half of the battlefield, and he began to descend toward Princess Victoria\u2019s side. At the same time, the knights below quickly rushed forward with large shields to protect him.\u201cThe commander is coming down!\u201d\u201cShieldbearers in position!\u201d\u201cReturn fire!\u201dPonte\u2019s troops quickly formed a circle around him. At the same time, Princess Victoria gave off the order to fire, causing yet another rain of arrows to rise into the air.Seeing how Ponte managed to flit across a battlefield with ease, Roel couldn\u2019t help but look forward to his future development as a transcendent too. While he knew that the predecessors of the Ascart House were known for their exceptional ability, he was still surprised by how powerful Ponte was.When can I become that strong?Roel looked into the sky longingly. This event had really ignited a fire in his heart. In the past, he had hardly any understanding of what transcendents were capable of, so he was unable to fully visualize the possibilities. However, now that he was witnessing it in person, his motivation to become stronger was greater than ever.But putting dreams aside, Roel suddenly realized that there was an extremely pressing problem at hand.Wait a moment. Nora has been saved, and Ponte has already returned to Princess Victoria\u2019s side\u2026 What about me?!?!Roel took another good look at his surroundings, and he realized that the rain of arrows, which had just stopped for Ponte a moment ago, had started once more. It was apparent that Princess Victoria\u2019s forces were oblivious to his existence.The soldiers beside him lifted their shields up to protect themselves, leaving Roel the only one without cover. He stared at this situation with a dumbstruck expression before cursing furiously.\u201cHell no! You bunch of selfish pricks! In the end, I can only count on myself!\u201dRoel ran toward the side of the street and grabbed the shield of a fallen soldier before leaping into the drain.Holy Capital Loren often had flash rains, and there were frequent cases of summer floods over the past few centuries. So, when Holy Eminence Ryan came to power, he ordered for reconstructions in the city. After a great deal of work, this problem was finally solved once and for all. Due to this, the drains in Loren were wide and deep. It was a tight fit for an adult, but a child could still maneuver in with ease.It was no exaggeration to say that Holy Eminence Ryan\u2019s reconstructions saved Roel\u2019s life. As powerful as the barrier formed by Roel\u2019s purple pendant was, it was immobile. In other words, he could only stand still until the battle was over if he wanted to rely on it. By then, he would simply fall into Wade\u2019s clutches once more.Wade was bound to be furious after having Nora taken away right before his eyes. He would surely do everything he could to investigate Roel, and once he found out that Roel possessed the bloodline of the Ascarts, it would be all over!Knowing that he had to make a stand right now, Roel summoned every last bit of mana and stamina he had left as he held the shield above him and dashed down the drain. He was so desperate that he was running faster than the world-breaking record for 100 meter sprint in his previous life!Tok tok tok!\u201cAh!\u201dThe exploding arrows sent rock fragments and all sorts of miscellaneous objects pattering against the shield. Screams of those wounded reverberated through the battlefield. The chaos and cacophony above made Roel\u2019s forehead furrow, but he didn\u2019t dare to peek or stop.It was fortunate that Victoria\u2019s soldiers were decent with their archery, not one of their arrows landed in the drain. Their professionalism greatly increased Roel\u2019s chances of survival. Otherwise, even with a shield above him, there was no way he could cope with those grenade-like explosive arrows.\u201cHold the enemy down! Protect our retreating allies!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get tangled up with the enemy!\u201dThe commanders barked out orders from above. After securing Nora, Victoria and her forces weren\u2019t intending to continue the battle with Wade. Those at the back tried to retreat whereas those at the forefront tried to cover them. On the other hand, Wade\u2019s allied armies were biting onto them tightly, determined not to allow them to retreat easily.\u201cCharge! Don\u2019t let them get away!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t back down! We can get them!\u201dOrders boomed loudly on the battlefield above, leaving Roel tense and anxious. He knew that he had to get to where Victoria and Ponte were before they got away, or else there was no way he would be able to find them in the labyrinth.With such thoughts in mind, he hastened his footsteps and dashed forward. The blood of the deceased flowed down the streets and into the drain, causing the base to become a little viscous and slippery. However, Roel couldn\u2019t care less about getting a little more dirty now. He bore with the blood stench as he scrambled his way forward.Unfortunately, the situation wasn\u2019t in Roel\u2019s favor. This entire street was under Ponte\u2019s control, so Wade\u2019s allied armies were destined to be unable to hold them down for long.Fog had begun settling into the streets once more. Due to poor visibility, both sides had stopped firing arrows out of fear of friendly fire. The war cries gradually grew softer, signalling that the battle was coming to an end soon.This should have been good news, but it was a nightmare to Roel. He had barely reached the midpoint of both forces, which meant that there was a good chance that he was going to be left behind.What do I do? Should I head upward and sprint forward?There was a good chance that Roel could make it if he were to do so, but the issue was that he didn\u2019t have the armor of either factions, which would make him incredibly conspicuous on the battlefield. If the soldiers of both sides were to clamp down on him together, he would be courting his own death.Roel continued running ahead along the drain as he tried his best to keep his composure. It was at times like this that he couldn\u2019t lose his nerves, or else a reckless action on the battlefield could very well spell his death. But at the same time, he knew that he was at a critical juncture and had to make a decision very soon.He touched the silver sword he was carrying with him contemplatively. He still had one use of The Unruly. The fog had yet to fully settle in yet, which meant that he could still barely make a full distance teleport right now. If he used it well, it would definitely increase his chances of catching up with Victoria\u2019s retreating forces. However, he also understood that just a leap of 50 meters wouldn\u2019t be enough for him to get out of the \u2018battle zone\u2019, which meant that he was still exposing himself to great risk.To leap or not to leap, that is the question\u2026Immense stress had caused Roel\u2019s breathing to grow harsher as he felt a little suffocated. He took a peek out of the drain before finally gritting his teeth in resolution.Damn it! The fog will have completely settled in if I continue hesitating! I should just make a gamble! At the worst, I\u2019ll just activate my purple pendant and hole myself up in the middle of the battlefield like a statue!Having made up his mind, Roel pulled out his silver sword and prepared to leap out of the drain. However, before he could make a move, he heard a series of cheers coming from above.\u201cIt\u2019s His Highness! His Highness is here!\u201d\u201cLong live His Highness Wade!\u201dFrom the exclamation of a single soldier, it took only 10 seconds for it to turn into deafening roars of excitement that shook the earth. Without having to glance over, Roel could already figure out what was going on.Prince Wade had personally stepped onto the battlefield.Following that, a deafening explosion trembled the ground violently. Roel nearly slipped on the slippery blood beneath his feet. Astonished, he quickly peeked out of the drain once more, only to see crimson lightning crackling in the sky, tearing through the fog of the labyrinth.Felder also quickly made use of this situation to raise his sword up high and roar furiously. In an instant, the morale of the Wade\u2019s allied armies grew to a new high, and they charged forth with greater tenacity than before to stop the retreat of their enemies.Roel was a little shocked by how the circumstances of the battlefield changed so quickly. Looking at Wade, who was still channeling his spell at the frontline of the battlefield, he suddenly felt that the other party didn\u2019t look so hateful anymore.I didn\u2019t think you, of all people, would actually sacrifice yourself to buy time for me. You must be my guardian angel!Feeling touched, Roel quickly tucked away his silver sword and continued charging down the drain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - Please, Save HimPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 85: Please, Save Him\u201cVictoria, I have brought her here!\u201dIn the midst of the battlefield, Ponte Ascart descended from the sky together with a young girl in his arms, landing into a shield formation formed by his trusted soldiers. Victoria quickly passed command rights over to her vice commander before rushing over to Ponte\u2019s side.Victoria looked very different from how she seemed back at the Labyrinth Villa. The usual lofty look on her face was nowhere to be seen; on the contrary, she looked deeply worried. As a member of the royal family, she lived her life with a mask. She would usually play the role of a graceful and obedient woman, but at this time, she was revealing her true emotions.As easy as it might have seemed for Ponte to strut into the middle of the enemy camp alone, it was, in reality, a mission fraught with danger. Both Prince Wade and Marquess Felder possessed powers that rivaled Ponte. Nevertheless, using his advantages as a magician of the Hextongue Faction, he still managed to shake them off with ease. His valiant exploits had not just made Roel\u2019s heart pump in excitement, but it had also further captured a certain woman\u2019s heart and boosted the morale of his allies.\u201cWelcome back, teacher. What\u2019s wrong with this child?\u201dVictoria heaved a sigh of relief on the inside after seeing Ponte landing safely on the ground before turning her sights toward the young girl he was holding under his arm. When she saw that the possessor of the royal bloodline was actually a female, she snatched the young girl over from Ponte\u2019s hands without any hesitation.While Ponte was an upright man, as the saying went, there was no human without some sort of peculiar fetish. Due to the cost of his spells, his preferences in women were fully exposed to Victoria, and this was also Victoria\u2019s greatest trump card in keeping Ponte in check.Yes, she knew that Ponte liked flat-chested, petite women. So far, from her observations, it didn\u2019t seem like Ponte was actually into children, but still, better safe than sorry, right?On the other hand, Ponte was also rendered speechless by how sensitive Victoria was about this matter. He had intentionally held Nora around her waist in order to avoid any weird misunderstandings, but who could have thought that it was all futile?\u201cI\u2026 I really am not\u2026 Ey, forget it!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSeeing the soldiers that were surrounding them at the moment, Ponte couldn\u2019t bring himself to say those words out loud. He knew that it was probably going to be useless anyway, as evidenced by the many times before he had tried to clarify the misunderstanding.Meanwhile, Victoria was taking a closer look at her newly discovered blood kin, and her body froze up as soon as she saw the girl\u2019s face. The girl had beautiful facial features reminiscent of a saintly angel, golden hair that shone like sunlight, and a graceful figure. It was an appearance that even Victoria herself was awed by.However, that wasn\u2019t the reason why her body froze up. The reason why she was so shocked was because they were simply too similar\u2026How could this girl look so much like her? Be it appearance or disposition, the girl looked exactly like the Victoria of 10 years ago. If not for the girl\u2019s much younger appearance, she would have thought that their mother had triplets instead of twins back then!What\u2019s going on? How could an illegitimate child look so much like me?Ponte was also taken aback once he had a good look at the girl\u2019s face. He was too focused on dealing with the enemies earlier that he didn\u2019t have any time to pay attention to her. But now that he was taking a closer look, he couldn\u2019t help but be confused.They look so alike even though they don\u2019t have the same mother? Are the genes of the royal family that powerful?\u201cHold on. Why is she unconscious?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not too sure either. She was already like this when I rescued her. Could it be that Wade did something to her?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not right. This child has a high fever\u2026 It\u2019s her bloodline! Her bloodline is awakening!\u201dAs someone who had been through a bloodline awakening herself, Victoria was able to immediately identify the reason for Nora\u2019s abnormal condition, and it astonished her.One must know that the successors of this generation, Victoria and Wade, had been known as prodigies ever since a young age. Their talents as transcendents were amongst the top even when considering the long history of the Xeclyde House, but they only managed to awaken their bloodline to Silver-tier when they were 13.On the other hand, how old was this girl?10? 12?Victoria was not sure, but it was certain that the talents of this lost-long blood kin were at an unbelievable level. As long as she was carefully nurtured, she would definitely become an incredible figure who wielded the power to impact mankind as a whole in the future.I must protect her and keep her from falling into Wade\u2019s hands!, Victoria thought resolutely.She began using her Compassion Origin Attribute to gently direct the flow of energy in Nora\u2019s body, allowing her powers to flow smoothly.Meanwhile, Ponte also felt relieved to see that Victoria was in control of the situation. He turned his attention away from these nearly identical sisters to assess the battlefield. At the same time, he also took out a colorful gemstone. It was the magic tool he used to control the labyrinth, as well as the family heirloom of the Ascart House. While the colorful gemstone had some defects, the power it held was unimaginable.Even though Victoria\u2019s forces seemed to have the upper hand at the moment, it was mostly due to them launching a surprise attack and catching the enemy off guard. Once Wade\u2019s allied armies managed to recover and get their momentum back, they wouldn\u2019t stand a chance at all.There was simply too great a disparity in their absolute military might. The Elric House had really gone all out to support Wade, and the heretics who had been living in the Holy Capital all along had thrown themselves in together with Wade too. These two powers formed an unprecedentedly powerful force that was nigh impossible to stop.On the other hand, the only ones supporting Victoria were the military units stationed in the Holy Capital. Of course, Ponte had also rallied his own personal army back at the Ascart Fiefdom to reinforce them, but Wade\u2019s allied armies had already taken control over the city walls and gates, which meant that the bulk of the Ascart House\u2019s military force wasn\u2019t able to get in.Since Victoria\u2019s forces were unable to win in a direct battle, Ponte wisely proposed for them to avoid a direct confrontation with Wade and save up their strength. They would await the return of Holy Eminence Ryan before staging a comeback.With this in mind, as soon as Ponte escaped from Wade and Felder\u2019s clutches, he activated the colorful gemstone to summon the mist back in.However, his intentions were accurately grasped by the enemy too. Ponte looked at the golden-haired man, who was summoning crimson streaks of lightning to dissipate the mist, and he couldn\u2019t help but be amazed by how fast Wade had matured.Ponte had once served as Wade\u2019s teacher, albeit for a short period of time. He could tell that Wade did have the disposition of a ruler, and his outstanding talents would bring the Theocracy to greater heights. Yet, certain events that happened along the way changed Wade\u2019s ideals, leading him to walk on a different path from Victoria. Those eyes that were once clear were now filled with burning flames.Wade had chosen to walk the path of a revolutionary, and he was determined to achieve his goal no matter how much blood he had to shed along the way. The old flag of the Saint Mesit Theocracy was going to be incinerated in his hands, and no one knew what would be born from the ashes.Just like Victoria, Ponte was also deeply convinced that Wade had to be stopped.\u201cCommander, our brothers at the frontlines are getting stalled by the enemy forces!\u201dThe howl from one of the military officers interrupted Ponte\u2019s wandering thoughts. He swiftly calmed down and focused once more, returning to his usual solemn self. He quickly surveyed the situation, then he began channeling mana in his hands once more.But before he could release his spell, he suddenly heard a scream right next to him.It was a cry from the girl in Victoria\u2019s hands.Nora\u2019s consciousness was extremely faint at the moment, but she could faintly sense that her condition was swiftly improving. Putting everything aside, the Angel\u2019s Bloodline was renowned for its exclusivity. Other than the elders of the Xeclyde House, who shared the same bloodline, there was no one else in the world who could guide her powers and facilitate a successful breakthrough.Of course, it was not entirely impossible for a Xeclyde to awaken on their own, but it would be an extremely risky move. Furthermore, if the awakening process failed even once, it was likely that it would leave behind some irrecoverable internal trauma that would plague them for life.Given Nora\u2019s young age, it was already incredible that she could keep herself together despite the energy rampaging within her body. However, if she were to be left in that state for any longer, there was a good chance that her condition would deteriorate. Due to that, Victoria was currently doing everything she could to preserve this talent for the Xeclyde House.\u201cWhere\u2026 am I\u2026\u201dUnder Victoria\u2019s help, Nora finally regained consciousness. Her eyes fluttered open, but to her surprise, it was to the background of a slightly misty blue sky. There was a face hovering over her that was almost identical to her own except for a few differences. It felt bizarre, almost as if she was looking into a mirror.\u201cY-you are\u2026\u201d\u201cChild, there\u2019s no need to worry. You\u2019re in safe hands. I am Victoria Xeclyde, the second in the line of succession to the Theocracy\u2019s throne. You must have heard of me. Can you tell me your name?\u201dVictoria looked at the shocked girl staring at her and asked with a gentle and composed smile. Illegitimate children were usually forced to hide in the shadows, never to be recognized by their family, so they tended to carry some enmity toward those in the main lineage. For this reason, she thought that the girl would view her in hostility, but the reality was different from what she expected.The girl was taken aback for a moment before she suddenly rose up and grabbed Victoria\u2019s hand excitedly.1 reply\u00a0\u2013 5 hours ago\u201cYour Highness Victoria! I am Nora Xeclyde. I know that it might be hard for you to accept, but I\u2019m actually your distant relative.\u201dAs Nora spoke, a shocked expression that was at odds with the words she was speaking appeared on her face. It was not that she was suffering from a split personality, but that the words spoken came out differently than what she had intended.She was thinking of introducing herself as Victoria\u2019s descendant, but those words seemed to naturally change into something else upon leaving the tip of her tongue. It was almost as if she was put under some sort of restriction spell, preventing her from revealing the truth of her origin to those living in this era.This situation surprised her, but it was not completely unacceptable to her. She had heard of places in myths that imposed a speech limitation on adventurers, and the situation she was in seemed quite similar to that.Actually, her attention wasn\u2019t really on this matter either. In fact, it wasn\u2019t on any matter but a person, or rather, the lack of one. After introducing herself, she began looking around the chaotic battlefield, seemingly searching for something. Unfortunately, no matter where she looked, it was to no avail.\u201cYour Highness Victoria, help me look for someone, please! I\u2019m begging you!\u201dNora grabbed Victoria\u2019s hands tightly as she pleaded with her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even if you ask me to look for someone\u2026 Wait a moment, did you mention Ascart?\u201dVictoria was put in a spot by Nora\u2019s question when she suddenly noticed a key phrase in what the latter had just mentioned. Her eyes immediately darted toward Ponte. The latter was in the midst of gathering his mana to cast another spell, but he, too, caught the girl\u2019s words and quickly turned his head over.\u201cTeacher, is there such a person in your family?\u201d\u201cNo, I have never heard of this person before.\u201dDespite saying so, Ponte continued staring at Nora as he digested what she had just said. He felt like there was something important he needed to recall, but it just wasn\u2019t coming to him for some reason.On the other hand, after hearing how Victoria addressed Ponte, Nora immediately realized who he was. She quickly turned to him and said.\u201cYou must be Marquess Ponte, right? You have to find a way to save Roel. He\u2019s an offspring of the Ascart House! I believe that he might have been captured by the enemy soldiers!\u201dNora\u2019s desperate plea shook Ponte\u2019s will. His flow of mana into the colored gemstone in his hand came to a halt and he began to hesitate between two different decisions. Even though it was a child whose existence he didn\u2019t know of, the knowledge that the other party possessed the bloodline of the Ascart House pricked deep into Ponte\u2019s heart.What could he do? The Ascart House was simply not blessed with fertility!The Ascart House had been quite prosperous over the last few generations, and it would have been all good if not for a single problem persisting in their family tree. For some reason, the patriarch of every single generation had almost always been a single child. Only in a few, rare generations did the patriarch have siblings.Due to this, the Ascart House viewed every single family member with great importance, leading to a very different climate from the usual noble houses that had lots of successors but a great deal of dirty rivalry too.\u201cChild, are you certain that your companion is one of my family members?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m certain. I can swear on my bloodline that it\u2019s the truth. Please, you have to find a way to save him!\u201d Nora said as she bowed deeply to him.The current circumstances left her with no choice but to set aside her pride. She simply couldn\u2019t bear the notion of any danger coming to Roel. The two of them had already been through so much in this labyrinth. Things shouldn\u2019t end like that. They mustn\u2019t!\u201cVictoria, leave this matter to me. I\u2019ll try to look around a bit.\u201d\u201cBut we\u2019re in the midst of a battlefield! To find someone here is\u2026\u201d\u201cOur Ascart House has too few offspring. Even if he\u2019s from the side family, I can\u2019t just give up on him without doing anything at all. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll fully activate the labyrinth before Wade manages to fully bite onto us!\u201dLeaving those words behind as a guarantee, the black-haired man dove into the crowd of battling soldiers and began looking around.\u2026Meanwhile, at the midpoint of the battlefield, Roel was forging a path forward.\u201cGet out of my way! Rahhhh\u4e00!\u201dInside the drain, Roel pulled off an elegant upward kick that accurately struck the \u2018third leg\u2019 of a soldier of the Elric House. He managed to maximize the damage with a minimal amount of exertion. Unfortunately for the soldier though, while he was rolling around the drain with his hand grabbing his crotch, one of Victoria\u2019s soldiers rushed up to him and ended his life.After dealing with an enemy, Roel took a few sharp inhalations to catch his breath. It was not that he was so free as to be able to casually deal with other soldiers along the way, but as the battle got more and more intense, a major crisis occurred for him\u2014the drain was no longer his exclusive domain anymore.Roel\u2019s initial intention was to run along the inside of the drain until he arrived at where Victoria and Ponte were, but life is pretty darned good at finding ways to sabotage plans. As both factions clashed with one another above, a diverse group of people ended up joining him in the drain\u2014alive, dead, half-dead, you name it.Take the soldier Roel had defeated just a moment ago for example, he had rolled into the drain with another soldier from Victoria\u2019s faction and emerged triumphantly from the scuffle. It was just a pity that victory was nothing more than a transient concept. Shortly after, he was defeated under Roel\u2019s sure-kill secret technique, Cracking the Nuts.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Why are there children on the battlefield?\u201d\u201cHe helped me earlier on! I think he\u2019s on our side!\u201dRoel\u2019s presence in this underground world was incredibly conspicuous amongst the other soldiers, but fortunately, the soldier who had worked together with him earlier to defeat the soldier from the Elric House vouched for him. Sensing an opportunity here, Roel quickly leaped out of the drain and made a grand declaration.\u201cBrothers, please escort me to Her Highness Victoria\u2019s side!\u201dAs Roel said those words, he drew Ascendwing and raised it into the sky. The beautiful shimmering blade of the holy sword swiftly caught everyone\u2019s attention.\u201cThis is the token Her Highness has left with me. It\u2019s a weapon of the Twelve Wings series, a treasure tightly guarded by the Xeclydes! I need your help to escort me over to Her Highness\u2019 side!\u201dFearful that the soldiers had spells that could ascertain the authenticity of his words, Roel paid careful heed to his wording, so as to ensure that he was being truthful. Ascendwing was indeed left to him by \u2018Her Highness\u2019, just that it was \u2018Her Highness Nora\u2019 instead of \u2018Her Highness Victoria\u2019. It was not his fault if the soldiers misinterpreted the meaning of his words.The soldiers heard his plea and took a good look at the holy sword. While they couldn\u2019t determine Roel\u2019s trustworthiness, they dared not hesitate for too long. Their goal was to retreat anyway, and it was not a huge deal bringing a child with them.\u201cNew orders! Send the signal to our allies, retreat!\u201dThe military officer in command of this squadron barked out an order, and the squadron immediately began retreating toward Victoria\u2019s position. This abrupt deployment caught the attention of a certain keen-eyed, golden-haired man.\u201cThat bizarre child\u2026\u201dWade, who was in the midst of channeling his spell to keep the labyrinth\u2019s fog at bay as long as possible, was able to easily spot and identify the incongruous Roel in the midst of the battlefield. He thought about all of the doubts in his mind after meeting Nora, and a sharp glint flickered in his eyes.His instincts told him that he shouldn\u2019t let that boy get away so easily.\u201cThere\u2019s something queer about that boy we met previously. Capture him!\u201dIn response to Wade\u2019s order, Felder swiftly scanned the battlefield before locking his eyes on the target.Roel immediately felt something prickling at his back, and a shiver ran down his spine. He instinctively turned around to take a look, only to see a terrifying-looking Felder shrouded in blood mist heading his way.\u2018Billowing Bloodmist\u2019.This was a spell that channeled the mana infused within one\u2019s blood outward to shroud one\u2019s body in a blood mist. It was used for both defending against attacks and enhancing one\u2019s spells. The strength of the spell depended on each individual\u2019s specific constitution. Some could use it to deflect an arrow, whereas others could only barely slow one down.When it came to Felder though, Billowing Bloodmist turned him into a war god on the battlefield. Rather than calling it a blood mist, it looked more like a crimson monstrosity wrapping itself around him. The sheer amount of mana concentrated around him greatly enhanced all of his attributes.Roel was just about to witness firsthand how powerful the enhanced Felder was.Felder started off with a powerful leap forward that produced a sound reminiscent of an exploding cannonball. His crimson silhouette arced across the sky before beginning to descend upon the hordes of soldiers like an unstoppable meteor.Roel was utterly dumbstruck to see this situation, and the soldiers immediately realized that a crisis was going to befall them too.\u201cShit! It\u2019s the Elric Marquess!\u201d\u201cDefend!\u201dThe soldiers quickly raised their heavy tower shields to block Felder, but they were barely any help against a transcendent of Felder\u2019s level. After landing on the ground, Felder charged forward a couple of times before finally arriving right before Roel and the soldiers who were escorting him. He swung his sword horizontally, releasing a crimson wave into the surroundings.Kacha!With a single strike, the tower shields broke apart, and over a dozen soldiers were knocked into the air. Roel was also struck by the shockwave of the collision and ended up rolling uncontrollably backward like a feather amidst a powerful gale.However, it was not like Roel completely blanked out after witnessing Felder\u2019s despair-inducing strength. Instead, he was quickly thinking about the cards he could potentially use to deal with Felder. So far, he had three trump cards in hand.Of those three trump cards, the purple pendant rendered him immobile and Ascendwing could only teleport 50 meters away, a distance that Felder could cover in the blink of an eye.Since it was impossible for him to shake away Felder, there was only one thing that he could do\u2014pit his life against Felder. If he surrendered now, he would be entrusting his fate into the hands of another man, completely losing control over his situation. However, if things worked out, he might just be able to buy enough time for his escape.The importance of planning was often only highlighted in emergency situations. In just a few short seconds, Roel was able to quickly make up his mind and react accordingly.\u3010Spell \u2018Grandar\u2019s Promise\u2019 has been activated.\u3011 \u3010Countdown. 30\u2026 29\u2026 28\u2026\u3011A familiar ticking sound echoed in Roel\u2019s ears once more.At the moment of activation, he seemed to see a desolate plain basked in the afterglow of a setting sun. The eyes of the massive skeleton, Grandar, were gazing down on him, silently urging him to offer the answer to the question he had asked.This hallucination lasted for a mere split second before Roel quickly rose up. His mana began surging forth like a torrential flood. He raised his sword and fearlessly struck down on Felder, who was rushing his way.Boom!There was a loud explosion and shockwave, but this time, it was coming not from Felder but Roel. It looked as if there was a towering avatar that rose all the way up to heaven standing over Roel, looking down upon all beings beneath. This sight shook Felder\u2019s heart.The two swords collided with one another, but shockingly, the renowned Marquess Elric was actually sent staggering backward.\u201cYou are a heretic!\u201dFelder roared furiously. He was certain that the avatar he saw standing over the black-haired boy was not a hallucination. While he wasn\u2019t certain of the origin of the avatar, he was convinced that it was the god of a heretical cult. Only an ancient god could make an Origin Level 3 transcendent like him stiffen up with just a single glance.Since the black-haired boy was a heretic, why did he choose to side with Victoria?Felder couldn\u2019t understand it, but there was one thing that he did know\u2014the boy standing before him was an extremely dangerous individual. If he couldn\u2019t force this boy into submission, he would surely pose a huge threat to His Highness Wade\u2019s ambitions in the future.Killing intent raged in Felder\u2019s eyes as he raised his sword and charged forth once more. Even if it would bring him Wade\u2019s criticism later on, he was determined to eliminate this dangerous variable standing before him.On the other hand, Roel knew well that he was invincible for these 30 seconds, that was why he was making full use of this opportunity to go all out. At the very center of the battlefield between the two factions, a golden-haired man and a black-haired boy roared ferociously as they began engaged in a terrifying duel. A silver short sword clashed again and again with a white sword, producing powerful shockwaves that kept other soldiers at bay.And yet, in the midst of this intense battle, the System continued to tick on mercilessly, seemingly counting down the seconds to Roel\u2019s death.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - I Should Start By Making An ExamplePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 87: I Should Start By Making An Example\u30106\u2026 5\u2026\u3011The System\u2019s countdown was drowned out by Roel\u2019s roars as he went on his final rampage.Roel had no idea who Grandar was exactly, and it was likely that no one else in the world knew anything about him anymore. Nevertheless, there was no doubt that the spell Grandar had given him was extremely powerful. He was even able to gain the upper hand against the powerful Felder, albeit only for 30 seconds.Under Roel\u2019s relentless barrage of attacks, Felder quickly found himself suppressed. Roel\u2019s stats were actually only average except for his tremendous burst power, but this burst power was more than enough to curb Felder in close-quarters combat. It was fortunate that Felder was a veteran fighter with skills and agility far above Roel\u2019s, allowing him to stand his ground against the overpowered Roel in the short-run.Despite being overpowered by a child, Felder wasn\u2019t too worried, for he knew that Roel\u2019s burst of power could only be sustained for a very short period of time.Power and cost were two sides of the same coin in this world. Felder had seen Roel\u2019s true strength earlier, and the latter should only be Origin Level 6. Most likely, the reason why Roel could harness such great power and fight on par with him, an Origin Level 3 transcendent, was due to temporary undead reanimation of his body. However, such a status could only be sustained for a short period of time.Naturally, Roel wasn\u2019t oblivious to the limitations of Grandar\u2019s Promise either. It hadn\u2019t been long since he last experienced the overwhelming feeling of weakness once the spell duration ended. So, he knew that he would be rendered powerless if he couldn\u2019t end the battle within 30 seconds.In truth, when he failed to force Felder to retreat within the first 10 seconds, he had already known that he wouldn\u2019t be able to win the fight before time ran out. Nevertheless, he still continued to fight with all his might because he believed that he would be able to catch someone\u2019s attention.And he was right.\u30103\u2026\u3011As the countdown was about to hit zero, just like how heroes always appeared at the final moment, a man\u2019s voice suddenly sounded out of nowhere.\u201cChild, you did well. Hextongue: Center of Gravity.\u201dFrom the moment he heard those words, Roel knew that his gamble had paid off. At the same time, Grandar\u2019s Promise also finally came to an end.However, Felder was in no position to continue his offense anymore. There was a peculiar mana reaction occurring on the armor he was wearing. When he raised his head, he saw arrows and bloodied swords flying toward him from all directions.\u201cBastard! Are these little tricks all you\u2019re capable of, Ponte?!\u201dFelder furiously released his mana as the blood mist around him billowed. He glared at the smiling black-haired man standing in front of the boy he had been fighting against.Ponte Ascart, one of the powerhouses of the Saint Mesit Theocracy, as well as the leading figure of Princess Victoria\u2019s forces.When the two esteemed marquesses of the Theocracy locked eyes with one another, the atmosphere suddenly grew so fiery that it looked as if something big was going to happen.\u201cPonte, that boy is a heretic!\u201d\u201cWhat about it? Are you interested in him, Marquess Felder?\u201dPonte chuckled lightly at the infuriated golden-haired knight. He grabbed the exhausted Roel with his right hand while waving his left hand casually. Book pages suddenly manifested out of thin air and fluttered around him in huge quantities.\u201cPardon me for being unable to accompany you for long. As you can see, Marquess Felder, I am a busy man.\u201dBefore Felder could respond, Roel\u2019s line of sight was already covered with the book pages fluttering around him and Ponte. The sounds of the battlefield swiftly grew muffled before disappearing altogether. By the time the pages finally scattered apart, he found himself in the heart of Victoria\u2019s faction.\u201cTeacher!\u201d\u201cRoel!\u201dThe voices of two women sounded in the ears of the Ascart boys. Victoria visibly heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing that Ponte had successfully made his retreat whereas Nora leaped right toward Roel and embraced him tightly.\u201cOuch! Nora, it hurts!\u201dHaving used Grandar\u2019s Promise twice with barely any rest, Roel\u2019s body was aching everywhere, and Nora\u2019s tight hug nearly sent him into the arms of the Maker. Nora quickly loosened her grip upon hearing his exclamation.\u201cS-sorry, I didn\u2019t do it intentionally.\u201dNora couldn\u2019t contain her worry and began examining Roel from head-to-toe to check on his condition. Seeing this, Victoria couldn\u2019t help but shoot a deep look at Roel.This child sure is adorable. Somehow, he seems to resemble teacher quite a bit. However, Nora\u2019s response seems to be\u2026Victoria turned her gaze toward Nora with a contemplative look in her eyes.Meanwhile, Ponte had gotten back to work.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to save our supplies! Archers, cover the retreating soldiers! Everyone, we\u2019re retreating!\u201dPonte didn\u2019t let loose just because he had returned back to safety. He began channeling his mana into the colorful gemstone, causing the gem to glow brilliantly. The fog all around swiftly grew thicker at a visible pace.The crimson lightning summoned by Wade was still trying its best to ward off the prowess of the labyrinth, but it was almost like trying to keep the rain at bay by lighting up a campfire. Both Wade and Ponte were Origin Level 3 transcendents, but Ponte had a decisive advantage due to the differences in equipment and terrain. Wade didn\u2019t stand a chance at all.Victoria\u2019s forces made full use of the concealment of the thick fog to retreat. It was obvious that the soldiers had been specially instructed beforehand from how they showed no hesitation in forsaking their weapons and turning tail to flee desperately. It was baffling to see those soldiers willingly casting aside their precious equipment, but admittedly, it was effective. Nearly all of the soldiers who were still able to move managed to make their escape.Unyielding perseverance for survival, this was the most valuable quality for the weaker Victoria\u2019s forces at the moment.Sensing that they had finally managed to shake the enemy off their tail, Ponte heaved a sigh of relief. His breathing audibly became heavier, showing that he had indeed exerted himself significantly from diving into the heart of the battle twice and forcefully activating the labyrinth artifact. However, compared to the other member of the Ascart House present, he was at least in a much more acceptable condition.Roel had been trudging forward under Nora\u2019s support all this while, but after seeing that the enemy troops were nowhere in sight anymore, the obstinacy pulling him together finally snapped. He succumbed to the severe fatigue and passed out against Nora\u2019s shoulder.\u2026A day later, in the Labyrinth Villa.\u201cIs that child still in the room?\u201dStanding by the windows of the lounge, Ponte glanced at Victoria, who was closing the metal door after entering the room, and enquired about the conditions of the two children. Victoria nodded her head in response.\u201cI asked her, but she doesn\u2019t want to come out. It hasn\u2019t been long since her bloodline awakening ended\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s her name again? How old is she?\u201d\u201cNora, 10 years old.\u201dPonte looked out of the window silently while deliberating over her words. Victoria slowly made her way over to his side.\u201cSilver Bloodline at 10 years old? That must be rare even for your lineage.\u201d\u201cIndeed\u2026 At the very least, her talents surpass both mine and Wade\u2019s,\u201d replied Victoria with a bitter smile.This was the first time that she was unable to match up to someone else in terms of talent.\u201cIs it fine? I mean, for one of your kin to possess so much potential.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not particularly interested in the pursuit of power. The presence of more talents in the Xeclyde House is good news to me. Teacher, shouldn\u2019t you know this the best?\u201dVictoria sighed deeply. She was suddenly reminded of her twin brother, Wade. The two of them had been so alike before their mother passed away, but in the short span of a few years, everything had changed.\u201cSpeaking of which, Victoria, don\u2019t you think that\u2026 there\u2019s something peculiar about the two children?\u201dPonte was a little hesitant when he spoke those words, and Victoria also didn\u2019t respond to his question right away either. Instead, the latter fell deep in thought.Indeed, there\u2019s something amiss with those two children, especially their clothes. The fact that they are wearing such luxurious, noble clothing goes to show that they aren\u2019t forgotten, illegitimate children wandering on the streets. Instead, it\u2019s more likely that they were entrusted to some noble house to raise. But, if that\u2019s the case, I should have already heard about them by now, especially given their conspicuous appearances.\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s one thing for an offspring of the royal family to be here, but it\u2019s far too much of a coincidence for a child from teacher\u2019s house to be here too. Not to mention, they are even acquainted with one another.\u201dIs it the norm for wandering illegitimate children to huddle together with one another for warmth nowadays?Such a thought inexplicably surfaced in Victoria\u2019s mind, but she quickly shook her head to refute it. On the other hand, Ponte maintained his silence as he pondered about the matter more deeply.In his view, it wasn\u2019tunthinkablefor the Ascart House to have descendants out on the streets, especially since there were several preceding patriarchs who had suddenly gone missing. No, what really intrigued him were the abilities and equipment the child possessed.Ponte stroked the short sword lying next to him and remarked.\u201cThe fact that the boy named Roel is in possession of Ascendwing goes to show that His Eminence Ryan is already aware of their existence. It\u2019s just a pity that His Eminence isn\u2019t in the capital at the moment, or else we would have been able to consult him on this matter.\u201d\u201cI really don\u2019t know what my father is thinking of\u2026\u201dVictoria and Ponte\u2019s train of thoughts were getting further and further away from the truth. The most pitiful one of all was probably Holy Eminence Ryan, who, despite being far away in the Austine Empire, was being viewed with scorn by his daughter for \u2018secretly harboring an illegitimate child\u2019.\u201cStill, I must say that I\u2019m surprised that the child of your Ascart House was able to hold Felder off for so long.\u201d\u201cYou saw it?\u201d\u201cOf course! All of the soldiers standing on the frontlines saw it. That child fought off the enemy general in the heart of the battlefield! I am certain that this matter has already spread far and wide amongst the soldiers.\u201dVictoria offered a rare high compliment toward the prowess Roel displayed on the battlefield. On the other hand, however, Ponte\u2019s expression grew a little grim. The other soldiers had been kept at bay due to the shockwaves produced by the collision between Roel and Felder\u2019s swords, but Ponte had caught a clear glimpse into Roel\u2019s powers.\u201cThat ability of his originates from a heretical cult. You should be aware of that too, right?\u201d\u201cSo what? My mother was a heretic too, but does that mean that she\u2019s evil? Teacher, are you trying to sound me out here?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m just worried that you\u2019ll feel uncomfortable about this.\u201d\u201cWhy would I feel uncomfortable about this? Besides, Nora and that child\u2019s relationship\u2026\u201dA warm smile crept onto Victoria\u2019s lips as she spoke. This \u2018little sister\u2019 of hers had rushed over to Roel\u2019s side to stand by him despite barely getting out of danger herself. The emotions that drove such actions were something Victoria herself could deeply relate with.She turned to look at her companion beside her with a stare so intent that it made Ponte cough in discomfort.\u201cThe two of them appear to have gone through numerous crises with one another, I can tell that their feelings run deep. Teacher, don\u2019t you think that their situation is very similar to ours?\u201d\u201cI-I don\u2019t think so? I-I already have a family.\u201d\u201cA family, huh? Are you referring to your wife-in-name whom you have not met for almost a decade now?\u201dAfter rendering Ponte speechless with her cutting words, Victoria turned her head away with a cold harrumph. She shot a glance at the room the two children were in, and somehow, she saw shadows of her and Ponte in them.I wonder if I can make this old tree flower if I could pair those two children together.Victoria glanced at the man beside her as her thoughts began to wander.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 - Who Can Stand This?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88: Who Can Stand This?\u201cWe meet again\u2026 Amongst those whom I have bestowed my power upon, you\u2019re the first one to reunite with me so quickly.\u201dOn a blood-colored plain, a humongous skeleton with a crown atop its skull gazed down on a small child with curiosity gleaming in his eyes.\u201cThose who attain my power treasure it dearly, not daring to use it recklessly. This is the first time I saw someone using it twice in a single day.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the purpose of seeking power to put it to good use? To utilize it in an appropriate moment to achieve what would otherwise be impossible\u2014I believe that\u2019s the best way to use power, and that\u2019s what I did.\u201dRoel raised his head to look up at the towering Grandar as he revealed his thoughts. The skeleton contemplated silently for a moment before nodding his head.\u201cYou\u2019re right. Power exists to be used; it\u2019s meaningless to hold back one\u2019s power just for the sake of it.\u201dGrandar\u2019s mood seemed to have lifted a little upon hearing Roel\u2019s thoughts. He hunched forward, lying down on the red stones of the plain and minimizing his distance from Roel\u2014a gesture symbolizing his interest in this small lad.\u201cSince ancient times, warriors would display their courage and strength on the battlefield in order to win respect, and this respect would accord them authority, eventually becoming their base of power. It\u2019s the case for your second battle. The soldiers have witnessed your valiance, and that\u2019ll go a long way in the future.\u201cWhat about your first battle though? Why did you choose to fight? Was it for that little angel?\u201dRoel quietly pondered Grandar\u2019s question. His battle with Peter Kater at the monastery was a discreet one, such that no one witnessed the process. Killing Peter Kater didn\u2019t bring him any honor or rewards, and the process was fraught with dangers too.\u201cI killed Peter Kater because he deserves to die. He has committed too many vile deeds, and his existence is a blemish to mankind. I protected Nora because I felt that she\u2019s worthy of my protection. She\u2019s upright, kind\u2026 While she does have a few weird quirks, she distinguishes between right and wrong and uses her power with good intent. Is there anything wrong with me choosing to protect her?\u201dRoel also sat down on the ground casually after seeing that Grandar had taken a relaxed position. As he questioned his heart for the reasons behind his decision back then, thoughts of Nora flashed across his mind, and the answer seemed to flow naturally afterward.On the other hand, Grandar\u2019s eyes twinkled a little after hearing the answer. A long while later, he finally remarked.\u201cI understand. You wish to mate her.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201dGrandar\u2019s response left Roel wide-eyed. Roel lifted his head to stare at the humongous skeleton above him as redness swiftly flushed his suave yet adorable face.\u201cWhat are you talking about?! When have I ever said that? \u2026 I\u2019m still a kid!\u201d\u201cHm? Is that not so? Do you not wish to mate her?\u201d\u201cW-what mate or not mate? That\u2019s not the point at all!\u201d exclaimed Roel loudly in embarrassment. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that I\u2019m doing the right thing here! How did your thoughts manage to wander so far off?\u201dRoel\u2019s reasoning made Grandar fall silent once more. The glimmer in his eyes flickered as he seemed to recall ancient history.\u201c\u2026 The right thing, hm? Is it even possible to define anything as right in this world? Often, those who believe that they are doing the right thing don\u2019t end well.\u201dGrandar\u2019s words carried a slight hint of melancholy. Sharply noticing the fluctuation in the skeleton\u2019s tone, Roel\u2019s eyes narrowed a little.\u201cIn defining whether something is right or not, I believe that we can classify them into absolute correctness and relative correctness. It depends on which one you are looking at.\u201d\u201cTell me more about it.\u201d\u201cAbsolute correctness refers to an unbending, universally accepted truth. For example, if I were to say that I\u2019m a human, that\u2019s an objective truth. As for relative correctness, it\u2019s more subjective. Take my act of killing Peter Kater for example\u2026\u201cFrom my point of view, Peter Kater is a despicable individual who has no qualms committing the vilest of deeds, which is why I believe I am justified in killing him. However, in the eyes of organizations that are hostile to mankind, Peter Kater could very well be viewed as a hero to them.\u201cIn other words, depending on the perspective you look at the matter from, the conclusion you arrive at will vary as well. So, which type of correctness are you looking at here?\u201d asked Roel.Grandar didn\u2019t answer Roel\u2019s question right away. Instead, he returned to his thoughts and considered the matter deeply, not moving at all. For a long while, only the whistling of the wind could be heard on this plain.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m probably looking at the latter.\u201dThe humongous skeleton finally answered, before he rose back up to his feet. Lots of rock pieces and dust fell from the crevices of his body, causing Roel to quickly cover his mouth to prevent anything from falling in.\u201cRoel Ascart, right? Your thoughts interest me. You have already used the spell I have given you twice. The next time we meet, you\u2019ll have to give me an answer to my question.\u201dGrandar reminded Roel in hopes that the latter would spend some time to think it over carefully. Amidst the cloud of dust around him, all Roel could do was to nod his head.\u201cThat\u2019s all then. You may return now.\u201dAfter those words were spoken, Roel\u2019s surroundings began to vanish into darkness. By the time everything disappeared, Roel lost his consciousness.\u2026\u201c\u2026 Roel\u2026 Roel!\u201d\u201cCough! No-Nora!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re finally awake!\u201dAs soon as Roel opened his eyes, he saw a beautiful face appearing right before his eyes. This face was looking at him worriedly. Before he could even make sense out of what was happening, a pair of arms had already wrapped around his body tightly.\u201cW-wait! Ah? It doesn\u2019t hurt anymore\u2026\u201dRoel instinctively jolted from the remembered trauma and excruciating pain of the previous hug, but surprisingly, all he felt was Nora\u2019s soft body and her lingering fragrance.He began taking a look around him and realized that he was in a bedroom. This bedroom was lacking in some of the required furniture, as if someone had just barely put it together last minute, but the aesthetic was still fairly decent.Wait a moment. This room\u2026It didn\u2019t take Roel too long to notice that the room he was in was extremely familiar. He shot a glance at the doorway, where a heavy metal door was attached with a door viewer. Through this, he was able to easily figure out his current location.Looks like I\u2019m back here once more.There was only one house in the world he could think of that had door viewers on every single doo r\u2014the Labyrinth Villa. In any case, being in this somewhat familiar environment made Roel heave a sigh of relief.At the same time, Nora also heaved a sigh of relief too. She continued hugging Roel for a while before she finally calmed down and began speaking.\u201cYou had a nightmare earlier on. Your breathing suddenly became ragged. You really scared me.\u201d\u201cAh? Oh, that\u2026\u201dRoel recalled the slight moment of anxiety he had when the world around him faded after bidding farewell to Grandar, and he immediately understood what was going on. He first assured Nora that he was fine before asking about their current circumstances.As it turned out, after the battle ended with a retreat, both Roel and Nora were brought over to the Labyrinth Villa, the main camp of Victoria\u2019s forces, to be treated. Nora successfully awakened her bloodline to Silver-tier under Victoria\u2019s assistance, and Roel was also put under the care of skilled doctors.While Roel was being treated, they conveniently conducted a blood test between him with Ponte through a spell. It was confirmed. He carried the bloodline of the Ascarts.Also, it would appear that they were unable to inform Victoria and Ponte about their true identities as time travelers from the future. It was almost as if someone had cast a spell on them, restricting their speech. Roel wasn\u2019t too surprised to hear that, and he had no problem with it since explaining the situation would be a huge hassle anyway.After going through two life-and-death situations, Roel just felt blessed to still be alive. He leaned his chin on Nora\u2019s shoulder and relished in the human warmth. He never thought that it was possible for him to feel so fulfilled so easily.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNora, this incident happened due to a problem in my bloodline. I was the one who dragged you into danger. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? My grandfather played a part in the awakening of your bloodline too. Besides\u2026 you were the one who protected me back then from the clutches of that evil cultist.\u201dNora chuckled sweetly upon hearing Roel\u2019s words, and she hugged him even tighter than before. On the other hand, Roel was surprised to hear that she was actually aware of that.\u201cDummy. By sound, of course,\u201d replied Nora with a helpless smile.Thinking back to the night when she lay helplessly amidst the shrieks of drifting specters, Roel\u2019s actions had really shook her heart to its core. Ever since she was young, she had never lacked protection from others before. Be it out of responsibility, duty, or kinship, those around her were inclined to brave through danger to ensure her safety.Holy Eminence John had once told her that she should grasp her life with her own hands, as humans were simply far too vulnerable to falling into depravity. It was inevitable that she would face betrayal from the ones close to her.\u201cOnly a person who truly loves you will be willing to put his all on the line for your sake. However, are you willing to allow such a person to make a sacrifice for you?\u201dIt was only now Nora really understood the meaning behind Holy Eminence John\u2019s words back then, and she had found an answer to that question too.No, she couldn\u2019t allow that. She was terrified that it might happen even.\u201cI am the stronger one here. I should have been the one protecting you\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense. As a man, I can\u2019t allow you to be the only one braving through danger.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t do. You\u2019re mine. You\u2019ll have to seek my permission before sustaining any injuries, understood?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by\u2026\u201dThinking that Nora was teasing him yet again, Roel immediately refuted her words. However, to his surprise, Nora suddenly sat upright and clasped his hands in hers sincerely.\u201cPerhaps not yet, but I\u2019m willing to make an advanced payment first.\u201dIt was not the usual mischievous smile on Nora\u2019s face but one of concern and worry. Her tender expression was so different from how she usually acted that it made Roel\u2019s heart suddenly start pounding.\u201cRoel, I\u2019ll protect and care for you. I shall become your protector. This is a vow I\u2019m making to myself, and I shall devote my life to fulfilling it.\u201dNora\u2019s sudden confession left Roel reeling. He finally understood why Nora was giving off such an incongruous vibe to him. This time, Nora was not teasing him for the sake of fulfilling her sadistic desires. Rather, she was expressing her true heart to him.This sudden change in tactics was fatal; Roel felt his defenses swiftly crumbling.\u201cW-what are you talking about? It\u2019s out of my own will that I chose to kill Peter Kater. You don\u2019t need to do this.\u201d\u201cYou might not need it, but I\u2019m willing to do it.\u201d\u201cW-wait a moment. Just stay silent for a while\u2026\u201dRoel felt blood rushing into his head. His cheeks were burning, and there was a slight itch in his chest. His mind was so overwhelmed that he was unable to process the situation.Fortunately for him, someone arrived on time to rescue him from this quandary.\u201cHow loving the two of you are! Do children nowadays start whispering sweet nothings to one another at such a young age? Well, at least this is better than a cowardly grown man who dares not do anything at all!\u201dAn envious teasing sounded in the air.The door opened, and Victoria walked in together with a bitter looking black-haired man behind her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 - Should I Pimp or Not?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 89: Should I Pimp or Not?Hm? This woman really resembles Nora\u2026This was Roel\u2019s reaction when he first set eyes on Victoria. She looked so nearly identical to Nora that it was impossible for him not to be surprised. However, he soon snapped out of it.As someone who had played the game in his previous life, Roel knew very well that the similarity was only temporary. In terms of facial features, there would probably not be many differences, but when it came to their figure\u2026Let\u2019s just say that Nora will become much more shapely compared to the regrettably childlike Victoria.Doing a rough estimate, Victoria was likely in her twenties, but her body was a proportionate enlargement of the 10-year-old Nora.Roel\u2019s attention switched over to the black-haired man standing behind Victoria, and he couldn\u2019t help questioning his knowledge.Wait a moment, that isn\u2019t right. Based on the diaries left behind by Ponte, isn\u2019t Victoria his type then? Why did he end up rejecting her?Initially, Roel thought that Ponte was some scum who went around flirting with younger girls, but as they started conversing, he soon realized that their relationship was more complicated than he had imagined. Not only was Victoria a \u2018legal loli\u2019, but she seemed to have some sort of leverage over Ponte that allowed her to curb him entirely.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cTeacher, it\u2019s great to see how close they are to one another.\u201d\u201cY-yeah, indeed.\u201d\u201cNow that I think about, there are nobles that have begun opposing conventional political marriages, especially those in the younger generation. Those old-fashioned ideas about having to choose between responsibility to one\u2019s house and happiness are gradually being rejected.\u201dNaturally, Ponte understood the deeper meaning behind Victoria\u2019s words, and he shook his head helplessly. Nevertheless, Roel could see that, to a certain extent, Ponte did dote on her. The two of them appeared to have each other in their hearts.Roel didn\u2019t just look at their interactions but the atmosphere around them and the subtle gestures they made too. While Victoria had hidden it well, from time to time, she would still exude a certain disposition that he was deeply familiar with. He shot a glance toward the well brought up Nora, and he suddenly understood where her sadistic tendencies had originated from.It\u2019s a hereditary trait that shows up once every few generations, huh?Perhaps it was because she had sensed Roel\u2019s thoughts, but Nora suddenly turned her head over and stared at him. Under her intent gaze, he quickly averted his eyes, only to be met with Ponte\u2019s gaze right after. The two boys of the Ascart House exchanged looks, and they suddenly felt a sense of camaraderie with one another.It was a feeling of deep connection created by mutual sympathy for one another, due to suffering through the same plight. They were like oppressed peasants ready to raise up in arms against the Xeclyde girls\u2026\u2026 though it was not as if they would really dare to do so. Their rebellion would probably just be quelled in an instant.Ponte and Victoria talked about a lot of stuff with Roel and Nora, but surprisingly, they didn\u2019t question their identities. They seemed to believe that Holy Eminence Ryan had been hiding these two children, and it was only due to the sudden outbreak of chaos that their existence was revealed.Naturally, Roel was more than willing to pin it all on the faraway Ryan. Nora was a little conflicted about soiling her predecessor\u2019s reputation, but she still chose to keep her silence as well.\u201cChild, you must have suffered a lot over the years. You have to believe that our father is not someone who would abandon any of his family members. I don\u2019t know what Wade has told you, but his words can\u2019t be trusted. He\u2019s walking down the path of a tyrant.\u201dVictoria grabbed Nora\u2019s hand as she began to counsel her \u2018little sister\u2019 warmly. Seeing these two sadists acting so gently with one another made Roel\u2019s eyelids twitch in discomfort. He shot a glance at Ponte and saw an expression of astonishment on his ancestor\u2019s face too.\u201cMister Ponte, I have some questions regarding our lineage that I wish to ask you about. Is it convenient for you now?\u201dRoel made use of this opportunity to speak to his predecessor, and Ponte also nodded in response to his question, not putting on airs at all.\u201cYour name is Roel, right? I am the current patriarch of the Ascart House, so feel free to ask me anything regarding our family.\u201dAs the patriarch of a house suffering from a lack of offspring, Ponte hoped that the family tree could expand a little bit more. A member of the side family like Roel didn\u2019t have the right to succeed the Ascart House, so it was unlikely that he would get into any internal strife with the other family members. If he accepted Roel into the family, there would be another pair of helping hands to rely on when crises occur.In view of this, Ponte wasn\u2019t averse to Roel\u2019s sudden appearance.It was just that, to his surprise, Roel asked not about returning back to the Ascart House but one of the core secrets surrounding their lineage.\u201cMister Ponte, our lineage has a hereditary bloodline, right? Can you give me more information about it?\u201dRoel looked at Ponte with a firm look in his eyes as he posed the question. On the other hand, Ponte was momentarily stunned before he suddenly recalled something. An anxious look appeared on his face as he asked.\u201cOne moment. The prowess you showed earlier on the battlefield, does it have anything to do with our family\u2019s bloodline?\u201d\u201cI think so\u2026\u201dRoel\u2019s hesitant response made Ponte widen his eyes. Ponte instantly stood up and pulled Roel out of the room with him.\u201cChild, come with me!\u201d\u201cAh? Ponte, where are you leading the child off to?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re heading to the study. There\u2019s something I need to discuss with this child in private. You need not pay us any heed.\u201dAfter shaking off Victoria and Nora, Ponte led the perplexed Roel through numerous metal doors before finally arriving at the study. The room appeared much emptier compared to how Roel remembered it. The two of them settled down around a table.Ponte didn\u2019t rush right into the topic but, instead, prepared two cups of tea for them. There was a long pause as if he was sorting out his thoughts before he began speaking.\u201cI thought that you were a heretic, but it looks like it\u2019s something\u2026 more than that. If you have really awakened the bloodline of our Ascart House, it would really be a huge matter.\u201d\u201cMister Ponte, what do you mean?\u201d\u201cAs a long-standing noble house, the Ascart House does have a hereditary bloodline, but it has nearly died out by now. We don\u2019t know when our hereditary bloodline began fading, but ever since the start of the Third Epoch, we have already lost the means to awaken it.\u201d\u201cAhhh, I see\u2026 Does that mean that it\u2019s bad news that I have managed to awaken our hereditary bloodline?\u201dRoel was a little confused about this. Judging by the grim look on Ponte\u2019s face, it seemed like the awakening of his bloodline wasn\u2019t something to rejoice over. He couldn\u2019t understand why gaining greater power was a bad thing here.Ponte smiled bitterly in response to Roel\u2019s words.\u201cIt\u2019s rare for our family members to naturally awaken our hereditary bloodline the way you did, but in the past few centuries, two of our predecessors have managed to do it. However, do you know what kind of fate befell them?\u201d\u201cDid something bad happen to them?\u201d\u201cThe two of them went missing. To this day, we still don\u2019t know what happened to them.\u201dRoel was speechless. He suddenly recalled the \u2018Extremely Dangerous\u2019 notification that the System warned him with. Could it be that this warning referred not to the process of awakening but to the events that would be triggered as a result of the awakening?\u201cWinstor Ascart and Ro Ascart, these are the names of the predecessors who managed to naturally awaken our hereditary bloodline. They served as the patriarch during their time, and the Ascart House grew to new heights in their hands. However, after a short period of prosperity under their leadership, they suddenly vanished from the face of the world; that resulted in the decline of the house for the next decade afterward.\u201dRecalling the historical records left behind by the ancestors of the Ascart House, Ponte sighed deeply. Roel took some time to straighten out his thoughts before he decided to inquire deeper into Winstor and Ro Ascart\u2019s affairs.\u201cMister Ponte, are there any links between the disappearances of the two patriarchs?\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t any significant links between their disappearances, but one thing worthy of note is that the two of them were avid adventurers. Before they went missing, they would often spend long periods of time traveling around the continent, exploring ancient ruins. According to the records, the two of them were unimaginably powerful, so it\u2019s unlikely for them to have been assassinated\u2026 My guess is that they lost their lives in the midst of exploring an ancient ruin.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 Do you know what is the ability of our Ascart House\u2019s hereditary bloodline?\u201dRoel felt a little uncomfortable hearing the plights of his two predecessors as it seemed to cast an ominous portent for his future too. He hesitated for a moment before deciding to ask one of the key questions.Unexpectedly, Ponte fell silent upon hearing that question. A bizarre silence lingered in the air for a long moment before he finally squeezed a few words out.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cHuh? Why?\u201d\u201cThe ability of our hereditary bloodline is not stated in the family records.\u201d\u201cA-ah\u2026 I didn\u2019t think that it would be like that.\u201dRoel was quite taken aback by the answer, and Ponte quickly elaborated with reddened cheeks.\u201cOur records aren\u2019t complete; there are some portions that have gone missing over the generations. Nevertheless, based on what\u2019s left, it seems like the two patriarchs have difficulties trying to depict what the ability of the bloodline is. Furthermore, their abilities differed from one another too. The only commonality between the patriarchs is that they were both history buffs, devoting their lives to uncovering the past.\u201dPonte looked a little stifled as he spoke, thinking that the information he had wasn\u2019t helpful at all. However, Roel felt that his mind was ready to explode after listening to the key points of Ponte\u2019s short description. \u2018Uncovering history\u2019, wasn\u2019t that precisely what he was doing at this very moment?Thinking about it, the Labyrinth Villa could be considered as a historical artifact in his own era. Roel felt like there were simply far too many mysteries surrounding the Ascart House and its hereditary bloodline.\u201cI\u2019m not telling you all of this to intimidate you. I just hope to offer you some advice so that the same plight doesn\u2019t befall you.\u201d\u201cAdvice?\u201d\u201cIndeed. I would advise you not to wander around carelessly, but I suspect that there\u2019s a good chance that our hereditary bloodline requires you to go around uncovering ancient remains. That being said, I hope you can realize that great power comes with great risks. The two predecessors who brought our Ascart House to greater heights ended up dying prematurely. Just because something is within reach doesn\u2019t mean that you have to grasp it. Living a peaceful life is also a viable option for you.\u201dRoel could feel the sincerity behind Ponte\u2019s words. He knew that Ponte was showing him earnest concern as an elder in the family, and he was touched by the gesture too\u2026 but it didn\u2019t seem like living a peaceful life was a viable option for him anymore. As one destined to become a villain in the future, it was likely that trouble would come knocking on his door even if he chose to remain still.\u201cYou\u2019re on good terms with that child named Nora?\u201d\u201cAh? Why are you suddenly asking this question? I guess it\u2019s still alright\u2026\u201d\u201cSometimes, it isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing to rely on the royal family a little\u2026\u201dWhat should I do? My predecessor is blatantly telling me to pimp myself out to Nora! Should I heed his advice or not?Roel stared at Ponte numbly. Somehow, even though the two of them weren\u2019t married, Ponte was looking more and more like a henpecked husband under Victoria\u2019s tyrannical rule.Roel\u2019s first reaction was to reject Ponte\u2019s suggestion, but he suddenly recalled those words that Nora had just spoken to him earlier in the room, and it made his face redden a little. He lowered his head to ponder over it for a while.Just as he was about to give his response, Ponte suddenly took out a book and a pen and began jotting something down,\u300c9th March, sunny.\u2026\u300dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This must be how a child stumbling upon his father playing as a female vtuber would feel.Alright, the metaphor was a little too visceral, and Roel couldn\u2019t help but shudder thinking about it. Still, the sense of humiliation he felt was about the same!\u300c9th March, sunny.Today\u2019s Victoria wore the attire of a nun while treating the children\u2019s wounds. She was so cute even though her measurements haven\u2019t changed at all over the past three years.\u300dRoel stared at the criminally disposed man writing in his diary, eyes filled with scorn, almost as if he was looking at the vilest scum of society. He wondered if he should spit on the latter to fully express the contempt he held.\u201cAh, about this, hahaha\u2026 It\u2019s the price of my magic, so you need not pay it any heed.\u201dNoticing the disdain dripping from Roel\u2019s gaze, the embarrassed Ponte quickly began explaining himself.Ponte\u2019s Evolution Pathway was Chronicler from Brolne\u2019s Wisdom Origin Attribute. It was an advancement belonging to the Hextongue Faction. On the battlefield, Ponte was capable of calmly toying with his enemies, seemingly in full control of the situation. His performance remarkable; his appearance dashing. However, that all came at a bitter price\u2014writing this embarrassing, perverted diary.To make matters worse, he had to complete his journal entries before the eyes of another, and he was disallowed from destroying the diaries he had written.In the past, he had always written it before his pupil, Victoria, which led to her having a tight grasp over his weaknesses. Fortunately, Victoria was the type of person who looked imposing on the surface but was a softie inside. Not to mention, she was fond of Ponte too, so she could be trusted with this matter.Listening to Ponte\u2019s woes, Roel couldn\u2019t help but remember the entire shelf of diaries he found in the modern-day Labyrinth Villa, and he suddenly felt a great deal of sympathy for this ancestor of his. Ponte probably would never have imagined that this embarrassing history of his would remain safely guarded in this study even a hundred years later.After ending their conversation, Roel and Ponte finished up their tea before heading back to check-in with Victoria and Nora. To their surprise, they stumbled upon a particularly disturbing discussion.\u201cActually, I\u2019m not having much progress on my side either.\u201d\u201cHeh, hoping for them to make a move is almost the same as wishing for pigs to fly. Listen to me, you need to be force\u2026 Ah, you are back.\u201dSeeing that the two Ascart boys walking into the room, Victoria hurriedly halted her teachings and directed a winsome smile at the pair. However, Ponte and Roel only felt a chill running down their spines.\u201cWhat did the two of you talk about?\u201d\u201cNothing much\u2026 just the future of our bloodline.\u201dVictoria\u2019s response invoked a deep red blush on Nora\u2019s face. On the other hand, Roel and Ponte second-guessed their initial doubts.Yeah, I must have been hearing things. There\u2019s no way that the respected members of royalty would be interested in discussing such mundane matters!Roel thought to himself with a smile, and Ponte also set his heart at ease.It was soon to be lunchtime and Victoria and Ponte wanted to have a good meal with their newly-found kin. Considering that they were in the midst of war, there was no way their meals could be luxurious, but it was at least still filling and nourishing. It was especially good for Roel, who had lost quite a bit of blood recently.They continued chatting amiably over the meal, and Roel found an opportunity to ask Victoria for her reasons for opposing Wade. Unexpectedly, her motive was not some great compassion for mankind or other righteous cause. On the contrary, she had a very practical reason behind it.The simple explanation is that Wade hoped to build a massive empire reminiscent of the Ancient Austine Empire, so as to unite the forces of mankind to fight against external threats, but Victoria thought that the chances of pulling it off were extremely slim.\u201cThe Theocracy is strong, but Pendor and Austine aren\u2019t easy opponents. While the Country of Scholars, Brolne, is close to the Theocracy at the moment, if the Theocracy invades other countries, there\u2019s a good chance that Brolne will change its stance.\u201cWade hopes to assimilate heretics into the Theocracy and create a more equal world. I have no objections regarding that, but his extreme methods are very risky. It has been a long time since the last Holy War, and the chances of deviants invading West Sia are increasing with each passing year. Initiating a war right now would only lower the overall strength of mankind.\u201cI do not wish to see my mother\u2019s tragedy happening to anyone else, but I believe that changes should be made step-by-step. We should start off with assimilating the non-religious transcendent factions before moving on to the heretics. Initiating change from within won\u2019t be easy, but we\u2019ll be able to minimize the risk and damage this way.\u201dAfter hearing Victoria\u2019s standpoint, Roel found it hard to evaluate her stand. Victoria and Wade appeared to have similar goals in mind, but the way they wished to go about it was different. Victoria was a more conservative individual, whereas Wade was a revolutionary; it was no wonder why they couldn\u2019t see eye-to-eye.However, Victoria\u2019s worries about the deviants invading the Sia Continent did eventually come to be, just that it only happened a century later. She was right yet not really so.Looking at Victoria and Ponte, Roel couldn\u2019t help but ponder about a question: Just what was this world he was currently in? Did he and Nora really return back to the past?Roel personally didn\u2019t believe in time travel, due to the many paradoxes that could occur as a result of changing history. Rather, he believed more in diverging realities in parallel universes. If someone returned back to the past and changed history, rather than to say that he had changed the past, he would have just created another parallel universe.Could he be in some sort of illusion, similar to a lucid dream?That was the most direct explanation Roel could think of, but on further thought, he felt like he might be oversimplifying matters. There were far too many pieces of evidence to overturn that deduction. No matter how he looked at it, Victoria and Ponte were simply too real to shrug off as dream fragments.What he felt was more probable was that he had been transported over to an independent world that depicted a snippet of history, reminiscent of the world inside mirrors.Expanding on that theory, the bloodline of the Ascart House would be like an entrance ticket to enter this world, allowing him to become a Witness. As for what he would be witnessing, it could have been the important turning points of the world, the unyielding spirit of an individual, or some truth hidden in the annals of history. He didn\u2019t know for certain what it was, but it was simply his job to bear witness to it all.He had a feeling that this unique experience would become an invaluable impetus to both his and Nora\u2019s growth in the future, both in terms of maturity and as transcendents. However, the most important thing right now was for them to overcome the dangers lurking here first.Roel felt that he could somewhat understand why those two predecessors were unable to describe the abilities of the Ascart Bloodline. Despite experiencing it personally, even he would be unable to properly convey it in words. It felt a bit like the games he played in his previous world, where certain events would transport the player back in history to get a deeper understanding of the world background, but that didn\u2019t feel exactly right either.Roel continued eating while pondering the matter. It was then that Victoria suddenly dropped a bomb on him.\u201cSince you\u2019re already here, we\u2019ll do our best to ensure your safety. A battle will likely break out over the next two days, but you need not worry. We\u2019ll dispatch some men to escort you out safely.\u201d\u201cBattle? Why?\u201dRoel and Nora were astonished by Victoria\u2019s remark. Based on what they knew from history, Victoria\u2019s forces would continue holing themselves up inside the labyrinth until Holy Eminence Ryan finally returned to save the day. Therefore, they didn\u2019t think that any more battles would occur before then.There was a long moment of silence before Ponte finally explained the situation.It was all because they had moved out to save Nora and Roel. The huge battle Victoria\u2019s forces had with Wade\u2019s allied armies gave the latter a lot of opportunities to plant tracking spells on their soldiers. As a result of that, over the past day, Wade\u2019s allied armies had managed to make great progress, advancing very close to where the Labyrinth Villa was. At this rate, a battle would likely break out tomorrow.The news was shocking. Roel and Nora didn\u2019t expect things to turn out this way, but it did make perfect sense.\u201cYou need not blame yourself for this matter. Ponte and I made this decision knowing the risks at hand. If we lose this battle, you must make sure to lie low. The Holy Capital is large. As long as you use magic tools to conceal your whereabouts, you should be able to escape Wade\u2019s detection in the short-run.\u201dVictoria spoke with a prudent and gentle voice, and Ponte silently agreed with her view. It was obvious from their attitudes that they didn\u2019t have much confidence in the upcoming battle. They were worried that Roel and Nora would insist on staying behind in a moment of hot-bloodedness, which was a situation they wanted to avoid at all costs.Over the past two days, it was more than apparent to them that both Roel and Nora wielded great talents, and they had the potential to surpass the two of them in the future. They must never lose their lives in this ridiculous internal strife, or else it would be a huge loss to both their houses and the Theocracy.However, Roel and Nora didn\u2019t respond right away to Victoria and Ponte\u2019s advice.The lunch soon concluded, and Victoria and Ponte headed off to organize their soldiers and prepare them for the upcoming battle. On the other hand, Roel and Nora returned back to their room to rest, making full use of this quiet moment to think over what they had just heard.\u3010Countdown to the end of Witness State: 32 hours 45 minutes\u3011Roel looked at the System\u2019s notifications and saw that there was still a little less than a day and a half left until the Witness State would end. If they were to take a defensive stance, they should be able to buy enough time to survive until the very end. However, that was not what he was planning on doing.The Witness, Kingmaker, Grandar, the progress of his bloodline awakening\u2026 There were too many things at stake here, and they made Roel feel that he shouldn\u2019t choose to escape. The two life-or-death situations he had been through changed his evaluation significantly, which made him realize that he had to give up something in order to earn something.\u3010Evaluation: High (87)\u3011Roel looked at the significant rise in his evaluation, and needless to say, he was happy about it. However, there was one issue that he thought he needed to clarify.\u201cSystem, is it possible for the evaluation to go down?\u201d\u3010The Evaluation System is constantly updating itself based on the user\u2019s actions. It is possible for your evaluation to go down.\u3011The System\u2019s response made Roel wince a little. The fact that it was possible for him to lose marks meant that escaping was no longer an option anymore. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to raise his score this far, and he would only regret it for life if he were to allow his evaluation to fall due to a moment of cowardice.But, while Roel had made up his mind to stay, he felt that he had to advise Nora to leave. Nora wasn\u2019t going through an evaluation like he was, so there was no need for her to put herself through this risk.Such thoughts in mind, he went to Nora\u2019s room to talk to her about this matter. To his surprise, Nora\u2019s decision was not what he had expected.\u201cYou wish to stay here? Why? We\u2019ll be able to return back to our world in just one and a half days\u2019 time. You\u2019re putting yourself at risk for no reason!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euRoel couldn\u2019t accept Nora\u2019s obstinacy, but the latter had her own set of logic to back her choice.\u201cIt\u2019s against my principles and my Origin Attribute to turn my back against those who have saved my life, not to mention that they are my predecessors. The disconnect between my actions and my Origin Attribute will result in a contradiction in my newly awakened bloodline. Besides, aren\u2019t you staying too?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s different for me! I have a complicated reason behind that\u2026\u201dRoel told Nora about the condition regarding his bloodline, hoping that she would change her mind regarding this matter. However, she remained unwavering in her stance. From the sharp light in her sapphire eyes, it was clear that there was nothing he could say to change her mind.\u201cMy grandfather told me to come here to bear witness. Since that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s my duty to watch over my predecessors to the very end\u2026 Besides, I don\u2019t wish to part with you either.\u201dNora reached out to hold Roel\u2019s hands as she spoke. The determination and tenderness in her eyes made Roel sigh helplessly, The frustrated look on his face seemed to have entertained Nora as she chuckled softly. She raised her hand and poked his cheek mischievously.Under her teasing, Roel suddenly turned his head over and opened his mouth wide, as if he was going to bite down on her finger. But instead of retracting her finger, Nora pushed it closer to him instead.\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of me biting you?\u201d\u201cWill you hurt me? I think not.\u201d\u201cHmph. You sure have a high opinion of yourself.\u201dRoel turned his head away as he didn\u2019t want to deal with this damned sadist.Nora\u2019s decision to heed Holy Eminence John\u2019s instruction to witness this turning point of history could be considered as an internal matter within the Xeclyde House, which meant that Roel was in no position to tell her what to do. In any case, he still made up his mind to bring Nora safely out of this no matter what happened.While the two children in the Labyrinth Villa were affirming their determination, Victoria and Ponte had also finished organizing their forces. Amidst the fog, a vengeful prince and his knight were sharpening their blades. Everyone was making the final preparations for the upcoming battle.In this calm before the storm, a new day arrived.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 - The Clash of FaithsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 91: The Clash of FaithsWar broke out as promised the following morning. As soon as the fog dissipated along with the scattering of sunlight at dawn, the quiet streets outside the Labyrinth Villa became filled with deafening war cries.The battle escalated at an unimaginable rate, as both sides began going all out right away. The intentions of Wade\u2019s allied armies were made blatantly obvious\u2014they were planning to use everything within their means to crush the enemy and capture Victoria.The ranks of Wade\u2019s allied armies were filled with many heretics. While they were termed as heretics, the truth was that many of them were born in the Theocracy and grew up here, only to be discriminated against on the basis of their lineage and Origin Attributes. They felt that this was extremely unfair. Why should an otherwise upstanding member of society be discriminated against, just because they are deemed a heretic? Meanwhile, no matter how corrupted, any member of the Genesis Goddess Church can act as they please.This was a question without an answer in the current era; the conflicting moral compasses of the people wouldn\u2019t allow it; making it the greatest dilemma of the present age Theocracy.For these heretics, Wade\u2019s revolution was a ray of hope. It was an opportunity for them to challenge the system and create a new future for the next generation. They wished to build a new society that promoted equality, where people wouldn\u2019t be treated unfairly just on the basis of their lineage and Origin Attributes.To be honest, for the freethinker Roel from the modern era, he felt that the heretics were justified in their actions. Perhaps it was due to the firm conviction in their mission that the heretics showed unyielding determination, charging ahead without showing any fear of death.In order to quickly subdue Victoria\u2019s forces, they completely gave up on using arrows and long-ranged weapons for additional support. They used the tower shields in their hands to fend off the spells directing toward them while charging ahead with unstoppable momentum.Needless to say, such a death charge brought about great casualties, but whenever a soldier died, another one would swiftly rush forward to take his place. They grit their teeth and stood firm in their beliefs.The greatest strength of humans lay in their ability to overcome their primitive tendencies. It was in the nature of all living beings to avoid dangers, but for their faith and ideals, humans were willing to brave mortal danger. While this could go both ways, Roel felt that it was such a spirit that allowed human civilization to develop this far.However, it wasn\u2019t just the soldiers in Wade\u2019s faction that had conviction. Victoria\u2019s forces also carried justice in their hearts. As knights and military men serving the Theocracy, they were the guardians of the Theocracy, and they were duty-bound to ensure the peace and security of the common populace. The ones standing before them were enemies who had caused great casualties within the Holy Capital. It was their responsibility to stop them!Flags with hundreds of years of history were held high above their heads as the soldiers from Victoria\u2019s faction retaliated ferociously against the charging enemies. Even when their prestigious armor inscribed with the insignia of their affiliation was stained with blood, they still stood fearlessly against those who dared disturb the peace in the Holy Capital. Their honor was on the line here, and they wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to trample on it.The intense battlefield was like a meat-grinding machine. Not a single second passed without someone collapsing amidst a pool of blood. Soon, as the first face-off came to an end, the leaders of both factions entered the battlefield too. From the very back of their respective formations, the teacher-pupil duo faced the liege-subordinate duo. Both Victoria and Wade had complicated looks on their faces, but their eyes were firm and resolute.At the same time, Ponte stopped the labyrinth artifact too since it was pointless now that the enemy was already inside their hiding spot. Under the intense rays of the morning sun, the two royal siblings tried their last attempt at negotiation.\u201cMy royal sister, have you forgotten the tragedy our mother encountered? In order to prevent such a tragedy from occurring again, as well as for the greatness of the Theocracy, we need to put all of our strength together and push for a difficult but necessary change! To stop an inevitable revolution and be content with staying stagnant, how are you different from those nobles who brought about the death of our mother?\u201dBefore the soldiers of the two factions, Wade questioned Victoria\u2019s actions with a look of fury. He even resorted to mentioning the death of Consort Mary, something no one had talked about for a long time, the topic was too heavy and depressing. His speech brought about some unrest within Victoria\u2019s forces, shaking their morale. There were many soldiers who knew Consort Mary personally and felt deep sympathy for her plight.Even Victoria looked a little downcast being reminded of her deceased mother. Ponte reached to grab her hand and squeezed it, and she smiled in response to his warm gesture. She quickly calmed her emotions before she stepped forward and responded.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWade, I\u2019ll never forget what happened to our mother. I don\u2019t question your vengeance, but the revolution you seek comes at a heavy price. Look at what you have done so far. In less than a month, rivers of blood are already flowing through our beloved homeland! How many people have died for your ambitions? Do you feel no remorse over the innocent lives you have taken?\u201d\u201cSacrifices are inevitable in a revolution. In history, revolutions would always infringe on the interests of those in power. If we don\u2019t tear down the old systems, a new era will never arrive! What you preach are mere ideals that will never come to fruition! A revolution without blood will only be gradually stifled by the nobles and clergymen before eventually being extinguished!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t deny the possibility of what you have just said, but that\u2019s why the royal family exists! Our very responsibility is to become leaders that set a direction for the country and bring everyone toward a more desired future. If blood has to be shed in the process of doing so, I would rather it be mine than those of the innocent civilians! Wade, it\u2019s the blood of your very countrymen that is fueling your ambitions! Have you already forgotten the teachings of our house?\u201d\u201c\u2026 It looks like there\u2019s no way for us to come to a compromise.\u201d\u201cIt seems so.\u201dWith the two standing firm in their stances, the final negotiation broke down. Their words had guarded the morale of their respective factions, as well as driving in the fact that it was impossible for the two factions to come to an understanding. The soldiers tightened their grip on their weapons as they resolved themselves for a fight to the death.Wade drew his sword, and the golden-haired Felder at his side quickly followed suit. He turned around to face his own guards standing behind him, eyes filled with burning passion, and roared furiously.\u201cFor justice!\u201dWade\u2019s war slogan was responded to with a deafening war cry from his soldiers. He raised his sword up high as the symbol of revolutionary change. At this very moment, the morale of the soldiers rose to the peak.Similarly, Victoria and Ponte also stepped forward alongside one another and drew their swords in unison.\u201cFor peace!\u201dThey also received an earth-shattering roar in return, as if baring their fangs against their enemies. In terms of morale, it would appear that both armies were equally matched with one another.Following that, the war horns sounded, and the main forces of the two factions began charging at one another.\u201cAre the two of you ready?\u201d\u201cWe are ready, commander. Please feel free to return to your platoon.\u201d\u201cI understand. May Sia be with you.\u201dA towering knight commander bade Roel and Nora farewell before charging into the battlefield with his men.Roel, standing together with a pale-faced Nora, looked at the chaotic battlefield before him and sighed softly. He couldn\u2019t help feeling that this battle was nothing but a terrible tragedy. Thinking of the reasons behind it, there was no right or wrong, just a difference in opinion and ideals. Both Victoria and Wade sought the best for the Theocracy and their people, but their means simply differed from one another.For Nora, who had grown up with a clear sense of right and wrong under the indoctrination of the Genesis Goddess Church, she felt uncomfortable facing such a blurred sense of morality. She might have matured early, but ultimately, she only had 10 years of experience living in this world.No matter how talented she might be, this is still too much for a child to bear.Roel thought to himself as he shot a glance at Nora. All of a sudden, he felt Nora grasping his hand. He turned his head over and found himself faced with her eyes. Instead of carrying their usual confidence, her sapphire eyes reflected weakness and confusion. Her sudden show of vulnerability made Roel\u2019s heart violently skip a beat.\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t know who is right here. My grandfather has told me to bear witness, but I still don\u2019t know even after spending long hours thinking it over.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped\u2026 The world isn\u2019t so simple that we can simply divide everything into right and wrong. More often than not, it\u2019s just a difference in positions and perspectives.\u201dRoel\u2019s words brought some clarity back into Nora\u2019s eyes. She turned her head over to look at the commanding Princess Victoria, and determination slowly returned to her face.Roel wasn\u2019t too surprised by the changes Nora was going through, and a helpless smile emerged on his lips. It seemed like his words had struck a chord in Nora\u2019s heart. Yet, here he was, still wavering between both sides himself.There were still slightly more than 10 hours left until the end of the Witness State, and Roel knew that this was the crucial moment of the whole trial he was being put through. Whether he would be able to advance a step further and obtain the best rewards would depend on his choice and his actions here.While Roel and Nora were deep in their thoughts, Victoria turned to Ponte standing beside her and nodded her head. Ponte immediately caught her drift and stopped his bombardment of magic spells to take out a colorful gemstone.\u201cTeacher!\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dIndeed, Ponte had started using the labyrinth once more. It was their greatest trump card after all, so it was impossible for Victoria\u2019s weaker forces not to make use of it. From the very start, this battle had been a trap. Ponte had only released the labyrinth for so long in order to lure Wade\u2019s allied armies in deeper.The spell which he had been channeling for half a day since the arrival of dawn finally began working its magic. It took only a few moments for fog to settle in amongst the formation of Wade\u2019s allied armies, severely limiting their visibility. This was extremely dangerous as it impeded the military commanders\u2019 ability to assess the battlefield and make adjustments.So, Felder immediately ordered the army to charge ahead to further pressure Victoria\u2019s forces, and the opposition did likewise.As a result, the soldiers of the two factions crashed into one another like waves. The Knight Orders on Victoria\u2019s side, which had stationed on the nearby higher terrains ahead of the battle, rushed down along slopes and gained tremendous speed, allowing them to claim a decisive advantage in the first charge. Many of Wade\u2019s soldiers were skewered by their spears.However, the momentum of Wade\u2019s allied armies barely faltered at all. Their formation continued pushing ahead with great speed.At the same time, Wade had begun channeling the same crimson lightning spell once more, causing his body to be cloaked in a crimson glow. Innumerable lightning bolts crackled around him, dissipating the fog Ponte had summoned. However, the effects fell short as he was still unable to effectively dispel the fog and turn the tables around.Cloaked in the fog, the soldiers of Wade\u2019s allied armies had their formations continuously breached and torn through, resulting in them being unable to put up a proper fight. The gap between both sides began to swiftly narrow until Victoria\u2019s forces finally claimed the upper hand for the first time since the clash started.\u201cWe have only managed to disperse their formations thus far. They can still regroup and fight back given sufficient time. We need to hurry up and grasp the decisive victory.\u201dPonte\u2019s attempts to forcefully tap into the power of the labyrinth artifact had taken a huge toll on him, causing his complexion to pale. He anxiously warned his pupil as he tucked the colorful gemstone back into his clothes before drawing a short sword out.This was a short sword that Roel was fairly familiar with: Saint\u2019s Blade\u2014Twelve Wings. However, Ponte had already exhausted himself far too much, such that he ended up needing Victoria\u2019s help to steady the short sword in his grasp.At the center of the battlefield, this teacher and pupil pair exchanged gazes and saw each other\u2019s determination to push it through at any cost. Their intersecting hands moved to point the short sword toward Wade, who was still channeling crimson lightning around him in the distance.In the next instant, a destructive burst of silver light traversed across a thousand meters, illuminating the faces of every single fighting soldier on the battlefield.Spell of Oblivion, Angel\u2019s Chorale.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 - Crown of LightningPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 92: Crown of LightningOne of the reasons why the Twelve Wings were known as holy weapons was because they were believed to possess the power to understand the heart of a human. The abilities they incubate were often in line with the will of their wielders, which, in a sense, could be considered as the fulfillment of wishes.Roel was a weak child, so Ascendwing responded to him by granting him \u2018The Unruly\u2019 ability, allowing him to free himself from dangerous situations. To Ponte, the Twelve Wings chose to grant him greater offensive power instead.Those in the Hextongue Faction were reputed for their exceptional spellcasting speed, bizarre transference spells, and powerful disturbance spells. However, similar to most Scholar Factions in Brolne, it had a fatal flaw\u2014its lacking offensive prowess. He lacked supreme power that could determine a fight.Due to that, Ponte desired greater offensive prowess, and the response given to him by the Twelve Wings was the spell, Angel\u2019s Chorale. This was a powerful spell that focused all of the spellcaster\u2019s mana into a burst of destructive light. There was no questioning its prowess.From the moment of its appearance, all soldiers on the battlefield could vaguely hear a divine hymn sounding in their ears, as if an angel was conveying his blessings through the light. However, to the target of the attack, Wade, it sounded no different than the voice of death.\u201cYour Highness!\u201dFelder was the first one to react in that situation. His loyalty toward his liege compelled him to charge forward fearlessly to shield his liege from this fatal attack despite knowing the consequences that would befall him.Roel\u2019s eyes widened in astonishment at the sight. He never thought Felder, or to be more exact, Bryan, would be the sort of person to actually give up his life for someone else. In his view, Bryan was a cold-hearted individual who prioritized the Elric House above everything else, including his own family. Yet, here he was, like a knight depicted in legends, unhesitatingly laying down his life to protect his liege.As Felder dashed forward, he channeled his mana to its limits, swiftly forming innumerable layers of defensive shields out of his blood mist to fend against the burst of light. However, his defense was insufficient against the destructive might of Angel\u2019s Chorale, which harnessed both the mana of Ponte and Victoria. His blood mist defensive shields were swiftly penetrated layer after layer with frightening speed, faster than the rate that he could generate them.At the final moment, just as the last layer of the blood mist defensive shield was about to be breached, a hand pushed Felder away from the line of attack\u2014Wade.Wade managed to save Felder in the last instant, but the result of that was a direct hit from Angel\u2019s Chorale. The bloodied Felder cried hoarsely in despair, and all soldiers on the battlefield, be it ally or enemy, were shaken by the sight.The duty of a knight was to protect his liege, but how many lieges in the world would be willing to stand forward and sacrifice himself for his knight? Wade\u2019s action was noble yet foolish, and he paid a heavy price for that.Even after being weakened by Felder\u2019s blood mist, Angel\u2019s Chorale was still not a spell which Wade could withstand. His crimson lightning bolts were devoured by the silver light, and his blood and flesh were charred by its destructive energy. It all culminated into a deafening explosion before everything slowly settled.The soldiers, who had finally regained their sight, put aside everything they were doing to look at the fallen prince on the ground.\u201cI-is he dead?\u201d\u201cHave we won?\u201dVictoria\u2019s forces stared at Wade from afar as they sought confirmation from one another in disbelief. Wade\u2019s soldiers shouted in panic, hoping that their liege would open his eyes and tell them that this was not real. Felder was staring at Wade\u2019s body with dilated pupils. Despite his injuries, he dashed forward without a care in the world to ascertain Wade\u2019s current condition. It was almost as if someone had hit the pause button in the middle of the intense battle.Wade Xeclyde had already lost his senses. In truth, he wasn\u2019t thinking anything when he pushed aside Felder from the line of attack. The only thought dominating his mind was that Felder would die at this rate if he did nothing at all.The death of a loved one was something Wade had experienced before, and he never wanted to go through it ever again. That was the reason why he picked up his sword and swore that he would never let history repeat itself. That was the central driving force behind his revolution.Yet, he didn\u2019t think that even after Felder\u2019s blockade, the attack from Ponte and Victoria would still carry sufficient power to kill him. In the face of that blinding light, Wade\u2019s body was punctured with innumerable holes. The hymn of an angel sounded in his ear, as if seeking to send him to heaven. He had lost his senses, and his consciousness began to blur. He felt his body growing lighter and lighter, and it felt like his soul was about to depart from the bustling mortal world.For a moment there, he seemed to have returned back to the sleeping chambers in the royal palace he remembered from his childhood. On a familiar bed, an orange-haired woman hugged him and uttered her expectations for his future.\u201cWade, you are born with great responsibilities. You are the future emperor of the Saint Mesit Theocracy, the envoy of Sia. You\u2019ll uphold justice and fairness in the world. From the icy lands of the borders of the Northern Sea to the dense forests of the South, everyone will be singing praises of your greatness\u2026\u201dHer loving words resounded in his ears, causing Wade\u2019s departing soul to halt in place. As he recalled his mother, a doubt arose in his mind.Have I managed to do it? Have I met my mother\u2019s expectations?As he thought and thought, his dazed eyes regained clarity, and his impassive face was consumed by rage. Silhouette after silhouette flashed across his eyes as he recalled the mocking of the nobles and the discrimination of the clergymen. He remembered the smile on the orange-haired woman\u2019s face as she embraced him, telling him that they would reunite on the day he was crowned as emperor.That was a promise that was never fulfilled, as well as the final piece of memory he had of her. His recollection froze right at that scene, and it silently whispered the answer to his doubts.No, I can\u2019t leave right now. I haven\u2019t achieved my goals yet.Wade\u2019s eyes fully regained their clarity, and the angelic hymn no longer reached him anymore. Flaring pain returned to his body as mana began flooding his body at a ridiculous level. The glow of the Wrath Origin Attribute resurfaced as his answer to the irrationality of this world. His eyes shot open once more as he sought to purge the irrationality that brought about his mother\u2019s death. His body was tattered, but his existence had never been felt so strongly on the battlefield before.\u201cMother, please bear witness to the path I seek,\u201d whispered Wade softly to himself.A beautiful figure seemed to appear before his eyes. She smiled at him, encouraging him to advance bravely.The lightning bolts in the sky began crackling once more, and a storm flurried furiously across the battlefield. Standing at the center of this frightening phenomenon, Wade looked far larger than he was. His crimson mana rose like flames into the sky, forming a ruby crown on his head.This turn of events astonished Victoria and the others.\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d\u201cWade\u2026\u201dRight before everyone\u2019s eyes, Wade successfully made a breakthrough. His fury overcame the limitations of life and death, bringing his Wrath Origin Attribute to a greater height, becoming an Origin Level 2 transcendent. His powerful mana shook the Holy Capital, roaring for those who had died of injustice. There was no one in this huge Theocracy who could stop him anymore.The injured prince raised his sword up to the sky as he announced to the world that he had returned. At the same time, fragments of his mana drifted across the battlefield and fell upon his soldiers, warping into crimson light that shrouded their bodies. All of Wade\u2019s soldiers roared in excitement as they felt their overall stats rising. Their exhausted bodies were reinvigorated, and it felt like there was a flame blazing in their chests.\u201cBrave warriors, follow me! We shall build an impartial world for all!\u201dWade\u2019s words served as the war horns to announce the commencement of a new round of battle, and his rally was responded to with loud cheers from his soldiers too. The buffed allied armies of Wade raised their swords and charged forth with unstoppable might, forcing Victoria\u2019s forces into a defensive position.Far away, Victoria looked at her severely injured brother who was now born anew. There was a dazed expression on her face. From the moment he successfully made a breakthrough, she knew that things weren\u2019t going to go smoothly.Origin Level 2.This was already beyond what Victoria and Ponte could deal with. Other than Holy Eminence Ryan, there was no one in the entire Saint Mesit Theocracy who could suppress Wade in terms of power anymore. However, this didn\u2019t mean that it was the end yet. They still stood a chance, for Wade was simply too severely injured.Wade\u2019s breakthrough did little to heal him from the fatal injury he had suffered, and Felder was severely weakened too. The two of them were at their limits. Wade\u2019s unbelievable army-level buff was indeed powerful, but such spells tended to last for only a short duration and had extreme side effects afterward.In other words, as long as they could survive this onslaught, there was a good chance that they could turn things around and win this battle! This was really the final battle of this war, and they needed to hold on regardless of the cost.\u201cHold your ground, their spells cannot last for too long!\u201d\u201cReinforce the defense line!\u201dSuch shouts echoed loudly among Victoria\u2019s forces. Ponte even stood at the frontline to organize the formations personally.On the other hand, however, Felder was personally leading the charge of Wade\u2019s allied armies, emanating his trademark crimson glow along with him. He, too, knew that this was the critical moment of the war, so he forsook his shield and focused solely on offense. Behind him, the severely injured Wade was also casting lightning and flames on enemy soldiers. This liege-subordinate pair were already on the verge of death, but ironically, they appeared to be in their strongest condition yet.Under Felder\u2019s fearless charge, a gaping hole was pierced into the formation of Victoria\u2019s forces. Wade\u2019s allied armies charged right through Victoria\u2019s soldiers, heading right into the heart of their formation. They couldn\u2019t care less about the soldiers threatening their flanks anymore; their targets were clear\u2014Victoria and Ponte.On the battlefield, the familiar group of four reunited with one another once more, but the circumstances were different from before. Wade\u2019s lightning was no longer something that Ponte\u2019s comparatively weaker spells could dispel easily, and Victoria\u2019s abilities were mainly centered around support, so she was unable to pose a threat directly. The ability of their Twelve Wings sword was still on cooldown, resulting in the teacher-pupil duo being unable to launch any decisive attacks against their enemies.The area of their clash was soon devastated as sand and rubble shot in all directions. Explosions blasted off one after another.The first one to fall amongst the four was Felder. He had been the one leading the charge earlier, resulting in him exhausting himself significantly. Victoria\u2019s holy light area spell had struck him squarely, causing him to finally succumb to his injuries and collapse to the ground.However, in return for that, Ponte and Victoria, who were already lacking in mana, suffered direct hits from Wade\u2019s lightning, causing them to incur significant injuries. Ponte coughed a mouthful of blood whereas Victoria\u2019s light wings gradually began to dissipate.In the end, the two of them slumped to the ground while leaning on one another. Lightning rumbled in the air as a countdown to the end of the duo\u2019s life started ticking.But, all of a sudden, a divine ray of light suddenly shrouded the teacher-pupil duo as a small figure stepped forth to protect them\u2014Nora. She descended from the sky with her light wings, and before the shocked eyes of the duo, she activated one of her magic tools successfully blocking the onslaught of lightning bolts from Wade.However, this was already her limit. The protective barrier she summoned was severely strained under Wade\u2019s earlier attack, and it wouldn\u2019t last another direct attack from him. Once it shattered, she would have no other means to stop Wade anymore.Wade was momentarily surprised to see his lightning bolts blocked before an impassive look returned to his face. He shot a look at Nora, and he could clearly tell the side she had chosen from the look in her eyes.\u201cYou would rather die together with them? Very well, I understand,\u201d muttered Wade.He raised his sword to end this war that had continued for far too long, but all of a sudden, he felt a menacing threat coming from behind and halted his movement. He instinctively deemed this threat to be far beyond what Ponte, Victoria, and Nora posed to him right now, so he turned around and quickly scanned the battlefield.In the end, his gaze fell upon a single silhouette that was walking his way. It was the black-haired boy he had seen not long ago.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 - My AnswerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 93: My AnswerRoel didn\u2019t stop Nora from charging forward to protect Ponte and Victoria because he knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop her, and he knew that there was something else he needed to do too.He had been watching the war for several hours up till now, and that had given him plenty of time to think over everything. The fact that he finally chose to step onto the battlefield meant that he had finally made his choice, and he had the means to turn what he wished to see into reality.\u3010Spell \u2018Grandar\u2019s Promise\u2019 has been activated.\u3011\u3010Countdown. 30\u2026 29\u2026 28\u2026\u3011This was the third time he was activating this spell, but unlike the previous two times, there was no explosion of strength and mana. The scenery around him changed, and before he knew it, he was no longer on the battlefield anymore. The stench of blood that had been lingering in his nose slowly scattered as he found himself standing in the middle of a red plain, and the humongous skeleton, Grandar, was standing before him.\u201cHave you finally thought through your answer?\u201dGrandar gazed down at Roel with mild interest in his eyes as he spoke gravely.\u201cAnswer me. How do the dead pass down their power?\u201dRoel was silent for a moment after hearing Grandar\u2019s question once more. He thought of all of the details he had gathered from his interactions with Grandar thus far before finally speaking.\u201cI have prepared two answers. One of them is for this question; the other one is for you. Which one would you like to hear?\u201d\u201cOh? Interesting. Tell me both.\u201d\u201cFor the first answer, in regards to your question, as someone who has been watching this war together with me, you should already know my answer, isn\u2019t that so?\u201dRoel looked at the faraway setting sun that seemed ready to dip below the horizon, within could be seen the figures of the brave warriors fighting against one another. The faces of Victoria and Wade appeared in front of his eyes before scattering away with the wind.\u201cSpirit, will, and ideals. These are the ways that the dead pass down their power. Some do it through writing history; some do it through the transference of knowledge. As these legacies accumulate with each passing generation, eventually bringing forth a qualitative change. That\u2019s how the society and civilization we know now came to be.\u201dRoel thought of the rich culture of the countries that were built in his previous life, as he affirmed his views.\u201cThe foundation of all cultures and civilizations is the dead, or to be more exact, the knowledge they have passed down. This knowledge may change, be trimmed, or be further expanded over time, but without a doubt, this accumulation over time will bring each passing generation to greater heights. It\u2019s the string that ties all beings, living or dead, together.\u201dRoel\u2019s response left Grandar deep in thought. Grandar didn\u2019t give his response right away, but unexpectedly, Roel wasn\u2019t done yet.\u201cBut, none of what I have just said is applicable to you.\u201dThose words made Grandar gradually open his mouth as the light in his eyes grew greater. If skeletons could show a stupefied expression, that would probably be it. However, Roel didn\u2019t pay any heed to it.\u201cAll that I have just said is under the premise that one has successors to inherit one\u2019s lineage. What about you though? You don\u2019t have that anymore, am I right?\u201dRoel shot a glance at the massive skeletal racks half-buried in the sand and sighed quietly.\u201cThe giants are only faraway legends of the Second Epoch now. I don\u2019t know if your civilization still exists, but your spirit, will, and even your existence have already disappeared into the oblivion of history. The first answer I prepared is no longer applicable to you, and that\u2019s why I have another answer just for you.\u201dBefore Grandar\u2019s shocked eyes, Roel unhesitatingly pointed to himself in confidence\u2014or perhaps, it might be more accurate to call it arrogance.\u201cI am your answer, Grandar.\u201dRoel looked at the imposing giant skeleton calmly, as if everything was under his control.\u201cI am your medium for passing down your power through the generations once more, be it your spirit, will, civilization, history, or even strength. I am not an important person in this world, but I am necessary to you. This is the answer I have to your question.\u201d\u201cHahaha! Brat, you sure have guts to dare speak those words. Are you threatening me?\u201d\u201cIt only further shows that I\u2019m right if you feel threatened by my words\u2026 And besides, you don\u2019t dislike me, right? Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t have helped me so much.\u201dRoel spoke with a bright smile. Grandar\u2019s spell had helped him overcome danger on several occasions, and the other party had even specially met him the second time he used the spell to remind him to give him an answer. This massive skeleton was indeed a frightening existence, but there was no denying that the other party had been helping him all this while.\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re more brazen than I thought, but that\u2019s also why I favor you.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, Grandar burst into hearty laughter. His voice trembled the plain, causing the dust on his body to rain down.\u201cYour first answer is already acceptable, but the second answer you offered fits my palate better. Let me ask you another question then.\u201dThe skeleton turned solemn once more. He gazed down at the young boy who dared to face him fearlessly and asked.\u201cLad, no, Roel Ascart, what do you think the relationship between the two of us should be?\u201d\u201cI personally am interested in befriending you.\u201d\u201cFriends? Haha, I see! Very well!\u201dGrandar stood up as dust fell from his tattered cape. His towering stature made him appear no different than a god standing beneath the afterglow of the setting sun.\u201cThen I shall help my friend achieve victory on the battlefield!\u201d\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s you\u2026\u201dWade finally snapped out of his astonishment. It was the same black-haired boy he had seen before, but he was different from before. The air the boy gave off felt unfathomable, almost as if he was staring into the abyss. Concentrated mana that didn\u2019t pale in comparison to his, an Origin Level 2 transcendent, pulsated around the boy\u2019s body.\u201cIs he a Blessed One of the ancient gods? I never thought that I would encounter such an existence here.\u201dBlessed Ones referred to individuals who were bestowed with extraordinary powers by the ancient gods. Despite the word \u2018blessed\u2019, in truth, they were just toys for the ancient gods. Some of them didn\u2019t even have their own will, and nearly all of them met with tragic ends.Wade thought Roel was one of those pitiful Blessed Ones, but he had no intention of going easy on someone who threatened him. He unhesitatingly channeled his crimson lightning bolts toward Roel, hoping to end this battle quickly.While it was easy to assume that Blessed Ones were powerful existences, the truth was not so. The ancient gods behind them didn\u2019t value the Blessed Ones so much as to protect them. After all, broken toys can always be replaced with a new one; it was foolish to fight with others over mere consumables.Crimson lightning bombarded Roel, dyeing the land red. The sheer intensity of the lightning made the air feel searing hot. The shouts coming from Nora and the others were silenced by the thunderous rumbling. The eyes of the soldiers were being drawn over as many believed that the curtains were finally going to be drawn on this internal strife.After striking down Roel, Wade confidently turned back to face Victoria and the others, wanting to end this once for all. But unexpectedly, the boy who was expected to die didn\u2019t fall.\u201cGrandar.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201dRoel called for his comrade, and a humongous silhouette suddenly descended in the middle of the Holy Capital. It was a skeleton so enormous that he seemed to connect the earth to heaven. Wade\u2019s devastating crimson lightning looked like nothing more than tiny snakes in his face. With a wave of his hand, a powerful gust of wind blew and dissipated the crimson lightning into nothing.Feeling the gust of wind rushing past him, Wade hurriedly turned around, only to be shocked by what he saw. Things had proceeded in a direction far beyond his imagination. He stared at Roel, who stood at the center of Grandar\u2019s protection, and fear struck him.The boy isn\u2019t a Blessed One but a Contractor of an ancient god.The realization of this unbelievable fact made Wade realize how huge of a threat he was facing at this moment. He immediately gathered all of his mana, and the Wrath Origin Attribute bellowed furiously within his body.The crimson lightning in the sky vanished without a trace, replaced by a silent sphere of light in his hands. This sphere was the manifestation of his wrath, the silent fury he bore against the world. It was so bright that it dulled everything in its surroundings. This was the highest destructive power of the Wrath Origin Attribute.On the other end, Roel had also finished his preparations too.\u201cGiven your circumstances, I can only exert a single punch at most,\u201d echoed Grandar\u2019s voice in Roel\u2019s ears.Even under the effects of undead reanimation, Roel\u2019s body was still swiftly being torn apart. His body was unable to bear the weight of the giant\u2019s strength. But, so what?Roel didn\u2019t respond to the giant\u2019s words right away, choosing instead to turn to Nora, who was protected within a magic barrier at the moment. A slight smile formed on his lips as he spoke.\u201cI wish to bring her out of here safely, no matter what it takes. Is one punch enough?\u201d Roel asked Grandar.Grandar responded with a hearty laugh that was filled with lofty pride as one of the strongest existences in the world.\u201cOne punch? That\u2019s more than enough!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do it then!\u201dAmidst hearty laughter, Roel\u2019s billowing mana began to take a corporeal form. Circular ribcage bones that emanated blood-colored light formed around Roel, followed by the neck, and head. Like a demon god summoned from hell, Grandar\u2019s upper body was beginning to manifest in this world.The sight caused soldiers to feel giddy, and even the bravest of warriors didn\u2019t dare to look at it in the eyes.Before the sphere of light that threatened to bring forth destruction, Grandar unhesitatingly raised his massive arms to strike down on it.Boom!A powerful shockwave swept through the entire Holy Capital like a major earthquake had been triggered. The terrifying sphere of light, formed with the concentrated prowess of the Wrath Origin Attribute, shattered under the might of Grandar\u2019s fist.At this very moment, Wade seemed to see countless giants standing amidst a scarlet plain in front of him, and their crowned king was roaring furiously at him.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dWade exclaimed in astonishment, but his voice was immediately drowned out by the explosion. The shockwave sent the soldiers flying through the air helplessly. Even Nora\u2019s magic tool had begun cracking under the impact, causing the barrier she had summoned to protect the three of them to waver unstably.However, Nora couldn\u2019t care less about all of this at the moment. She looked around anxiously in search of Roel\u2019s silhouette.\u201cChild, he\u2019ll be fine. You need to protect yourself first!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dNora knew that Victoria was right, and it made her feel deeply helpless. She shouted Roel\u2019s name desperately as she hurriedly tried to sustain the barrier as long as possible to shield them from the impact of the shockwave.Meanwhile, the severely injured Felder was struck squarely by the shockwave and fell unconscious, resulting in him being blown away along with the other soldiers who were dragging him out of the battlefield.This single collision literally shook the entire Holy Capital, and the intense battle finally came to an end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - Are You Certain About Choosing Him?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94: Are You Certain About Choosing Him?The terrain within the labyrinth underwent a complete change. Houses collapsed, and the soldiers of both factions toppled to the ground. This entire region was flattened.Roel and Wade\u2019s clash created a force far beyond imagination. A huge cloud of dust rose into the sky like a soaring dragon, and it took a long while before everything finally settled down.There was only one person left standing at the center of the explosion, and it was a black-haired boy. He set his eyes on the collapsed Wade before staggering over with his strained body.Without a doubt, Wade had lost in the collision of power. Due to Roel\u2019s weak body, Grandar had only exerted enough strength to nullify Wade\u2019s spell, but this was more than enough to achieve victory. Wade was simply too severely injured by the earlier attack from Ponte and Victoria that he couldn\u2019t sustain himself anymore after losing almost all of his mana.\u201cI don\u2019t understand. You are a heretic. Why do you stand in my way?\u201dWade was weakened to the extent that he couldn\u2019t even rise to his feet anymore. From the moment he expended his vitality to force a breakthrough to Origin Level 2, it had already become a battle against time for him to defeat Victoria and Ponte before his body caved in. Strictly speaking, he had lost not to Roel but to himself.Knowing this, Roel didn\u2019t put on the attitude of a victor before Wade.He dragged his fatigued body over to Wade\u2019s side, and he looked at the latter with eyes filled, not with scorn, but respect. He pondered Wade\u2019s question before slowly giving his reply.\u201cThere are many reasons. For one, rather than stirring up a huge war of unification, I believe it\u2019s more worthwhile to devote our resources to improving the lives of the populace instead. But, if I really have to choose one\u2026 if I were to give you an opportunity to raise your arms to protect your loved ones, would you grasp it?\u201d said Roel as he glanced at a golden-haired girl running toward him.It was Nora, who had overcome the shockwave through her magic tool. She heard Roel\u2019s words on her way over, and her footsteps suddenly came to a halt. Wade happened to glance over at this moment, and the two of them met each other\u2019s eyes.\u201cI see. It looks like we\u2019re the same type of people\u2026\u201dWade stared into the boundless sky as the image of his mother, Consort Mary, flashed before his eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s just that I was unable to raise my arms when my loved one was in danger. When I was finally ready to protect her, she was already no longer around.\u201dListening to Wade\u2019s remark, Roel suddenly felt a little conflicted on the inside. Wade was someone who had devoted his life to erasing the tragedy he had once suffered. He rose to fight for the heretics, raising a revolution to bring them a brighter future. Yet, at the same time, he brought suffering and death to many innocents. Roel couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he would have walked down the same path had he been in Wade\u2019s shoes.There was a long moment of silence between them before Roel finally spoke up.\u201cYou might have failed in your revolution, but you were still a worthy emperor for your people.\u201d\u201cOh? And you still turned against me?\u201d\u201cI recognize your talents and your spirit, but I oppose your goal and your ambitions.\u201d\u201cIs that so? What a traitorous subject you are. Young lass, it looks like you\u2019ll suffer quite a bit in the future.\u201dThere was an indistinct smile on Wade\u2019s lips as he watched Nora walking over to Roel\u2019s side to support him. His words seemed to carry a deeper meaning, and it left Nora at a loss as to how she should respond.Looking at these two young children, Wade suddenly felt the wrath that had been burning within him ever since Mary\u2019s death slowly coming to a rest.Maybe these two children will lead the Theocracy to a better place than I ever could? If this boy\u2019s strength were to be paired with the Xeclydes\u2019 unique abilities\u2026As such thoughts crossed Wade\u2019s mind, his expression gradually eased up, as if he had let go of all of the baggage weighing him down. Under Nora and Roel\u2019s watch, he closed his eyes for the final time.\u3010The goals of the Witness State have been fulfilled. Remaining time left: 4 hours 2 minutes\u3011\u3010Evaluation: Perfect (102)\u3011\u201cRoel, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dAs soon as Roel saw the word \u2018Perfect\u2019 reflected in the System, his body finally reached its limit. He wobbled unsteadily on his feet, and he would have fallen to the ground if not for Nora noticing it in time and supporting him.\u201cIt\u2019s noth\u2026 Alright, it\u2019s something. I don\u2019t have the strength to continue standing anymore.\u201dRoel was barely standing, he felt completely expended. The only thing keeping him upright was his arm flung over Nora\u2019s shoulders. Truthfully, he could barely feel anything in his body at all. The aftereffects of tapping into Grandar\u2019s overwhelming strength had taken a huge strain on his body, such that his consciousness had started blurring. He even wondered if he would pass away like Wade as soon as he closed his eyes.Breathing in the scent of Nora\u2019s body, Roel tried his best to pull himself together. He took a look at the latest notification coming from the System.\u3010Remaining time left: 4 minutes 42 seconds\u3011Roel heaved a sigh of relief. The time had updated. After three days of heart-thumping danger, the two of them were finally going to leave this place alive. His eyes turned a little moist just thinking about it.One must know that Roel lived a privileged life of luxury prior to coming to this place. Dealing with a couple of kids was already his limit. To suddenly be put through such a trial was honestly far too much of a leap ahead. Nevertheless, in order to protect Nora and awaken his bloodline, he had no choice but to grit his teeth and persevere through crisis after crisis.After all his effort, he was finally going to leave this place in 4 minutes\u2019 time. There probably wasn\u2019t enough time to say farewell to Ponte and the others, though it was likely that he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it anyway with the restrictions on speech here.With such thoughts in mind, Roel began sharing the news with Nora.\u201cNora, we\u2019ll be leaving\u2026\u201d\u201cAre the two of you fine?\u201dIt was then that Ponte and Victoria arrived at the scene too, interrupting Roel\u2019s words. Victoria swiftly noticed that Wade had stopped moving altogether and froze on the spot. Tears formed in her eyes, and she began to weep silently over the death of her younger twin brother. Ponte moved forward to console her.Victoria knew that this wasn\u2019t a good time and place to be grieving over Wade\u2019s death, so she quickly pulled herself back together and turned to Roel to ask for Wade\u2019s dying words. However, when she saw the state that Roel was in, she jolted in astonishment.\u201cWhat happened? His body has undergone undead reanimation?\u201dVictoria took a closer look at Roel\u2019s physical state before remarking with widened eyes. Ponte also quickly examined Roel\u2019s condition and frowned.\u201cHow did things turn out like that? Could it be the price demanded by an ancient god?\u201d\u201cUndead reanimation? Ancient god?\u201dLooking at the anxious faces of his two predecessors, Roel implicitly understood that they were referring to Grandar. His body had lost all feeling after that powerful straight jab pulled off by the giant. Most likely, his joints and nerves must have been severely damaged by having to exert a force beyond what they could withstand. The realization of just how terrible a state he was in made his cheeks twitch a little.However, before he could make a fuss about the condition he was in, someone else was already doing it for him.\u201cWe don\u2019t have any mana left\u2026 Quick, Nora! You should be the one to do it!\u201d\u201cAh? I\u2019m afraid that I don\u2019t have any spells that aid in recovery.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant. Don\u2019t you have one of the Twelve Wings weapons with you?\u201dVictoria shot a glance at the short sword hanging by Roel\u2019s waist and quickly drew it out. She stuffed it into Nora\u2019s hands and urged.\u201cUse this!\u201d\u201cUse\u2026 this?\u201dFacing the dumbstruck Roel and Nora, it finally dawned on Victoria that these two children were oblivious to the many uses of the Twelve Wings series. Heaving a deep sigh, she began explaining to them.\u201cYour mana fused together during the unsealing of the blade, which resulted in the incubation of an ability within it. So, by using it as a medium, it\u2019s possible for you to transfer mana to one another to some extent, be it through an exchange of blood or intimate contact.\u201dRoel was still initially nodding in agreement with Victoria\u2019s words, but the last few phrases that she mentioned nearly made his eyes bulge out.Wait a moment. Exchange of blood? Intimate contact?!He was getting a very bad feeling about this, and he really wanted Victoria to stop speaking. However, Victoria paid no heed to his silent plea whatsoever and continued \u2018imparting knowledge\u2019 to Nora.\u201cHe can\u2019t afford to lose any more blood, or else his condition will worsen. You\u2019ll have to sacrifice yourself in order to save him!\u201dThe opportunistic Victoria instinctively knew that this was a good chance to play the wingman and help her \u2018little sister\u2019 score a homerun. If things go well, it would be killing two birds in one stone\u2026No\u2014Victoria shot a glance at Ponte\u2014it would be three birds in one stone\u2026So, she looked at Nora intently and threw a discreet straight ball right over.\u201cNora, are you certain that you have chosen him? You won\u2019t regret this?\u201dVictoria\u2019s words were a secret message known only by the Xeclydes. As descendants of angels, the Xeclydes valued purity very highly. Every Xeclyde, be it man or woman, could only have a single companion for life. Regardless of how lacking they were in offspring, the virtue of purity took precedence over everything else.Nora quickly understood Victoria\u2019s intentions. Her sapphire eyes widened as her face reddened in embarrassment. Roel sharply noticed that there was something wrong with the atmosphere, so he quickly interjected.\u201cIf I may ask, what are the two of you talking\u2026\u201d\u201cRoel, my apologies, but I\u2019ll have to ask you to hold your tongue for now.\u201dRoel: \u201c???\u201dIn a rare show of blatant dominance, Nora silenced Roel with a sharp tone. Meanwhile, Ponte understood what Victoria was driving at, and he looked at the two children before him doubtfully, wondering if they were still too young to make such a decision.\u201cVictoria, don\u2019t you think that\u2026\u201d\u201cTeacher, you should stay out of this.\u201dPonte: \u201c???\u201dThe two princesses of the Xeclydes displayed their dominant personalities, leaving the two subdued Ascart boys looking at one another. They suddenly realized just how low of a standing they seemed to have before these two women.\u201cNora, if you have already made up your mind, go ahead and do what you have to. Don\u2019t end up like me. Even though I won\u2019t let him get away, things aren\u2019t that easy for me anymore.\u201dVictoria shared the lessons she had learned from her personal experiences, and Nora nodded in agreement too. The Ascart boys had an incredibly frustrating tendency to reach out to them but not do anything at all. Yet, when they tried to approach them, they would back away out of fear. With such thoughts in mind, Nora\u2019s eyes became firm.\u201cI understand.\u201dNora responded to Victoria with affirmation before she turned her eyes toward the confused boy beside her.No, wait a moment. What do you understand?Roel was still bewildered by the current turn of events. These two girls seemed to be speaking in riddles that he couldn\u2019t understand. But, for some reason, he felt that there was something dangerous in the gaze Nora was directing toward him. It was a predatory gaze, yet it carried a hint of tenderness and warmth too. In any case, it was just weird!\u201cSince you have made up your mind, I wish you all the best!\u201dVictoria struck Nora\u2019s back in encouragement as a burst of green light rose from her head. Before the dumbstruck Roel could react, Nora had already supported his body upward and sealed his lips.\u201cWuu!\u201dRoel couldn\u2019t even begin to wrap his head around what was happening.

People slowly gathered around these campfires and chattered merrily.This New Year Hunt was decided on a whim, but as the powerful transcendent, Carter Ascart, was with them, they hardly faced any danger along the way.Last night, they set off from the royal palace and arrived at a village located at the foot of the mountain. From the villagers, they learned that there was a strange, massive bird that spat venom terrorizing the mountain. This had resulted in the other animals being chased out of the area.Needless to say, this was good news for the hunting team, who were looking for a worthy prey to subjugate. The following morning, they ventured into the depths of the mountain under Prince Kane and Marquess Carter\u2019s lead, and by noon, they had already managed to kill the bird. They found quite a few eggs in the bird\u2019s nest and had them shipped back to the Holy Capital.They spent the time afterward dissecting the bird, removing its feathers, skin, meat, and even its poison sac\u2014which they were planning to use as the medium for a spell\u2014before finally incinerating its carcass with a torch. It was a massive victory, especially given that they had protected the livelihoods of the villagers in the region too. Naturally, this was a huge cause for celebration, and the atmosphere was livelier than ever.However, in the corner was a gloomy little silver-haired girl, that dampened the atmosphere a little.Alicia wasn\u2019t in a good mood at all. Her beautiful eyebrows were slightly curved downward, and her large eyes reflected her worry and frustration. It was an expression that could easily invoke the sympathy of anyone around her.She might be stuck on this mountain, but her heart was far away in the Holy Capital. In truth, she should have attended the royal banquet together with Roel, and this New Year Hunt should have become a treasured memory between the two of them. Yet, of all times, Roel happened to receive an invitation from the Holy Eminence, resulting in the two of them parting ways.It was already depressing enough that she was unable to spend the new year with her beloved older brother, but who could have thought that Kane and the others would actually send Nora into the Labyrinth Villa during her absence? That was no different than rubbing salt in her wound!Alicia didn\u2019t hate Nora; on the contrary, she very much admired the princess. Nora\u2019s charisma as the princess of the Theocracy was the real deal. Her powerful and graceful presence inspired others to follow and serve her. Had it not been for Roel, she might have chosen to serve Nora as her liege. Unfortunately, fate had other plans in store\u2026Her meeting with Roel was like a withered flower encountering morning dew. Even if there was other water in the world that could make her blossom even more beautifully, she wouldn\u2019t choose anything else over it anymore. She had already decided that the morning dew was all she needed.Yet, who could have thought that her warm and kind older brother would actually catch the eye of Her Highness Nora? To make things worse, the two of them were actually living under the same roof at this very instant!This is dangerous! Big brother Roel, you must keep your distance from her!Warning bells were ringing in Alicia\u2019s head, making her feel deeply uneasy. However, there was nothing she could do. It would be unreasonable of her to ask Carter to send her back right now, so she could only sit on a log, munch on the freshly roasted bird meat, and watch those uncles merrymaking together.The night deepened, but the exuberant adults were still singing and dancing joyfully around the campfires. For a child like Alicia, however, it was about time to sleep. The maids had already prepared the tent and noise isolation magic tools so that Alicia could have a good rest.Such consideration was the initiative of Anna, the newly promoted head maid, as well as the manager of the Roel X Alicia Ship fanclub. She viewed it as her personal responsibility to ensure the comfort of the future matriarch of the Ascart House.Anna quietly reminded Alicia that it was time for her to retire for the night, and the two of them began making their way over to the tent. Unexpectedly, along the way, they heard Marquess Carter\u2019s astonished exclamation.\u201cWhat? There has been an emergency in the Labyrinth Villa?\u201d\u2026Bishop Philip had just encountered a small problem in his life.Dressed in white holy robes with reinforced chainmail underneath and armed with a magic staff, he was currently standing in the study of the Labyrinth Villa, looking stiffly at two children cuddling one another right before his eyes.The good news was that these two children were the targets that he was supposed to rescue from the clutches of evil cultists, Roel Ascart and Nora Xeclyde. It should have been gladdening for Philip to see that they were safe and sound, but the problem lay in the manner of their appearance\u2014they had literally appeared out of nowhere. There was a sudden burst of light, and these two suddenly popped into the room.In truth, Philip had the scare of his life when he received the orders from Holy Eminence John to rescue the precious little princess of the royal family. One must know that Nora was the treasure of the Theocracy, and any threat to her life was a national crisis!Without daring to hesitate in the least, he rallied 100 veteran inquisitors from the Holy Palace. They mounted their steeds and galloped straight to the Ascart House\u2019s Labyrinth Villa. When Philip informed the guards stationed at the Labyrinth Villa that Roel and Nora were in danger, all of them were a little skeptical, though none of them dared to make light of the situation.It was all chaos afterward.A terrifying force consisting of a bishop, high-level inquisitors, royal guards, and the personal guards of the Ascarts sprinted frenziedly toward the study with anxious faces, causing the maid stationed outside the room, Mia, to nearly shriek in horror.The door was pushed open, and the panting men and women were stupefied to see that the room was completely empty. There was not a single soul to be found. The heavy silence that loomed was panic inducing.The commander of the Ascart House\u2019s private army immediately contacted Marquess Carter to inform him of the situation. The head of the royal guards did the same too, but his recipient was Prince Kane. Philip stared at the scene with his mouth agape as he wondered if the Holy Eminence had gone senile with old age and relayed the wrong location to him.Then, in the middle of all the chaos, an explosion of light suddenly occurred in the study.Everyone present were skilled fighters with sharp senses, and their first reaction was that they had come under attack.Schwing schwing schwing schwing!Even without a command, all of the guards reflexively unsheathed their swords. They observed the scene warily.\u201cWho is it? Where\u2019s the enemy?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWait a moment, there are people inside the light!\u201d\u201cI-it\u2019s Her Highness!\u201dAnd, this was how Philip found himself in his present circumstances.However, this was no time for a recap. How Roel and Nora appeared was, surprisingly, only a secondary concern. He had noticed another, even more explosive, fact that made his eyelids twitch uncontrollably.Even though Philip had been single for over 40 years now, his tingling senses as an adult were telling him that there was a problem with just how unnaturally close the lips of the two embracing, unconscious children were. If his guess was not wrong, it would mean that the hope of the Theocracy, their beloved Princess Nora, before being knocked out, was actually locking lips with this darned brat from the Ascart House!A-and judging from their posture\u2026 it is a forceful kiss even!Philip was utterly dumbfounded. There was not a single day in his 40 years of singlehood that had equipped him with the wisdom to deal with a situation like this. Furthermore\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t touch them! The two of them are currently linked by some sort of spell!\u201dPhilip anxiously shouted at the guards who were rushing up to the two children out of agitation. His keen eyes had already given him a rough understanding of the current situation. He noticed the presence of the silver short sword hanging by Roel\u2019s waist.\u201cThis is the ability of the Saint\u2019s Blade\u2014Twelve Wings. Don\u2019t touch them yet. It\u2019s likely that one of them is injured at the moment, and the other is channeling mana to heal the injuries. The two of them are safe right now, but the same cannot be said if any of us were to move them recklessly.\u201dPhilip looked at the dirty faces of the two children, but he was unable to discern who was the one injured here. As an ex-member of the Inquisitor Hall, his offensive capability as a transcendent was not to be underestimated. However, treating the wounded would be going beyond his field of specialty. He dared not make a call on this matter recklessly.So, Philip passed down an order to bring a transcendent with the relevant ability over to check on their condition.\u201cCall the clergymen from the Sacramental Hall over!\u201dOne of Philip\u2019s subordinates immediately contacted the church for reinforcement.Meanwhile, in a study filled with people of varying statuses, be it the high and lofty bishops and military commanders or the humble servants and maids, everyone was staring at one another uncomfortably, not knowing what to do. Their passion for gossip had been ignited after seeing the postures of the boy and the girl embracing one another on the carpet.To be fair, it was nothing much for children of their age to embrace one another, but the nature of the matter changed if a kiss was involved too.It was normal for people of the Sia Continent to marry at 14 or 15, so it was also commonplace for children of 12 or 13 years of age to be engaged with one another. But 10 years old\u2026 wasn\u2019t this a little too early?One must know that the Xeclydes were known for only having one companion their entire life. From the current looks of it, it would appear that their princess already had someone in her heart, and it was none other than the successor of the Ascart House. Everything had happened so suddenly that they weren\u2019t sure what to make of this news.\u201cMiss Mia, should we bring something\u2026 Ah? M-Miss Mia?\u201dPhilip was intending to ask Mia to bring something over to cover the two children, so as to uphold their privacy, but to his surprise, the maid actually began crying.???W-What\u2019s going on?The princess is fine, so why are you crying?Philip couldn\u2019t have imagined that he was witnessing the birth of a new fanclub manager. Meanwhile, Mia had no attention to spare to bother with how outsiders might view her at the moment. She was simply too absorbed in her excitement.How many years has our princess been alone? Finally, Her Highness has found her own happiness!Mia bit on her handkerchief in agitation as tears streamed down her face.The flabbergasted Philip moved his gaze to and fro between the two embracing children and Mia several times, but he couldn\u2019t see anything to weep over about this situation.Ah, I guess she must be shocked.After squeezing out a reason to make sense out of the situation, Philip heaved a deep sigh before creating a golden wall around the two children with a wave of his hand. Then, he clapped his hands to gather everyone\u2019s attention and spoke.\u201cEveryone. There\u2019s no point for all of us to wait here for the clergy of the Sacramental Hall to arrive. You should return back to your stations and do what you have to. The night isn\u2019t over yet!\u201dPhilip\u2019s words jolted everyone awake, and the guards quickly left to return back to their duty stations. They had already realized that this would not be a peaceful night, and their hearts hadn\u2019t calmed down from the earlier shock of Roel and Nora\u2019s disappearance. They couldn\u2019t allow anything else to happen beyond this.As for those from the church, they knew a little more about the incident. Their peers in the Inquisitor Hall were currently working overtime chasing evil cultists all around with greatswords in their hands. It was the first worthy mission they had had here at Holy Capital Loren in many years.To be honest, they were rather happy about this mission too.The Inquisitor Hall was basically a reserve army receiving wages from the Genesis Goddess Church. Their missions were usually very dangerous, requiring them to travel all the way to remote villages or mountain valleys in order to strike down evil cultists.However, the enemies they were dealing with this time were right here in Loren, their very home base. They had convenient access to supplies, and medical aid was on tap, just a call away. This mission was much safer than what they usually took on.Most importantly of all, they could earn a bonus for each evil cultist they managed to strike down, and working overtime during public holidays entitled them to double pay. Needless to say, they welcomed such easy money with open arms!Who wouldn\u2019t love money?Actually, Philip wasn\u2019t too surprised this incident happened over the new year. The evil cultists on the Sia Continent were very powerful, but they had to pay a heavy price for their strength. One of the more common conditions required the evil cultists to offer tributes on festive occasions, such as the new year.Due to the powerful influence of the church in the Theocracy, hardly any evil cultist would dare to pull off anything here. However, if one were to investigate the reports of missing people in other countries, one would notice that the number of missing people reported tended to spike during the new year period.In fact, in more chaotic locations, the new year period was even viewed as a calamity. Innocent civilians were forced to hide in the mountains out of fear, choosing to bear with the coldness and hunger in the wilderness rather than spend the new year in their own villages. Evil cults would surely strike during this period of time, and weaker villages didn\u2019t stand a chance against them at all.Recalling the tragedies he had witnessed when taking on missions outside, Philip closed his eyes and prayed that those who lived in fear could remain safe this year.It was then that a communicator of the Ascart House, a transcendent skilled in communication spells, suddenly entered the room.\u201cBishop, I am Carter Ascart. I wish to see my son\u2019s condition!\u201d\u201cBig brother Roel!\u201d\u201cMarquess Carter, you may call me Philip. Your son is safe, so I ask you not to worry. Ah, and the young lady is here too.\u201dAs Philip spoke words of reassurance to Carter and Alicia, he stepped aside to display the golden wall he had cast. At the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but observe the silver-haired girl in the communication spell curiously. He had never heard that the Ascart House had a daughter too.Sigh! Look at how sorrowfully she is grieving over her older brother, the two of them must be close to one another! I should hurry up and show her that her older brother is fine so that she can put her heart at ease!Philip waved his hand, and the golden wall collapsed like a falling curtain. On the carpet behind the golden wall, two children were embracing one another tightly like lovers on the verge of kissing one another. He gestured to the two children as he continued speaking with a gracious smile.\u201cLook, they are safe and sound. There\u2019s no need to worry at all.\u201dIt was questionable whether Carter or Alicia, who now stood there stiffly, had heard his words at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - Life Is So HarPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 96: Life Is So HardA week later, in a classically designed room, a suave black-haired boy dressed in noble clothes sat on a sofa with dead fish eyes as he listened helplessly to a recount of his \u2018glorious deeds\u2019.He was Roel Ascart, the successor to the Ascart House. A lad who was so unlucky as to suddenly encounter king-level assassins the day right after the new year.While he was safe thanks to Holy Eminence John\u2019s protection\u2014he even managed to awaken his bloodline by a stroke of luck\u2014his life didn\u2019t return to normal after the incident was over. On the contrary, things seemed to be getting worse.\u201cThe rumor you mentioned\u2026 how far has it spread?\u201dAfter hearing Anna recount the rumor she had heard at the market, Roel was rendered mute for a moment before he asked with a flicker of hope in his eyes. Anna took some time to think of an appropriate way to convey just how widespread the rumors were before speaking.\u201cWhile I was purchasing supplies for the Ascart House, I met a total of 7 people from the merchant association. Of them, 6 asked me if the rumors are\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright! You need not say anymore.\u201dRoel hurriedly waved his hand to stop Anna from completing the sentence. Just thinking about the rumors made sweat trickle down his forehead, and he quickly wiped it off with his arm.The rumor was a story that had recently gone viral in the Holy Capital. From the members of royalty and high nobles all the way down to ordinary foot soldiers and servants, anyone who hadn\u2019t heard the story must have been living under a rock. It was a literary masterpiece that combined all of the elements necessary to make a bestseller, just that such effort was completely wasted on mere gossip.It was said that in Holy Capital Loren, there were two childhood friends who grew up together. They were both the sole successors of prestigious noble houses, and they came to fall in love with one another. However, as the two of them were already engaged, they were unable to come together as a couple.But, on the first day of the new year, the two of them found themselves unable to curb their feelings for one another any longer. Making use of the opportunity when the elders of their families were gone, they promised themselves to one another and eloped. Yet, in this moment of steaming, passionate bliss, evil cultists exploited a weakness in the defense of the Holy Capital caused by the festivities and assaulted them.After an intense battle that included many narrow encounters and crises, the two lovers managed to defeat the evil cultists by a narrow margin, but the boy ended up suffering severe injuries during the fight. In order to save her lover, the girl offered him her first kiss in order to evoke a spell to heal his wounds.However, this act was discovered by the rescue team dispatched to save them, and it was reported to the elders of their respective families. Their secret romance was exposed, they were grounded by their houses and punished severely for it.The end.Despite the simplicity of the story, there was a surprising amount of contention over it amongst the populace and the circle of nobility. There were many elements in the story, but the key point was \u2018lovebirds being forced apart due to an engagement\u2019. This was a thorn that stabbed deep in the nerves of many people.The freedom to love was one of the few cases where commoners felt superior to nobles. Due to the nature of the circle of nobility, the marriages between nobles were ever cursed to be used as political tools.Due to the presence of such contention, the story spread further and further, and it eventually evolved into a social movement. Nobles who had been through similar experiences couldn\u2019t help but shed a tear while recalling their pasts, and the masses vehemently objected to such irrational practice. In a rare show of unity between nobles and commoners, they demanded that the two lovers in the story be allowed to get together!Yes, that was right. Everyone actually knew who the protagonists in the story were. The scene about the girl giving away her first kiss to save the boy bore a great resemblance to the legend about an angel\u2019s first kiss\u2026 though the so-called legend was a mere rumor too. Rumors regarding the royal family tended to spread the fastest, after all.Roel would have enjoyed this drama as a spectator, but no, instead he was stuck with a leading role. He didn\u2019t have the luxury to sit back and watch the show idly anymore!Sighing deeply, he leaned back and stared blankly at the ceiling as he recounted the situation that day\u2026At the end of the battle between Victoria and Wade, he ended up sustaining severe injuries due to having borrowed Grandar\u2019s power. Victoria made use of this opportunity to urge Nora to make a move. Following that, the countdown struck zero, and they were brought back to the real world. The journey back involved intense turbulence and distortions, resulting in both Roel and Nora, who weren\u2019t in good conditions in the first place, to lose consciousness.He later heard from others that he and Nora had only disappeared for an hour that night. However, when the two of them finally returned, they were cloaked in dirt, and he was severely injured. Also, somehow, their postures were incredibly intimate.This should have been nothing much, but alas, the mana impartation effect Victoria mentioned really happened. That resulted in the bishop who discovered them not daring to separate them recklessly. It was only later when professional healers from the church arrived that the two were finally separated.Indeed, their intimate sleeping posture was on full display for a whole half hour! This was no different from a public execution for their reputations!To make things worse, this sight was broadcasted to Carter and Alicia through a communicator, which resulted in Alicia throwing a tantrum. Alicia was usually very mild-mannered, rarely losing her temper. However, once she was triggered, it was really not easy to placate her at all.The following day after the incident, she returned and bawled tearfully before him.\u201cBig brother Roel! Am I not good enough for you? Do you not want me anymore?\u201d\u201cOf course not! Where did you hear those words from? There\u2019s no way that I wouldn\u2019t want you!\u201dThe wronged look on Alicia\u2019s tearstained face made Roel\u2019s heart squeeze in pain. He simply couldn\u2019t stand watching her cry. He reached out to pull her in and hug her, but astonishingly, Alicia actually turned around and ran away tearfully, rejecting his embrace.\u201cA-Alicia?\u201dThis refusal was a heavy blow to Roel, causing him to just stand there foolishly, unsure of what to do now.What\u2019s happening? Why did things not go as I expected? Shouldn\u2019t Alicia reciprocate my hug and finally break out in a smile?Under Anna\u2019s disdainful gaze, Roel stood in a daze for a very, very long time.A week had passed since then, but the cold shoulder Alicia was giving him still showed no signs of thawing. Alicia seemed to be busy with something, so Roel didn\u2019t have any opportunities to see her. She wasn\u2019t even at the dining table during mealtimes! Apparently, she had received permission from Carter to have meals in her room.In other words, Roel had just been fired from his feeding job.\u201cIs this the end of the world? This must be the end of the world, right?\u201dRoel muttered to himself with dead eyes. He swallowed his food tearfully as he prayed that a day would come when Alicia finally changed her mind and came down to this dining table to reconcile with him.He sighed deeply as an unprecedented wave of lethargy swept over his soul. This must be how Garfield felt when he was deprived of lasagna.\u201cI\u2019m going to die if I don\u2019t get a dose of Aliciatonin soon\u2026\u201dListening to the weird mumblings of Roel, Anna couldn\u2019t help but think of just how despondent Alicia had become over the last few days. Her appetite had been getting worse and worse. In the first place, Alicia was a small eater. Previously, she would still try her best to eat a little more when Roel was feeding her, so that they could stay together for a little longer. But, over the past week, Alicia\u2019s food intake had reduced by half, or perhaps even more\u2026Anna thought about how worried the maids taking care of Alicia had been, and she sighed mournfully. For the children\u2019s happiness, she felt that she should find an opportunity to help the two of them reconcile and renew their bond.Oblivious to Anna\u2019s thoughts, Roel felt that everything in his eyes looked dull and boring. He had no motivation whatsoever, and he didn\u2019t want to do anything at all. He sent Anna away before lying down listlessly on the sofa.\u201cEverything has been so vexing recently.\u201dRoel placed his arm on his forehead as he muttered to himself. Far too many things had happened recently, and he felt that he needed to take some time off to think things over.It had been a week since he had returned from the Witness State and parted with Nora, but they hadn\u2019t been able to meet with one another ever since then. According to Carter, Nora needed some time in order to stabilize her Silver Bloodline, and during this period of time, she couldn\u2019t get too excited.Roel couldn\u2019t understand what \u2018getting too excited\u2019 had to do with meeting him, but in any case, it did seem like they were being kept apart from one another for the time being. In a sense, the rumor that had been going around wasn\u2019t completely unfounded.\u201cI wonder how Nora is doing at the moment\u2026\u201dAfter having gone through so much together, Roel\u2019s impression of Nora had improved greatly. It would be a lie to say that he didn\u2019t care about her. In fact, there was a tinge of worry within him that simply wouldn\u2019t settle down until he could finally verify with his own eyes that she was safe and sound.Another thing that Roel did after returning to this world was to check historical records, and he realized that there had been no changes to history at all. It was still stated that Wade was defeated by the returning Holy Eminence Ryan, and Victoria and Ponte hid in the Labyrinth Villa till the very last moment. Knowing this, his heart was set at ease as he affirmed his own deductions.Most likely, the world that he was brought to previously was just a short snippet of history. Anything that happened there wouldn\u2019t interfere with the real world. Roel\u2019s role was just a Witness, not a time traveler to change history.It made it seem like everything Roel and Nora did in that world was futile, but that wasn\u2019t really the case either. While they had indeed gone through great danger, nearly losing their lives on several occasions, they had received rewards proportionate to the peril they went through.In terms of strength, Roel had awakened his bloodline, received Grandar\u2019s blessing, and advanced his transcendent abilities significantly. He felt that he should be able to reach Origin Level 5 very soon. Meanwhile, Nora had successfully awakened her Silver Bloodline, which led to her already crazy fast growth speeding up even more.In terms of mental maturity, the two of them had grown by quite a bit after all the ordeals they had been through together. They had peered through the fabric of time and witnessed the fearless and brave spirits of Wade, Felder, Victoria, and Ponte as they strove to fulfill their visions for the future of the Theocracy. The experience had changed their thoughts on many matters, leading them to start peering beyond just the surface when looking at matters.Roel believed that their mental growth was far more important than their power growth. Prodigies like Nora didn\u2019t lack power; what they lacked was wisdom. The education of young nobles was still rather conventional, which led to them viewing the world in a simplistic, one-dimensional manner. They lacked the ability to truly think from other perspectives and utilize the power that was bestowed upon them effectively.This experience was probably the best practical lesson she could have, imprinting wisdom greater than any book could impart to her. It would help her decide on the path she wanted to walk on as a ruler and save her unnecessary detours.The only problem was the attitude she was taking toward him\u2026\u201cSurely she wouldn\u2019t treat me in the same manner that Victoria treats Ponte, right? That can\u2019t possibly be. We aren\u2019t in that kind of relationship in the first place. Ha hahaha.\u201dRoel consoled himself as he forced out a laugh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 - I Might Be Strong Now, But I\u2019m Poor!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 97: I Might Be Strong Now, But I\u2019m Poor!Victoria and Ponte were also from the Xeclydes and the Ascarts, so their behavior implicitly formed an example for Nora and Roel to follow, almost like role models.Just that they were negative role models.Just thinking of the way Victoria had Ponte tightly in her grasp made Roel feel deeply uncomfortable. He swore to himself that he would never end up suffering the same plight as his ancestor. That said, their interactions did spawn a sliver of doubt in his mind. While Ponte hadn\u2019t shown it explicitly, it was apparent that he had Victoria in his heart. Yet, the two of them still ended up parting ways in the end?Roel scratched his head in confusion. Could it be that the modified portions of history weren\u2019t just limited to Wade? Perhaps, there had been some tampering over on Victoria\u2019s side too. He didn\u2019t think that the two lovebirds, who thought of dying together under Wade\u2019s blade, would later actually split apart.Should I look through Ponte\u2019s diaries to find out?Such a thought did flash across Roel\u2019s mind for an instant, but he immediately shook his head reflexively. It was almost as if his mind was subconsciously rejecting the diaries, so that he could keep his mental sanity.\u201cForget it, it\u2019s too humiliating to read that stuff. Besides, I have something more important to deal with\u2026\u201dRoel muttered to himself as his eyes slowly turned sharp.Aside from power and knowledge, there was another important thing that Roel obtained from the Witness State\u2014military intelligence. He learned that Felder Elric was the same person as Bryan Elric. He didn\u2019t think that it was possible for the Calamity of Bloodshed to have made a mistake.So far, Roel hadn\u2019t told Nora about this matter, because he didn\u2019t have any evidence to back up his words, and this piece of information was completely useless back in the Witness State.However, now that the two of them had returned, the confidential information was, without a doubt, worth its weight in gold. It was just that there was still one, small, persnickety issue, and that was\u2026\u2026 he still didn\u2019t have any evidence.It had been more than a century since the March Turmoil, and Felder\u2019s existence had already been buried beneath the dust of history. There were no articles of evidence or eye-witnesses left that Roel could use to corroborate his story, and his one-sided words weren\u2019t powerful enough to achieve anything. If he recklessly made a move without planning things out thoroughly, he would only be unnecessarily alarming Bryan, making him more difficult to deal with.Despite all that, it was not like Roel was completely helpless. Bryan was not some hermit crab who could freely change his shell to live forever. Someone who had managed to live so long was bound to have some dirt on him, and there was a good chance that dirt was an evil cult. Now, he just had to dig carefully.Speaking of evil cults, the one behind the assassination attempt a week ago was paying a heavy price for its actions right now. Aside from the inquisitors dispatched by the church, his father, Marquess Carter, was not someone to be messed with either. He had divided his army into special task forces, and under the pretext of \u2018eliminating a threat to the Theocracy\u2019, he had them join in the hunt for the evil cultists.Due to the incidents at Nora\u2019s birthday banquet and the following reprisals, the Elric House had been severely weakened and would probably try to lie low for the time being. Considering this, Bryan was also unlikely to be able to pull anything in the short-run.Therefore, Roel could rest easy for the time being. He slept well and ate well. After going through the horrors of war, he finally realized how much of a blessing it was just to be alive and eat good food.Of course, he didn\u2019t just squander all his time resting during this period. He was also preparing himself for a breakthrough to Origin Level 5. This was a huge hurdle to overcome, so he had to ensure that he was thoroughly ready. Typically speaking, a transcendent would have to head to the church to request a Compassion Origin Attribute ritual for the advancement, but it was slightly different for him due to his peculiar circumstances.After awakening the Ascart Bloodline, Roel discovered that he had a Bloodline Origin Attribute, which, as the name suggested, was an Origin Attribute that was a perfect fit for his bloodline. It was relieving since, unlike heretical Origin Attributes, Bloodline Origin Attributes had a higher level of recognition in the Theocracy. After all, heretical Origin Attributes had influences from foreign gods, whereas Bloodline Origin Attributes are more specific to the individuals.This was good fortune for Roel. Bloodline Origin Attributes are actually incredibly rare, and most bloodline possessors aren\u2019t so lucky as to have one. More often than not, it was only found in noble houses with a long history behind them.These were the following notifications that Roel received when he regained consciousness after escaping the Witness State:\u3010Evaluation: Perfect (102)\u3011\u3010Bloodline awakening success.\u3011\u3010You have obtained the bloodline: Kingmaker\u2019s Bloodline (Bronze)\u3011\u3010The bell chimes amidst the mist, granting direction to the lost. You have chosen to leap beyond spacetime to bring consolation to the deceased.\u3011\u3010Degree of Bloodline Awakening: Perfect\u3011\u3010Tracing Bloodline Origin Attribute.\u3011\u3010Origin Attribute: Crown\u3011\u3010The Origin Attribute will be bestowed when the user successfully advances to Origin Level 5.\u3011It was through this series of notifications from the System that Roel knew that his hard work hadn\u2019t been in vain. It would appear that the only reason why he received a Bloodline Origin Attribute was due to his perfect awakening.As the saying went, \u2018a good steed requires a good saddle\u2019. From this aspect, the Crown Origin Attribute was without a doubt Roel\u2019s best choice, and it solved the issue of him being incompatible with the Three Main Origin Attributes.In Roel\u2019s view, becoming strong was necessary in order for him to break all of his death flags. He wouldn\u2019t give up growing as a transcendent just because he was incompatible with the Three Main Origin Attributes. His initial intention was to use the alliance between the Ascarts and the Xeclydes as leverage to negotiate with the royal family to turn a blind eye to him being a heretic. However, now that he was set to obtain the Crown Origin Attribute, there was no need for him to do that anymore.That wasn\u2019t the only thing that delighted Roel though. On top of raising his potential, he had also obtained a powerful skill too.\u3010Wade\u2019s Gift\u3011\u3010In his final moments, the dying king has acknowledged your beliefs and cast aside his hatred, bringing him peace in the afterlife.\u3011\u3010You have obtained army buff spell: Howl of Crimson Lightning\u3011\u3010Fury toward injustice, buried deep in the hearts of the people; their wrath manifests as crimson lightning, roaring against the irrational world.\u3011\u3010All allied soldiers in the vicinity will have their offensive and defensive prowess significantly enhanced, and they will be placed in a berserk state. The fighting prowess of soldiers in berserk state will be raised according to the predisposition of the individual. When the effect of the spell ends, there\u2019s a high probability that buffed soldiers will fall into a fatigued state.\u3011When Roel saw this technique, he nearly leaped up in ecstasy. He was even more excited than when he first saw the Crown Origin Attribute, and the reason behind that was because of the words \u2018army buff spell\u2019.Army buff spells were incredibly rare on the Sia Continent, such that anyone who possessed such a spell could easily take on a high-ranking position in the military. To put it in even more extreme terms, even an imbecile who knew nothing but an army buff spell would be headhunted by the military and paid handsomely. Of course, that person must be of a decent Origin Level, since such spells consumed a lot of mana.There was a very practical reason why army buff spells were so highly valued. In simple terms, it was a matter of efficiency. Most armies had squads specializing in casting buffs, but their buff spells were all single target. The mana cost would be unimaginably high if they tried to buff an entire army soldier by soldier, so the ones who were usually buffed were just the elites.On the other hand, the mana cost of army level spell buffs depended on the area covered, not the number of people affected. Some of the more potent multi-target buff spells could even be cast on an entire army.There were downsides though\u2014it was basically a trade-off between quality and quantity. The effectiveness of army buff spells at the individual level was much less when compared to individually targeted buffs. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of an army buff spell was more than enough to shift the tide during a battle. Even just a slight boost in stats for every soldier could create a huge variable in the outcome of a battle.As Roel had already had illustrated to him, Wade\u2019s army buff spell went far beyond \u2018just a slight boost in stats\u2019. It was a spell that he awakened during his breakthrough to Origin Level 2, and it fully showcased the burst power of the Wrath Origin Attribute. Every single soldier became unstoppable berserkers on the battlefield. With their sheer force, they tore a hole right through the defensive formation of Victoria\u2019s soldiers with ease.If utilized well, this army buff spell could become a weapon of mass destruction on the battlefield. He couldn\u2019t help but feel gladdened that he chose Wade back then. Had he chosen Victoria instead, even if he gained a good spell too, it was unlikely to be one as useful as this.On the whole, Roel was extremely satisfied with everything he had gained. His fighting prowess had definitely risen by a great deal, and he had gained several new trump cards to deal with the crises he would face in the uncertain future.However, there was one thing that he had been wondering ever since he returned from the Witness State\u2014where did Grandar go?It had been a week already, but the other party hadn\u2019t appeared in his dreams, not even once. This felt unnatural as, in Roel\u2019s view, Grandar was like a lonely, middle-aged man who enjoyed chatting with others. He wasn\u2019t the type of person to put on airs and disappear for a long period of time.In fact, even though it was just an inexplicable feeling, he sensed that his connection with Grandar had weakened considerably.Roel spent some time pondering over this question, and he eventually came up with a hypothesis. Most likely, the Witness State served as a medium that strengthened the connection between him and Grandar, allowing them to meet and interact with one another. When the Witness State ended, the connection between them was significantly weakened, preventing them from reaching out to one another anymore.That being said, as long as he obtained the Crown Origin Attribute, there was a good chance that he could strengthen the connection with Grandar once more.\u201cIt looks like I\u2019ll have to quickly reach Origin Level 5 and obtain the Crown Origin Attribute.\u201dRoel muttered to himself as he decided on a short-term goal. As for his long-term goal though\u2026\u3010System Notification: You currently owe the System 500,000 gold coins.\u3011\u3010Maturity date: 1815 days\u3011\u201cAh, son of a banshee! This is too much to repay!\u201dSeeing so many zeros in his account deficit made him feel like his head was going to explode. He might have profited a lot from the Witness State, but the price he had to pay was no joking matter either. Just this 500,000 gold coin loan was more than enough to plunge him into despair.\u201cYou\u2019re such a gold digger. Are you going to eat up all of the gold and mess up the economy in this world?\u201d\u3010The gold taken in by the System will be redistributed into the gold mines around the world. The System commits itself to be a sustainable business, so the user does not need to worry about that.\u3011???To put it in other words, you are collecting gold from me just for the sake of it? Aren\u2019t you just toying with me here? It\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re asking me to construct a building, only to tear it down right after!Thinking on the brighter side though, this also meant that Roel was single-handedly ensuring the sustainability of gold mining operations all over the Sia Continent, thus safeguarding the jobs of all miners! Surely such a feat was worthy of a Nobel prize?With a deep sigh, Roel began calculating the possibility of returning the money on time.Is it possible to get the Ascart House to fork out 500,000 gold coin? Mmm, it\u2019s not entirely impossible, but how can I justify where the money is going to? Can I just tell father that I\u2019m making a contribution to the gold mining operations all over the world? Hahaha, who would believe that\u2026Besides, if I suddenly take away so much money from the Ascart House, it could cause serious cash flow issues in the short-run. It seems like I\u2019ll have to think of a way to somehow earn the money myself\u2026Roel felt that he had to sit down together with Carter to have a long chat about this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - We\u2019ll Absolutely Fulfill Our PromisePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 98: We\u2019ll Absolutely Fulfill Our PromiseActually, regarding the loan repayment, Roel did consider whether he should just shirk his debt and not pay up at all. He would suck the System\u2019s blood dry before callously abandoning it, like a heartless man.After all, the System could still operate for another 5 years, even if Roel didn\u2019t pay it a single gold coin at all. If he could become a powerful expert by then, he wouldn\u2019t have any need for the System anymore.However, after thinking it through, he eventually chose to abandon this idea. There was no saying what would happen within 5 years\u2019 time, so it was best for him to keep the System with him. It was not as if he couldn\u2019t repay the 500,000 gold coin loan anyway. He could always earn more money if he needed to, but he wouldn\u2019t be able to find a second System anywhere else.With such thoughts in mind, Roel stood up and made his way over to Carter\u2019s study, hoping to discuss the governance of the Ascart Fiefdom with him.Roel felt that Carter was similar to those scions in a one of the soap dramas of his previous life, where the scions would rather cast aside the huge inheritance their fathers had left them just so they could chase their dreams. This could be seen from how Carter chose to focus his time on the military instead of developing the company (Ascart Fiefdom). It really pained Roel to see how so much potential was being put to waste when it could become something greater!As the successor of the Ascart House, Roel felt obliged to fill in the gap that his father had left behind! He decided that he would march up to Carter and have a thorough discussion about this matter, hoping to obtain partial rights to govern the fiefdom.His burning motivation was to be disappointed.\u201cAh? My father is not around?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The old master has been summoned to the royal palace.\u201d\u201cThe royal palace? Hm\u2026\u201dRoel couldn\u2019t help but think about the rumors about him and Nora that had been heard all around town lately, and he felt a little jittery inside.It can\u2019t be that Carter has been called there for that matter, right?\u2026While Roel was feeling uneasy inside, Marquess Carter was meeting an unexpected figure in the royal palace\u2014Holy Eminence John Xeclyde.While John Xeclyde was, in name, the emperor of the Saint Mesit Theocracy, Carter didn\u2019t have too many opportunities to come into contact with him. The Xeclydes had simply far too many organizations beneath it to manage.All in all, the organizations the Xeclydes were managing could be divided into two segments: the major organization and the minor organizations.Needless to say, the major organization referred to the Genesis Goddess Church. It was a massive and powerful establishment; its every move could spur rippling effects over all humanity. It was the binding factor that united humans during times of crisis, but even during peacetime, it was important to manage relations and ensure the church\u2019s incorruptibility.On the other hand, the minor organizations referred to the powers and noble houses of the Saint Mesit Theocracy. As the royal family, the Xeclydes had to take the center position and keep everyone in check.However, there was a limit to any single person\u2019s energy, including Holy Eminence John. So, he chose to focus on the affairs of the church, entrusting the governance of the Saint Mesit Theocracy into the hands of his son and loyal subjects. It was only during important national ceremonies that Holy Eminence John would make an appearance in his position as the emperor.Carter didn\u2019t have an official position in the church, so he didn\u2019t have too many opportunities to interact with this patriarch of the Xeclyde House. Thinking back, the last time he really talked to the latter was when he was officially appointed as the vice commander of the Holy Knight Order.Unlike the solemn atmosphere back then, their meeting this time around was much more amicable; too amicable, in fact. It was to the point that Carter instinctively sensed that there was something amiss here. Looking at the warm smile of the old man before him, Carter quickly doused his heart with cold water as he reminded himself that he ought to tread carefully.\u201cCarter, I trust that you\u2019re familiar with the details of that incident concerning those two children, right?\u201dAfter trading some pleasantries, Holy Eminence John finally got to the main point, raising the topic of the recent assassination attempt on Roel and Nora. In response, Carter immediately took on an attitude of self-reproach.\u201cYour Eminence, I\u2019m deeply apologetic about this incident. It was an assassination attempt on Roel\u2019s life, but we ended up implicating Her Highness Nora too, putting her life at risk. I seek your pardon on this\u2026\u201dCarter wasn\u2019t fond of dealing with politics, but that didn\u2019t mean that he was bad at it. He uttered a full set of lip service, starting from expressing his fury toward the deeds of the vile evil cultists to his apologies for involving Her Highness Nora in this affair before finally concluding with his gratitude toward the Holy Eminence\u2019s generous help. Even the grumpiest of critics couldn\u2019t have possibly picked any flaws with his monologue!Meanwhile, John nodded occasionally throughout the monologue to express his understanding of the matter. At the end of which, he even spoke words to assuage Carter\u2019s self-reproach.\u201cCarter, this was a situation that none of us hoped to see, but since it has already happened, I think that it\u2019s only apt for us to work together and come up with a countermeasure. May I know what your thoughts on this matter are?\u201dSeeing where Holy Eminence John was leading the conversation, Carter finally understood the motive behind this audience. It was no exaggeration to say that the church had gone all out for Roel this time around, dispatching inquisitors all over the country to apprehend the evil cultists. It was only natural that such an act of generosity must be met with reciprocation.Carter figured that Holy Eminence John was sending a subtle message for the Ascart House to offer something in return, but what could this \u2018something\u2019 be? Dispatch soldiers to help with the elimination of the evil cultists? Aid the Xeclydes in suppressing the Elrics?Carter looked at the white-haired old man before him uneasily, fearing what the latter would ask for. On the other hand, John smiled softly and calmly revealed his intention.\u201cI believe that we should assign Nora as Roel\u2019s protector, what do you think?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s worth consi\u2026 Huh? I mean, pardon me, but what did you just say?\u201dCarter instinctively tried to postpone the decision-making process, but halfway through his words, he suddenly processed what Holy Eminence John had just suggested. He raised his head with widened eyes, bewildered.\u201cI propose that we should assign Nora as Roel\u2019s protector. I personally believe that it\u2019s a move that\u2019s beneficial to both of our houses. Marquess Carter, if you have any reservations regarding what I have just proposed, you may feel free to voice it out.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant! I\u2019m just a little\u2026 surprised.\u201dDespite his years of experience in politics, Carter found himself incapable of comprehending the current situation. It was one thing for the Xeclydes to take the initiative in lending a helping hand to the Ascarts, but instead of asking for something in return, they were saying that they would continue protecting them for life\u2026 How could there be such a good thing in life?!Of course, Carter didn\u2019t know that such an act was equivalent to entrusting his son into the clutches of the devil, or else he wouldn\u2019t have been so confused.Noticing that Carter was overwhelmed by his proposal, Holy Eminence John began to explain the rationale behind his offer.\u201cCarter, there\u2019s a contract between both of our houses.\u201dJohn straightened his back as his expression smoothed out to look more saintly than ever. He spoke with a deep voice that added a touch of solemnity to the atmosphere.\u201cAt the inception of the Third Epoch, when the Ascart House sought refuge with the Theocracy, our predecessors signed a contract with one another. As long as an offspring of the Ascart House successfully awakens his bloodline, those bearing the Angel\u2019s Bloodline will protect him till adulthood. Since Roel has managed to awaken the Ascart Bloodline, I believe that it\u2019s only right for us to invoke the clauses of the contract.\u201cThe Xeclydes shall hold to the end of their promise!\u201dHoly Eminence John looked at Carter with a terrifyingly grave look, almost as if saying \u2018anyone who stops us from protecting Roel is insulting our predecessors!\u2019. Carter, on the other hand, was just dumbfounded. Thinking about it, there was indeed such a contract.A thousand years was a long period of time. During this period of time, the Ascart House, excluding Roel, had only two transcendents who managed to awaken the Ascart Bloodline. Probably even the patriarchs before him had already forgotten about the existence of this contract!Besides, so what if he had remembered the contract?Was he supposed to take a sheet of paper and demand that the Xeclydes serve as their bodyguards?Quite bluntly, this contract was only valid so long as the Xeclydes were willing to recognize it. Otherwise, it was just a piece of scrap paper.Yet, the Xeclydes actually approached them on their own accord, offering to fulfill this thousand years old contract. Carter was definitely moved by this proposal, but for Her Highness Nora to become Roel\u2019s protector\u2026 Wasn\u2019t this a little inappropriate?\u201cYour Eminence, as you may know, there is a great deal of gossip going around about Roel and Her Highness Nora. If you were to assign Her Highness as Roel\u2019s protector at such a timing, wouldn\u2019t it further fan the rumors?\u201dCarter voiced out his own worries.It was the duty of the royal family to protect its people, so there were indeed times when the royal family would declare their protection of an individual. It could be a vulnerable successor of a noble house whose parents had been assassinated and was thus left without backing, or the child of a family of soldiers whose kin had all died in war.However, the \u2018protection\u2019 aforementioned wasn\u2019t physically assigning soldiers to these individuals but just protection in name. The royal family would hold a grand ceremony and declare their protection of an individual under the witness of the nobles. It was actually just a warning to everyone that whoever dared to mess with that kid would be messing with the Xeclydes too.Even though this protection was in name only, it was usually extremely effective. This was because the Xeclydes, as possessors of the Angel\u2019s Bloodline, viewed their reputation and honor highly, and they would retaliate aggressively against those who dared undermine them.Take the vulnerable successor mentioned above for example, the enemies of the noble house had attempted to poison the successor even after the Xeclydes had made their declaration. Fortunately, the successor survived the assassination attempt, but even so, the Xeclydes still felt greatly humiliated by the matter. They ordered Inquisitor Hall to dig deep into the matter and arrested every single noble who was involved in the poisoning.So, while Carter was in full support of having Nora become Roel\u2019s protector, given the gossip going around recently, they would only be adding to the rumor mill by holding a protector declaration ceremony involving the two of their houses.The royal family\u2019s reputation was at stake here, and Carter felt that it would be wise to refrain from muddying up the waters any further. Unexpectedly, Holy Eminence John appeared to think little of this matter.\u201cIt\u2019s even more so during times of lies and falsehood that we must stand proud and confident. If we back down here, we\u2019ll only be telling the world that we have something to hide.\u201dHoly Eminence John spoke with a voice so assertive that Carter was subconsciously dragged into his train of thoughts.Hm? It does sound logical, but why do I still feel like something is not right\u2026Carter was a little too overwhelmed by the situation to really think straight. Meanwhile, the clear-minded Holy Eminence John knew that he had to strike the iron while it was hot, so he continued pushing the case forward.\u201cThe Xeclydes will hold to the end of our promise. If we can\u2019t overcome this bit of trouble, how can we call ourselves the descendants of angels? Alright, I have made up my mind. We shall hold the ceremony half a month from now!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - It\u2019s Time For a CounteraPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99: It\u2019s Time For a CounterattackIn the royal palace, after sending away Marquess Carter, Holy Eminence John leaned back in his chair and exhaled deeply.How long had it been since he last proactively pushed his ideas on another person?For many years now, he had never needed to take the initiative to carry a discussion. His guests would respectfully speak non-stop in his presence, and all he needed to do was to indicate with either a nod or a shake of his head. He had never thought a day would come where he would have to coax another party like a desperate salesman once more.Ey, I guess it can\u2019t be helped. It\u2019s all for the children.Just the thought of his precious granddaughter made John heave a deep sigh. For his granddaughter, who had been completely out-of-it ever since she returned from the ordeal, he could only put down his pride and personally make a move.Indeed. Just like Alicia, Nora hadn\u2019t been eating much recently either. It was normal for those of the Angel\u2019s Bloodline to require some time for their powers to settle down after an awakening, and it would typically take around 10 days. However, for a person whose first observation after opening her eyes was the absence of Roel, 10 days was far too long.Nora had fallen unconscious shortly after being egged on by Victoria into kissing Roel, so she was unaware of how Roel was doing at the moment. Of course, she did receive news from the Ascart House that Roel was faring well, but still, her heart simply couldn\u2019t rest easy unless she were to verify it in person.And when a child starts losing appetite, the ones to suffer are the parents. This is simply how the world worked.The reason why John was able to harden his heart and send Nora in together with Roel for his trial was because he thought that it was an ordeal that the Xeclydes had to overcome. When it came to everyday life, however, John was just the typical doting grandfather.Putting aside his worries for Nora, he was actually rather concerned about Roel\u2019s condition too.From Nora\u2019s account, he learned of Roel\u2019s actions during that snippet of history, and he wasn\u2019t surprised to learn that Roel had ties with a powerful ancient being. Nevertheless, he was concerned about the colossal strength that the ancient being had displayed through Roel.According to Nora, Wade had already advanced to Origin Level 2. Despite being limited by a last moment breakthrough and severe injuries, it was still unthinkable that he would actually be defeated by Roel. After all, Roel was someone who didn\u2019t have an Origin Attribute yet, so he shouldn\u2019t have been able to exert the true strength of the ancient being.Looking at history, the members of the Ascart House who had managed to awaken their hereditary bloodline eventually became notable figures, and they were a stalwart ally of the Xeclydes in their respective generations. In a sense, the Xeclydes\u2019 offer to protect Roel was kind of like an investment that was almost guaranteed to profit them handsomely\u2014and there was a good chance that they could buy over their \u2018invested business\u2019 too.It was out of consideration of this that John decided to go all out this time.He had no intention of forcing the two children together, but nevertheless, it wouldn\u2019t hurt for him to give his granddaughter a little push. After all, this was the first time that Nora was showing any interest in her peers.To be honest, there were many people with bizarre quirks in the history of the Xeclydes. John hadn\u2019t noticed Nora\u2019s sadistic streak yet, but his tingling senses were telling him that there was definitely something there. Considering Roel\u2019s nature, he might just be able to embrace her shortcomings too.\u201cI\u2019ve already done what I can to help. All that is left is to wait and see how far they can get.\u201dThe old man sighed deeply again before rising from his seat and heading toward the depths of the royal palace.\u2026Roel learned something new today, and that was humans had limits.\u201cIs Alicia eating in her room once again? Haaa\u2026\u201dRoel stared listlessly at the sumptuous lunch spread before him as he fiddled with his soup with his spoon. A human could still survive a week without food, but a day without Aliciatonin was like a year without rain. Mealtimes were supposed to be his daily doses of happiness, where he satisfied both his appetite and healed his heart. But now\u2026\u201cHow bland. Everything is so bland\u2026\u201dRoel ate the food carefully prepared by the chefs with an expression so impassive he might as well have been munching on wax candles. He knew that this was simply a byproduct of his horrible mood, but what could he do about that? If humans could control how they were feeling, they wouldn\u2019t be humans anymore.\u201cIs it because we aren\u2019t blood-related? Is that why Alicia has already grown sick and tired of me in just half a year?\u201dHe had already gotten so close to Alicia, and he thought that their relationship would remain that way till parted by death. But how did everything come to this point\u2026Roel continued stirring the soup before him in a daze. He was in such a horrible state that even the maid standing behind him couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. It was true that Anna was the manager of the Roel X Alicia Ship fanclub, but before that, she was Roel\u2019s personal maid. It was her job to take care of Roel\u2019s needs.\u201cYoung master, you need to pull it together.\u201dAnna approached her slouching young master and advised him respectfully.\u201cIt has already been several days now, and I imagine that Miss Alicia has already cooled down by now. You need not be so pessimistic.\u201d\u201cPessimistic? Am I being pessimistic here?\u201dHaaa, what do you think?Anna stared at the downcast Roel so intently that it brought a sliver of self-realization to him.\u201cIs that really so? Was I being too pessimistic? But, what I said is the truth! Alicia doesn\u2019t need me to feed her anymore, so I have become useless to her. She detests me and doesn\u2019t even want to see me anymore. Ahh, is this the end of the world?\u201d\u201cYoung master, you could be misunderstanding something here. Why would Miss Alicia detest you?\u201d\u201cShe doesn\u2019t detest me? If she doesn\u2019t detest me, why would she refuse to meet me? This doesn\u2019t make any sense at all! Now that I think about it, girls at her age tend to change their preferences very quickly. I get it now. I was too complacent. I thought that I had already left a favorable impression on her, but the goodwill she feels for me has already expired, right? I\u2019m nothing more than a speck of dust in her history now\u2026\u201dIt was like an endless chain of negativity; Roel was constantly looking for new excuses to shut himself down. Looking at how her young master was on the verge of becoming a cripple, Anna felt that she really had to do something or else things could blow up.\u201cYoung master, Miss Alicia\u2019s feelings for you haven\u2019t changed. She\u2019s just\u2026 throwing a tantrum after seeing your unseemly appearance with Her Highness.\u201d\u201cI know that too. Alicia is a person who lacks security. It\u2019s only normal for her to be fearful of my improving relations with Nora\u2026\u201d replied Roel with a deep sigh.He understood that children were very vulnerable to jealousy and fear. When he was younger, he remembered how betrayed he felt when a friend who used to always play together with him chose to play with other kids. He had never spoken to that friend ever since then. But, it was different between him and Alicia. They were family members, so how could he possibly abandon her for Nora?However, it would be difficult for him to convey this to Alicia properly. After all, Alicia didn\u2019t even want to see him anymore.While Roel thought that he had already accurately identified the root of the problem, Anna was starting to realize that there was something very wrong with her young master\u2019s train of thought.Security? Fearful?\u201cYoung master, regarding that\u2026 I don\u2019t think that Miss Alicia is fearful. She\u2019s just throwing a tantrum out of jealousy.\u201dJealousy? What jealousy?Roel frowned in confusion. The expression on his face caused Anna\u2019s eyes to widen; she was speechless. She suddenly felt incredibly exasperated and vexed. There was a long moment of silence before Roel gradually understood the meaning behind Anna\u2019s words, and he burst into laughter.\u201cHahaha! Anna, what are you talking about? Alicia is a child!\u201d\u201cChild? Young master, there\u2019s only 2 years of difference between you and Miss Alicia. There isn\u2019t too huge a gap between the two of you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, but we\u2019re siblings! You\u2019re really thinking too much into this.\u201dRoel waved his hands confidently with a proud look that said \u2018there\u2019s no one in this world who knows Alicia better than I do\u2019. His response struck one of Anna\u2019s nerves, and she had to summon her inner nirvana in order to not lose her temper.I shan\u2019t get angry. I shan\u2019t get angry. I shan\u2019t get angry\u2026Anna tried her best to soothe the rage that was on the verge of bursting forth as she silently took deep breaths. She looked at Roel and considered whether she should relay Alicia\u2019s feelings to Roel. In the end, she chose not to interfere too much in their relationship.It was one thing to support the two of them, and it was another thing to get involved in it herself.Besides, even though Roel was having a major misunderstanding over here, it didn\u2019t change the fact that he was already firmly in Alicia\u2019s grasp, to the point that he was almost an addict. Looking at it from this perspective, it could be said that their relationship was still quite stable. They were so emotionally dependent on one another that they could hardly stay apart.In any case, the foundation was already there. If they were to walk down this journey a step at a time, their feelings for one another would surely be stronger than ever.With such thoughts in mind, Anna calmed her emotions down as she suddenly felt a feeling of enlightenment. Such small turbulence wasn\u2019t an issue at all.That said, it wouldn\u2019t do for the two of them to keep remaining estranged from one another. Of the three masters of the Labyrinth Villa, one was hardly around and the other two were just gloomy all day long. The atmosphere was simply too heavy to bear. Even the chefs in the kitchen had noticed that something was wrong, and they spent long hours staring at the plates that had barely been eaten from in shock, wondering if their culinary skills had deteriorated.\u201cYoung master, do you wish to reconcile with Miss Alicia?\u201d\u201cOf course! If it was possible, I would have already done it by now! It\u2019s just that she keeps avoiding me, so how can I find an opportunity to approach her\u2026\u201d replied Roel with a sigh.An unfathomable smile curled on Anna\u2019s lips.\u201cHow about leaving it to us then?\u201d\u201cYou all?\u201d\u201cIndeed. We\u2019ll create an opportunity for you to reconcile with Miss Alicia. What do you think about that?\u201dRoel looked at the smiling maid before him with doubtful eyes. He had already spent the last few days attempting all sorts of things, but nothing worked at all. What could Anna and the other servants possibly do?\u201cIf you\u2019re confident about it, you can go ahead and do what you need to.\u201dRoel replied listlessly, clearly not bearing much hope. He couldn\u2019t have known that he had just released the powerful secret organization that had been lying undercover in the Ascart House, the Roel X Alicia fanclub.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - The PlanPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100: The PlanThe patriarchs of the Ascart House had always been interested in the military. Many of them had taken on important roles in the Theocracy\u2019s military, so the Ascart House could be considered as half a military house. It was probably due to the influence of its military background that gave rise to a similar culture in the house as well.One of the reasons behind that was probably due to its recruitment policies. Servants who were skilled in swordsmanship were given extra points during their interview, and maids with any direct kin in the military were prioritized.On top of that, the Ascart House was actually a good place to work. All of the employees were paid decently, and the workload imposed on them was manageable. There was hardly any workplace politics like one would see in dramas. Due to that, there were always a lot of applicants seeking work.Given such recruitment conditions, most of those eventually hired could be said to be quite capable in their own rights. When all of them united together as one to achieve a single goal, they showed military-level discipline and efficiency.After receiving explicit approval from Roel, Anna didn\u2019t rush to make a move. Instead, the first thing she did was to gather some of the key members of the Roel X Alicia Ship fanclub to hold a meeting so as to share critical intelligence with one another.In a dark room lit only by a candlelight, several figures were gathered around a long table, and the one heading them, Anna, sat at the very end of the table. Her sharp eyes scanned all of the figures present, and a slight knot formed upon her brow.\u201cWhere\u2019s Butler Fulte?\u201d\u201cThe old master is heading out tomorrow morning. Fulte is making preparations at the moment, so he\u2019ll be a little late.\u201d\u201cWe shan\u2019t wait for him then. Let\u2019s commence the meeting.\u201dAnna nodded her head contemplatively and made the call to carry on with the meeting. All of the maids and manservants gathered around the long table immediately turned their focus to her.The meeting started off with an opening speech that depicted the crisis they were facing before proceeding on to lay out the agenda of the meeting. Following that, everyone began their report.\u201cOur young miss has looked at the door 11 times today. Every single time someone knocks on the door or footsteps sound by the corridor, she would react intensely. She started using forks and knives during mealtime, but her mood still remains clouded. Her appetite has further reduced from a third yesterday to a quarter today\u2026\u201d\u201cOur young master\u2019s appetite is still decent. It has only fallen by a third.\u201d\u201cNo no, you can\u2019t look at the matter so simplistically. Our young master is a glutton, so the fact that his appetite has fallen by a third marks a huge crisis!\u201d\u201cMiss Alicia\u2019s quality of sleep has also been dipping over the last few days. On average, she has only been sleeping 4 hours each day.\u201dListening to the words spoken by the fanclub, Anna began piecing the information together to form a big picture. Based on what she had gathered so far, the root of this problem was still the misunderstanding between the two children. Alicia was clearly throwing a tantrum, but Roel wasn\u2019t even able to identify the real reason behind that.\u201cAre we still keeping the fact that the young miss is studying spells for the young master\u2019s sake a secret?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid that we can\u2019t work the case from there. The young miss insists on hiding this matter from the young master, possibly fearing that it would wound the young master\u2019s pride, and, in turn, result in the loss of the young master\u2019s doting and protection.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that Miss Alicia needs to worry about that.\u201dAnna, who was familiar with Roel, shook her head and sighed deeply. It was unlikely that Roel would stop doting on Alicia just because she had become strong. On the contrary, Roel might rejoice even.It was similar to how humans might not necessarily be a match for wild cats, but did that stop humans from wanting to stroke them?\u201cIf Miss Alicia doesn\u2019t take the initiative here, the situation will become one where she is working hard for the young master, but the young master is cheating on her outside.\u201d\u201cUwuuu, the young miss is so pitiful!!!\u201d\u201cQuiet, we\u2019re still in the middle of a meeting here!\u201dAnna sternly berated the maid to maintain the discipline in the meeting before quickly gathering the inputs thus far to state her analysis.\u201cAfter several days of cooling down, the conflict between the two of them has more or less settled down. Both sides have indicated a strong inclination toward reconciliation.\u201cHowever, after being repeatedly rejected over the last few days, the young master has started to close himself off and stopped looking for Miss Alicia. On the other hand, Miss Alicia doesn\u2019t know how she should face the young master after throwing a tantrum. This is the problem that we need to resolve right now.\u201d\u201cBut how do we go about doing it\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very simple.\u201dFaced with the question from her subordinate, the fanclub manager stood proudly as a sharp glint flashed across her eyes.\u201cWe just need to knock down the door that stands between the young master and Miss Alicia.\u201d\u2026\u201cYoung miss, won\u2019t you eat a little more? This is the freshest Hayley fish which was shipped here straight from the port.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already full.\u201dIn a huge bedroom located at the west of the Labyrinth Villa, Alicia put down her fork as she shook her head to refuse the delectable fish that was not lacking in taste, fragrance, or appearance.\u201cI don\u2019t have much of an appetite recently.\u201d\u201cI see. I shall convey your words to the chef so that they can make adjustments accordingly.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s not it. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the chefs! The dishes are wonderful; it\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d\u201cYoung miss, you need not worry about this. I\u2019ve heard that the young master hasn\u2019t been eating much recently, so it has to be the chefs\u2019 fault!\u201dThose unexpected words from her maid caught Alicia off-guard. She slowly raised her head to look at her maid, and after a moment of hesitation, she asked.\u201cD-does Lord Brother\u2026 not have much of an appetite either?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 I heard from the other maids that he has barely eaten anything at all.\u201dThe maid waiting on Alicia stroked her lower jaw, seemingly recounting what she had heard from her colleagues.\u201cIt appears that the young master hasn\u2019t even been eating half of what he previously did. It\u2019s really worrying. After the huge ordeal he went through, he should have been eating well so that he could recover properly.\u201d\u201cNot even half?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard. Anna has been really worried about him recently.\u201dThe maid heaved a deep sigh as she began to clean up the plates and cutlery.On the other hand, Alicia began to fidget uneasily on the spot. She knew just how much of a glutton Roel was. For his appetite to actually be this poor\u2026\u201cW-wait a moment! Is Lord Brother ill? Has he seen a doctor yet?\u201d\u201cHe has already been diagnosed by the doctor, but it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s physically ill. The doctor says that it\u2019s a problem stemming from his mood.\u201d\u201cHis mood?\u201d\u201cYes, young miss. He must have been having a rough time. He has been wandering about listlessly the last few days, and everyone is worried that his body will crumble at this rate!\u201dThe maid agilely packed everything up and placed it back onto the tray before walking out and closing the door behind her, leaving a deeply worried Alicia back in the room.I-is it because of me? Is it because I refused to meet big brother Roel over the last few days, that\u2019s why he\u2019s not eating at all?Alicia\u2019s little forehead scrunched up with worry. Roel\u2019s body was covered with wounds the last time she saw him, and his condition was so frail after that assassination attempt. He was still in the recovery phase, making it extremely important for him to eat well. If he were to skip his meals at a time like this\u2026Worry and self-reproach swiftly expanded in Alicia\u2019s heart. In truth, she wasn\u2019t angry anymore after having several days to cool down. It was just that she had never really thrown a tantrum before, so she had no idea how to reconcile with Roel. As a result, this matter was pushed back again and again, all the way till now.She was initially intending to wait a few more days before returning back to the dining room to have her meals. However, what she had just heard from her maid left her feeling deeply unsettled. After all, was there anything more important than Roel\u2019s health and safety?\u201cWhat has Lord Brother been doing recently?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s still on the same routine as before. He hasn\u2019t resumed classes yet as the old master says that he still needs rest, so he has been devoting his time to self-study and practicing his swordsmanship.\u201d\u201cThat reminds me, I heard from Anna that the young master seemed a little out of it while he was practicing his swordsmanship yesterday, and he nearly injured himself.\u201d\u201cW-Wait a moment! What\u2019s that about?!\u201dYet another bombshell was dropped on Alicia, causing her heart to contract sharply. Her agitated state appeared to have astonished the maids, such that all of them began to stutter.\u201cA-actually it\u2019s nothing much. The young master often skips his swordsmanship classes, and the old master has reprimanded him for it many times before.\u201d\u201cThe young master has injured himself several times before in his swordsmanship practice. Miss Alicia, you need not think too deeply into it.\u201dThe maids tried their best to reassure Alicia that she was not to blame here, but the girl only felt more and more uncomfortable hearing their words. What the maids had just mentioned was not wrong, but those were past incidents. Over the past half a year, Roel had been training diligently, his sword skills could no longer be compared to how they used to be. It was impossible for him to injure himself under normal circumstances.Just the thought of Roel being nicked by a sword was more than enough to fill her with fright. She was able to overcome her fear of sharp objects, but she couldn\u2019t stand the thought of her loved one being injured by one.\u201cI\u2019ll be having my food at the dining table tonight. I\u2019ll meet Lord Brother.\u201dAfter some consideration, Alicia finally came to a decision. However, those words that came out of her mouth provoked an intense response from the maids around her.\u201cYoung miss, what are you talking about? Have you forgotten what happened? How can you forgive the young master so easily?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, young miss. You mustn\u2019t give in that easily!\u201dThe two maids who had been taking care of Alicia ever since she arrived at the Labyrinth Villa immediately began putting Roel down as soon as the latter was mentioned.\u201cMiss Alicia has been working hard to learn spells for the young master\u2019s sake, but what did the young master do? He actually cheated with Her Highness behind your back! He must be making light of you!\u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t it. I think that\u2026\u201d\u201cIndeed! The young master must be thinking that he already has our young miss in his hands, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s acting in such a manner. All men are the same! Young miss, you need not worry. You have our support! It has only been a few days since that incident. In my view, you should leave him hanging for a month!\u201dA tight frown formed on Alicia\u2019s face upon hearing those words. She tried to calm these two maids down, but it wasn\u2019t working very well.\u201cYoung miss, there\u2019s no need to worry. We have the support of everyone in the villa. We\u2019ll surely make the young master see the errors of his ways!\u201d\u201cIndeed! Young miss, you need not worry too much about this. You can just leave it to us! Be it your meals, walks, or baths, we\u2019ll make sure to liaise with the maids over at the young master\u2019s side so that you won\u2019t bump into him by accident!\u201d\u201cWait a moment, I think that this is a little excessive!\u201dThe guarantees of the maids left Alicia horrified. Upon hearing that the maids and servants of the villa were on her side, she belatedly realized that she had made a major mistake. Unknowingly, she had diminished Roel\u2019s standing amongst the servants.This won\u2019t do. At this rate, Lord Brother\u2019s reputation will be affected too!While Alicia was panicking inside, the two maids exchanged looks. One of them secretly pulled a string, ringing a bell outside. A few seconds later, a maid suddenly rushed into the room in a fluster.\u201cYoung miss, bad news! The young master has fallen ill!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
