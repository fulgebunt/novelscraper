Her lady has arranged you another engagement.\u201d Mo Yi rushed into the room.A young man, wearing a pair of loose underpants, lying on a rattan chair, waving a cattaill leaf fan, looked at Mo Yi with the corner of his eyes,\u201d No worries. It\u2019s just an engagement, not a marriage! It can be cancelled. It\u2019s not the first time. Once a cancellation, always a cancellation. Easy. Easy.\u201dMo Yi looked at his young master and said, \u201cYoung master, you are so calm!\u201dThe young man smiled proudly, \u201cOf course. Who am I? Come on! I am Mo Fei, the Mo Fei who has been rejected for sixteen times. Whom am I engaged with this time? Do you have a photo?\u201dMo Yi took out a photo quickly, \u201cHe is the second son of the Lin\u2019s, the one who owns a restaurant. Here is his photo.\u201dMo Fei looked at it and was shocked, \u201cWow, he must weigh over 150kg. It\u2019s not hard to understand. After all, he owns a restaurant. Look at his body, wow\u2026\u201d\u201cYoung master, you really have sharp eyes. He weighs 166.5kg.\u201d Mo Yi \u00a0sucked up.Looking at the photo, Mo Fei pursed her lips,\u201d Whoever becomes his wife will be very unlucky. It is possible that he might crush his wife dead in his sleep.\u201d\u201cYoung master, you are so clever. He did actually crush his wife to death in his sleep a few days ago. That\u2019s why he is engaged with you.\u201d Mo Yi said.\u201cNo wonder people always say woman\u2019s heart is the most poisonous. How dare that old evil woman engage me to such a man?!\u201d Mo Yi\u2019s face twitched.Mo Yi eyed Mo Fei with a signal. Mo Fei looked at the door where a woman in delicate makeup was standing.\u201cWhat brings you here, mother?\u201d Mo Fei looked at her with the corner of her eyes. It was Lin Xi, Mo Fei\u2019s stepmother.\u201cI have come to see you. You are not my own, but I have always treated you as my own.\u201d Lin Xi looked at Mo Fei and said.Mo Fei patted his chest to prevent himself from vomiting, OS: \u201cOh my god! Is this bitch shameful to tell such a big lie?\u201dLin Xi ignored Mo Fei twisted face and said kindly, \u201cLin is a little fat, but he owns a big restaurant. If you marry him, you will have an abundant life.\u201dMo Fei snorted and argued in her heart, \u201cA little fat?! Seriously?\u201dLin Xi looked at Mo Fei and sneered, \u201cWhether you like it or not, it\u2019s settled. You\u2019d better behave yourself and don\u2019t play tricks. Lin once met you before. Your treasure box is useless.\u201dThe woman sneered and walked away.Mo Fei and Mo Yi yelled at the same time when the woman walked out of their sights, \u201cBitch!\u201d\u201cYoung master, do you still need the treasure box?\u201d Mo Yi asked.Mo Fei had a set of makeup tools in the box. He scared off a few blind dates by making himself looking terrible.\u201cThe bitch says he\u2019s seen me before. It won\u2019t work.\u201d Mo Fei narrowed his eyes.Mo Yi got upset, \u201cYoung master, if you can\u2019t play ugly, what should we do?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, I am smart as a whip. I have a lot of solutions way more than playing ugly.\u201d Mo Fei snorted.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He turned the mirror upside down. It was a shame that he was reborn as a sissy.\u201cYoung master, Lin has invited you to meet at his restaurant.\u201d Mo Yi said.Mo Fei squinted at him and said, \u201cLin\u2019s restaurant? Is it the incredibly expensive restaurant?\u201d\u201cYes, young master.\u201d Mo Yi nodded.Mo Fei stood up and said, \u201cThat bitch wants to marry me to a gangster shop owner.\u201dMo Yi hung his head down and said nothing.Mo Fei stood up and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dMo Fei walked into Lin\u2019s restaurant where Lin Zhong was already waiting. When Mo Fei saw his photo before, it never occurred to him that he would be so fat. Now that he was sitting there almost taking up half of the table, he was shocked.But Lin Zhong was excited to see Mo Fei.Mo Fei walked toward Lin and sat at the other end of the table.Glared by Lin, Mo Fei felt like he was a cute rabbit being preyed on by a mammoth.\u201cOrder whatever you want.\u201d Said Lin.Mo Fei took over the menu, shocked by the price. The restaurant raised such a fat child by making so much black money.Mo Fei ordered five relatively cheap dishes with her shaking hands. Lin, leaning on the chair while shaking his legs, said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to save money for me. I am rich.\u201d\u201cStop shaking! You are breaking the chair.\u201d Mo Fei smiled slightly and thought to himself.Lin looked up and down at him, \u201cYou are very gorgeous!\u201dMo Fei\u2019s lips twitched. Damn it. He was a man. He would like it better if he said he was handsome instead of gorgeous. \u201cThank you.\u201dAlthough the food was expensive, it was served fast. After the waiters served the dishes on the table later, Lin frowned and complained, \u201cWhy did you order only some plain vegetables?\u201dMo Fei secretly rolled his eyes. He ordered vegetables and meat. \u201cIt\u2019s good to eat more vegetables.\u201dLin nodded, \u201cYou are right. You are right. I agree. More vegetables.\u201dFive dishes were served. Mo Fei covered her mouth and vomited, \u201cUgh, ugh.\u201dLin Zhong looked at Mo Fei, \u201cAre you all right? Is it anything with the food?\u201dMo Fei shook his head, \u201cI am fine. I am fine. \u201dLin nodded and looked at Mo Fei with suspicion, \u201cAll right then! Let\u2019s start eating.\u201dWhile Mo Fei picked up a piece of meat and put it in his mouth, he vomited again.Lin Zhong looked at Mo Fei, \u201cAre you sure you are all right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine. I haven\u2019t had much appetite lately.\u201d Mo Fei forced a smile.Mo Yi lowered his voice, \u201cYoung master, you should grab a bite. It\u2019s not for you, but for your baby\u2026\u201dMo Fei stared hard at Mo Yi to shush him. Mo Yi stopped talking and hid behind him.Lin Zhong looked at Mo Fei with suspicion. Mo Fei smiled awkwardly, \u201cLin, you eat.\u201dLin laid his eyes on Mo Fei\u2019s belly and even stopped shaking his legs.After having another bite, Mo Fei suddenly puked, followed by a strong sour smell.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t hold it.\u201d Mo Fei apologized to Lin Zhong.Lin stood up and said, \u201cSorry, I remember that I have something to do today. I\u2019d better get going.\u201dLin turned around and ran away quickly.Mo Fei sent a signal to Mo Yi who shouted immediately, \u201cMaster Lin, before you go, pay the bill first!\u201dLin Zhong even ran faster on hearing that.Mo Fei and Mo Yi looked at each other and yelled, \u201cBitch!\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So should we just\u2026 leave without paying?\u201dMo Fei rolled his eyes at Mo Yi, \u201cDo you think you are smarter than I am? This is a gangster restaurant. Look at those strong and tall securities. They will take us down in a second. If we don\u2019t pay, we will end up in hospital, fool.\u201d Medical fee was much higher that the price of a meal.Mo Yi nodded, \u201cYou are so thoughtful.\u201d\u201cSon of a bitch! How dare he run away?! At least we should split the bill.\u201d Mo Fei was outraged.Mo Fei\u2019s heart was bleeding when he paid three thousand star coins at the cashier.As he walked out of the restaurant, Mo Fei turned around and glared at the signboard of the restaurant, \u201cCurse you, bloody restaurant. You will lose every penny someday.\u201d\u201cYoung master, how many star coins you have left?\u201d Mo Yi asked curiously.\u201c250.\u201d Said Mo Fei woebegone morosely.Mo Yi blinked his eyes and said, \u201c250 star coins? Young master, you cannot even afford a bottle of water now.\u201dMo Fei stamped on the floor, \u201cYou tell me! Do you think that I don\u2019t know I am poor now? Go home.\u201dWhen Mo Fei and Mo Yi got home, they sat at the table eating some food.\u201cYoung master, do you think if Lin will cancel the engagement?\u201d Mo Yi asked.Mo Fei nodded and said, \u201cI think he will. No man likes being cheated on.\u201d\u201cBrilliant idea!\u201d Mo Yi sucked him up.\u201cSure it is!\u201d\u201cYoung master, it seems that you are about to be rejected the seventeenth time. Is it really a good thing to be rejected again and again?\u201d Mo Yi asked unsurely.\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault. They are not my type.\u201d He shrugged.\u201cYoung master, what is your type?\u201d Mo Fei asked.\u201cI like the one with curvy figure, pink cheeks, round eyes, rosy lips\u2026 \u201d\u201cYoung master, you are talking about a woman.\u201d Mo Yi was confused.\u201cYes! I like women.\u201d Mo Fei nodded.\u201cBut, young master\u2026 You\u2019ve been given an S potion injection.\u201d Mo Yi frowned.Mo Fei waved his hand and wore a mourning expression, \u201cWhat is gone is gone. Don\u2019t you bring it up ever again.\u201dThe most regretful thing in his life was that he had not transmigrated here earlier. When he transmigrated, the original body owner had just received the S potion injection for a month.On Daybreak Star, men outnumbered women. In order to reproduce, researchers successfully developed S potion which could help men get pregnant.\u201cYoung master! Switch your type. There are so few women these days. Most of them are skinny with flat chest. It is not very easy to find a sexy, hourglass woman.\u201d Mo Fei said.Mo Fei rolled his eyes at Mo Yi, \u201cI am very determined. I won\u2019t change my type very easily. I will certainly realize my life goal- to find a beautiful wife.\u201d\u201cThen you might remain as a bachelor for all your life.\u201d Mo Yi murmured.\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Mo Fei turned to Mo Yi.\u201cI am saying, you will achieve your life goal sooner or later.\u201d Mo Yi said.\u201cYou bet I will.\u201d Mo Fei smiled.\u201cYoung master, before you realize your life goal, shouldn\u2019t we think about what we are gonna eat tomorrow first?\u201d Mo Yi asked.Mo Fei rolled his eyes again, \u201cWe are talking about the ideal of life now.

Aren\u2019t you worried that you may lose your charm?\u201d Mo Yi asked scrupulously.\u201cWhat are you talking about? How can I lose my charm and not be attractive? Let me remind you. Two brothers once fought each other to marry me.\u201d Mo Fei argued.\u201cYes, I do remember.\u201d Mo Yi nodded.A few months ago, Mo Yang intended to arrange a marriage for Mo Fei and the son of Qi Family who owned the East Wind Enterprise. Qi Family had twin sons who looked much alike. The rumor said when they were born, the whole world was at the turmoil of war. When everything got settled down, they couldn\u2019t tell which one was the elder or younger one.When they grew up, they fought several times every month over who was the elder one.When the two families decided to arrange a joint-marriage, the master of the Qi Family \u00a0meant the elder brother should be the one to marry Mo Fei.Both of them considered themselves the elder one. So they both showed up on the date.On that day, Mo Fei painted a red birthmark on his eyes, yellowed his teeth, and sprayed a smelly potion all over his body. The brothers were nearly scared to death.It was said that they had never had a fight over who was the elder one again ever since.\u201cI told you. How could I not be charming? They fought so intensely for me. I heard that they had lied in hospital for a whole month.\u201d Mo Fei smiled proudly.\u201cYes! Yes! You are very charming. I heard they almost killed each other.\u201d Mo Yi nodded.Bang! The door got slammed open.Ann elegant and poised woman stood in the doorway, outraged.Mo Fei gulped down the food in his mouth.\u201cWhat did you do to make Lin Family reject the engagement? You damn bastard!\u201d Lin Xi was furiously glaring at Mo Fei like she was going to strangle him.He smiled awkwardly, \u201cHow would I know? I can\u2019t read his mind.\u201d\u201cI heard you are pregnant?\u201d Lin Xi snorted.\u201cIt is absolute slander. I am still a virgin. How can I possibly be pregnant?!\u201d Mo Fei argued.Lin Xi grinded his tooth, \u201cYou do have a lot of tricks. Pretending to be pregnant? Why don\u2019t you play dead? Wait! As far as I could recall, you have actually done that before. You pretended to have TB on a date! If you want to die, die now, so I can save the food.\u201dAll of a sudden, Mo Fei threw himself at Lin Xi and rubbed his running nose and watering eyes on Lin Xi\u2019s valuable clothes, \u201cDear mother, how can you curse me dead! You\u2019re my beloved mother.\u201dDisgusted by his behavior, Lin Xi stepped backward a few steps and got rid of Mo Fei, \u201cKeep playing your tricks. You like no one. Do you think you are really so attractive?\u201dMo Fei got angry. This damn woman! He was very popular in his previous life. There was a long line out there waiting for his affection. How dare she belittle him!Lin Xin turned around and walked away. Before leaving, she looked back at Mo Fei, \u201cIs it all about Ouyang Qi? You\u2019d better give up. He dumped you long time ago. Your ridiculous behaviors are only jokes in his eyes.\u201dLin Xi strutted away arrogantly with the servants.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why would I be mad?\u201d Mo Fei snorted.Ouyang Qi Lin Xi had just mentioned was a childhood friend of the original Mo Fei. They were engaged since they were young. Unfortunately, when they took the qualification test at the age of 15, Ouyang Qi was found to own A level of physical quality and B level of spiritual quality, while Mo Fei had E level of physical quality and E level of spiritual quality. Ouyang Qi, therefore, cancelled the engagement decidedly.So Mo Fei got S gene injection because of Ouyang Qi. Heartbroken by Ouyang Qi, he committed suicide at a young age. Soon after he killed himself, Mo Fei took over his body.\u201cYoung master, you didn\u2019t mean to take advantage of Her Lady when you threw yourself at her just now, did you?\u201d Mo Yi asked. Although Mrs. Lin had a bad temper, she indeed had a sexy body figure and pretty face, which was exactly Mo Fei\u2019s type.\u201cIs that how you think of me? You think that is my upper limit?\u201d Mo Fei wasn\u2019t happy.\u201cYou are of course ambitious with a bigger picture.\u201d Mo Fei smiled awkwardly.\u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d Mo Fei nodded with a smile.Mo Fei stretched out his palm. A beautiful ornament appeared.Mo Yi was startled with his eyes wide open, \u201cIs it a star core?\u201d\u201cI think so.\u201d replied Mo Fei, nodding his head.On Daybreak Star, there lived Star Beasts which were the old enemy of mankind, but the star core in their bodies could help human with their cultivation.\u201cDid you steal it?\u201d Mo Yi whispered.All of sudden, Mo Yi\u2019s eyes were widely open because he understood everything. The reason why Mo Fei threw himself at Mrs. Lin wasn\u2019t to take advantage of her, but to steal the star core from her.\u201cStealing? That sounds a little harsh. I just borrowed it.\u201d Mo Fei stared at Mo Yi, \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid I am too poor to pay it back later.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Mo Yi nodded.Mo Fei blinked his eyes and said innocently, \u201cDo I have any other choices? The old bitch always deducts my pocket money, and if she hadn\u2019t set me up with such a stingy date, I wouldn\u2019t have spent three thousand star coins on such shitty food?\u201dAccording to family rules, every legitimate child would be given three thousand star coins as pocket money every month. That old witch only gave him one thousand, sometimes even not a penny. The old woman was so mean to Mo Fei though, she was very generous to her own son and daughter. She could spend hundreds of thousands to buy a star car for them.\u201cYoung master, whatever you said is right. This level 3 star core is worthy ten thousand star coins at least!\u201d Mo Yi said.\u201cYou are right. Ten thousand star coins! If the old woman doesn\u2019t arrange any more blind dates, the money should be enough for me to last a few months.\u201d Mo Fei nodded.Mo Fei came from Grandsky Star. Grandsky Star was a place where cultivation and technology co-existed. And both were way much more advanced than that of Daybreak Star.Mo Fei was born in a small cultivation family on Grandsky Star. He loved studying medicine since childhood, and later became an excellent pharmacist. He developed a medicine which could promote people\u2019s cultivation more safely. The news got leaked one day and two forces came to him.Both forces wanted the medicaments prescription. So they had a fight, but Mo Fei was the one who had to take the consequences. His laboratory was turned into ashes while the two forces were fighting each other.People here on Daybreak Star were not good at making potions. However, Mo Fei was able to make potions that were helpful for \u00a0people on this plant to cultivate their star force.Because his previous life ended up very ugly, Mo Fei made up his mind to reveal what he is really capable of only under extremely dangerous situations.There were two more important reasons that he didn\u2019t make potions. One was that he had no proper materials to buy here. Medicinal materials even with low star force were astronomically expensive. However, he had no money at all. Another reason was that even if he had potions, he might not sell it out. To stop people selling quack potions in the market, medicine sellers should have pharmacist\u2019s license and endorsement. Mo Fei had neither of them.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It must be the madam.\u201dMo Fei instantly slipped the pendant into his pocket and said unhurriedly, \u201cEasy. A quiet conscience sleeps in thunder.\u201dMo Yi kind of adored Mo Fei now, thinking, \u201cMo Fei is Mo Fei. He lies though his teeth, just like eating a meal, 0 degree of difficulty.\u201dLin Xi rushed in and glared at Mo Fei like a devil, saying, \u201cTell me. Did you take my pendant?\u201dMo Fei looked at Lin Xi innocently, \u201cPendant? What pendant?\u201d\u201cCome on. Save it!\u201d Lin Xi looked at Mo Fei ruthlessly, \u201cIt must be you who took it from me.\u201dMo Fei then threw himself at Lin Xi, \u201cMy dear mother, although I am not your biological son, how could you slander me as a thief? How am I supposed to show my face before people?\u201dLin Xi dusted off his hands, \u201cDon\u2019t try to deny it. Search him! Now!\u201dMo Fei \u2018s face turned pale with fright, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t!\u201dLin Xi then sneered at Mo Fei, saying, \u201cWhat? You feeling guilty now?\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cYeah! All my used socks were there on my bed for days. I\u2019m afraid they may get your maids choked.\u201d\u201cMadam, we didn\u2019t find it.\u201d The two maids reported awkwardly after rummaging through the whole room.Lin Xi glared at Mo Fei, \u201cIt is on you, right? Is it on your body?\u201dMo Fei blinked at Lin Xi and then said angrily, \u201cMa\u2019am, what makes you say that?\u201d\u201cI bet it\u2019s on your body!\u201d said Lin Xi.Mo Fei then took off his coat, lifting his underwear, exposing his fair-skinned chest.\u201cAh!\u201d The two maids screamed!Mo Fei then raised his tone, \u201cMy dear mother, just tell me if you are sick of my father\u2019s body now. You don\u2019t need to beat around the bush! You are my dear mother. If you ask to see me naked, how could I say no?\u201dAnd when Mo Fei assumed the posture to take off his pants, Lin Xi immediately ran away with her two maids.With the hands on his hips, Mo Fei watched Lin Xi run away, grumbling, \u201cI know I have a perfect body shape. But you don\u2019t need to be so dramatic!\u201dMo Yi looked at Mo Fei, with all question marks on his face.Mo Fei cast a glance at Mo Yi, \u201cWhat? You got a problem?\u201dMo Yi answered awkwardly, \u201cYoung master, it\u2019s cold outside. You\u2019d better put on your clothes first.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cYou are right.\u201dNot long after Mo Fei put on his clothes, two servants came in, \u201cYoung master, your father asks for your presence.\u201dMo Fei raised his eyebrows and forced a smile, \u201cI will be right over.\u201dWatching the servants leave with contemptuous smile on their faces, Mo Fei couldn\u2019t help but mutter, \u201cAn adulterer and a whore!\u201dMo Fei then moved to the hall, where Mo Yang was sitting, \u00a0with his face darkened.\u201cFather.\u201d murmured Mo Fei.\u201cYou are here.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve become more and more reckless now. How could you act so indecently before your mother?\u201d questioned Mo Yang.Mo Fei goggled his eyes and said aloud, \u201cFather, I\u2019m innocent! My mother asked me to take off my clothes. But don\u2019t you worry. I only took off my tops. She didn\u2019t give me time to take off my pants. Beside, even if I got naked, my body shape could never be as great as yours. And even if my mother sleeps with someone other than you, it wouldn\u2019t be me.\u201dMo Yang\u2019s face immediately darkened, and he said, \u201cNonsense!\u201dMo Fei said with an innocent tone, \u201cFather, every word I said is out of my heart. Every word I said is absolutely true, I swear!\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Mo Yang said angrily.On seeing Mo Yang\u2019s expression, Mo Fei immediately shut his mouth.\u201cYang the junior canceled the engagement, do you know that?\u201d asked Mo Yang with resent.\u201cDad, you have no idea how far he has gone. He ran away while we were still eating. And I am the one who had to pay the bills. Besides, the place he picked is goddamn expensive. I don\u2019t think he was there for the blind date. He must be a capper. Yes, he is!\u201d Mo Fei said angrily, with his fists clenched!\u201cShut up! How dare you frame others? It is you who doesn\u2019t want blind dates!\u201d yelled Mo Yang.Mo Fei smiled awkwardly, \u201cFather, you take me wrong. No young man doesn\u2019t long for love. I do want my other half. But I just haven\u2019t found the right one.\u201d\u201cYou little shithead! As average as you are, you\u2019re still so picky? Isn\u2019t Lin the junior good enough for you?

But it was a top kung fu master.\u201d Su Rong said reluctantly.Lou Yu took another deep of breath and pounded the desk, \u201cNever mind. That bitch has made up her mind to tell people that I am a hoodoo of my other half.\u201d\u201cHer Lady has gone too far. As such an outstanding pharmacist, given some time, Miss Ming may have the potential to become a master pharmacist. This is great loss for the empire.\u201d Su Rong knitted his eyebrows.\u201cEmpire? That woman has never cared about the empire at all. What she cares about is whether his son could seat his ass tight on the throne.\u201d Lou Yu said coldly.\u201cPrince, Her Lady\u2026she\u2026\u201dLou Yu looked at Su Rong and said, \u201cJust spit it out.

How bad?\u201dSu Rong said awkwardly, \u201cAccording to the Star website, this guy is ugly, good-for-nothing, short-lived, a freak, with no morals, and shameless and\u2026\u201dLou Yu frowned, with his face turning deathly pale, and then snorted, \u201cOur Noble Consort really has cudgeled her brain to disgust me.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, that person has been rejected of the engagement 17 times!\u201d Said Su Rong.Lou Yu frowned, \u201c17 times?

This time you are engaged with Prince Yu! The widely-known third prince of the empire!\u201d\u201cYou mean that Prince Yu wants to marry me?\u201d\u201cExactly, young master, Prince Yu wants to marry you!\u201d\u201cHell no! Is he out of his mind? Even if woman is a rare species now, as the prince, he could have a chance to marry one. Is it because he got excluded, or maybe he has sexual impotence, so he could only marry a man?\u201d asked Mo Fei with his brows knitted.\u201cPrince Yu is charming, majestic, endowed with civil and martial virtues, and also in perfect health.\u201d\u201cOh, since he is so good, why would he marry me?\u201d\u201cHe is good in every aspect, but only a hoodoo of his other half. Three of his fianc\u00e9es died in succession. You know, there\u2019re not many women in our empire nowadays.\u201d\u201cThree? Then if I marry him, I will be the fourth.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, young master. It\u2019s never gonna happen.\u201d\u201cWhy is that?\u201d\u201cBecause your life is tougher than his.\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cOf course.

Those with compatible jimbook can not suppress him at all. So they could only take the opposite approach.\u201d Mo Yi moved forward and said.\u201cSo just because our jimbooks are incompatible?\u201d doubted Mo Fei.\u201cMaybe also because of your reputation out there.\u201d Mo Yi echoed.\u201dMo Fei raised his eyebrows, asking: \u201cReputation? Am I quite famous?\u201d\u201cOf course. Young master, you\u2019re far-famed.\u201d Mo Yi said.Mo Fei showed some interest, \u201cReally?

There must be a scheme behind this.\u201dMo Yi felt embarrassed, \u201cYoung master, you should consider about it. After all it\u2019s Prince Yu! It is a now-or-never thing.\u201d\u201cPrince Yu? Is he very outstanding?\u201d asked Mo Fei.Mo Yi nodded, \u201cSure! Of course! Even though three women died because of him, there are still a long line of women out there wanting to marry him.\u201dMo Fei rubbed his chin again, \u201cSomething is not right. I bet Prince Yu should\u2019ve been brought up by his stepmother.\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cYoung master, you are so smart. He is brought up by his stepmother. And it\u2019s said this marriage is also arranged by her\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Yi looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cYoung master, this time don\u2019t you never ever try to scare him away.\u201dMo Fei raised his head and looked at Mo Yi, \u201cIt seems you are quite interested in him. You like him?\u201dMo Yi forced a smile, \u201cYoung master, how could I have the guts to snatch a man from you? I mean, a lean camel is bigger than a horse. Even Prince Yu is not the favored one, he is still a prince after all. Think about the betrothal presents! Young master, recently we could barely afford any food, you know.\u201dThey could have made a fast buck to sell Lin Yi\u2019s jewelries.

This is like kind of insult to him!\u201d Mo Yuwei complained.\u201cLou Yu, the third prince! Physique, S class, spiritual power, S class. How would Mo Fei, that son of bitch, be picked by him? What does Prince Yu see in him?\u201d thought Mo Yuwei.Lin Xi frowned, thinking, \u201cThat son of bitch has refused one after another. I was wondering what kind he would marry to. And now even Prince Yu has proposed to him.\u201dLin Xi said bitterly, \u201cThe Noble Consort arranged all this. I also can\u2019t do anything.\u201dMo Yuwei frowned, \u201cThis is not right!\u201dTheir Mo family had been occupied in mecha parts business. They only had one company under their name, which was beyond common\u2019s people\u2019s reach. But it was nothing in the royal family\u2019s eyes at all.With her brows knitted, Lin Xi said, \u201cI heard three of Prince Yu\u2019s fianc\u00e9es died because he was a hoodoo of his other half. The Crown Princess had people checked the citizen information registration data and found that Mo Fei and the third prince are perfectly matched.\u201dMo Yuwei frowned, \u201cIs there something with the Noble Consort\u2019 brain? How is it possible Mo Fei is perfectly matched with the prince?\u201dLin Yu frowned, \u201cDon\u2019t jump to the conclusion.\u201dMo Yuwei could only shut her mouth. Royal family was not someone they should gossip about.Mo Yi suddenly pushed the door open, looking quite excited, which startled Mo Fei who was trying to steal some food to eat.\u201cYoung master, young master, you become famous.\u201dMo Fei peeped at him sideways, \u201cBecome famous? Haven\u2019t I always been famous?\u201d\u201cYoung master, you were famous in quite a small scope. But this time you become really famous.\u201d said Mo Yi with his eyes shining.Mo Fei showed some interest, \u201cReally?\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cYeah. On Star website, people are all talking about you.\u201dMo Fei clicked open a post named \u201cPrince Yu\u2019s Fourth Fianc\u00e9e\u201d.And then a scary photo jumped into their eyes.\u201cWow! Who is this ugly?\u2019 It gave Mo Fei a jump scare.\u201cYoung master, that\u2019s you. Did you forget six months ago, you used this \u201ccross eyes and deviated nose\u201d look to scare away your fifth fianc\u00e9?\u201d Mo Yi said.\u201cOh! This host is really resourceful. He has investigated the background of all my seventeen ex fianc\u00e9s. This isn\u2019t an easy job. Good for him.\u201d Mo Fei praised.\u201cYeah, right. Every detail of them.

Remember to buy me a Zhilin cake when you are back.\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cI know, young master.\u201d\u2026\u201cSon of bitch! Asshole! What a low life\u2026\u201d Lin Xi looked furious.Seeing her mom fly into a rage, Mo Yuwei asked, \u201cMother, what happened?\u201d\u201cLast time I lost a pendant at Mo Fei\u2019s place. He said it wasn\u2019t him. But today his servant pawned it. Does he really take me as a fool?\u201d Lin Xi said angrily.\u201cMother, won\u2019t you go denounce him?\u201d asked Mo Yuwei.Lin Xi said resentfully, \u201cHis status is different now. We can\u2019t make trouble for him as we wanted like before.\u201dMo Yuwei still wouldn\u2019t give up, \u201cBut the Prince Yu hasn\u2019t agreed to marry him.\u201d\u201cThen still no.\u201d said Lin Xi.At this sensitive period, she couldn\u2019t make a tiny mistake. Mo Fei might also have predicted this, so he would be bold enough to pawn her pendant to disgust her.She\u2019d like to see whether this son of bitch would really secure the position as the crown princess.\u201cYoung master, your Zhilin cake.\u201d said Mo Yi.Mo Fei rubbed his hands while staring at the cake before him amorously, \u201cCake, dear cake! I missed you so much! Finally you are here. Prince Yu? Crown princess? They are nothing compared with you. I love you the most. I have waited for you for too long, you know?\u201dMo Yi\u2019s face got stiff, \u201cYoung master, when I bought the cake for you, I encountered the Madam\u2019s people.\u201dMo Fei cast at glance at him, \u201cSo what? I don\u2019t give it a shit. How was your performance anyway?\u201d\u201cI kept your words firmly in mind.

Of course you should go! That\u2019s Prince Yu! So many people out there are willing to spend millions of star coins to see him in person.\u201d said Mo Yi athrill.\u201cSpending millions only to see him in person? That\u2019s what those silly rich people would do. I am poor and smart. I won\u2019t do that.\u201d said Mo Fei while waving his hands.Mo Yi shrugged, \u201cYoung master, it\u2019s Prince Yu. At least show some courtesy.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cI also think it that way. But, I\u2019m a little worried.\u201dMo Yi asked curiously, \u201cYoung master, what are you worried about? You\u2019re afraid Prince Yu won\u2019t settle on you?\u201dMo Fei cast a glance at him, and said angrily, \u201cI am so cute, such an eye candy. Do you think I will worry about such boring thing? What concerns me is that the food at Gourmet Workshop is very expensive. What should I do if he doesn\u2019t pay?\u201dMo Yi rubbed his nose, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. He is the prince. He is rich.\u201dMo Fei raised his eyebrows, saying, \u201cHe may be rich, but it doesn\u2019t mean he is not stingy.\u201dAfter calculating its gain and loss, they still decided he should go.\u201cMo Yi, what kind of person do you think Prince Yu would be?\u201d asked Mo Fei with his head tilted.Mo Yi touched his chin and said, \u201cI think Prince Yu should be a serious, bland and short-spoken man.\u201d\u201cShort-spoken?\u201d Doubted Mo Fei.Mo Yi nodded, \u201cYeah. I heard Prince Yu doesn\u2019t talk much, and has a bad attitude toward beauties. But with that unapproachable attitude, there are still numerous pretty women who would throw themselves on him.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cBeautiful women all have a bad taste. So, as outstanding as I am, there would be no woman going after me.\u201dMo Yi twitched his face, speechlessMo Fei cast a glance at him, \u201cWhat is that expression for?\u201dMo Yi immediately forced a big smile, \u201cI mean, you are absolutely quite right, young master.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cOf course. Every word I say makes sense.\u201dAfter getting themselves dressed up, Mo Fei and Mo Yi went to the Gourmet Workshop. Since Prince Yu said it should be personal, Mo Fei didn\u2019t tell anyone about this.According the message Prince Yu sent him, Mo Fei went into a balcony, in which sat a young man wearing a black jacket.That young man looked at Mo Fei and spitted out a few words indifferently, \u201cYou are late.\u201dMo Fei forced a smile, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dMo Fei got goose bumps all over by that young man\u2019s cold eyes. Late? He was only 1 minute and twenty seconds late! This guy was so petty.That young man looked at Mo Fei spookily, \u201cYou are prettier that I thought.\u201d\u201cYou flatter me.\u201d Mo Fei gave a hollow laugh.The young man said unhurriedly, \u201cDon\u2019t take it as a compliment. The reason why I said so is because I heard you are extremely ugly. But in my view, you are ordinary looking at most.\u201dMo Fei turned to Mo Yi, frowning, like he was saying, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say this guy is short-spoken?\u201dMo Yi forced a smile at him, and gave him a \u201crumor sucks\u201d look.\u201cDo you have anything to say?\u201d asked Lou Yu.Mo Fei blurted it out without thinking, \u201cPrince Yu, you are so talkative!\u201dLou Yu made a pause and then said, \u201cI\u2019ll take it as a compliment.\u201dMo Fei laughed, \u201cOf course it is.\u201dLou Yu then snorted.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My guess is confirmed. He should have kind of unspoken disease.\u201d\u201cThere is one I need you to know.\u201d said Lou Yu.Mo Fei nodded and tried to cooperate, \u201cShoot, just shoot.

How could I be happy about it? You are so charming, so dignified. I feel so down on thinking that I will never have a chance to have body intimacy with you after we get married.\u201dLooking at his hypocritical expression, Lou Yu snorted, \u201cYou still can\u2019t get over your first love Ouyang Qi, right?\u201dWith the head down, Mo Fei thought to himself, \u201cWhy would I even think of that guy? He is not into men at all. Besides, he is an asshole.\u201dLou Yu took Mo Fei\u2019s silence as an affirmative answer, so he sneered, \u201cYou really have a bad taste on your other half.\u201dHis words immediately provoked him. How dare this little shithead doubt his taste?But he still tried to restrain himself and heaved a sigh, \u201cMy prince, there\u2019s something you don\u2019t know. First love is the best thing in life. Even if you are more handsome and have higher talent than him, so what? In my heart, he is always the best. As excellent as you, you are still no better even\u2026than a finger of his\u2026\u201d On second thought, he changed toe to finger, in case Prince Yu got mad at him.Lou Yu looked at Mo Fei coldly, \u201cSuch a spoony! Pity that he has already thrown himself into someone else\u2019s arms.\u201d\u201cI never expected anything from him.

I really didn\u2019t see that in you.\u201dMo Fei sighed slightly, \u201cHe dumped me, but I still can\u2019t get over him. For him, I have rejected 16 marriages\u201dSome kind of jealous feeling aroused in Lou Yu\u2019s heart, \u201cSince you have rejected sixteen men already, why not reject me?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you won\u2019t touch me?\u201d said Mo Fei while looking at him with that pair of innocent eyes.Lou Yu sneered, \u201cSo you are gonna preserve your integrity for him.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cI don\u2019t want to have sex with someone else now. Maybe someday I can get over him. But you can trust me, my prince. I will never touch you.\u201dLou Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s be great, I think. We\u2019ll get engaged in half a month.\u201d said Lou Yu.Mo Fei said shyly, \u201cWell, you decide.\u201dWhen Lou Yu got up and was about to leave, Mo Fei quickly said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to pay the check.\u201dLou Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He is finally gone. He is cute, so what? Look at that cocky face! Hum!\u201d said Mo Fei flatly.Mo Yi blinked and said, \u201cYoung master, I never know you love Ouyang so deeply. So you rejected all those sixteen marriages because of him!\u201dMo Fei cast a glance at him, \u201cWho told you that? If that tigress finds me a beautiful woman with a curvy figure, I will immediately say yes. But see what that tigress introduced me, huh? A bunch of ugly men! How am I supposed to marry any of them?\u201dMo Fei said with his head titled, \u201cThen why did you say that to Prince Yu?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like him. So I want to make him jealous.\u201d Mo Fei rubbed his nose while saying so.Mo Yi said with a pair of worshipful eyes, \u201cYoung master, that is Prince Yu. You have my knees.\u201d\u201cOf course, I deserve your knees. Who am I? Huh? Get me a glass of water to rinse my mouth. I said too many mushy words today. I got me goose bumps all over.\u201d said Mo Fei drowsily.Mo Yi immediately handed him a glass of water.At this time, a waiter knocked at the door and walked in.Mo Fei blinked and then asked him, \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d\u201cHello, sir. You have spent 23,488 star coins in total. Could you please pay the bills now?\u201d said the waiter.Mo Fei popped his eyes out, \u201cWhat did you say? Didn\u2019t someone pay the check just now?\u201d\u201cA mister told me you will pay the bills.\u201d answered the waiter with a bright smile.Mo Fei said with his eyes wide open, wearing a ferocious expression, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dMo Yi threw himself at him and pressed his shoulder, \u201cYoung master, calm down. Calm down.\u201dMo Fei took a deep breath, and watched his over twenty thousand star coins transferred from his own account, with his heart bleeding.Once the waiter was gone, Mo Fei immediately lost his hair, \u201cAsshole! Motherfucker!\u201dMo Yi looked at Mo Fei awkwardly, \u201cYoung master, calm down. I think, maybe because he is jealous.\u201d\u201cHe is jealous, so I have to pay for it?\u201d Mo Fei took a beer and started to guzzle sullenly. He drank too fast and got himself choked, then said with a sobbing tone with watery eyes, \u201cI knew men are all untrustworthy!\u201dMo Yi scratched his head and said, \u201cYoung master, you are also a man.\u201d\u201cSo, I am also untrustworthy!\u201d said Mo Fei with emotion.Mo Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Fei looked at his star card and started to weep, \u201cI cracked my brain to save some money and now all wasted on a jerk again!?\u201dLou Yu took off his jacket and plopped it on the couch.Su Rong looked at Lou Yu with his eyebrows raised, \u201cMy prince, what\u2019s going on? Isn\u2019t everything smooth?\u201dLou Yu shook his head, \u201cYes, without a hitch.\u201dLou Yu clenched his fists. He never knew he couldn\u2019t even compare with a finger of a heartbreaker!

This felt so awful\u2026Su Rong was a little confused, \u201cSince everything is so smooth, why do you look a little upset?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m happy. Of course I am happy. Nothing could upset me.\u201d said Lou Yu coldly while goggling at Su Rong.Su Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dBut on thinking of the scene that Mo Fei paid the bills, Lou Yu felt a little complacent with his lips curled up.Watching that weird smile on Lou Yu\u2019s face, Su Rong shivered subconsciously.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: Old FlameMo Fei was lying on bed, staring at the ceiling blankly.Seeing Mo Fei was a little abstracted, Mo Yi said, \u201cYoung master, don\u2019t be sad.\u201dMo Fei glanced at him and said with a piteous tone, \u201cHow could I not be? Finally I have been in easy circumstances, and now I\u2019m bankrupt again! Why do I always meet assholes?\u201dMo Yi said awkwardly, \u201cYoung master, Mr. Ouyang invites you for dinner.\u201dMo Fei jumped out of his skin, \u201cDon\u2019t you never ever tell me someone invites me for dinner! Those assholes, they all said they would treat me for dinner, but none of them paid.\u201dMo Yi felt so sorry for him, \u201cThen you\u2019d better not go.\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d Mo Fei said grumpily.Mo Yi mumbled, \u201cYoung master, we are hard up for cash recently. I\u2019m afraid we can only live on the nutrient doses. And finally Mr. Ouyang invites you to dinner, maybe\u2026\u201dMo Fei hesitated for a bit and said, \u201cGo tell Ouyang Qi. I\u2019ll go as long as he is gonna pay.\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cOK.\u201dAt Prince Yu\u2019s mansionLou Yu looked at Su Rong and asked, \u201cWhat? Is there any problem with this Mo Fei?\u201dSu Rong said, \u201cThere should be nothing between Mo Fei and the Imperial Consort. He has ill talent and is not the favored one at home. He is just a nobody judging for every aspect. And he enjoys very bad reputation. The reason the Imperial Consort chooses him is to disgust you.\u201dLou Yu nodded, \u201cI got it. As long as he has nothing to do with that woman.\u201dHe kind of felt that Su Rong was always dodging his eyes.So he asked, \u201cIs there anything you are hiding from me?\u201dSu Rong glanced at Lou Yu and said, \u201cThis Mo Fei is a little misbehaving himself. He has been engaged with you but still is still seeing someone else.\u201dLou Yu\u2019s face darkened, \u201cYou mean Ouyang Qi?\u201dSu Rong nodded, \u201cYeah. Ouyang Qi should\u2019ve been aware that you are engaged, but still asked Mo Fei out. I got the surveillance video. Would you like to take a look?\u201dLou Yu nodded, \u201cSure, why not?\u201d He wondered what the guy Mo Fei had said he couldn\u2019t even compare with a finger of his was like.Su Rong looked at Lou Yu strangely. In his eyes, Prince Yu is an indifferent person. So he shouldn\u2019t show any concerns about such a nobody.Su Rong then took out a tiny video player, played the video on the wall with a projector. It was in a balcony, in which were seated a handsome young man.Mo Fei opened the door and went in with Mo Yi.On Seeing Mo Fei, Ouyang Qi who was sitting in the balcony immediately wore a cocky smile, \u201cI knew you\u2019d come.\u201dMo Fei sat on the opposite side of Ouyang Qi drowsily, \u201cSomeone treats me for dinner. Give me a reason to say no.\u201d\u201cFei, I know you are still mad at me. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to cancel the engagement, my family forced me to.\u201d There was kind of downcast expression on Ouyang Qi\u2019s face.Mo Fei blinked and ignored Ouyang Qi\u2019s guilty expression, but said in a serious tone, \u201cSo, you have paid for this, right?\u201dOuyang Qi\u2019s face went stiff by Mo Fei\u2019s question, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201dMo Fei nodded and heaved a long sigh, \u201cThen I am relieved.\u201dOuyang Qi, \u201cFei, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201dMo Fei nodded and said seriously, \u201cI\u2019m glad that you feel sorry for me. So how much are you gonna pay for my mental damage?\u201dOuyang Qi\u2019s face went stiff again, \u201cFei, since when have you become so material?\u201dMo Fei said while gulping the food, \u201cI\u2019m kind of strapped for cash recently. What choice do I have?\u201d\u201cFei, I know you still have feelings for me. Actually, I also have never forgotten about you. You\u2019re still my only love.\u201d Said Ouyang Qi amorously.Mo Fei covered his mouth, pretending he was gonna throw up.Mo Yi got startled and immediately came before him, \u201cYoung master, hold it! These dishes are very expensive. It\u2019s a shame if you throw up.\u201dOn hearing Mo Yi\u2019s words, Mo Fei popped his eyes out and swallowed up the food in his mouth with efforts.Ouyang Qi\u2019s face turned all dark.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: Who Is Better?Ouyang Qi adjusted the expression on his face and said, \u201cFei, I know you still have feelings for me.\u201dMo Fei shook his head and said earnestly, \u201cYou take me wrong. I don\u2019t like you at all now.\u201dOuyang Qi ignored his words and went on, \u201cFei, why can\u2019t admit that you still have me in your heart. If it hadn\u2019t been me, you would never have turned down so many pursuers.\u201dMo Fei looked at him with his eyes wide open, \u201cDon\u2019t be so self-involved. I didn\u2019t do that for you.\u201dOiyang Qi looked at Mo Fei, heaving a sigh, \u201cFei, Prince Yu isn\u2019t suitable for you.\u201dMo Fei smiled, with kind of contempt on his face, \u201cThen who is suitable for me? You?\u201dOuyang Qi forced a smile, \u201cIf\u2026I mean if you want, we can start over.\u201dMo Fei frowned and said impatiently, \u201cYou should be clear that Prince Yu owns S class constitution, S class spiritual power. Do you really think I would give up on such an outstanding man for you? Before him, you are nothing. What the fuck do you think you are? You know how handsome Prince Yu is? Do you know how powerful he is? Do you know how wealthy he is? You can not even compare with a toe of his.\u201dOuyang looked quite embarrassed. He then looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cEvery aspect of Prince Yu is perfect. But, he will never fall for you!\u201dMo Fei frowned, \u201cThat\u2019s between us. It\u2019s nothing of your business.\u201d\u201cFei, the imperial family is too complicated. Once you step in, you will be doomed.\u201d Ouyang Qi tried to talk him out of it.Mo Fei said coldly, \u201cDon\u2019t you bother.\u201dThe imperial family was indeed very complicated. But since he had already been involved, he could only go with the stream. It was easy to cancel any other\u2019s engagement, but not Prince Yu\u2019s. Otherwise, there\u2019d be no place for him on this planet.Ouyang Qi said while staring at his poker face, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I should really stay out of it.\u201dWatching Ouyang Qi walk away, Mo Yi said, \u201cYoung master, Mr. Ouyang has gone.\u201d\u201cGood. Anyway he has paid. We can enjoy more food each now.\u201d Mo Fei said triumphantly.Mo Yi then started to gabble on the opposite side of Mo Fei, \u201cYoung master, you said Prince Yu can not compare with a finger of Mr. Ouyang the other day, and now you said Mr. Ouyang can\u2019t even compare with a toe of Prince Yu. So, in your eyes, who of them two is better?\u201dMo Fei then got goose bumps on hearing him, \u201cOne is a heartbreaker while the other is a niggard. Both suck!\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cYou are right.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, since Ouyang Qi treats us such a big meal, this guy isn\u2019t all bad, while Prince Yu, that son of bitch, invited us to such a fancy restaurant but didn\u2019t pay.\u201d Then Mo Fei started to chow down.Mo Yi nodded, \u201cYoung master, in my opinion, be it Ouyang or Prince Yu, neither of them can\u2019t compare with a hair on your head.\u201dMo Fei raised his head, \u201cYeah, yeah, you have way wider vision than Ouyang Qi and Prince Yu.\u201dMo Yi smiled implicitly, \u201cYou flattered me, young master. How can I compare with them?\u201dThe expression on Lou Yu\u2019s face kept changing while he was watching the surveillance video.Seeing the expression on Lou Yu\u2019s face, Su Rong said, \u201cPrince Yu, your fianc\u00e9e is kind of special.\u201d\u201cYeah, very special.\u201d Lou Yu nodded.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When Lou Yu saw the message, there was kind of warm feeling in his eyes.Su Rong looked at him, asking, \u201cMy prince, who is it?\u201d\u201cMy grandpa. He asked me to see him.\u201d said Lou Yu.On hearing that, Su Rong\u2019s expression immediately loosened up. Lou Yu\u2019s grandpa Ji Anguo was Lou Yu\u2019s biggest backstage supporter. If he hadn\u2019t suffered from the sequelae after having gotten badly injured in a war, it would never be the Imperial Consort\u2019s turn to be in power. Though the old general got badly injured, he still had his remaining influence. Otherwise, the Imperial Consort would have gone even further.Lou Yu frowned, thinking, \u201cHe asked me to his place at this time. It should be about my marriage stuff.\u201dOnce Lou Yu stepped into the general\u2019s mansion, he saw a green old man.\u201cYou are here.\u201d said Ji Anguo with his hands clasped behind the back.Lou Yu nodded, \u201cYeah. Grandpa, are you all right?\u201dJi Anguo pretended to be angry, \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201dLou Yu smiled awkwardly, \u201cGrandpa, I\u2019m glad you are all right.\u201dJi Anguo looked at Lou Yu, showing kind of concerns in his eyes, \u201cI heard that woman has set you up with someone who has been backed out of marriage 17 times and even is pregnant. That woman has gone too far. She just wants to humiliate you!\u201dLou Yu smiled gently, \u201cGrandpa, don\u2019t be angry. Actually that person is kind of good.\u201dJi Anguo felt kind of weird since Lou Yu wasn\u2019t so disgusted with that person, \u201cKind of good? So you have already met each other?\u201dLou Yu nodded, \u201cYeah. I think we kinda quite hit it off.\u201dJi Anguo looked at Lou Yu surprisingly, \u201cAs long as you like.\u201dLou Yu forced a smile, \u201cYeah, I think that person is good.\u201dNow Ji Anguo smiled with contentment, \u201cThat person should be extremely good since that person even got my grandson\u2019s approving.\u201dLou Yu smiled awkwardly, thinking, \u201cExtremely good? Hell no!\u201dAt Mo Family\u201cYoung master, great news, great new!\u201d Mo Yi rushed in.Mo Fei asked with his eyebrows raised, \u201cWhat great news?\u201d\u201cYou and Prince Yu\u2019s marriage has been nailed. The imperial family has officially issued the announcement. Young master, you know what that means?\u201dAfter thinking carefully for some time, Mo Fei answered, \u201cThat means the hot chicks who want to take me down on Star website has tripled, or even more. To be cared about by beautiful women is a pleasant thing. But to be cursed to die by so many beautiful women is a pretty sad thing!\u201dOn seeing Mo Fei\u2019s sad expression, Mo Yi tried to comfort him, \u201cYoung master, don\u2019t be so negative. There would be beautiful women out there wishing you and Prince Yu grow old together.\u201dMo Fei glared at Mo Yi coldly, \u201cI don\u2019t need them to wish me and that penny pincher to grow old together. I want them to throw themselves on me!\u201dMo Yi then blinked the eyes, thinking, \u201cThat\u2019s kind of too difficult.\u201dIn Mo Yang\u2019s studyLin Xi frowned, and complained while looking at Mo Yang, \u201cYou want to offer Skyriver Company as Mo Fei\u2019s dowry?\u201dMo Yang nodded, \u201cYes.\u201dSkyriver was a small company developing potions under the name of Mo Family. Since the price of potions had kept all-time high, Mo Yang also wanted to have a finger in the pie.Pity that the prescriptions were in the hands of those big companies. The medicinal herbs were very expensive, plus the last few pharmacists Mo Yang had hired all had grandiose aims but puny abilities. Since Skyriver had been established, it had only developed some little-used lower potions and been losing money every year.Lin Xie frowned. Skyriver had been losing money every year, but they had input quite a lot of money into it. It could be sold at the price of seven or eight million at least.\u201cBut we have invested too much into it!\u201d Said Lin Xi.Mo Yang nodded, \u201cI know. But Mo Fei is going to marry Prince Yu! How can we let him marry the prince empty-handed? That\u2019s an insult to the prince!\u201dLin Xi hesitated, \u201cBut I heard Prince Yu is not the favored one. Otherwise the Imperial Consort wouldn\u2019t betroth our son to him.\u201dMo Yang heaved a sigh slightly, \u201cI know, but even if Prince Yu is not the favored one, he is the one we cannot afford to offend. Besides, the one behind Prince Yu is General Ji Anguo!\u201d Ji Anguo had made great military exploits for the country. His hands were full of blood!Lin Xi clenched her hands tightly, with all discontent in her eyes. She had always wanted to embarrass Mo Fei. But in the end, by the stroke of luck, that jerk was going to marry Prince Yu and Mo Yang even meant to offer a company as his dowry!If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Your father has no choice.\u201dMo Yuwei pulled her face and said sullenly, \u201cHe isn\u2019t good enough for Prince Yu in every way.

No one can change it.\u201d\u2026Mo Yi moved by the ear of Mo Fei and whispered a lot, blahblahblah\u2026Mo Fei\u2019s eyes suddenly shone, \u201cYou mean that old man is handing Skyriver over to me?\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cYes, exactly!\u201dMo Fei rubbed his chin, \u201cThat old man still has a little consciousness. Though that company has been losing money all year round, at least it\u2019s a company.\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s for Prince Yu\u2019s sake, I heard.\u201dMo Fei smiled with his brows raised, \u201cTold ya. Prince Yu actually is way better that Ouyang Qi. Forget about other things, even Prince Yu\u2019s face is much more worthy that Ouyang\u2019s.\u201d Mo Fei thought, if the one he was going to marry was not Prince Yu, Lin Xi the bitch would definitely kick him out empty handed.\u201d\u201cRight! Prince Yu is much more handsome than Ouyang Qi.\u201d sucked up Mo Yi.Mo Fei said while rubbing his own face, \u201cIf I were as handsome as Prince Yu, I would make a living by prostitution, and I will be super rich!\u201dBang! The door got kicked open.Mo Fei and Mo Yi raised their heads at the same time and looked at the man at the door.Seeing Lou Yu\u2019s sullen face, Mo Fei immediately put on a shining smile, \u201cPrince Yu! What brings you here? We were talking about you\u2026in a nice way\u2026I mean.\u201d\u201cIn a nice way? To make money by selling my body?\u201d questioned Lou Yu coldly.Mo Fei forced a smile, \u201cActually I was trying to say you look handsome.\u201dLou Yu took out a suite from his Space Ring and threw it at Mo Fei, \u201cHere! The wedding costume! Three days later, the wedding car will come pick you up.\u201dLou Yu cast a glance at Mo Fei scornfully, snorted and then walked away.Mo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Yi watched Liu Yu fade away and frowned, \u201cYoung master, Prince Yu just left like that? He even didn\u2019t take a seat.\u201dMo Fei sneered, \u201cGood for him!

This is humiliating! He is the prince! He\u2019s only sent a box of level 1 Star Grass as the betrothal gifts? Is he trying to insult us?\u201dFor ordinary people, level 1 Star Herbs may be valuable enough. But for a big family like them, it was nothing at all. This box of Star Herbs was only worthy of 20 to 30 thousand star coins at most. Did Prince Yu take them as beggars?Mo Yang frowned, \u201cThis marriage has been arranged by the Imperial Consort. I guess Prince Yu also isn\u2019t satisfied with it. So he has sent such little betrothal gifts to show his discontent!\u201dLin Xi waved her handkerchief, \u201cIt\u2019s all Mo Fei\u2019s fault. If he could have been married earlier, it wouldn\u2019t end up like this.\u201dMo Yang nodded, \u201cI guess so!\u201d It\u2019d be a good thing if Prince Yu could take a shelter for him after they get married.

No one fixes up such a perfect match, while I have to marry that Prince Yu\u2026\u201dMo Yi looked a little worried, \u201cYoung master, since Prince Yu is so petty, I\u2019m afraid our days there won\u2019t be good.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cYes, you are right. We should figure it out.\u201dMo Yi looked quite serious, \u201cYeah! If we don\u2019t make a plan earlier, Prince Yu would starve us to death, I\u2019m afraid. I heard the price in the imperial capital is very high!\u201dMo Fei\u2019s face turned pale with fright, \u201cYes, yes. As handsome and cheesy as I am, it\u2019d be a shame to be starved to death.\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cYes, yes, young master, you have to figure it out!\u201dMo Fei rubbed his chin, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go check his betrothal gifts. I\u2019m afraid my dad won\u2019t want them. So I can take them.\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cOK. I\u2019ll go to see whether I can sneak them out.\u201dMo Fei narrowed his eyes, thinking, \u201cPrince Yu is kind of not bad. If he sends some valuable things, my dad and that damn woman would appropriate to themselves. And now it\u2019s only some cheap stuff, so I could have a chance to take them.\u201dLater Mo Yi took the whole box of medicinal herbs to his place.Mo Fei squatted beside the box. After checking, he shook his head, \u201cSo many herbs all belong to level 1. Not even a level 2.\u201dMo Yi smiled, \u201cAnyway it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201dMo Fei nodded. During the past year since his transmigration, he had kept cultivating his star power. Pity he had made very slow progress due to his weak body. He had not even advanced to level 1 star magician. Mo Fei also had ever thought to cultivate with the help of potions. Pity that he had always been cash-strapped, plus he had to deal with so many fianc\u00e9s. He really had no extra energy.Mo Fei narrowed his eyes, thinking, \u201cI have to strengthen my power quickly. Otherwise, if I get involved into the fight of the imperial family, I\u2019d be dead meat.\u201dAll this year he had been practicing Wanmu Sutra Formula for his body conditioning, so his physical quality had improved a lot. With the help of potions, it wouldn\u2019t be a hard thing to become a level 1 star magician. Mo Fei glanced at the level 1 Star Herbs in the box, with his lips curled up. Although Prince Yu only sent some level 1 Star Herbs, they nearly covered all kinds.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: Lin FeiyuLou Yu sat in his star car blandly, while Su Rong looked at him and asked gingerly, \u201cMy prince, is it appropriate to send such little betrothal gifts?\u201dLou Yu caught a glimpse of Su Rong and asked, \u201cSo you think it\u2019s inappropriate?\u201dSu Rong forced a smile, \u201cNo, I mean, of course not.\u201dLou Yu snorted, thinking, \u201cThat Mo Fei was talking about making a living by prostitution with Mo Yi! That son of bitch! He shouldn\u2019t even have sent that box of Star Herbs. He should have sent him only one straw to humiliate him!\u201dLooking at Lou Yu\u2019s gnashing expression, Su Rong asked out of curiosity, \u201cMy prince, is there something wrong between you and the crown princess?\u201d\u201cCome on. What could go wrong between us?\u201d said Lou Yu blandly.Su Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cA-choo!\u201d Mo Fei rubbed his nose and muttered to himself, \u201cSome hot chick must be missing me.\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019s Prince Yu.\u201d said Mo Yi.Mo Fei glanced at Mo Yi and said, \u201cDon\u2019t mention that niggard before me. It makes me mad. I have never seen someone bitchier than him. Look at those herbs. Most of the rootstocks are damaged. He only sent me a box of lower level herbs, a box of rejects! He deserves to go to hell!\u201dA star car was speeding along the road and drove all the way before Prince Yu\u2019s mansion. Su Rong found someone who shouldn\u2019t appear here.After getting out the car, Lou Yu\u2019s face darkened on seeing Lin Feiyu.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d asked Lou Yu.Lin Feiyu looked at Lou Yu innocently, \u201cLou Yu, I\u2019m here to visit you.\u201dSu Rong frowned while looking at Lin Feiyu. Lin Feiyu was Lou Yu\u2019s childhood sweetheart. Lou Yu had taken care of Lin Feiyu since he was young. Lin Feiyu\u2019s physique belonged to level B, spiritual power level S, quite suitable to be a pharmacist. In fact, Lin Feiyu was indeed a potion talent. At such a young age, he could already make level 3 potions.Su Rong was Lou Yu\u2019s trustedfollower. Of course he knew Lou Yu had feelings for Lin Feiyu. Pity that Lin Feiyu only took him as a good friend. The one he loved was Lou Yu\u2019s elder brother Lou Feng.Lou Yu nodded, \u201cThank you for coming all the way to see me.\u201dLin Feiyu raised his head and looked at Lou Yu, \u201cBrother Lou Yu, they said you are getting married.\u201dLou Yu nodded, \u201cYes, the wedding will be held in three days.\u201d\u201cBrother Lou Yu, if you don\u2019t like your fianc\u00e9e, you just cancel it. Your fianc\u00e9e isn\u2019t good enough for you at all. Brother Lou Yu, you deserve someone better. Don\u2019t give up on yourself since I turned you down.\u201d said Lou Yu while looking at Lou Yu.Lou Yu made no comment of his words but said instead, \u201cMo Fei is good.\u201dLin Feiyu looked at Lou Yu, kind of surprised, frowning, \u201cBut I heard he is pregnant, and as tight as a drum, double-dealing. Brother Lou Yu, Mo Fei is really a terrible person. Don\u2019t be fooled.\u201d\u201cHe ain\u2019t that bad.\u201d Lou Yu then thought to himself: Mo Fei is terrible for real, I have never met someone more terrible than him!Su Rong glanced at Lou Yu. He was quite surprised that Lou Yu would speak for Mo Fei.Lin Feiyu said with his brows knitted, \u201cBrother Lou Yu, you seldom speak for someone.\u201dLou Yu smiled, \u201cMo Fei will be my consort. Of course I should speak for him.\u201dLin Feiyu\u2019s face got a little stiff, \u201cIt seems you really like that guy called Mo Fei. I wish you all the best.\u201dLou Yu smiled, \u201cThank you.\u201dAt this time a star car drove by, from which walked out a handsome young man wearing a silver suit.\u201cFeiyu, what are you doing here? I was looking for you. Mother invites us for dinner tonight.\u201d said Lou Feng.Lin Feiyu then smiled at Lou Yu regrettably, \u201cBrother Lou Yu, I gotta go.\u201dLou Yu nodded as a response. Then Lin Feiyu ran at Lou Feng. Lou Feng held Lin Feiyu\u2019s shoulder and gave Lou Yu a provoking look in an angle Lin Feiyu couldn\u2019t see.Lou Yu narrowed his eyes, with raging fire in his eyes.With Lin Feiyu in his arms, Lou Feng felt kind of cocky, thinking, \u201cLou Yu had higher aptitude than me. So what? At last the one he loves loves me! Even though so many people out there like Lou Yu, but finally he ends up marrying a two-bit nobody.\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I feed you for free. And you detest me?!\u201d\u201cYoung master, please go take a bath. The wedding car is arriving. I heard Prince Yu has the propensity for violence. If he smells you like this, he may disable you, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d said Mo Yi with a hand pinching his nose.After some calculating, Mo Fei knew he aint\u2019s Lou Yu\u2019s match in every aspect. So he nodded, \u201cAll right. I\u2019m gonna wash myself.\u201dOn the way to the bathroom, Mo Fei remembered something. So he turned around and said to Mo Yi, \u201cThat thing I told you. Don\u2019t forget about it!\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201dAfter Mo Fei took a bath and got all dressed up, the wedding car had just arrived.\u201cPrince Yu is here. Prince Yu is here.\u201dThe loud noise outside nearly deafened Mo Yi.Mo Fei was brought out under the Mo Yi\u2019s support, wearing an exquisite formal suit. One could tell Lou Yu got kind of stunned on seeing Mo Fei.Lou Yu also noticed that. So he felt a little cocky in his heart.While looking at Mo Fei, Su Rong thought to himself, \u201cActually this guy is kind of cute.\u201dLou Yu pulled Mo Fei to himself and whispered by his ear, \u201cClothes make a man just as a saddle makes a horse. Dressing up like this, you do look kind of fucking hot.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cPrince Yu, I love you!\u201d\u201cPrince Yu, I love you!\u201d\u2026On both sides of the road were crowded with all beautiful and young girls who were expressing their love for Lou Yu at the top of their lungs holding flowers in their hands.Mo Fei knitted his eyebrows, thinking, \u201cThis is my big day today. Is it really appropriate for those girls to show affections to my husband in my face?\u201dLou Yu smiled and waved at them, looking so charming.Lou Yu pulled Mo Fei\u2019s hand and squeezed him into his star car.\u201cYoung master, young master, wait for me!\u201d Mo Yi also hopped in the star car taking advantage of the chaos.The star car slowly flew into the sky and drove towards the imperial caopital.Within the star car there were quite a few spacious rooms. Once Lou Yu entered the car, he immediately dusted off Mo Fei\u2019s hand.While loosening his wrist, Mo Fei thought to himself, \u201cStingy, sharp-tongued, petty, double-dealing, and violent\u2026Such a good-for-nothing is popular? What is wrong with this goddamn world?\u201dLou Yu said coldly, \u201cThere\u2019s a party tonight. Many big shots of the empire will be present. Don\u2019t embarrass me.\u201dMo Fei nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201dLou Yu cast a glance at Mo Fei and then walked into a room, totally ignoring Mo Fei.Su Rong then walked to Mo Fei, \u201cYour Highness, there\u2019re a few hours before we arrive at the imperial capital. So you can get into a room to take some rest.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cYes, right. I also think I need some rest.\u201dOnce Su Rong left, Mo Fei and Mo Yi immediately picked a room and went in.Mo Fei looked at Mo Yi while rubbing his hands, \u201cDid you get it?\u201dMo Yi nodded and then took out his Space Ring. Mo Yi then incanted in his heart and then a heap of glittering gold, silver and jewelries were piled on the bed.Mo Yi said, \u201cI have searched both the Madam and Miss\u2019 rooms and all their jewelries are here. There are also a lot of good stuff at the master\u2019s place. But they are locked, so I only took a ring.Mo Fei nodded, \u201cThis ring alone is good enough. A Space Ring! It\u2019s worthless!\u201dMo Yi nodded.Mo Fei narrowed his eyes and stared at those jewelries greedily, \u201cHum! She embezzles my monthly payment while getting herself and her daughter both dressed up everyday. Now she finally got her karma!\u201dAt Mo FamilyWhen Mo Yu opened her jewel case, she screamed like crazy.Lin Xi was also looking at her messy bedroom grumpily.And when Mo Yang found his ring was missing, he could only light a cigar.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mo Fei and Mo Yi immediately put away all the stuff.On seeing it was Su Rong, Mo Fei put on a big smile on his face and tried to fawn on, \u201cRong, what can I do for you?\u201d|\u201cMr. Mo Fei, we are arriving at the imperial capital.\u201d said Su Rong.Mo Fei nodded, \u201cI know.\u201dSu Rong turned around and glanced at Mo Fei, hemmed and hawed.Noticing Su Rong\u2019s embarrassment, Mo Fei asked out of curiosity. \u201cMr. Su, do you have something to say?\u201d\u201cMy lord, please do not laugh so exaggeratedly. Please stay reserved.\u201d said Su Rong.Watching Su Rong leave, Mo Fei said to Mo Yi, \u201cSee? See? Like master, like servant.\u201dMo Yi nodded approvingly.The star car was gradually slowing down. Lou Yu already came out of the lounge of the star car, looking quite serious.Mo Fei looked at Lou Yu on standby, thinking, \u201cSeen from his face, it\u2019s not like he is getting married, but like going to a war!\u201dMo Fei then walked to Lou Yu\u2019s side. Lou Yu gave a glance at him blandly, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dOut and away, Mo Fei could see the resplendent and magnificent imperial palace, feeling an upsurge of emotion.Lou Yu held Mo Fei\u2019s hand and walked into the palace. Inside the palace, numerous beautiful ladies and celebrities were chatting and drinking. When seeing Lou and Mo Fei walk in, they immediately lowered their voice.Suddenly with so many pairs of eyes focused on him, Mo Fei felt a little nervous.Holding Mo Fei\u2019s hand, Lou Yu leaned to Mo Fei\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cAre you afraid? Why are your legs turning into jello?\u201dMo Fei then whispered in Lou Yu\u2019s ear, \u201cWith so many beautiful women staring at me, my whole body is turning into jello, let alone my legs,\u201dLou Yu forced a smile, \u201cThat\u2019s not my concern. But if you make me humiliated, I promise you\u2019ll be sorry.\u201dMo Fei looked at the gentle and soft smile on Lou Yu\u2019s face, thinking, \u201cThe phrase A Beast in Human Face is specially invented for assholes like Lou Yu.\u201dAt this time, a well-dressed and noble-looking woman walked forward, with a handsome and modest man following. Though that man looked friendly, Mo Fei dared not neglect him. That was the king of Rong Country!\u201cSo this is Mo Fei? Really handsome like they said!\u201d Na Lanyue said.Mo Fei put on a fake smile, \u201cQueen mother, you overpraise me.\u201dNa Lanyue then turned to Lou Yu, \u201cMy son Lou Yu is a little wilful. I never expected that you would be so intimate already. It seems you\u2019re made for each other!\u201dMo Fei forced a smile and didn\u2019t say a word. Made for each other? Or made to hurt each other?Lou Yu looked at Na Lanyue blandly, while Na Lanyue always wore that gentle smile on her face, totally ignoring Lou Yu\u2019s silent protest.\u201cPlease suit yourself, Queen mother. I\u2019m gonna entertain the guests.\u201d said Lou Yu while dragging Mo Fei away.Mo Fei had no choice but to go with him.When they were out of people\u2019s sight, Lou Yu immediately ditched Mo Fei\u2019s hand, \u201cSuit yourself.\u201dMo Fei relaxed his wrist while heaving a sigh sullenly.Lou Yu then left Mo Fei alone and went to entertain the guests.After Lou Yu left, Mo Fei\u2019s eyes immediately got attracted by the delicious food.All kinds of pastries, a wide variety, which made Mo Fei\u2019s eyes shining!Mo Fei couldn\u2019t help rubbing his hands. During such a long time since his transmigration, he had been strapped for cash. Fancy food like pastries only existed in his dream!Mo Fei took a full plate of pastries and chowed down in a corner.\u201cPrince Yu, your bride seems really starving!\u201d a noble lady sneered with a fan covering her mouth.Lou Yu smiled awkwardly, \u201cI guess so.\u201dThough Lou Yu looked calm and quiet on the surface, he had already squeezed Mo Fei\u2019s neck with his hands in his heart.Princess Lou Jing looked at Mo Fei, with scornful smile on her face, \u201cAn absolute bumpkin! Really ill-bred.\u201dLou Feng looked at Mo Fei, saying with a sarcastic tone, \u201cHe has been rejected like over ten times.

Even a pig wouldn\u2019t eat so much.\u201d ridiculed Lou Jing.Mo Fei blinked and said, \u201cHow could I? There is so much food here. Do you also want some? Help yourself!\u201dMo Fei sized Lou Jing up and then lowered his voice, \u201cGirl, you better not eat too much. A girl should keep fit, or no one will marry you.\u201dLou Jing stared at Mo Fei gloomily, \u201cAre you implying I am fat?\u201dMo Fei smiled, \u201cOh come on! Actually\u2026you\u2019re\u2026just a little\u2026a little bit fat.\u201dLou Jing looked super awkward, with raging fire under her eyes, \u201cThis is the first time someone said I am fat!\u201dMo Fei then sized her up and said, \u201cGirl, maybe because of your bad temper, so no one dare to say it in your face. If you want to hear the truth, you should learn to be more approachable. You know, not everyone is as sincere as I am. Girl, even your younger brother has been married while you are still single. Don\u2019t you think you should reflect on yourself?\u201dSu Rong looked at Mo Fei, with his jaws dropped onto the floor.Lou Jing\u2019s face turned deathly pale. She snorted and then walked away.Then Mo Fei kept gulping the cake, thinking, \u201cNo wonder they are brother and sister. Even the way they snorted is the same, so slutty!Su Rong looked at Mo Fei, saying, \u201cYou have offended Princess Jing.\u201dAfter finishing that piece of cake, Mo Fei said sullenly, \u201cI\u2019m just telling the truth. Oh, I forgot. Nowadays anyone who likes telling the truth is always not welcomed. But as honest as I am, I\u2019d feel guilty if I don\u2019t tell the truth.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYoung master, are you OK?\u201d Mo Yi came to them and asked.Mo Fei shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m fine. What are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI told Mr. Su I was gonna help and here I am.\u201d Mo Yi said.Mo Fei nodded and then looked at Mo Yi with a pair of shining eyes, \u201cSo many hot chicks here! This is a rare chance.\u201dMo Yi rubbed his forehead, \u201cYoung master, beautiful women are not into foodies.\u201dMo Fei looked quite embarrassed, \u201cI want both cakes and hot chicks. But if I have to pick one, then cakes!\u201d Beautiful women are not eatable anyway!Mo Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dLou Feng then pulled Lin Feiyu to Lou Yu\u2019s side, \u201cYu, your wife has never stopped eating since he came in.\u201dLou Yu said flatly, \u201cThen leave him. It\u2019s a blessing to be a foodie.\u201dLou Feng laughed, \u201cYu, you are really good to your wife!\u201dLou Yu just ignored his words and said with a smile, \u201cHe is my wife anyway. Of course I should be good to him.\u201dLou Feng cast a glance at Lin Feiyu, \u201cWell, Feiyu has prepared a song for your big day.\u201dLou Yu cast an eye at Lin Fei with a complicated expression, \u201cThanks.\u201dWhile Mo Fei was chowing down those cakes, Mo Fei was already thoughtful enough to cut the new cake into pieces and put them in his plate.Su Rong watched those two, speechless.While Mo Fei was digging, the whole place suddenly went silent, then the piano was heard in the hall.Mo Fei pressed his chest and asked with a low voice, \u201cWho is it? Why is he sawing wood while I am eating cakes? It nearly got me choked.\u201dSu Rong looked at Mo Fei, wearing a complicated expression, thinking, \u201cDoes Mo Fei say that on purpose since he already knew Lin Feiyu is the man on Prince Yu\u2019s mind?\u201dMo Yi stood on his tiptoe. After a while, he said to Mo Fei, \u201cYoung master, it looks like a toy boy is playing piano.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Fei then rubbed his nose, \u201cI got it.\u201dSu Rong turned to Mo Fei and tried to explain, \u201cIt is Mr. Lin Feiyu who is playing the piano. He has both superb spiritual and physical aptitudes. And he also has great performances not only in developing potions, but also in a lot of areas like music, drawing and literature. He is the champion of the last Doron Piano Competition.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cDoron Piano Competition? How many people have participated?\u201dSu Rong said reluctantly, \u201cA lot.\u201dMo Fei kept digging the cakes drowsily, thinking, \u201cPeople here are so corrupt. With that lame level, he could even win the championship?\u201dSeeing Mo Fei\u2019s disapproving expression, Su Rong thought to himself, \u201cMo Fei the idiot, he has no taste at all.\u201dAfter it was finished, all people on site gave him their heated applause from deep of their hearts.With a plate on the left hand, and a fork on the right hand, Mo Fei didn\u2019t applaud.Lin Feiyu then stood up in people\u2019s applause, and bowed politely to the audience.Then Lou Jing\u2019s voice was heard, \u201cYu, your new sister-in-law doesn\u2019t appreciate your performance.

Since my performance is like sawing the wood in your eyes, I bet you would do it way much better.\u201d said Lin Feiyu gently, with kind of overwhelming tone.Mo Fei smiled and then said, \u201cYou must be joking.\u201dLou Jing then raised her voice, \u201cSister-in-law, you play a song for us today.

He then said to Lin Feiyu, \u201cAll right then.\u201dSu Rong was close to them. On hearing Mo Yi\u2019e words, his mouth twitched involuntarily.Su Rong had a feeling that Mu Fei\u2019s temperament had completely changed when he stood before the piano. It was kind of noble and graceful. Su Rong then wore a fake smile, thinking, \u201cI must be possessed. How could Mo Fei be connected with words like noble or elegant or graceful?\u201dAn insider could tell whether it was good or not the moment he began to play. The music standard on Grandsky Star was way much higher than on Skylight Star. Lin Feiyu had learned piano only to make himself look better, so he wasn\u2019t so concentrated, while Mo Fei had learnt piano to woo girls. So one could immediately tell who would be more devoted.The melodious music was resounding in the hall. The beautiful music was full of touching magic. Most girls\u2019 eyes now were all focused on Mo Fei, which greatly motivated Mo Fei\u2019s passion.Lou Jing gritted her teeth restlessly. Once the piano sound was heard, she knew that her plan was spoiled. How could this goddamn bumpkin play piano so well?! This was unreasonable!Su Rong looked at Mo Fei surprisingly, feeling shocked in his heart.\u201cWhen has your young master learnt piano? Why didn\u2019t I know?\u201d asked Su Rong while turning to Mo Yi.Mo Yi held his chest out and glanced at Su Rong blandly, saying with a cocky tone, \u201cOur young master is almighty!\u201dSu Rong twitched his mouth, totally ignoring Mo Yi then.Seeing Su Rong\u2019s deprecating expression, Mo Yi said with distain, \u201cA guy with two empty holes in your eyes, someday you\u2019d know how good our young master could be.\u201dLin Feiyu now looked super awkward. Although the pleasant piano was resounding in the hall, Lin Feiyu was not in the mood to appreciate it at all.\u201cPrince Yu, never expected the crown princess could play piano so well!\u201d People all sucked up to Prince Yu.Lou Yu forced a smile, \u201cYou overpraise him. Just so so.\u201d Lou Yu narrowed his eyes while shaking the glass in his hand, wearing kind of complicated expression.And now Imperial Consort Na Lan was also sizing up Mo Fei.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I got carsickness. I\u2019m gonna puke.\u201d Mo Fei said to Lou Yu who was driving the star car.Lou Yu peeped at Mo Fei blandly, \u201cThe only reason you wanna puke is you have had too much.\u201dMo Fei licked his lips, \u201cThey are too delicious. The imperial pastry cooks are awesome. Much better than any others.\u201dLou Yu\u2019s face darkened, he then asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know you can play piano?\u201dMo Fei put on a meaningful smile, and said with his pinky up, \u201cAre you even my husband? I have married you, while you know nothing about me!\u201d\u201cYoung master, Prince Yu has to run a country. How could he have time to get to know about you? The one who knows you the best is me!\u201d sucked up Mo Yi.Su Rong, \u201c\u2026\u2019Mo Yi, \u201cYoung master, you feeling better now? How about I rub your belly for you?\u201dMo Fei, \u201cMo Yi, you are so nice. If you hadn\u2019t had already received the S potion, I would have already married you.\u201dMo Yi, \u201cYoung master, if I hadn\u2019t had taken the S potion, I would have already given my heart to you.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201d Is it really a good thing to flirt before Prince Yu?\u201cMo Fei, you\u2019d better behave yourself.\u201d said Lou Yu coldly.Mo Fei shrugged his shoulder, \u201cI heard the toy boy at the banquet was your ex. Do you feel hurt that I humiliated him?\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cFeiyu is not a toy boy. Watch your language.\u201d Lou Yu suddenly stepped hard on the gas.Mo Fei shivered, \u201cYes, yes, I know. I was just saying he has fair skin and looks cute, nothing else. Drive slowly! I am still young. You wanna die since you got dumped. But I am still young and I don\u2019t wanna die for love with you.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dLou Yu tried to calm himself down, \u201cThe new term of Imperial College is beginning. I have had your school roll transferred.\u201dMo Fei rubbed his nose. When he had transmigrated into this world, the original Mo Fei had just killed himself after having the suspension of schooling. Now it had been a whole year.Mo Fei then blinked his eyes, \u201cDo I have to study in there?\u201dSu Rong nodded, and explained to him, \u201cMr. Mo, you are the Crown Princess now. You have to learn in the elite class of the Imperial College.\u201d\u201cElite Class?\u201d asked Mo Fei out of curiosity.Su Rong then nodded, \u201cYes. Those who join the elite class are all wives of the heirs of noble families.\u201dSo Su Rong meant the elite class was specially to educate the wives of those heirs of the big families. Wives of those big shots? So\u2026Mo Fei popped his eyes out and asked with excitement, \u201cSo there\u2019re a lot of beautiful women in the class?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201d answered Su Rong.\u201cAlas! Throwing me into this class is like throwing a wolf into a block of sheep.\u201d said Mo Fei excitedly.Mo Yi looked at Mo Fei pitifully, \u201cYoung master, you are mistaken. This is like throwing a sheep into a pack of wolves. They are hard to play with. You\u2019d better be careful.\u201dMo Fei then nodded, \u201cIt makes sense. Nowadays a good-natured beautiful woman is harder to get than a nine level star magician.\u201dMo Yi frowned, \u201cYoung master, those beautiful women are all engaged, ever harder to play with.\u201dMo Fei then forced a smile, \u201cI\u2019m just saying.\u201dSu Rong looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cUnlike other classes, it\u2019s all beautiful women in the elite class. Those beauties all have solid background. Don\u2019t lay a finger on any of them.\u201dMo Fei blinked, \u201cI got it.\u201dSu Rong looked at Mo Fei, \u201cDo you still remember your grades of the finals in that college?\u201dMo Fei shook his head, \u201cNo.\u201dLou Yu then cut in, \u201cBody arts, 34 points. Spiritual power application: 44 points. Interstellar History: 47 points. Pharmaceutics: 54 points. Interstellar math: 64 points. Interstellar literature: 74 points\u2026The highest score is only 74. Why don\u2019t you kill yourself?\u201dMo Fei rubbed his nose, \u201cEven an ant knows to struggle for life. How could Ikill myself for such a trivial matter? Prince Yu, you really don\u2019t cherish lives.\u201dLou Yu said blandly, \u201cIf I have a son who has such low marks, I\u2019m gonna strangle him!\u201dMo Fei snorted, \u201cDon\u2019t expect me to give birth to a boy for you.\u201d\u201cNever expected that.\u201d said Lou Yu coldly.Su Rong looked at the two of them, confused.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So you need to make some preparations.\u201dMo Fei felt quite confused, \u201cWhat? A test when the term begins?! This is brutal and inhuman!\u201dSu Rong then smiled, \u201cThis is the tradition of the Imperial College. Lord Mo Fei, you better figure out how to pass the examination later.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dLou Yu cast a glance at Mo Fei and said, \u201cIf you still have that low marks to humiliate me, I\u2019m gonna strangle you.\u201dMo Fei looked at Lou Yu plaintively, \u201cMy Highness, strangling people is against the law. Besides, three of your fianc\u00e9es have died. If I die, people will know someone like me who has incompatible jimbook with you and has strong vitality still can\u2019t suppress you, I\u2019m afraid no one is gonna marry you and you\u2019ll stay single for your whole life.\u201dLou Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dSuddenly a sharp sound was heard. Their star car was nosing down! Mo Fei screamed while pressing his ears!Then the star car was pulled over steadily on the ground. Lou Yu caught a glimpse of Mo Fei coldly, \u201cWe are home.\u201dMo Fei exhaled a long breath and then crawled out of the star car with Mo Yi, \u201cHis driving skill sucks! How did he get his driving license? It\u2019s nothing he dies. If a talent like me dies in a car accident, that\u2019d be a great loss.\u201dMo Fei then walked into Prince Yu\u2019s manor with Mo Yi.Watching Mo Fei and Mo Yi\u2019s backs, Lou Yu asked Su Rong, \u201cSu Rong, what do you say?\u201dSu Rong hesitated for a bit, \u201cThe Crown Princess is unfathomable.\u201dLou Yu looked at Su Rong surprisingly, \u201cWhy?\u201dSu Rong smiled slightly and said with a suspicious tone, \u201cI found he is a level 1 star magician.\u201dLevel 1 star magicians might be strong in remote areas of the imperial capital. But in the imperial capital, they were just as tiny as dust. But as the unfavored one at home, Mo Fei had no resources and owned bad aptitude, it seemed a little weird that he could become a level 1 star magician.Lou Yu sneered, \u201cMo Fei is not a problem, but Mo Yi is.\u201d It was not a difficult thing to become a level 1 star magician even with ill aptitude, as long as he would like to pay.\u201cMo Yi?\u201d asked Su Rong, confused.Lou Yu nodded, \u201cMo Yi is a level 3 star magician.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Su Rong couldn\u2019t believe his ears, with his eyes wide open.Level 3 star magician might be nothing in the imperial capital, but Mo Yi looked only 17 or 18 years old. He could even be as good as a talent in noble families in the imperial capital to have achieved to this level.In Mo Fei\u2019s place of his previous life, a level 3 star magician could already be rendered as a master. But what was his purpose to hide himself by Mo Fei\u2019s side?\u201cMy prince, you might make a mistake.\u201d Su Rong frowned.Lou Yu cast a glance at Su Rong and said earnestly, \u201cSu Rong, you need to practice \u00a0harder, otherwise even Mo Fei\u2019s servant is going to catch up with you.\u201dSu Rong\u2019s face immediately turned red. He was actually only a level 3 star magician. If he got caught up by a servant of the crown princess, that would be\u2026humiliating.\u201cMy prince, is it possible Mo Yi is not on Lord Crown Princess\u2019 side?\u201d asked Su Rong.\u201cI don\u2019t know. Just a level 3 star magician. So what? He wouldn\u2019t make any fuss.\u201d said Lou Yu flatly.Lou Yu and Su Rong then walked into the hall, where Mo Fei was waiting, gazing around.On seeing Lou Yu, Mo Fei said, \u201cWhy are you so slow? Where are we gonna sleep?\u201dSu Rong immediately said, \u201cLord Mo, of course you should sleep with the prince. As for Mo Yi, I\u2019m gonna arrange another room for him.\u201dMo Fei popped his eyes out, \u201cWhat? Me sleeping with him?\u201dSu Rong shrugged his shoulder, \u201cLord Mo, you have just got married. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit inappropriate to sleep apart now?\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Fei turned to Lou Yu, looking kind of embarrassed and painful.\u201cWhat? Do you feel wronged to sleep with me?\u201d asked Lou Yu, sneering.Mo Fei immediately wore a flattering smile, \u201cWhat? I mean, of course not. I\u2019m just worried you may feel wronged. I\u2019ll feel guilty if such a big shot like you feel wronged because of me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m good.\u201d Lou Yu smiled jauntily.Watching Lou Yu\u2019s smile, Mo Fei had a feeling that something ain\u2019t no right.After Mo Fei went into their room with Lou Yu, Lou Yu just threw him a quilt and a pillow, \u201cHere.\u201dMo Fei\u2019s face darkened, \u201cWhy are you giving me these?\u201d\u201cYou sleep on the floor!\u201d said Lou Yu.Mo Fei pulled a long face, \u201cIf you want me to sleep on the floor, you should at least give me two quilts, one as a cushion, one to tuck me in.\u201dLou Yu smiled, \u201cOnly one for you. No more. You can fold it.

Mo Yi looked at him and asked, \u201cYoung master, didn\u2019t you sleep well last night?\u201dMo Yi said with a sobbing tone, \u201cI\u2019ve got attached to my own bed.\u201dMo Yi looked at Mo Fei pitifully, \u201cYoung master, young master, given some time, you\u2019d get used to it.\u201dUnless Mo Fei, Lou Yu came out totally refreshed. Seeing the depressed Mo Fei, Lou Yu snorted and walked away.Watching Lou Yu leave, Mo Yi turned to Mo Fei and asked him with great interest, \u201cYoung master, is Prince Yu\u2019s body in shape?\u201dMo Fei, \u201cIt sucks! Bucket waist! Elephant legs! The point is his chest is flat! I don\u2019t wanna talk about it. His body is without a single redeeming feature!\u201dMo Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dSu Rong coughed lightly, \u201cMr. Mo, time to eat.\u201dMo Fei immediately got cheered up, \u201cIt\u2019s great! Eating is my favorite!\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dWatching Mo Fei gobbling, Mo Yi said, \u201cYoung master, the new term of the Imperial College opens in five days. I have downloaded some practice examination papers for you. You can try to do it later. Although it\u2019s a little late to bone up for the test, better late than never.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cOK. I will do it later.\u201dWatching those hundreds of sets of examination papers on Star website, Mo Fei felt like his head was gonna blow up.\u201cSo many?\u201d asked Mo Fei bitterly.Seeing her bitter expression, Mo Yi said, \u201cThere\u2019re thousands of them. I just picked some authoritative ones for you.\u201d\u201cThey say learning is like a boundless sea. I guess I\u2019m gonna drown in it!\u201d said Mo Fei desperately.Mo Fei picked one set and did it. After submitting it, Mo Fei and Mo Yi both stared at the screen without blinking.\u201cInterstellar history: 37, pharmaceutics: 64, interstellar math: 44, interstellar literature: 24\u2026 Young master, you have greatly retrogressed!\u201dMo Fei\u2019s face darkened, \u201cNo way!\u201d Mo Fei stared at the screen suspiciously, \u201cThe scoring system should\u2019ve made a mistake.\u201dMo Yi looked at Mo Fei reluctantly, \u201cYoung master, this scoring system is pretty authoritative.\u201dMo Fei, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it! You do one set.\u201dAfter Mo Yi\u2019s scores were out, Mo Fei dropped his jaws. All above 60! How had he never known the one closest to him was a smart ass?When Lou Yu entered the room, Mo Fei immediately got up and gave him a big smile, \u201cMy prince, you are back.\u201dLou Yu nodded, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m back.\u201d\u201cAre you hungry? I prepared some food for you.\u201d\u201cNot hungry.\u201d\u201cDo you feel sour in your shoulders? Let me give you a massage.\u201d\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d\u201cDo you feel hot? What about I fan the fan for you?\u201d\u201cNot necessary!\u201d\u2026\u201cWhy do you want nothing?\u201d said Mo Fei disappointedly.\u201cOne should want something from another when he is overzealous. So what is it? Shoot.\u201d said Lou Yu while looking at Mo Fei.Mo Fei said awkwardly, \u201cHere is the thing. I did a test this afternoon. And I found that my scores\u2026ain\u2019t no good.\u201dSu Rong laughed in his sleeve, thinking, \u201cNot good?

It was incredibly huge. It took Mo Fei over half an hour to find the examination room. He nearly missed the test.As an auditor, Mo Yi also took the test.There were eight courses in total. The first was body arts. Mo Fei got beaten up by the examiner during the test. He crawled up and got knocked down, on and on, with a bloody nose and a swollen face at last. In the following tests, it was all dark.\u201cYoung master, how did it go?\u201d Mo Yi walked to Mo Fei\u2019s side and asked.Wearing a turgid face, Mo Fei said, \u201cI got beaten up!\u201dMo Yi said sympathetically, \u201cYoung master, your body art examiner is really heartless.\u201dMo Fei\u2019s face darkened, \u201cYeah, he is.\u201dNot long after Mo Fei and Mo Yi returned to Prince Yu\u2019s manor, Lou Yu stormed at them.His voice was heard through the whole manor even before he showed up, \u201cMo Fei, get out!\u201dMo Yi looked at Mo Fei, asking, \u201cYoung master, judging from his tone, Prince Yu is kind of pissed off.\u201dMo Fei blinked, \u201cSo easy on the trigger.

You must be kidding, my prince.\u201d\u201cDo you have anything to say about your scores?\u201d asked Lou Yu.Mo Fei straightened his back, like being enlightened, \u201cFacts prove that it\u2019s no use making effort at the last moment.

We all have our own numbers. Those with high scores sit in the front. Ours are in the back. Let\u2019s go sit in the middle.

How did you write your essay? How could you only get 23 points?\u201dMo Fei smiled awkwardly, \u201cI just wrote what was on my mind.\u201dYan Chen held his chin with his hands, \u201cI only got 47 points and my Chenchen was already super pissed off. But when he found that you only got 23 points, less than half of my score, he immediately turned happy.\u201dMo Fei forced a smile. Young man, it\u2019s not right to rub salt onto other\u2019s wound.At this time a hot female teacher walked in. She scanned those students coldly and said flatly, \u201cIn this class, we\u2019re gonna appreciate an article written by Mo Fei.\u201dThen the sweet sweet sound of the teacher was resounding in the whole classroom, while Mo Fei wore a bitter face, thinking, \u201cdear teacher, don\u2019t you know to respect other\u2019s privacy?\u201d\u201cTitle: My husband!He has a pair of big eyes and bushy eyebrows. He looks quite real when he is bluffing.He has a small mouth with red lips. When he talks, it makes one want to die.When I call him Prince Yu gently and affectionately,he always answers with a hum blandly.My husband is called Lou Yu, the third prince of the empire. People all say that I am not good enough for him. But as for me, I don\u2019t think I am that bad. Of course, he is the prince anyway, so I will try my best to deserve him!If I can use an animal to describe him, I think he is a turkey.Every time I see him, he\u2019d spit fire at me somehow or other. I think he is extremely, specially and unbelievably irritable.And I heard that someone irritable won\u2019t live long.But don\u2019t you think that I am cursing him. How could I curse him? If he passes away, I am the one who is gonna live in widowhood.If I can describe him with a flower, I think he is a vileplume.You can only appreciate it from afar. But if you observe closely\u2026you\u2019d be so dead!Before I knew about him, I thought he should be a short-spoken person.But after I know about him, I find that he is as talktive as the granny downstairs at my home.But fortunately he is not so unapproachable as I imagined. And he is chatterbox.Pity that granny always praise me while he always scolds me.As for the virtues, um, he is loud, and his fists are very powerful. People say that he has a lot of virtues, sorry, I just haven\u2019t found any.About his defects, a lot of people told me he is a flawless man, but I think they are not telling the truth. No one is perfect, including him.\u201dIn my eyes, he has too many defects, petty, stingy, ill-tempered, ungraceful, shameless, as blind as a bat, and unreasonable\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThis article is total bullshit. The metaphors are neither fish nor fowl. Did you learn your interstellar literature from your math teacher? Mo Fei, is this really Prince Yu? You are bringing shame on Prince Yu.

Actually I think your article is not bad.\u201dMo Fei\u2019s eyes immediately shone, \u201cYoung man, you have a good taste. People who know how to appreciate good stuff like you are hard to fine.\u201dYan Chen smiled shyly, \u201cYou flatter me.\u201dMo Fei toughened his scalp to finish all the classes of the first day and then took a bus to Prince Yu\u2019s manor with Mo Yi.\u201cYoung master, your article is published on the campus network of the Imperial College.\u201d said Mo Yi.Mo Fei raised his eyebrows, \u201cReally? How are people\u2019s reactions?\u201dMo Yi, \u201c312 people gave it a like.\u201dMo Fei, \u201cThe mass\u2019 eyes are bright.\u201dMo Yi, \u201cBut 21,362 people gave it a dislike.\u201dMo Fei, \u201cThe truth is always in the hand of the minority.\u201dMo Yi, \u201cYoung master, we are home.\u201dMo Fei, \u201cthen let\u2019s get off.\u201d\u2026Mo Fei stood before the entrance of the manor, \u201cWhy do I feel a little cold down my spine.\u201dMo Yi blinked, \u201cMaybe the weather is getting cold.\u201dSu Rong then came out. When he saw them, he put on a very bright smile.\u201cLord Mo, you are back.\u201d said Su Rong.Mo Fei nodded, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m back.\u201dSu Rong then nodded, \u201cGet in. The prince has been waiting for you.\u201dMo Fei forced a smile, \u201cWhat? Why is he waiting for me?

Under his overwhelming momentum, Mo Fei was forced to back up a few steps.\u201cYou think I look like a turkey?\u201d asked Lou Yu.Mo Fei laughed awkwardly, \u201cActually I was swaying between turkey and Flaming Tiger. After weighing for quite some time, I think turkey is more amiable, and more approachable, and more appropriate to describe you. If you don\u2019t like it, I can change it now.\u201dLou Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou compared me with a nanny downstairs in your building?\u201d asked Lou Yu with his face twisted.Mo Fei forced a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t look down on her. The pastries she makes are super delicious. One may even swallow without chewing.\u201d\u201cYou think I am irritable?\u201d asked Lou Yu.Mo Fei shook his head, \u201cNo, I was just using hyperbole. You know, literature! You have to talk bullshit. If you write too true to life, you won\u2019t get a high score.\u201d\u201cSo your score is high now?\u201d ridiculed Lou Yu.Mo Fei smiled awkwardly, \u201cWell, I guess our teacher kind of doesn\u2019t appreciate my article.\u201dLou Yu narrowed his eyes and smiled, \u201cYou know what I want to do the most right now?\u201dMo Fei smiled, \u201cI think what you need to do now is calm down. As for things you wanna do, you can think slowly.\u201dLou Yu pulled Mo Fei\u2019s collar and dragged him away.\u201cWhat do you want? Let me be clear, I will never surrender.\u201d yelled Mo Fei.Lou Yu then sneered, \u201cForget about the interstellar literature. I think your body arts is too bad. Let me help you.\u201d\u201cThis is inappropriate. You are the prince. You teach me in person? You are wasting your talent.\u201d Mo Fei raised his voice.Lou Yu laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s good that you know it.\u201dAfter Mo Fei was dragged into the training room, the miserable howling was heard.Mo Yi narrowed his eyes, looking very worried.\u201cHelp! Help!\u201dMo Yi then walked to the training room, with his fists clenched.Su Rong then stood in the away, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cThe young master is shouting for help. I have to save him.\u201d said Mo Yi coldly.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your young master won\u2019t die. The prince is just teaching him a lesson.\u201d said Su Rong.Mo Yi ignored his words and said, \u201cWhat if Prince Yu hurt him accidentally?\u201dSu Rong said blandly, \u201cThat will never happen.\u201dMo Yi said disapprovingly, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dMo Yi then kept walking, but Su Rong stood in the away again.Mo Yi raised his eyes and looked at Su Rong indifferently, \u201cAre you trying to stop me?\u201dSu Rong was frightened by the cold light flashing in his eyes, \u201cSo what are you gonna do?\u201dMo Yi laughed grimly, which made Su Rong feel cold down his spine. The overwhelming murderous look made Su Rong raise his vigilance.Mo Yi then threw a punch at Su Rong.Mo Yi\u2019s fist was covered with a layer of blue light, which looked beautiful but actually with super power.Su Rong backed up vigilantly, with obvious scare. So he is really a level 3 star magician! He trusts Lou Yu, but in Su Rong\u2019s heart, he never doubted his judgment.Mo Yi\u2019s attack was very intense. After shocking, Su Rong immediately adjusted himself. He is an outstanding disciple of Su family. If he loses to the crown princess\u2019 servant, that\u2019d be humiliating.The screams in the training room became miserable, and Mo Yi\u2019s attack also became more intense.And now Su Rong\u2019s fighting will was activated. The two of them were having a heated fight, with all the vases in the hall broken.Su Rong wiped off the blood at the corner of his mouth, and looked at Mo Yi. It had been a long time since he met his match.Mo Yi looked at Su Rong with hostility.Suddenly the screams stopped in the training room and then Lou Yu came out.Mo Yi ignored Su Rong and quickened his steps to the training room.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So humiliating.\u201dSu Rong smiled awkwardly, \u201cHe is no better than me.\u201dLou Yu narrowed his eyes, thinking, \u201cIf Mo Yi is a nail that the Imperial Consort has planted beside him, he shouldn\u2019t expose his power so early. But if Mo Yi has nothing to do with the Imperial Consort, then how did Mo Fei the idiot make him his servant?\u201d\u201cIt hurts! It hurts!\u201d Mo Fei who got whacked got held up by Mo Yi.Wearing that bruised face, Mo Yi cast a glance at Lou Yu unfriendly.Lou Yu said flatly, \u201cHis injuries look terrible, but are just some bruises.\u201dMo Yi gave Lou Yu a filthy look and then supported Mo Fei to his room.Mo Fei lied on the bed, gritted his teeth and shouted, \u201cSomeday I\u2019m gonna nail him into the wall!\u201dMo Yi shrugged of his words and said, \u201cYoung master, Prince Yu is a level 5 star magician.\u201dMo Fei snorted, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? Someday I will catch up. From today, I\u2019m gonna learn hard. Someday I will become a level 5 magician and step him under my feet.\u201d\u201cYoung master, Prince Y owns double S aptitudes. When you become a level 5 star magician, maybe he has already been a level six or seven or eight star magician.\u201dMo Fei shook his head, \u201cNo way. He wouldn\u2019t break through to level six so soon!\u201dMo Yi asked out of curiosity, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cHis breaths, five short then one long. And his lips look a bit purple. And there\u2019s a little red light in his pupils. And his nails have kind of dark violet color. All those signs indicate that his meridian have been damaged before.\u201d said Mo Fei coldly.Mo Yi blinked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the consequence?\u201dMo Fei groveled on the bed, saying, \u201cThe star power he has absorbed, 90% would melt away through the damaged meridians, so his cultivating speed should be only 10% of his present cultivating speed. More than that, if this problem is not solved, he would only advance to a level 7 star magician at most. Of course, a level 7 star magician could already be rendered as a genius.\u201dMo Yi blinked, \u201cYoung master, he is already a level 5 star magician with damaged meridians, while you are in perfect state but only a level 1 star magician.\u201dMo Fei glanced at Mo Yi grumpily, \u201cCan you not throw cold water on me? Don\u2019t you now your young master I am a late bloomer? I will become strong soon enough.\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cWell, young master, you should grow faster.\u201dMO Yi then sprayed some healing medicinal liquid on Mo Fei, while Mo Fei blinked his eyes, saying, \u201cI\u2019m kind of well off recently. So I am thinking how to use the money to improve my power.\u201dMo Yi looked at Mo Fei, asking, \u201cIs Prince Yu curable?\u201dMo Yi said drowsily, \u201cYeah, but no. It needs the Nine Leaf Heaven-mending Herb. But no one knows whether it really exists.\u201dMO Yi nodded, \u201cI got it!\u201d\u201cDo you really care about him\u201d asked Mo Fei lazily.Mo Yi said blandly, \u201cNo, while those with common talents may thrive while Prince Yu may die. Now you are on the same boat with Prince Yu. If he dies, you won\u2019t be good.\u201dMo Fei touched his chin, \u201cYou are right. If he dies, people will think I am a hoodoo. And then those bitches would all blame me and kill me. I\u2019m already scared on thinking of it!\u201dAfter a pause, Mo Yi said, \u201cYoung master, you should figure out a way.\u201dMo Fei stuck out his tongue, \u201cWhat? What can I do?

I am not Prince Yu\u2019s rival. But you have to pin that Su Rong to save my face.\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cOK, I\u2019ll try. But actually that Su Rong is not as powerful as we thought. He just has connections and has more resources.\u201d\u201cTrust me. We are rich now. I will refine a magic weapon for you. Cultivating with it, your power will be skyrocketing. And at that time, be it Su Rong or Wang Rong or Zhang Rong, he wouldn\u2019t even take a move of you.\u201d said Mo Fei confidently.Mo Yi then smiled slightly, \u201cThank you, young master.\u201dLou Yu and Su Rong were not outside the door of Mo Yi\u2019s room, with their faces darkened.Lou Yu meant to check out Mo Fei\u2019s injuries but happened to overhear their conversation.Lou Yu and Su Rong looked at each other, stone-faced.When Lou Yu broke through to level 5, he got ambushed. Although he made it anyway, his meridians got hurt, which few people knew. But the Crown Prince\u2026he\u2026Lou Yu left without making any sound, while Su Rong followed him behind, saying, \u201cPrince, the Nine Leaf Heaven-mending Herbs Mr. Mo mentioned, do we need to send someone to look for it?\u201dLou Yu glanced at Su Rong blandly, \u201cYou buy his bullshit?\u201dSu Rong forced a smile, \u201cWe can have a try, I mean.\u201dLou Yu ignored his words, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a trap.\u201dSu Rong nodded, thinking, \u201cI must try to look for the \u00a0Nine Leaf Heaven-mending Herb.\u201dMo Fei touched his chin and asked, \u201cHow many star coins do we have now?\u201dMo Yi poured himself some wine and took a sip, \u00a0then said, \u201cWe sold the Skyriver Company and got 4 million star coins.\u201dIf sold together with those potion dispense tools, Skyriver was worth at least 8 million. But Mo Fei didn\u2019t want to sell them. So, he only sold the building.\u201cAnd those jewelries we stole from the madam and the miss, they sold it 1 million. So now we have 5 million in total.\u201dMo Fei nodded, then opened the Star website and started to buy the materials needed.There was a kind of cultivation formation on Grandsky Star to help with the cultivation. Mo Fei had always wanted to make one long time ago. Pity that he was poor before.Mo Fei kept selecting the suitable materials needed on Star website while his star coins were running away like water.After Mo Fei selected the last item, there were only 150 thousand star coins on his star card.Mo Fei stared at his star card, looking extremely bitter.Mo Yi comforted him, \u201cYoung master, don\u2019t be sad. We spend star coins, we earn them.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cYou are right.\u201dThe Interstellar Express was really fast. It was only three hours after Mo Fei placed all those orders, all his stuff was sent.Mo Fei took all of them and went to Mo Yi\u2019s room.Mo Fei used a few kinds of star herbs to compound the inscription potion he needed.Then Mo Fei used the inscription pen to inscribe the inscription on the formation.Due to a little mistake, the first formation was a failure. So the second time Mo Fei became extra careful. Finally he found the right feeling and successfully inscribed the second formation.Mo Fei inscribed six Energy Fusion Formation. After they were done, Mo Fei was dumbfounded. The Energy Fusion Formation could only be initiated by the star core. A level 3 star core could support it for at most three days. The star coins they were left now were far from enough.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mo Fei immediately went to welcome him, \u201cMr. Su, you are here.\u201dSu Rong felt at loose ends by Mo Fei\u2019s hospitality, \u201cMr. Mo, what do you want from me?\u201d\u201cYou are so smart. You got me.\u201d praised Mo Fei.Su Rong forced a smile, \u201cMr. Mo, what is it? Just shoot.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cWe found a new kind of magic weapon.\u201dMo Yi nodded and echoed, \u201cIt\u2019s called Cultivation Formation.\u201dSu Rong raised his eyebrows. That magic weapon Mo Fei mentioned really existed!Mo Yi then took out a half-palm big formation, saying, \u201cThis is the legendary Cultivation Formation. Your cultivation speed will double if you wear it on you.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d asked Su Rong.Mo Yi nodded, \u201cExactly, double! It means after you wear it, you only need five years to advance to level 4, which should cost you ten years.\u201dSu Rong looked at Mo Fei suspiciously, \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s real. Why would I lie to you? Doubled cultivation speed! What does it mean? If means if you are ordinary, but with it, one could say you are quite a genius. Mo Yi, let him have a try.\u201d said Mo Fei.Then Mo Yi handed the formation to Su Rong. And Su Rong suspiciously held it in his hand.To Su Rong surprise, the star power around gathered together at the double speed.And Su Rong\u2019s heart started to speed up out of his control.Mo Fei looked at Su Rong with his eyes shining, \u201cHow does it feel?\u201dSu Rong smiled, \u201cNot bad.\u201d\u201cSince you are an acquaintance, I can sell it at a preferential price.\u201d said Mo Fei.\u201cYou would sell it to me?\u201d asked Su Rong who already looked kind of excited now.Mo Fei nodded, \u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cHow much?\u201d Su Rong urged to ask.\u201c10 million star coins.\u201d Mo Fei held up a finger.\u201cDeal!\u201d Su Rong unhesitatingly transferred 10 million from his star card to Mo Fei, and held the formation in his hand tightly like he was afraid Mo Fei might regret it.Looking at Su Rong agreed so easily like 10 million was nothing to him, Mo Fei immediately regretted it! He was not bold enough to name a whopping price. What a shame!Su Rong asked curiously, \u201cMr. Mo, why would you recommend this to me instead of the prince?\u201d\u201cHow would that niggard spend so much\u2026\u201d Realizing it was inappropriate to say those words before Su Rong, Mo Fei immediately changed his tone, \u201cI mean, Prince Yu\u2026he\u2026he is not as generous as you!\u201dSu Rong thought to himself, \u201c\u2026Is it really appropriate to say Prince Yu a niggard?\u201d\u201cMr. Mo, can I used two at the same time?\u201d asked Su Rong. If so, one doubled. two quadrupled, and three sextupled.Mo Fei nodded, \u201cYeah, I think so. But the outcome would decrease. The second only has a half of the effect. So one is two times, two is three times, three 3.5 times, four 3.75 times\u2026And the upper limit is four times, even if you use 100, or 1000.\u201dSu Rong\u2019s eyes shone, \u201cThen I want another 9!\u201d\u201cNone!\u201d said Mo Fei decidedly.\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Su Rong.Mo Fei blurted it out, \u201cIf I give them all to you, when can we kick your ass?\u201dSeeing Su Rong\u2019s face turn stiff, Mo Fei forced a smile, \u201cI mean\u2026we have none.\u201dSu Rong looked at Mo Fei face, thinking, \u201cHow is that possible?\u201dSince they overheard about the magic weapon thing, Su Rong had always kept an eye on them. Su Rong was pretty sure Mo Fei made the formation himself. So if he wanted, he could make them endlessly.Su Rong then gave Mo Yi a glance. Now he and Mo Fei were on a par. But under Mo Fei\u2019s help, Mo Yi could quadruple his cultivation speed, while he could only double the speed. So in the future\u2026Mo Fei cast a glance at Su Rong blandly and became very serious, \u201cMy Rong, our deal is a secret, you know?\u201dSu Rong nodded, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201dMo Fei then nodded satisfactorily, \u201cIt\u2019s good. I know as smart as you are, you\u2019d know what to do and what not to do.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Fei then left happily with the star coins.As for the rest five formations, Mo Fei gave them all to Mo Yi generously, then bought some more ingredients on Star website and planned to make some more.On the other hand, after Mo Fei and Mo Yi left, Lou Yu came out from the back of Su Rong, imitating Mo Fei voice, \u201cMy Rong, I know as smart as you are, you\u2019d know what to do and what not to do.\u201dSu Rong felt a wisp of coldness jumping through his feet up to his head. Damn it! He was so thrilled that he even didn\u2019t notice Mo Fei called him \u2018my Rong\u2019.\u201cMy prince, you are back.\u201d Judging from Lou Yu\u2019s expression, Su Rong kind of had a feeling that he was jealous.Lou Yu nodded, \u201cI\u2019m back a while ago.\u201dSu Rong then handed over the formation to him cap in hand, \u201cMy prince, Lord Mo gave this to me.\u201dHolding the formation, Lou Yu narrowed his eyes, \u201cNot bad, huh?\u201dSu Rong nodded, \u201cYeah, I tried.

And then Mo Fei sullenly realized he said something wrong again.\u201cNo!\u201d Mo Fei forced a hollow laugh.Yan Chen nodded, wearing an \u201cI understand\u201d face, \u201cAs a new couple, it\u2019s natural you can\u2019t control yourselves. Don\u2019t be shy.\u201dMo Fei smiled with his head down, saying shyly, \u201cBut I have thin-skinned.\u201dMo Fei noticed that Lin Fei also cast his eyes at him suspiciously with his split vision.Yan Chen then said smilingly, \u201cMo Fei, don\u2019t you know? You go viral!|Mo Fei looked at Yan Chen, confused, \u201cWhat? How?\u201dYan Chen opened the Star website, \u201cIt\u2019s your article! Over 18,000 comments below. And 458 liked it, while 28,352 disliked it. You know, there are only over 30,000 students in our school. Your article has attracted much more attention than the article of the No. 1 authoress of our school now!\u201dMo Fei smiled, \u201cSure, how could a little girl compare with me?\u201dYan Chen nodded, and echoed, \u201cYeah, right!\u201d\u201cI liked your article. Chenchen said you tarnished Prince Yu\u2019s noble and elegant image. So he wanted to give you a dislike. But I logged in with his account number and liked it without letting him know.

How dare he compare his damn hilarious article to Ren Shanshan\u2019s?\u201d a harsh opposing sound was heard.Mo Fei frowned while looking at that person, \u201cWho is it?\u201dYan Chen\u2019s expression changed a bit, he then said, \u201cIt\u2019s Xu Zihan with a solid background. You better not offend him.\u201dMo Fei blinked, \u201cIs his family very powerful?\u201dYan Chen shook his head, \u201cHis family is nothing. But his fianc\u00e9 is really something. That is Zheng Xuan\u2014grandson of Zheng Hong, one of the three greatest generals of the empire.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cReally?\u201dYan Chen nodded, \u201cYeah. I heard Zheng Xuan obeys him in every way. He would do anything Xu Zihan asks him to do.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cThen he is like a puppet.\u201dMo Fei then rested his chin in his hand, thinking, \u201cHow I wish Prince Yu would also behave like a puppet like him.\u201dYan Chen secretly took out a fried dumpling out of his desk and slipped into his mouth. Seeing Yan Chen eating, Mo Fei couldn\u2019t help drooling, so Yan Chen gave him one down the desk.Yan Chen\u2019s mouth got stuffed full now, saying, \u201cBy the way, the topic of Fighting Department is My Lady. You know what Prince Yu wrote about?\u201dMo Fei shook his head, \u201cI didn\u2019t pay any attention!\u201dYan Chen looked at Mo Fei disapprovingly, \u201cHow could you not care about such important things? They said it\u2019s already on the internet. But I haven\u2019t seen it.\u201dMo Fei opened the Star website and found Prince Yu\u2019s article easily.My Lady:My lady, mentally retarded, idiot, shameless, mental disorder, useless, except these, I have no other comment.Mo Fei\u2019s face darkened, \u201cThat son of bitch!

And every objective is used just right. And the ending is like to dot the eyes of a painted dragon.\u201dMo Fei looked at the screen, confused, \u201cThis teacher is talking bullshit! Nowadays it\u2019s not easy to be a teacher who even has to learn to be a congenital liar.\u201dYan Chen nodded, \u201cYeah, a good teacher should be totipotential.\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The old man glanced at Mo Fei and Yan Chen coldly, \u201cWhispering head to head in class. Are you even students?\u201dThe old man then pointed at Mo Fei, \u201cYou! Stand up!\u201dMo Fei then got up awkwardly, while Yan Chen was looking at Mo Fei, secretly patting his chest.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d the old man bossed around.Mo Fei answered in an embarrassing tone, \u201cMo Fei.\u201d\u201cSo you are the crown princess!\u201d said the old man thoughtfully.Mo Fei nodded, \u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cYeah?! Don\u2019t be cocky since you are the crown princess! Let me ask you! How did the Hexagonal Building of Luohua City collapse?\u201d asked the old man defiantly.Mo Fei\u2019s face turned pale with fright, \u201cDid Prince Yu blow it? It\u2019s none of my business! I have no money. You should go to him, not me.\u201d He had just been in easy circumstances.The whole classroom went into silence. And after a moment, everyone guffawed.Mo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dThe old man glared at Mo Fei and said angrily, \u201cThe Hexagonal Building was blown up by the level 7 flying star beast Flame Eagle!

What\u2019s so funny?\u201d yelled the old man, \u201clet me tell you! History has taught us a lot of precious and valuable experience! If you don\u2019t learn history well, you may suffer losses someday!\u201d\u201cMo Fei, do you know what your mark is? 33! Only 33! Who is the third level 9 star magician in the history of Rong Country? What is your answer? Huh? Untraman! What the heck is Ultraman? If you get such score next time, I\u2019m gonna turn you into Astro Boy!\u201d said the old man unfriendly.Mo Fei forced a smile, looking very embarrassed.The old man glanced at Mo Fei disgustedly and then let him sit.Finally this class was over, Mo Fei bent over the table feebly.Yan Chen said with a bit excitement, \u201cMo Fei, what is Ultraman? Is he very powerful?\u201d\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d answered Mo Fei weakly.Yan Chen frowned, \u201cWhat a shame! I\u2019ve never heard of him. Fortunately you are here, otherwise that old man will fire at me. I only got 46 points.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter school, Mo Fei followed behind Mo Yi, depressed. Mo Yi looked at him and said, \u201cYoung master, don\u2019t put that old man\u2019s words on mind.\u201dMo Fei said pitifully, \u201cThis is really humiliating.\u201dMo Yi smiled, \u201cYoung master, you are too thin-skinned. Actually it\u2019s nothing. You wouldn\u2019t lose a pound of flesh.\u201dMo Fei\u2019s eyes immediately shone, \u201cYou are right. Quite right! That\u2019s what I wanted to say.\u201dOn the way back, a student recognized Mo Yi, first with his eyes wide open, then with his eyes filled with anger, and then he ran away.Mo Fei looked at that student and said, \u201cThat guy is sophomore, if I remember it right. He looks odd! Do you guys have a thing?\u201dMo Yi said flatly, \u201cThe day I got enrolled, he did the body arts test for me.\u201d\u201cOh, I got it.\u201d\u201cHe said he could not stop it when fighting. If I didn\u2019t want to be beaten up and lied in the school clinic, I should throw in the towel. And he would show mercy and sponsor me 1 point.\u201d\u201cAnd then?\u201d asked Mo Fei out of curiosity.Mo Yi smiled, \u201cThen I got him beaten up and dragged into the school clinic.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Yi shrugged his shoulder, \u201cThe one behind me during the entrance exam told me he is called Wang Meng, famous for his ferociousness. He thought he would never have the chance to get enrolled. But finally I beat up Wang Meng and got him sent to the clinic and the guy behind me finally got enrolled. To show his gratitude, he wants to treat me a big meal.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026did you go?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d said Mo Yi.\u201cWhy?\u201d said Mo Fei, perplexed.Mo Yi looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cBecause all your dates claimed to treat you to dinner, but finally it was you who paid.

Anything wrong?\u201dLou Yu looked Mo Fei up and down, then put on a bright smile, \u201cI heard you made the whole class drop their jaws.\u201dMo Fei said shyly, \u201cMy prince, you must be kidding. Just some random talk. How could I have that ability?\u201dLou Yu sneered, \u201cDon\u2019t be too modest. You are very capable. Just some random talk and it already made the whole class drop their jaws!\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dThen Lou Yu\u2019s expression suddenly changed, \u201cMo Fei, they told me you said I bombed the Hexagonal Building?\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cYeah, I thought it should be an enormous building! How could common people have that ability? Only a genius like you could bomb it!\u201d\u201cYou overpraise me.\u201d smiled Lou Yu.Mo Fei smiled awkwardly, \u201cNo, no, I heard that building got exploded by a bird. So trust me, my prince. As long as a bird could explode it, you surely can.\u201d\u201cYou let them claim for compensation from me?\u201d asked Lou Yu.Mo Fei then put on a fake smile, \u201cThey are poor. You should try to understand them.\u201dMo Yu glared at Mo Fei with that pair of raging eyes.After thinking for a bit, Mo Fei said, \u201cIf there is nothing else, I gotta go read some books.\u201dLou Yu nodded, \u201cOK, study hard. If you dare get such low scores again, I\u2019m gonna beat you to cerebral concussion.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026If I got cerebral concussion, I\u2019ll become dumb.\u201dLou Yu smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ve already dumb down to this level, how low could it be?\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Yi then pulled Mo Fei\u2019s sleeve, and lowered his voice, \u201cYoung master, cool down. Good men don\u2019t fight with women.\u201dMo Fei frowned, \u201cBut he is not a woman.\u201dMo Yi disapproved, \u201cBut you can take him as a woman.\u201dMo Fei\u2019s eyes shone, \u201cYou are right.\u201dLou Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Fei left Lou Yu alone there and went to his own room. After receiving the 10 million star coins from Su Rong, Mo Fei made another six Power Fusion Formations, and also two sets of pricey quilts.Mo Fei put those formations under his quilts. Thus, he could enhance his cultivation while lying on them.With continuous star power accumulating, Mo Fei excitedly absorbed the star force at the quadruple speed.Mo Yi went into the room, scanned the furnishings around. He felt something ain\u2019t no right, but couldn\u2019t tell where.After having cultivated on the bed for some time, Mo Yi frowned, then he took out one of the formations and noticed that the energy in star core nearly ran out.Mo Yi knitted his brows. So some asshole sneaked into his room and used his formation to cultivate.Su Rong watched Mo Yi enter into his room, with kind of jealousy in his eyes.Just now he went to Mo Yi\u2019s room with Lou Yu for cultivation. Nearly quadruple cultivation speed was really awesome!Su Rong frowned. Mo Yi could cultivate at such a rapid progress with the help of the magic weapon, while he had none\u2026Maybe next time he would get beaten up!Mo Yi didn\u2019t talk much, but actually he was a badass. Even the bully Wang Meng from grade two got his eight bones broken and begged for mercy.\u201cMy prince, since the formation is all good, would you please give it back to me?\u201d asked Su Rong tentatively.Lou Yu glanced at Su Rong and said, \u201cOh.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dSu Rong sighed in his heart, thinking, \u201cSo under the crown princess\u2019 pen, the prince is petty, stingy, ill-tempered, ungraceful, shameless, as blind as a bat, and unreasonable\u2026now it seems quite reasonable.\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You better behave yourself!\u201d Mo Fei looked at Lou Yu vigilantly.Lou Yu put on a friendly smile, \u201cToday I\u2019m in the mood. So you sleep on the bed while I sleep on the floor.\u201dMo Fei\u2019s face went stiff, \u201cThat\u2019s inappropriate! I will still sleep on the floor. You sleep on the bed. It\u2019s settled.\u201dLou Yu narrowed his eyes with his face darkened, \u201cI said you sleep on the bed. This is an order! Why are you so fussy?\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Fei wore a dark face and said grumpily, \u201cI\u2019ve got enuresis. I may wet your quilt.\u201dHis words stunned Lou Yu.Seeing Lou Yu was staring at him, Mo Fei immediately blushed! Pooh! Pooh! In order to sleep on the floor, he really cost too much.Lou Yu then sneered, \u201cYou sleep on the bed. But, if you dare wet my bed, I\u2019m gonna cut off your \u2018third leg\u2019.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d Son of a bicth! I have already threatened him at cost of badmouthing myself, but this guy didn\u2019t buy it at all! This is outrageous!Under Mo Fei\u2019s weirdly staring, Lou Yu lied down on Mo Fei\u2019s thick quilts.The moment Lou Yu lied on it, he felt a strong feeling of star power. He immediately became sleepless and started to cultivate.Mo Fei lied in bed, cursing Lou Yu for a while, and then started dreaming already.In the dream, Mo Fei is among the ocean of cakes, all sweet sweet cakes. When Mo Fei was about to pounce at the cakes and take a big bite, he got kicked awake.Mo Fei looked at Lou Yu and said fiercely, \u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201dLou Yu stroke his hair and said, \u201cWhy do those formations stop working?\u201dMo Fei took out a formation and examined, saying angrily, \u201cThe star core is used up, of course it stops working.\u201d\u201cYou use level 3 star core now. Will it hold a little longer if you use high level ones?\u201d asked Lou Yu.Mo Fei nodded, \u201cYeah, sure!\u201d\u201cThen why do you still use such low level star core?\u201d asked Lou Yu angrily.Mo Fei then also blew a fuse, \u201cWill you give me star coins to buy it?\u201dLou Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Fei gave Lou Yu a filthy look and then turned around and kept sleeping, while Lou Yu installed the star core in the formation and kept cultivating.When Mo Yi walked out of the room, he noticed Su Rong was staring right at him, or maybe staring at his room\u2026Then he realized he shouldn\u2019t put the formations in his room anymore, otherwise, maybe someday none of them would be left when he was out.Su Rong looked at Mo Yi, thinking, \u201cI have to figure out a way, otherwise, considering Mo Yi\u2019s four times cultivating speed, before long if we have a fight again, he would beaten me up and got me sent to the clinic like Wang Meng.Mo Yi is really malicious. He even sent Wang Meng such a big bully into the clinic, making him howling like a pig being butchered there.\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cI got something to talk to you.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cOK, shoot.\u201dLou Yu then passed a star card to Mo Fei. Mo Fei took it, and when he looked at it, he nearly dropped his jaws, \u201c5 billion?! You\u2026\u201d Are you insane?Lou Yu looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cI want that kind of formation, I want 1,000. This is your down payment.\u201dMo Fei nodded while holding the card in his hand, \u201cOK, but you can\u2019t tell anyone I made them. And you should provide all the materials which should also be kept confidential. You know, three of your wives died because of you. I don\u2019t want to be the fourth one.\u201dLou Yu nodded, \u201cRest assured. I know what to do and what not to do. Those formations have nothing to do with you.\u201dSince Lou Yu agreed, Mo Fei wrote down the things he needed excitedly. Since Lou Yu would pay all the bills, Mo Fei added extra star herbs he needed to make potions for his own use.Mo Fei felt so smug. Sometimes it was beneficial to marry a prince. If the man he married to was not powerful enough, to make such formations was sending himself to hell!Of course Lou Yu knew Mo Fei added something unneeded on the list, but he didn\u2019t say anything.Mo Fei had his morals. Whenever he had time, he would devote himself to making formations every day.Under the stimulation of star coins, Mo Fei was in high spirit and was making star formations the whole night, while Mo Yi acted as his assistant.The next day he went into the classroom wearing two dark circles under his eyes.Today Mo Fei noticed Yan Chen was a little antsy and also didn\u2019t talk like a bird like the other day.\u201cAre you OK?\u201d asked Mo Fei.Yan Chen frowned and said in low spirit, \u201cThere\u2019s potion class today.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cI know.\u201dYan Chen wore a sad face and said bitterly, \u201cNo one is doing worse than me in this class. I only got 39 points, tailender.\u201dYan Chen then cast a glance at Mo Fei plaintively.

Even the names of many same herbs were different. So actually Mo Fei\u2019s score was not pretty high.Yan Chen said enviously, \u201cSuch a high score!\u201dMo Fei then said sheepishly, \u201cI also think so.\u201d Of course it\u2019s high. This is the only course I\u2019ve passed.Xu Zihan then turned around and looked at the two, sneering, \u201cSeriously? You call that high? Are you kidding me? You are really bumpkins with no aspirations. Look at Lin Feiyu! He still stays low even if he got 98 points, while you are already proud of yourself since you only got 64 points?\u201dMo Fei narrowed his eyes and looked at this guy, \u201cWho are you? We weren\u2019t talking to you. Why are you barking there? Your voice sounds even worse than a crow, you know?\u201dXu Zihan\u2019s face darkened, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cI said your voice sounds even worse than a crow, what? Bite me!\u201d said Mo Fei with his eyes popped out.Yan Chen then pulled the sleeve of Mo Fei and said in a low voice, \u201cOK, enough. Don\u2019t quarrel with him. He\u2019ll beat you.\u201dMo Fei then glanced at Yan Chen and said, \u201cIt\u2019s OK. He is just a level 1 star magician. Nothing to be afraid.\u201d Just a level 1 star magician. If he was not his rival physically, he could use his mouth to bite him.Yan Chen frowned, \u201cHe is not the dreadful one, but his fianc\u00e9 is. Not long before two classmates offended him and his fianc\u00e9 beat them up and were sent to hospital. Finally they were even forced to transfer to other department.\u201dMo Fei then sized Xu Zihan up, \u201cSo it\u2019s a shrew! Does his fianc\u00e9 have myopic eyes?

I also think he should control himself.\u201dSome students in the first row stared at Mo Fei, with all contempt in their eyes.\u201cFeiyu, why would Prince Yu marry Mo Fei?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cI heard he got rejected 17 times. A total leftover.\u201d\u201cBad aptitude, bad grades, plus that ordinary-looking face, he is a total good-for-nothing!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Actually he\u2026he has his virtues.\u201d said Lin Feiyu hesitantly.\u201cVirtues? Where? Why don\u2019t I see it? Occupying such bad condition, how dare he loathe Prince Yu?\u201d\u201cPrince Yu must have been possessed, so he would have agreed on this marriage.\u201dXu Zihan looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cJust wait and see. Soon enough he will be dumped. I mean it!\u201d\u2026Yan Chen looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cThey are talking bullshit.

But you are better than him in all the other courses.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d What the hell? Since when he became the negative example?

Given that kind of family background, eating may already have been a problem.

I want you to have a clear understanding of yourselves.\u201d said Xu Zihan complacently.When Xu Zihan was saying that, he missed his step and fell on the stairway.Mo Fei smiled, \u201cZihan, I know you like gossiping. But you should watch your steps when you speak anyway. If you die from falling to the ground, don\u2019t expect me to shed tears for you. And, whether your fianc\u00e9 would shift his love to someone else, only god knows.\u201d\u201cMo Fei, it\u2019s you!\u201d shouted Xu Zihan.Yan Chen disapproved, \u201cXu Zihan, you\u2019re such a bully!

Stop make a scene.\u201d said the teacher blandly.Xu Zihan looked at the teacher and then said no more reluctantly.Mo Fei raised his eyebrows, thinking, \u201cDamn Mo Yi, how dare you trip him before the teacher? Fortunately the teacher has a bad sight and didn\u2019t see it.\u201dWhen Mo Fei walked into the lab, he got struck dumb.It was worthy of the lab of the Imperial College.

You have to refine them all. If none of the potions you make is qualified, you can go write your self-criticism after school. Now I\u2019m gonna demonstrate it for you. And then you can make it yourselves.\u201d said the teacher.Yan Chen kept his eyes wide open and observed every move of the teacher carefully. And soon the teacher was done, and a bottle of blue potion was placed on the desk.After the teacher was finished, Yan Chen scratched his head chagrined, while Mo Fei blinked his eyes, still chewing how the teacher had done it.Yan Chen elbowed Mo Fei, \u201cMo Fei, did you see it clearly?\u201dMo Fei was still immersed in it, \u201cYeah, sure. What a beautiful pair of hands! Ruddy, delicate, as soft as like boneless, slender and mellow, no word could exactly describe them properly.\u201d\u201cThank you for your praise, Mo Fei.\u201d a silver voice then was heard from behind.Mo Fei\u2019s face immediately went stiff. He immediately put on a smile, \u201cTeacher, your hands are too pretty. I\u2019m just saying what I feel.\u201dThe teacher grinned and then said spookily, \u201cSince you appreciate my hands so much, I have made a decision. If you can not make qualified potions, you\u2019ll write a 20,000-word self-criticism.\u201dMo Fei heaved a sigh. Women! You can neither praise them or scold them! So troublesome!Yan Chen then looked at Mo Fei pitifully, \u201cMo Fei, my condolences!\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I can hold it.\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I heard he is already a level 3 pharmacist. I\u2019m so jealous!\u201d\u201cHis master is the potion master Wen Rui. Of course he is way much better than all of us.\u201d\u2026Lin Feiyu then handed over a bottle of blue potion to the teacher. Then she put the potion under the detector, and it immediately showed a number.\u201c90% purity, not bad.\u201d praised the teacher while casting a glance at Lin Feiyu.\u201cYou overpraise me, teacher.\u201d Lin Feiyu put on a slight smile, in which there was also kind of arrogance.Lin Feiyu then turned to Mo Fei\u2019s direction, while Mo Fei was still putting his back into dispensing those herbs, totally ignoring him.Lin Feiyu frowned, with a bit of anger flashing in his eyes.Yan Chen blinked, \u201c90% purity. Impressive!\u201d\u201c90% purity. What does that mean?\u201d asked Mo Fei out of curiosity.Yan Chen then turned to Mo Fei, \u201cMo Fei, you don\u2019t know?\u201dMo Fei shook his head, \u201cNot really.\u201d\u201c60 percentage of purity is qualified, sixty percent to sixty-nine purity is low grade, seventy and seventy-nine percent purity is medium grade, eighty percent to eighty-nine percent purity is high grade, and ninety percent to ninety-nine percent of purity is top grade. So it means Lin Feiyu refined top level potion! Really impressive!\u201d Yan Chen\u2019s eyes are full of envy.Mo Fei noticed that the way of everyone was looking at Lin Feiyu was full of jealousy, while Lin Fei\u2019s face looked gentle and quite, but deep in his eyes one could still tell a slice of superiority feeling.Mo Fei frowned. In his eyes, Lin Feiyu\u2019s potion only met the qualified standard on Grandsky Star. But it could already be rendered as the top grade stuff? He then asked, \u201cYan Chen, does the low grade potion have serious side effect?\u201dYan Chen nodded, \u201cYeah, of course. Low grade potions might even be deadly, don\u2019t you know?\u201dMo Fei smiled awkwardly, \u201cNot really.\u201dYan Chen looked at him like he was an alien, \u201cHow did you pass the exam if you don\u2019t even know this?\u201dMo Fei said awkwardly, \u201cMaybe because of my good luck.\u201dYan Chen said, \u201cHm, you are really lucky.\u201d\u201cAre the side effects of low grade potions so serious? Will people buy it?\u201d asked Mo Fei.Yan Chen nodded, \u201cSure. Although they may have serious side effects, they are cheap!\u201dMo Fei frowned, thinking, \u201cWith such a high impurity content, who would dare to use it?\u201dYan Chen looked at Mo Fei and asked, \u201cMo Fei, what are you thinking?\u201dMo Fei smiled, \u201cI\u2019m thinking how to refine.\u201dYan Chen then said, \u201cI think I should start to think about how to write the 10,000-word self-criticism. Only 10,000 words! Isn\u2019t it great?\u201d Yan Chen then looked at Mo Fei and said with relief, \u201cMo Fei, you have to write 20,000 words. Lend it to me for reference when you are finished.\u201dMo Fei thought, \u201cYoung man, don\u2019t look down on Master Mo Fei!\u201dMo Fei then blurted out, \u201cMaybe I can refine the qualified potion. Who knows?\u201dYan Chen then blinked, looking a bit confused, \u201cMo Fei, you were concentrating on her hands. Do you really know how to refine the potions?\u201dMo Fei smiled, and said confidently, \u201cI am a lucky dog! Maybe I can refine it!\u201dMo Yan then looked at Mo Fei doubted.Mo Fei ignored him and started to extract the star herb liquid and refine the potion. Soon enough a bottle of potion was shown in Mo Fei\u2019s hand.Yan Chen looked at the bottle in Mo Fei\u2019s hand with his eyes wide open, \u201cIt\u2019s blue. It\u2019s color blue!\u201dMo Fei said, confused, \u201cShouldn\u2019t it be color blue?\u201dYan Chen said with disappointment, \u201cIt should be. But mine always has some weird colors.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Fei then moved forward and handed it over to the teacher, \u201cTeacher, I\u2019m done.\u201dThe teacher looked at the potion in his hand and said, \u201cIt looks good.\u201d\u201cYou overpraise me.\u201d said Mo Fei shyly.Then the teacher put in under the detector, and it showed a number \u201c91\u201d.Once 91 was read, the whole class fell in an uproar.Mo Fei frowned. He already refined it with reservation. How could it still be so high?Yan Chen opened his mouth wide, looking at Mo Fei incredulously.Lin Feiyu glared at Mo Fei, with anger and suspicion in his eyes.\u201cCheater! Teacher, he cheated!\u201d Xu Zihan protested.Mo Fei then looked at Xu Zihan angrily. This asshole always went against Master Mo Fei.

    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: Clearing the NameThe teacher then turned to Xu Zihan and asked with her eyebrows raised, \u201cCheating?\u201dXu Zihan nodded and said pretentiously, \u201cExactly. The one he made should have been failure. This bottle was already on him before he came. So he cheated!\u201dMo Fei\u2019s face darkened, \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking nonsense? Do you really think you have the ability to make 91% purity potion?\u201d said Xu Zihan while looking at Mo Fei contemptuously.Mo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d Damn it! Don\u2019t belittle others! 91% purity potion is just some rejects to Master Mo Fei! Rejects! OK?\u201cSave your loose tal!\u201d Yan Chen now came to his sense and retorted, \u201cI saw him make it with my eyes. He isn\u2019t cheating. He is just lucky!\u201d\u201cLucky? It\u2019s 91% purity potion! How lucky could he be?\u201d snorted Xu Zihan.Lin Fei then exhaled a long breath and said to Mo Fei earnestly, \u201cMo Fei, even if you don\u2019t want to write the 20,000-word self-criticism, you shouldn\u2019t cheat.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d What the hell!\u201cWhat? No words for yourself?\u201d Xu Zihan looked at Mo Fei, sneering, \u201cYou\u2019ve gone too far. Shouldn\u2019t you keep a low profile even if you cheat? How dare you make such superior level potion to expose yourself?\u201dMo Fei gritted his teeth, \u201cI didn\u2019t cheat. I refined it myself.\u201dXu Zihan looked at Mo Fei bitterly, \u201cYou\u2019re caught red-handed. Why do you still deny it?\u201dMo Fei, \u201cI\u2019m telling the truth. I didn\u2019t cheat!\u201d Damn it! You son of bitch!Lin Feiyu looked at Mo Fei pitifully, \u201cMo Fei, you are caught red-handed. Just admit it.\u201dAdmit? Admit what? Mo Fei gritted his teeth! Damn it! What is wrong with this world?The teacher smiled and said slightly, \u201cMo Fei, since there is a dispute now, you should refine another potion to prove yourself.\u201dYan Chen cut in, \u201cTeacher, he was just lucky.\u201dThe teacher smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Yan Chen. I can tell Mo Fei is always lucky.\u201dMo Fei frowned and started to refine the potion with his face darkened.Xu Zihan looked at Mo Fei pompously, making up his mind to see Mo Fei make a show of himself.But seeing Mo Fei\u2019s smooth movements, Xu Zihan felt a little unsettled.Soon enough another bottle of blue potion appeared in Mo Fei\u2019s hand.Then Mo Fei handed it over to the teacher. The teacher looked at Mo Fei meaningfully and then put it under the detector, which again read a number: 91!Xu Zihan couldn\u2019t believe his eyes, \u201cNo way!\u201dThe teacher then looked at Xu Zihan blandly, \u201cAll right, so many pairs of eyes were staring. Mo Fei has no chance to cheat at all.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d How can it be possible? How could the bumpkin Mo Fei refine higher purity potion than Lin Feiyu?The teacher then looked at Xu Zihan coldly, \u201cInstead of caring whether someone else is cheating or not, you better care whether you can refine qualified potion more. I don\u2019t care whose fianc\u00e9e you are! Whoever fails to refine qualified potion has to write a 10,000-word self-criticism. No repeating sentences!\u201dXu Zihan\u2019s face turned all red because of shame. But he didn\u2019t say anything. He couldn\u2019t afford to offend any teacher of the Imperial College!Yan Chen then swallowed some saliva tensely.Mo Fei patted Yan Chen\u2019s shoulder, \u201cYou can make it!\u201dYan Chen wore a bitter face, looking at Mo Fei pitifully.\u201cThe purity of the potion Mo Fei refined is even higher that Lin Feiyu\u2019s!\u201d\u201cI heard Mo Fei also plays the piano better than Lin Feiyu.\u201d\u201cPeople say the Third Crown Princess can\u2019t even compare with a finger of the First Crown Princess.

    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: An Eye for An EyeLin Feiyu looked at Mo Fei, with something sullen flashing in his eyes.\u201cLin Feiyu\u2019s kind of bad. He is impressive, but it doesn\u2019t mean others can not surpass him! How could he help Xu Zihan slander Mo Fei?\u201d\u201cWhat can you do? In his heart, he should be the No. 1.\u201d\u201cNever expected Mo Fei would be so lucky. How I wish I would be as lucky as him.\u201d\u2026Hearing the rebuking of those classmates around, Lin Feiyu put wrinkles in his brows. The fianc\u00e9e with goddamn bad aptitude the Imperial Consort had picked for Lou Yu kept embarrassing him again and again.Mo Fei peeped at Xu Zihan, with his mouth curling up. He had never eaten humble pie.Now Xu Zihan began to handle the herbs in his hands. His skill of making potions was not outstanding, but far than enough to make level 1 healing potion.Mo Fei secretly released some of his spiritual power to influence Xu Zihan\u2019s operation.Xu Zihan didn\u2019t notice anything when he failed for the first time, and only frowned the second, but became a little nervous when he failed the third time. And the four time Xu Zihan already failed before Mo Fei did anything.The students handed over the potions they mad successively and finished the test, most of whom looked at Xu Zihan surprisingly.Of course Xu Zihan saw them. He was furious in his heart, but he dare not offend any of them because any classmate in this class was either super rich or super powerful.Xu Zihan looked at the last star herb, showing kind of firmness in his eyes.Mo Fei curled up his lips. Having offending Mo Fei, Xu Zihan wouldn\u2019t have a chance.The fifth time Xu Zihan failed again. Now the whole class began to gossip about it.\u201cHe loses again! He loses again!\u201d\u201cSo not his day today!\u201d\u201cWith that bad refining skills, how could he pick a hole in others! So shameless!\u201d\u2026Seeing Xu Zihan lose again, Yan Chen looked every excited, \u201cGreat! Great! Someone will be on my side even if I lose.\u201d Yan Chen pouted and said sullenly, \u201cWhat a shame! We don\u2019t get along. Or I can borrow his self-criticism.\u201dMo Fei then glanced at Yan Chen, \u201cYou still have two more chances. Calm down. Maybe you can pass.\u201dYan Chen cast a glance at Mo Fei and pouted, \u201cWith your luck, maybe I can pass.\u201dMo Fei smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. With me the lucky star here, you will succeed for sure.\u201dYan Chen blinked and nodded heavily.Mo Fei secretly handled the potion with his spiritual power for Yan Chen. And then Yan Chen looked at the potion he made and shouted, \u201cMo Fei, look, look! It\u2019s blue! The potion I refined is blue! Even it\u2019s under 60% purity, it\u2019s already good enough for me to make blue potions!\u201dMo Fei looked at the awful potion in Yan Chen\u2019s hand, \u201cCome on. See if you can pass.\u201dYan Chen nodded and immediately handed it over to the teacher. After the teacher put it under the detector, it read, \u201c65!\u201dThe teacher looked at Yan Chen with her brows knitted, \u201cWith such bad purity, I wouldn\u2019t let it pass if it were someone else. But since it\u2019s you, I will lower the standard. Congrats, you pass!\u201dYan Chen totally ignored the teacher\u2019s satire, and jumped excitedly, \u201cIt\u2019s great! I pass!\u201dLooking at Yan Chen\u2019s overjoyed face, the teacher shook her head, \u201cbehave!\u201dYan Chen scratched his head, with his baby face blushing.And now Xu Zihan felt more ashamed of himself.

Maybe that is true.\u201d said Su Rong after thinking for a while.Lou Yu then shook his head, \u201cI have looked up the Imperial Pharmacopeia. There is no such herbs at all.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d said Su Rong, surprised and bewildered.The Imperial Pharmacopeia covers all the star herbs that have ever been found in Rong Country. How could Mo Fei know something that even isn\u2019t recorded in the Imperial Pharmacopeia? This is weird.\u201cWhere is the handsome at? The handsome guy is here! Here! Look at me!\u201dThe tone-death Mo Fei hummed a song while he walked into Prince Yu Mansion, with Mo Yi following behind, covering his ears.The moment Mo Fei walked in, Lou Yu immediately cast his cold and sharp eyes at him.Mo Fei felt a little uneasy, so he elbowed Mo Yi, \u201cHey, did I do something to make him angry recently?\u201dMo Yi blinked and then looked at Mo Fei innocently, \u201cYoung master, I don\u2019t form a habit peeping you sleep at night, so I don\u2019t know.\u201dMo Fei twitched his lips and then put on a big and shining smile at Lou Yu, saying with falsetto, \u201cMy prince, don\u2019t look at me so affectionately like that! It makes me shy!\u201dLou Yu then put on a bigger and more shining smile, saying gloomily, \u201cYou think I\u2019m looking at you in an affectionate way?\u201dMo Fei immediately answered, \u201cSure! I can only see myself reflected in your pupils. Isn\u2019t it affectionate enough?\u201dSu Rong couldn\u2019t help laughing, while Lou Yu gave him a filthy look.Lou Yu held his chin with his hands, saying, \u201cI heard you were bold enough to molest your potion teacher. You are really \u2018brave\u2019!\u201d\u201cNo, no, you flatter me, my prince.\u201d Mo Fei smiled modestly.Lou Yu then smiled, \u201cSo you think I\u2019m complimenting you?\u201dMo Fei looked at Lou Yu innocently, \u201cSure, didn\u2019t you say I\u2019m brave?\u201dLou Yu snorted, \u201cYou are my wife, but you molested your teacher in class! What do you take me as?

    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: Go back on his WordsTranslator: Guy Gone BadMo Fei nearly spent a whole month making 1,000 formations. And during the whole month\u2019s time, Mo Fei had to not only study hard and exert his ass to cultivate, but also make those formations, totally up to his ears.Finally Mo Fei handed the last bunch of formations to Lou Yu, \u201cThis is the last bunch. Now it\u2019s 1,000 in total. What about the balance payment?\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei blandly, and said pretentiously, \u201cbalance payment? I used it to buy ingredients. And it\u2019s far more than 5 billion. And for the over-spending money, I won\u2019t charge you then.\u201dMo Fei popped his eyes out, \u201cWhat did you say? You son of bitch! You liar! Liar!\u201dHow could such little ingredients worth 5 billion?! He still had felt guilty for the ingredients for his own use before! This asshole has no morals at all!\u201cI said I\u2019ve spent all the money. Don\u2019t you understand?\u201d Prince Yu looked at Mo Fei sullenly.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Mo Fei pounced at Lou Yu.Mo Yi dragged Mo Fei\u2019s arm, saying, \u201cYoung master, calm down. Calm down!\u201dMo Fei shouted, \u201cLet go of me! I\u2019ll challenge him one on one!\u201dMo Yi said, \u201cYoung master, you are not his match.\u201dMo Fei fell into a trance and immediately said, \u201cThen you help me!\u201dMo Fei said awkwardly, \u201cYoung master, we\u2019ll still lose. I won\u2019t make a scene with you.\u201dMo Fei was angry, \u201ccan\u2019t you have some integrity!?\u201dMo Yi force a smile, \u201cYoung master, you said integrity is something you can\u2019t see or touch, something you can neither eat or drink. Why should we have it?\u201dMo Fei glared at Mo Yi while Mo Yi smiled awkwardly.Mo Fei then gave Lou Yu a filthy look, \u201cYou are lucky today!\u201dLou Yu shrugged, watching Mo Fei walk away.Su Rong looked Lou Yu and said, \u201cMy prince, isn\u2019t it a little inappropriate?\u201dLou Yu looked at Su Rong, \u201care you questioning me?\u201dSu Rong shook his head, \u201cOf course not.\u201dLou Yu lowered his head. He also had no choice. He is an unfavored prince. Although his grandpa is a general, he still has a bunch of people to feed. Mo Fei always said he is stingy, so this time he cost all his over 5 billion stars coins, which were all he had.Mo Fei looked at the potion book but couldn\u2019t read a word, face darkened, \u201cDamn it! They all said the imperial family are all reincarnated from foxes. It makes some sense!\u201d\u201cYoung master, please restrain your grief.\u201d comforted Mo Yi.\u201cOutrageous! This is outrageous!\u201d Mo Fei gritted his teeth.Mo Yi looked at the angry Mo Fei, \u201cYoung master, calm down!\u201dMo Fei then snorted, \u201cHow can I calm down? 5 billion! It\u2019s whole 5 billion!\u201d\u201cYoung master, we still have 50 billion. It\u2019s already enough. The top priority now is how to improve your power. After you become a top master, even if Prince Yu goes back on his words again, you can beat him till he yields.\u201d said Mo Yi.Mo Fei nodded like being awakened, \u201cYeah, you are right. Our top priority is not money but try hard to cultivate. Only if we become strong could we defeat those assholes!\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cYeah, yeah, yeah. That\u2019s what I am trying to say. Young master, you are so smart!\u201dNow having an aim, Mo Fei became much motivated.Except having classes every day, he would make use of his spare time to cultivate and refine potions to improve his constitution.One day Su Rong looked at Lou Yu, \u201cMy prince, now you\u2019ve got a thousand formations. Can you spare 7 or 8 for me?\u201dLou Yu looked at Su Rong with his eyes raised, \u201cWhat?\u201dLou Yu\u2019s voice make Su Rong\u2019s hair upside down, \u201c4 or 5 will also do.\u201dLou Yu smiled, while Su Rong also forced a smile.\u201d\u201cFor the old time\u2019s sake, 90 million for one.\u201d said Lou Yu while looking at Su Rong.Su Rong popped his eyes out.

I will sell those formations at the price of 100 million for one. So you should buy as early as you can.

But I\u2018m only into women.\u201dAfter Mo Fei sat down, Yan Chen grasped Mo Fei\u2019s arm kind of excitedly, \u201cMo Fei, do you know about the cultivating formation?\u201dMo Fei frowned and asked him like he knew nothing, \u201ccultivating formation?\u201dYan Chen nodded, then took out a Star Newspaper and said with erethism, \u201cYeah! Cultivating formation! Lejie Lab has exerted their utmost effort for ten years and finally developed it successfully.\u201dMo Fei popped out his eyes and asked with astonishment, \u201cOh my, ten years! Really not easy!\u201dYan Chen nodded, \u201cYeah. It\u2019s said one could double his cultivating speed with it. It only costs them ten years to develop such good stuff. Lejie Lab is really impressive!\u201dMo Fei smiled, \u201cYeah, yeah, so impressive.\u201d But it was he who had made those cultivating formations, which totally had nothing to do with the goddamn Lejie Lab!\u201cIn the releasing statement of Lejie Lab, the ingredients to make the cultivating formations were found in a mysterious realm, extremely rare. Now the mysterious realm has been closed. The ingredients in the lab are only enough for make 1,000. So anyone who wants it has to reserve as soon as possible.\u201d said Yan Chen with his eyes turning red.Even Mo Fei nearly bought it! Oh my! Those braggadocios!After swallowing some saliva, Mo Fei asked, \u201cHow many star coins does one formation cost?\u201dYan Chen said flatly, \u201c128,880,000 star coins.\u201dMo Fei couldn\u2019t believe his ears, \u201cSo expensive? Is there any buyer?\u201dYan Chen rolled his eyes, \u201cit\u2019s not expensive at all. Only 100 million. Cultivating magic weapons like this, it could be sold even at a triple price.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d He was still too green a pumpkin who didn\u2019t know about rich people\u2019s world.Over 120 million for one!

Lejie Lab belongs to Ji Family and now is under Prince Yu\u2019s name. I can only buy it through Prince Yu.\u201dMo Fei said with kind of doubt, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you directly buy from him?\u201dYan Chen shook his head, \u201cYou may not get one even if you have the star coins. They first accept reservations and then select the qualified ones. One big family could only buy three at most. Our family opens restaurants. We\u2019ve got the star coins but our social status may not be qualified.\u201dMo Fei frowned, \u201caren\u2019t there 1,000?\u201dYan Chen shook his head, \u201conly 1,000! Far from enough! The royal families, the militaries, so many big financial groups of Rong Kingdom, and those 7 and 8 level star magicians!

Over 100 billion!\u201cMo Fei, Mo Fei.\u201dYan Chen\u2019s calling brought Mo Fei\u2019s flying mind.Mo Fei then turned to Yan Chen, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201dYan Chen blinked his eyes and rubbed his hands awkwardly, \u201cwell, the cultivating formation.\u201dMo Fei wore a smile, \u201cyou mean the formation? OK. I will ask Prince Yu about it.\u201dOn hearing Mo Fei, Yan Chen got thrilled, \u201cit\u2019s awesome!\u201dYan Chen then took out a card and gave it to Mo Fei, \u201chere is 150 million star coins. The left is your reward.\u201dMo Fei looked at the glittering gold card and nodded, \u201cI will try my best.\u201d\u201cYan Chen, how could you ask that guy\u2019s favor. You really think he is related to Prince Yu since they got married? Everyone knows Prince Yu doesn\u2019t care about him at all. He doesn\u2019t like him. Don\u2019t you know that? The betrothal gifts were only a box of level 1 star herbs. This guy is from the countryside. You gave your star card to him? He may run away with it.\u201d said Xu Zihan sharply.Mo Fei then looked at Xu Zihan coldly, \u201cwhen is it your turn to put your nose into our young master\u2019s business?\u201dXu Zihan looked at Mo Yi bitterly, \u201care you his dog? Why are you barking at me?\u201dMo Yi said, \u201cI don\u2019t give it a shit who you are. It\u2019s not right to make trouble for our young master without any reason!\u201dXu Zihan snorted, \u201cbumpkins are bumpkins! How dare a servant like you talk to me this way?\u201dMo Fei sneered, \u201cwhat the bullshit are you? It\u2019s already your honor that I talk to you.\u201dXu Zihan\u2019s face changed a bit, \u201cMo Fei, you are good, you are good, you are all good.\u201dMo Fei smiled slightly, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. I\u2019m all good. I know that. I don\u2019t need you to tell me.\u201dXu Zihan then turned to Yan Chen, \u201cYan Chen, ask your star card back if you are smart enough. Otherwise, you may spend your star coins for nothing.\u201dYan Chen frowned, \u201cthank you for your care. But I choose to trust Mo Fei. Besides, just 150 million.\u201d\u201cAll right, all right. It seems I am the bad guy here. Someday you\u2019d cry.\u201d said Xu Zihan indifferently.Mo Fei then raised his eyebrows, \u201cthis guy is really a pervert, thinking the whole world is under his command. If someday he got divorced, I\u2019m gonna LOL, hahaha\u2026\u201dYan Chen, \u201c\u2026\u201dXu Zihan\u2019s face turned all red, \u201chum! Mo Fei, you should worry about yourself. Prince Yu will definitely divorce you someday!\u201dMo Fei laughed at Xu Zihan arrogantly, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to worry about us.\u201dMo Fei then raised his voice, \u201cwho wants a cultivating formation? Pay here! I\u2019ll only ask once! Only once!\u201dA few people looked at Mo Fei suspiciously on hearing him.Mo Fei noticed quite a few people were hooked. He thought, \u201ccultivating formation is really popular here. So many people would like to be swindled willingly.\u201dXu Zihan looked at Mo Fei and ridiculed, \u201cdo you want to earn some quick money and run away?\u201dMo Fei glanced at Xu Zihan lazily, \u201cdoes it have anything to do with you?\u201dSome people drew back on hearing Xu Zihan\u2019s words.At this time, a young man took out a star card and put it on Mo Fei\u2019s desk after looking at Mo Fei for some time silently, \u201cit has 150 million star coins in it.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cHm? So the left will also be my reward?\u201dThe young man nodded and said poker-faced, \u201cyes.\u201dMo Fei then smiled, \u201ctrust me.

I\u2019m just using the money to bet a chance. I can afford it.\u201dOn hearing the young man\u2019s words, Mo Fei thought to himself, \u201cwhat a bunch of rich people!\u201d\u201cAnybody? It\u2019s really a rare chance. It\u2019s now or never.

For the family title, the young generation would haggle over every bit of resources, let alone such a magic weapon that could greatly improve their cultivating speed.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cthat makes sense.\u201dMo Yi narrowed his eyes. He had five formations in his hands, which were worth 500 million! Mo Fei suddenly realized he could be rendered as \u00a0a man of wealth now.Mo Fei said jealously, \u201cthis time Prince Yu is gonna make great fortune overnight!\u201dMo Fei narrowed his eyes. He could accept it that Prince Yu would make a great fortune. If he himself made a great fortune like this, it\u2019d soon be his doomsday. He is so smart, but destined to be poor. So pathetic!\u201cLord Mo Fei, you are back!\u201d welcomed Su Rong excitedly.Looking at Su Rong\u2019s smiling face, Mo Fei subconsciously raised his vigilance. One who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions! He must be up to something. The smile was so similar because he also wore that smile when he set other people up.\u201cSu Rong, what do you want?\u201d said Mo Fei while blinking that pair of innocent eyes.Su Rong rubbed his hands and looked at Mo Fei trucklingly.Su Rong, \u201cAre you hungry? I\u2019ve prepared some dishes for you.\u201dMo Fei, \u201cNah.\u201dSu Rong, \u201cDo you feel sour in your shoulders? Let me give you a massage.\u201dMo Fei, \u201cNo, thanks.\u201dSu Rong, \u201cDo you feel hot? Let me fan for you.\u201dMo Fei, \u201cNo need!\u201d\u2026Mo Fei suddenly felt those words were very familiar. It seemed that not long ago he himself also sucked up to the asshole Lou Yu like this.Mo Fei looked at Su Rong and said, \u201cWhat do you want from me? Rongrong, just shoot.\u201dSu Rong nodded, \u201cAll right. Lord Mo Fei, is it possible you could sell two more cultivating formations to me?\u201dMo Fei smiled.Su Rong also smiled along with him awkwardly.Mo Fei said a little shyly, \u201cOf course. But, 150 million each.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Su Rong opened his mouth wide.Mo Fei then smiled brightly, \u201cYeah, yeah, yeah, you heard it right. 150 million each!\u201dSu Rong\u2019s face was a little twisted, \u201cbut wasn\u2019t it 10 million for one not long ago?\u201dMo Fei then patted Su Rong\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cRongrong, 10 million for one was already a long time ago. The prices of all commodities are skyrocketing. The price of such good stuff would definitely rise.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201d But isn\u2019t it increasing too fast?!\u201c150 million? Isn\u2019t it too expensive?\u201d Su Rong looked at Mo Fei pathetically.Mo Fei smiled at Su Rong with a kind and pleasant countenance, \u201cWhat is the cultivating formation? It\u2019s something that has cost Lejie Lab over ten years\u2019 time and over a hundreds of researchers\u2019 hard work. It has condensed the hard work of over a few hundreds of researchers. The ingredients they adopted were all from the mysterious realm which have already been used up. No one knows when they can find such precious materials again. Maybe a few hundred years? Now do you still think 150 million is too much? Huh?\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201d These words may work on others, but not him\u2026Since Su Rong didn\u2019t say anything, Mo Yi leaned forward and said, \u201cCome on! It\u2019s not expensive at all. Masterpiece like this is a now-or-never thing. Someone even would like to pay 200 million and even 300 million for it.\u201dMo Fei looked at Su Rong jauntily, \u201cyoung man, you still have a long way to go.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201d He had thought Mo Fei might be a little more conscientious than Prince Yu! Maybe something went wrong with his head at that time.Mo fei smiled, \u201cRongrong, do you want it or not?\u201dSu Rong then smiled awkwardly, \u201cmy lord, can I get a discount?\u201d\u201cDiscount is for those rejects below the table. Cultivating formation takes the high-end route. How could I give you a discount?\u201d Mo Fei looked at Su Rong unhappily.\u201cMy lord, can I write an IOU?\u201d asked Su Rong.Mo Fei shook his head, \u201cno.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Su Rong.Mo Fei replied, \u201cI also owe others\u2019 money!

Now Mo Fei was rich, so he was really good to himself, buying all kind of pricey star herbs for his own cultivation.Mo Fei\u2019s constitution had already improved to a normal standard. Nursing his body with all kinds of potions, Mo Fei\u2019s aptitude had almost reached Su Rong\u2019s level.Mo Fei narrowed his eyes, cultivating the Ten Thousand Star Sorcery which he obtained by chance. This sorcery could rendered as advanced one, a few times more powerful than that of the Daybreak Star.Mo Fei believed that through his unremitting cultivation, soon enough he could make breakthrough and advance to a level 2 star magician and at that time he could step Lou Yu the asshole under his feet.Mo Fei couldn\u2019t help chuckling when picturing the scene he threw a punch right in Lou Yu\u2019s face.Su Rong now got a little jealous on hearing Mo Fei\u2019s laugh upstairs.Mo Fei looked at Su Rong and asked, \u201cwhere is Prince Yu? Why didn\u2019t I see him?\u201dSu Rong forced a bitter smile, \u201cthe prince has gone to General Ji\u2019s place. Too many big shots want to pull the string. The prince could only go to the general\u2019s place to avoid them.\u201dMo Yi narrowed his eyes, saying contemplatively, \u201cit seems the cultivation formations can not only rake in money but also rope in some people.\u201dSu Rong smiled awkwardly, \u201che can rope in some people, but meanwhile, he may also offend some inevitably.\u201dMo Yi sneered, \u201c save it! Don\u2019t pretend being mistreated after gaining a favor!\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dSu Rong looked at Mo Yi while rubbing his hands, \u201cMo Yi, can you say some nice words for me before your young master, so he can sell me the cultivating formation at a lower price?\u201dMo Yi replied while shaking his head without thinking, \u201cno!\u201d\u201cBut why?\u201d asked Su Rong.Mo Yi smiled, \u201cbecause the mission the young master gave me is to kick your ass as easy as pie within three months. So it\u2019s better you stay weak.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201d What? This goddamn master and servant duo!Su Rong forced a smile, \u201cactually you don\u2019t need to think too much. You are so powerful. How would I be ever your rival?\u201dMo Yi laughed complacently, \u201cI also think you are not my rival now. But better safe than sorry. I still should be cautious.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201d What? This son of bitch!Mo Yi waved his hand at Su Rong, \u201cTime for me to cultivate.\u201dWatching Mo Yi fade away, Su Rong gritted his teeth sullenly, thinking, \u201cdamn it! Fish begins to rot from the head. It really makes sense.\u201dSu Rong looked down despondently. Everyone around him is asking his favor to buy the cultivating formation. But what they don\u2019t know is it\u2019s already very difficult for himself to buy one.If he had known that the crown princess was so black-hearted, he should have bought as many as he could with everything he had when Prince Yu asked whether he wanted to buy it at the price of 90 million.Su Rong\u2019s face was darkened, thinking, \u201cthose assholes thought Prince Yu and Mo Fei don\u2019t match?

This guy was going to be super rich!Lou Yu wore a cold face and said, \u201che names such a high price but people still would like to pay.\u201d And a long line!1,000 cultivating formations seemed quite a lot, but there were so many big financial groups, so many cultivating masters out there. They were far from enough.It was said five formations together would have the best effect, which could improve nearly four times cultivation speed.General Ji planned to build a few cultivation buildings specially for the soldiers to cultivate. So those soldiers would all draw closer to Ji Family.\u201cHasn\u2019t Lin Fei said anything about the cultivating formation? He and Lou Yu were childhood sweethearts.

But for the cultivating formation thing, the other two old men both came to suck him up, which made him pretty cocky.\u201cGrandson, where did you get those cultivating formations?\u201d asked Ji Anguo curiously.Lou Yu smiled slightly, \u201cmy lab worked it out.\u201dJi Anguo twitched his mouth disapprovingly, \u201call right. I\u2019ll take it as you said.\u201dLou Yu said seriously, \u201cgrandpa, it\u2019s really been refined in the lab.\u201dJi Anguo nodded his head and said reluctantly, \u201call right, all right. Of course it\u2019s developed in the lab. Those people in the lab are really sought-after. Numerous people are trying to undermine them, I heard.\u201dIn Ji Anguo\u2019s eyes were flashing with something teasing.Lou Yu forced a smile, \u201creally?\u201dJi Anguo nodded, \u201cyeah! A bunch of shameless people flock together to steal them. And the remuneration they give is pretty high, which even makes me a little jealous! Those goddamn regals are really super rich.\u201dLou Yu smiled, \u201clet it be. Anyway, for so many years those people in the lab haven\u2019t worked out so many useful stuffs. It\u2019s good they all go, saving me a lot of money to support them.\u201dJi Anguo smiled, \u201csome of them already couldn\u2019t resist the fat salary and got scooped away.\u201dLou Yu smiled, \u201creally? Such a high salary, I don\u2019t know whether that bunch of people would have the luck to enjoy.\u201dJi Anguo looked at Lou Yu and asked, \u201cwhat about you and your wife recently?\u201dLou Yu smiled, \u201cwell, not bad.\u201dJi Anguo narrowed his eyes, \u201cnever expected the person that woman picked for you turns out to be pretty good.\u201dLou Yu smiled, \u201cyeah! I should thank her.\u201dLou Yu lowered his head, showing a ray of sneering at the corner of his lips. Once the cultivating formations were released, Na Lanyue fell sick because of huge anger.

I heard Prince Yu even turned his big brother Prince Feng down. I think you should drop the idea forever.\u201d some classmate said.\u201cThat\u2019s different! Prince Feng is his brother, while Lou Yu is his wife. Anyway, his wife is closer to him.\u201d said Yan Chen.\u201cIt\u2019d be great if he is the one on Prince Yu\u2019s heart. Pity that they have no relationship foundation at all. Their marriage is destined to be a deal.\u201dYan Chen disapproved, \u201cMo Fei is pretty good in my eyes at least.

I bet Prince Yu hasn\u2019t agreed.\u201d said Xu Zihan full of confidence.Mo Fei then came before Yan Chen and sat down, then took out a cultivating formation and gave it to Yan Chen.When Mo Fei took out the formation, everyone was shocked with their eyes wide open.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With some pillow talk, and he gave it to me.\u201d\u201cPillow talk?\u201d Xu Zifeng couldn\u2019t help sneering, \u201cI bet your formation wouldn\u2019t come from a decent way.\u201dMo Fei just ignored him.Yan Chen then put on a bright smile, \u201cI already heard pillow talk is the most persuasive talk. Now it turns out to be true.\u201dThen Mo Fei handed over the other one to Shangguan Tianxing. Shanguan Tianxing cast a glance at Mo Fei surprisingly and then walked away after taking it.A few classmates looked at Yan Chen and Shangguan Tianxing, with all jealousy in their eyes.\u201cMo Fei, here is 150 million\u2026\u201d\u201cSorry, I got none.\u201d smiled Mo Fei, saying sullenly, \u201cthere are only 1,000 in total. My ability is limited. I can\u2019t get more.\u201dMo Fei laughed in his beard, thinking, \u201cI told you it\u2019s now or never. Now you regret it? Do you think my words are bullshit? A bunch of jackasses! I am a man of my word!\u201dLou Yu was so petty. He might turn a blind eye if he resold one or two secretly. But if more, that guy would have a cow!One has to bow under the eave!Lou Yu is really annoying. The worst thing is he and Mo Yi together are still not his match.Yan Chen was playing with the formation, with all joys on his chubby face.While Shangguan Tianxing was looking at the formation in his hands, there wasn\u2019t big change of the expression on his face. But deep in his eyes, one could still tell he was overjoyed.Most classmates looked the two with jealousy.Some had the heart to buy one, but dropped the idea by Xu Zihan\u2019s words. Now they were all looking at Xu Zihan with raging fire in their eyes.Xu Zihan also felt humiliated. He never expected Mo Fei really sqeezed two formations out of Prince Yu!Looking at the formations in Yan Chen and Shangguan Tianxing\u2019s hands, some beautiful wives couldn\u2019t hold it.\u201cMo Fei, you are Prince Yu\u2019s wife. He cares you the most. You will find a way\u2026maybe\u2026you know\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah! Mo Fei, you and Prince Yu are newly married, like the glue now. It would be an easy thing for you to get some more.\u201d\u201cMo Fei, do us a favor. You got two so easily. It wouldn\u2019t be a big thing to get a few more.\u201dMo Fei blinked. Wow! For the cultivating formations, those hot chicks even said such words even ghosts wouldn\u2019t believe. Really\u2026moral degeneration\u2026but he likes it!Mo Fei then said shyly, \u201cJust because I am his wife, I should think in his shoes! He is very busy now. If he gives you, he\u2019ll offend others. I feel so sorry for him that I even have no mood to eat or to sleep. How am I supposed to add more trouble for him now? Otherwise, how would our relationship last long? I am a considerate and virtuous wife. I can\u2019t embarrass him. He cares about me, of course I should repay him.\u201dMo Yi looked at Mo Fei, eyebrows raised, thinking, \u201cyoung master is young master. Just lying through his teeth.\u201dHe had no mood to eat or sleep? Mo Yi smiled, speechless. He still remembered when Prince Yu wasn\u2019t home yesterday, the young master was in a very good mood and ate up all the dishes last night, and even had a giant cake as dessert, and drank three jorums of beverages, which stunned Su Rong like he saw a wolf!Mo Fei lowered his head, thinking, \u201cAlas, how could I say such nasty words? I really should go back and brush my teeth!\u201dXu Zihan looked at Mo Fei, \u201cMo Fei, I would like to pay 300 million.\u201dMo Fei raised his head, looked at Xu Zihan\u2019s cocky face and sneered. Money isn\u2019t everything! Don\u2019t be so cocky! Asshole!Mo Fei then smiled slightly, \u201c300 million? In the black market the cultivating formation\u2019s price is ramping to 1 billion! But\u2026it\u2019s out of stock now. With such little money, I even have no guts to open my mouth. But if you can pay 3 billion, maybe I can help you ask about it.\u201d\u201c3 billion? You are blackmailing me!\u201d said Xu Zihan with his face turning red.Mo Fei smiled, \u201conly 3 billion! You are so rich. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Or you don\u2019t have that much?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Xu Zihan felt really humiliated, face reddened.Lin Fei yu got up and said to Mo Fei, \u201cMo Fei, the cultivating formation isn\u2019t worth 3 billion at all. We are all classmates. You can ensnare us.\u201dMo Fei then smiled, \u201cClassmate Lin, don\u2019t make it so serious! I didn\u2019t force him to buy. I just provide a price for him to refer to. If he can\u2019t pay, I wouldn\u2019t force him. There aren\u2019t many rich people in the world, but there are too many people pretending to be rich. Pity that my eyes are not bright enough to distinguish them.\u201dYan Chen nearly couldn\u2019t help laughing on hearing Mo Fei\u2019s theory.Xu Zihan\u2019s face turned all red. He then shouted, \u201cMo Fei, you\u2019ve gone too far.\u201dLin Feiyu then cast a glance at Xu Zihan, \u201cZihan, don\u2019t argue with him. About the formation, I\u2019ll help you ask Prince Yu about it.\u201dXu Zihan immediately put on a claptrap smile, \u201cOk.

Her gentle face was arrogant and her eyes were disdainful.Mo Fei picked her eyebrows. Did he despise me?Hehe, young man, you would regret it!Several classmates of them looked at Xu Zihan admiringly. Lin Feiyu\u2019s relationship with Prince Yu was known to all.Although Lin Feiyu refused the proposal of Prince Yu, the latter was still very good to her, they were friends since they were young, it was hard for them to break off their relations.Yan Chen frowned and muttered in a low voice, \u201cWhat is there to be cocky of? He has already been engaged with Prince Feng, but still doesn\u2019t draw a clear line with Prince Yu, He is so easy.\u201dMo Fei looked at Yan Chen and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t like her?\u201dYan Chen said discontentedly, \u201cHe always puts on an act.\u201dMo Fei was speechless, but Yan Chen truly got the point.Lin Feiyu lowered her head and could not help but feel a little sad in his heart. The cultivation formation was such a big thing. Having known each other for so many years, Lou Yu had not revealed to him any word. Was Lou Yu taking precautions against her?So Lin Fei Yu went to find Lou Yu right after the class.Shortly after Lin Feiyu left, Su Rong drove by and stopped in front of Mo Fei and Mo Yi.Seeing Mo Fei, Su Rong said with some joy, \u201cLord Mo, you are looking for me?\u201dMo Fei nodded and then said, \u201cYes! There is something for you.\u201dSu Rong said gallantly, \u201cWhat can I do for you, please?\u201dMurphy smiled, \u201cI\u2019m going to find the prince.\u201dSu Rong nodded and asked curiously, \u201cFor what, if I may ask?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re husband and wife, of course, love affairs, you know.\u201d Mo Fei said with some sort of shyness.Su Rong could not help but shivered and thought to himself: Lord Mo Fei, are you questioning my IQ by telling such a lie?Although Su Rong\u2019s heart was full of disapprobation, he still made a good disguise on the surface, \u201cIt is a good time for you, the newly married couple, to enhance your feelings.\u201dMo Fei nodded and said, \u201cYes! That\u2019s exactly what I think.\u201dMo Fei and Mo Yi then hopped in Su Rong\u2019s star car. Su Rong couldn\u2019t help looking at Mo Fei and said, \u201cIs it true, Lord Mo Fei? As long as I send you there, you will give me another formation?\u201dMo Fei blinked and asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d\u201cHow could it be? I trust you most.\u201d Su Rong complimented.Mo Fei smiled, \u201cSince you trust me so much, you will certainly have a better future than Lou Yu.\u201dSu Rong felt awkward and smiled, \u201cI don\u2019t have that ability! You really flattered me.\u201dMo Fei grinned, \u201cDon\u2019t be so insecure. At least, your eyes were sharper than that guy.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dLin Fei Yu walked into the General\u2019s Masion. After searching for a long time, he finally found Lou Yu.Lou Yu had a thick pile of orders at hand.Seeing Lin Feiyu, Lou Yu\u2019s face showed a somewhat complicated color, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dLin Fei Yu smiled and said coquettishly, \u201cI\u2019ve come to see you, brother Lou Yu. Don\u2019t you welcome me?\u201dThe smile on Lou Yu\u2019s face was somewhat bitter, \u201cHow come? Why do I not welcome you?\u201dLin Fei Yu looked at the pile of orders in his hands and frowned, \u201cBrother Lou Yu, what are these?\u201d\u201cAnyone who wants to buy a cultivating formation needs to submit an application document. Here are all the application documents I received.\u201d Lou Yu explained.Lin Fei Yu frowned and said with a smile, \u201cBrother Lou Yu, you are really good to Mo Fei!\u201dLou Yu raised his eyebrows and asked, \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201dLin Feiyu seemed to say unintentionally, \u201cEven those big consortiums of Rong Kingdom and those top martial artists would have to hand in their application materials if they want to buy a cultivation formation. However, when Mo Fei wants a cultivating formation, you just gave two to her. But do you know he sold it to two students in our class at the price of 150 million?\u201dLou Yu frowned and felt a little angry, but when he thought that he had not told Mo Fei that she could not sell the formations to others, he simply said, \u201cIs that so? He is my wife, and naturally he can enjoy some privileges.\u201dLin Feiyu\u2019s heart flushed with surprise, although Mo Fei had two cultivating formations, but Lin Feiyu always felt their origin was questionable, he could not say for sure that they were Mo Fei\u2019s stolen goods, but he had not expect that Lou Yu\u2026If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Brother Lou Yu, when was the cultivating formation developed?\u201dLou Yu gave Lin Feiyu a thoughtful look and said, \u201cOnly recently. What\u2019s the problem with it?\u201dLin Feiyu blinked her black eyes and said, \u201cNo, brother Lou Yu, can you sell\u2026\u201d\u201cMy sweetheart!\u201d A tender call like flowing water interrupted Lin Feiyu\u2019s words.Both Lou Yu and Lin Feiyu looked at the door at the same time. Mo Fei was leaning against the door and looked at Lou Yu and Lin Feiyu in an amorous way.Lin Feiyu\u2019s expression could not help changing.Lou Yu frowned and said, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Sweetheat? It was really weird that this appellation coming from Mo Fei\u2019s mouth.Mo Fei walked toward Lou Yu with lightsome steps. Then he stopped behind Lou Yu and hugged him around the neck. \u201cOf course I came to see you. I heard you were too busy to eat, and my heart was all tangled up. Work is important, but you should care for your own health. My prince, you must take care of yourself! Otherwise, I will be distressed to death.\u201dLou Yu smiled faintly and looked at Mo Fei, his heart was all tangled up? He was worried about me? Yesterday, he slept in his grandfather\u2019s home. And after Mo Fei heard that, he jumped three feet high happily and rolled around the room satisfactorily.Mo Fei took a glance at Lin Feiyu as if he had just seen him, \u201cIt turns out that the first Crown Princess is also here! It\u2019s good that I came. Otherwise, you two, in one room, and who knows what kind of rumors would be spread out!?\u201d\u201cRumors? What rumors can I have with Feiyu?\u201d Lou Yu said coldly.Mo Fei chuckled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my prince, I believe in your innocence.\u201dLou Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Fei then put the cake he bought on the way here on the table and said, \u201cI know you are hungry. So I bought you a cake. You can try it.\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei and did not move.Mo Fei smiled brightly and said with an intentionally squeezed voice, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you eat? Do you want me to feed you? How naughty you are!\u201dLou Yu opened his mouth and ate the cake Mo Fei handed to his mouth. However, Mo Fei looked at Lou Yu with a little surprise. Well, this guy really ate it?\u201cGive me the spoon.\u201d The tone of Lou Yu was a bit cold.Hearing what Lou Yu said, Mo Fei tamely handed the spoon to him.Lou Yu ate the cake in large chunks. Soon enough the cake which cost Mo Fei 30,000 star coins was eaten up.Mo Fei\u2019s face was a little twisted, crying in his heart, \u201cdamn it! This is supposed to be my supper!\u201d Didn\u2019t Su Rong say Lou You doesn\u2019t like sweets? It looked like this bastard lied about the military intelligence.Lou Yu looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cYou look a little unhappy. Is it because I ate your cake?\u201dMo Fei chuckled, \u201cHow could it be! You think too much, I\u2019m just worried about you! You must be starving since you eat so fast.\u201d\u201cNo, actually I have just eaten something, just don\u2019t want to disappoint your\u2026 kindness.\u201d Lou Yu stared at Mo Fei. He seemed to be gnashing his teeth as he spoke.Mo Fei\u2019s mouth twitched. He had just eaten something and had finished her whole cake. Was this guy a pig?\u201cIf you have nothing to do, you can go.\u201d Lou Yu urged.Mo Fei said disapprovingly, \u201cNo. I\u2019ll stay and watch over you. My heart is like missing a piece and feels very empty if I can\u2019t see you. As long as I am by your side, my mood will stabilize.\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei\u2019s sincere expression and felt enormously sick.Mo Fei looked at Lin Feiyu and said, \u201cYour Grace, is there anything I can do for you?\u201dLin Feiyu looked at Mo Fei and said with some embarrassment, \u201cBrother Lou Yu, I\u2019d like to buy some formations from you.\u201dLou Yu then asked, \u201cHow many do you want?\u201dLin Feiyu considered for a moment. Lou Feng needed one, so did Lou Jing. And he also promised Xu Zihan to get him one. In addition, he himeself also needed one, because the superposition of formations would add up the cultivation results. \u201cTen, I guess.\u201d Lin Feiyu named a conservative figure.Mo Fei\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cTen!?\u201dHer heart filled with chill, this guy had a lion\u2019s mouth, \u201cYour Grace is really a good wife. More than half of the formations you ask for are for your fianc\u00e9 I guess.\u201dLin Feiyu frowned and looked at Mo Fei unfriendly.Mo Fei smiled calmly, totally ignoring the other party\u2019s bitter expression.Prince Yu, these two words deeply stung Lou Yu\u2019s heart, his face became some sort of unease.\u201cI need it myself.\u201d Lin Feiyu said.\u201cThe simultaneous operation of those formations will consume star cores. Two are already enough for you to cultivate. Otherwise, it would be too wasteful.\u201d Mo Fei\u2019s voice was casual.Lin Fei Yu did not look at Mo Fei, but focused his eyes on Lou Yu instead.Lou Yu\u2019s face revealed kind of hesitation.Mo Fei looked at Lou Yu and felt resentful!

    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: I Am Helping You!\u201cA cultivating formation costs over 120 million. It\u2019s not cheap.\u201d said Mo Fei while blinking.Lin Feiyu ignored Mo Fei, but turned to Lou Yu and said with a coquettish tone, \u201cBrother Lou Yu, I\u2019m short of money recently. Can you give me a discount?\u201dBefore Lou Yu answered, Mo Fei cut in, \u201cDiscount? Of course. I met Su Rong on my way here. Su Rong said you are a good man and gives him a ten percent cut. You all grew up together. You can not make fish of one and flesh of another.\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei with a complicated expression.Lin Feiyu didn\u2019t know what to say. He only held the grudge in his heart. Only ten percent off? It\u2019s still very expensive. With Mo Fei here, he wouldn\u2019t make a bargain today.Lou Yu looked at Lin Feiyu and said, \u201cThe cultivating formations have been sold out. Give me two days, and I\u2019ll see if I can spare two for you.\u201dLin Feiyu nodded, and smiled gently, \u201cAll right. Thank you very much, brother Lou Yu.\u201dLou Yu nodded, \u201cMy pleasure.\u201dLin Feiyu then turned around and left. Watching him leave, Mo Fei looked a little cocky like he won this round.After Lin Feiyu left, only Lou Yu and Mo Fei were left in the room.\u201cMo Fei, what the hell do you want? Huh?\u201d asked Lou Yu with an unfriendly tone.Mo Fei said flatly, \u201cTake it easy. I am helping you!\u201dLou Yu snorted, \u201cHelping me? Helping me with what?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you like him? I\u2019m helping you chase him!\u201d said Mo Fei reasonably.\u201cYou call this chasing him?\u201d questioned Lou Yu.Mo Fei nodded, \u201cSure! The most precious thing in this world is something you can\u2019t get and something you have lost. I\u2019m helping you become something he has lost. When he feels that you no longer love him, he would naturally grow feelings for you. Maybe in a few days, he is going to dump Prince Feng and chase after you. You know, everyone is bitchy.\u201dLou Yu said blandly, \u201cTotally bullshit!\u201dMo Fei said disapprovingly, \u201cBullshit? It\u2019s not bullshit! As the saying goes, wife is inferior to concubine, and concubine is inferior to cheating, and cheating is inferior to failing to cheat. Your problem is your unrequited love, which makes him take you as a backup.\u201d\u201cShut up! Feiyu is not that kind of person. \u201csaid Lou Yu testily.\u201cAs far as I know, this is the inborn bad quality of human. Do you mean Lin Feiyu isn\u2019t human?\u201d said Mo Fei, confused.\u201cShut up! What do you know?\u201d said Lou Yu.Mo Fei said coldly, \u201cAll right. I know nothing. You\u2019re an expert. You are omniscient. Then why did you get dumped?\u201d\u201cHe takes me as an elder brother, not that kind of feeling.\u201d said Lou Yu.Mo Fei then laughed, \u201ctrust me. Do as what I told you, and he will no longer take you as his elder brother. I am an old hand, quite experienced. You have a lot to learn from me, young man.\u201dLou Yu then chuckled, \u201cYeah! You, Mr. Mo, got rejected 17 times in a row. You are indeed experienced.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d Asshole! You wouldn\u2019t end up well!\u201cLou Yu, you like pretending to be rich, and supporting other\u2019s wife, I\u2019m OK with it. But don\u2019t get me humiliated. Otherwise I will also pretend to be rich and interfere your business. We\u2019ll be internecine. Don\u2019t blame me then.\u201d threatened Mo Fei.Lou Yu looked at Mo Fei gloomily, \u201care you threatening me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just reminding you.\u201d said Mo Fei coldly.Lou Yu got furious and threw a punch at Mo Fei.Mo Fei moved his waist and dodged that punch! Asshole! Seriously?\u201cHelp! Help!\u201d shouted Mo Fei.Boom! Mo Yi broke in and stood before Mo Fei.Su Rong also followed in, looking frightened, \u201cStop! Stop! It should be a mistake.\u201dLou Yu then threw another punch at Mo Fei, while Mo Fei ran out, frightened, with Mo Yi following behind.Mo Fei made up his mind, thinking, \u201cYou started this!

After this, it will leave a stain in Prince Yu\u2019s glorious life.\u201dSeeing Lou Yu didn\u2019t chase after, Mo Fei exhaled a long breath of relief.Mo Yi looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cYoung master, is it really good to slander Prince Yu like that?\u201dMo Fei glared at Mo Yi and said, \u201cHe tried to beat me! Anyone who beats me would never end up well!\u201d He still showed some mercy this time. If he was merciless enough, he would shout that Lou Yu has sexual impotence!Mo Yi nodded and said, \u201cAll right.\u201dAt this time an old man walked towards them with his hands clasped behind the back. Feeling the old man\u2019s breaths, Mo Fei subconsciously raised his vigilance, looking at the old man.Mo Fei sized up the old man, thinking he looked kind of familiar, but didn\u2019t remember who.Looking at Mo Fei\u2019s confusing expression, Mo Yi knew that Mo Fei had no idea who the old man was at all.\u201cYoung master, he is General Ji.\u201d Mo Yi tipped Mo Fei with a pretty low voice.But Mo Yi\u2019s voice was so low that Mo Fei didn\u2019t hear him clearly, \u201cWho did you say he is?\u201dJi Anguo raised his eyebrows, smiling, \u201cYou may not know me. I am Lou Yu\u2019s grandpa, and also your grandpa.\u201dWith his hands behind, Ji Anguo smiled like a shopkeeper. Mo Fei gave a hollow laugh, having a spur to dig a pit for himself to jump in.Mo Fei thought desperately, \u201ctop master Ji Anguo of Rong Kingdom, my husband\u2019s grandpa. I failed to recognize him! This is so goddamn embarrassing!\u201dThen Mo Fei sucked up, \u201cwow, it\u2019s grandpa! I have long heard of your big name. I didn\u2019t expect you look so noble and dignified! Far from looking like a dying man at all.\u201dJi Anguo, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Fei then wore a repulsing expression! Oh god! Is this also a way to praise someone?Mo Fei also noticed that his words were a little inappropriate, \u201cgrandpa, I mean, you look so young.\u201dJi Anguo, \u201creally?\u201d\u201cYes, sure!\u201d said Mo Fei while nodding his head like a chicken pecking rice.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ji Anguo only had one daughter Ji Yao\u2014Lou Yu\u2019s mother. So after Ji Yao died, Ji Anguo put all his heart on Lou Yu.Since Mo Fei became Lou Yu\u2019s wife now, Ji Anguo would definitely get him investigated.The stuff Ji Anguo dug out was a little more than the gossip on the Star website. Like, although Mo Fei got rejected 17 times. But except the first time, all the other 16 times were that Mo Fei didn\u2019t like the other party and tried to reject it. Mo Fei really could come up with all kinds of strange tricks, very impressive.Ji Fei went a little stiff under Ji Anguo\u2019s staring.Ji Anguo then smiled, \u201chaving been married with Lou Yu for some days, why didn\u2019t you come to visit me?\u201dMo Fei said awkwardly, \u201cI heard you were having a rest-cure. So I didn\u2019t go disturb you.\u201dJi Anguo nodded, \u201cI got it. I heard you went to the Imperial College. Are you used to it?\u201dMo fei said awkwardly, \u201ckind of.\u201d It would be much better if those teachers didn\u2019t make trouble for him.\u201cA few days ago I saw an article you wrote for my grandson. Very vivid!\u201d praised Ji Anguo.Mo Fei then forced a smile, \u201cno, no, you overpraise me. Actually it\u2019s not that good.\u201dJi Anguo smiled, \u201cdon\u2019t be too modest. Few people could describe my grandson so precisely. I even gave it a like.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d So among the few hundreds of likes, even General Ji\u2019s also made a contribution.Ji Anguo then glanced at Mo Yi, with kind of complicated expression.Mo Yi then looked at Ji Anguo on guard. Ji Anguo then smiled, \u201cNo need to guard against me. I am not a monster.\u201dMo Yi still didn\u2019t let his guard down a bit, face turning all red. Ji Anguo\u2019s level 8 power hung them over, but Mo Fei couldn\u2019t feel it at all, while Mo Yi felt like being pressed by a mountain, all his bones were like being grounded into powder.\u201cMo Fei, your servant isn\u2019t bad!\u201d said Ji Anguo smilingly.\u201cMo Yi? He is a master.\u201d said Mo Fei proudly.Mo Yi had a spur to throw a kick at Mo Fei. After Mo Fei finished his words, Mo Yi felt more stressed.Noticing Mo Yi sweating profusely, Mo Fei finally realized something ain\u2019t no right.\u201cGrandpa! Mo Yi is still young!\u201d Mo Fei raised his voice.Then Ji Anguo stopped stressing them, and Mo Yi looked at Ji Anguo indifferently, like a hunting leopard.\u201cNot bad, not bad, really.\u201d said Ji Anguo while looking at Mo Yi.Mo Yi answered modestly, \u201cyou overpraise me, general.\u201d\u201cGrandpa!\u201d Lou Yu came out at this time.On seeing Lou Yu, Mo Fei couldn\u2019t help backing up a few steps, in case Lou Yu might surprise attack him.And when Lou Yu saw Mo Fei, he immediately flew into anger. This guy slandered that he had bed-wetting. Damn it!Lou Yu then strode towards Mo Fei, while Mo Fei shouted nervously, \u201cHelp! A satyr! Help!\u201dJi Anguo was dumbfounded and then laughed out loud.\u201cShut up! You are my wife. Even if I take advantage of you, so what?\u201d Lou Yu grabbed Mo Fei\u2019s collar and dragged him away.Mo Fei thought for a bit and said, \u201cI would be very glad if you take advantage of me. But under such broad daylight, it\u2019s really inappropriate.\u201dLou Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dJi Anguo then said with a smile, \u201call right, all right. You\u2019re a couple. Is there anything you can not talk through?\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cyes, yes! We can talk. Let go of me first!\u201dLou Yu glared at Mo Fei and then released him.Mo Fei then backed up a few steps while looking at Lou Yu on guard, and then Mo Yi moved forward and stood before Mo Fei.Ji Anguo waved his hand, saying, \u201call right. Save your private talk in your bedroom.\u201dLou Yu nodded and then brought Mo Fei away.\u201cGeneral, why were you so harsh to Mo Yi?\u201d asked Su Qi, \u201cpeople would say you bully the weak.\u201dJi Anguo smiled, \u201cI was just trying Mo Yi\u2019s power. I heard your grandson got beaten up for a few times by Mo Yi. I was helping your grandson to vent his anger!\u201dSu Qi, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNever expected Mo Fei is this kind of person, totally different from what the Star website said.\u201d said Su Qi.Ji Anguo nodded, \u201cYeah! I also feel a little surprised.\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: DisputeWatching Mo Fei\u2019s figure face away, Su Qi asked, \u201cgeneral, what do you think of the third Crown Princess?\u201d\u201cAs long as he has nothing to do with the person in the palace, he is more suitable to Lou Yu than Lin Feiyu.\u201d said Ji Anguo coldly.Su Qi nodded. Lin Feiyu had superb cultivation gift, potion-refining gift and he was also proficient in music and drawing. Everything of him is perfect!But it\u2019s shame that he is Prince Feng\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, totally standing on the opposite side of Prince Yu. So the more outstanding Lin Feiyu is, the more threatening he is to Prince Yu.\u201cLin Feiyu is really annoying. Since he chooses Prince Feng, he should avoid Prince Yu. What is it now being involved with Prince Yu again?\u201d said Su Qi grumpily.\u201cYeah! He really lacks a sense of propriety. He wants ten formations without even paying? What does he take my grandson as? A sucker?\u201d said Ji Anguo coldly.Ji Anguo was pretty satisfied with Lin Feiyu before. He had always thought Lin Feiyu would be together with Lou Yu, but Lin Feiyu finally chose Lou Feng. So when Lin Feiyu became Lou Feng\u2019s Crown Princess, Lou Yu became a laughingstock of the public!Su Qi also felt resentful. The cultivating formations were in such high demand and so many pairs of eyes were staring, while Lin Feiyu planned to reap without sowing.If it hadn\u2019t been the third Crown Princess, maybe Lin Feiyu had already taken the formations away. As for Lin Feiyu and Prince Feng\u2019s relationship, the cultivating formations would quite possibly fall into his hands.Their Su family was so close to Prince Yu and only got four cultivating formations, plus the two swindling from Su Rong, just enough to build one cultivating room. A cultivating room constituted with six formations could accommodate over 100 people. So to grab a place for the cultivation room, everyone in Su family was cracking their brains.Su Qi then showed up a slice of smile, \u201cgeneral, well, this is the first time we see Lin Feiyu get cold-shoulder treatment from Prince Yu this time. The Crown Princess is really something.\u201dJi Anguo smiled coldly, \u201crelying on Lou Yu\u2019s affection of him, Lin Feiyu takes my grandson as a fool, which is really unbearable.\u201dIf Lou Yu really gave Lin Feiyu the cultivating formations, that is to take their own things to help their rival in love, enemies. Ji Anguo felt aggrieved for Lou Yu even on thinking of it.\u201cThe Crown Princess isn\u2019t a pushover!\u201d said Su Qi. Both he and Ji Anguo saw it clearly what had happened at Lou Yu\u2019s place.\u201cBeing shrewish isn\u2019t something bad. Otherwise he couldn\u2019t subdue my silly grandson.\u201d Ji Anguo sighed.Lou Yu pushed Mo Fei into the bedroom, and Mo Fei looked at Lou Yu hostile, \u201chey, what do you want?\u201dMo Fei crossed his hands before his chest, \u201cbehave yourself! We have an agreement. Don\u2019t covet on each other\u2019s beauty.\u201dLou Yu sneered, \u201cBeauty? Do you have that kind of stuff?\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d Asshole! I am pretty handsome, OK?Lou Yu looked at Mo Fei unfriendly, \u201cyou sold the two formations to your two classmates?\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cWho allowed you?\u201d said Lou Yu bitterly.Mo Fei\u2019s face darkened, \u201cyou didn\u2019t say I can\u2019t sell them? Besides, I only sold two. I wouldn\u2019t steal your business.\u201dLou Yu said bitterly, \u201cyou can sell none!\u201dMo Fei also showed his teeth, \u201cno? Why? Do you how much they paid? 150 million! They are way much more generous than you the niggard! Considering your feelings, I only promised two of them. You could give ten for free to your lover while I can\u2019t sell none? You may steal a horse, while I may not look over the hedge?\u201d\u201cI never promised to give out the ten formations.\u201d said Lou Yu.Mo Fei sneered, \u201cthat\u2019s because I played the cop today and saved you a lot of money. Otherwise, once your lover opened his mouth, for your soft bones, you\u2019ve already agreed. Instead of treating me a big meal to show your gratitude, now you are picking my nose? What do you mean?\u201dLou Yu\u2019s face darkened, and he said, \u201cthe past is the past. Don\u2019t sell any for now on.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cOK. But you also can\u2019t sell the formations to your sister-in-law at a low price.\u201d Mo Fei stressed the word sister-in-law.Lou Yu then smiled, \u201care you being jealous?\u201dMo Fei smiled, and then sized Lou Yu up, saying with a despising tone, \u201cif you are a hot chick, I might be jealous.\u201dLou Yu snorted, \u201csomeone like you wants a hot chick? Maybe next life.\u201dMo Fei got burned up, \u201cin my next life, even if I\u2019m going to stay single for my whole life, I wouldn\u2019t marry someone like you.\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Was he here to send you the cultivating formations?\u201d asked Lou Jing eagerly.Lou Feng shook his head, \u201cFeiyu said he went to ask for the formations from Lou Yu but got rejected because of Mo Fei!\u201dLou Jing frowned, saying grumpily, \u201cMo Fei? You mean that bumpkin our Mother Consort has betrothed to Lou Yu?\u201dLou Feng nodded, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s him. Feiyu said Lou Yu has already agreed. But this Mo Fei didn\u2019t agree, so Lou Yu made an excuse and took back his words.\u201dLou Jing frowned, \u201cOh no! That Mo Fei is just a guy from a no-one-has-ever-heard-of place who got rejected like a hundred times. Why would Lou Yu listen to him?\u201d\u201cIt looks we have belittled this Mo Fei. There are a lot of rumors about this Mo Fei on the Star website. Someone said he had premarital pregnancy, someone said he has got tuberculosis and won\u2019t live long, someone even said he has serious hircismus that could kill people, and a lot of people said he is intolerable to the eyes\u2026But, in fact, Mo Fei is kind of cute who plays the piano well and even gets the better of Lin Feiyu.\u201d said Lou Feng.Lou Jing knitted his brows and said, \u201cIs it possible those rumors were made up by those who are jealous of him marrying Lou Yu?\u201dLou Feng shook his head, \u201cThose rumors were already there before he married Lou Yu. Our Mother Consort immediately nailed the marriage between Mo Fei and Lou Yu only because he saw those rumors only to disgust Lou Yu.\u201d\u201cBut where did those rumors come from?\u201d asked Lou Jing.\u201cMo Fei made them up himself.\u201d said Lou Feng, face darkened.\u201cHimself? Why would he make up so many rumors to slander himself?\u201d asked Lou Jing with all question marks on her face.Lou Feng took a deep breath, \u201cTo be rejected. Mo Fei is not favored in his family, but he has a pretty face, so the madam of Mo family plans to marry him to some big family for social connections. The madam of Mo family is not Mo Fei\u2019s biological mother, so the dates she set for Mo Fei were all not so good. So Mo Fei tried all means to defame himself in order not to marry any of them.\u201dLou Jing\u2019s face also darkened, \u201cIt looks this Mo Fei is really something.\u201dLou Feng nodded, \u201cYeah! Never expected after a careful selection, our Mother Consort would pick such a tough one.\u201dLou Jing then said sullenly, \u201cHow even capable he is, he is just a clodhopper from the countryside. What does he know? Having offended Feiyu, he even wouldn\u2019t know how he is gonna die.\u201dLou Feng nodded, \u201cYou are right! Maybe Lou Yu turned Feiyu down not because of Mo Fei. He just took him as an excuse.\u201dLou Jing then said with her brows knitted, \u201cIf so, it might not be true that those people out there all said Lou Yu\u2019s love for Lin Feiyu is as deep as the sea.\u201dLou Feng clenched his fists, \u201cBut Lou Yu had been seriously sick for a whole month after being dumped by Feiyu that year.\u201dLou Jing smiled regrettably, \u201cYou know, men are all disobliging thing! With new love, they will certainly forget about the ex. In the future Lin Feiyu\u2019s influence on Lou Yu would become weaker and weaker.\u201dIt hadn\u2019t been that Lou Yu was too heartbroken for Lin Feiyu, those people they sent to assasult Lou Yu couldn\u2019t have succeeded so easily. Although Lou Yu successfully promoted to a higher grade, his aptitude had greatly decreased.At this time Na Lanyue walked in, saying to Lou Feng and Lou Jing, \u201cFeng, do you have any cultivation formation at hands?\u201dLou Feng shook his head, \u201cLou Yu turned me down. Then Feiyu also failed.\u201dNa Lanyue\u2019s face darkened, \u201cDamn it! I heard the Ji Family has built ten cultivation rooms, with each one adopting six cultivating formations enough for 100 men to cultivate. Now those soldiers of Ji Family are all in high spirits. Instead of supporting the imperial family, he used them on his own soldiers. Is it plotting to rebel after those low life soldiers are full-winged?\u201dLou Feng frowned, \u201cI totally agree. Lou Yu has gone too far this time.\u201d\u201cMother, I heard the researchers you scooped from Lejie Lab still haven\u2019t worked anything out.\u201d said Lou Jing with kind of expectations.Na Lanyue let out a sigh, \u201cMaybe those I enrolled are peripheral. They know little about the inside information.\u201dLou Yu also heaved a sigh and said, \u201cReally?\u201dNa Lanyue gritted her teeth, \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t expect is the cultivating formation would cause such a stir. Lou Yu is going to earn some good money this time!\u201dLou Jing nodded and said enviously, \u201cYeah. Mother, a friend of mine entrusted me to buy one. He said he would like to pay 300 or even 400 million as long as I can get him one. Lou Yu makes such a high price. He is definitely going to be rich.\u201dOver 100 billion! Na Lanyue frowned. She planned to drag down the Ji Family using the military expenditure. With this huge sum of income, they can have a total equipment upgrading and their power would come up to a new level!If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lin Feiyu who always came to class early still hadn\u2019t come.\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Lin Feiyu come yet? Is it because he was given cold-shoulder from Prince Yu and feels ashamed to come?\u201d teased a voluptuous girl.Everyone in the Elite Class has solid background. This girl was no exception. She was the daughter of the first wife of a big consortium.Xu Zihan cast a glance at her and said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense! Feiyu and Prince Yu were childhood lovers. Prince Yu would never say no as long as it is Feiyu.\u201d\u201cIf I recall it correctly, he has engaged to Prince Feng! But now he is still seeing Prince Yu. Aren\u2019t he afraid Prince Feng may get mad?\u201d Another girl said.Most girls from those big families were spoiled. Of course they wouldn\u2019t feel good having been under the shadow of Lin Feiyu for a long time.\u201cIsn\u2019t the thing he likes doing most acting as a two-timer relying on his pretty face? Prince Yu has been married. He still doesn\u2019t avoid arousing suspicion.\u201d tittered a girl covering her mouth.\u201cBut things have changed now. Now Prince Yu has his wife. It may not be that easy if he still gives whatever Lin Feiyu asks for.\u201d said another girl.\u201cYou mean that bumpkin? said Xu Zihan disdainfully.The girl nodded, \u201cYeah, that bumpkin! Although he has no background, he is Prince Yu\u2019s wife now. What is Lin Feyu? Oh, sorry. He is Prince Yu\u2019s sister-in-law. Sister-in-law!\u201d\u201cRuying, have you got some stable push?\u201d asked a girl seeing Ruying\u2019s confident expression.Ruying only responded with a smilence.When Lin Feiyu came in, those girls who were gossiping about him immediately shut their mouths up.On seeing Xu Zihan, Xu Zihan said cock-a-hoop, \u201cFeiyu, Prince Yu must have given you the cultivating formations, hasn\u2019t he? Those with no eyes said you can\u2019t convince Prince Yu.\u201dLin Feiyu\u2019s face immediately turned red. Xu Zihan\u2019s words were like needles piercing into his heart. Lin Feiyu gritted his teeth. Xu Zihan is his enemy from now on!Judging from Lin Feiyu\u2019s expression, Xu Zihan realized things were not that simple.One girl tittered on seeing Lin Feiyu\u2019s twisted face.She then said with disdain, \u201cIt seems our beauty Lin had a wild goose chase! But, we can totally understand. Men are all forgetful. He has been newly married and is intimate with his wife. How could he care about anyone else?\u201dLin Fei scanned those classmates coldly, wearing a long face.When Mo Fei walked into the classroom, he noticed that the way everyone looked at him was kind of odd.Yan Chen wore a complacent smile while Xu Zihan looked at him with all hatred beaming in his eyes.When Mo Fei sat down, Yan Chen still looked at him adoringly.[What is wrong with everyone?] Mo Fei dare not say anything. He could only send Yan Chen a message.Yan Chen immediately got excited and replied, [Xu Zihan asked Lin Feiyu about the cultivating formation thing just now. Lin Fei explained Prince Yu turned him down all because of you. Now Xu Zihan should already hate you to the bones.][Hum! Who does he think he is? He has already engaged with Prince Feng and still went to ask a favor from Prince Yu for free? Doesn\u2019t he know Prince Feng and Prince Yu don\u2019t get along?] typed Yan Chen furiously.Mo Fei shrugged his shoulders and deleted their message record.Yan Chen also deleted it then. Lin Feiyu was extremely petty. If he found it, they\u2019d be dropping dead.At this time, Lin Feiyu turned around and glared at Mo Fei with that pair of cold and gloomy eyes.Mo Fei felt that the temperature dropped a few degrees immediately when Lin Feiyu threw his eyes at him. So cool!Xu Zihan looked at Mo Fei fiercely like he was gonna swallow him alive.Mo Fei rubbed his nose, \u201cI don\u2019t remember I offended surname Xu! Why does he look at me like that?\u201dYan Chen said, \u201cMo Fei, you should be careful. Xu Zihan\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is really something. His fianc\u00e9 is coming to visit him from the army headquarters. You\u2019ll be dead if he tells his fianc\u00e9 about you.\u201d\u201cIs his fianc\u00e9 really that powerful?\u201d asked Mo Fei.Yan Chen nodded, saying with a serious tone, \u201cOf course.\u201dMo Fei rolled his eyes and rubbed his chin while thinking, \u201cIf he is really so powerful, then I should take precautions.\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When one was in bad luck, he even got water stuck between the teeth! Mo Fei then looked at the old man with white beard sadly.\u201cMo Fei, are you speaking ill of me?\u201d sneered the white beard old man.Mo Fei then said awkwardly, \u201cNo, teacher, this is a mistake.

History tells us there\u2019s oppressing everywhere.\u201d The old man then laughed sharply, making Mo Fei\u2019s blood frozen.Mo Fei frowned, thinking, \u201cShouldn\u2019t there be the latter half of \u2018there\u2019s oppressing everywhere\u2019?\u201dLike he had guessed what Mo Fei was thinking, the old man with white beard said exaltedly, \u201cYes, yes, yes. You all know where there is oppressing, there\u2019s revolting.\u201dThen he snorted, \u201cRevolting? Do you think you can? If you dare revolt me, I will never let you pass and you can only retake it!\u201dMo Fei lowered his head, thinking, \u201cThis old man is vicious!\u201d\u201cMo Fei, let me ask you. How was Yan Kingdom annihilated in the year 3422 in Star history?\u201dMo Fei\u2019s eyes shone. He knew the answer, \u201cIn the year 3417 in Star history, two brothers Yan Xinglie and Yan Xingde overturned the former dynasty and set up Yan Kingdom. But meanwhile the two brothers fell in love with the former king\u2019s consort Wen Xue\u2019er. So the brothers stifled openly and secretly for years, only making the masses suffer. Finally Yan Kingdom got overturned by Wang Xing and Wen Xue\u2019er finally became Wang Xing\u2019s favored consort.\u201d\u201cThen how did the level 8 master Wang Mingyang die in the year 3512 in Star history?\u201d\u201cWang Mingyang had a childhood fianc\u00e9e called Wang Qinghe. His fianc\u00e9e got a heavy disease. And the doctor told him only his heart could save his fianc\u00e9e. So he dug out his heart and died.\u201d This idiot! That doctor was disguised by his love rival. After he died, his rival in love married Wang Qinghe. One could be silly sometimes, but not too silly all the time. Otherwise, that would be his fatal weakness.\u201cBetween 3572 and 3574 in Star history, Meng Kingdom has changed three kings in three years\u2019 time. What happened?\u201d\u201cThe Madam of the king Meng Ran Li Qian\u2019er was a pin-up who won Meng Fan\u2019s fondness. One time Li Qian\u2019er saw Meng Ran\u2019s handsome younger brother Meng Hao and had a crush, so she poisoned Meng Ran and enthroned Meng Hao. But it turned out Meng Hao was had sexual dysfuntion and couldn\u2019t satisfy Li Qian\u2019er. So Li Qian\u2019er poisoned Meng Hao to death and then enthroned Meng Xing. And then she became Meng Xing\u2019s consort.\u201d Lian Qian\u2019er really didn\u2019t come to this world in vain!The old man with white beard then smiled, \u201cGood, good. They are all right. Good job!\u201dYan Chen looked at Mo Fei with star eyes, making Mo Fei a little shy, saying, \u201cMy answers are not so overall.\u201dThe old man with white bear snorted, \u201cAnything about beauties, you would know every detail, while it\u2019s something having nothing to do with beauties, your answers are a total mess. What do you want?\u201dMo Fei thought to himself, \u201cThis old man\u2019s brain still works! He totally sees me through.\u201dThen the old man sneered unkindly, \u201cSince you are so interested in women, you will be reincarnated as a woman in afterlife. But even if you are reincarnated as a woman, it\u2019s impossible that you want to enjoy a joyful bed life like other beauties.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d This old man! He wouldn\u2019t mind if he didn\u2019t bless him to be surrounded by hot chicks in her next life. But how could he curse him to be reincarnated as a woman!

    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: One Has to Lower the Head when under the Eaves (1)After scolding Mo Fei from his head to his toes, the white beard old man finally showed mercy and let Mo Fei sit.It made Mo Fei\u2019s head dizzy, thinking, \u201cThis old man cursed me to reincarnate as a woman in the afterlife? Seen from his shrewish posture, maybe he himself was a woman in his previous life!\u201dPeople say it is more dreadful to piss of a woman who doesn\u2019t look like a woman than a woman who looks like a woman! But few people know that it even more scary to piss off a man who doesn\u2019t look like a man than a man who looks like a man!In this world, awful people are everywhere. Life is so hard!Yan Chen caught a glimpse of Mo Fei with all sympathy while Mo Fei held his forehead, having a headache. He thought, \u201cI should really good good study, day day up! Otherwise I would end up horribly.\u201dLooking at the depressed Mo Fei, the old man started to have his Star History class with satisfaction.\u201cIn history, there was a very famous level 7 handsome master called Wang Ruo\u2019an who had numerous admirers. He got a long line of women chasing after him. But however handsome he is, he can\u2019t compare with me. When I was young, no one didn\u2019t like me, even including the flowers. Countless beautiful women even couldn\u2019t move their legs when seeing me. And countless beautiful women would wait for me in bed\u2026\u201d The history class old man patted the table and said high-spirited.Looking at this white beard old man wearing that dirty, oily robe, Mo Fei really couldn\u2019t believe a word of him.\u201cThe king of Wen Kingdom Su Anlun was a love fool. After his wife cheated on him, he got depressed and eventually died of it. His death is a joke. He died for a woman. But I am different. Only women would die for me in line, while I would never die for any of them\u2026\u201dMo Fei blinked and thought to himself, \u201cIf any woman would die for this old man, that could only be because she is grossed to death by him.\u201d\u201cDo you know why Wu Kingdom perished? That\u2019s because their king had early love. He had his first concubine at the age of 10. Having such a lustful king, give me a reason his kingdom didn\u2019t perish! When I was ten, I was still single.\u201dMo Fei nodded, thinking, \u201cThis old man was single when he was ten. Now he is still single. With such a twisted personality, it\u2019s only because he has been single for too long.\u201d\u2026Mo Fei looked at this old man, confused. Teaching his class this way, it\u2019s really a miracle that he could survive in the Imperial College which was famous for its strict style of study!When the bell rang, the old man dismissed the class contentedly.Mo Fei also exhaled a long breath of relief. Before Mo Fei was done with it, the old man called him again, \u201cMo Fei, copy the sentence \u201cI am a super idiot\u201d 1,000 times after class.\u201dMo Fei popped his eyes out and asked, \u201cBut why? It\u2019s unreasonable!\u201d I am such a brilliant genius! How could I write \u201cI am a super idiot\u201d?The old man then smiled arrogantly, \u201cUnreasonable? Are you trying to reason with me? Let me tell you. I am the reason!\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dThen the old man walked away with his head held high pompously.After walking out of the door, the old man\u2019s lips curled up. Hum! He had struggled so long and finally decided to use all his savings for that goddamn cultivating formation, Prince Yu the asshole detained his application and turned him down!Since Prince Yu who was wet behind the ears face slapped him, his wife deserved to be tortured!On the other side, Mo Fei\u2019s face darkened with great anger.Looking at Mo Fei\u2019s face as dark as the blackboard, Yan Chen forced a smile, \u201cMo Fei, don\u2019t be mad. Our history teacher is always like that.\u201d\u201cHow could such a person be a model for the students in the Imperial College?\u201d exclaimed Mo Fei.Yan Chen then whispered, \u201cThe headmaster wishes that he could dismiss that old man. Pity that our headmaster is not his rival.\u201dMo Fei was surprised, \u201cIsn\u2019t the headmaster a level 7 master? Still not that old scoundrel\u2019s match?\u201dYan Chen looked around. After making sure the old man had really left, he then said, \u201cDon\u2019t belittle him. That old man is also a level 7 master!\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026A level 7 master teaches us history?\u201d Isn\u2019t it too underemployed? In Rong Kingdom, a level 7 master could be rendered as the top master!\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So he chose to be a history teacher to find faults with his students, so as to walk out of the shadow.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d Fuck! What theory is that?!\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he go back on his own history teacher instead of tormenting us students?!\u201d said Mo Fei grumpily.\u201cHe wished that he could get even with his history teacher. Pity that when he went to his history teacher, his history teacher had already passed away.\u201d said Yan Chen helplessly.Mo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dXu Zihan looked at Mo Fei, with a wisp of cold smile at the corner of his mouth.\u201cThose who could teach in the Imperial College are all talents, but sometimes, you know, they\u2019d pass fish eyes for pearls. But anyway the history teacher really has a pair of sharp eyes. With only once glance and he could tell you are an idiot.\u201d sneered Xu Zihan.Mo Fei then smiled, \u201cI heard those who could be enrolled into the Imperial College are all talents, and I was under a lot of pressure. But when I see you, suddenly I have a feeling that the Imperial College is just so so. And I felt much relieved.\u201dXu Zihan looked at Mo Fei, face darkened immediately, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dMo Fei then sneered, \u201cAre my words really that hard to comprehend? If you can\u2019t even understand such simple words, then you are really\u2026an idiot!\u201d\u201cMo Fei, you wanna pick a fight?\u201d said Xu Zihan ferociously.Mo Fei then said casually, \u201cCome on! Come on! Do you think I\u2019m afraid of you?\u201dYan Chen pulled Mo Fei and said, \u201cMo Fei, stop making a scene!\u201dMo Fei then said innocently, \u201cIt\u2019s not me. Someone bullies me since he has got a powerful lover.\u201dXu Zihan looked at Mo Fei with a sullen face, \u201cMo Fei, Prince Yu will divorce you the dumbass sooner or later!\u201dMo Fei then said drowsily, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry. Even if he divorces me, you are the last person he is gonna marry! So, whether he divorces me or not really has nothing to do with you.\u201dXu Zihan, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cMo Fei, we are all classmates. Do you really need to be so pushy?\u201d Lin Feiyu got up and said.Mo Fei looked at Lin Feiyu, then smiled shyly, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry! Mr. Lin, I can\u2019t take bullies from others. Whoever bites a finger of mine, I will bit off an arm of his. I\u2019m not that kind as you. I feel really ashamed.\u201d\u201cSometimes suffering losses is a blessing.\u201d said Lin Feiyu while looking at Mo Fei.Mo Fei smiled, \u201cMr. Lin, you really have high morals. How I wish that I am that good!\u201dLin Feiyu looked at Mo Fei, with a slice of malevolence flashing in his eyes.Yan Chen pulled Mo Fei\u2019s sleeve and mediated, \u201cAll right, all right. Mo Fei, let\u2019s go to the library. Didn\u2019t you say you want to study hard and get a good score?\u201dMo Fei nodded and then said, \u201cYes, yes, let\u2019s go then.\u201d Wasting time on someone who isn\u2019t worth it is really a wrong choice. He Mo Fei\u2019s time is very precious!Most of the plants of the Daybreak Star were different from the world he came from. Although most star herbs looked much alike from those from his world, but their properties were totally different.Due to the restrictions, the materials of a lot of star herbs were out of the reach of someone of his level. And now he finally got an opportunity, he would definitely seize it and make full use of it.Mo Fei and Yan Chen walked to the library shoulder by shoulder. Yan Chen looked at Mo Fei and said with a very serious tone, \u201cMo Fei, as for the homework the history asked you to do, you can\u2019t forget it!\u201dMo Fei frowned and asked out of curiosity, \u201cChenchen, what if I don\u2019t write it?\u201dThe expression on Yan Chen\u2019s face changed a bit, he then said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. What I know is last time when someone offended the history teacher, the history also asked him to write \u2018I am an idiot\u2019 a thousand times, but he didn\u2019t write it. The history teacher then hung him on the flagpole and stuck papers written \u2018I am an idiot\u2019 all around his body.\u201dMo Fei: Oh my god! Someone like the history teacher should really be put into the pig cage and thrown into water!\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the headmaster throw him out?\u201d asked Mo Fei bitterly.Yan Chen looked around and then said, \u201cOnce the headmaster gathered a lot of teachers together trying to drive him out. The result is he sent all that bunch of teachers into the clinic. I heard even the headmaster got beaten up and fled away\u2026\u201dMo Fei: I\u2019m so down on my luck this year! Why would he pin his eyes on me?!Yan Chen looked at Mo Fei pitifully, \u201cMo Fei, don\u2019t you ever do silly things!\u201dMo Fei nodded and said seriously, \u201cI know.

    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: A FavorTranslator: Guy Gone BadMo Fei bent over the desk, writing his homework impatiently.Mo Yi watched Mo Fei\u2019s twisted face and said, \u201cYoung master, be gentle. You are gonna puncture the paper.\u201dMo Fei\u2019s expression changed a bit, he then said, \u201cThat old son of a bitch! He will get his karma!\u201dMo Yi nodded and echoed, \u201cYes, yes. He will definitely get his karma. That old bastard will stay fucking single for all his life.\u201dMo Fei scratched his head painfully, \u201cYiyi, how many times have I written?\u201dMo Yi looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cOver 200 times.\u201d\u201cWhat?! I\u2019ve been writing for so long and it\u2019s only over 200 times?\u201d said Mo Fei testily.Mo Yi said, \u201cYoung master, it\u2019s true that you have been writing for a long time. But you didn\u2019t only write \u2018I am an idiot\u2019. You also wrote \u2018that darn old asshole\u2019, and you wrote it over 300 times already.\u201dMo Fei scratched his head bitterly, \u201cThat old scoundrel! To ask me such a smart genius to write \u201cI am an idiot\u2019, isn\u2019t it absurd?\u201dMo Yi, \u201c\u2026Young master, forget about whether it\u2019s absurd or not. You better go on writing.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cFine! You go to sleep. I can manage it myself.\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cAll right. Then I\u2019m going to sleep now.\u201dMo Fei sat by the window, looking at the dark sky outside, feeling a bit sad and lonely.\u201cWhat are you writing?\u201d an elegant and gorgeous voice sounded by his ear suddenly.With warm breaths blowing into Mo Fei\u2019s ears, Mo Fei immediately jumped up like a cat being stamped on its tail.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d questioned Mo Fei in anger.Lou Yu then smiled, \u201cThis is my house. Is it strange that I appear here?\u201dMo Fei then glared at Lou Yu sullenly, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you even make a sound when you came in?\u201dLou Yu smiled, \u201cSeeing you writing so intently, I didn\u2019t have the heart to disturb you. What were you writing?\u201dMo Fei quickly covered the papers, \u201cNone of your business.\u201dLou Yu smiled and then said amiably, \u201cHow is it none of my business? You are my wife. Your everything is related to me.\u201dLou Yu then pulled the exercise book from under Mo Fei\u2019s arms. Then Lou Yu immediately put on a bright smile, \u201c \u2018I am an idiot\u2019?! Mo Fei, I have never known you are so self-aware. You even know yourself an idiot!\u201dMo Fei\u2019s face reddened immediately, \u201cDoes it have anything to do with you?\u201dLou Yu found it really funny on seeing Mo Fei\u2019s red face.Mo Fei then said impatiently, \u201cGet out!\u201dLou Yu held his arms, looked at Mo Fei seriously, \u201cWhat happened? Tell me.\u201dMo Fei then said reluctantly, \u201cI offended the star history teacher. So he punished me to write it a thousand times.\u201d\u201cStar history teacher? What is his name?\u201d asked Lou Yu.Mo Fei scratched his head, \u201cJust our star history teacher. How would I know his name?\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei and snorted, \u201cYou even don\u2019t know your teacher\u2019s name? A thousand times may not be enough.\u201dMo Fei then glared at Lou Yu, \u201cWhat do you know? I\u2019ve got a lot of things to memorize. How would I have time for such unimportant things?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of person is your teacher?\u201d asked Lou Yu.After thinking for a bit, Mo Fei said, \u201cHe is narcissistic. He always said when he was young, many beautiful girls were addicted to his charm. Some beautiful girls and cute guys fought for him. I highly doubt he has got paranoea.\u201dLou Yu\u2019s eyebrows were furrowed, \u201cIs your teacher surnamed E?\u201dMo Fei thought a bit and said, \u201cSurname E it is. I heard someone call him Teacher E.\u201dLou Yu then said, \u201cYou don\u2019t even know his name? His name is very special.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d asked Mo Fei.Lou Yu nodded, \u201cYeah, he is called E Zuishuai (literally means \u2018I am the most handsome\u2019 in English). So you better call him Teacher Shuai (Shuai literally means handsome in English).\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d Teacher Shuai=that old crazy bastard?!Lou Yu picked up the pen and wrote a few words lightly.Mo Fei looked at his exercise book. He couldn\u2019t tell which words were written by Lou Yu unexpectedly!Mo Fei then said surprisingly, \u201cYou can imitate my handwriting?\u201dLou Yu nodded, \u201cI got very strong imitation ability. Feiyu didn\u2019t like writing homework when he was little, so I learnt imitating his handwriting and helped him write his homework.\u201dMo Fei said jealously, \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d said Lou Yu, as if he was still cherishing those old times.\u201cWhat a shame! He dumped you. So you writing homework for him goes to nothing.\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei, \u201cHow many times have you left? I can lend you a hand.\u201d\u201cOh???\u201d said Mo Fei while looking at Lou Yu with astonishment.Lou Yu looked his astonished face and said, \u201cTake it as I never said it.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, yes.

What do you mean?\u201d Lou Yu looked at her.\u201cThat is to say, when you write \u201cI am an idiot\u201d, then you find yourself really is.\u201d Mo Fei\u2019s sparkling eyes looked at Lou Yu.Lou Yu squinted at Mo Fei and said earnestly, \u201cNo! Not at all.\u201d\u201cHm? Our teacher said, as you write more, you will have deeper self-awareness. Therefore, you have to write attentively, only in this was can you have the sense of identification!\u201d Mo Fei looked quite sincere.Lou Yu threw down his pen and said, \u201cEnjoy yourself. Wish you can find your sense of identification.\u201dMo Fei was puzzled and looked at Lou Yu, \u201cHey, why did you quit? We\u2019re told never do things by halves.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sleepy, you may continue, remember, never do things by halves. If you don\u2019t write enough, your teacher will probably teach you a good lesson.\u201d Lou Yu grinned at Mo Fei cunningly.Mo Fei frowned. Well, this bastard is really unreliable.Mo Fei picked up the draft of Lou Yu to take a look at it. He showed face of disgust and said, \u201cHow ugly it is!\u201d\u201cIt was written according to your handwriting. Fish begins to rot from the head.\u201d Lou Yu was actually standing behind her.Hearing his voice, Mo Fei was startled, \u201cYou didn\u2019t leave!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go to sleep right away, after I come down for a cup of water.\u201d Lou Yu said grumpily.Looking at the back of Lou Yu, Mo Fei shouted loudly, \u201cSuch a heartless guy.\u201dLou Yu\u2019s mouth twitched. Heartless? He helped him with his homework with good intentions, but what he got was this guy\u2019s ramblings.Mo Fei walked into the classroom with deep dark circles under her eyes the next morning. Yan Chen gave him a compassionate look.\u201cMo Fei, your dark circles are very obvious. Did you write your homework late last night?\u201d Yan Chen asked with concern.Mo Fei nodded, \u201cYes! Very very late.\u201d\u201cSo, Prince Yu must have stayed alone in the room last night.\u201d Yan Chen said.Mo Fei nodded and said, \u201cYes! He was.\u201dFull of sympathy on her face, Yan Chen said, \u201cHow poor Prince Yu was! Slept alone the whole night.\u201dMo Fei was speechless. That guy? Why does he sympathize with him?! He occupies such an enormous bed.\u201cMo Fei, in fact, you don\u2019t need to finish it in a hurry. There is no history lesson today, just finish it the day after tomorrow.\u201d Yan Chen said.Mo Fei: \u201c\u2026\u201d What a hindsight! Why didn\u2019t he say it earlier?A handsome man dressed in a black windbreaker entered the classroom. Mo Fei could not help feeling blue as she looked at the handsome man. Damn, this guy dared to be more striking than her, which was abominable.\u201cWe have had a few days of body arts theory classes. Today we\u2019re going to have a partner exercise to test your learning achievements during this period.\u201d Chong Lou said coldly.Yan Chen blinked. He felt a little headache, \u201cI am done. Today\u2019s lesson is about fighting! I hate fighting the most.\u201dChong Lou\u2019s eyes swept over the students below, \u201cThe first place practices with the last, the second place and the next to last, and so forth.\u201dYan Chen shivered, \u201cSir, shouldn\u2019t the first place practice with the second, while the third and the fourth together? That would be better to give full play to everyone\u2019s strength.\u201dChong Lou gave Yan Chen a gloomy look and said, \u201cIf I do what you say, you guys who are dragging our feet will never know your gap with the best and will never know the importance of hard work. There is a saying \u2018People will get the courage to improve when they feel ashamed\u2019. Only when you are hurt would you realize you should make progress.\u201d\u201cThe first and last place in body arts, please come forward.\u201d Chong Lou said coldly.Hearing this, Lin Fei Yu stepped forward. Mo Fei was surprised and said, \u201cHuh? Lin Feiyu? Is he the first or the last place?\u201d\u201cHe is, of course, the first place. His physical attack skills rank the top and he is already a level three body arts master. One of the best in our grade, let alone our class.\u201d Yan Chen explained admiringly.Mo Fei stared at him in surprise. \u201cHey, this guy looks fragile, I didn\u2019t expect he is such a strong character.\u201dThis gigolo was not a nobody! Mo Fei thought in the heart secretly.\u201cMo Fei, what are you waiting for? Come up!\u201d Chong Lou was kind of impatient.Mo Fei was surprised and said, \u201cI am the last one?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you do not know! You are the worst performer in the class.

He could swear that he saw a strong sense of murder in Lin Feiyu\u2019s seemingly calm eyes.Her face darkened and he thought to himself: she wouldn\u2019t want to take this opportunity to kill me, would he?Mo Fei frowned, even if Lin Feiyu killed him, that idiot third prince might not put the blame on his old flame. If he had known that being a crown princess would be so dangerous, he would have tried to turn down the marriage no matter what.\u201cPlease go easy on me, Lin!\u201d Mo Fei said with some sort of shyness.Lin Feiyu smiled faintly, \u201cSure thing.\u201dLin Feiyu said he would show mercy, but it turned out he didn\u2019t have such intention judging from his fierce moves. Mo Fei dodged Lin Feiyu\u2019s intense attacks swiftly two times.Mo Fei frowned. It seemed that Lin Feiyu would not give up until he got beaten to half-dead! How could the third prince like such a ruthless person? That guy must have masochism.Lin Feiyu\u2019s face was gloomy. In his imagination, Mo Fei should be defeated in three moves of him, but he did not get what he wanted. Mo Fei was at a disadvantage, but he did not suffer many injuries.Mo Fei looked at Lin Feiyu with alert. Her fundamentals were really bad. Although he was about to make breakthrough and become a level 2 star magician after this period of conditioning and cultivation, still he did not make it. It was still hard for him to fight with Lin with his current strength.Mo Fei knew himself well. He would always run away when he found himself unable to defeat the enemy. So at this time, Mo Fei had made up his mind to quit.Lin Feiyu narrowed his eyes. Mo Fei\u2019s moves were more agile than he expected, however, but the level of his source force was too low, over time, it would run out and he would definitely take a fall.Chong Lou looked at Mo Fei with surprise. He was completely suppressed by Lin Feiyu, but her condition was still much better than he expected.Mo Fei took a glance at Lin Feiyu with a depressed look. The bastard even exerted dirty tricks on him, trying to leave him injured, and he was always attacking his face. This asshole must be jealous that I Mo Fei looks better than him, thought Mo Fei.\u201cI give up!\u201d Mo Fei said loudly.Chong Lou was kind of displeased, \u201cYou want to give up already only after a few moves? Can you have some backbone? You can throw in the towel, only after 30 minutes of you two fight.\u201dMo Fei\u2019s face darkened. Thirty minutes? Is the man also trying to murder me?Hearing what Chong Lou said, Lin Feiyu stepped forward and smashed his fist towards Mo Fei\u2019s face.Mo Fei covered his mouth and took several steps backwards. Damn, this bastard broke his mouth.Before Mo Fei resumed himself from the pain, Lin Feiyu\u2019s attack came again.Mo Fei tried his best to struggle with Lin Feiyu\u2019s attack.The thirty minutes was going to run out. But Lin Feiyu\u2019s offensive attacks became sharper, while Mo Fei had been beaten back and forth.Lin Feiyu looked at Mo Fei, his eyes emerging with murderous glitter.An invisible huge Qi suddenly hit Lin Feiyu\u2019s knee, interrupting his attacks. Mo Fei took the opportunity to escape and jumped off the platform.Lin Feiyu looked around nervously. Someone must have conspired against hhim. Who could dare to plot against him in front of the teacher?Chong Lou took a look at the direction of Mo Yi and a bright smile appeared on his lips. Things became more interesting!Lin Feiyu generated the motive to end Mo Fe\u2019s life. Just now he was ready to start his killing, but his plan was broke off. All the students in the Elite Class had powerful background, and it would very troublesome if anyone of them died.\u201cMo Fei, after this battle, I think you should know the gap between you and Lin, you are all crown princesses, but you should really learn from Lin!\u201d Chong Lou said meaningfully with folded arms.Mo Fei laid his hand on his bruised face and nodded, \u201cYes, sir. What you said is true.\u201dChong Lou glanced at Lin Feiyu and said earnestly, \u201cLin, even if you are outstanding and talented, you should bear this in mind that there is always someone who is better than you. Don\u2019t underestimate anyone!\u201dLin Feiyu nodded respectfully, \u201cThank you for your advice, teacher.\u201dChong Lou pretended to look in the direction of Mo Yi unintentionally. Mo Yi lowered his eyes and did not speak or look at Chong Lou.Chong Lou frowned. He thought that all those who could enter the Elite Class as an external students were cronies of the students in the class, so they would not be over 18 years old. Mo Yi\u2019s counterattack just now was really amazing. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that his strength much more superior to Mo Fei, he wouldn\u2019t have noticed Mo Yi\u2019s true potential.This third-level star magician under the age of 18 was simply gifted. He was truly outstanding in the lower grades of the Imperial College. It was really strange that such a person should be subordinated to such a master as ignorant as Mo Fei.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone in Elite Class was either super rich or super powerful. Both sides didn\u2019t expect something unpleasant to happen unless they had no alternative.Yan Chen\u2019s rival was a pretty girl. Their fight was like embroidering with a needle. You gave me a light punch and I gave you a faint kick, looking quite harmonious.Mo Fei\u2019s eyes twitched, thinking, \u201cWhat the hell! I\u2019ve fought so hard, while those guys are all deceiving the teacher. This is really not my day today!\u201dOnce it reached 30 minutes, Yan Chen immediately ran away like a deserter.Mo Fei looked at Yan Chen jealously. Why was he not so lucky like Yan Chen?Yan Chen was matched with an exquisite beauty.While he was randomized to a black bellied and cold-hearted toy boy!Every move of that beautiful girl was soft and gentle, so Yan Chen even didn\u2019t get a scratch.While that toy boy\u2019s was wicked and merciless. He got a bloody nose and a swollen face, and also a pain in the back.This is unfair! Unfair! What have I done wrong to deserve this!Yan Chen looked at Yan Chen, frowning, \u201cYanyan, that girl was so gentle to you. Do you have any protocol below the table?\u201dYan Chen said mysteriously, \u201cI planned to treat her a big meal to ask her to cut me loose, but she refused. She said she\u2019d consider letting me off only if I could get her a set of the Star Armor Skywater has newly released.\u201d\u201cSkywater Company? One of the top ten consortiums famous for its Star Armors?\u201d amazed Mo Fei.Yan Chen nodded, \u201cExactly!\u201d\u201cDo you even have connections of that company?\u201d asked Mo Fei amazingly.The Star Armors they produced had super strong resistance, but very pricey with limited number, which were hard to obtain even if you got money.Yan Chen nodded, \u201cYeah! Chenchen is the son of the chairman of Skywater Company. He will take over the whole company in the future. But now he only manages a few branches.\u201d\u201cChenchen? Your fianc\u00e9\u2026didn\u2019t you say your fianc\u00e9 sells clothes?\u201d Mo Fei looked at Yan Chen, confused.Yan Chen nodded, \u201cYeah! Star armors also belong to the category clothes, don\u2019t they?\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d How could Star Armors and clothes be mixed together?After the body arts class was over, Mo Yi supported the severely injured Mo Fei back to Prince Yu mansion.When Mo Fei arrived home, Lou Yu was coming downstairs and saw the messy Mo Fei.On seeing Lou Yu who was standing on the stairs, Mo Fei couldn\u2019t help grinding his teeth.\u201cWhat\u2019s happened? Why are you so ugly injured!\u201d said Lou Yu disgustedly while looking at Mo Fei\u2019s black and blue face.Mo Fei then cast a glance at Lou Yu sharply, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d\u201cYoung master, I\u2019ll go get your some medicine.\u201d said Mo Yi.Mo Fei nodded, \u201cHurry back.\u201dLou Yu raised his eyebrows, gloating, \u201cOh my! Oh my! What a good beat! Who did this to you? I already told you. Watch your mouth! You got such a bitchy mouth. It\u2019s unsurprising that you got beaten up. Did you lose any tooth? If you lose your teeth, there\u2019d be air leak when you call names.\u201d\u201cSorry to disappoint you. I am all good and in one whole piece! As for my injuries, it\u2019s all thanks to your sweetheart.\u201d said Mo Fei grumpily while looking at Mo Fei coldly.\u201cYou mean Feiyu?\u201d asked Lou Yu surprisingly.Mo Fei nodded, \u201cExactly!\u201dThe expression on Lou Yu\u2019s face became unpredictable, \u201cFeiyu is not that kind of person.\u201dMo Fei sneered and then pinched his voice, \u201cYeah! Lin Feiyu is so gentle and kind. He wouldn\u2019t show no mercy! My prince! I guess only after I married you did Mr. Lin realized that the one he really loves is you and the one who cares about him is still you! But what is done can\u2019t be undone. In order to wreak his anguish, he chose me as his punching bag. He planned to disfigure me, so you would get sick of me and remembers his pretty face, then get back to him!\u201dThe expression on Lou Yu\u2019s face became kind of odd now.Looking at Lou Yu\u2019s slightly reddened face, Mo Fei showed a touch of sneer, \u201cMy Prince, I was telling a cold joke. Is it funny?\u201dLou Yu got smoked, \u201cYou were telling a cold joke?!\u201dMo Fei grinned coldly, \u201cYeah! Isn\u2019t it funny? Do you really think Lin Feiyu would change his mind and throw himself back into your arms? He is your sister-in-law now. Stop daydreaming! Young man, daydream isn\u2019t something good. You may lose your soul if having it too much.\u201dLou Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d Mo Fei, you are so mean!\u201cYour cold joke isn\u2019t funny at all! If you don\u2019t know how to tell a cold joke, then keep your mouth shut!\u201d said Lou Yu fiercely.Mo Fei then said resentfully, \u201cWhat did you say? You asshole! I tried to tell you a cold joke while I\u2019m still so badly injured, instead of smiling or what to show some courtesy, you said such mean words. Where is your manner?\u201dHearing Mo Fei accusing, Lou Yu also got burned up, \u201cWho would laugh at such kind of lame joke?\u201dMo Fei snorted, \u201cWhat? A lot of people out there would laugh!\u201dLou Yu said disapprovingly, \u201cMaybe ghost would believe what you said.\u201dOn seeing Mo Yi come out carrying a bottle of solution, Mo Fei immediately said, \u201cMo Yi, I told a very funny cold joke, you know.\u201dMo Yi blinked and instantly understood, \u201cHahaha\u2026Young master, your cold joke is so, so funny. No one in the world is better than you on telling cold jokes!\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Yi, thinking: Anyway you are a talented cultivation talent. Is it really good to act as a lackey?Mo Fei then looked at Lou Yu proudly, \u201cSee? Even Yiyi is knows how to behave. Young man, you should learn more.

Let me apply some potion on those wounded places on your body.\u201d Mo Yi looked at Mo Fei.Mo Fei nodded and said without hesitation, \u201cOK!\u201dLou Yu\u2019s expression changed a bit. He then grabbed the potion from Mo Yi\u2019s hand and said to Mo Fei, \u201cLet me help you.\u201d\u201cMo Yi can do it for me.\u201d said Mo Fei disapprovingly.\u201cI said I\u2019ll do it. Stop nagging!\u201d said Lou Yu impatiently.Mo Fei blinked, looking a bit speechless, \u201cWell, since you insist, you do it! But remember to be gentle!\u201dLou Yu nodded, \u201cAll right. I know.\u201dAfter thinking for a second, Lou Yu gave Mo Fei a Princess hug and walked to the bedroom.Being held in Lou Yu\u2019s arms, Mo Fei\u2019s face immediately turned red.Mo Fei\u2019s red face then triggered Lou Yu\u2019s interest, \u201cWhat? Are you blushing? I thought your face is even thicker than body armor and things like blushing have nothing to do with you.\u201dMo Fei chuckled a little shyly and grumbled, \u201cMy prince, how could you say that? I have always been a thin-skinned person since I was little. People all said, \u2018Mo Fei, you should learn to be thick-skinned, otherwise, you\u2019d suffer in the future.\u2019\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei, saying blandly, \u201cYour skin has already been thick enough. If it grows a bit thicker, your face would become swollen.\u201dMo Fei ignored Lou Yu\u2019s words. He rubbed his own face and said, \u201cMy prince, my face is thin-skinned and easy to flush, but now I\u2019m flushing not because you are holding me, but because you rubbed my injuries which really hurts! My prince, can\u2019t you be gentle a little bit? If you don\u2019t learn to be gentle, you would be destined to be dumped like a piece of duster cloth.\u201dLou Yu lowered his head to look at Mo Fei, with thick gloominess in his glittering eyes, \u201cMo Fei, what do you say if I throw you out of the window right now?\u201dMo Fei tightly hooked Lou Yu\u2019s neck, \u201cMy prince, how could you do this to me? You are so heartless. How could you be so hardhearted? You make me really sad.\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei, \u201cSo now you feel so sad that you even want to strangle me?\u201dMo Fei looked at Lou Yu and said innocently, \u201cHow come! You think too much.\u201dAfter walking into the bedroom, Lou Yu threw Mo Fei onto the bed.\u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d said Lou Yu drowsily.Mo Fei then looked at Lou Yu plaintively, \u201cI can take them off. But don\u2019t you ever have any evil thoughts because of my perfect figure.\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei, saying smilingly, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry. Your short body would never turn me on.\u201dMo Fei threw his dagger eyes at Lou Yu, grinding his teeth discontentedly! Come on! You are tall, so you can look down on others?Mo Fei then took off his cloths and groveled on the bed, \u201cBe gentle!\u201dWatching Mo Fei\u2019s black and blue body, Lou Yu frowned. Feiyu had really crossed the line this time!When Lou Yu applied the potion on Mo Fei\u2019s body, the latter groaned, \u201cBe gentle! Be gentle! You are so rude! I told you to be gentle! Why don\u2019t you listen to me! Are you on purpose?\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cI\u2019m already very gentle.\u201dMo Fei complained, \u201cYou are really all thumbs! You already make it so painful being gentle? You really have a huge gap to fill between you and Mo Yi! As a man, you should learn to be gentle. Otherwise, no one would like you.\u201dGroveling on the bed, Mo Fei continued, grumbling, \u201cMy prince! You should really change your personality. Hear me out! You\u2019re ill-tempered, and all thumbs, and so stingy. How would you make people like you? Huh? Everyone has his defects, which is understandable. But if you have too many defects, or let\u2019s say, you only have defects but not merits, that\u2019d be bad.\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei\u2019s annoying face, his face turned even darker.\u201cOuch!\u201d Mo Fei screeched, \u201cFuck!

Of course it hurt! Don\u2019t you see the bruises? Are you near-sighted? Near-sighted so seriously at such a young age?

So I come to check you out, in case you got laid by someone against your will.\u201dLou Yu then glared at Mo Yi sullenly, \u201cDo you think your young master is worth me to do so?\u201dMo Yi cast a glance at Lou Yu acidly, \u201cMy prince, don\u2019t belittle our young master! Our young master also has a long list of relationships. Some were even willing to die for him.\u201dLou Yu raised his eyebrows, showing great interest, \u201cOh? Someone was even willing to die for your young master? That\u2019s really hard to imagine.\u201dMo Yi said disapprovingly, \u201cIs that so hard to imagine? Not only one or two were willing to die for our young master. Someone even forgot food and sleep and lost 30 jin(1 jin equals 0.5 kg) for him. That person nearly died of malnutrition. Some even got delusional disorder for him, who was on pins and needles everyday. There were twin brothers who even turned against each other for our young master and even had been hospitalized for a whole month due to a fierce duel.\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Yi with a fake smile, holding his arms, \u201cBut I heard your young master\u2019s second fianc\u00e9 nearly got scared the shit out by your young master\u2019s full face of pimples and nearly hadn\u2019t had anything for a whole month. Finally that person only had skin and bones. And when the seventh fianc\u00e9 had the blind date with your young master, your young master happened to get incurable disease. He was afraid of getting infected and became got anxiety disorder and always suspected he himself also got incurable disease. And that twin brothers, after seeing your young master\u2019s messy hair and yellow teeth, and the big birthmark on the eyelid, in order not to have the blind date with you, they had a really tough fight and finally both were sent to hospital.\u201dMo Yi then turned to Mo Fei with his face turning stiff, while Mo Fei could only rub his nose helplessly.Lou Yu then said dramatically, \u201cMo Yi, so those who claimed to die for your young master are those people?\u201dMo Yi forced a smile, didn\u2019t say a word.\u201cMy prince, you investigated me behind my back!\u201d said Mo Fei whiningly.\u201cInvestigate? Mo Fei, you must be mistaken. You are my wife. As your husband, I think I have the right to know about you more.\u201d said Lou Yu gently.Mo Fei said shyly, \u201cActually I have nothing worthy to specially dig. I am just a very common person.\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei, saying disapprovingly, \u201cHow come! Since when you become so humble? In any aspect, you should never be categorized into a common one.

He is even more thick-skinned than I am!\u201d said Mo Fei bitterly.Mo Yi rubbed his chin and said, \u201cYoung master, you can buy a cheap one to pay the lip service.\u201dMo Fei rolled his eyes, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m going to buy him something fancy? You really overthink things. It\u2019s not a question of buying something cheap or premium. The thing is that I still have to pay even if I buy him a cheap one.\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely true! Even a star coin, it is out of your pocket.\u201dMo Fei then said grumpily, \u201cHow could this guy\u2019s birthday the day after tomorrow?

The most important thing is you can buy one and get one free. It\u2019s said the free one is low quality and doesn\u2019t look good, but already good enough for that that rough man!\u201dMo Yi blinked and said, \u201cYoung master, you want to send Prince Yu a doll?\u201dMo Fei nodded and said, \u201cYes! You also know, this guy\u2019s jimbook is too tough. I\u2019m afraid this guy would never marry a real beautiful woman, but only a false one. I\u2019m only afraid even a false beautiful woman couldn\u2019t bear that asshole and has air leakage in a few days.\u201dWhen Mo Yi was about to say something, suddenly the expression on his face changed and he said at the door coldly, \u201cWho is hiding at the door? What do you want?\u201dSu Rong toughened his scalp and came in.Mo Fei looked at Su Rong and asked unfriendly, \u201cSu Rong, what are you doing in the doorway?\u201dSu Rong smiled awkwardly and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t hide in the doorway. I just didn\u2019t come in in time.\u201dMo Fei gave him a cold hum, while looking at him unfriendly.Su Rong ignored Mo Yi, and said to Mo Fei hastily, \u201cLord Mo Fei, I seem to overhear you and Mo Yi were talking about the birthday gift for the prince.\u201dMo Fei nodded and said, \u201cYeah, yeah! I\u2019m thinking about it. Do you have any good suggestions?\u201dSu Rong smiled stiffly and said, \u201cLord Mo Fei, the prince is a hero among men. I\u2019m afraid he has little interest in dolls.\u201dMo Fei disapprovingly looked at Su Rong, saying with an innocent tone, \u201cBut how do you know? Would he also tell you such private thing?\u201dSu Rong smiled awkwardly and said, \u201cNo, I just guessed.\u201dMo Fei disdainful looked at Su Rong, \u201cYou guessed? Then it\u2019d be definitely wrong.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLord Mo Fei, recently Mo Bei Weapon Shop has introduced a batch of source weapons, and the prince fancies a sword.\u201d Su Rong reminded him.Mo Fei looked at Su Rong and asked, \u201cA sword? How many star coins does it cost?\u201d\u201cTwo hundred million!\u201d Su Rong took a careful look at Mo Fei.Mo Fei\u2019s heart suddenly quivered, but his face was still calm, \u201c200 million? So it is 200 million. A sword 200 million? Are they trying to rob money? It\u2019s not as good as a doll. I\u2019d love a doll if it were me.\u201d\u201cThe prince is really not into dolls.\u201d Su Rong said.Mo Fei looked at Su Rong pitifully, \u201cAny man would like such things. Of course, men all like duplicity. If someone asks me, I would also say I don\u2019t like them, but actually deep in my heart I like them very much.\u201d\u201cBut the prince\u2026is not an ordinary man.\u201d said Su Rong.Mo Fei looked at Su Rong and said, \u201cSu Rong, you mean the prince\u2026has a problem\u2026of his man\u2019s part?\u201dSu Rong freaked out, \u201cLord Mo Fei, I absolutely have no such meaning.\u201d\u201cCome on! I know you mean that. How come an ordinary man doesn\u2019t like it, unless\u2026\u201d Mo Fei was trying to indicate something.Su rong\u2019s face went white. \u201cLord Mo Fei, I really\u2026 \u201dMo Fei then smirked and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so anxious. Rest assured. I won\u2019t tell the prince that you said he has impotence behind his back\u2026\u201dSu Rong: \u201c\u2026.Lord Mo Fei, have I offended you or what?\u201d\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Mo Fei asked back.Su Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Fei looked at Su Rong\u2019s idiotic appearance, \u201cYou don\u2019t even know how you have offended our young master? Oh man! You are an absolute idiot.\u201dSu Rong awkwardly looked at Mo Yi, \u201cPlease enlighten me.\u201d\u201cYou egged on our young master to buy the prince a 200-million present! 200 million! It\u2019s whole 200 million!\u201d said Mo Yi with emotion.\u201cYes, two hundred million! Do you know how many delicious Black Forest cakes 200 million can buy? A million! A million!\u201d said Mo Fei emotionally.\u201cThe delicious Black Forest cake is like two thousand each.\u201d Su Rong whispered.\u201cYeah, two thousand. Do you have a problem?\u201d asked Mo Fei.Su Rong smiled awkwardly and said, \u201cLord Mo Fei, 200 million won\u2019t buy 1 million black forest cakes, only 100,000.\u201dSu Rong reminded him.MoFei then said contemplatively, \u201cSo it is calculated one more zero! Are you laughing at my poor arithmetic?\u201dSu Rong hurriedly said, \u201cNo, of course not.\u201dMay Fei puffed up the air and said: \u201cHum, you better not.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he saw Mo Fei walk in, he immediately showed a bright smile.\u201cMo Fei, Prince Yu\u2019s birthday is near, do you know?\u201d Yan Chen\u2019s eye blinked, he looked at Mo Fei and asked.\u201cYes, how can I not know? He\u2019s my husband!\u201d said Mo Fei naturally.\u201cWhen did you know?\u201d asked Yan Chen.\u201cI\u2019ve known it for a long time,\u201d Mo Fei said with a bit shy smile.Mo Fei thought to himself, \u201cWhen did I know? Only yesterday! If Lou Yu didn\u2019t tell me, how would I know?\u201dWell, speaking of which, he really didn\u2019t know much about Lou Yu. Mo Fei suddenly felt a little guilty, but thinking of Prince Yu\u2019s snoring everyday which disturbed him from having a sound sleep, Mo Fei\u2019s guilt immediately vanished completely.Yan Chen held his chin and asked, \u201cWhat present are you gonna buy him?\u201d\u201cThis, this is\u2026a secret.\u201d said Mo Fei mysteriously.Yan Chen said excitedly, \u201cIt must be something special, right?\u201d\u201cOf course, it should be special.\u201d said Mo Fei proudly. Of course his present should be \u2018special\u2019.\u201cMo Fei, you must know about Prince Yu very much, right?\u201d asked Yan Chen.Mo Fei nodded and said, \u201cSure, sure, how would not know about him? I even know he likes snoring and snores loudest when he sleeps on his side!\u201dYan Chen widened his eyes, \u201cWhat? Prince Yu snores? Chenchen doesn\u2019t like snoring. He said I snore, like a piggy.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cComing, coming.\u201d Someone cried, and then a slovenly old man walked toward the classroom.Yan Chen frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s strange! The old man comes so early today!\u201dMo Fei sighed in his heart. This old man should aim at me. I have always stayed in low key. Why would I get eyed on! I am really down on my luck this year!Once the old man stood before the teacher\u2019s desk, the whole room fell silent.Perhaps he was secretly feeling that the old man, though disagreeable, had some real authority and was difficult to tackle with.\u201cMo Fei! Have you finished what I asked you to write?\u201d The old man asked Mo Fei wickedly.\u201cIt\u2019s all done.\u201d \u201cHe stood up, trembling.The old man carelessly looked at the thing that Mo Fei passed over, said angrily, \u201cHum, look at what you wrote. So ugly.\u201dMo Fei forced a smile, thinking, \u201cI\u2019ve already written it all. Why are you still so picky?\u201d\u201cMo Fei, I heard that you got a good beat yesterday, with a bloody nose and swollen face, is that true?\u201d gloated the old man.Mo Fei\u2019s face went all red, \u201cI am not powerful enough, so, yeah, I got a good beat, like you said.\u201dThe old man looked at Mo Fei, \u201cI can tell you really have an annoying face the first time I saw you. And your constitution is also quite suitable to take a beating! Although you got such a good beating that even your mother couldn\u2019t recognize you, and only after a night\u2019s rest, you are all good.Mo Fei then said awkwardly, \u201cTeacher, you must be kidding.\u201d This goddamn old man is so wicked!After staring at Mo Fei for a while, the old man suddenly asked, \u201cMo Fei, do you know who invented the Phantom Steps at the age of 12?\u201dMo Fei\u2019s eyes fast rolling, heart pounding, damn it, why would this old man always ask him something beyond his knowledge? Inventing the Phantom Steps at the age of 12? Only God would care who it is!\u201dInventing the Phantom Steps at the age of 12? That person should be a super genius! Is it you, my teacher, if I may guess?\u201d Asked Mo Fei carefully. He remembered that Prince Yu told him this E Zuishuai (literally means \u201cI am the most handsome man.\u201d in English) is a cultivation genius.When everyone in the classroom heard Mo Fei\u2019s answer, they all looked at him at the same time, with dense astonishment in their eyes.Mo Fei felt kind of uncomfortable and uneasy under so many pair of eyes. Damn it! Did I say something improper again? Why are those people all staring at me like that? Don\u2019t look at me like that? I am thin-skinned. I would be shy!Mo Fei then turned to Yan Chen, while Yan Chen dropped his jaws, eyes wide open, with only misbelief on his chubby face.That bad old man smiled, saying gloomily, \u201cI admit that I am the same level genius as Prince Yu, but I didn\u2019t invent the Phantom Steps, but Prince Yu.\u201dHis words gave Mo Fei a headache. What the hell! Last time he answered that it was Prince Yu and it turned out it wasn\u2019t him, while this he guessed it was someone else, but it happened to Lou Yu the asshole! Why is he so unlucky every time?\u201cSo it turned out to be Prince Yu!\u201d said Mo Fei awkwardly.The old man then looked at Mo Fei with a fake smile, \u201cMo Fei, now you are Prince Yu\u2019s wife, so you better know more about him, otherwise, you know\u2026hehe.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then how can you not know Prince Yu created Phantom Steps when he was 12 years old? This made a great stir at that time!\u201dMo Fei could not help but have a headache. When that thing had happened, he hadn\u2019t transmigrated into this world! How would he know?Mo Fei could only say embarrassedly, \u201cI accidentally forgot.\u201dActually Mo Fei was burning inside. This annoying Lou Yu! Why would he invent Phantom Steps to embarrass him! So annoying!When the old history teacher came to the door of his office, he found an unexpected visitor.\u201cAlas, isn\u2019t this Prince Yu? You are such a busy bee! What brings you here?\u201d The history old man\u2019s cracking sound was really harsh.Lou Yu smiled, saying with a very respectful tone, \u201cI specially come to make an apology in person.\u201dThe old man picked his eyebrows, saying a little bit arrogantly, \u201cYou must be kidding, my prince. Come in please.\u201dLou Yu nodded and then went into the room following the history old man.History old man took off his shoes, sat on the chair, rubbing his wrinkled feet, lazily looking at Lou Yu, \u201cMy prince, suit yourself, please.\u201dLou Yu\u2019s face stiffened. There were quite a few chairs in the room, but they were all piled up with other stuff. He had nowhere to sit at all. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good. I\u2019ll just stand here.\u201dHistory old man also didn\u2019t insist, \u201cMy prince, what brings you here to see me?\u201dLou Yu forced a smile, \u201cI read those applications sent to me a few days ago and found that they accidentally withheld yours. So I specially come to apologize.\u201dThe history old man wagged his head, \u201cOh, I see.\u201dThen Lou Yu took out a cultivating formation from his Space Ring and handed it to the history old man, \u201cThis is the cultivating formation you asked for.\u201dThe history old man immediately put on a smile, saying while rubbing the formation, \u201cThis should be quite expensive.\u201d\u201cIf you want it, I can give you 50% off.\u201d said Lou Yu painfully.The history old man\u2019s eyes were shining. But he still pretended to hesitate for a bit and said, \u201c50% off? Mm, not bad. But I don\u2019t have so many star coins.\u201dLou Yu\u2019s mouth twitched a bit, \u201cThey you don\u2019t have to pay. I can give it to you for free.\u201dThe history old man said suspiciously, \u201cIs it appropriate?\u201dLou Yu then said helplessly, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dThe history old man looked at Lou Yu appreciatively, \u201cI know you are smart enough.\u201dLou Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cMy prince, about your wife! You should really regulate him!\u201d said the history old man earnestly.Lou Yu frowned, \u201cMr. Shuai, did he make any mistake again?\u201dThe history old man looked at Mo Fei with great sympathy, \u201cWhat should I say about your wife? The top ten most famous prostitutes of Luoshui Lakeside three thousand years ago, he was familiar with every one of them even their parents\u2019 name. And those favored concubines in history, he even knew every detail of them, even their infant names. But, on the very contrary, he even doesn\u2019t know that it is you who created the Phantom Steps. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s absurd?\u201dLou Yu couldn\u2019t help blushing. Before they got married, he had been worried that Mo Fei would fall in love with him like crazy and chase after him like a pervert. But at this moment he finally realized that his worried were totally unnecessary. This guy had never put him on his heart at all!Mo Yi said before, his young master was into women, and Lou Yu had taken it as a joke, but at this moment Lou Yu sobered up. So what Mo Yi said was true.Lou Yu had kind of mixed indescribable feelings.The history old man looked at Lou Yu\u2019s expression and then patted his shoulder, \u201cActually, it\u2019s no big deal. Just try to regulate him.\u201dLou Yu nodded and gritted his teeth, \u201cI will have a good discipline of him.\u201dMo Fei and Mo Yi were walking in the campus now. Suddenly Mo Fei touched his own neck.\u201cYoung master, are you feeling unwell?\u201d asked Mo Yi.Mo Fei then nodded, \u201cYeah, kind of. I feel a little cold behind my back. I feel like someone is plotting against me.\u201dMo Feyi said suspiciously, \u201cYoung master, you overreacted, I guess.\u201d\u201cI hope so!\u201d said Mo while shaking his head.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But he still answered, \u201cYeah! I\u2019m back. I\u2019m just back.\u201d\u201cYour history teacher told me you know nothing about me, but know the details of every famous prostitute in the past three thousand years.\u201d said Lou Yu flatly.Mo Fei frowned, thinking to himself, \u201cNever expected that old freak would rat on me! This old scoundrel is so annoying!\u201d\u201cHehe, my prince, your past is way too colorful, sorry I don\u2019t have much time to know about it.\u201d said Mo Fei shyly.\u201cYou don\u2019t know much? You don\u2019t know at all! You are my wife but know nothing about me. Don\u2019t you think you\u2019ve gone too far?\u201d Lou Yu raised his voice grumpily.Lou Yu\u2019s words gave Mo Fei a headache. Lou Yu is so nitpicking!\u201cMy prince, don\u2019t be mad. That\u2019s because I\u2019m afraid you may suspect I pry into your privacy if I know too much about you.\u201d said Mo Fei innocently.Lou Yu looked at Mo Fei sullenly, \u201cExcuse!\u201dSpeaking of which, Lou Yu threw a book at Mo Fei, while Mo Fei caught it in tearing hurry.\u201cBiography of Prince Yu?\u201d cried Mo Fei lightly involuntarily.\u201cYou bet!\u201d Lou Yu slightly raised his chin.Mo Fei said adoringly, \u201cMy prince, you are so young and already has your own biography? And such a thick one? I\u2019ve always thought that biography is written by someone else after one is dead.\u201dLou Yu stared at Mo Fei firmly, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dMo Fei took a few steps back subconsciously, and gave a hollow laugh, \u201cI was just saying. I never meant to curse you. You have to believe that I always wish you to live to a ripe old age! I swear!\u201dLou Yu snorted, \u201cI know. Of course I know. You wrote it before! If I die, you will live in widowhood! And this biography, you must recite it from stem to stern, not to miss even a word.\u201dMo Fei\u2019s mouth twitched. He looked at Lou Yu weirdly, blaming Lou Yu\u2019s autarchy in his heart.\u201cMy prince, what\u2019s written in this biography? How could it be so thick? Is it possible it even includes at what age you still sniveled and how long you have cried and at what age you had bed-wetting? Do I really have to recite those stuff?\u201dLou Yu glared at Mo Fei, \u201cHow would a biography include such things?\u201d\u201cWho knows? This book is so thick. If you didn\u2019t write those odds and ends, how would it be so long?\u201d said Mo Fei reasonably.\u201cThere\u2019s none of those things in the book.\u201d said Lou Yu.Lou Yu pouted and leaned close to Lou Yu, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d said Lou Yu unhesitatingly.Mo Fei then said sullenly, \u201cWithout those things, it would never sell well. My prince, you should know most women are interested in those things.\u201dLou Yu sneered, \u201cAre you also interested in those things?\u201dLou Yu gave him a hollow laugh, \u201cKind of.\u201dLou Yu\u2019s face sank but returned to normal after a second, \u201cYou are interested? Then I will never tell you.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Fei opened the book and read loudly, \u201cLou Yu, third prince of Rong Kingdom, highly gifted, super talented, quick-witted, erudite and informed, versed in both literature and military affairs. Prince Yu bore high aspirations since he was very young, self-disciplined, lenient with others, doing morning exercises, working hard and aiming high.

Hey, how about you introduce that guy to me? I also want him to write my biography. Though he is a bit verbose, it\u2019s nicely written. You contact him for me. I won\u2019t let him do it for free. I\u2019ll pay him 2,000 star coins. What do you say?\u201d said Mo Fei in spirits.Lou Yu looked at Mo Fei\u2019s two fingers, and said angrily, \u201cNot good!\u201d\u201cNot good? Why? Is it that I pay not enough? But 2,000 star coins are a lot.\u201d said Mo Fei.Lou Yu looked at Mo Fei coldly, \u201cHe promised to write it for me because he admires me. Do you think he\u2019d admire you?\u201dMo Fei said shyly, \u201cI\u2019m so outstanding.

Mo Yi scratched his head painfully, \u201cYoung master, you really plan to buy Prince Yu a doll?\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cSure! I already said it like 100 times.\u201dMo Yi frowned, \u201cDo you really think it\u2019s appropriate?\u201dMo Fei looked at Mo Yi disapprovingly, \u201cHow is it not appropriate? Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s fine. Even if he said he doesn\u2019t like it, in his heart he\u2019d definitely like it. He is a surprise package. Do you think I don\u2019t know about him?\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m afraid Prince Yu may punch you.\u201d muttered Mo Yi to himself.Mo Fei then said excitedly, \u201cYiyi, look at this one. It\u2019s replicated the international super star Rong Yue\u2019er, rosy lips, white teeth, curvy figure, big eyes, small mouth. What do you say, huh? Isn\u2019t it pretty? Alas, Rong Yue\u2019er is my ideal goddess forever!\u201dMo Yi said helplessly, \u201cYoung master, when you ever fancied the actress Xiyao before, you also said she is your goddess forever. Unfortunately, the second day news came out that Xiyao had been married, and your goddess had also changed.\u201dMo Fei\u2019s face darkened, \u201cI\u2019m asking you whether this doll is pretty or not. What bullshit are you talking about? Why do you switch the topic?\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cYeah, very pretty. Young master, do you plan to send this doll to Prince Yu?\u201dMo Fei shook his head, \u201cOf course not. The salesman said if I buy this one, he will send another one imitating Lin Qinglin for free. Lin Qinglin has flopped now, but she is not bad. I can send it to Prince Yu.\u201dMo Yi said helplessly, \u201cYoung master, if you have made up your mind, then buy it.\u201dMo Fei rubbed his hands, \u201cOK.\u201dMo Fei bought two dolls as he had planned. The salesman then thoughtfully packaged the dolls tightly. No one could tell what was inside judging from the outside.When Mo Fei and Mo went out of the shopping mall, they happened to see that Yan Chen was in the Eat Eat Eat Restaurant on the other side of the shopping mall.On seeing Mo Fei and Mo Yi, Yan Chen waved at them with excitement.Then Mo Fei and Mo Yi then walked towards himThen sat on the opposite side of Yan Chen, then Yan Chen waved at the waiter, \u201cAnother two shares of what I have just ordered.\u201dMo Fei looked at Mo Fei feelingly, \u201cYanyan, you are the best.\u201dYan Chen then said shyly, \u201cYou overpraise me.\u201dLike he remembered something or what, Yan Chen then switched the topic, \u201cMo Fei, Xu Zihan\u2019s lover is coming back in a few days. Xu Zihan has claimed that he wouldn\u2019t go easy on you. So you\u2019d better make precautions.\u201dIt really gave Mo Fei a headache, \u201cWhy is that surname Xu haunting me like a ghost?\u201d Alas, that \u00a0son of bitch! I have to find a chance to poison him into an ugly monster!Mo Fei kept lowering his head, saying nothing.Yan Chen looked at Mo Fei, \u201cMo Fei, Chenchen is selling a kind of mini star armor. This kind of armor could be worn next to the skin. It\u2019s just like ordinary clothes, but could resist the attack of level four powerhouses. Would you like one?\u201d\u201cDoes such star armor really exist?\u201d asked Mo Fei suspiciously.Yan Chen nodded, \u201cYeah. Wearing it, you\u2019d only get beaten half dead by Xu Zihan\u2019s lover instead of getting beaten to death.\u201dMo Fei said doubtfully, \u201cYanyan, that\u2019s not how you advertise. You should say it this way. After wearing the star armor, I\u2019d stay unscathed instead of getting beaten half to death by Xu Zihan\u2019s lover.\u201dYan Chen scratched his head, \u201cBut, that kind of mini star amour could only resist the attack of a level 4 powerhouse, but not very effective against level 5. I heard Xu Zihan\u2019s lover has quite possibly promoted to level 5.\u201dMo Fei frowned, \u201cLevel 5 already? Oh no, how could that ill-tempered and brainless son of bitch Xu Zihan be so goddamn lucky?\u201dYan Chen shook his head, \u201cHow would I know?\u201dMo Fei touched his chin and said to Yan Chen, \u201cYanyan, does your Chenchen\u2019s shop have a kind of star armor that can improve the offensive power?\u201dYan Chen nodded, \u201cYeah, sure. There\u2019s a kind of star armor that could magnify ten times of a level 3 star magician\u2019s ATK, five times of a level 4, and two times of a level 5.\u201dMo Fei touched his chin thoughtfully, \u201cThere\u2019s really such good stuff!\u201dYan Chen nodded, \u201cSure! But it\u2019s a bit expensive.\u201dMo Fei raised his eyebrows, \u201cHow much?\u201d\u201c500 million.\u201d said Yan Chen.Mo Fei held his forehead speechlessly.

    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: Running into Yan Chen (2)Noticing Lou Jing\u2019s beaming eyes and all smiles, Lou Feng asked leisurely, \u201cJing, do you have some great news?\u201dLou Yu smiled mysteriously, \u201cToday I came across Mo Fei in the shopping mall.\u201dLou Feng frowned, and asked doubtfully, \u201cMo Fei?\u201dLou Jing nodded, \u201cYeah, it is Mo Fei. He was selecting birthday presents for Lou Yu.\u201dLou Feng looked at Lou Jing\u2019s despising face, asking, \u201cDid Mo Fei buy Lou Yu some kind of \u2018special\u2019 present?\u201dLou Jing sneered mischievously, \u201cMo Fei bought Lou Yu a doll.\u201d\u201cA doll?\u201dLooking at Lou Feng\u2019s face with all question marks, Lou Jing sulked, \u201cThat kind of emulational dolls you men are all fond of. Mo Fei is really penny-pinching. It\u2019s buy one and get one free. And Mo Fei planned to send Lou Yu the free one.\u201dLou Feng laughed grimly, \u201cNot all men like that kind of stuff, like me. It\u2019s like real though, it\u2019s still not real. Only losers would like that kind of stuff. Those who are capable enough would be surrounded by real beautiful women. How would they have time for fake ones?\u201dA slice of disdain flashed across Lou Jing\u2019s face, \u201cIt\u2019s quite reasonable. That kind of stuff is only suitable for losers like Lou Yu.\u201dThe corners of Lou Feng\u2019s mouth showed a slice of sneer, \u201cLou Yu\u2019s birthday is tomorrow. Then let\u2019s open the gift Mo Fei bought in front of everyone. That\u2019d be very interesting.\u201dLou Jing curled up her lips, \u201cI can already picture it!\u201dLou Feng narrowed his eyes, \u201cMo Fei bought Lou Yu that kind of stuff, which shows their relationship is not as good as it appears.\u201dLou Jing grinned, \u201cLou Yu only has Lin Feiyu in his heart. How would he get along with Mo Fei?\u201d\u201cI heard Mo Fei even didn\u2019t know Lou Yu invented Phantom Steps at the age of 12, like he didn\u2019t put Lou Feng in his heart at all.\u201d Lou Feng tapped the desk lightly.\u201cWhat? That guy is really absurd!\u201d said Lou Jing surprisingly, eyes wide open.Although Lou Jing disliked Lou Yu, but when she found that even Mo Fei the bumpkin who enjoyed a bad reputation out there also looked down upon Lou Yu, she felt kind of uncomfortable.Lou Feng nodded, \u201cYeah, kind of.\u201dOrdinarily speaking, if a common civilian married into the imperial family, like a Cinderella story, he would hold his head high to the outsiders but with reverence and awe to the whole royal family. But it seemed that Mo Fei had no such sense at all. Lou Feng didn\u2019t know why he always thought Mo Fei was kind of quirky.\u201cWhat is Lin Feiyu doing?\u201d asked Lou Jing.\u201cPreparing the birthday present for Lou Yu.\u201d said Lou Feng.Lou Jing raised her brow, \u201cWhat is he gonna send to Lou Yu?\u201d\u201cFeiyu said he is gonna refine some level three potions for Lou Yu himself.\u201d said Lou Feng.Lou Jing nodded, \u201cHe is so thoughtful as always. But I don\u2019t know whether Lou Yu would accept his good intention after marrying Mo Fei.\u201dLou Feng looked at Lou Jing, asking, \u201cDo you think Feiyu is no better that Mo Fei?\u201dLou Jing chuckled, \u201cHow is that possible?\u201dIn the study, Lou Yu was sitting in the chair sullenly.Su Rong served aside with great trepidation, \u201cMy prince, you are not in the mood?\u201dLou Yu raised his head and turned to Su Rong, \u201cSu Rong, am I famous?\u201dSu Rong nodded, \u201cOf course, my prince! Your heroic deeds have spread all over the country. No one hasn\u2019t ever heard of your big name.\u201d\u201cReally? But Mo Fei doesn\u2019t know.\u201d said Lou Yu wearing a wry smile.Su Rong\u2019s body went a bit stiff and he asked tentatively, \u201cMy prince, it seems you really care about the Crown Princess\u2019 attitude.\u201dLou Yu raised his head and looked at Su Rong ghastly.Su Rong lowered his head awkwardly. When a couple fights, the one who suffers is always an outsider! Oh no! He is so doomed.\u201cTomorrow is my birthday. What present do you think Mo Fei will prepare for me?\u201d asked Lou Yu.Su Rong smiled awkwardly, \u201cMy Prince, I don\u2019t know!\u201dSu Rong thought in his heart, \u201cYou would never want to know!\u201dLou Yu leaned back in his chair, eyes narrowed. Normally, when it was time for his birthday in the past years, he always expected Lin Feiyu\u2019s gift, but this year, he was expecting what Mo Fei was sending him.It felt like a cat\u2019s paw was scratching in his heart, so itchy! He wanted to know but had no guts to reveal the answer ahead of time.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Seeing the three of them, an elite man like and elite-dressed elite glass man walked out toward them.Yan Chen called on seeing him, \u201cChenchen!\u201d and then ran at that elite man.Mo Fei watched that Yan Chen threw himself at that elite man and left two oily handprints on the elite man\u2019s pricey suit.The elite man didn\u2019t get mad but took out a white handkerchief instead and wiped the hands for Yan Chen and then said elegantly and unhurriedly, \u201cYou forgot to wash your hands again after eating the food. How many times should I tell you?\u201dYan Chen looked at the stained suit of the elite man and said with his face blushing due to awkwardness, \u201cI will remember it next time.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d Yan Chen\u2019s other half is really good-natured!The elite man then turned to Mo Fei, \u201cYou must be the third Crown Princess! Thank you for taking care of Yan Chen.\u201dMo Fei wore a shallow smile, \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s Yanyan who has always been taking care of me. Actually I didn\u2019t do much for him.\u201dThe elite man smiled disapprovingly and then said humorlessly, \u201cYou take Yanyan\u2019s place and be the tailender in so many subjects. How could you say you didn\u2019t do much for Yanyan?\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d This asshole!The elite man looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cYanyan told me you are a very rare talent. I\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting you, my Crown Princess.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d Is this guy being sarcastic?\u201cYanyan told me you sell clothes and do it big at such a young age. I\u2019ve always admired you in my heart.\u201d sucked up Mo Fei.\u201cI\u2019m just doing some small business. I\u2019m not even close to the third prince.\u201d said the elite man humbly.Mo Fei smiled slightly and then said blandly, \u201cActually except being shrewish, Prince Yu has no other capabilities.\u201dSpeaking of which, Mo Fei noticed that Yan Chen and the elite man were both staring at him with bright piercing eyes, he could only add, \u201cI was kidding, you know.\u201dYan Chen looked at Mo Fei and then turned to Jing Chen, \u201cChenchen, Mo Fei is here to buy clothes.\u201dJing Chen\u2019s eyes immediately shone, \u201cSo the third Crown Princess is here to buy clothes.\u201dYan Chen then nodded, \u201cMo Fei wants to buy some next-to-skin clothes.\u201dJing Chen peered at Yan Chen blandly, \u201cIt\u2019s not next-to-skin clothes, but mini star armors!\u201dYan Chen scratched his head, stuck out his tongue, saying coyly, \u201cSorry, I remember it wrong again.\u201dJing Chen gave him a light smile, in which was full of love and tolerance.Jing Chen took a glance at Mo Fei, \u201cI wonder what kind of mini star armor you would like.\u201dAfter thinking for a bit, Mo Fei said, \u201cI need one to strengthen the fighting capacity and another defensive one.\u201dJing Chen looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cHeaven-fighting Star Armor could greatly increase your fighting capacity, 500 million. The defensive armor could resist attacks from a level 4 star magician, 300 million. Since Prince Yu is Yanyan\u2019s best friend, I can give you thirty percent off, 560 million in total.\u201dMo Fei blinked, Yan Chen\u2019s face is really useful! 30% off!Yan Chen pouted and said to Jing Chen, \u201cChenchen, knock off the odd star coins and make it 500 million, OK?\u201dJing Chen peered at Yan Chen and nodded, \u201cAll right.\u201dMo Fei looked at Yan Chen touchingly, which made Yan Chen a little shy and he lowered his head.Mo Fei then readily took out his star card to pay.Yan Chen tipped his toes to watch the 500 million being transferred into Jing Chen\u2019s account, and then exhaled a breath of relief silently and said, \u201cChenchen, congrats! The arrears of stock in your shop are finally sold. You should thank me.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d So what am I feeling touched for?! This pair of assholes!Jing Chen pushed up the glasses on the bridge of his nose, \u201cActually, mini star armors have superb performance.\u201dYan Chen wore a bitter face, \u201cBut too expensive!\u201dYan Chen then turned to Mo Fei, \u201cFeifei, you are really well off! It seems Prince Yu is quite generous to you!\u201d\u201cKind of, kind of.\u201d Mo Fei lowered his head pretending to be sky, thinking: Prince Yu is actually a goddamn petty guy!\u201cMo Fei, you bought two items. Which one is for the third prince?\u201d asked Yan Chen curiously.Mo Fei said disapprovingly, \u201cWhy would I give one to him? One is for me, the other is for Yiyi.\u201dYan Chen popped his eyes out, \u201cSo you won\u2019t buy one for Prince Yu?!\u201dMo Fei said deservedly, \u201cHe is loaded recently. If he wants one, he can buy for himself. I don\u2019t have extra star coins for him!\u201d\u201cMo Fei, what about you buy one more? I\u2019ll ask Chenchen to give you a discount!\u201d said Yan Chen.Mo Fei turned his face sideways, thinking: Young man, do you think I will be fooled again right after I got tricked?Seeing Mo Fei ignored his proposal, Yan Chen felt a little despondent.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Model?\u201d asked Mo Fei doubtfully.\u201cHmm, Star Sword is an eighth grade source weapon, occupying incredible power. But it had been missing for over two hundred years. This one is a model. It seems powerful, but made of plastic. It has its shape but not a bit of its lethality. Just for decoration.\u201d said Jing Chen.Mo Fei immediately said with excitement, eyes wide open, \u201cYou got to send it to me.\u201dJing Chen said wonderingly, \u201cAre you interested in Grand Star Sword?\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cYes, yes, I have heard of its legend since I was young. I\u2019ve always dreamt that one day I would have a chance to see the real one with my own eyes. Grand Star Sword is the sweetest dream in my heart! I\u2019ve always wished that I could control it and become a legendary swordsman.\u201dMo Yi then pulled the sleeve of Mo Fei and whispered, \u201cYoung master, you still had no idea what the Grand Star Sword is a moment ago!\u201dMo Fei\u2019s face turned a little red but he still said to Jing Chen reasonably, \u201cI just got ensnared by the two of you. Anyway, you have to give this sword to me.\u201dJing Chen nodded and said blandly, \u201cSince you like it, of course it belongs to you.\u201dIf it was a real one, of course Jing Chen wouldn\u2019t agree. But since it is just a model, since Mo Fei likes it, he would show a friendly gesture.Mo Fei then nodded contentedly, and patted Jing Chen\u2019s shoulder, \u201cit\u2019s so generous of you!\u201d\u201cOh, you really flatter me, my Crown Princess.\u201d said Jing Chen flatly.Mo Yi pulled Mo Fei\u2019s sleeve and muttered, \u201cYoung master, why would you want a plastic sword?\u201dMo Fei answered unconcernedly, \u201cA present for Prince Yu of course!\u201dMo Yi frowned, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you\u2019d send him a doll?\u201dMo Fei then touched his chin and said, \u201cThe doll has flopped, but it is like beautiful flower in my heart. It\u2019s a waste to send it to him. How would a man so tender toward women like me bear to see it get tormented in his hands? I decide that I will save it for myself.\u201dMo Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dYan Chen blinked and asked out of curiosity, \u201cA doll? What doll?\u201d\u201cNothing, just an ordinary doll.\u201d said Mo Fei.Yan Chen hummed slightly, \u201cHum, Mo Fei, are you taking me as a fool?\u201dMo Fei forced a smile, \u201cHow come! Yanyan, you overthink things. How would I take you as a fool?\u201dYan Chen then leaned close to Mo Fei, \u201cHum! I saw you enter into East Wind Shopping Mall. That thing is the top seller in there recently. Which star did you buy? I also wanted to buy one. But Chenchen didn\u2019t allow me.\u201dJing Chen glanced at Yan Chen, with kind of warning in his eyes. Yan Chen then stuck out his tongue and said nothing.Jing Chen then took out the model of Grand Star Sword and handed it over to Mo Fei.Mo Fei then took it with satisfaction.After taking another round in Jing Chen\u2019s shop, Mo Fei bought a Xuanshui Sword for Mo Yi and then took his star car and left contentedly.Siting in Mo Fei\u2019s private star car, Mo Yi asked, \u201cYoung master, you use a model sword to slight over Prince Yu, will be get upset?\u201dMo fei lazily sat in the star car, saying grumpily, \u201cWhy would I give it a shit whether he is upset or not. He often gets upset!?Mo Yi caught a glimpse of Mo Fei, \u201cBut I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate.\u201dMo fei sneered and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there\u2019s nothing inappropriate when getting him involved. It\u2019s his birthday! There will be a lot of people sending him presents. No one would pay attention to my present. And he himself wouldn\u2019t focus on what I have prepared for him for his birthday.\u201dMo Yi then turned to Mo Fei, \u201cYoung master, are you being jealous of Lin Feiyu?\u201dMo Fei gave Mo Yi a filthy look and asked, \u201cDo you think Lin Feiyu is worth me to be jealous of?\u201dMo Yi shook his head, then Mo Fei smiled slightly, \u201cEnd of story. Who the hell is Prince Yu? However good he is, he is still a man. I am only into women!\u201dMo Yi said suspiciously, \u201cYoung master, are you really sure you are into women?\u201dMo Fei then looked at Mo Yi, \u201cOf course. Are you doubting of that?\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cBut you have never hugged a woman or a man.\u201dMo Fei\u2019s face turned all red, \u201cShut up!

    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: Nervous Su RongWhen Mo Fei and Mo Yi went back to Prince Yu Mansion, they saw that Su Rong was walking up and down in the hall anxiously.Mo Yi then asked, \u201cHm? What are you doing here? Shouldn\u2019t you stay with Prince Yu in the General\u2019s Mansion now?\u201dSu Rong answered awkwardly, \u201cI\u2019m here to see if you need anything.\u201dMo Fei said blandly, \u201cYou are so thoughtful. What would we be short of? We have everything we need here! Oh, what I only need is some sleep. So I\u2019m going to my room and take a nap. No one should disturb me.\u201dWhen Mo Yi was about to leave, Su Rong suddenly grabbed his arm, and Mo Yi gave him a cold stare.Su Rong released his arm, and eagerly asked: \u201cYou and the Crown Princess went to buy dolls?\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cYeah!\u201dSu Rong\u2019s face twitched.Mo Yi shrugged, \u201cSu Rong, relax. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dSu Rong looked at Mo Yi and said, \u201cMo Yi, tell your young master to stay calm.\u201dMo Yi then answered him flatly, \u201cSu Rong, my young master has always been calm.\u201dSu Rong said disapprovingly, \u201cI have different opinion.\u201dMo Yi then held his arms, \u201cGo back to sleep now. Young man, you\u2019d get old easily if you don\u2019t sleep when you are sleepy.\u201dSu Rong said, \u201cOnly three hours and Prince Yu\u2019s birthday party will begin!\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cWell, I got it. I will tip Mo Fei to wake up later.\u201dSu Rong then said, \u201cCan you also tip your young master to change another birthday present?\u201dMo Yi held his arms, heaved a sigh and said sympathetically, \u201cMy young master has always been a determined person, you know.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dWhen Mo Yi walked toward Mo Fei\u2019s bedroom, a dense star source force was gathering from inside. Mo Fei\u2019s face showed a gentle smile. So the young master is going to promote!With dense star source force constantly infusing into Mo Fei\u2019s body, he finally got promoted to grade two.Mo Yi opened the door and looked at Mo Fei, \u201cYoung master, congrats!\u201dMurphy moved his hands and feet, feeling the power in his body, very good.\u201cIf I got a chance to fight that toy boy Lin Feiyu again, I will never be so embarrassed like last time.\u201dMo Yi gave him a smile, \u201cYoung master, since you got beaten up by toy boy Lin last time, your power has been skyrocketing. In a sense, you should thank him.\u201dMo Fei glared at Mo Yi, \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? Are you even my servant?\u201dMo Yi shrugged, \u201cYoung master, change your clothes. The dinner party is starting soon.\u201dMo Fei nodded and said flatly, \u201cFine, I know.\u201dMo Fei looked at Mo Yi, \u201cIt seems you are going to promote to level 4!\u201dMo Yi nodded, saying confusedly, \u201cWith the cultivating formation, it\u2019s much faster. I can vaguely feel that I nearly made it but still couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s really not that easy!\u201dMo Fei patted on Mo Yi\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cIt\u2019s OK. If you can\u2019t defeat surname Xu\u2019s lover, we can run. His lover has already been a major general at such a young age. It\u2019s no shame to throw in the towel under his hands.\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cI know.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cYiyi, don\u2019t give yourself too much pressure. Fool\u2019s haste is no speed.\u201dMo Yi smiled slightly, \u201cI know.\u201dThen Mo Fei put on a formal dress and went to the palace with Mo Yi.In the palace, Lou Yu was surrounded be people, accepting their compliments.From time to time, Lou Feng\u2019s eyes crossed the crowd and looked toward the door, as if he was expecting something.Then Lou Feng held Lin Feiyu in his arms and walked toward Lou Yu. He smiled at Lou Yu and said, \u201cCongratulations, Yu!\u201dLou Yu then nodded at him slightly, \u201cThank you!\u201dLou Feng looked at Lou Yu blandly, but in his heart he felt kind of uneasy. In the past Lou Yu would always stare at Lin Feiyu, but now the way this guy looked at Lin Feiyu was like Feiyu was only a random guy.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The old Lou Yu had never been so indifferent to him. Was Mo Fei really so important to him?Lou Feng held Lin Feiyu in his arm tightly, but didn\u2019t see any jealousy or sadness in Lou Yu\u2019s eyes like before, which kind of upset him.Mo Fei was wearing a white formal dress, making his quite outstanding among the crowd.While Mo Yi followed behind, keeping silent.When Lou Yu saw Mo Fei, there was a slice of astonishment flashing in his eyes. Mo Fei has advanced to a level 2 star magician! What a rapid cultivation speed!Apparently Lou Feng also noticed it. But he had seen too many talents, so he didn\u2019t put it on his mind at all.When Su Rong saw Mo Fei, he felt stressed out of his control.Mo Fei moved to Lou Yu\u2019s side, then took out a gift box, \u201cThis is for you.\u201dLou Feng showed a slice of weird smile, \u201cLou Yu, the present the third Crown Princess has prepared for you should be splendid. What about you open it and stun us?\u201dLou Yu\u2019s eyes wrinkled, he then looked over to Lou Feng coldly.Lou Jing covered her mouth and grinned, \u201cLou Yu, don\u2019t be so stingy! Just a present. You don\u2019t need to hide it from us.\u201dSu Rong then said nervously, \u201cThe third Crown Princess has specially prepared it for Prince Yu. Of course Prince Yu should save it for himself.\u201dLou Yu peered at Su Rong indifferently, \u201cSu Rong, that is a wrong theory. We just want to take a look. We wouldn\u2019t grab it.\u201dSu Rong frowned and said hastily, \u201cMy princess, don\u2019t push Prince Yu.\u201dLou Yu said coldly, \u201cSu Rong, I didn\u2019t push him. You are just exaggerating things.\u201dSu Rong\u2019s face turned red under Lou Jing\u2019s gazing.Lou Yu then stretched out a hand to untie the ribbons, while Su Rong looked away and Lou Jing showed some kind of complacence on the face.After the gift box was opened, a sword was lying in it quietly.Lou Jing\u2019s eyes twitched. She then turned to Mo Fei and said with a stern voice, \u201cHow could it be a sword? Aren\u2019t you supposed to send him an inflatable doll?\u201dMo Fei\u2019s lips curled up and showed a bright smile. He then held Lou Yu\u2019s arm and said, \u201cMy princess, how could you say that? Prince Yu and I are newly married. We are still joined at the hip. How would he need that kind of stuff? How could you slander me like that?\u201dLou Jing\u2019s face turned all red, \u201cBut I saw it with my own eyes!\u201d\u201cMy princess, you may have made a mistake.\u201d said Mo Fei unhurriedly.Lou Jing snorted, \u201cNo way.\u201dMo Fei blinked and said innocently, \u201cMy princess, where did you see me, if I may ask?\u201dLou Jing, \u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cJing\u2019er, say no more.\u201d Lou Feng cut in, \u201cMo Fei, why do you send a plastic sword to Lou Yu?\u201dMo Fei smiled and then explained, \u201cThis is not a common plastic sword. It\u2019s an imitation of the Grand Star Sword. Prince Yu had a special hobby of swords. But I think only the Grand Star Sword is good enough for him. But it has been missing for over two hundred years. So I could only send him a sample. I will try my best to find the real one for him!\u201dLou Jing snorted, \u201cTo find the real Grand Star Sword? Mo Fei, are you telling us a joke?\u201d\u201cFaith can move mountains. But I believe as long as I have the perseverance, I will find it some day. Like as long as you have the perseverance, you will also succeed losing your weight.\u201d said Mo Fei.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lou Jing glared at Mo Fei, face turning livid.Mo Fei smiled blandly, wearing an innocent expression.Lou Jing looked at the smile on Mo Fei\u2019s face and clenched her fists hard. This son of bitch! He must be on purpose to make fun of her before everyone!Lou Yu closed the gift box and looked at Mo Fei, \u201cThank you for the present. I like it a lot.\u201dLooking at the expression on Lou Yu\u2019s face, Mo Fei suddenly felt a little guilty,\u201cAs long as you like it. As long as you like it.\u201d Mo Fei said obsequiously.Lou Yu then looked at Mo Fei, with a bit of confusing feeling in his eyes.Seeing Lou Yu\u2019s eyes were all on Mo Fei, Lin Feiyu felt kind of frustrated.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But he doesn\u2019t necessarily send it to the prince!\u201d said Mo Yi disapprovingly.\u201cWhy suddenly change the gift?\u201d asked Su Rong confusingly.\u201cIt was just a momentary impulse.\u201d said Mo Yi flatly.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you inform me ahead of time! It nearly scared me to death!\u201d said Su Rong with his heart still fluttering with fear.Mo Yi looked at Su Rong, \u201cYoung man, you are really not poised enough. Don\u2019t get so easily startled.\u201dSu Rong said grumpily, \u201cLike you have witnessed a lot of big occasions!\u201dMo Yi smiled lightly, \u201cThose big scenes I have experienced with my young master are beyond your imagination.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201d So who is the real one who has seen the world?!MO Yi looked at Su Rong, \u201cYoung man, you really need experience and toughening.\u201dSu Rong said shortly, \u201cThank you for your advice.\u201dMo Yi looked at the crowed and suddenly a slice of hatred flashed in his eyes as if he saw someone.Su Rong followed the direction where Mo Yi\u2019s eyes were at and saw a noble and well-dressed lady. Then Su Rong looked back at Mo Yi and Mo Yi\u2019s face had already resumed its quietness as \u00a0before.Yan Chen also looked at the direction where Mo Fei was at while eating the birthday cake, grunting, \u201cMo Fei is really a bullshit talker!\u201dJing Chen peered at Yan Chen and said, \u201cDon\u2019t mention this to anyone!\u201dYan Chen nodded, \u201cI know. Mo Fei is really good at cheating. How I wish I could be a great cheater like him!\u201dJing Chen cast a glance at Yan Chen coldly, \u201cWhat? Who are you gonna cheat?\u201dYan Chen looked at Jing Chen, heaved a sigh, didn\u2019t say a word, but only thinking to himself, \u201cChenchen is really not so easy to fool like Prince Yu.\u201dLou Feng leaned close to Lou Jing, \u201cAll right. Don\u2019t be mad!\u201dLou Jing grinded her teeth, \u201cThat goddamn Mo Fei must have been fooling around with me. Who the hell does he think he is? How dare he fool me?\u201d\u201cCome on. That\u2019s no big deal. Don\u2019t make it a fuss!\u201d said Lou Feng blandly.Lou Jing frowned, \u201cOur mother betrothed Lou Yu a wife in order to disgust him. But why do I have feeling that Lou Yu likes Mo Fei. They are kind of a perfect match!\u201dLou Feng narrowed his eyes, \u201cThat Mo Fei is really strange.\u201dLou Jing looked at Mo Fei\u2019s direction, eyes narrowed, \u201cThis guy has embarrassed me again and again. When he falls into my hands next time, I will let him beg for his death!\u201dLou Feng also gave Mo Fei a look, \u201cJust a nobody! Do you really need to make such a big fuss?\u201dLou Jing said coldly, \u201cMo Fei is really overconfident to take up the challenge from the granddaughter-in-law of General Zheng. Zheng Xuan will come back soon. His good days are over.\u201dMo Yi walked to Mo Fei who was engorging in a corner, \u201cYoung master.\u201dMo Fei gave Mo Yi a glance and asked, \u201cEh? Yiyi? What\u2019s up?\u201dMo Yi shrugged his shoulders, \u201cYoung master, can you dance?\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cOf course.\u201d Then he leaned close to Mo Yi, \u201cYour young master I can sing and dance well. I am versatile. Don\u2019t fall in love with me.\u201dMo Yi rubbed his nose, \u201cYoung master, later you\u2019re going to have the opening dance with Prince Yu.\u201dMo Fei hesitated a bit, \u201cI can only do the male side\u2019s steps. So he will do the female steps?\u201dMo Yi shook his head, saying regretfully while looking at Mo Fei, \u201cYoung master, I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201dMo Fei then looked laden with anxiety, \u201cThat\u2019d be a big trouble.\u201dMo Yi then blinked, \u201cYoung master, what to do?\u201dMo Fei scratched his head, \u201cHow am I supposed to know?\u201dMo Yi looked at Mo Fei, saying helplessly, \u201cYoung master, then you can only play it by ear.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s also what I am thinking.\u201dLou Yu leaned close by Mo Fei\u2019s ear while grabbing his hands and dancing, whispering, \u201cThis is the fifth time you stepped on my foot. Are you dumbass?\u201dMo Fei then said to Lou Yu in low voice, frowning, \u201cI have no choice. If you switch your role with me, I promise I will never step on you again.\u201dLou Yu gave him a bright smile, \u201cYou wish!\u201dMo Fei wore a bitter face, \u201cThen you could only take it.\u201dAll the guests made a circle, watching Mo Fei and Lou Yu dancing in the center.Yan Chen widely opened his star eyes, saying in an exciting tone, \u201cNever expected Prince Yu and Mo Fei could so intimate.

He had ever observed Lou Yu before, of his breaths, five long and one short, lips looking a little bit purple, a little red inside his pupils, a little mulberry in his fingernails, anxious for quick results, all these symptoms showed that his meridians had been badly injured, but now it seemed he had got lot better.Mo fei\u2019s eyes shrunk. Ethereal Spiritual Body! With such a constitution, even he got injured, he could get recovered along with his level up. Why would such an ethereal body be owned by son of bitch Lou Yu? Was it the \u2018fortune favors fools\u2019???This is sad! Male god Mo Fei is so remarkably smart who would never have this kind of fortune that only favors fools!The birthday party was finally over at 3 a.m. in the morning.Mo Fei hopped onto the star car while yawning, with Lou Yu following behind and sitting on the opposite side of him.Looking at the you-owe-me-a-few-billion expression from the man on the other side, Mo Fei\u2019s sleepy feeling almost dissipated.\u201cAre you OK? Do you feel uncomfortable?\u201d asked Mo Fei, eyes blinking.Lou Yu stared at Mo Fei and gritted his teeth, \u201cI already knew it!\u201dMo Fei looked at Lou Yu, a little confused, \u201cHm? What did you know?\u201dLou Yu stood up and said, \u201cStop pretending! About the sword! When you bought Heaven-fighting Star Armor worth 500 million and Xuanshui Sword for Mo Yi, you happened to see a model of the Grand Star Sword, so you asked for it for free and sent it to me. Before you went to buy the star armors, you even had no idea of what Grand Star Sword is at all! So in your heart, I am not even a patch on Mo Yi\u2026\u201dMo Fei also flared up and instantly stood up, \u201cWhat the hell are you? What makes you think you can compare with Yiyi? You think you are really something since you are the third prince? You think you are really something since you are a level five master? Even the whole world thinks you are superb, in my heart, you still can\u2019t even compare with a finger of Yiyi! You really overestimate yourself!\u201dThere were only four people in the star car. Once Mo Fei finished his words, all the other three were struck dumb.Lou Yu looked at Mo Fei a little dully, and the anger on his face dispersed a lot, lost in a fog instead.Su Rong looked at Lou Yu and Mo Fei, bewildered.\u201cIn my heart, you can\u2019t even compare with a finger of Yiyi!\u201d Mo Fei\u2019s words kept resounding in Lou Yu\u2019s ears.Lou Yu suddenly remembered that when they first met, Mo Fei had ever said to him that he couldn\u2019t even compare with a finger of Ouyang Qi. He knew he was kidding. But this time, it seemed he was serious.Lou Yu peered at Mo Yi behind Mo Fei and forced a bitter smile, \u201cYou are right. You are right. I overestimated myself.\u201dLou Yu got up and stepped into one of the rest rooms in the star car.Su Rong stared at Mo Fei blandly and came to his sense after quite a while.Looking at Lou Yu\u2019s decadent and a little bent back, Mo Fei suddenly felt a little guilty.Su Rong looked at Mo Fei and said doubtfully, \u201cLord Mo Fei, don\u2019t you think your words are too heavy? After all you are a couple.\u201dMo Fei caught a glimpse of Su Rong, \u201cA couple? We are just a fake couple. It\u2019s just an arranged marriage. We both had no choice. We already made a deal before the wedding. We shouldn\u2019t interfere with each other.\u201dSu Rong frowned, saying cautiously, \u201cBut anyway, you are still a legal couple! Lord Mo Fei, can\u2019t you show some tenderness to the prince?\u201dMo Fei laughed grimly, \u201cDoes he need my care? Am I the one he loves? Relationship is two people\u2019s thing. Even if he loves me, it is my freedom whether I would love him or not! Su Rong, do you think I have to love him and care about him since he is the third prince?!\u201dSu Rong smiled awkwardly, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\u201cYou better not. He has chased after Lin Feiyu for so many years, but Lin Feiyu still doesn\u2019t love him back. Since he has no feelings for me at all, why should I love him? Am I no better than Lin Feiyu? Do I have to love someone Lin Feiyu dumped?\u201d said Mo Fei coldly.\u201cYoung master, you are drunk.\u201d Mo Yi frowned.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d said Mo Fei disapprovingly.\u201cYoung master, even if you don\u2019t care about Prince Yu. After all you are sitting on the same boat now!\u201d said Mo Yi.Mo Fei frowned, \u201cI know. We are all sitting on the same boat.\u201dSu Rong thought to himself, \u201cBe it the third prince or the third crown princess, both are not to be trifled! So, what to do now?\u201dLou Yu leaned against the door, his heart sunk since Mo Fei\u2019s words kept incoming his ears.Su Rong scratched his head bitterly. Before he had been worried that the wife Prince Yu married would chase after him. But now it turned out his worries were completely not necessary Maybe, Prince Yu was the one who had feelings for the Crown Princes, while the Crown Princess\u2019s heart was still as hard as a stone.Mo Fei heaved a sigh slightly, the expression on his face became complicated.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Or maybe he drank too much at the banquet and wants to use the bathroom.\u201dMo Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dSu Rong scratched his head, having a headache.The three of them then walked into the hall. Mo Yi gave Mo Fei a look and asked, \u201cYoung master, are you going to sleep now?\u201dMo Yi said vacillatingly, \u201cI haven\u2019t had enough at the banquet. I\u2019ll go grab some food first.\u201dMo Yi looked at Mo Fei with kind of hesitation, \u201cYoung master, is it possible you are afraid?\u201dMo Fei glared at Mo Yi, \u201cHow could I be afraid? Do I look like I am joking? Your young master I fear neither heaven nor earth! Go get me some food.\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cAll right.\u201dSu Rong looked at Mo Fei. After having hesitated for a while, he asked carefully, \u201cLord Mo Fei, do you need to eat something to boost your courage?\u201dMo Fei\u2019s face darkened. He then said, \u201cIdiot! Food would go into your stomach, but not your gallbladder. Eating food can not boost your courage, but could only boost your stomach.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Yi handed over some cakes and beverages, and sucked up, \u201cYoung master, you are really literate. Su Rong is not on the same level with you at all.\u201dMo Fei chortled, \u201cYeah, of course. Your young master I am the most well-educated person.\u201dSu Rong hid his face, thought to himself, \u201cTen subjects, eight red lights hung over! Doesn\u2019t Mo Fei feel ashamed to claim himself to be the most well-educated person???\u201dMo Fei noticed Su Rong\u2019s twisted face, \u201cSo what is the problem with you? Do you find anything inappropriate with my words?\u201dSu Rong gave him a hollow laugh, \u201cHow could it be? Lord Mo Fei, you are definitely an intellectual. But it\u2019d be better of you would be a little bit more literate.\u201dMo Fei dug a big spoon of cake and stuffed into his mouth, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know, knowledge is boundless. I will continue to exert myself.\u201dSu Rong then said affably, \u201cMy lord, then please keep up the good work!\u201d At least do not hang red lights in so many subjects!Mo Fei looked at Su Rong and said disapprovingly, \u201cYou better mind your own business.\u201dSoon enough, Mo Fei had finished all the food Mo Yi got for him.Mo Fei cast a glance at upstairs and then said to Mo Yi grumpily, \u201cWhy did you only bring me such little food? I am not full.\u201dMo Yi looked at Mo Fei innocently, \u201cYoung master, it\u2019s easy to flesh up if you eat too much at night.\u201dMo Fei said disapprovingly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal of that?\u201dMo Yi shrugged and said casually, \u201cNo women will like you if you grow fat.\u201dMo Fei immediately paled with fright.Su Rong then gave Mo Fei a look and said, \u201cLord Mo Fei, if you dare not go upstairs now, you can take a shower first. Maybe after that, the prince has already fallen asleep.\u201d\u201cWho told you I dare not go upstairs?\u201d Su Rong\u2019s words drove Mo Fei in a miff.Su Rong blinked and asked, \u201cSo are you going upstairs now?\u201dMo Fei hid his face and said awkwardly, \u201cTaking a bath first is a good idea, I assume.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Fei had soaked himself in the tub for over an hour and didn\u2019t come out until the skin got wrinkled.While Mo Yi and Su Rong were waiting outside the bathroom.Mo Yi got frightened by the two outside. He then wrapped his body tighter and said, \u201cWhat are you doing here? Were you peeping me?\u201dMo Yi immediately explained, \u201cI saw Su Rong is a bit furtive. I\u2019m afraid he would hold some thoughts he shouldn\u2019t have.

It was quiet in the bedroom. Lou Yu was sleeping on the floor, wrapped up tightly by a multicolored quilt. Last time Mo Fei blamed that Lou Yu had no taste and bought a super vulgar quilt. But right after he blamed Lou Yu, Mo Fei recalled that it was him who bought it on Star website since it was at a super huge discount.Seeing Lou Yu was wrapped like a hibernant worm, Mo Fei pursed his lips and despised Lou Yu\u2019s ugly sleeping gesture in his heart.Mo Fei then glanced at the bed and suddenly noticed that something ain\u2019t no right.Mo Fei suddenly remembered that before he left for the banquet, he stuffed the beauty doll and hid it inside the quilt. But now the whole bed looked very much flat.Mo Fei\u2019s face twitched. He hurriedly walked to the bed and pulled aside the quilt. His inflatable doll had already been flattened, with a huge hole over its head.Mo Fei rushed to Lou Yu and threw a kick at him, \u201cHey, get up! Stop playing possum!\u201dLou Yu opened his eyes and said grumpily, \u201cWhat is wrong with you? Why do you wake me up at such late night?\u201dMo Fei\u2019s face darkened and he said furiously, \u201cHow dare you question me while you broke my beauty doll?\u201dLou Yu flattened his hair, saying angrily, \u201cYour beautiful doll got an air leakage itself. What\u2019s that got to do with me?\u201dMo Fei\u2019s face darkened, \u201cBullshit! It was all good when I left. How could it have an air leakage itself? You must have done something to it!\u201dLou Yu said indifferently, \u201cThe doll you bought has a bad quality. How could you put the blame on me?\u201dMo Fei gritted his teeth and argued, \u201cIt\u2019s expensive. How could it be bad quality?\u201d\u201cHow would I know? You should have bought a false corn. Using money on a baby doll instead of something decent! Can\u2019t you be like a grownup?\u201d said Lou Yu coldly.\u201cFalse corn? They claimed to compensate me ten if it\u2019s false! You must have \u2018tortured\u2019 it while I was away. Don\u2019t try to hide it from me.\u201d Mo Fei sulked.Lou Yu then said coldly, \u201cSee who you bought. Rong Yue\u2019er should have been over 50 now. For her age, she could even be your granny. Are you nuts for fancying her?\u201dMo Fei was dumbfounded. He just knew she was pretty and an A-list celebrity, but never knew that she was already this old.\u201cWhat do you know? Now tadpoling is in trend now!\u201d quibbled Mo Fei righteously.\u201cHum, did you buy an elder sister? It\u2019s a granny! Only those aged guys would buy this kind.\u201d said Lou Yu ruthlessly.\u201cShe is old, so what? She is still gorgeous and beautiful, while you already look like an old man at such a young age.\u201d said Mo Fei grumpily.\u201cWho did you say looks like an old man?\u201d asked Lou Yu ferociously.\u201cYou!\u201d said Mo Fei testily.\u201cSay it again!\u201d Lou Yu then leaned closer to Mo Fei.Mo Fei\u2019s face darkened, \u201cAll right, I misspoke. You are even more childish than a three-year-old kid. You are far from looking like an old man.\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei, gritting his teeth, while Mo Fei also refused to be outdone and glared back at him.Lou Yu then said coldly, \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep now. If you ever disturb me again, I\u2019m gonna beat you up.\u201dMo Fei looked at Lou Yu lying on the floor and then turned to the \u2018dead beauty\u2019 on the bed, and hammered the bed angrily.Lou Yu closed his eyes, but actually was listening any move of Mo Fei.Mo Fei breathed in discontentedly. So after such careful picking and choosing, I nailed myself such an asshole?! I am so down on my luck this year!Mo Fei pulled his hair wearily and threw the \u2018dead\u2019 beauty into the trash can. Even she is aged, she is still a beauty woman! How could this guy do this to her? He is really ruthless, heartless and wicked to the extreme!Mo Fei then opened his own wardrobe, only finding that the complimentary one was also broken!Mo Fei turned his head and gave Lou Yu who was tightly wrapped up in the quilt a hard look! This son of bitch!Lou Yu noticed that Mo Fei dismembered both of his dolls and threw them into the trash can, there was a triumphant smile showing at corner of his mouth.Early the next morningMo Fei walked downstairs, face darkened and prolonged down to the floor.Mo Yi moved forward and asked carefully, \u201cYoung master, are you OK?\u201dMo Fei gnashed, \u201cI am fine, but my big beauty and little beauty both passed away because of that asshole. I swear I\u2019m gonna revenge them!\u201dMo Fei nearly cried when saying the last few words. It cost him quite \u00a0a few million! Even for the sake of money, Lou Yu the asshole shouldn\u2019t do this to them!Mo Yi, \u201c\u2026\u201dSu Rong rubbed his nose, thinking, \u201cLord Mo Fei, don\u2019t make it so scary! Anyway, Prince Yu only broke your two inflatable dolls!\u201dThen Su Rong said hesitantly, \u201cLord Mo Fei, actually those dolls are no good. They could never compare with the real ones.\u201dMo Fei immediately flew into anger, \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t wanna hold the real ones? It\u2019s just no one would love to. What choice do I have?\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201d So is Mo Fei trying to get Prince Yu cuckolded?Mo Fei noticed the subtle change of the expression on Su Rong\u2019s face, so he said, \u201cDo you think that no women would like to throw herself into my arms is because I am not attractive enough?\u201dSu Rong said awkwardly, \u201cHow come!? How could it be possible that you my lord Mo Fei is not attractive enough? No one can ever resist your super charm.\u201d Su Rong suddenly noticed that he was kind of assimilated by Mo Yi gradually.Mo Fei then said coldly, \u201cOf course I\u2019ve got super charm. The reason no women would throw themselves at me is your prince is dragging me down and block those women out. Just wait and see. Some day I\u2019m gonna devoice your prince and marry seven beautiful women. I\u2019m gonna sleep a different one every day from Monday to Sunday.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Yi dry coughed at Mo Fei, raising his eyebrows to signal him to look upstairs.Mo Fei then raised his head, only finding Lou Yu was standing on the stairs, his face immediately turned red.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81: Poisoning (1)To break the atmosphere, Mo Yi forced a smile and said, \u201cTime to eat. Come on. You got class to attend to later. It\u2019d not be good if you are late again.\u201dSu Rong also echoed, \u201cYes, yes, bread is the staff of life, you know. Even if you got something, you can talk about it after breakfast.\u201dAfter Mo Yi placed the breakfast on the table, Lou Yu and Mo Fei sat down nose to nose, both of whom looked sullen.So now four people took four corners and started to have their breakfast.It was weirdly quiet at the table. And at half of the breakfast, Su Rong suddenly screeched.Lou Yu raised his head and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dSu Rong popped out his eyes, staring at Lou Yu, lips trembling.Lou Yu\u2019s handsome face now got pimples all over, from which pus was popping out, looking very horrifying.Lou Yu also looked his own messy face from the metal pillar and stood up instantly.Mo Yi then stood before Mo Fei in the first place.\u201cYou poisoned me!\u201d Lou Yu grinded his teeth.Lou Yu\u2019s eyes was filled with anger, with kind of hidden sadness deep in them.Su Rong looked at Mo Fei and said seriously, \u201cLord Mo Fei, this is not funny. Even the prince broke two of your beauty dolls, you shouldn\u2019t have done this!\u201dMo Fei looked at Lou Yu and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so nervous. It\u2019s something good for him.\u201d\u201cThe prince is already like this, and you said it\u2019s something good?\u201d Su Rong\u2019s face turned gloomy.\u201cI\u2019m serious. Beautifying Potion, hard to obtain even if you got the money! It\u2019s his luck that the young master would use it on him! After taking such potion, all the toxin from inside his body would be excreted through the face, which would last about 12 hours. After the toxin is completely excreted, his skin will become as clean as a whistle, like a shelled egg. That\u2019s something so many people are dreaming of! You should know chalk from cheese!\u201d Mo Yi warned.\u201cBeautifying Potion? Why have I never heard of it? Has anyone used that thing before?\u201d asked Su Rong curiously.\u201cYoung master has tried it himself.\u201d said Mo Yi.\u201cAnd then scared his seventh fianc\u00e9 away?\u201d asked Lou Yu.Mo Yi gave Lou Yu a look and nodded.Judging from Mo Yi\u2019s expression, Su Rong knew it was quite possibly true, \u201cEven if it\u2019s something good, you can\u2019t use it on the prince now!\u201d How could Prince Yu go out now?Mo Fei cast a glance at Su Rong indifferently, got up and said fiercely. \u201cI\u2019d like to feed it to him now, because he ruined my beauties!\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei ferociously, like he was gonna break every bone in Mo Fei\u2019s body, \u201cOnly for two dolls?\u201dMo Fei gritted his teeth and sulked, \u201cDo you know how much the two dolls cost me? 4 million! 4 whole million star coins! How many cakes could I buy with it? Do you know how many brain cells of me would die for only a piece of cake before? It\u2019s a shame to waste! You know?\u201d\u201cFour hundred million indeed could buy lots and lots of cakes. Why don\u2019t you buy a cake instead of that? You asked for it.\u201d Lou Yu patted the table.Mo Fei rolled up his sleeves and said, \u201cGood! Good! You finally admit it, don\u2019t you? Before you said you didn\u2019t break my beautiful dolls, and you finally admit that you did the damage.\u201dLou Yu felt slightly embarrassed, but giving is a second thought, Mo Fei made a mistake first, so he argued reasonably, \u201cYou have crossed the line first. How could buy such things and bring them home? Have you ever considered my feeling?\u201dMo Fei then said coldly, \u201cCome on! It\u2019s just because I didn\u2019t share one with you, so you felt uncomfortable. Why didn\u2019t you say it? If you told me earlier, I may have given you one. I\u2019m quite generous, not like you.\u201dLou Yu pounded the table and jumped to his feet, saying inflame, \u201cWhy would have such bad taste like you do? The dolls you bought are nearly your grandma\u2019s age, and, and one of them has passed away already, and do you know how she has passed away, because she has rolled too many sheets with too many men! Do you have some psychological problem? Why would you buy this kind? Huh?\u201dMo Fei looked over to Mo Yi and said, \u201cSo the complimentary one has passed away? Really because of too many sexual intercourses?\u201dMo Yi scratched his head, \u201cI\u2019m also not very clear.\u201dMo Fei\u2019s face darkened, \u201cAll right, all right. I won\u2019t argue with you about losing two of my beauty dolls. But if I buy another one, you can\u2019t play any tricks.\u201dLou Yu sneered, \u201cBuy as many as you want! But no of them can survive in my place.\u201dMo Fei stood up in a swoosh! He glared at Lou Yu and said, \u201cYou are so unreasonable!\u201dLou Yu gnashed, didn\u2019t say a word.Mo Fei then left angrily, Mo Yi followed behind quickly.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That is always the way Lord Mo Fei behaves.\u201dLou Yu panted, \u201cSon of bitch!\u201d\u201cMy prince, you\u2019d better not go to school today. Have some rest at home. I\u2019ll ask for a day off for you.\u201d said Su Rong.\u201cNo, I have to go to school today.\u201d said Lou Yu categorically.Su Rong frowned, \u201cBut why?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t cut school.\u201d said Lou Yu.Su Rong frowned, thought to himself, \u201cDon\u2019t you often cut school, my prince?\u201d He then said, \u201cMy prince, is it because you heard that Zheng Xuan will be back and he will get back at Mo Fei for Xu Zihan and you are a little worried?\u201dLou Yu glanced at Su Rong and flew into anger, \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? Why would I be worried about him? Mo Fei is so capable, and, and brutal. Does he need anyone else to worry about him?\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026then you don\u2019t have to go to school.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Lou Yu retorted.Su Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Fei sat in the star car, still wearing that resentful expression.Mo Yi looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cAll right, young master. Just two fake beauties? It\u2019s no big deal. You will definitely get some real ones in the future.\u201dMo Fei blinked, \u201cYou are right. Actually it\u2019s nothing to be regretful of. One is aged, the other has been dead.\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cYeah, right!\u201dMo Yi suddenly recalled the expression of the saleswoman when she looked at Mo Fei. At first Mo Yi felt that woman was liking seeing a moneybag, but recalling it now, she was more like seeing an idiot.When Mo Fei walked into the classroom, he saw that Yan Chen was looking at himself sympathetically.\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Mo Fei.Yan Chen shrugged, \u201cMo Fei, you better ask for a leave later.\u201dMo Fei raised his eyebrows and immediately knew what was happening, asking, \u201cSo Xu Zihan\u2019s lover is coming?\u201dYan Chen nodded, \u201cYeah!\u201dMo Fei narrowed his eyes, brushed off the hair before his forehead and said in high spirits, \u201cThis day would come sooner or later. See how your male god Mo Fei is gonna kick his ass.\u201dYan Chen looked at Mo Fei and shook his head, \u201cMo Fei, you are still young. Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself.\u201dMo Fei sneered, \u201cHiding is not my personality. Anyway I can\u2019t avoid it.\u201d\u201cYanyan, Prince Yu and surname Xu\u2019s lover, who do you think is more powerful?\u201d asked Mo Fei curiously.Yan Chen frowned, \u201cIt should be Prince Yu, I guess. They are in the same grade. But Prince Yu ranks before surname Xu\u2019s lover. But do you think Prince Yu would stand out for you?\u201dMo Fei smiled awkwardly, \u201cHe would have no time.\u201d Even if he is available, now he should have no time.Yan Chen, \u201c\u2026\u201dXu Zihan turned around and gave Mo Fei a challenging look.Mo Fei smiled blandly. Mo Yi also peered at Xu Zihan\u2019s direction, with a beaming of cold resent.The whole class could more or less feel the tense atmosphere between Mo Fei and Xu Zihan. They were all waiting for a wonderful show.Other auditors around Mo Yi all looked him pitifully.\u201cMo Yi, Zheng Xuan is here. Did you hear that?\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cMo Yi, later you better stay at a distance from your young master. I heard that Zheng Xuan is going to beat up your young master. If you stay too close, maybe you\u2019d also get involved and take a good beating.\u201dMo Yi said disapprovingly, \u201cI can\u2019t. That\u2019s my young master.\u201d\u201cMo Yi, aren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d\u201cBut I have to protect the young master.\u201d said Mo Yi reasonably.\u201cMo Yi, actually it\u2019s no use even if you help him. So you better keep your nose clean.\u201d A classmate suggested.\u201cNo, I can\u2019t. I should support my young master.\u201d said Mo Yi faintly.\u201cMo Yi, you are so loyal! It\u2019s really Mo Fei\u2019s luck to have a servant like you.\u201dMo Yi titled his head and said earnestly, \u201cMy young master is a talent. It is my honor to serve the young master.\u201dOnce those words came out of his mouth, all those around looked at Mo Yi like he was a weirdo.Yan Chen looked at Mo Yi and then Mo Fei, \u201cMo Fei, Mo Yi is really good to you.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201dYan Chen held his face and said jealously, \u201cMo Fei, where did you find such a silly and na\u00efve subordinate? I also want one.\u201dMo Fei then smiled proudly, \u201cSomeone like Yiyi is really hard to find. You may not have the chance.

Soon class was over.At this time before, the classroom had already been emptied. But today no one moved. Most of them laid their eyes on Mo Fei, some with sympathy while some with gloating.Mo Fei slowly got up and walked out of the classroom, with Mo Fei following closely.Xu Zihan watched Mo Fei\u2019s back, with a smirk on his face.Yan Chen followed by Mo Fei\u2019s side, looking around now and then tensely, like a total green thief.Mo Fei looked at the spooked Yan Chen, \u201cYanyan, if you are really scared, you can stay away from me.\u201dYan Chen shook his head, \u201cZheng Xuan bore no grudge with me. I don\u2019t he would fight me. And maybe I can resist him a bit for you.\u201dMo Fei waved his hand, \u201cNo need. I don\u2019t think you playing as the earthbags would be a big help. You just hide somewhere and don\u2019t get in my way.\u201dYan Chen looked at Mo Fei furiously, \u201cYou ungrateful son of a bitch!\u201d He risked his life trying to lend Mo Fei a hand, while Mo Fei said he was only some bagwork and might get in his way?!!!Mo Fei looked at those students walking on the road, frowning, \u201cI remember there are not so many people at this time before.\u201dYan Chen nodded, saying cockily, \u201cOf course. They are all here to watch how you get humiliated.\u201dMo Fei pouted, \u201cReally? Am I really such a nuisance? I thought everyone loves me!\u201d\u201cYou think too much!\u201d said Yan Chen grumpily.Mo Yi then said blandly, \u201cThere he is.\u201dMo Fei then raised his head and looked ahead, only seeing a handsome but a little cold young man was staring at him, with dense hostility in his eyes.While Xu Zihan was standing beside him, looking quite emboldened on his face.Mo Fei touched his chin, \u201cIs that Zheng Xuan? Never expected he is so cute. Yiyi, what do you say?\u201d\u201cJust so so. Prince Yu is more handsome, I think.\u201d said Mo Fei watchfully while rubbing the Space Ring on his finger.Mo Fei shot out his lips, \u201cWhy did you bring him up suddenly?\u201dMo Yi gave Mo Fei a peep and said coldly, \u201cJust making a casual comment, you know.\u201dYan Chen gritted his teeth, \u201cCan the two of you have a bit of crisis awareness? Huh? He is coming at you\u2026\u201d At such a dangerous moment, these two weirdoes are still gossiping the enemy\u2019s handsome face!?!Before Yan Chen finished his words, a fire dragon flew at Mo Fei.Centered on Mo Yi, a blue water curtain lit up and shielded the three of them.Seeing this scene, a slice of astonishment flashed in Zheng Xuan\u2019s eyes.Mo Yi showed a murderous flash in Mo Yi\u2019s eyes. Then a sky blue long sword showed up in his hand. He then held it up and made a dive for Zheng Xuan.With the speed of lightning, Mo Yi could have put a hole in Zheng Xuan\u2019s body if he had reacted 0.01 second late.Zheng Xuan\u2019s eyes flashed a look of surprise. After that near escape, Zheng Xuan dare not loosen up any more. Xu Zihan told him Mo Fei was only a level one loser, but it turned out Mo Yi was a hidden level three star magician.A series of water arrows emerged from Mo Yi\u2019s hand. Mo Yi was already at the climax of level three. Now under the help of the Heaven-fighting Star Armor, now his fighting capacity had nearly approached level 4. Caught off guard, Zheng Xuan got a tiny cut in the wrist.Zheng Xuan sucked the blood from his hand and a bit of excitement showed up in his eyes. Then the two had a heated fight.A Flaming Tiger showing its teeth pounced at Mo Yi, while an ice blue tiger also appeared behind Mo Yi. Then the two tigers bumped together and turned into dense mist.The dense mist covered the crowd\u2019s sight. And those two rushed into the mist at the same time, with drastic sound of fighting coming out it.Zheng Xuan was powerful enough but didn\u2019t bring any weapon with him.Mo Yi\u2019s power is not strong enough, but he got the star armor and a sword in his hand, plus water restricting fire in star source property. Though he was in the lower hand, it was not so easy for Zheng Xuan to finish Mo Yi.There had already been a lot of students who were watching the show. But seeing Zheng Xuan and Mo Yi having a heated fight, more and more people were gathering.Yan Chen\u2019s eyes were shining and he said with great excitement, \u201cMo Fei, Yiyi is really something!\u201dMo Fei nodded, saying righteously, \u201cOf course my Yiyi is something. He is a level 3 star magician!\u201d\u201cWhat? Yiyi is a level 3 star magician? I think he is way much more powerful than Lin Feiyu.\u201d said Yan Chen.\u201cThat\u2019s a sure thing.\u201d said Mo Fei. What the hell is Lin Feiyu?

Now he finally understood who attacked him in the dark when he fought with Mo Fei that day.Lin Feiyu gave Mo Fei a meaningful look and wondered how Mo Fei would have such a powerful servant.Zheng Xuan\u2019s adopted totally aboveboard military strategies, while Mo Yi used assassinating route and every move of his sword was deadly.Their battle was heating up, which attracted more and more people to watch.Mo Fei narrowed his eyes, thinking, \u201cZheng Xuan is really a nostalie. In order not to take advantage of YiYi, this guy has lowered his power to level 4. So stupid! But as an opponent, the more stupid he is, the better!\u201d\u201cWho is this guy? Why don\u2019t I know there\u2019s such a badass in the Fighting Department?\u201d\u201cThat guy is not from the Fighting Department. He is Mo Fei\u2019s servant.\u201d\u201cThe third Crown Princess\u2019 servant? But never heard his servant is so powerful! He can even fight major general Zheng!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know? I\u2019ve long heard of this guy. During the entrance exam, thus guy broke quite a few bones of a student from higher grade!\u201d\u201cThis guy is so powerful? Even the top student of the Fighting Department in grade one wouldn\u2019t be so powerful, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\u2026The fire dragon\u2019s roaring and the water dragon\u2019s howling were weaved together again and again, which terrified everyone.Not only students, even some teachers gathered to watch them fight.\u201cWho is that student? Why don\u2019t I know him? Our school even has such valiant student?\u201d\u201cThat is Mo Fei\u2019s servant, a level 3 star magician who is sent by Prince Yu here to protect Mo Fei, I assume, accompanying Mo Fei studying in the Elite Class. This guy looks ordinary, but it turns out he just hides himself.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really a waste to serve Mo Fei. Such a talent can never be wasted. I\u2019m gonna recruit him into our class.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s obvious he takes the assassinating route. How could he join your fighting class? It\u2019s a right choice for him to join our class.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about? He occupies water property. Of course he should join our Skywater Class to cultivate.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cZheng Xuan is really an asshole! He is not a student from our school. How could he always come here to act as a bully?\u201d\u201cWe have got to let him suffer!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy to let him suffer!\u201d\u2026This scene made Yan Chen\u2019s blood boiling. Suddenly he rolled his eyes and cried, \u201cDoes anyone who wants to be as powerful as Yiyi? Does anyone want to defeat the powerhouse of level 5 at level 3? Please check the Heaven-fighting Star Armor Skywater company presents for you. With the armor in hand, the whole world is under your feet. You deserve it!\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dAlong with Yan Chen\u2019s words, Mo Yi got repelled a few steps backwards by Zheng Xuan.Yan Chen clenched his fists and said with his eyes shining, \u201cYiyi, you have to hang in there! Whether my Heaven-fighting Star Armor could be a hit is all on you.\u201dAnd then most people turned their eyes towards Yan Chen, which made Yan Chen blush.Mo Fei narrowed his eyes, a sense of foreboding rising in his heart. Mo Yi\u2019s level decided that he could not play a protracted war. If they kept fighting like this, Mo Yi would lose when his source force could not sustain him.Mo Fei moved his body and then rushed towards Xu Zihan. Seeing Mo Fei was launching attack at him, Xu Zihan showed a bit sneer at the corner of his mouth. Mo Fei\u2019s body arts ranked the last in his class while he ranked 21th. So Xu Zihan didn\u2019t think Mo Fei could defeat him at all.Xu zihan raised his fist and threw it on Mo Fei and then the star armor on Mo Fei\u2019s body lit up. The defensive star armor may not resist Zheng Xuan, but more than sufficient to resist Xu Zihan.Xu Zihan\u2019s attack was totally useless and he could only be beaten passively. Xu zihan was beaten repeatedly and his hair was in a mess.Under the eyes of the public, Xu Zihan got beaten by Mo Fei like a drowned mouse, his faced turned all red due to super embarrassment.Noticing Xu Zihan\u2019s predicament, Zheng Xuan left Mo Yi behind and turned to support Xu Zihan.Mo Yi seized the opportunity and stabbed at the vital part of Zheng Xuan, while Zheng Xuan could only dodge it clumsily.Zheng Xuan showed a bit of resentment on the face, while Mo Yi looked at Zheng Xuan indifferently.Xu Zihan got beaten up by Mo Fei, totally devastated, with anger written on his face.Seeing Xu ZIhan got no strength to fight back at all, Zheng Xuan already had no mood to fight Mo Yi.\u201cYoung master, be careful.\u201d cried Mo Yi.On hearing Mo Yi, Mo Fei immediately jumped back.Then the place where Mo Fei had been at got exploded.Mo Yi flashed to Mo Fei\u2019s side and pulled Mo Fei away at a certain distance.Mo Fei lowered his head and saw an over 20 cm wound spanning on Mo Yi\u2019s arm, blood gushing out from it.Mo Fei\u2019s face showed a dense anger. This son of bitch! For his lover, he dare hurt my person!Then a light emerged in Mo Fei\u2019s Space Ring, then five potions appeared in Mo Fei\u2019s hand. Then he threw them at Zheng Xuan and Xu Zizan, while saying \u201cyou son of bitch\u201d.The potions exploded and a dense fragrance gave out.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They are coming!\u201d a student who recognized it said nervously.Most students panicked and ran far away from Zheng Xuan and Xu Zihan, then other students who were still confused also ran away following them.Then the buzzing sound of bees began to arouse. A swarm of walnut-size bees were flying at Zheng Xuan and Xu Zihan.A Riot of Colors had fatal attraction to bees. If Mo Fei used it in the wild, it would attract at least ten times more of the present amount.But even so, so many bees were also a grand sight.A dense swarm of bees flew at Zheng Xuan and Xu Zihan, which made one\u2019s hair stand on end.Zheng Xuan immediately set fire walls around, circling Xu Zihan and himself. When the bees got close to the fire walls, the fire immediately devoured them all.Mo Fei frowned, and shouted with disdain, \u201cLook at this son of bitch! He killed hundreds of thousands of bees all at once. He will get his karma!\u201dYan Chen gave Mo Fei a look, thinking, \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t try his utmost to repel those bees, will he wait to be stung by them?\u201dBut Zheng Xuan was powerful enough. Those bees invited by Mo Fei got killed one swarm after another.Seeing the situation was unfavorable to him, Mo Fei then threw the rest four potions at Zheng Xuan.zheng xuan saw murphy\u2019s move across the wall of fire, forcing the bottle away.Three potions exploded beside Zheng Xuan, while the last one was cast away by the fire dragon Zheng Xuan generated. And then it fell near Mo Fei and Mo Yi and then exploded beside. Mo Yi tried to stop it but still the two got stained by the potion.Although most of the bees flew towards Zheng Xuan and Xu Zihan, a small number flew towards Mo Fei and Mo Yi.Mo Fei got frightened and lost his pace, \u201cNo, no! I don\u2019t wanna get stung to death! It\u2019s really painful!\u201dMo Yi then set water walls around to shut those bees out.Suddenly Mo Yi\u2019s face turned pale and the water walls were also shaking.Mo Fei turned to Mo Yi and asked, \u201cYiyi, are you OK?\u201dMo Yi\u2019s face was covering with cold sweat! Damn it! Why would it choose such a time to promote?Then purple thundering light flashed, those bees trying to getting close to the two of them immediately struck into ashes.Mo Fei then raised his head, only seeing a tall man wearing a mask was standing not far away, but Mo Fei recognized him easily. That was Lou Yu who suffered from his Beautifying Potion this morning.Lou Yu saw that Mo Fei was looking at him. He snorted and then looked away.This was the first time Mo Fei saw Lou Yu fight. Thunder source force was really worthy to be called the most destructive source power. With only a thunder light, thousands of bees kept rustling down.Mo Fei didn\u2019t expect Lou Yu would be at school. He had thought Lou Yu would stay home to recuperate.Looking at Mo Fei\u2019s surprising expression, Lou Yu said grumpily, \u201cMo Yi is promoting!\u201dMo Fei then turned to Mo Yi. Mo Yi looked green around the gills. The heated fight just now had consumed too much of his source force. So even the third prince helped him resist the attack of the bee, it was still not an easy thing to promote.Mo Fei retreated a little. He waved his hand, and then five Spiritual Power Gathering Formations emerged on his hand. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Then the five formations circled around Mo Yi.Everyone was shocked by Mo Fei\u2019s generosity. The Imperial College was the least lack of departments supported by powerful families. But none could provide five formations all at once.The five formations gave out different colors of light, with dense source force gathering around. Feeling the dense star source force, all the students and teachers were amazed, and some were even jealous.The gathered star source force instantly suffused Mo Yi\u2019s dried-out dantian, then Mo Yi closed his eyes and absorbed it mindedly.Then blue stars emerged over Mo Yi\u2019s head one after another, then a grand force burst out of Mo Yi\u2019s body.Yan Chen looked toward where Mo Yi was at excitedly, and murmured, \u201cLevel four now! Level four now!\u201dLin Feiyu clenched his fists tightly. He had always thought his ability was no worse than any common talent. But now even the servant of Mo Fei surpassed him. Lin Feiyu felt kind of unprecedented humiliating feeling.Mo Fei nodded, \u201cHmm, level 4 now.\u201d Mo Fei clenched his fists and thought to himself, \u201cYiyi is already so awesome. I should work my ass off to catch him up!\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After having created such a sensation, more eyes would focus on him!Seeing those bees chasing behind, Mo Fei instantly hopped onto the star car.Mo Yi then followed behind. When he was about to get in, he couldn\u2019t help looking in Zheng Xuan\u2019s direction. Like kind of telepathy, Zheng Xuan also took a glance at him at the same time.Lou Yu covered the retreat, while Su Rong held the line aside.After Lou Yu got into the star car, Mo Fei gave a hollow laugh.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Mo Fei asked tentatively.\u201cI\u2019m having a class.\u201d said Lou Yu grumpily.Mo Fei scratched his head, \u201cI heard you are from the special class. You don\u2019t have to take classes every day. It\u2019s said you wouldn\u2019t come to school almost all the year round.

What is your position to judge me? Even if I don\u2019t go to school, I still got better scores that you. See how many courses you have failed. I really admire you. After failing so many courses, you still have the face to breathe in this world.\u201dMo Fei then looked at Lou Yu suspiciously, \u201cWill you go to hell if you fail as many courses as me? Never expected you are such a fragile person. I really couldn\u2019t tell!\u201dLou Yu grinded his teeth, \u201cShut up!\u201dMo Fei blinked innocently, then asked carefully while looking at Lou Yu, \u201cHow is your face now?\u201dLou Yu flew into anger, \u201cDo you even have the face to ask?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just caring about you! Beautifying Pition is something you can not ask for even if you have the money! So many women are willing to lose her family fortune for it, you know? You \u2018killed\u2019 my two beauties while I return good for evil to give you such good stuff! Shouldn\u2019t you feel grateful and show some gratitude at least?\u201d Mo Fei raised his chin.Lou Yu glared at Mo Fei, \u201cYour ability of confusing right and wrong is really by superb which deserve my knees.\u201dMo Fei then smiled shyly, \u201cActually you don\u2019t have to kneel. By the way, your mask is really cool! Can you spare me one?\u201dLou Yu turned his head, \u201cNo!\u201dMo Fei twitched his mouth, thinking this person was as stingy as always, \u201cWell, about today, thank you!\u201dLou Yu gave him a look, snorted, and just ignored him,Seeing Lou Yu didn\u2019t want to talk to him, Mo Fei cursed this guy in his heart.Watching Mo Yi jealously, Su Rong had the sense of crisis rising in his heart. Mo Yi was already at level 4 now while he was still at level 3. So he would be the one getting beaten in the future. So pathetic!The new that Mo Yi had promoted to level 4 spread like wildfire. Even his background got scouted. All big families started to investigate Mo Yi\u2019s background.\u201cMo Yi, 17 years old, a level 4 star magician?\u201d the headmaster of the Imperial College said angrily.\u201cWhat about the aptitude level? What about his psychic force? Why does he have nothing? A 17 years old level 4 star magician! Top ten of grade one are nothing before Mo Yi. And you even don\u2019t have his entire materials? What\u2019s more, he is just an external student?The college paid little attention to the external students, and had few constraints and limited resources on them. The external students belonged to a group of people who had been put into free range. If the potential external students were valued by other colleges, other colleges could be unscrupulous in poaching them.\u201cSir, he has got S Potion on him.\u201d said the vice-principal.Generally speaking, someone who had received the S potion would have superb aptitude. In most families, it indicated that someone who received such potion was already abandoned by the family. A 17 years old level 4 star magician! What kind of big family would give up on such a figure?The headmaster narrowed his eyes, \u201cS Potion? This is weird! Such a grandmaster is hiding by Mo Fei\u2019s side.\u201d\u201cI think it is quite likely that Lou Yu has put him around Mo Fei. Otherwise, giving Mo Yi\u2019s ability, how could he tame such a young talent?\u201d said the vice principal.The headmaster nodded, saying, \u201cThat makes sense. That\u2019s also what I am trying to say. People all say the third prince doesn\u2019t like Mo Fei at all. Those idiots! If he doesn\u2019t like Mo Fei, how could Mo Fei take out five Spiritual Power Gathering Formations all at once?\u201dThen the headmaster continued, a little excited, \u201cWhen Mo Yi has promoted, did you all feel that dense star source force? Shit! How is it possible I have never known that Prince Yu would dote on his wife like this? If I had known, I should have married my daughter to him.\u201cHeadmaster, do you even have a daughter?\u201d \u201cAsked the vice-principal, somewhat puzzled.\u201cNo!\u201d said the headmaster angrily.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: Reaction of All Sides (1)Translator: Guy Gone Bad12 hours had passed. Lou Yu took of the mask and washed his face clean.Mo Fei really didn\u2019t lie. The Beautifying Potion really made his skin as smooth as a shelled egg. Looking at the fairy face in the mirror, Lou Yu had a rage rising in his heart. With this face, how would he go out to meet people? Lou Yu then smashed the mirror with his fist and the mirror immediately fell into pieces.Mo Fei wanted to use the bathroom. But he bumped into Lou Yu who wearing that scary face, he immediately held it back.Mo Fei forced a smile, \u201cPrince Yu! You become white! Much whiter!\u201d A total toy boy!Lou Yu looked at Mo Fei and asked, \u201cYeah, are you satisfied now?Mo Fei gave him a hollow laugh, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether I am satisfied or not. The point is whether you are satisfied.\u201dLou Yu turned a cold look at Mo Fei and said, \u201cI am far from being satisfied.\u201dMo Fei then said awkwardly, \u201cIf you are not satisfied, you can go get tanned. Given a few more days, and you would become the same as before.Lou Yu gave Mo Fei a dirty look and then walked into the bedroom holding his head high.Looking at the broken pieces of the mirror, Mo Fei held his forehead painfully, thinking, \u201cThis violence freak!\u201dIn them imperial palace\u201cLou Yu, what is on earth the background of that Mo Yi?\u201d asked Lou Jing while turning to Lou Feng.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Lou Feng frowned and clenched his fists.Things became a bit out of control now. During the entrance tests, Mo Yi\u2019s bone age was only 17. A level four star magician at the age of 17??? His is aptitude was as good as Lou Feng now! If Mo Fei became fully winged, Lou Yu would have one more hand. Damn it! He could accept that Lou Yu and Zheng Xuan were ahead of him. But now even Mo Yi could compete with him. A spur of jealousy surged deep from his heart.\u201cIs that Mo Yi Lou Yu\u2019s person?\u201d asked Lou Jing.\u201cThat Mo Yi has been with Mo Fei one year ago. The investigation shows that he is a servant Mo Fei bought with all the money he had.\u201d Said Lou Feng faintly.Lou Jing frowned and asked, \u201cHow is it possible Mo Fei has such ability to tame such a powerful servant? I still think he is someone Lou Yu has secretly cultivated.\u201d\u201cBut it is our Mother Consort who has betrothed Mo Fei to him. Even Lou Yu has ears all over the city, he could never have planted him by Mo Fei\u2019s side one year ago!\u201d said Lou Yu suspiciously.Lou Jing narrowed her eyes, \u201cThis Mo Yi\u2019s background is really mysterious. But brother, you don\u2019t have to worry. Though Mo Yi is surprisingly powerful, he and Mo Fei have already offended Zheng Xuan. If we could rope in General Zheng, what a single young talent can do? Nowadays talents are everywhere.\u201dLou Feng nodded while laughing grimly, \u201cYou are right. Compared with a young talent, of course a general weighs much more. Talents are easy to die young.\u201dLou Jing grinded her teeth, \u201cLucky that goddamn Mo Fei!\u201d She had ever thought that after Zheng Xuan came back, he could have taught Mo Fei a good lesson. But to her surprise, Zheng Xuan was such a useless waste to get beaten up by Mo Fei instead.General Zheng Mansion\u201cYoung master, you are back. The general has been waiting for you.\u201d A servant said to Zheng Xuan reverently.Zheng Xuan nodded and walked into the courtyard.A gallant-looking middle-aged man stood in the yard, his face full of displeasure.\u201cGrandpa.\u201d Zheng Xuan called reverently.Zheng Hong cast a glance at Zheng Xuan and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your face?\u201dZheng Xuan lowered his head and said nothing. The bee waves Mo Fei had brought were too fierce. He got stung quite a few lumps on his face.Zheng Hong glared at Zheng Xuan and exclaimed, \u201cWhat is wrong with you? Your wife lets you go to the east and you\u2019d go to the east, and if he lets you go to the west, and you\u2019d go to the west. You have not been married yet and you already take every word he says. Last time you helped him beat students from the Imperial College and I can let it go. But this time, you have even offended the third Crown Princess and got beaten up, right?Zheng Xuan gritted his teeth. He was indeed too careless. He didn\u2019t know there was someone capable enough by the third Crown Princess and also had no idea he had the A Riot of Colors Potions\u2026He nearly knew nothing about him.\u201cYour wife, who is arrogant, a total bully, ignorant, is not suitable for you.\u201d Said Zheng Hong coldly.Zheng Xuan raised his head and said firmly, \u201cI only want him. Zihan is a bit self-willed, but he has a good heart.\u201dZheng Hong said with an indifferent tone, \u201cI don\u2019t care if he has a kind heart. If he still behaves so boldly, I am gonna undo this match for you.\u201dZheng Xuan became a little anxious, \u201cGrandpa, even if you break out engagement, I will never marry someone else.\u201dZheng Hong glared at Zheng Xuan, \u201cWhatever!

    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88: Reaction of All Sides (2)A graceful and elegant woman, sitting beside Xu Zihan\u2019s bed, looked at Xu Zihan\u2019s horrible face of being stung, and choked with sobs.\u201cHow is Zihan doing?\u201d Xu Qing walked in and asked.\u201cHe has received the painkillers and is asleep now.\u201d said Xiao Mei.Xu Qing frowned, \u201cSince he has already fallen asleep, why are you still crying?\u201d\u201cMy poor Zihan! How could the third Crown Princess be so heartless? My Zihan nearly got stung to death!\u201d Xiao Mei said resentfully, pulling her handkerchief.Xu Qing looked at the person lying in bed, and sulked, \u201cYou better regulate your son. Why would he go provoking the third Crown Princess?\u201dXiao Mei frowned and said, \u201cIt is the third Crown Princess who picked a fight with our son. Instead of standing out for our son, you even scold him! How can you be so heartless?\u201dXu Qing then said wearing a long face, \u201cYou talk to Zihan. Even though Zheng Xuan likes him, he still has got his grandfather in position above him.\u201dXiao Mei gritted her teeth and said, \u201cSo you mean our son got bullied for nothing?\u201dXu Qing glared at Xiao Mei, \u201cWhat else do you want? Whatever his background is, he is the third Crown Princess now. Mo Fei could even take out five cultivation formations at one time, plus he got a master hand by his side. What does it mean? Huh? It means Prince Yu really cares about him. With the cultivation formations, Prince Yu would be like the sun at high noon. But your son has picked such a bad timing to provoke the third Crown Princess. He really couldn\u2019t be more stupid!\u201dXiao Mei gritted her teeth and said, \u201cHow can you say such things about our son?\u201dXu Qing looked at his son in bed and said, \u201cOur Xu Family\u2019s future is all on him. To protect him, we have paid really enough. Even if Zheng Xuan likes him, if he keeps making troubles all day, he would be sick of him sooner or later.Xiao Mei hesitated for a moment and then said, \u201cWhen he wakes up, I will scold him and tell him what he shouldn\u2019t do.\u201dPrince Yu Mansion\u201cYiyi, are you still awake?\u201d asked Mo Fei while looking at Mo Yi who was ruminating by the table.Mo Yi gave Mo Fei a look and nodded, \u201cYeah!\u201dMo Fei gave a look at the wound in Mo Yi\u2019s wrist, then narrowed his eyes, \u201cZheng Xuan that son of bitch is really ruthless. If he had used a little more power, you hand would be wasted.\u201dMo Yi stroked the wound, frowning, \u201cSpeaking of this, when I fought with him\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Mo Fei.Mo Yi said with his eyes narrowed, \u201cI felt like my source force was boiling when we fought. My source force was growing rapidly, like kind of source force resonance.\u201dMo Fei couldn\u2019t help popping out his eyes. Source force resonance was a very peculiar phenomenon which was very rarely seen. If the two who shared source force resonance cultivated together, their power would grow at an amazing speed.\u201cIs it possible you are going to make breakthrough and has kind of illusion?\u201d asked Mo Fei.Source force resonance usually happened on two cultivators who owned the same source force properties. Mo Yi and Zheng Xuan\u2019s properties were inter-restricted. It was unlikely they would have source force resonance.Mo Yi nodded and said, \u201cI hope that it was a wrong feeling. Even if we are, I will never get associated with him.\u201dMo Fei rubbed his nose and said, \u201cThat guy is handsome, but had a pumpkin head to love someone like Xu Zihan. What a shame!\u201dMo Yi nodded slightly, saying faintly, \u201cI also think so.\u201dThe next day\u201cMy prince, your skin really had become much better!\u201d Su Rong gasped in admiration while looking at Lou Yu\u2019s face.\u201cNo one takes you as a dummy even if you don\u2019t talk.\u201d Said Lou Yu grumpily.Su Rong thought to himself, \u201cLike the crown princess said, Lou Yu really doesn\u2019t know how lucky he is! If the Beautifying Potion could be used on my sister, I can picture how happy she would be.\u201dBuilding looked at Su Rong\u2019s expression, asked with a cold face, \u201cWhat is in your head now?\u201dSu Rong hurriedly shook his head, \u201cNo\u2026nothing, nothing.\u201dLou Yu then snorted, thinking, \u201cI must get tanned more and resume my masculine quality.\u201dSu Rong looked at Lou Yu and asked tentatively, \u201cMy prince, are you going to school today?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d said Lou Yu reasonably.Su Rong then said hesitantly, \u201cBut, my prince, yesterday you just said you are gonna turn a new leaf, respect the teachers and never cut school.\u201dLou Yu raised his head and looked at Su Rong unfriendly, Su Rong then embarrassedly shut his mouth.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But apparently I am still as handsome, pretty, cute and kind as always.\u201dMo Yi shrugged, \u201cI got no clue!\u201d\u201cYiyi doesn\u2019t know? But I think I know!\u201d Yan Chen caught up with them, heavily panting.\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d Mo Fei turned to Yan Chen and asked.Yan Chen patted his own chest and said, \u201cAfter you left yesterday, the bees lost control. Swarms of bees flocked in. Xu Zihan nearly got stung to death. You can imagine his screams. So gut-wrenching! That guy Zheng Xuan also got a full face of lumps. Everyone nearly got frightened to death. Finally the teachers lent a hand and saved them.\u201dMo Fei picked his eyebrows, \u201cNearly got stung to death? So you mean they are still alive?\u201dYan Chen nodded, \u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201dMo Fei narrowed his eyes and said kind of disappointedly, \u201cWhat a shame!\u201dLooking at the smile on Mo Fei\u2019s face, Yan Chen couldn\u2019t help shivering.\u201cMo Fei! Why did Prince Yu wear a mask yesterday?\u201d asked Yan Chen curiously.\u201cBecause he thinks that mask is cool!\u201d Mo Fei narrowed his eyes, thought to himself, \u201cWith that face yesterday, if he didn\u2019t wear a mask, how would he show up in front of the public?\u201d\u201cReally? But I think he is cooler not wearing that mask.\u201d said Yan Chen.\u201cHow is that possible? That mask looks good! Much more handsome that Prince Yu!\u201d said Mo Fei disapprovingly.Yan Chen didn\u2019t pick up his words but turned to Mo Yi, \u201cYiyi, you were quite impressive yesterday.\u201dMo Yi lowered his head at Yan Chen to show some courtesy, \u201cYou flatter me.\u201dYan Chen then got a little blushed, \u201cThanks to you, the unsalable mini star armors from my Chenchen are sold out. I should treat you to a big meal.\u201dLooking at Yan Chen, Mo Yi remembered that when he was fighting tooth and nail, Yan Chen was advertising the Heaven-fighting Armors, his face immediately darkened.\u201cThank you, Lord Yan. No need for the big meal. If possible, I hope I can get my share of the advertising fee.\u201d Said Mo Yi both courteously, with kind of sarcasm in his tone.Mo Fei then gave Mo Yi thumbs-up, and Mo Yi smiled humbly.Yan Chen scratched his head, saying, \u201cI will talk to Chenchen about it. Yiyi, are you short of money?\u201dMo Yi shrugged, saying with emotions, \u201cAs for money, plenty is no plague. No one doesn\u2019t like money.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right.\u201d Yan Chen nodded, and then gave a look at Mo Fei, \u201cFeifei, you were also impressive yesterday! Even more impressive than Yiyi.\u201dMo Fei blinked, looking at Yan Chen with a face of exclamation marks, \u201cYanyan, you are a man of vision! What did I do to impress you actually?\u201dYan Chen immediately said without thinking, \u201cThe action you took out the cultivation formations! As many as five in total! Feifei, you were really impressive! You have my knees!\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d So is he impressive or the cultivation formations???Yan Chen then said awkwardly, \u201cFeifei! Can you sell another formation to me?\u201dMo Fei shook his head, \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t. The five cultivation formations are the love token Prince Yu has gifted me. I can\u2019t sell them.\u201dYan Chen looked at Mo Fei in genuine surprise, \u201cSo it\u2019s your love token! If Chenchen sends me five cultivation formations as our love token, I will love him unconditionally and unswervingly with all my heart and soul.\u201d\u201cWhat if the one who sends you five cultivation formations is not your Chenchen?\u201d asked Mo Fei out of curiosity.\u201cThen I will dump him and love that guy.\u201d After thinking for a while, Yan Chen said decidedly.Mo Fei looked at Yan Chen and asked surprisingly, \u201cIs it really good to dump him and love someone else only for five formations?\u201dYan Chen scratched his head and said awkwardly, \u201cYeah, you are right! But that is five cultivation formations!\u201dYan Chen then turned to Mo Fei, \u201cMo Fei, since Prince Yu has sent you five cultivation formations, you will definitely love him unconditionally and unswervingly with all your heart and soul, right?\u201dMo Fei gave him a hollow laugh, \u201cYeah, sure!\u201d Of course not! Who would love that asshole unconditionally? I am clearly level-headed. I am a standard straight man. I am only into beautiful women!\u201cMo Yi, I really admire you!

Almighty and domineering! And with such a dignified appearance!

    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90: The Popular Mo Yi (2)The crowd seemed to be put in motion, more and more beautiful women pushed to the side of Mo Yi, while Mo Fei got elbowed out of the crowd. In the chaos, Mo Fei even got stepped on by quite a few of them.Mo Fei\u2019s face darkened. What the hell! He had been dreaming of having a relationship with a beautiful woman. But no one had ever confessed to him. And now they all threw themselves at Mo Yi, while he even had never held a woman\u2019s hand.Mo Fei heaved a sigh faintly, thinking to himself, \u201cThe most miserable thing in life is that you want some beautiful women but can never get one, while the one close to you doesn\u2019t want one but they all throw themselves at him.\u201dMo Yi looked over to Mo Fei. As expected, Mo Fei\u2019s face was twisted and the way he looked at him was full of jealousy.Mo Yi forced a bitter smile. He was not interested in beautiful women at all, but now\u2026Yan Chen looked at Mo Yi, eyes shining, \u201cYiyi is so popular now!\u201dMo Fei then said jealously, \u201cYeah!\u201dYan Chen looked at Mo Fei, \u201cCome on. Time to go to class now. It wouldn\u2019t be easy for Mo Fei to get free.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cYou are right. It\u2019d be bad if I am late.\u201dWhen Mo Fei went into the classroom, those who disliked his now all looked at him both with surprise and fear, while Mo Fei tossed his head cockily.Yan Chen scanned Xu Zihan\u2019s seat and asked, \u201cDoesn\u2019t Xu Zihan come today?\u201dYan Chen nodded, \u201cHe got stung by the bees severely and now is still in ICU.\u201dMo Fei picked his eyebrows, \u201cThat son of bitch would come to no good to go against Lord Mo Fei.\u201dLin Fei now cast his bland eyes at Mo Fei, while Mo Fei put on a bright and big smile at him provokingly.Lin Fei\u2019s eyes showed a bit of darkness when he saw the smile on Mo Fei\u2019s smile.Later Mo Yi walked into the classroom with a pile of presents. When everyone in the classroom saw Mo Yi, they all made way for him at their fastest speed.Mo Yi then walked to Mo Fei\u2019s side, \u201cYoung master, I have received a lot of chocolate, love heart candies and cookies. Would you like some?\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cYeah, sure. Yiyi, you have become really captivating now. Next time you tell those women you like eating cakes.\u201dMo Yi nodded and took his advice, \u201cOK, I got it.\u201dAfter a daze, Yan Chen finally came to himself, \u201cMo Fei, how could you eat the presents other classmates have sent to Mo Yi?\u201dMo Fei said obliviously, \u201cCome on. What is the big deal? Yiyi doesn\u2019t like deserts. If I don\u2019t eat them, it\u2019d be wasted. Wasting food is a shameful thing, you know.\u201dYan Chen, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Yi sat down in his usual seat, the students around him all hurriedly gave way to him.Those students who had ever suspected that Mo Yi might have a mental problem now all looked at him in fright.Mo Yi also didn\u2019t know how respond. When a few teachers stormed in and walked towards Mo Yi\u2019s direction vie with each other.\u201cMo Yi, I think it\u2019s a waste of your talent to let you be a dependent in the Elite Class. You should come to our Fighting Department. Only in our department can you fully develop your potential.\u201d\u201cMo Yi, judging from your slashing moves, you have the demeanor of our Assassination Department. An instant kill with one move!

But my job is to take care of my young master. I think I like what things are like now.\u201dWhen those teachers still wanted to say something, the school bell rang.Then a messy old man walked in, \u201cYou\u2026what are you doing here? Do you want to hear my lesson?\u201dOn seeing the messy old man, they all ran from the back door.The history old man giggled, saying with a gloomy and cold tone, \u201cHow dare they make trouble in my class?

The competition covered a wide range, from the students\u2019 body arts, potions level and other talents.Wu Gouyue patted the table with a finger, looking at Mo Fei thoughtfully, \u201cI got two quotas for the potions competition, one left for Lin Feiyu, while the other is yours.\u201dMo Fei looked at the teacher, eyes wide open, \u201cTeacher, how am I supposed to have that ability? Given my skills, do you want me to make a fool of myself in front of the public? It\u2019s a total waste to leave the quota to me!\u201dWu Gouyue then wore a light smile, looking at Mo Fei blandly, \u201cMo Fei, you really are too humble.\u201dMo Fei forced a smile, \u201cTeacher, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m too humble, but my ability is really limited I\u2019m afraid.\u201dWu Gouyue then smiled at Mo Fei brightly, saying with a kind and pleasant countenance, \u201cMo Fei, what level of potions can you refine now?\u201dMo Fei then stretched out a finger awkwardly, \u201cLevel one. Teacher, I learn potions a little late, a little left behind others. But I will study hard. I\u2019ve always got an aspiring heart.\u201dWu Gouyue nodded, wearing a fake smile, \u201cLevel one? You are so conservative.\u201dMo Fei smiled awkwardly, \u201cTeacher, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m conservative. That\u2019s my real level.\u201dWu Gouyue then took out a tube and asked Mo Fei, \u201cMo Fei, what is it in the tube? I guess you should be very familiar with it.\u201dLooking at the potion in the tube, Mo Fei\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He then said lamely, \u201cIt\u2019s A Riot of Colors!\u201dWu Gouyue nodded, \u201cRight, it is A Riot of Colors! I have watched your fight with Zheng Xuan that day. At last, you used A Riot of Colors to attract those bees. I was curious at the time. We all know A Riot of Colors could bring in bees. But few people know that common A Riot of Colors could not bring in so many bees like that day.\u201d\u201cAfter testing, as expected, \u00a0it is not an ordinary potion. Its purity is high up to 97 percent, which is several times more effective than the ordinary ones. A Riot of Colors is level five potions. Level potion, with the purity of ninety-seven percent! The one who could have refined such potions is an absolute genius!\u201d said Wu Gouyue with some kind of jealousy flashing in her eyes.Mo Fei blinked and said with a smile, \u201cYeah, right. That guy must be a genius!\u201d\u201cMo Fei, where did you get the potion?\u201d Wu Gouyue asked smilingly.Mo Fei answered without any hesitation, \u201cI bought it on Star website. The seller told me his potion is quality stuff. I have always been worried that I bought some fake stuff. But it turns out to have superb quality. It\u2019s quite expensive, you know.\u201dWu Gouyue leaned on the chair, looking at Mo Fei with a cold smile, \u201cYou are so lucky then. You could even buy such high quality potion on the website.\u201dMo Fei nodded hard, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve always been lucky since I was young. People all call me lucky star!\u201d When Mo Fei remembered that he had never won a lottery, he couldn\u2019t help feeling much guilty for telling such a huge lie.Wu Gouyue looked at Mo Fei disdainfully, and ridiculed him, \u201cAt such a young age, you couldn\u2019t even lie straight in bed.\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have always been a sincere, kind, upright and reliable person. I have never told a lie since I was little. People all say, \u2018Mo Fei, if you keep acting so upright, how are you gonna live in this world?\u2019\u201dWu Goutye couldn\u2019t help sneering, \u201cBullshit! Keep talking bullshit! Let\u2019s see what more kind of bullshit you can come up with.\u201dMo Fei smiled hollowly, \u201cTeacher, how can you say that? How would I dare lie to such a beautiful woman like you?\u201dWu Gouyue looked at Mo Fei gloomily and shook her head, \u201cIt ain\u2019t over till the fat lady(from the novel Harry Porter) sings.\u201dMo Fei frowned, looking at Wu Gouyue with question marks on his face.Wu Gouyue looked at Mo Fei and said unhurriedly, \u201cMo Fei, have you any idea that in three days after one has refined his potion, the spiritual power of that pharmacist would be lingered on the potion? Since I got nothing to do felt a little bored, I have made some comparison between the spiritual power waves I collected from A Riot of Colors and that you left on your potions class.\u201dMo Fei\u2019s heart tightened. Damn it! Doesn\u2019t this woman have her own thing to do?Wu Gouyue then glanced at Mo Fei and said emotionally, \u201cThe inspection result is really out of my expectation.\u201dMo Fei showed a murderous look in his eyes, fists clenched tightly subconsciously.Wu Gouyue noticed the change of Mo Fei\u2019s expression and said with interest, \u201cMo Fei, are you trying to silence me?\u201dMo Fei then put on a shy smile, \u201cHow come? What makes you say that?\u201d Even if he wanted, he couldn\u2019t make it! \u201cTeacher, who else knows about it?\u201d\u201cOnly me for now. Don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t tell anyone else.\u201d said Wu Gouyue.Mo Fei then heaved a sigh of relief.Wu Gouyue looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cMo Fei, so what about the potion competition?\u201dMo Fei forced a smile, \u201cTeacher, since you say so, how can I say no?\u201dWu Gouyue looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to fool around. I need you to win a title.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cI know. I know.\u201dLooking at Mo Fei\u2019s reluctant expression, Wu Gouyue said, \u201cDon\u2019t wear that look like your whole family dies! You should know the first place would win 300 million.\u201dMo Fei\u2019s eyes popped out, \u201c300 million?\u201dWu Gouyue nodded, \u201cYeah!\u201dMo Fei stroked his fingers, \u201cSo much?\u201d\u201cYeah! So remember to show the best of yourself! You and Lin Feiyu are both the crown princesses, don\u2019t you want to overshadow your big sister-in-law?\u201d said Wu Gouyue with a light smile.Mo Fei nodded, \u201cI swear I\u2019m gonna try my best!\u201dWhen Mo Fei came out of Wu Gouyue\u2019s office, Mo Yi had already been waiting outside, \u201cYoung master, is everything OK?\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cYeah.\u201dIt seemed he had really underestimated people of this world! Although he owned the knowledge surpassing this whole world, he still had to consolidate at every step.Seeing Mo Fei was a little down, Mo Yi asked indeterminately, \u201cYoung master, you look not in the mood. Is it because you forced the beautiful teacher to do it with you but got rejected right in the face?\u201dMo Fei gave Mo Yi a sharp look, \u201cDon\u2019t talk bullshit! Such a gentleman like me, how would I do such nasty things? I will wait her to throw herself into my arms willingly.\u201dMo Yi then said sadly, \u201cWhat month of what year will that day come?\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Fei glared at Mo Yi and said angrily, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dMo Yi nodded, \u201cOh.\u201dMo Fei looked around, \u201cIt\u2019s so strange. I see there are so many offices in this building, but it seems only our beautiful teacher is using it.\u201d\u201cI heard one time teacher Wu failed to refine a potion and released a mass amount of poisonous gas which affected the whole floor. Especially the teachers whose offices were near hers. They all vomited and had watery stools, and some even had energielos. Ever since then, no one dares to work beside teacher\u2019s Wu\u2019s office.\u201d said Mo Yi.\u201cWas it really an accident?\u201d asked Mo Fei suspiciously.Mo Yi looked around carefully and said with a very low voice, \u201cSome said it was an accident, while some said teacher Wu did it on purpose. The teachers who were hospitalized happened to be those who often took advantage of her and teacher Wu hated.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d Beautiful teacher is really not someone to be trifled with.Mo Yi looked at Mo Fei and said worriedly, \u201cYoung master, even if you can\u2019t suppress your sex impulse, you can not choose this kind of women.\u201dMo Fei nodded approvingly, \u201cDo I need you to tell me?\u201dMo Yi heaved a sigh slightly, \u201cI\u2019m just afraid you might hang yourself on one tree.\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201d I would be the last person in the world who would hang himself on one tree!If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93: Talent Competition (1)Translator: Guy Gone Bad\u201cMo Fei, so you are here! I\u2019ve been looking for you!\u201d A handsome-looking man walked toward Mo Fei while saying so. It was Mo Fei\u2019s art teacher.Mo Fei looked at him and asked, \u201cTeacher, what can I do for you?\u201d\u201cWell, you know, the department competition is around the corner. I got five quotas for the talent competition and I saved one for you.\u201d said his teacher faintly.Mo Fei blinked, asking with a quizzical tone, \u201cMe? Why me?\u201dFang Cheng said deservedly, \u201cYou play the piano the best. Of course there\u2019s a place for you.\u201dMo Fei said hesitantly, \u201cBut my score is not so outstanding, I mean.\u201d\u201cYour score isn\u2019t outstanding because your singing drags you down. Forgive me to be honest. You really suck at singing. Every single word is out of tune. You really got the nerve to sing.\u201d said Fang Cheng disapprovingly.Mo Fei couldn\u2019t help laughing hollowly. He didn\u2019t plan to sing, but Fang Cheng kept pushing him and even threatened him that if he didn\u2019t sing, he would get zero point. But at last he sang, Fang Cheng that heartless asshole still gave him zero point!Fang Cheng then said to him in a very serious tone, \u201cWhen in competition, never ever open your mouth, or you\u2019d give the game away. But if you can keep your mouth shut, you would still hang in there.\u201dMo Fei hesitated for a bit and said, \u201cTeacher, I\u2019m afraid I am not qualified for such a challenging task. Maybe you can ask find someone else. I can give up on the precious quota.\u201dFang Cheng looked at Mo Fei, saying flatly, \u201cAre you sure? There\u2019re numerous students out there who made their names after the talent competition and all beautiful women would adore you.\u201dMo Fei immediately choked up with emotions, \u201cI\u2019m in!\u201dFang Cheng patted Mo Fei\u2019s shoulder, \u201cThat\u2019s my boy.\u201dMo Yi looked at Mo Fei\u2019s face and shook his head helplessly. His young master was too easy to fool!After Mo Fei went back to Prince Yu Mansion, he directly lay on his back in the sofa.Then Lou Yu came downstairs. When he looked Mo Fei, he asked, \u201cWhy are you back so late?\u201dMo Fei said lazily, \u201cThe teacher asked me to talk about something.\u201dLou Yu narrowed his eyes and asked curiously, \u201cWhat is it about?\u201d\u201cThe art teacher wants me to join the talent competition.\u201d said Mo Fei flatly.\u201cWhat? Talent competition? Is your art teacher insane? What talent do you have? Oh, I remember it. You can sing. But don\u2019t you ever sing \u2018I am the most handsome in the world. No one is more handsome than me, blahblahblah\u2026\u2019 during the competition! If you really sing it, those audience down there would kill you with rotten eggs! And if you die like that, you would really remain infamous and smelly down the history.\u201d said Lou Yu sarcastically.Lou Yu\u2019s face darkened and he glared at Lou Yu, \u201cWhat do you know? I am such a versatile artist. Just a random show and a lot of women would be charmed by me! When I make my face, those hot chicks that are waiting to roll the sheets with me would line from here to Lantsang River! And at that time, you can only live alone in your cold room.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei fiercely, filled with kind of sour and bitter feeling in his heart, \u201cIf you are so capable, then you can go.\u201dMo Fei snorted and went into the study.Su Rong looked at Mo Fei and said, \u201cMo Yi, I heard you are going to participate in the Top 100 Championship.\u201dTop 100 Championship was the highlight of the competitions among departments. Competitions like talent competition could only be rendered as some games for fun at most.Mo Yi nodded, \u201cYeah, before we came back, the teacher from the Fighting Department said there is still one quota for me. But the young master said he\u2019ll need me for the talent competition. So if the two conflicts, I\u2019m gonna give priority to the young master\u2019s talent competition.\u201dSu Rong gave him a hollow laugh, thinking to himself, \u201cIf the teacher from Fighting Department heard Mo Yi\u2019s words, it\u2019d be fun to see the expression on his face.\u201d But instead, he said, \u201cYou are truly devoted to your young master.\u201d\u201cSure thing.\u201d said Mo Yi reasonably.Mo Yi then turned to Su Rong and asked in curiosity, \u201cAre you taking part in the Top 100 Championship?\u201dSu Rong nodded, \u201cOf course, anyway I can also been rendered as one of the top students in our department.\u201dMo Yi said thoughtfully, \u201cSo the top students of the Imperial College were most of your kind, I see\u2026\u201dLooking at Mo Yi\u2019s disapproving face, Su Rong asked crossly, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dMo Yi put on a bright smile, lips curled up, \u201cI see why the teachers of your Fighting Department would be so brazen-faced to beg me to join in the championship.\u201dSu Rong\u2019s face turned red immediately, \u201cWhat are you referring to?\u201dMo Yi patted Su Rong shoulder and said, \u201cPrepare some more medicine, just in case.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What kind of friend is he??? Su Rong scratched his head remorsefully. What is the big deal of promoting the level four?! I will also make it some day!Mo Fei opened the door and saw Lou Yu who was cultivating in the bedroom, saying grumpily, \u201cHey, I got something to talk to you.\u201dLou Yu gave Mo Fei a look and asked, \u201cWhat is it? Shoot!\u201dAfter thinking for a bit, Mo Fei said, \u201cI will participate in not only the talent competition but also the potions contest.\u201dLou Yu then opened his eyes and looked at Mo Fei questioningly, \u201cYou are really a busy body!\u201d\u201cAble men are always busy, you know?\u201d Mo Fei raised his chin and said to Lou Yu proudly.Lou Yu smiled brightly, \u201cSure. But what I don\u2019t know is that you could be rendered as an able man.\u201dMo Fei grinded his teeth, \u201cThere\u2019re so many things out there you don\u2019t know.\u201dLou Yu then gave him a sneer, \u201cAre you trying to tell me you also plan to join the Top 100 Championship?\u201dMo Fei gave him a hollow laugh, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI totally agree, because you\u2019d only get a beating there, I mean a good one and you\u2019d end up looking for your teeth everywhere.\u201d ridiculed Lou Yu.Mo Fei took a deep breath and told himself to calm down in his heart, \u201cI\u2019m gonna build a secret potions room.\u201dAfter looking at Mo Fei for quite some time, Lou Yu sighed, \u201cCome with me.\u201d\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d asked Mo Fei, confused.Lou Yu pressed a button inside the wardrobe and it slowly moved away, then a pint-sized elevator showed up in front.Mo Fei followed Mo Fei into the elevator and it didn\u2019t stop after quite a while.Mo Fei then walked out of the elevator behind Lou Yu and soon a luxurious underground potion room unfolded before Mo Fei\u2019s eyes.The potion room was placed with all kinds of precise tubes and all kinds of advanced apparatuses. And on the shelves beside, there were a lot of precious potion materials.Mo Fei surprisingly looked at the potion room, jaws dropped, \u201cThis potion room must have a long history, I guess.\u201dLou Yu nodded, saying with a complicated expression, \u201cYeah, three years.\u201dMo Fei turned to Lou Yu and said, \u201cI assume you don\u2019t know about potions.\u201dLou Yu nodded and answered honestly, \u201cNot really.\u201dMo Fei looked at Lou Yu, \u201cYou don\u2019t know about potions, then why did you build such a huge potion room?\u201dLou Yu looked away, some kind of embarrassing feeling crawling onto his face.Mo Fei immediately understood, \u201cSo this has been built for Lin Feiyu.\u201dLou Yu closed his eyes and said slowly and emotionally, \u201cI thought I\u2019d be with him for the rest of my life. But plans can never pace with changes.\u201dThen Mo Fei said thoughtfully, \u201cThree years ago, you were only 15 years old and you already wanted to grow old with him? No wonder you got dumped! History tells me that early love would come to no good.\u201dLou Yu glared at Mo Fei, \u201cBefore he met Lou Yu, Feiyu was all good.\u201dMo Fei nodded and touched his chin, \u201cI heard you were childhood friends. Maybe because you\u2019ve known each other for too long, so you know, seven-year itch.\u201dLou Yu took a deep breath and said, \u201cMaybe, but it\u2019s no use to talk about it now.\u201d\u201cSo this potion room is offered to me now?\u201d asked Mo Fei.Lou Yu nodded, \u201cSure!\u201d\u201cGood, good. This place is really not bad.\u201d said Mo Fei with emotion.Lou Yu looked at Mo Fei and asked, \u201cWon\u2019t you even say thank you?\u201dMo Fei raised his eyebrows, \u201cThank you? It\u2019s a total waste if you don\u2019t use it? Now I\u2019m helping you utilize some waste materials? Shouldn\u2019t you thank me instead?\u201dLou Yu, \u201c\u2026\u201d Mo Fei the asshole!Mo Fei looked at Lou Yu and said with great interest, \u201cSo you are gonna take part in the Top 100 Championship, right?\u201dLou Yu nodded, \u201cYeah.\u201dMo Fei looked at Lou Yu and said, \u201cGiven your ability, you will make a clean sweep, won\u2019t you?\u201dLou Yu frowned, \u201cThose students from senior grades will also join in. Facing those people, I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t have any advantage.\u201dMo Fei nodded approvingly and said earnestly, \u201cThen be careful. Don\u2019t get a too tough beating that even your mother couldn\u2019t recognize you!\u201dLou Yu took a glance at Mo Fei, \u201cYou\u2019d better worry about yourself.

Of course, some also haven\u2019t made any preparation, but they have the confidence and could perform at any time.

    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95: Unavoidable Confrontation (1)Translator: Guy Gone Bad\u201cYoung master, you are looking for me?\u201d asked Mo Yi while walking out of the bedroom.Mo Fei nodded, \u201cYeah! I just got to know the preliminary contest will be held three days later. Let\u2019s go pick the instrument for me today.\u201dMo Fei immediately agreed readily, \u201cOK, no problem.\u201dSu Rong cast a glance at Mo Yi and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cMo Yi, Top 100 Championship is much more important than the talent competition and would attract more attention. I suggest you should take your time to practice.\u201dMo Yi gave Su Rong a side look and said disapprovingly, \u201cTop 100 Championship is not important to me. I won\u2019t put in on my mind.\u201dSu Rong was a little anxious, saying with his face reddened, \u201cHow could you not put such an important competition on your mind?\u201dHands on his hips, Mo Fei looked at Mo Fei disapprovingly, \u201cRongrong, don\u2019t you worry. Even if my sweet Yiyi doesn\u2019t practice, he could still give you a so damn good beat that you even couldn\u2019t get up from the ground.\u201dSu Rong: \"...\" This son of bitch! How could he belittle me? Anyway I am also a talent!Seeing Su Rong was kind of depressed, Mo Fei patted on his shoulder and tried to comfort him, \u201cDon\u2019t lose heart. Practice makes perfect. As long as you try hard, you still have a chance to catch up with my Yiyi.\u201d Mo Fei then looked over to Mo Yi, \u201cYiyi, with such superb aptitude and you still work so hard, how could others catch up with you?\u201dMo Yu put on a shallow smile and said, \u201cSo I can only not work so hard and give someone else a little ray of hope.\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dThen Mo Fei went out of Prince Yu Mansion with Mo Fei under Su Rong\u2019s resentful eyes.After getting out of the mansion, Mo Fei and Mo Yi came to the biggest musical instrument shop Paradise on Earth throughout the imperial city.\"My dear crown princess, you really come to the right place if you want to choose some superb musical instrument! We have anything you want here, with great quality. Whatever kind of musical instrument you want, I can find it for you. The talent competition is starting soon. Most of those participants have bought their musical instrument in our shop.\u201d The chubby shop owner said with all smiles.Mo Fei looked at the large musical instrument shop, nodded his head in satisfaction and said, \"This place looks good, very good.\"Mo Yi leaned close to Mo Fei\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cYoung master, is it because you saw the poster at the door are all beautiful and sexy women so you said very good?\u201dMo Fei's face turned slightly red, \u201cYiyi, in this world you are the only who knows about me! How can I not love you!!!\u201dMo Yi rolled his eyes at him. He knew he would say this!Then Mo Fei saw that there was a piano in the middle of the hall, his eyes were beaming, \u201cThis piano looks not bad. Let me have a try.\u201d\"Lord Mo Fei, you really have a good taste. This piano has a great appearance, has superb tunes, and also quite steady. It is the eye of our shop!\u201d said the shopkeeper, still with all smiles.Mo Fei pursed his lips, thinking to himself, \u201cWhen he that seven-string harp, I remember the shopkeeper also said it\u2019s the eye of his shop. And that violin, and\u2026This shop really has a lot of eyes of the shop!\u201dMo Yi just wandered in the shop, and suddenly he got attracted by a jade flute. The moment Mo Yi\u2019s hand fell on it, another hand also fell on it at the same time.Both sides turned their heads at each other. And when the two pairs of eyes looked into each other, both of them frowned.Mo Yi: \"boss, I want this jade flute.\u201dZheng Xuan, \u201cBoss, I'll take this jade flute.\"On hearing both of them calling him at the same time, the fat shopkeeper hurriedly moved to them. Sensing the tense air here, the fat shopkeeper\u2019s heart skipped a beat, and he immediately wore an embarrassing face.\"Boss, how much is that jade flute? We want it.\u201d Seeing it was Zheng Xuan who was fighting for the flute with Mo Yi, Mo Fei immediately got on fire and tried to start this war!\"Boss, how much is this jade flute? Just name a price. \"Zheng Xuan was also unwilling to be outdone.\"You think you're the only one with money, boss just name a price and we are gonna pay.\" Said Mo Fei with his eyes narrowed.The fat shopkeeper wiped off the cold sweat on his forehead. The three of them really gave him a headache. One side was the third Crown Princess, while the other side was General Zheng\u2019s grandson.

If you want it, it can give you twenty percent off. But the thing is there is only one here, so you two\u2026\u201d\u201cI saw it first, you let it go.\u201d said Mo Yi while glaring at Zheng Xuan coldly.\u201cBullshit! I saw it first!\u201d said Zheng Xuan disapprovingly.Mo Yi sneered, \u201cAre you trying to pick a fight?\u201dZheng Xuan gave it a thought and said, \u201cWhat about we have a fight here?\u201dMo Yi gave Zheng Xuan a sarcastic look, \u201cYou are at level five while I am only at level four. You fight me? You are really shameless! Oh, I remember. You have always been so shameless to fight those whose levels are lower than you. You are such a bully!\u201dZheng Xuan\u2019s face reddened a bit and then he said, \u201cI will lower my ability to level four to fight you.\u201dMo Fei then gave Mo Yi a wink, and Mo Yi immediately grabbed Zheng Xuan\u2019s arm and bit fiercely.\u201cAh!\u201d Zheng Xuan made a screech and then let go of the flute.Mo Yi seized the opportunity and grabbed the jade flute and threw it into his Space Ring.Mo Yi showed no mercy with his mouth, fast, accurately and also ferociously. And a tooth print as deep as to the bone was left on Zheng Xuan\u2019s arm.Zheng Xuan looked at Mo Yi resentfully, while Mo Yi gave him a triumphant smile.Mo Fei said cockily, \u201cAll right. Now you lose. The flute is ours.\u201dLooking at the tooth print on his hand, Zheng Xuan glared at Mo Yi, \u201cYou cheated.\u201d\u201cYoung man, you call taking the initiative cheating? Come on! Don\u2019t be ridiculous! Young man, you still have a long way to go. This world is not so simple as you imagined.\u201d sneered Mo Fei.Zheng Xuan looked at Mo Fei, gritting his teeth, with raging fire in his eyes.Zheng Xuan turned his eyes to Mo Yi, \u201cMo Yi, if you are a man of your word, have a real fight with me!\u201dMo Yi looked at Zheng Xuan ironically, and snorted, \u201cWho would fight with you? You really should have a thorough bath. You stink! I nearly threw up when I bit you.\u201dZheng Xuan gave Mo Yi a filthy look while Mo Yi wiped his mouth and just ignored him.Zheng Xuan\u2019s face was pitch-black and nearly blacked out.The shopkeeper wiped the cold sweat off his head, looked at Mo Fei and Mo Yi with reverence, and then took a look at Zheng Xuan with sympathy.General Zheng Mansion\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d asked Zheng Hong while looking at Zheng Xuan who was wearing a gloomy face.Zheng Xuan said impatiently with that long face, \u201cI went to the instrument shop Paradise on Earth.\u201dZheng Hong\u2019s eyes then settled on Zheng Xuan\u2019s arm, \u201cYou have a fight in the instrument shop?\u201d\u201cSort of.\u201d Zheng Xuan grinded his teeth. Before he launched a move, the other party already pounced at him to bite. Damn it! Anyhow Mo Yi was a level four star magician! How could he bite him so shamelessly? And so sharply? And even said he stunk???Zheng Hong snorted, \u201cIt looks like you are the one who took a loss.\u201dZheng Xuan pursed his lips and nodded.Zheng Hong then snorted coldly, \u201cTop 100 Championship is around the corner and you still have time to go to the instrument shop? You are so idle!\u201dZheng Xuan peeped at Zheng Hong impatiently, \u201cI will try my best to cultivate. Grandpa, if there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll go back to cultivate now.\u201dZheng Hong knew he didn\u2019t want to talk now, so he shook his hand and said, \u201cOff you go.\u201dWith Zheng Hong\u2019s approving, Zheng Xuan immediately went to his own room.\u201cYoung master, what is wrong with your arm? Let me apply some medicine for you.\u201d cried Zheng Shi when he came out of the room and saw Zheng Xuan\u2019s wound.Zheng Xuan clenched his fists and said while looking at the wound on his hand, \u201cNo need. I will keep this.\u201dZheng Shi scratched his head, \u201cI know, young master. It should be left by Lord Xu. So you want to keep it?\u201dZheng Xuan immediately flew into anger, \u201cHow would it be Zihan? Do you think Zihan would bite me so hard?\u201dZheng Shi then said with a confusing tone, \u201cSince it\u2019s not Lord Xu, why would you keep it anyway?\u201dZheng Xuan said grumpily, \u201cI just want to keep it to remind me of the shame today.\u201dZheng Shi then nodded, \u201cYoung master, then who left it if I may ask?\u201dZheng Xuan grinded his teeth, \u201cIt\u2019s Mo Yi.\u201dZheng Shi popped out his eyes and said excitedly, \u201cYou mean that guy who released the bees to sting you?\u201dZheng Xuan looked at Zheng Shi and narrowed his eyes, \u201cJudging from your tone, you really adore him, don\u2019t you?\u201dZheng Shi smiled awkwardly, \u201cHow is it possible? I just think this guy is\u2026gross.\u201dZheng Xuan waved his hand, \u201cYou can go.\u201dZheng Xuan touched the tooth print and had kind of weird feeling on thinking of Mo Yi\u2019s face.Zheng Xuan gritted his teeth thinking that he had felt a resonance with Mo Yi.

There\u2019s a fight! Come on guys\u2026Let\u2019s go\u2026\u201dThe moment they entered the campus, Mo Fei and Mo Yi saw a beehive of students rushing towards the challenge ring.They rushed toward the challenging ring like a gust of strong wind passing through Mo Fei and Mo Yi.Mo Fei frowned, and said in dissatisfaction, \u201cOh come on! What\u2019s so fun watching someone fighting? Why is everybody so excited?\u201dMo Yi shrugged helplessly and said, \u201cThe Top 100 Championship is coming soon. Everyone seems to have their blood boiling!\u201dMo Fei nodded his head, \u201cIt seems so!\u201dMo Yi and Mo Fei were fixed by a pair of hatred-filled eyes as soon as they entered the classroom. Mo Fei picked his eyebrows, smiled calmly and walked towards his seat.Xu Zihan\u2019s stare was like to skin him alive, but Mo Yi just ignored it and came to his seat.After he sat down in his seat, Yan Chen leaned in and said admiringly, \u201cMo Fei, you will take part in the talent competition, right?\u201dHe nodded, \u201cYes!\u201dYan Chen looked at Mo Fei with bright eyes and said, \u201cMo Fei, you are awesome! By the way, Xu Zihan will also participate.\u201dThe talent show was limited in participants\u2019 quota. When selecting candidates, the teachers would consider not only the students\u2019 abilities but also their background. Xu Zihan\u2019 got Zheng Xuan behind his back. So it was reasonable for him to be selected.Mo Fei sneered, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect him to get recovered and climb out of his bed so soon. Didn\u2019t they say he was half dead from bee stings? I knew it was a rumor.\u201dYan Chen puffed his cheeks, \u201cI heard he was seriously injured, but Zheng Xuan spent a lot of money to buy a recovery potion from the level six potion master Yan Wei\u2019an. With that potion, he got healed very quickly.\u201d\u201cWell. Zheng Xuan is really love fool.\u201d Mo Fei said in a casual tone.Yan Chen nodded and said, \u201cYes! Zheng Xuan is famous for his infatuation for his lover. By the way, Xu Zihan said that he would beat you into a bloody pulp in the talent competition.\u201dMo Fei smiled contemptuously, his eyes flashed a stern look, \u201cReally? Then I would like to see if he really has the ability.\u201dLin Feiyu gave Mo Fei a thoughtful look, with a trace of fear in his eyes.Shangguan Tianxing looked at Lin Feiyu, \u201cFeiyu, what are you going to perform this time?\u201dLin Feiyu smiled and said with a faint smile, \u201cI do not have much talent, so I intend to sing a song.\u201dShangguan Tianxing was sort of surprised, \u201cReally? What a surprise! I thought you would play the piano.\u201dLin Feiyu smiled faintly, and his heart tightened. Without Mo Fei, he would certainly have chosen to play the piano.He had always enjoyed the reputation as the piano prince. It was not until on the wedding of Lou Yu that Lin Feiyu discovered that his piano skills were far from good after Mo Fei amazed the audience with a pianolude. Lin Feiyu was not sure about Mo Fei\u2019s performance so he did not dare to choose the piano.Lin Feiyu frowned and said, \u201cI don\u2019t really feeling like playing the piano recently.\u201dShangguan Tianxing smiled and said happily, \u201cSince you chose not to play the piano, I will be relieved to perform the piano.\u201dLin Feiyu smiled reluctantly.Mo Fei rolled his eyes. The participants from the Elite Class to take part in the talent competition were not less compared with other classes, but the quota was still not enough. Apart from Mo Fei, Lin Feiyu, Xu Zihan, and Shangguan Tianxing, the first beauty in the class, Ling Shanshan, was also selected.The atmosphere in the class looked calm on the surface, but the inside was choppy. All the selected candidates were trying their best to make a blockbuster.Mo Fei was holding his chin up. He had a perfunctory attitude towards the talent competition, but since someone wanted to snap him into the mud, he had to fight back with extra spirit.Mo Yi and Mo Fei went back to Prince Yu Mansion and saw Su Rong, who was beaten black and blue.Mo Fei was surprised, jaws dropped, gloating, \u201cOh, my great Talent Su! How did you get beaten up like this?\u201dAs he saw Mo Fei, Su Rong\u2019s face went stiff.\u201cWhat guilty things have you done? Did you rob somebody else\u2019s wife and get beaten by her husband?\u201d Mo Fei elbowed Su Rong, full of curiosity.\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d Su Rong was so agitated that the wound on his face expanded and he immediately felt great pain.Mo Fei sneered, \u201cThen, what was going wrong?\u201d\u201cThe quota for the Top 100 Championship is limited. Players who have not won the quota can replace those who have won the quota through fair and square challenges and win the competition cards of their opponents.\u201d Su Rong said in the grievance.Mo Fei opened his eyes wide and said, \u201cJudging from your appearance, your card has been robbed, right?\u201dSu Rong looked away and said, \u201cNo, my opponent is hurt much more serious than I am.\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s strange that you got hurt so badly without your card being robbed?\u201d said Mo Fei with a surprising tone.Su Rong said in a muffled voice, \u201cOne person can join at most one challenge a day. Even if his second challenge succeeds, it is useless.\u201dMo Fei thought for a while and said, \u201cIt seems Yiyi also got a card, but no one has ever challenged him.\u201dSu Rong frowned, \u201cMany people saw Mo Yi and Zheng Xuan\u2019s fight that day. Mo Yi has promoted to a higher level again. Everyone knows that Yiyi was a tough one and no one dares to challenge him for the time being.\u201d How miserably Xu Zihan was bitten that day! Mo Yi even dared to challenge Zheng Xuan. Who would have the guts to fight with him?Those who were really powerful had got the challenge cards. Those who were average in strength were mostly level-three star magician. Most of these people would choose those of the same level to challenge.Mo Fei nodded as if he understood something, \u201cIt makes sense. Yiyi is so strong, those who want to challenge him are looking for self-abusing. But you are different. Now everyone wants to challenge you. You are very popular! Su Rong, you can do this! You let them bid, and you fight with the highest bidder, so you lose, you still have some income!\u201d\u82cf\u8363\uff1a\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dSu Rong gave him a glare and said with some dissatisfaction, \u201cLord Mo Fei, can you not be so gloating?\u201dMo Fei smiled shyly and said like a badass, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, but I just can\u2019t help. My biggest hobby is to watch you arrogant guys have bad luck and get your asses kicked.\u201dSu Rong said with some grievance, \u201cI\u2019m not arrogant.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cYeah! You\u2019re not. But you follow behind an arrogant man every day!\u201dSu Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Yi cleared his throat. Then Mo Fei raised his head and looked upstairs. Lou Yu was wearing a cold face and his eyes were full of murderous look.Mo Fei felt a headache and scratched his head. Why was he always heard by the parties concerned when he spoke ill of others behind their backs? He was really in his bad luck recently!Lou Yu walked down the stairs step by step, while Mo Fei rubbed his fingers, revealing a face full of innocence.\u201cYou will have your preliminaries tomorrow, right?\u201d Lou Yu asked.Mo Fei nodded, \u201cYes!\u201dLou Yu looked at him with disdain, \u201cAre you all prepared? Don\u2019t be eliminated in the first round. Of course, if you are eliminated in the first round, don\u2019t feel too depressed, you don\u2019t have to to continue to humiliate yourself on stage then, do you?\u201dMo Fei, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe took a deep breath and stared at Lou Yu, \u201cThere is no need for you to worry about my competition.\u201dLou Yu nodded and said, \u201cI have nothing to worry about. You\u2019re the one who is going to lose your face.\u201dLooking at the back of Lou Yu, Mo Fei clenched his fists angrily, \u201cYou son of a bicth!\u201d\u201cLord MoFei.\u201d Su Rong called him with some hesitation.Mo Fei then turned to Su Rong, \u201cUh-huh? What\u2019s up?\u201dSu Rong asked tentatively while looking at him, \u201cYour Highness, do you have any potion that could heal the wounds quickly?\u201dSu Rong couldn\u2019t help getting nervous. He was seriously injured and couldn\u2019t recover in a day. At this rate, he would surely lose if someone challenged him again tomorrow.On that day, Su Rong caught a glimpse and vaguely saw Mo Fei had given Mo Yi a bottle of blue potion. The smell overflowing from the bottle mouth made people feel all at ease.Mo Fei looked at Su Rong with his chin cupped and said lightly, \u201cYes!\u201dSu Rong said while looking at Mo Fei nervously, \u201cLord Mo Fei, can you sell me one?\u201dMo Fei looked at Su Rong with picky eyes, \u201cSell you one? Do you have enough star coins?\u201dSu Rong scratched his head and said, \u201cCan I write an IOU? I will definitely pay you back by hook and crook, my lord.\u201dMo Fei smiled and remained silent.Su Rong gritted his teeth and looked at Mo Fei prayerfully, \u201cLord Mo Fei, as long as you give me that potion, I\u2019d like to be your slave. I\u2019ll do whatever you ask me to.\u201dMo Fei cocked his head, looked at Su Rong in wonder, and asked excitedly, \u201cDo whatever I say? You sure?\u201dSu Rong nodded sincerely.\u201cThen I\u2019ll let you beat Lou Yu,\u201d Mo Fei said, blinking his eyes.Su Rong was somewhat embarrassed, \u201cI am no match for the prince.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll let you drug him.\u201d Mo Fei continued.Su Rong felt more embarrassed, \u201cI dare not.\u201dMo Fei sipped his lips and looked at Su Rong, full of sarcasm, \u201cSo this is your promise to be slave for me?\u201dSu Rong felt awkward, \u201cI will listen to you on matters that have nothing to do with the prince.\u201dMo Fei rather inquisitively looked at Su Rong, \u201cMatters that have nothing to do with Prince Yu? Is it because you like him?\u201dSu Rong looked at Mo Fei in utter amazement, a face of panic, \u201cLord Mo Fei, what makes you think it that way? Even if I have the courage, I will not dare to steal anyone from you!\u201dMo Fei looked at Su Rong\u2019s appearance and smiled amusingly, \u201cWhy are you scared like this, as if I were a scourge or what\u2026\u201dSu Rong bowed his head and thought to himself: You were more horrible than a scourge.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There are so many people taking part in the preliminaries that we couldn\u2019t arrange a backstage for each of you, sorry we could only put the four boys in your class together.\u201d Fang Cheng explained.Mo Fei smiled reluctantly, \u201cThank you, sir.\u201dFang Cheng nodded, \u201cGo backstage to the backstage yourself. I still got tones of work to do.\u201d\u201cSee you, sir,\u201d Mo Fei watched Fang Cheng go away, feeling headaches and holding his forehead: Fang Cheng, this guy actually put him, Lin Feiyu and Xu Zihan in the same room. Isn;t he afraid of their four jumpy young men would tear down the house?Mo Fei walked into the room and found the other three were already there.The room allocated by the college to them was not small, but the people who cooperated with the contestants and the people who came to visit them were also in the room, which made it somewhat crowded.Xu Zihan\u2019s eyes showed with a thick disgust seeing Mo Fei and Mo Yi come in.While Zheng Xuan showed reluctance in his eyes with Mo Yi\u2019s coming in.\u201cMo Yi, you robbed the flute that my Xuan wanted to send me.\u201d Xu Zihan snapped.Mo Yi looked at Xu Zihan lazily and asked coldly, \u201cDidn\u2019t your Xuan tell you that he was too weak to keep his flute and that was the why the flute fell into my hands?\u201dXu Zihan glared at him and said, \u201cThat\u2019s because you guys cheated and bit him!\u201dMo Yi raised his head, his eyes crossing over Xu Zihan, looked over to Zheng Xuan, and asked in a light tone, \u201cDid you take a bath today?\u201dZheng Xuan\u2019s face looked gloomy, and his knuckles burst into crisp sound.Mo Yi narrowed his eyes and looked at Zheng Xuan coldly. The atmosphere in the room suddenly became tense.\u201cWell, Mo Fei, you haven\u2019t changed your performance clothes! Do it quickly,\u201d Shangguan Tianxing came out to break the embarrassing and icy atmosphere.Mo Fei nodded, \u201cAll right!\u201dMo Fei went into the dressing room and changed a blue shirt. What he wanted to perform was the ancient zither, and he specially chose ancient-style clothes to match the instrument, with a green jade hairpin on his hair, which looked somewhat sage-like.Shangguan Tianxing looked at Mo Fei coming out and got a little amazed, \u201cMo Fei, you look amazing in this dress.\u201dMo Fei was holding the ancient zither, he looked like a gentlemen, modest and self-disciplined. Shangguan Tianxing suddenly felt Mo Fei was like a figure walking out of a picture.Mo Fei smiled shyly and said, \u201cWell, Shangguan, you\u2019re flattering me.\u201d\u201cMo Fei, you are truly beautiful, my third brother is really blessed!\u201d Lou Feng said.Mo Fei raised his head and saw the speaker who was standing beside Lin Feiyu, paused, he had just focused on his opponent Xu Zihan, but didn\u2019t notice Lou Feng was also here.\u201cBrother, thank you for your compliment.\u201d Mo Fei was kind of embarrassed.Realizing Lin Feiyu\u2019s popularity, Lin Feiyu\u2019s eyes revealed trace of dark color.Zheng Xuan frowned and looked at Xu Zihan in his dancing clothes and asked, \u201cAre you going to perform dancing today? Didn\u2019t you say you wanted to play the flute?\u201dXu Zihan said casually, \u201cPlaying flute is boring. It\u2019s better to dance. I\u2019ve been preparing it for a long time. Don\u2019t you like my dancing?\u201dZheng Xuan shook his head and said, \u201cOf course I like it. I like everything you do.\u201dXu Zihan chuckled brightly at Zheng Xuan, \u201cI knew you would like it.\u201dZheng Xuan smiled, combing Xu Zihan\u2019s hair with tenderness, and there was a untraceable faint disappointment flashing in his eyes.Xu Zihan lowered his head, with a shy smile on his face, and did not notice Zheng Xuan\u2019s loss deep in his eyes.Mo Yi came out of the dressing room in total white. He also had a hair clasp on his head, which was made of white jade.Zheng Xuan paused at the sight of Mo Yi. Mo Yi was dressed in white like a sage floating out of the mortal life and living in a forbidden world. Zheng Xuan could hardly connect this beautiful man with the brutal guy who bit him rudely that day.Xu Zihan looked at Zheng Xuan, and hit him with his elbow discontentedly, \u201cWhat? Are you stunned?\u201dZheng Xuan was embarrassed, \u201cNo.\u201dMo Yi picked his eyebrows with no emotions.Mo Fei cupped his chin, sized Mo Yi up and down and then said, \u201cYiyi, your figure is really suitable for dancing! Are you really not going to be my dancing partner?\u201dMo Yi glanced at Mo Fei lightly, his eyebrows locked and said, \u201cYoung master, you remember our agreement? I will play the flute to cooperate with you.\u201dMo Fei shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cI just feel a little pity. Your beautiful dance will definitely overthrow the cities and ruin the states.\u201dMo Yi gave him a glare, \u201cI\u2019m flattered, young master. I do not have that charm.\u201d\u201cMo Fei, where is your Prince Yu?\u201d Xu Zihan looked at Mo Fei cynically.Mo Fei frowned. Now he only found that in addition to him, the lovers of the other three guys were all present.\u201cHe is busy!\u201d Mo Fei replied in a casual way.Xu Zihan snorted coldly, \u201cThe third prince is too cold to you. He don\u2019t even come and see you on such a big occasion!\u201dMo Fei glanced at Xu Zihan, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201dLou Feng looked at Mo Fei with a smile, \u201cMy third younger brother is really lucky to be married to such a beautiful man like you, but it seems that he himself do not know about his luck.\u201dAccompanied by Lou Feng\u2019s words, the backstage door was pushed open.If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When Lou Feng realized Lou Yu didn\u2019t put him in his eyes at all, his face became gloomy.While Mo Fei bore a kind of unspeakable taste in his heart when he saw this man come in.\u201cYou are here.\u201d Mo Fei\u2019s voice sounded unnatural.Lou Yu looked at Mo Fei up and down and then said, \u201cYou look like a human in this suit.\u201dMo Fei forced a smile and said plaintively, \u201cMy prince, you\u2019d better find time to learn more words of praise, you always praise me the same way like that, I\u2019m tired of listening.\u201dLou Yu curled his lip and said disapprovingly, \u201cYou should be grateful since I already would love to use some complimenting words on you.\u201dMo Fei: \u201c\u2026\u201d You Yu, you son of a bitch!\u201cThen I really should thank you for your compliment!\u201d Mo Fei said snappily.\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Lou Yu said generously.Mo Fei showed a beautiful smile, saying with a tone full of concern, \u201cMy prince, be careful when you fight with others. Arms and legs injuries are trivial matter. Be careful not to be stabbed in the stomach.\u201dLou Yu revealed a brilliant smile with a mouthful of white teeth, \u201cYou worry too much. If you go on stage to compete, you will definitely be poked into a sieve, but this kind of thing will not happen to me.\u201dMo Fei nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right, oh, I just remembered. You have thick skin, so you are invulnerable and will never be stabbed through.\u201dLou Yu looked at Mo Fei with gnashing teeth, \u201cThank you for your words.\u201dShangguan Tianxing couldn\u2019t help but poof a loud laugh. Seeing that those people were looking at him, he felt pretty embarrassed and said, \u201cMy prince, you two are really on intimate terms.\u201dMo Fei gave him a hollow laugh, \u201cYes, yes! We are especially intimate.\u201dLou Yu suddenly held Mo Fei\u2019s shoulder tightly. Mo Fei staggered under his arm. \u201cYes, everyone can see that we\u2019re intimate.\u201dAt this time Fang Cheng came in, looking discontented, and said, \u201cDo you have any idea what time is it?

It will be your turn in a moment.\u201dXu Zihan, Mo Fei and others all nodded solemnly toward Fang Cheng.Fang Cheng looked at the Prince Feng and said, \u201cNon-contestants leave the arena and wait in the audience. Don\u2019t stay here and affect the performance of the contestants.\u201dHearing Fang Cheng\u2019s words, Lou Feng and others backed out in turn.The backstage became much quieter and emptier with fewer people.Lin Feiyu lowered his head, his eyes flashed with hatred. After Lou Yu entered this door, he didn\u2019t even take a look at him. Lin Feiyu gnashed his teeth, a twinge of sour feeling surged in his heart.Xu Zihan looked at Mo Fei\u2019s instrument and his eyes narrowed slightly, \u201cMo Fei, do you want to play this?\u201dMo Fei nodded and said, \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cThis is some rare talent. Players would not be able to grasp it without years of practice and they won\u2019t be judged if they play it well. I\u2019m just afraid that someone would give a bad show and play to the gallery!\u201d Xu Zihan said in a cold tone.Mo Fei held his chin up and said, \u201cXu Zihan, the dancing partner you invited seems like a somebody. Well, is he a member of the band Dead Crow?\u201dMo Yi turned over his supercilious look and said, \u201cYoung master, it\u2019s not Dead Crow, it\u2019s a Black Crow.\u201d\u201cOh, I see. I made a mistake. I have been wondering who would call themselves Dead Crow.\u201dShangguan Tianxing corrected them with a tone of resignation, \u201cIt\u2019s neither Dead Crow nor Black Crow, but Black Duck.\u201dMo Fei then said like he was suddenly enlightened, \u201cWell ,so it\u2019s Black Duck, Shangguan, you have a good memory. Yiyi, you see, you were also wrong. Xu Zihan, you must give us excellent performance, otherwise, the audiences will all focus on the Black Duck instead of you.\u201dXu Zihan gritted his teeth and stared at Mo Fei, \u201cYou\u2019d better worry about yourself.\u201dAlthough Xu Zihan was proud, he still had self-knowledge. He knew that it was difficult to stand out with his strength. Therefore, he invited the Black Duck as his support. This kind of thing was very common in a talent show, but he did not expect it to be used as a gossip.Shangguan Tianxing looked at the two and felt helplessly, \u201cAll right, you should stop. We should get along well with each other.\u201dMo Fei looked at Shangguan Tianxing piously and said, \u201cYoung master, you know I am friendly the best. Everyone says I am the messenger of peace. However, some people always like to find my trouble. God said that when someone hits you with a fist, you must return them ten fists. In this way, they will not dare to bully you.\u201dShangguan Tianxing questioned with amazement, \u201cWhich god said this?\u201dMo Fei smiled with embarrassment and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know which god said it, but there are so many gods in this world, there will always be one who has said this.\u201dShangguan Tianxing was tongue-tied: Which god would talk about this nonsense?\u201dMo Yi leaned into Mo Fei\u2019s ear and asked, \u201cYoung master, did you just make it up?\u201dMo Fei twitched his lip, \u201cJust know it in the heart. You don\u2019t need to say it out.\u201dShangguan Tianxing, \u2018\u2026\u201dIf you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
