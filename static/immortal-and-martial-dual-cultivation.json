When he purchased the Compendium of Cultivation on Taobao, the seller had included this for free.That Taobao shop seemed to be a little dumb. After he bought the Compendium of Cultivation for 250 RMB, they had actually given him an Immortal Pill that was said to allow one to ascend to a higher plane.Xiao Chen was usually very interested in immortal cultivation and the legends attached to it; thus, without having to consider it too much, he made the purchase.For three years, Xiao Chen cultivated according to the methods outlined in the Compendium of Cultivation. He had cultivated for a whole three years, but there had not been a shred of improvement. Aside from remembering the methods of refining pills, making talismans, formations, and refining weapons, he was not able to make sense of the rest.However, Xiao Chen did not give up; he placed his hopes on that Immortal Pill, despite it seeming strange beyond compare.He once tried to use a steel hammer to smash it. When the steel hammer approached the Immortal Pill, it seemed to have a force field around it. No matter how much strength he used, the steel hammer was not able to get near it.The mystical immortal destiny of legend could be hidden within this Immortal Pill. Xiao Chen hesitated, as this Immortal Pill seemed very strange. It would be fine if he ate it and nothing happened, but what if something happened and he turned into a monster \u2013 what would he do then?This was why he did not dare to eat the Immortal Pill until now.Eat? Or not to eat?Eat!Xiao Chen steeled his heart and made his decision; he decided to eat this Immortal Pill, for it was either make or break. There was no such thing as a free lunch in this world. It was not possible to have any rewards without risk.Xiao Chen pinched his nose, shut his eyes, placed the Immortal Pill in his mouth, and swallowed it. Xiao Chen could obviously feel that the Immortal Pill sank down till it arrived in the area where the Dantian was located. The Dantian suffused its surroundings with warmth, and the Qi and blood in his body seemed to converge into his soul.Xiao Chen could only feel that his mouth was dry and his head was dizzy, as though his soul was forcibly syphoned out. His consciousness clouded up, and slowly... he became unaware.[TL notes: Taobao is like ebay but chinese version]Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a fine sunny day with a clear sky, but Xiao Chen\u2019s mood was extremely bad, and he was feeling very depressed.He swore that if he ever returned to Earth, he would never buy anything from Taobao anymore.When he had purchased the Compendium of Cultivation for 250 RMB, the seller had also included an Immortal Pill that was said to be able to allow someone to ascend to the world of Immortals.Xiao Chen was normally very interested in the legends and cultivation methods of immortals and had purchased it at the drop of a hat.For three years, Xiao Chen had followed the cultivation methods written in the Compendium of Cultivation, but there had been no progress at all. Aside from remembering the methods of refining pills, making talismans, formations, and weapons refining, he was not able to make sense of the rest.However, Xiao Chen did not give up, placing his hopes on the Immortal Pill, a dark-green pill that seemed strange beyond compare.He once tried to use a steel hammer to smash it, which revealed a force field around it as the hammer got close. Regardless of how much weight he put into his swings, the force field wouldn\u2019t budge.This mysterious occurrence caused Xiao Chen to make a decision and finally eat this Immortal Pill.Who could have expected that after he ate the Immortal Pill, albeit indeed ascending to a different world, it was not the Immortal World of\u00a0legend\u00a0but rather a place known as the Tianwu Continent.He was muddleheaded for a long time before he realized that he had crossed over and possessed a person with the same name, Xiao Chen, as himself.He would have been able to endure it if it were a regular ascension, but whom among the ascended did not end up being competent and arrogant, capable of singlehandedly defeating countless experts with their bare hands and sending crowds of beauties into screaming delirium with the wave of their hand?The Tianwu continent was a realm where the strong were respected. However, the person whose body he possessed was absolute trash in the way of cultivation. He was already sixteen years old, yet he still had not condensed his Martial Spirit.The Xiao Clan was the number one clan in Mohe City, and Xiao Chen was the son of the clan head. It may sound very prestigious, but because of his lack of talent in cultivation, even the servants in his clan looked down on him. Xiao Chen\u2019s reputation of being trash was known by everyone in all of Mohe City, causing him to be despised by everyone, even when he went outside.\u201cYoung Master Xiao, the first elder has asked for you to go to the martial hall to test your abilities. If you have nothing to do, then you should quickly go. I have already passed on the message, so whether you go or not is your problem.\u201dWhen he heard that voice, it promptly broke Xiao Chen\u2019s train of thought. The person who spoke was a servant girl of the Xiao Clan. However, she did not even bother to look at Xiao Chen, who was sitting on the roof of the house. When she finished saying her piece, she casually ignored Xiao Chen and left.The servants of the Xiao Clan were people who could cultivate. The aptitudes of the servant girl who spoke earlier were not high, but she had successfully condensed her Martial Spirit when she was twelve years old. She was stronger than Xiao Chen, the trash who could not condense a Martial Spirit, even when he was already sixteen years old. Furthermore, Xiao Chen would normally rely on his status and flirted with these servant girls, which had tarnished his reputation, so how could anyone possibly end up respecting him?\u201cEven a servant girl dares to despise him... what in the world did this Xiao Chen do?\u201d After the servant girl had relayed her message, his mood worsened. He patted his butt clear of dust and then directly jumped off the roof.What caused Xiao Chen\u2019s mood to turn sour was not the attitude of the servant girl, but rather it was the message that the servant girl passed on to him. The Xiao Clan\u2019s test of abilities that happened every three months!Through the memories of this body, Xiao Chen knew that everyone in the Xiao Clan, regardless of young or old, would be required to undergo a test of abilities every three months.It assessed their current cultivation status; those who improved would be rewarded, and those who were lazy and stagnated would be punished. The punishments could be either light or heavy, depending on the severity of the case. Most of the young disciples of the clan would be in a good mood on this day; those with outstanding talents in particular looked forward to this day so they could\u00a0impress\u00a0everyone and brag about their strength.However, this day was a torment to Xiao Chen. Ever since he stagnated in his cultivation since the age of 8, he had been stuck at the 9th Grade of the realm of Spirit Refinement. He was not able to take the next step and condense a Martial Spirit, which would allow him to turn into a true cultivator.For eight years, this event had turned into his nightmare every single time. Each time he was tested, he was still at the 9th Grade of the Realm of Spirit Refinement without a shred of improvement. As for the other disciples at his age, they had already reached the peak of Martial Disciple, and some of the stronger ones had even advanced into the Martial Master Realm.When Xiao Chen arrived at the martial hall, the huge martial training grounds of a few hundred square meters was filled with people. If they were counted, there would be no less than 800 people, who were all disciples of the young generation in the Xiao Clan. They were no older than twenty, yet the weakest one had a cultivation at Martial Disciple Realm. Through this, the strength of Mohe City's number one clan, the Xiao Clan, could be clearly seen.He simply just found a corner and stood there. He did not hold any extravagant hope that he could shine here, wanting nothing than to come and go, quietly and peacefully.At this moment, there was an old man standing beside the Magic Sealing Stone that was used to measure one\u2019s strength. This person was the Xian Clan\u2019s First Elder, Xiao Qiang. He was a Peak Martial Grand Master, his strength in the Xiao Clan second only to the clan head, Xiao Xiong. Within Mohe City, he was considered an expert.A youth seemingly eighteen or nineteen years old stood in front of the Magic Sealing Stone. He was preparing to undergo the test, but when he turned his head, he inadvertently noticed Xiao Chen in the corner.The corner of the youth\u2019s mouth curled up slightly, revealing a trace of a sneer. He called out in a peculiar tone, \u201cSo Brother Chen has arrived already; why are you standing so far away? Since you are here, how about I let Brother Chen take the test first?\u201dXiao Chen smiled bitterly. There were some matters that were more likely to happen the more you avoided them. He already stood so far away, yet he was still seen by someone. The person who spoke was Xiao Jian, who was Xiao Chen\u2019s elder brother that shared the same father but had a different mother. During every test, he would always make things difficult for Xiao Chen.Xiao Chen started cultivating at the age of 4. Within a year, he could feel the Essence of Heaven and Earth, and within another year\u2019s time, he achieved the 1st Grade of Spirit Refinement. In another three years, before he turned eight, he achieved the 9th Grade of Spirit Refinement. He appeared to have been at the cusp of consolidating his Martial Spirit. Back then, he was a rare talent that appeared only once in a hundred years in the Xiao Clan.At that time, Xiao Jian was still hovering around the 5th Grade of Spirit Refinement. Everyone in the Xiao Clan paid attention to Xiao Chen, and the elders of the clan would lavish all sorts of praises on Xiao Chen. Xiao Jian became just like a puppet, forgotten by everyone.Since then, he hated Xiao Chen. They were both Xiao Xiong\u2019s sons, so why was it that Xiao Chen was loved by everyone and yet he was forgotten?The surrounding Xiao Clan disciples appeared to be expecting a good spectacle. During every test of abilities, Xiao Jian would use many different methods to humiliate Xiao Chen; they were all used to it already. Furthermore, whenever they saw how the genius of the past had fallen into the state of being the trash he was at present, they felt an indescribable delight in their hearts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xiao Jian turned towards the crowd and slowly walked over. The crowd opened up a passageway for him, with the expectation that this was going to be a good show written all over their faces as they looked at Xiao Chen.\u201cBrother Chen, why are you not moving? Are you not going to give your big brother some face?\u201d Xiao Jian said sinisterly as he grabbed Xiao Chen\u2019s wrist with his right hand, leading him to the front.However, when he pulled, he found that he was not able to move Xiao Chen\u2019s wrist. He could not help but be alarmed \u2013 how could this trash have such immense strength? Right as he was about to use his Essence to make Xiao Chen submit...Xiao Chen flung his hand away ferociously, managing to fling away Xiao Jian\u2019s hand under the eyes of the crowd, and replied coldly. \u201cThere is no need for big brother to exert himself. I can walk by myself.\u201dThere was a burst of amazed mutterings. How was this trash able to fling away Xiao Jian\u2019s hand? Although Xiao Jian did not use the Essence in his body, his cultivation had already reached the peak of the superior Grade of Martial Disciple, which meant he was only a step away from becoming a Martial Master. His cultivation realm was definitely higher than Xiao Chen\u2019s by a few realms, so could that trash possibly have experienced a miracle and condensed his Martial Spirit?Xiao Jian, whose hand was flung away by Xiao Chen, stared blankly for a period of time, but his expression immediately turned unsightly shortly after. This Xiao Chen actually dared to make him lose face in front of everyone. He gloomily followed Xiao Chen and walked over.\u00a0He did not stop to think that he had said something to try and humiliate Xiao Chen in the first place.Xiao Chen, who was standing in front of the Magic Sealing Stone, wore a bitter expression. He was very clear on what realm of cultivation he was in, but he no longer had any path of retreat. The worst case scenario was that he would be ridiculed again, but thinking of this actually calmed him down.Xiao Chen stretched out his right hand and placed it on the Magic Sealing Stone, circulating the weak Spiritual Energy in his body. Threads of Spiritual Energy flowed from his Dantian into the acupoints on his arms, through his meridians, and rapidly gathered on his right palm. The Magic Sealing Stone under his palm started to change color, and the initial pure white slowly turned into a faint red color.In a short while, Xiao Chen\u2019s forehead was filled with droplets of sweat, and the Magic Sealing Stone seemed to have some kind of devouring power that made the Spiritual Energy in his body continuously flow out. However, the color of the Magic Sealing Stone still remained an unchanged faint red.\u201cXiao Chen, 9th Grade of Spirit Refinement. There is no improvement.\u201d The First Elder\u00a0behind the Magic Sealing Stone, Xiao Qiang, said without emotion.Xiao Chen shook his head, withdrew his right hand, and wiped the sweat off his forehead. The surrounding Xiao Clan disciples breathed out in relief. This trash was still the trash he was before. There were no miracles, and his strength was still at the 9th Grade of Spirit Refinement.Xiao Jian laughed coldly. Actually, he had been startled by him earlier. Now, he remembered that he wanted to bully him, and thus he immediately recovered his earlier mindset of wanting to create trouble for him.\u201cBrother Chen, you are indeed an abnormal talent. Despite eight years of cultivation, you are actually still in the 9th Grade of Spirit Refinement. Within the whole Xiao Clan, no, the whole Great Qin Nation, only you have such a talent! Haha!\u201dAll the Xiao Clan disciples within the big hall laughed together. The first elder behind the Magic Sealing Stone just frowned but did not say anything. He felt that it was a pity, as Xiao Jian had acceptable talent and was hardworking enough in his cultivation, but he had next to no compassion. He would definitely not climb far in the future. He was not sure if this kid could survive in the Promise of Ten Years that would occur half a year later.Xiao Chen kept his quiet and maintained a cold expression. This was his elder brother, who, instead of consoling him, went so far as to take the lead in humiliating him. Having such an older sibling was as good as having none!Xiao Jian stretched out his hands and patted Xiao Chen\u2019s shoulders, smiling strangely. \u201cBrother Chen, do not be discouraged, take it slow. Maybe you can condense your Martial Spirit in a few more years. Hey, Brother Chen, why are you kneeling? Don\u2019t be like this, I do not deserve such treatment.\u201dXiao Jian used his Essence when he patted Xiao Chen, using about half the strength of a Peak Martial Disciple. Considering Xiao Chen had humiliated him earlier in front of everyone, he did not intend to let him off so easily.Xiao Chen knelt on the ground on one knee, his forehead filled with sweat. After Xiao Jian infused his hand with Essence, it heavily pressed down on his shoulder. Regardless of the amount of strength he used, he was not able to resist Xiao Jian.There was a mocking voice coming from the crowd, \u201cYoung Master Chen, even with such outstanding cultivation, you don\u2019t have to use such a method to display it!\u201d\u201cYoung Master Chen is indeed Young Master Chen \u2013 even the way he kneels exhibits such elegance.\u201dXiao Chen closed both of his eyes. He tightly clenched his fist, causing his fingernails to dig into his flesh. Fresh blood slowly dripped out, and his whole body could not stop trembling.Dissatisfaction!He was not resigned!A fierce resentment that stemmed from the depths of his soul began to pervade Xiao Chen\u2019s body. He was not resigned! Is that you? Xiao Chen murmured. This fierce resentment from the depths of the soul itself seemed to come from the original soul of this body. Even after he died, the resentment that had accumulated for eight years came bursting out\u2014he was not resigned!No one would willingly be a piece of trash! No one would be able to indefinitely endure the mockings and humiliations from others! No one would willingly look up to others for the rest of their life!You are Xiao Chen; I am Xiao Chen as well. I will live in place of you, washing away these eight years of humiliations. I will cause those who mocked you, insulted you, and teased you to understand what regret is!Xiao Chen fiercely opened his eyes. A radiant look replaced that cold and empty look he usually wore, the determination in his eyes staunch. I, Xiao Chen, will not be trash forever!He pushed his body downwards and quickly rolled backward, standing behind the Magic Sealing Stone. He looked at Xiao Jian with a cold gaze. Xiao Jian was pleased with himself when he saw the surrounding Xiao Clan disciples laughing at Xiao Chen. He had relaxed his state of mind from when he was caught off guard and had inadvertently let Xiao Chen escape from his grasp. He could not help but feel frustrated again at the thought of it and was about to make a move.A piece of broken cloth flew out and hit him in the face, slapping him with a great force. The piece of cloth had been torn from Xiao Chen\u2019s sleeve. Naturally, that meant the one who did that was Xiao Chen.\u201cVery good, since you have already received it, I hereby challenge you to a life-and-death duel seven days later. From now on, you are no longer my big brother, and you never will be again!\u201d Xiao Chen looked coldly at Xiao Jian and spoke, his cold voice seeming\u00a0to emerge\u00a0from the nine layers of Hell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He held back the Essence he gathered in his hands and dispelled the Martial Technique he was about to execute, the Inferno Chop. After staring blankly into empty space for a while, he quickly understood what Xiao Chen meant with his words, looking at him as though he had just seen a ghost.Not just him, everyone in the martial training grounds also understood what Xiao Chen meant when he said that he had accepted it. A commotion broke out among the crowd, who then also looked at Xiao Chen as though they had seen a ghost.Duel Rites!What Xiao Chen had just performed was the Duel Rites of the Tianwu Continent. There were many different kinds of Duel Rites in the Tianwu Continent. For instance, if you threw your handkerchief at the opponent and he catches it, it meant that the opponent had accepted the challenge. The nature of this kind of duel was genial, and most challenges were of this type. According to the different cultures and practices of their land, there were different types of Duel Rites.However, regardless of the place, there was one kind of Duel Rite that was universal\u2014furthermore, a duel of that nature was the cruelest. It was the act of hitting someone\u2019s face using a piece of torn cloth from one\u2019s sleeves. If the cloth hits the target, then the request for the duel was automatically approved. And once the duel started, it was a fight to the death.However, Xiao Chen was at the 9th Grade of Spirit Refinement. Without any Martial Techniques, wouldn\u2019t it be nothing short of seeking death if he challenged a peak Martial Disciple to this kind of duel?In the Tianwu Continent, Martial Cultivators reigned supreme; the realms of Martial Cultivation were divided into the initial Spirit Refinement, Martial Disciple, Martial Master, Martial Grand Master, Martial Saint, Martial King, Martial Monarch, Martial Sage, and Martial Emperor. The Spirit Refinement Realm was split into 9 Grades, whereas the Martial Disciple Realm and above were split into the Inferior Grade,\u00a0Medial\u00a0Grade, and Superior Grade.On the road of Martial Cultivation, the Spirit Refinement phase was considered to be the most challenging, and only after achieving the 9th Grade of Spirit Refinement and condensing the Martial Spirit could one be considered to be a true cultivator.For people with good talent, they would be able to condense their Martial Spirit before the age of ten. If the Martial Spirit was condensed after the age of ten, then that person\u2019s accomplishments on the martial path would definitely be limited. The earlier a person condenses their Martial Spirit, the more they would accomplish in the future.Within the Xiao Clan, in a desolated courtyard, Xiao Chen sat cross-legged on the bed in a bedroom and followed the cultivation method of his new body to absorb the Spiritual Energy of Heaven and Earth.Threads of Spiritual Energy surged towards him from all directions, entering his body via the 720 major and minor acupoints through his pores. Afterwards, the Spirit Energy moved along the meridians like a tiny snake, slithering towards the Dantian. The Spirit Energy from all directions moved via the meridians and converged in one spot.There was a formless mass in the location of the Dantian; the Spiritual Energy circled above the Dantian once, turning into countless strands of Spiritual Energy, and returned to the meridians. Xiao Chen was not resigned and tried to gather the Spiritual Energy again and used a new volley of energy strands to put pressure on the Dantian, but the Spiritual Energy merely circled the Dantian as before and returned to sit in the meridians. After a few tries, the Spiritual Energy in his surroundings began to thin out, yet the energy could still not enter the Dantian.Finally, all of the Spiritual Energy flowed in reverse, through the meridians and acupoints, entering the skin and muscles to slowly nourish Xiao Chen\u2019s bones, skin, and muscles before completely disappearing.Xiao Chen stopped cultivating, subsequently pounding down on his bed in frustration\u2014he still could not overcome this hurdle.Ever since Xiao Chen entered the 9th Grade of Spirit Refinement, the Spiritual Energy he absorbed would not gather in his Dantian. Instead, every last bit of it permeated his bones, skin, and muscles, causing his body to be tempered until it was incomparably tough and durable, which also gave him a shocking level of strength.If the opponent did not use Essence, even if they were a Martial Master Realm \u2018martial cultivator\u2019, they would not be able to compete against him in strength. This was the reason why he was able to struggle free of Xiao Jian earlier.However, if he was not able to condense his Martial Spirit, then he had no way to distill the Spiritual Energy of Heaven and Earth into the more condensed Essence. The Martial Techniques for Martial Disciples and onwards required Essence to execute. Regardless of his physical strength, in front of a Martial Master using Essence, only a path to death existed. Could it be that he had no way to escape death in seven days?Suddenly, a thought appeared in his head \u2013 that Compendium of Cultivation that he had purchased from Taobao... he was not able to cultivate it on Earth, but perhaps it was possible to cultivate it in this world? The existence of the Martial Spirit meant that he might not be able to form a Jindan or a Yuanying, but what about cultivating?The Spiritual Energy of Heaven and Earth did not exist in his previous world, but it existed everywhere in this world. The more he thought about it, the more possible it seemed.In the Compendium of Cultivation, there was only one Immortal Cultivation Method, which was the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation. He had read the Compendium of Cultivation for three years and had been able to memorize it long ago. He sat down cross-legged again and started to cultivate according to the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation.The Purple Thunder Divine Incantation had a total of 12 layers, so he could naturally only start cultivating from the first layer. He silently mouthed the incantation, immediately able to clearly feel the surrounding Spiritual Energy stir, and began to feel delight in his heart. Xiao Chen calmed his emotions and continued to circulate the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation. At this moment, he absolutely could not afford to be too eager and impatient.The surrounding Spiritual Energy continuously gushed forth, percolating him in the incomparably clear feeling of the Spiritual Energy seeping into his pores. The threads of Spiritual Energy that entered his body were like little fishes that swam around with utter glee, which resulted in an indescribably carefree feeling. The speed and density of the absorption of Spiritual Energy was faster and denser by several times.The Spiritual Energy swam happily through his meridians; Xiao Chen\u2019s thin meridians expanded and continuously turned wider under the influence of the thick and dense Spiritual Energy. The Spiritual Energy flowed rapidly and, in an instant, completed a small circuit in front of his chest.The alarming speed of it made Xiao Chen feel a little apprehensive, hurriedly calming down and slowing the pace of the Spiritual Energy\u2019s circulation down a notch. After it completed a cycle, the Spiritual Energy returned and tarried above the Dantian.Xiao Chen started to get nervous. He hadn\u2019t given up yet, so he did his best to control the Spiritual Energy, carefully directing it inch by inch towards the formless mass that was his Dantian and pressed on it. The boundless spiritual energy was like a flood dragon and slowly swam to the side of the Dantian.The feeling he got was different from the previous times he attempted this. This time, his mind could clearly feel a flexible barrier in his Dantain preventing the Spiritual Energy from infiltrating it. The feeling of Spiritual Energy moving forward was becoming more obvious until, finally, the Spiritual energy could no longer proceed forward.Xiao Chen hardened his heart and caused the rest of the Spiritual Energy scattered in his meridians to gather above his Dantian, immediately afterwards prompting it to ferociously charge downwards.There was a loud bang, and the Spiritual Energy bounced back, causing a huge wave. Xiao Chen could feel that his organs and viscera had shifted, and a thread of fresh blood leaked out from the corner of his mouth. He turned pale with fright. Quickly recollecting himself, he slowly channeled his Spiritual Energy into the organs that were damaged.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After this lesson, he no longer dared to use Spiritual Energy to forcefully break into the Dantian.After his injuries had stabilized, he slowly restored the circulation of the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation, continuously absorbing countless threads of Spiritual Energy. After going through a cycle in his meridians, the Spiritual energy permeated into Xiao Chen\u2019s bones, skin, and muscle.He had made his decision. Since he temporarily could not condense his Martial Spirit, then he would temper his body to become extremely tough.Xiao Chen lost track of time as he cultivated, having already finished 36 cycles without realizing it. Opening his eyes, two dots of purple light flashed across in his eyes. At the moment, the sky was bright, which rendered him speechless, as he had actually spent the entire night cultivating inside the house.Despite having not slept for a night, Xiao Chen\u2019s mind felt invigorated, without a single trace of fatigue to speak of. Shortly after, Xiao Chen noticed an odd scent. Glancing down, he realized a thick layer of sticky black fluid had settled on his body, the smell of it unbearably fishy.These were the impurities and waste material in Xiao Chen\u2019s body. In the past, when Xiao Chen cultivated, his body would at most have a layer of sweat covering it. However, the entirety of last night was spent in cultivation with thrice the absorption speed of previous sessions This caused the extreme scene we see now\u2014and those who were not aware of the situation would probably assume that Xiao Chen had fallen into a latrine.Xiao Chen smiled bitterly and quickly went to take a shower. If he went out like this, it would definitely cause many misunderstandings. After the shower, he changed into a new set of clothes and made his way to the courtyard. He got into position and began practicing the Xiao Clan\u2019s most ordinary fist techniques.The Xiao Clan\u2019s fist technique had a sequence of movements that united the motions of rising, falling, advancing, and retreating, which made it seem extremely plain. Xiao Chen struck out extremely smoothly, emitting a wave of wind from his fist. Without realizing it himself, the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation in his body automatically circulated together with the movements.The originally plain fist technique actually seemed to turn tyrannical and mighty. His hands struck out and pulled back alternatively, and the sound of thunder seemed to fill the air. This change caused Xiao Chen to be beside himself with joy as he did not expect the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation to have such an effect.The more he struck out, the more delighted he felt. His fist became faster and faster, and the roar of thunder continuously rang out. Without realizing it, as he shouted out softly, electricity could be seen arching non-stop on his fist. A hot sensation traveled to his right hand, and his entire right hand seemed to inhabit an inexhaustible strength.Xiao Chen shouted loudly, his whole body leaping forth, and when he landed, his fist struck down on the ground. Xiao Chen used the strength of his whole body in this fist.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe rocks were crushed in great numbers. Amongst the countless cracks, there was a small hole about half a meter wide. Xiao Chen held his breath as he looked at the crushed rocks and shook his head.The might of this fist might have seemed ferocious, but he knew that this was nothing. When the strong Martial Cultivators used this Martial Technique, it could create a big hole that was at least a meter wide. Furthermore, there would not be any cracks. The crushed rocks would all be turned into powder.However, Xiao Chen was very satisfied. He had to take it step by step. He had only cultivated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation for a night, yet his strength was already so shocking. After cultivating for a few more days, his body might be able to be comparable to those of the Martial Disciple Realm. Furthermore, the electricity on his fists would give others a\u00a0shocking\u00a0surprise.After resting for a while, Xiao Chen decided to continue his cultivation. Only, he could not go back to the bedroom to cultivate anymore. He had to find a place with denser Spiritual Energy. The back mountains, Seven Horn Mountain, of the Xiao Clan was such a place.This Seven Horn Mountain could be said to be the source of the Xiao Clan\u2019s footing. There were many Spirit Beasts and rare herbs on the mountain. Furthermore, the density of the Spiritual Energy there was more than one fold than that of the area where he currently was.In the memories of this body, the Xiao Clan was considered to have been a humongous clan many years ago, and not just in the Great Qin Nation but also in the Tianwu Continent. They only came to Mohe City after they had declined.The previous generation of the Xiao Clan had used their martial strength to occupy this mountain. Relying on the countless treasures from Seven Horn Mountain, the Xiao Clan slowly established a firm foothold in Mohe City, turning into the number one clan in the area.The only downside being that such a treasure trove would naturally cause the eyes of others to go red with jealousy. Because of this Seven Horn Mountain, there was an unending stream of conflicts and disputes. In that period, the local clans of Mohe City and Xiao Clan had many large-scale battles, causing tremendous loss to both sides.Finally, under the mediation of the City Lord of Mohe City, all the clans within Mohe City came to an agreement. Every ten years, they would hold a competition, and all the youths from the clans under the age of twenty would participate in it. The victor would decide who acquired the rights to Seven Horn Mountain.Both sides took a step back, and the Xiao Clan also did not dare to offend all the surrounding clans and agreed to it.Although the Xiao Clan\u2019s power had declined, they had managed to clinch victory in the past three martial arts competitions. The next Promise of Ten Years would occur in another half a year. The Xiao Clan had for this competition placed all of its hope on Xiao Jian and the mysterious granddaughter of the\u00a0First Elder.While recollecting the history of Seven Horn Mountain, Xiao Chen had already arrived at its foot. There was a pass erected at the foot, which was where the elite troops of the Xiao Clan had been stationed. If anyone not from the Xiao Clan sought entrance, aside from having to apply to do so first, they had to pay an entrance fee.Xiao Chen, as the son of the Clan Head, naturally did not have to undergo such menial procedures to enter Seven Horn Mountain. However, when the guard from the Xiao Clan found out that he wanted to enter, he made things difficult for him.Who had not heard of the second young master and his cultivation at the 9th Grade of Spirit Refinement\u2014that he was the famous trash of Mohe City? If he entered Seven Horn Mountain, death would be the only thing in store for him. When the Clan Head started to look for people to blame, he would definitely be punished.\u201cSecond young master, the Spirit Beasts within the mountain are very ferocious. It is not a fun place to be. It is better that second young master does not go in.\u201d One of the guards advised. In fact, the guard had wanted to say more but did not, refraining from adding how the Misty Rain Pavilion inside the safe walls of the city would be more fitting for him rather than, frankly speaking, seeking an early death in this place.When Xiao Chen heard this, he smiled. He did not mind the tone of this guard. \u201cWho said that I am going up the mountain to play? I am going to cultivate. Could it be that, as the son of the Clan Head,\u00a0I do not have the rights to enter this mountain for cultivation?\u201dThat same guard seemed to want to say something more, but the person behind him held him back, smiled, and spoke. \u201cSince the second young master is going to cultivate, we will naturally not obstruct you. We just hope that young master does not wander too deep and keeps away from the inner mountain.\u201d\u201cThat is natural.\u201d When Xiao Chen said that, he walked away without looking back.\u201cWhy are we letting him in? This is akin to sending him to his death.\u201d The guard that spoke earlier said.\u201cYour information network is not effective\u2014haven\u2019t you heard of his duel with Xiao Jian? It\u2019s a duel of life and death! Let him enter. Even if he dies in the clutches of a spirit beast, it would still be better than dying at the hands of Xiao Jian.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Having cultivated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation, he could feel how his perception had grown sharper than it was before. He could clearly feel that the forest in the mountain was filled with the Spiritual Energy of Heaven and Earth. At the moment, he was looking for the area with the densest Spiritual Energy inside within the surroundings of the mountain range.Although he did not succeed in condensing his Martial Spirit yesterday, he had not given up on hope. In the Compendium of Cultivation, aside from the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation, which was a foundation for cultivating, there were also the methods of refining medicinal pills.Based on his experience so far, he discovered that the herbs of this world were identical to those recorded in the Compendium of Cultivation. As long as he cultivated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation for a period of time and condensed the most basic flames, he could refine medicinal pills. With the aid of medicinal pills, there would be some hope in condensing his Martial Spirit.Suddenly, by virtue of Xiao Chen\u2019s perception, he noticed an area roughly 500 meters in front of him. There seemed to be an abundance of Spiritual Energy there. He raised his head to take a better look. The vegetation was\u00a0lush, sturdy, and vigorous, whereas the trees in this spot seemed to be thicker than those in other areas. Xiao Chen smiled, having finally found it, and pushed aside the branches in his way and dashed over.When he was near the place with abundant Spiritual Energy, Xiao Chen stopped. This kind of place would usually have a strong Spirit Beast lurking around. The perception of Spirit Beasts exceeded a human\u2019s, so it was impossible for them to not sense it. Such a good cultivation ground would definitely have already been occupied.He had to find it first. The strongest Spirit Beasts in these parts were only Rank 2, about equivalent to a human peak Martial Disciple. With Xiao Chen\u2019s current cultivation, in addition to the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation and if he took advantage of his surroundings, he could find an opportunity to kill it.There was a cool breeze, causing the leaves to dance lightly and gracefully. Xiao Chen used his nose to sniff the air, catching wind of a light scent of blood. However, this scent had been around for a long time and had turned faint. If Xiao Chen\u2019s nose was not sensitive, he might not have caught whiff of it.Could it be that the Spirit Beast he was tracking down had already been slain by someone? Xiao Chen thought deeply, with some suspicions in mind. He advanced by another few steps, only to finally see the dead Spirit Beast under a tree.After Xiao Chen took a closer look, he was shocked. This dead Spirit Beast was a Two-Tailed Spirit Fox. Looking at the wounds on the body, he only noticed a sword wound on its neck, having been killed with just one slash of the sword by someone.The Two-Tailed Spirit Fox was a peak existence of the Rank 2 Spirit Beast. Well-renowned for its monstrous speed, it could be said to be unrivaled within the outskirts of Seven Horn Mountain. Furthermore, this Spirit Beast was very intelligent and cunning. If it encountered a strong opponent, it would take the first opportunity it could to flee.However, given its condition, it was obvious that the moment it was discovered, it was killed with a slash and died immediately without even the chance to flee. When Xiao Chen thought of this, he could not help but shudder.The Two-Tailed Spirit Fox was extremely fast, so how quick did this strike have to be in order to kill it in one slash? This person was definitely at least in the Martial Master Realm.Suddenly, there was a faint sound of movement from behind him, and a sense of danger overwhelmed him. Crap! Xiao Chen quickly reacted, circulating the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation quickly. He pushed strongly with his feet as a hot energy spread to his feet, causing his body to leap up into the sky.His hands clutched a tree branch about 2 meters high. Using it as suspension, he nimbly swung his body and somersaulted, landing lightly on it.He touched his back and discovered a wound from a sword. The wound was not deep, but it was bleeding quite profusely. Looking at the blood on his hands, Xiao Chen took a deep breath. If he had not avoided it in time, this slash could have split him in twain at the waist.Xiao Chen looked down, catching sight of the perpetrator, who was a girl that did not seem older than twenty. Her facial appearance was picturesque. Her skin was smooth and fair; she had fine black hair tied into a ponytail that was hanging on her shoulder; and her face was charming like a flower.With the green clothes she wore, she exhibited the semblance of an otherworldly fairy. However, her eyes were filled with killing intent. They were incredibly cold, and under her gaze, even the air seemed to freeze.The young girl held a slender sword in her hands, which flashed with a cold light. The body of the sword was emitting a faint moonlight, revealing it to be a Spirit Weapon.In the Tianwu Continent, there was a peculiar ore, the Moonstone. When blacksmiths forged weapons, as long as they mixed in some Moonstone dust, the quality of the weapon would undergo a qualitative leap, turning it into a Spirit Weapon.Spirit Weapons were very strong. Aside from the fact that they were very sharp, they could fuse with the strength of the Martial Spirit, which would raise the cultivator\u2019s strength to their peak.This person seemed to be familiar\u2014Xiao Chen sifted through his memories for a long time before remembering. Seeing that the girl in front of him wanted to make another move, he hurriedly spoke, \u201cCousin Yulan, please don\u2019t move. I am Xiao Chen, have you forgotten me?\u201dThis was the granddaughter of the First Elder, Xiao Yulan. Going by the family tree, she was a distant cousin on his mother\u2019s side. Xiao Chen was not very familiar with her, recalling that this cousin of his was very reclusive since young. He barely saw her after the age of ten, and all he heard was that she had been in solitary cultivation and seemed to be very mysterious.Xiao Yulan frowned, as though she was thinking, and then withdrew her sword. She gently parted her lips and said in an apologetic tone, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cousin Xiao Chen. What are you doing here?\u201dAfter seeing her withdraw her sword, Xiao Chen released his breath. He jumped down from the tree branch, explaining, \u201cI saw that the Spirit Energy in this place was abundant and wanted to cultivate here.\u201d\u201cIn the future, when cousin comes to this kind of place where Spirit Energy is abundant, you must be more cautious. These kinds of places will normally have strong Spirit Beasts protecting them.\u201d Xiao Yulan suddenly stopped, as though she remembered something, and took out a jade bottle and passed it to Xiao Chen.\u201cThis is a superior grade Golden Salve. It is effective on the sword wound on your back. I have been cultivating here for these few days and have chased away many of the Spirit Beasts that wanted to snatch this area away. Cousin can relax and stay here to cultivate, so consider this bottle of Golden Salve my compensation to you. I shall take my leave then.\u201dXiao Chen received the Golden Slave and thoughtfully watched the beautiful image of Xiao Yulan leaving. She killed the Two-Tailed Spirit Fox with a slash... this level of cultivation meant she was definitely much stronger than that arrogant Xiao Jian.Only, why was she not willing to reveal herself? Could it be that she had always been on this Seven Horn Mountain, cultivating and killing all sorts of Spirit Beasts?Xiao Chen pondered on it carefully for a period of time and came to the conclusion that it was very possible. The expression that Xiao Yulan had when she was looking at him initially was as though she was looking at a Spirit Beast, lacking any emotion. If he had not called out her name all of a sudden, he might have already become a corpse.It did not matter, as he did not have much time left. The Spiritual Energy in this place was incomparably abundant, so he needed to cultivate first before doing other things. He found a big, sturdy tree and leaped up onto the branches, after which he sat down in the lotus position and circulated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation to absorb the surrounding Spiritual Energy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In an instant, Xiao Chen could feel the vigorous Spiritual Energy gushing forth. The meridians that were widened by the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation were quickly filled.The Spiritual Energy circulated quickly in the eight major meridians. Xiao Chen no longer dared trying to force the Spiritual Energy into the Dantian like the day before and instead obediently used the Spiritual Energy to nourish his bones, skin, and muscles.He alternated between breathing in and out, and his breathing started to stabilize. He entered into a state of nothingness, as though he had become one with the mountain range.This state was maintained for about four hours. The Spiritual Energy within a few hundred meters of Xiao Chen suddenly became agitated, and the boundless and majestic Spiritual Energy was frantically being drawn into Xiao Chen\u2019s body by an unknown force.Xiao Chen, who had entered into a state of nothingness, was suddenly shocked by the situation. This Spiritual Energy was like a big river, unceasingly pouring into his body. The Spiritual Energy in his meridians became increasingly thick, causing Xiao Chen, who was already saturated with Spiritual Energy, to feel pain.If this went on for another hour, he would without a doubt explode and die. He could not control the circulation of the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation, which frantically continued to circulate by itself at a speed faster than usual by at least two folds.What was going on? A deep fear crept up into Xiao Chen\u2019s mind. Am I going to die like this?The surging Spiritual Energy continuously gushed into his body. He did his best to redirect the Spiritual Energy in his meridians to his bones, skin, and muscles, but he could not keep up with the rate of the Spiritual Energy that was pouring into his body.His meridians were already starting to show some tiny cracks, and mixed in with the crack were some traces of fresh blood. A strong wave of pain was sent to his brain, and Xiao Chen grunted and nearly fainted from the pain.He sent his consciousness down, observing that his Dantian was still a formless mass. He clenched his jaw and decided to take a gamble. If this Spiritual Energy could not find an outlet, then he would explode and die soon. Only by successfully condensing his Martial Spirit could he refine the Spiritual Energy into Essence.After making that decision, his consciousness immediately controlled the Spiritual Energy to smash against the Dantian. This Spiritual Energy was much stronger than the Spiritual Energy he had used before, and just like before, when it got close to the Dantian, it stopped.However, this time, it did not bounce back. From the three major meridians of the chest, another wave of strong Spiritual Energy came and merged with the other, forming a stronger whole. And then with a bang, it slammed into the barrier surrounding the Dantian.Xiao Chen vomited a mouthful of fresh blood, but the Spiritual Energy still did not enter the Dantian.He did not believe that he could not break the barrier, but he tried for a few more times and inadvertently failed. Xiao Chen started to get angry and continuously controlled the Spiritual Energy to smash against the barrier around the Dantian. After the fifth attempt, Xiao Chen had already vomited five mouthfuls of blood. However, this time, he could obviously feel that the barrier softened.He felt joy in his heart. But instead of gathering the Spiritual Energy to attempt again, he took a deep breath and allowed the Spiritual Energy in his body to accumulate freely. In a short moment, the gathered Spiritual Energy was stronger than earlier. It surged, under the control of Xiao Chen\u2019s consciousness, and seemed to have turned into a Flood Dragon, snarling at the Dantian as it smashed against it.\u201cBoom!\u201dThere was a loud boom that came from Xiao Chen\u2019s body. The barrier in the Dantian that had obstructed Xiao Chen\u2019s progress for eight years was actually broken. He ignored the pain and sent his consciousness down, wanting to see what was causing the problem within his Dantian.A pair of eyes suddenly appeared and watched him. The eyes were like burning torches, showing a certain might.Xiao Chen felt like a big mountain was pressing down on him. In this place, he was like an ant, and the desire to worship this entity seemed to influence him. However, before he could be awed, an intense pain caused him to faint.When Xiao Chen fainted, the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation did not stop circulating, which meant the surrounding Spiritual Energy still continuously poured into his body.Unlike before, this Spiritual Energy did not get absorbed into his flesh and bones. It was all gathered in his Dantian. The Dantian, which was originally a formless mass, seemed to have dispersed, and inside it was a small young Azure Dragon.The eyes of the Azure Dragon were closed, and its five claws were slightly parted. It was greedily sucking in the Spiritual Energy that was pouring in, its two whiskers gently swaying. It seemed extremely comfortable, and its whole body rapidly swam around in circles, continuously sucking in Spiritual Energy. The soft skin of the Azure Dragon slowly hardened, and only its shape did not change.The surrounding Spiritual Energy slowly started to grow thin. Even places with denser Spiritual Energy would not be able to keep up with the rate the Azure Dragon was consuming it. Slowly, the surrounding Spiritual Energy was completely sucked dry, and the recovery of the Spiritual Energy of Heaven and Earth would require a long time.The Azure Dragon did not seem satisfied and continued to demand more. However, there was no more Spiritual Energy left in Xiao Chen\u2019s body. When it saw Xiao Chen\u2019s strong flesh, his body started to shrivel up\u2014this Azure Dragon actually wanted to extract the Spiritual Energy within his flesh.The Azure Dragon continued to absorb for another hour before stopping, its Azure skin turning even more solid and strong. It opened its eyes, extended its five claws, swam around in lively fashion, and raised its head while releasing a ferocious roar, as if it was trapped for countless years and had finally seen daylight again!This ferocious roar came out of Xiao Chen\u2019s body, skyrocketing and piercing through the sky. The Spirit Beasts of the outer region of the Seven Horn Mountain all prostrated in fear. This sound seemed to contain a mighty pressure, as though it was made to cause them to feel fear.At the same time, the Sect Masters of the Passionate Phoenix Palace, White Emperor City, and the Divine Martial Gate of the Tianwu Continent all stopped what they were doing and looked into the distance, mumbling the same words\u2014the Azure Dragon has awakened!At this moment, Xiao Chen finally woke up. The first thing he noticed was the changes to his body, which had shriveled up. However, he could not be bothered about this. He remembered that there had been a pair of mysterious eyes within his Dantian, which made him feel terrified. He quickly sat up into the lotus position and sent his consciousness into his Dantian.But he no longer saw the eyes, only a small Azure Dragon. There were a few white clouds floating in its surrounding, and its eyes were closed, silently waiting.What was going on... he had clearly seen a pair of eyes that contained a strong vigor and might, such that he would never forget it. Could it be this was the work of that little Azure Dragon?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At this moment, that Azure Dragon suddenly opened its eyes, startling Xiao Chen. The Azure Dragon\u00a0did not seem to notice him\u00a0and soon it closed both its eyes.Xiao Chen hurriedly withdrew his consciousness, the gaze of the Azure Dragon was clear, its pupils like a clear spring. Its gaze seemed to be able to draw out the souls of people and cause them to serve it.However, what was this Azure Dragon? He did not remember a dragon entering his body. Could it be a Martial Spirit? Had he succeeded in condensing his Martial Spirit?Azure Dragon, Azure Dragon Martial Spirit, Xiao Chen suddenly recollected a very distant memory of this body.Long ago, the Tianwu Continent had four great sects, the Sect Master of these four great sects had the bloodline of Holy Beasts. The disciples of their clan were born naturally with the Holy Beast Martial Spirit. Their cultivation speeds were much faster than usual. Furthermore, the Holy Beast Martial Spirit had a spiritual nature, they were incomparable to regular Martial Spirits.The Azure Dragon of the East, the White Tiger of the West, the Vermilion Bird of the South, and the Black Tortoise of the North, each of the four great clans represented a cardinal direction. The Xiao Clan\u2019s bloodline was that of the Azure Dragon of the East. However, thousands of years ago, because of an unknown reason, the Azure Dragon Holy Beast Martial Spirit stopped appearing in the Xiao Clan and their rich, powerful and distinguished clan was reduced into a local clan of a small town.Xiao Chen shook his head, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to think about these stuff. He was only concerned with the fact that he had condensed his Martial Spirit and could now condense Essence to practice Martial Techniques. He might not lose to Xiao Jian seven days later.He once again sank his consciousness into his body, checking the status of the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation. Earlier, the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation was frantically circulating, like a sword tip pointing at his back. He didn\u2019t want to enter a situation where there was a possibility that he would explode again.What caused him to be pleasantly surprised was that the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation was circulating stably and that his cultivation realm had taken a big step forward. He had firmly consolidated the 1st layer.He temporarily ignored the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit and decided to focus on the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation for now. After cultivating the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation for a night, it could cause his strength to increase exponentially. Furthermore, when he punched out with his fist, electricity would be emitted, one could easily imagine how powerful his fists would be.He remembered that in the Compendium of Cultivation, it was written that after cultivating the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation, one could condense Purple Thunder True Fire. Since the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation\u2019s realm had stably consolidated at the 1st layer, Xiao Chen decided to give it a try.Xiao Chen got up and circulated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation. As he did so, the eyes of the Azure Dragon in his Dantian opened and the three white cloud floating around it slowly started to thin out.A pure and condensed Essence flowed from its body to Xiao Chen\u2019s meridians. Xiao Chen\u2019s mind was shocked, he could feel a sudden inflow of clear and cozy Essence. He carefully directed this energy to circulate within his body.Following the method in the Compendium of Cultivation, this Essence headed towards his right hand and gathered there. The energy then came out from the four major acupoints of Tianquan, Jugu, Quze, and Neiguan, to gather onto his middle finger.Suddenly there was a sizzling electrical light on his finger, it continuously flickered until all the electricity gathered onto the tip of his finger. A purple flame about the size of a peanut was formed.Xiao Chen looked at the flame that was unceasingly swaying, it seemed that it would be extinguished at any time. He smiled bitterly, not to mention killing people, even in his original world, this flame could only be used to light a cigarette.He waved his hands and extinguished the flame. Xiao Chen was not dispirited. The fact that he could succeed in condensing the flame on his first attempt was a great consolation.Only, he did not notice that when he was extinguishing the flame, a small spark wasn\u2019t completely extinguished and fell onto the ground. Once it touched the ground, it caused the surrounding dead branches and fallen leaves within half a meter to burn. The flame then died in a flash. If a pile of ashes was not left behind and if he could not feel the heat on his face, he wouldn\u2019t have believed that there was a fire here earlier.He was stupefied and just stood there blankly. After a while, Xiao Chen started to laugh wildly in joy. This flame was too strong, just a small spark had such a strong might. After training for a period of time, it should have a very strong destructive power.Xiao Chen did not detest practicing the summoning of the Purple Thunder True Fire. After a few hours of practice, with just a thought, the Purple Thunder True Fire would be summoned in an instant.\u201cPuchi!\u201dA shadow on a big tree flashed by above Xiao Chen\u2019s head and skimmed into the distance. Stopping what he was doing, Xiao Chen raised his head to take a look. That person was dressed in blue and he flew from tree to tree. In a blink of an eye, he left Xiao Chen\u2019s field of vision.This was not true flight, he was only using the momentum of hopping from tree to tree and an excellent movement technique to create the false impression that he was flying. Even so, the cultivation of that person was at least at the Martial Saint Realm.Since when did Mohe City have a Martial Saint in blue robes? What purpose did he have in coming to the Seven Horn Mountain of the Xiao Clan? Xiao Chen felt somewhat suspicious.Taking note of the direction that the person headed to, Xiao Chen hesitated for awhile before he decided to chase him to take a look. An expert at the realm of Martial Saint wouldn\u2019t come to this Seven Horn Mountain for no reason.He completely withdrew his energies and relied on the strength of his body to follow the direction that the person in blue went. Xiao Chen dashed frantically, even without using the Essence in his body, his body\u2019s strength was so great that his speed was shocking.The person in blue had a very fast speed, he had already disappeared without a trace. Xiao Chen could only move forward in a rough direction. If his luck was bad, then he would never find him.After about an hour, Xiao Chen heard people chatting in low voices, Xiao Chen quickly stopped and carefully listened. After determining the direction of the voices, he proceeded forward once again.The voices were getting clearer and clearer, Xiao Chen jumped onto a big tree and finally saw the person speaking. In an area, about 300 meters in front of him, the person in blue from earlier and a group of people were speaking in hushed voices.Strange, why was it people from the Zhang Clan? There was a group of people speaking to the person in blue, and they wore clothing that was embroidered with a certain pattern, the symbol of the Zhang Clan. They were the\u00a0strongest local power after the Xiao Clan, there were three white clouds embroidered on the chest area of their brown coats.\u201cHuchi!\u201dSuddenly there was the sound of panting behind him, Xiao Chen was startled and immediately circulated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation. He gathered the Purple Thunder True Fire in his right hands, ready to take action.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She found it strange and decided to inquire. \u201cCousin Xiao Chen, are you alright? You seem to be hurt.\u201dWithin just a day, Xiao Chen\u2019s figure had shriveled up, appearing incredibly weak. However, he had no overt wounds on his body, which was very strange.Xiao Chen smiled bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201dIn the forest in front, where the person in blue was located.\u201cElder Zhang, where is the cave of the predecessor you mentioned? Where have we been walking for all this time? I am running out of patience.\u201d The voice of the person in blue carried a trace of anger as he spoke impatiently.The person who was addressed as Elder Zhang appeared to be more than fifty years old, and his cultivation had already reached the peak of Martial Grand Master long ago. He was the Clan Head of the Zhang Clan.At this moment, when he faced the person in blue, he did not dare to slight him at all, instead replying respectfully. \u201cSenior, don\u2019t worry. That cave was accidentally discovered by one of my clan members,\u00a0we should arrive there in another fifteen minutes.\u201dThe person in blue just coldly snorted. \u201cThen lead the way!\u201dThe cave of a predecessor\u2014it was likely that strong Martial Techniques and Cultivation Methods were stored there. There were often such legends, of some coincidental discovery of a predecessor\u2019s cave that eventually lead to great cultivation gains for the individual who lucked out. The Seven Horn Mountain actually also had one of these caves of some predecessor.\u2026\u2026\u201cSo, cousin has already condensed his Martial Spirit, congratulations.\u201dXiao Chen kept quiet about the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit, only explaining that he was in this state due to condensing his Martial Spirit. It seemed this Xiao Yulan also knew of his reputation as trash, thus she did not question him further.\u201cShould we follow them?\u201d Seeing that the group of people had already gone far away, Xiao Chen sought Xiao Yulan\u2019s opinion.\u201cWe follow!\u201dXiao Yulan leaped down from the tree and gently landed on her feet. Afterwards, her figure flew forward by ten-some-odd meters, as though she was a green fairy. Within a few breaths of time, she was already more than a hundred meters away.What a fast speed, Xiao Chen quietly murmured. He leaped down from the tree and used all of his strength to keep up. Xiao Yulan evidently did not wish for Xiao Chen to participate in this and dashed ahead at great speed with every intent to leave him behind.However, Xiao Yulan was afraid of drawing the attention of the person in blue, thus she did not use her Essence. Although she moved fast, it was only due to the strength of her body. With that alone, it would be difficult to leave behind Xiao Chen.Ten minutes later.Xiao Yulan was flabbergasted at the sounds of Xiao Chen rushing over. Although she did not use any Essence, her cultivation was already in the realm of a Medial Grade Martial Master.The strength of her body should be vastly stronger than that of a person who had just condensed his Martial Spirit, which meant that leaving Xiao Chen behind in the dust should be a very easy thing to accomplish.Xiao Chen met Xiao Yulan\u2019s gaze and craftily spoke. \u201cCousin\u2019s speed is really fast, I nearly could not catch up with you.\u201dXiao Yulan understood what he meant by these words, replying with a solemn expression, \u201cthe cultivation of that person in blue has reached the realm of Martial Saint. It is best for cousin to not enter these troubled waters.\u201d\u201cIn front of a Martial Saint, there is no difference between a Martial Disciple and Martial Master. They would both die in one blow.\u201d Xiao Chen stated without backing down.Xiao Yulan\u2019s expression changed slightly, a slight amount of anger to her tone. \u201cI frequently cultivate on Seven Horn Mountain, so I am familiar with every tree and every blade of grass here. Even if I am no match for him, it would not be difficult for me to escape, cousin, but you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHush! They are about to go in, cousin, take a look.\u201d Xiao Chen interrupted Xiao Yulan\u2019s words and pointed in a direction.Xiao Yulan turned her head to take a look. There was a cliff in front. That person in blue just laughed coldly and threw out a fist on its stone wall. Cracks extended out from where that person punched the wall, spreading in all directions, and the cracks kept getting larger and larger, with pieces of rocks continuously falling off the cliff.When all the rocks finished falling, it revealed a hidden stone door. With a loud rumble, the door opened automatically. Elder Zhang flattered the person in blue and left behind someone to guard the entrance before entering with the person in blue.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d When Xiao Chen finished saying that, he did not bother himself with Xiao Yulan and led the way forward.The Zhang Clan disciple stationed outside was only a Medial Grade Martial Disciple. Xiao Chen hid himself in a place about a hundred meters from the stone door, confirming that the person in blue had moved far away.Xiao Chen used his consciousness to control the Essence to move towards the meridians in his legs, to which the Azure Dragon within his body opened its eyes once again. Only this time, the expression in its eyes were not clear and pure like earlier, but it was now filled with a baleful look.It was as though it felt Xiao Chen\u2019s intentions. The three white clouds floated around gently, and two streams of even purer Essence spat out from its mouth, heading toward the meridians in Xiao Chen\u2019s legs.After the two streams of Essences trickled into Xiao Chen\u2019s legs, he could feel strength brimming within them, as though they were able to flatten the solid Seven Horn Mountain with one stomp!Kill!There was a loud shout, and Xiao Chen\u2019s right foot ferociously pushed off from the ground, leaving behind a two feet deep footprint. His body left the ground and covered the distance of a hundred meters in an instant, the Purple Thunder True Fire burning in his palm.The Zhang Clan disciple guarding the entrance only heard a loud shout before a purple flame had already hit his chest. Before he had the time to shout, his whole chest was already burnt up. A black hole occupied the middle of his chest, only for its size to rapidly expand shortly after. Within moments, this Martial Disciple had been turned into a pile of ashes.What a domineering flame\u2014looking at the Zhang Clan disciple, Xiao Yulan sighed. \u201cThis is your Martial Spirit?\u201dXiao Chen did not deny it and smiled, \u201ccousin, do you now believe that I have the ability to protect myself?\u201dXiao Yulan bent over\u00a0and dipped her fingers in the ashes. After she examined it, she shook her head and proceeded to explain. \u201cThis flame is indeed domineering, but it is not as powerful as you think. If this Martial Disciple was not suddenly ambushed and could not defend himself in time, as long as he released his Essence, he would be able to defend against these flames.\u201dXiao Chen, who was seen through, awkwardly smiled and avoided the topic, \u201cthey should have already made it far away. If we follow them from a distance, given the large size of this cave, we might not even run into them.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xiao Chen seemed to have made up his mind to follow her inside. She felt slightly suspicious in her heart, considering this version of Xiao Chen seemed different from the rumors.After going past the stone door, there was a long paved tunnel, and along the tunnel, between every few meters, one could find an inlaid Night Pearl lining the walls. Due to the luminance of the Night Pearl, the tunnel was not steeped in complete darkness.The both of them proceeded forward, walking silently in the quiet tunnel, the atmosphere a little sinister. Xiao Chen wanted to find something to talk about to lighten the mood, but he was not able to initiate conversation when he saw the indifferent expression on Xiao Yulan\u2019s face.Right when Xiao Chen could bear it no longer and wanted to say something, the road in front of them ended, a thick stone wall blocking their path. However, there was a fork in the tunnel, with two roads to each\u00a0their\u00a0side.Xiao Chen took a look at both sides, observing that the tunnels did not have any Night Pearls to illuminate the darkness. He could not clearly see the situation further in, so Xiao Chen inquired: \u201cCousin Yulan, which way should we go?\u201dXiao Yulan took a look at both sides and spoke. \u201cThere are obvious signs of footprints on the left side, that should be the direction the person in blue went,\u00a0we take the right side.\u201dXiao Yulan took out a flare\u00a0and lead the way, \u201cthis place could be the cave of a predecessor, so try not to wander around on your own. There usually are some kind of restrictions in this kind of place.\u201d[TL notes: This flare is not actually the flare we know. It is actually some kind of ancient Chinese lighter made out of some kind of paper and embers kept in a tube]Cave of a predecessor\u2014when Xiao Chen heard that, his interest was immediately piqued. Indeed, that person in blue would not come to Seven Horn Mountain for no reason. He had followed them to the right place. Since it was the cave of a predecessor, then there would definitely be treasures.Xiao Yulan saw Xiao Chen\u2019s expression and knew that he did not take her words to heart, laughing coldly.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t be so naive. Since this place can attract a Martial Saint cultivator, then the predecessor must have been at least a Martial King. Any one of the restrictions here could easily kill you.Xiao Chen smiled. \u201cI still have cousin here. As long as I follow you, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201dXiao Yulan wore a cold expression and did not say anything. After they traveled for a certain distance, it brightened up, revealing a stone room in front of them.Xiao Yulan put out the flare and carefully sized it up. The area of the stone room was not spacious, in the middle was a stone table and a stone stool, and it was surrounded by smooth walls. Above the room was a large number of Night Pearls that formed the strange image of a bird.Xiao Yulan focused her attention on the stone table, spotting an unopened red embroidered box on it. The strange image of the bird was painted onto the box as well. Xiao Yulan found this image to be very familiar, but she could not recall what it was.Thunder Roc!After thinking for a long time, Xiao Yulan finally remembered the name of this bird, the Thunder Roc. This Thunder Roc was the Martial Spirit of the Martial Emperor Sang Mu, who was known as the Thunder Emperor a thousand years ago. Legends have it that Sang Mu was born into an ordinary family, meaning his parents were not cultivators. But he was born with the Thunder Roc Martial Spirit innately inside him, and he even went so far as to reach the peak of Martial Saint before he turned twenty.The battle that led him to become famous was the God Sealing Battle that was organized by the Ten Powers Alliance of the Tianwu Continent. At the age of twenty, without the backing of any sects or clans, he defeated countless geniuses of the various sects single-handedly. This was when the name of Thunder Emperor began to spread.In the few years that followed, he was like a bright comet. He battled Martial Kings, destroyed Martial Monarchs, and killed Martial Emperors. His name could be heard everywhere in the great continent, and many people claimed that he was the youngest Martial God in the history of the Tianwu Continent. It was only later that he slowly faded away from view.Hearing Xiao Yulan describe the history of the owner of this cave, Xiao Chen started to get excited. \u201cNo one knows if he finally managed to successfully break through to become a Martial God,\u00a0the answers to this question might be within this box.\u201dXiao Yulan saw that Xiao Chen was about to go and open the embroidered box, hurriedly speaking, \u201cDon\u2019t make any careless moves, the box is a little strange\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2026...Within the stone room.The person in blue saw the embroidered box on the table and the picture on the ceiling and also guessed the identity of the owner of this cave. Smiling, he said: \u201cSo, it is the cave of Thunder Emperor Sang Mu. Before Sang Mu went missing, he already had the cultivation of a Martial Emperor. Looks like this trip was not wasted.\u201dElder Zhang also laughed as well. \u201cSince it is so, then with regards to the matter that senior had promised, don\u2019t forget to fulfill it when the time comes.\u201dThe mood of the person in blue was extremely good. He boldly laughed and gave his word. \u201cJust a small Xiao Clan of Mohe City. My Leng Clan does not think much of them. If I can obtain an Earth Ranked Technique or Spirit Weapon, I would give you an additional surprise.\u201dElder Zhang laughed. \u201cThe Xiao Clan is naturally not the Leng Clan\u2019s match. In that case, senior, how shall we open this embroidered box?\u201dThe person in blue snorted coldly. Given the strength of Martial Emperor Sang Mu, he definitely would have left behind some restrictions on this embroidered box. Even with his Martial Saint cultivation, if he rashly opened it, he would also get hit by the backlash from the restrictions. Taking a look at the group of Zhan Clan cultivators, the person in blue laughed strangely.\u201cElder Zhang, get the group of cultivators behind you to open this embroidered box. With me behind, I guarantee that nothing will happen to them.Elder Zhang\u2019s complexion changed. However, he quickly recovered, \u201csince senior has asked, then there naturally is no problems. You! Quickly open this box.\u201dThe Zhang Clan cultivator who was pointed out quickly displayed an expression of horror, stammering, \u201cGreat\u2026 Elder, I, I, I \u2026\u2026\u201dElder Zhang\u2019s expression changed, anger clear in his voice. \u201cAre you not going to follow my instructions? Have you forgotten the Clan Rules?When the Zhang Clan cultivator heard the words \u2018Clan Rules\u2019, his expression turn unsightly. He walked up front hesitatingly, closing his eyes and stretching his hands out to touch the box.\u201cChi!\u201dWhen the Zhang Clan cultivator touched the box, the Thunder Roc on the box seemed to come to life and flapped its wings, shooting out a bolt of lightning from the box. Before the Zhang Clan Cultivator could activate his Essence to protect himself, he was zapped until charred.The person in blue completely disregarded the Zhang Clan disciple and just quickly stretched out his right hand to grab the embroidered box. A stream of solid rocks extended from his shoulder to his palms, very soon covering his entire arm in rocks.He gently opened the box without suffering any damage, finding within the embroidered box a black book, a Martial Technique manual to be specific.The person in blue impatiently took it out and flipped through it but quickly lost interest after taking a couple of looks at it. This was just a Superior Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique; it was not worth much even in the Great Qin Nation. Finding it insignificant to his use, he simply threw it over to Elder Zhang while explaining. \u201cElder Zhang, this is a Superior Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique. I don\u2019t need this, so you can have it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he had yet to stop breathing, there was a chance to save him. The only consolation he felt was when he heard the person in blue say that he was going to give him a Superior Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique.He got very excited. Even in the entire Zhang Clan, only two or three copies of a Superior Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique was in their possession. It would be worth it even if that Zhang Clan disciple died.Elder Zhang received it and smiled. \u201cMany thanks to senior. Should we turn back and take another path?\u201dThe person in blue shook his head. \u201cThere is no need, the road on the right will probably lead to the same destination, the exit is definitely within this stone room.\u201dWhen the person in blue ended his statement, he carefully inspected the entire stone room, sweeping his eyes across the four walls before finally resting his gaze on the wall in front of the table. A hunch told him that the exit should be located in front of them, but he was simply not familiar with these strange mechanisms. If he wanted to find a switch by chance, it would be very difficult.Since he could not do it that way, then he would do it the hard way! The person in blue began to speak in a deep voice: \u201cMove aside, I am going to pierce through this stone wall.\u201dWhen a Martial Saint expert took action, it was difficult to avoid any casualties. When the surrounding people heard what he said, they hurriedly hid behind him. Shortly after, the rocks appeared on the right arm of the person in blue again.The rocks were moving around strangely on the arm of the person in blue, in fact slowly embedding into his skin, leaving behind a small gray line that seemed to move towards his palm like a poisonous snake.When that line arrived at the palm, it formed a spiral and continuously rotated. A terrifying energy seemed to blast out from his palms, after which he immediately jumped up and quickly struck out, his palm hitting the stone wall in front.\u201cRumble\u2026\u2026!\"The entire stone room shook continuously. There were plenty of stone fragments continuously falling down as well. With a bang, the stone wall in front was blasted apart, revealing a hole large enough for two men to enter.The person in blue withdrew his hand. Looking at the hole in front, he indifferently said: \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAlthough the person in blue said to go, he did not make a move. Elder Zhang couldn\u2019t help but call him an old fox in his heart, but, at this moment, he could not afford to offend him. He led the members of the Zhang Clan and entered the hole.After going through the hole, the viewing range in front widened, opening up to reveal to their eyes a vast stone platform\u00a0further ahead. When he raised his head to look at the ceiling, he measured it to be somewhere around a hundred meters high. There was a stone pillar in the middle of the stone platform, the faint radiance glowing off of it attracting all of their gazes.\u201cMoonstone!\u201d\u201cWhat a big piece of Moonstone!\u201dThat glowing stone pillar was actually carved out of a large piece of Moonstone. Damn it, what a waste, he actually used Moonstone to carve a pillar. Each and every one of them reprimanded exactly this in their hearts.In the Tianwu Continent, Moonstones were quite rare, and the few locations that had Moonstone quarries were already confirmed to have dried up many years ago.With such a large piece of Moonstone, they could forge a countless amount of Spirit Weapons. If they used the entire piece and mixed it with some other rare materials, it would even be possible to make a Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon. Due to the scarcity of Moonstones, the Tianwu Continent had not seen any Heaven Grade Spirit Weapon in hundreds of years.Not only the person in blue, but everyone in the Zhang Clan would wish to obtain it. When they thought about the value of this pillar made of Moonstones, they could not help but swallow their saliva. However, the gaze of the person in blue was not completely focused on the pillar. He noticed an exposed sword hilt at the top of the pillar.That should be the sword hilt of a Spirit Weapon,\u00a0a Spirit Weapon that was inserted into the Moonstone. What rank was this Spirit Weapon? Earth Ranked? Definitely not, it was at the very least a Superior Grade Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon, and it might even be a legendary Divine Weapon. When the person in blue thought of this, his blood began to boil.However, when he thought of the owner of the cave, the person in blue immediately calmed down.\u201cYou guys, go in front and check out the situation. After this matter is over, I will reward you guys will 500 taels of gold each.\u201dUnder the promise of a great reward, the morale of the Zhang Clan disciples was raised tremendously. They all condensed a protective barrier and walked towards that stone pillar carefully. When they were about fifty meters away from the stone pillar, a faint yellow barrier suddenly appeared. It blocked their passage as though it was a wall, and even their vision seemed to be blurred.Regardless of how hard they tried, the few Martial Disciples could not press forward. They used their Martial Techniques to smash against the thin barrier. In an instant, many Martial Techniques flew at it.\u201cKa! Ka! Ka!\u201dWhen the Martial Techniques struck the thin barrier, they were actually reflected back at the crowd, their speed and might increased by a fold. In an instant, the Zhang Clan disciples were all struck by their own techniques,\u00a0causing them to fall to the ground and cry out\u00a0in agony.With this sudden unforeseen turn of events, the Zhang Clan disciples all immediately became afraid. This yellow barrier was too weird, and the other Zhang Clan disciples who had yet to go up did not know what to do.The expression of the person in blue did not change, as though he had expected such a scenario. He slowly walked to the front and placed his hands on the yellow barrier. A wave of Essence extended from his palms onto the barrier, his consciousness controlling the Essence to move around on it. After a long period of time, he understood what to do.The Essence in his body quickly circulated, and even more Essence came out of his palm, like tiny snakes swimming about on the thin barrier. When he saw that the barrier was completely covered with his Essence, he stopped supplying it and used his consciousness to control the tiny strands of Essences to tightly stick to the barrier.\u201cWithdraw!\u201dThe person in blue shouted softly, and the Essence that was stuck on the barrier started to flow back. The thin yellow barrier started to shake, after which a tiny hole the size of the eye of a needle appeared on the thin barrier. The person in blue felt joy in his heart and used his left hand to wipe the sweat off his forehead.\u201cElder Zhang, this thin barrier is the restriction left behind by that predecessor. Based on my strength alone, I can only open a hole the size of one person. Remember to get your men to move faster.\u201dIn the stone room that Xiao Chen was in.A horrifying electrical current shot out from the Thunder Roc on that embroidered box, hitting and catching Xiao Chen off guard. The electricity traveled through his fingertips into his body, the devastating energy frantically filling his meridians without any restraint. The Essence in his body attempted to resist the invasion of this lightning, but it immediately dissipated when they came into contact.The horrifying energy traveled up Xiao Chen\u2019s arms through his meridians, rapidly heading toward the Dantian. Xiao Chen was startled\u2026...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If this terrifying bolt of lightning were to strike his Martial Spirit, something he had condensed with great difficulty, it might be smashed to pieces. He might truly turn into trash forever.However, all of a sudden, something strange occurred. The Azure Dragon in his Dantian opened its mouth wide and swallowed up the lightning that was rampaging about within his meridians. The lightning rumbled ceaselessly around it, but the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit did not sustain any injuries at all.This scene caused Xiao Chen to feel that it was incomparably\u00a0weird.\u00a0Could his cultivation of the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation have caused a mutation in the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit that allows it to absorb electricity?\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, are you alright?\u201d Xiao Yulan asked worriedly. She felt guilty as this might not have happened had she warned him earlier.The electrical energy within his body began to disperse, leaving behind injured meridians that hadn't sustained any major damage in its wake, which Xiao Chen could repair before long. \u201cI\u2019m fine... that lightning may have seemed frightening, but it did not contain much energy. Cousin\u00a0Yulan, you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dXiao Yulan did not seem to believe him. She held Xiao Chen\u2019s wrist to check his\u00a0meridians, heaving a relieved breath shortly after. However, she felt suspicious. The lightning did not seem as simple as Xiao Chen had described it, but she would be unable to find an answer anytime soon.Xiao Chen smiled: \u201cCousin, don\u2019t think too much, let\u2019s see what\u2019s in this embroidered box.\u201dXiao Yulan put down the Suspicions in her heart and took out the thing inside the box. She spoke only after looking at it for a while. \u201cThis is a Superior Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique. It\u2019s a pity that it is lightning-attributed.\u201dA lightning-attributed Superior Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique,\u00a0of all things\u2014this was a treasure that was now delivered to his\u00a0hands\u00a0on a silver platter. He had just condensed his Martial Spirit and had not practiced any Martial Technique yet. The main attribute of his Azure Dragon Martial Spirit was that of wood,\u00a0but\u00a0after cultivating the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation, this Azure Dragon seemed to have gained some lightning attributes.\u201cCousin, can you give me this Martial Technique to practice?\u201d Xiao Chen said.Xiao Yulan nodded her head in response: \u201cI intended to give this to you. It's just that... this Martial Technique is lightning-attributed whereas your Martial Spirit is fire-attributed, so its power might decrease.\u201dXiao Chen received the Martial Technique Secret Manual and smiled: \u201cThat\u2019s not a problem, I still have not learned any Martial Techniques. If I can learn one, then it is one more I know.\u201dSuperior Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique\u00a0Divine Thunder Break. After successfully training in it, one could release a blast of electrical energy. Xiao Chen circulated his Essence according to the Martial Technique Manual, and\u00a0an\u00a0electrical energy gathered onto his right hand. He was very content with this technique. He hurriedly stopped training it, for it was not yet the time to test it out.\u201cCousin Yulan, should we return or proceed forward?\u201d Xiao Chen asked. He had already obtained a Superior Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique and was satisfied, but if they continued on, they might run into some other dangers.Xiao Yulan ignored Xiao Chen\u2019s statement and continued to search around every corner of the four walls. After a while, she spoke up:\u00a0\u201cLooks like we have to go back. After searching for such a long time, I am still unable to find the secret passage of this stone room.\u201dThis aligned with Xiao Chen\u2019s original intentions. He put away the Martial Technique Manual in a safe place and smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s go, this place is very strange. Let's not wait for anything to happen.\u201dWho knew, when Xiao Chen finished saying that, the stone table in the stone room started to move,\u00a0slowly moving in an anticlockwise motion. Xiao Yulan gripped her sword and alertly watched the table turn. When the table stopped turning, the stone wall on the right side suddenly revealed a stone door.Xiao Chen wanted to slap himself. Right when he said that this place was strange, this strange thing occurred. Xiao Yulan lit up her firestarter and threw it forward. She discovered that aside from a tunnel, there was nothing else. After hesitating for a while, Xiao Yulan slowly followed the tunnel and descended, leaving Xiao Chen with no other choice than to follow her.\u201cHey! Cousin, why did you follow me down? Didn\u2019t you say that you didn\u2019t want to go?\u201d Xiao Yulan gently smiled.Xiao Chen scratched his head. \u201cI followed you to take a look, and the road is not blocked, so it should be simple to turn back and return.\u201d\u201cRumble\u2026\u2026!\u201dAs though it was answering Xiao Chen\u2019s words, the hole behind them was sealed shut. It almost drove him mad the instant it happened\u2014how uncanny!Seeing Xiao Chen\u2019s depressed visage, Xiao Yulan found it funny, \u201cAlright, since the road is sealed shut now, you can\u2019t turn back either.\u201dXiao Chen smiled\u00a0bitterly: \u201cLet\u2019s hope that there is an exit ahead.\u201dThey traveled in silence. After a certain distance, their field of vision abruptly widened, and a huge stone platform appeared in front of their eyes.The Moonstone pillar in the middle of the stone platform immediately caught their\u00a0attention. From the memories of this body, Xiao Chen could imagine the immense value of this Moonstone. However, they soon noticed the Zhang Clan members behind the thin yellow barrier.Xiao Chen\u2019s appearance caused the person in blue to become anxious. At this moment, the thin yellow barrier was only the size of half a person. While a regular person would not be able to squeeze in, he could not help but feel apprehensive.\u201cElder Zhang, quickly go in, the cultivation of those two are at most Martial Master. We absolutely cannot let them snatch away the Spirit Weapon on the Moonstone.\u201dElder Zhang knew that the matter was urgent. He took two steps back and ferociously leaped forward, like a carp leaping through water. His body athletically went through the hole that was about the size of a wash basin. After he landed, he somersaulted and immediately stood up.The cultivation of Elder Zhang had already reached the peak of Martial Grand Master long ago. A Martial Grand Master had the capability to easily kill tens of Martial Masters, and what more with Elder Zhang\u2019s peak Martial Grand Master cultivation, killing them would be very simple.Elder Zhang slowly walked over and clearly saw their appearances, smiling. \u201cI was wondering who it was, so it is the Second Young Master of the Xiao Clan and the granddaughter of the Xiao Clan\u2019s First Elder.Xiao Yulan stepped forward and gave a preemptive explanation: \u201cWe are not interested in snatching away this\u00a0Moonstone, we merely got trapped when we tried to return. Since you are aware of our identities, please let us go.\u201dXiao Chen perspired heavily\u2014this cousin of his indeed had a strong cultivation, but her brain seemed to have short-circuited. The Xiao Clan and Zhang Clan had been enemies for a long time. Furthermore, if he killed the both of them here, the rest of the world would be none the wiser. Even without the Moonstone, this Elder Zhang would not have let them go.Indeed, Elder Zhang just laughed aloud: \u201cLittle girl, you are so naive. you think that I\u2026\u2026 You actually dared to sneak attack me? How foolish!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A red flower the size of a person had risen up behind him unnoticed, and its color was incomparably beautiful with countless of pollen falling gently from the petals.The toxic plant, Poinsettia!Xiao Yulan\u2019s Martial Spirit was actually the Poinsettia, which was one of the five deadly poisons. As long as it drew blood, it would be a fatal strike, and its pollen could affect the nerves, effectively paralyzing someone without any signs and causing their battle prowess to significantly decrease. If the poisoned individual had an open wound and the pollen entered said gap in the body, the poisoned individual would likely die within ten breaths.Xiao Chen did not expect Xiao Yulan\u2019s Martial Spirit to be\u00a0the\u00a0Poinsettia, nor did he anticipate for her to have\u00a0schemed so deeply. No one would have thought that a Martial Master would make the first move against a peak Martial Grand Master. Furthermore, this Martial Master looked like a sweet little girl.A cultivator was at their weakest in the period of time when the Martial Spirit had left their body. When Xiao Chen saw that red flower crop up all of a sudden, he immediately understood what to do and made the first move as well.A purple flame condensed with a flicker on his palm. Circulating Essence to his legs, Xiao Chen bent his legs and abruptly dashed forward, generating a sound as he tore through the air before striking Elder Zhang with his palm.In the instant the pollen invaded his body, Elder Zhang sought to kill Xiao Yulan first before she had the chance to activate Poinsettia\u2019s poisonous nature. He may have appeared to be cornered in that position, but when he saw Xiao Chen flying over, the corners of his mouth curled up to reveal a cold smile. This brat was merely a junior in the Martial Disciple Realm, yet he dared to take action against him.He split apart a portion of the Essence that was suppressing Poensettia\u2019s poison and struck out against Xiao Chen\u2019s palm. Xiao Chen was blasted backwards in the aftermath, because the punch of a Martial Grand Master was not something that he was able to withstand at present. Vomiting a mouthful of fresh blood, he could vaguely sense that his heart or lungs might have sustained damage.Elder Zhang did not even bother to look at Xiao Chen, who had been blasted back. He was about to make another move when he discovered that the flame from Xiao Chen\u2019s palm was still sticking to his fist and was continuously consuming the Essence he had condensed on it. He was alarmed... what a domineering flame! Quickly allocating another portion of Essence to surround the flames, he applied firm control over the Essence with his consciousness and had to tightly clench his fist before he could put out the flames.Xiao Yulan took advantage of this opportunity to successfully retrieve the Martial Spirit that had left her body. Seeing Xiao Chen vomit blood, killing intent began to pool in her eyes. She drew her sword and stared coldly at Elder Zhang without any emotions showing on her face, as though he was already a dead man in her eyes.\u201cInferior Grade Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon, Broken Moon Sword, I did not expect the only Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon of the Xiao Clan to be in your hands. Looks like you definitely have to die today.\u201d Looking at the sword in Xiao Yulan\u2019s hands, Elder Zhang was astonished.Xiao Yulan held the sword in her hands, and a dance of petals in the breeze around her was swiftly followed by a sword flash flying towards Elder Zhang. Elder Zhang did not dare to take any risk as he disbursed half of his Essence into his hands and feet, using the other half to stave off the poison.The two of them began to move faster and faster. Initially, Xiao Chen, who was lying on the ground, could clearly see the battle between them. Soon, he could only see blurry shadows amidst the plentiful petals. This level of battle was no longer something that he could take part in, and he never expected that Xiao Yulan\u2019s speed was actually this impressive. Despite the difference in cultivation realms, she was able to fight evenly with Elder Zhang.Xiao Chen shifted his gaze away and looked at the sword hilt that was located on top of the Moonstone pillar. This Spirit Weapon was probably the object of their desire, so he decided to grab it before they could.Xiao Chen slowly stood up and cautiously walked towards the stone pillar.When the person in blue, who was doing his best to widen the hole in the thin barrier, saw Xiao Chen heading towards the Moonstone pillar, he felt anxious in his heart. Yet, he could not make a single move. He loudly shouted: \u201cElder Zhang, you trash! You can\u2019t even deal with two little kids! If I am not able to get my hands on this Spirit Weapon, after we get back, you will be the first person I kill.\u201dElder Zhang, who was currently fighting with Xiao Yu Lan, found it difficult to talk about his troubles. The Spirit Weapon of this girl was incredibly strange, as it surrounded him with flower petals that made him incapable of exhibiting more than half of his usual combat ability. Furthermore, at this moment, he had to hold his breath, not daring to breathe. Let alone that, with Poinsettia\u2019s poison, he was only able to utilize about a quarter of his strength as a peak Martial Grand Master.When he heard the words of the person in blue, Elder Zhang hardened his heart. When Xiao Yulan pierced her sword at him, he did not dodge, instead punching out at her\u00a0temple\u00a0with precise purpose. This girl wanted to fight with him so badly it seemed, suffering heavy injuries to try to get him to bleed, to activate Poinsettia\u2019s fatal poison. She was treating it as though he had no way to force out the poison.Just when Elder Zhang\u2019s fist was about to land, Xiao Yulan twisted her body in midair, creating two more Xiao Yulans that looked exactly the same. The one he struck immediately became countless scattered red petals.Elder Zhang was not surprised. He smiled and roared shortly after exposing her flaws, \u201cThis should be your trump card, Inferior Grade Profound Ranked Martial Technique, Flower Clones. However, it is time to end this farce\u2014Beast Soul Possession!\u201dA phantom image of an ape appeared behind Elder Zhang\u2019s body. In a flash, Elder Zhang turned into some kind of human-ape monster. This was the ability of Martial Grand Masters, Martial Soul Possession.After the Martial Spirit possessed the body, one\u2019s speed and strength would increase by several folds. Sometimes, someone would even obtain the special abilities of their Martial Spirit.Elder Zhang used his right hand, which had extended its length by an additional half, and clenched his fist in midair. A bolt of lightning struck one of Xiao Yulan\u2019s clones, turning it into a scatter of red petals with a loud boom.Laughing weirdly, Elder Zhang jumped like an ape and extended his two arms, grabbing at the last clone.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe last clone was also shattered into countless red petals. Within an instant, the surrounding space became filled with the Red Poinsettia petals. Elder Zhang was overwhelmed with amazement and looked behind him, spotting another seven clones behind him amidst dancing petals.Elder Zhang appeared to be flustered and mumbled: \u201cThat's not possible, even the highest realm of Flower Clones can only create ten clones. Given your age, how could you have trained to that realm?\u201dXiao Yulan coldly said: \u201cBeast Soul Possession, this requires all the Essence in your body to be activated. The poison of my Poinsettia should have taken effect by now, it\u2019s over.\u201dSeven shadows came flying in from different directions, and the slender Broken Moon Sword merged together with the petals, intertwining with each other. Without Elder Zhang\u2019s Essence to restrict it, Poinsettia\u2019s poison started to work on his nerves, causing his limbs to twitch,\u201cPuchi!\u201dThe seven shadows merged back together into Xiao Yulan as she appeared behind Elder Zhang\u2019s back. The petals were dancing behind her as the Broken Moon Sword streaked across his back, inflicting a hideous wound. As blood flowed from it, Poinsettia\u2019s poison completely came into effect, sentencing Elder Zhang to certain death within ten breaths of time.However, just at this moment, Elder Zhang suddenly turned around and grabbed the Broken Moon Sword with his hands.\u201cEven if I die, I will drag you down with me!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The full force of a Martial Grand Master struck her shoulder heavily and sent her flying back toward the stone pillar.Xiao Chen, who was preparing to draw the Spirit Weapon, was startled, hurriedly catching Xiao Yulan, \u201cCousin, are you alright?\u201dXiao Yulan\u2019s face was pale as she spoke somewhat weakly, \u201cQuickly run, that man in blue is about to open up the hole.\u201dHe carried Xiao Yulan on his back, turned his head to see the man in blue anxiously trying to break through that thin yellow barrier, and then looked once again at the Spirit Weapon on the Moonstone pillar.Even if he tried to return back through the route from which they came, he would not be able to break open that stone wall with his current strength. It would only be a path to death. If he pulled out the Spirit Weapon, who knows, maybe he could use the strength of the Spirit Weapon to help carve a path out, making his escape easy.Xiao Chen stopped hesitating. He took two steps forward and gripped the sword handle. He tugged firmly at it, but to his surprise, it came out with incomparable ease. However, this Spirit Weapon did not seem like a divine weapon. And upon closer inspection, it was actually just a meter-long broken sword.Before he had time to curse, the Moonstone pillar exploded apart with a loud boom and turned into numerous fragments. Xiao Chen reacted quickly and grabbed at some of the fragments with his hands before falling downwards. After the Moonstone pillar exploded, the stone platform below them was destroyed too, thus Xiao Chen had fallen down, together with Xiao Yulan, who he was carrying.\u201cNo!\u201d Seeing the Spirit Weapon snatched from right under his nose and the Moonstone pillar breaking into pieces, the man in blue shouted out loudly. That thin yellow barrier suddenly seemed to emit a great repelling force, causing the man in blue to be blasted out. The hole in the barrier rapidly mended itself.The man in blue had been watching as all these things played out all of a sudden. He felt unresigned, vomited blood, and then fainted!In a narrow stone room, Xiao Yulan closed her eyes as she leaned back on the wall. Her complexion was very pale as she kept murmuring in a low voice. Xiao Chen frowned and looked at the hole about ten meters above them, at a loss for what to do.\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, am I dying?\u201d Xiao Yulan opened her eyes and inquired weakly. She had been struck by Elder Zhang\u2019s strongest technique earlier. The punch of a peak Martial Grand Master augmented by the Reckless Heavy Punch Martial Technique had such an enormous force behind it that it almost shattered all her meridians. Even worse, the Martial Spirit in her body had no way to treat this damage.Xiao Chen walked over, sat down by her side, and smiled: \u201cStop talking nonsense cousin and rest well. This pit is only about ten meters deep, so I will think of a way to get us out as soon as possible.\u201dWhen Xiao Yulan heard that, a bitter smile appeared on her pale face, \u201cIf you are able to leave, then leave by yourself, you don\u2019t have to bother with me. Since the day I was born, I have been destined to bring misfortune to the people around me... I should have died long ago.\u201dXiao Chen smiled, \u201cStop saying silly things, there is no way I will abandon you here. As long as I am alive, I will not let you die.\u201dThere was not a single trace of redness on Xiao Yulan\u2019s face, and her lips parted in a murmur: \u201cDon\u2019t you think that it was strange that I was cultivating alone on Seven Horn Mountain all this time?\u201d[Tl notes: The author is not trying to say that Xiao Yulan did not feel anything, he was trying to express that she is now anemic, probably due to loss of blood]\u201cIt is indeed strange, but everyone has their own secrets to hide. I don\u2019t think it is good to dig into the secrets of others.\u201d Xiao Chen squinted while pursing his lips.\u201cWhen I was five years old, I had already condensed my Martial Soul. I remember the horrified expression on my father\u2019s face. I was very young back then, so I could not understand why and I only felt that the flower in my body was very pretty.\u201d\u201cI used to have an elder sister. I did not understand the situation then and showed Poinsettia to her. After she got poisoned by it, she fell down and suffered an injury that made her bleed... thus, she was poisoned to death by me like this. Ever since then, I finally understood why my father did not like me. I am poisonous; the bowls and cups that I used to use, even the stool that I sat on, have to be cleaned multiple times.\u201d\u201cI could not even play with the other children. Cousin Xiao Chen, do you remember? We used to play house together when we were young, but when my Martial Soul appeared, my father forbade me from playing with the others. I was very upset and would often hide somewhere to cry. When I was eight years old, my father sent me to Seven Horn Mountain to cultivate. Ever since then, I\u2019ve never left the mountain\u2026 and on occasion, my father sends some things up the mountain to me.\u201dXiao Yulan spoke very slowly, as though she was reminiscing about the distant past. Her pale smile suddenly brightened, \u201cI rarely meet people on the mountain. When I first met cousin, I actually did not recognize you and even injured you. I was very afraid then, afraid that you would call me a freak. You have no idea\u2026\u2026 all these years, I have been killing all these Spirit Beasts on the mountain, and there were many times where even I thought that I was a freak.\u201dXiao Chen felt grief in his heart, abruptly interrupting her, \u201cCousin Yulan, you are not a freak. You are very pretty, so much more so than the girls below the mountain. A freak would not give me a bottle of medicine to treat my wounds.\u201dA trace of redness appeared on Xiao Yulan\u2019s pale face, but she wasn\u2019t fully convinced, \u201creally?\u201dXiao Chen replied seriously, \u201cReally. Cousin, stop speaking for now, have a good rest first.\u201dPerhaps she believed Xiao Chen\u2019s words or maybe she was very tired, but Xiao Yulan slowly closed her eyes as her breathing became calm and even. Xiao Chen raised his head to gain a visual of the hole above them, shaking his head helplessly as he took out the broken sword.There was a faint glow on the body of this azure sword. Xiao Chen held the handle and brandished it, waving it around for a while. He could not feel any strong might emitting from the sword, and even infusing it with Essence yielded no reaction.Could this just be an ordinary sword? Xiao Chen felt a little dispirited and put away the sword. Afterwards, he took out the Moonstone he grabbed by chance and grinned wide, because at least this Moonstone was not fake. With such a large piece, it would not be a problem to exchange this for a hundred thousand taels of gold.However, the critical problem now was a way out, and a ten meters pit was not something an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple could jump out of just like that. Even with Xiao Yulan\u2019s cultivation, it would not be possible. Furthermore, her meridians were currently injured, rendering her incapable of using her Essence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Looking pale as a ghost, her murmurs appeared to have no end in sight. But at the end of the day, considering Xiao Chen had been a shut-in his entire life without much contact to women prior to his \u2018ascension\u2019, he was at a loss to what to do. \u00a0Had it been otherwise, this kind of situation should not have disconcerted him as much as it did.Xiao Chen cultivated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation, which was, despite its tyrannical nature, still a legitimate Immortal Cultivation Technique. However, it had one major drawback in this world. \u00a0There was simply no Immortal Qi in this world. Even so, if he used his Essence, it would definitely have\u00a0a trace of\u00a0a similar healing effect to the Immortal Qi. Xiao Chen had also received a punch from Elder Zhang earlier and injured his heart and lungs, but it took merely a bit of nourishing by Essence before it was completely healed.It was definitely effective. He decided to give it a try when he had thought of this idea.\u00a0He then slowly straightened out Xiao Yulan\u2019s body and placed his hand on her shoulder, and circulated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation, threads of gentle Essence slowly pouring into Xiao Yulan\u2019s body through his palm and fingers.His consciousness followed the Essence closely and entered into Xiao Yulan\u2019s meridians, but all that lay in store for him was shock as he saw how severely her meridians had been damaged. There were scars of varying sizes in the eight major meridians, and they had many gorges and were very distorted in shape. Some of the minor meridians were only connected to each other by a thread, seeming to be on the verge of snapping apart at any moment. It was a shocking sight.Xiao Chen carefully controlled the Essence and nourished the injured meridians. The nourishing sensation seemed to placate Xiao Yulan\u2019s pained expression, which began to regain color. She could feel a certain warmth moving gently around in her meridians, inordinately amazing her. As she knew Xiao Chen was the one treating her, a tinge of red pervaded her face.Xiao Chen used his consciousness to control the Essence in Xiao Yulan\u2019s body, making it circulate a whole cycle before sending his consciousness even deeper. The scars seemed to have recovered significantly everywhere he went. He controlled his Essence to head towards Xiao Yulan\u2019s Dantian, where a beautiful Poinsettia resided. Right now, it seemed dispirited and listless, as though it was withered.\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, that\u2019s enough.\u201dThe voice suddenly entered his brain, startling Xiao Chen. It took a long time for him to react. This was the sound of Xiao Yulan\u2019s consciousness speaking directly to him. Immediately after, he realized that he had not asked for her permission to send his consciousness into her. It was bad etiquette to enter another person\u2019s body in the way he did, even more-so if the counterpart was a girl.Xiao Chen withdrew his consciousness and Essence before getting up, but he felt dizzy and sat down again. He laughed bitterly, as it turned out that treating others was a very tiresome matter.Xiao Yulan asked worriedly: \u201cAre you alright, Cousin Xiao Chen?.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, don\u2019t worry, Cousin. I just exhausted a lot of my Essence. I will be fine after some rest. Are you feeling better yet?\u201d Xiao Chen stated.Xiao Yulan blushed and replied in a soft voice, \u201cThank you, Cousin Xiao Chen, I am feeling much better.\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s good. After a few more days of treatment, Cousin\u2019s injuries should be completely recovered.\u201dTime went by very fast in the stone room. In the blink of an eye, six days had already passed. The rations the two of them had taken with them had already been spent two days ago. Although it was not a big issue for Martial Cultivators to not eat or drink for a few days, if it went on for an extended period of time, they would still die.In these six days, Xiao Yulan\u2019s body had pretty much recovered all the way through. Despite that, her body still seemed a little weak due to lacking nourishment. Every day, after treating Xiao Yulan\u2019s injuries, Xiao Chen would cultivate. He was already able to freely use the Divine Thunder Break. He also raised the amount of Purple Thunder True Fire he could conjure and consolidated his Inferior Grade Martial Disciple cultivation.Today was the day of the duel with Xiao Jian. If he was not able to get out, there was no telling what sort of rumors would spread outside. He raised his head to look at the hole ten meters above them, feeling distraught and anxious.\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, can I take a look at the Spirit Weapon from the Moonstone pillar?\u201d Xiao Yulan asked weakly.Xiao Chen nodded his head. He took out the broken sword and handed it to Xiao Yulan, \u201cThis Spirit Weapon does not seem to be anything special. I have been trying for the past few days.\u201dXiao Yulan did not say anything. Instead, she caressed the body of the sword and took out a green thread and dropped\u00a0it onto the sword\u00a0slowly. When it touched the blade of the sword, it split into two pieces. Shortly after, she took out a short sword from below her feet and slashed it at the sword, the result thereupon being a resounding crashing sound! The short sword was immediately bisected into two roughly-cut pieces.\u201cIt cuts threads with just a touch and slices through metal like mud. This is no ordinary sword.\u201dXiao Chen smiled: \u201cEven so, it is not able to help us now. Unless it can help us fly up?\u201dXiao Yulan smiled gently: \u201cWho said it can't?\u201dXiao Chen only saw her leap up gently, rising about three meters up towards the top of the pit. Right as gravity picked up around her, she used the broken sword and struck it into the wall. The sword completely sank into the pit wall. Her right hand held onto the handle and, using that as a perch and propeller for momentum, her body found second wind in the air again. After a few renditions of this, she managed to escape the pit.Xiao Chen stood below, starting in shock. There was a clattering sound, generated as the sword made its way back down and hit the ground. Xiao Yulan shouted from up top, \u201cCousin, come up quickly, those people are gone already.\u201dXiao Chen picked up the broken sword, feeling excited. He imitated Xiao Yulan and, after a few jumps, managed to escape the pit as well. As a breeze of fresh air swept over him with a deep caress, Xiao Chen felt the urge to shout out loudly.For some reason, the body of the dead Elder Zhang did not rot. Xiao Chen could not care a whit about that and searched everywhere for any remaining broken pieces of Moonstone and collected them all.The two of them returned through the pathway they came from. With the assistance of the broken sword, the stone wall that had been in their way in the past was effortlessly slashed open. Before descending the mountain, Xiao Chen invited Xiao Yulan to come with him.Xiao Yulan hesitated for a while before accepting the invitation. After being trapped in there with Xiao Chen, she already knew that today was the day of the duel with Xiao Jian. She was a little worried about Xiao Chen and had decided to go down the mountain to take a look.Xiao Clan, martial hall.At this moment, the huge martial hall was already filled with people, indicating that all the disciples of the younger generation had come to watch. Because of the rumors spread by the servants, there were a significant amount of people.\u201cEldest Young Master, would this Xiao Chen not show up?\u201d A Xiao Clan disciple that had a good relationship with Xiao Jian spoke from below the arena in the martial hall.\u201cYes, I believe that Xiao Chen is too cowardly to show up. He\u2019s merely a piece of trash at the 9th grade of Spirit Refinement and actually dares to duel with the Eldest Young Master\u2014how insolent.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, he had a gloomy look on his face that made him seem extremely menacing. \u201cIt\u2019s best if he shows up, if he does not, then there will be no longer be a place for him in the Xiao Clan.\u201d\u201cIndeed, what great guts this fellow has, to think that he actually dared to hit the Eldest Young Master\u2019s face, he is simply just asking for trouble.\u201dHitting his face!When Xiao Jian heard this, his gloomy face turned even more terrifying. In regards to his status, he was the person with the highest talent in cultivation amongst the younger generation of the Xiao Clan. Before he was eighteen, he was already a peak Martial Disciple, a single step from becoming the youngest Martial Master in Mohe City. Xiao Chen was just a piece of trash, yet he actually dared to challenge him. Furthermore, he hit him in the face in front of everyone. What in the world was going on? Xiao Jian had already decided that if Xiao Chen dared to come, he would immediately cripple him, letting him truly taste regret.Time slowly went by, and the appointed time had already passed by four hours and Xiao Chen still had yet to make his appearance. The chatters of the crowd got louder and louder. Xiao Jian looked at the entrance, but there was no Xiao Chen in sight. He could not help but feel some frustration.Xiao Jian murmured to himself and proceeded towards the First Elder of the Xiao Clan, who presided over this duel, \u201cMartial uncle, Xiao Chen is still not here yet, should we send someone to find him?\u201dThe Xiao Clan\u2019s clan head, Xiao Xiong, had already entered a closed-door seclusion cultivation in order to break through and become a Martial Saint. He had left the management of the Xiao Clan\u2019s affairs to the First Elder, Xiao Qiang. For events such as this duel, Xiao Qiang would preside over them as well.Xiao Qiang coldly stated: \u201cYou think that I have not tried to find him in the past few days? The guards of Seven Horn Mountain told me that he went inside and has not left yet.\u201dWhen the surrounding people heard this, they found it incomparably strange. There were Rank 2 Spirit Beasts even on the outskirts of Seven Horn Mountain, so if a 9th Grade Spirit Refinement realm cultivator went inside, wouldn\u2019t they just be courting death?\u201cHaha, Young Master Xiao, that fellow might have already died at the paws of a Spirit Beast. It looks like you don\u2019t have to personally take action anymore.\u201d\u201cEven after seven days, he still hasn\u2019t come out. He is definitely dead. No wonder he had not shown up yet.\u201dSuddenly, a commotion broke out amongst the crowd alongside cries of surprise\u2014Xiao Chen had arrived!\u201cXiao Chen is here, he really is here.\u201d\u201cWho is the girl beside him? Do you guys know?\u201d\u201c\u2018I\u2019ve never seen her. It is almost time for the duel, why did he bring a girl along? However, this girl is quite pretty.\u201dXiao Chen just ignored their blabber and calmly walked towards the arena in the middle of the martial hall. Xiao Yulan followed by his side with a frown. She was not used to so many people paying attention to her.At first, Xiao Jian was shocked when he heard the news of Xiao Chen\u2019s arrival. After Xiao Chen arrived at the stage, however, Xiao Jian simply laughed coldly, \u201cBrother Chen, I thought that the Spirit Beasts had already eaten you at Seven Horn Mountain. I never expected that you would be able to make your way out.\u201dXiao Chen smiled gently: \u201cMany thanks to elder brother for your concerns, but before we settle this, how could I allow myself to die?\u201dAt this moment, Xiao Qiang, who had been observing the course of events, suddenly widened his eyes. He looked at Xiao Yulan with a complex expression and walked over quickly and said, \u201cLan`er, you are finally willing to coming down from the mountain, why didn\u2019t you tell me first?\u201dXiao Yulan said a little unnaturally: \u201cI came down with Cousin on the spur of the moment. I merely came to watch the duel today.\u201dXiao Qiang seemed like he had something he wanted to say, but he did not speak up in the end. In regards to Xiao Yulan, a deep sense of guilt had always been lodged in his heart. When she was small, he sent her to Seven Horn Mountain because she could not control her own Martial Spirit. However, he watched her grew lonelier and lonelier as she grew older. Xiao Qiang felt disgusted at himself, was he too cruel?When Xiao Yulan was able to control her own Martial Spirit, Xiao Qiang tried to persuade her to leave the mountains a few times. However, Xiao Yulan had been isolated from people for too long. No matter how he urged her, she still would not leave the mountain.\u201cUncle Qiang, can we start now?\u201d Xiao Jian said impatiently as he stood at the side.Xiao\u00a0Qiang recovered from his shock and said to Xiao Chen: \u201cAre you ready?\u201dSeeing Xiao Chen nod his head, Xiao Qiang said in a deep voice: \u201cAlthough this duel is a fight to the death, you are brothers, after all. I would like to emphasize that if one party admits his loss, the other party must stop. It is best that all grievances end with this. Xiao Jian, can you do this?\u201dXiao Jian nodded his head but smiled coldly in his heart. Killing Xiao Chen would dirty his hands, he would stop before that happened. What a joke! However, he had to think of a way to thoroughly cripple the cultivation of this reckless fellow.The two of them got onto the arena, stood at their respective corners, and paid their respects to each other. This duel had officially started and the atmosphere in the martial hall also started to turn heavy.Xiao Jian stood on the arena, slowly raising his killing intent. He did not intend to drag out this fight and was prepared to finish Xiao Chen with one move. A trash at the 9th Grade of Spirit Refinement, if he could not finish him with one move, then he would lose all of his face.Xiao Chen stood casually in the corner, staying on his guard, and circulated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation in his body. After the battle with the First Elder of the Zhang Clan, Xiao Chen did not feel any feel fear towards the Xiao Jian who was a peak Martial Disciple. He was not worried about this battle, and there was no way that Xiao Jian\u2019s Medial Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique could stand up against his Superior Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique, even if he had only six days of practice under his belt.Xiao Jian did not hold back and raised his peak Martial Disciple strength to its max. He was simply waiting for Xiao Chen to let his guard down before making a move, radiating out his killing intent to pressure Xiao Chen.After cultivating the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation, Xiao Chen was very sensitive to the flow of Qi. However, to Xiao Chen, Xiao Jian\u2019s killing intent seemed incredibly weak, not affecting him at all. He just gave Xiao Jian a mild smile and looked at him fearlessly.When the Azure Dragon that swam in Xiao Chen\u2019s Dantian felt this minuscule killing intent, it felt as if it\u2019s dignity was sullied. It let loose a loud roar within Xiao Chen\u2019s body, causing Xiao Chen\u2019s aura to suddenly rise explosively.\u201cBoom!\u201dIn an instant,\u00a0Xiao Jian\u2019s killing intent was forcefully bounced back. The might of this ancient Azure Dragon Holy Beast Martial Spirit was not something an insignificant Martial Disciple could withstand. Xiao Jian felt incomparably shocked. Xiao Chen actually managed to send his aura back, so could it be that he had already achieved the Martial Master realm?That was impossible! Xiao Jian\u2019s complexion changed slightly. Xiao Chen was a 9th Grade Spirit Refinement trash, how could he suddenly break through from peak Martial Disciple to Martial Master realm? He had to make his move soon, Xiao Jian knew that his mental state was already shook. He had to make his move and could wait no longer.\u201cReceive my Martial Technique, Inferno Chop!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A fireball burned on his fist, releasing a strong heatwave into the surroundings. His killing intent caused\u00a0Xiao Chen to freeze up. Xiao Jian smiled coldly, with his speed as a peak Martial Disciple, it would be impossible for Xiao Chen to escape. This Inferno Chop was a Medial Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Techniques that he had cultivated for several years, so he was certain he would definitely finish this with one hit!Xiao Chen\u2019s expression turned grave. Seeing Xiao Jian\u2019s speed, he knew that he definitely could not avoid it. Since he could not avoid it, then he would receive it head on!With the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation frantically circulating inside him, Xiao Chen stomped ruthlessly on the ground and flew upwards. His Purple Thunder True Fire poured out of his right hand with a roar, encasing his entire right fist. This was the results of Xiao Chen cultivating for six days.He did not believe that the True Fire of an Immortal Cultivator would be unable compete against this ordinary fire!\u201cBang!\u201dTheir fists met in mid-air, and Xiao Chen was forced back a few steps before he managed to stabilize himself. The blood and qi in his body were in turmoil, but he quickly circulated his Essence to calm the fluctuations in his blood and qi. It seemed that his raw strength was still slightly inferior to Xiao Jian\u2019s strength, as he had a peak Martial Disciple cultivation.Xiao Jian only had to take a few light steps back to stabilize himself, incessantly sneering at Xiao Chen in his heart. Earlier, when purple flames suddenly appeared on Xiao Chen\u2019s right fist, it had scared him quite a bit. However, after that exchange, he realized that looks could be deceiving, as the strength of that flame was only at the Martial Disciple realm. It seemed that this fellow finally condensed his Martial Spirit, and this strange flame could possibly be his Martial Spirit.However, when Xiao Jian thought about it, he realized he could make good use of this opportunity today to thoroughly destroy Xiao Chen\u2019s Martial Spirit. He could make Xiao Chen never be able to recover again.However, something strange had happened. That purple flame which had entwined with Xiao Jian\u2019s Inferno Chop had not actually extinguished. Xiao Jian pretended it was nothing and just flung his hand around trying to put out the flames.However, these purple flames were like they had been doused with oil. They continued to burn stronger, continually consuming the Essence on Xiao Jian\u2019s palm. He was very shocked and hurriedly circulated Essence to his right palm. Unexpectedly, the purple flames were incomparably stubborn. Even after it was wrapped with a huge amount of Essence, it still continued to unsparingly consume the Essence that Xiao Jian sent to it.What was going on!Xiao Jian immediately felt frantic in his heart. He began to randomly swing his hands around. However, regardless of how he swung his hands, this flame was like a leech sticking to his body, unwilling to be flung off. The Essence in his body still continued to stream towards his palm. After a period of time, the purple flame seemed to have finally consumed all of its energy and began to slowly extinguish itself.Xiao Jian finally managed to catch his breath with difficulty when suddenly, there was a crackling sound in the air. When he raised his head, there was a bright and blinding thunderbolt firing towards him.Superior Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique \u2014 Divine Thunder Break!\u201cBang!\u201dXiao Jian shrieked out miserably and his whole body flew off the arena. He was charred black and continuously convulsed, arcs of electricity jumping around his body.Silence!The surroundings became incomparably silent. The martial hall, which was bustling with noise and excitement earlier, was now absolutely silent. Everyone\u2019s mouths were agape in shock.While they stood there watching all these events unfold, they felt incomparably stupefied.\u00a0There were even some who stood very far at the back, who did not know what had happened, all thinking how did Xiao Jian suddenly fly off the arena?The two of them had only exchanged a blow and the duel had just started. In the eyes of the audience, this duel would definitely not take too long. The martial realms of these two were just too far apart. Xiao Chen should be completely helpless and be rendered useless in a single blow.\u00a0But now, the situation had inverted from their expectations.The audience could not believe it when they saw that the strongest person in the younger generation, Xiao Jian, was actually defeated in one move by the trash still in 9th Grade Spirit Refinement. This completely exceeded their expectations.Xiao Chen looked at the distant Xiao Yulan and gently smiled at her. He proceeded to leap off the arena and headed towards the gates without even looking at Xiao Jian on the floor. He had stayed his hands earlier and had split his attention to the Purple Thunder True Fire. If he struck out with the Divine Thunder Break at its maximum strength, he could have shattered Xiao Jian\u2019s Martial Spirit.The crowd automatically parted a path and looked at Xiao Chen with a complicated expression. Those Xiao Clan disciples who used to be on good terms with Xiao Jian did not even dare to look Xiao Chen in the eye.Xiao Clan courtyard.The duel was already half a month ago, and in this half a month, Xiao Chen could feel the attitudes of the Xiao Clan members towards him had been changing. Reverence and respect replaced the looks of disdain from the past. This was how the Tianwu Continent was like, it was a world where the strong ruled, and only with strength could one obtain the respect of others.Xiao Chen ignored these changed attitudes. Aside from accompanying Xiao Yulan into Mohe City for a few times in the past half a month, he had spent the rest of his time cultivating. The events in Seven Horn Mountain had left a shadow in his heart, there was probably some conspiracy between that mysterious man in blue and the Zhang Clan, and it was probably related to the Promise of Ten Years that would happen a few months later.Although he was not a person of this world, if the Xiao Clan lost Seven Horn Mountain, they would definitely lose their standing in Mohe City. With his current strength, if he lost the protection of the Xiao Clan, not to mention a Martial Saint, even a Martial Grand Master could easily kill him. Xiao Chen felt a deep sense of crisis. He could only continue to become stronger, which was how he could hold his fate in his own hands in the future.The cultivation of the Purple Thunder True Fire had already reached the 2nd layer and it no longer required the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation to be circulated. With just his will, he could condense the flames. With his great control, the Purple Thunder True Fire could now leave his hands and float in the air. Now that he achieved this realm, he had achieved the basic requirements of refining medicinal pills. Thus, Xiao Chen decided to go to Mohe City to buy a suitable medicine cauldron to try and refine medicinal pills.Mohe city was one of the eight main cities of the Qizi\u00a0county; within the Great Qin Nation, it could only be considered an ordinary, small city. Aside from the original owner of this body, Xiao Chen himself had come here more than once already, so he was familiar with the roads and arrived shortly.Xiao Chen confidently walked to the largest smithy, called Regretful Iron. Its main branch was located at the Continent\u2019s Capital, and the Dong Clan backing it was said to be the Great Qin Nation\u2019s top merchant association.The interior decorations were quite unique and its shelves were filled with weapons and armor of all colors. There were many customers in there, indicating that the business of this smithy was quite good. Xiao Chen approached the shelf reserved specially for medicine cauldrons. After checking it out for a long period of time, he was interested in none of them, as these were only made out of ordinary metals.Xiao Chen shook his head and was about to leave when suddenly a bold heroic voice called out from behind him, \u201cYoung Master Xiao, are you here to buy medicine cauldrons?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This old man still seemed to be very alert and energetic. Xiao Chen tried, but he could not recall the name of this person, thus he could not help but ask out of suspicions, \u201cYou are?\u201dThat old man laughed, \u201cHaha, perhaps Young Master Xiao does not recognize this old man. I am the owner of this shop, my humble surname is Ma.\u201dXiao Chen smiled gently, \u201cSo it is Boss Ma. I am indeed thinking of purchasing a quality medicine cauldron, but the goods in your shop just seem to be average.\u201dBoss Ma laughed loudly, \u201c Since Young Master Xiao does not fancy any of these cauldrons, how about you follow me to the back to take a look?\u201dGo to the back and take a look? Xiao Chen immediately turned vigilant. In his memories, he did not recall having any contact with this Boss Ma. Why would Boss Ma suddenly invite him inside for no reason? What intentions did he have? Although he needed a good medicine cauldron, he could not help but feel suspicious.\u201cIn that case, Boss Ma please lead the way.\u201d Xiao Chen smiled gently. His desire for a good medicine cauldron outweighed the suspicions that he had. However, he still remained on guard and at the first sign of any trouble, he would immediately leave.Boss Ma led Xiao Chen past the crowds and headed\u00a0upstairs. After arriving upstairs, he could see that the goods displayed on the second floor were of a much higher quality than downstairs. Xiao Chen even spotted some Spirit Weapons. The prices here were high, thus there were many who were just browsing and only a few that were buying. Boss Ma just gently smiled and continued to lead the way. They continued until they reached the fourth floor.From the second floor onwards, there were fewer and fewer people. When they arrived on the fourth floor, there were virtually no people. The decorations on the fourth floor were extremely luxurious. Despite this, the fact that there were no display shelves made Xiao Chen feel suspicious. Only a youth dressed in embroidered clothes stood at the window with\u00a0his\u00a0back facing away from the window, looking down at the streets below.When that youth heard their footsteps, he turned and smiled: \u201cIt\u2019s been tough Boss Ma, have a rest first, I will entertain this guest.\u201d His voice was melodious, natural, graceful, and delicate, like the sound of a wind chime.Boss Ma gently nodded his head and bowed before he withdrew. That youth quickly walked over and said to Xiao Chen, \u201cIt was presumptuous of me to do this, forgive me if I have offended you.\u201dAfter Xiao Chen saw the appearance of this person more clearly, he smiled gently in his heart. This youth wearing embroidered clothes was actually a girl cross-dressing. Her facial features were picturesque, and she had white teeth and twinkling eyes, though the male clothing she wore gave her a heroic air.Xiao Chen smiled, \u201cSince when did Mohe City have a beauty like you? I actually did not realize that.\u201dThe girl smiled. She did not mind Xiao Chen\u2019s teasing, \u201cYoung Master Xiao must be joking, I have heard of your distinguished reputation and upon seeing you for myself, I must say that it seems true.\u201dXiao Chen\u2019s suspicions deepened in his heart. She knew of his reputation, but she was still so courteous to him? What was the origin of this girl? Without changing his expression, he kept smiling gently and said: \u201cI still have not asked you for your name yet.\u201d\u201cFeng Feixue.\u201dFeng Feixue, Xiao Chen muttered that name mentally a few times. He was sure that this girl was not from Mohe City. Thinking of this possibility, he still did not change his expression, \u201cSo it is Miss Feng. Well, I shall cut to the chase, show me the medicine cauldron.\u201dFeng Feixue\u2019s red lips parted and laughed lightly, looking extremely alluring, \u201cYoung Master Xiao is really impatient, and here I was prepared to chat with you for quite awhile.\u201dWhen she finished saying that, she waved her hands and four strangely shaped medicine cauldrons appeared out of nowhere on the wooden table nearby. Xiao Chen was shocked, because she was actually using a Spatial Ring. Looks like this girl had a great background, as even a regular Martial Saint might not get the chance to use a Spatial Ring.Soon, his surprise turned into amazement and his gaze was quickly attracted to the four medicine cauldrons on the wooden table. These four medicine cauldrons all had different shapes and were obviously saturated with Spiritual Energy. Xiao Chen was sure that these medicine cauldrons were alloyed with Moonstone, and they were not just alloyed with a little bit of Moonstone powder, or else its color and Spiritual Energy would not be so thick.Amongst them, there was an Azure Dragon medicine cauldron that attracted his attention. This cauldron stood on three legs and there were two vivid and lifelike Azure Dragons entrenched together on its body. One of the dragon heads was for inputting the fire and the other was for outputting the pills. The handicraft of the person who made this cauldron was very good and the carving of the Azure Dragon was extremely expressive. It looked like it was about to come to life.Xiao Chen held it in his hands and played around with it for a little, eventually asking: \u201cCan I give this medicine cauldron a test run?\u201dFeng Feixue was a little shocked in her heart, could he be an alchemist? Was this medicine cauldron for his own use? It looked like her earlier assumption might be wrong. Without changing her expression, \u201cNo problem, please go ahead.\u201dXiao Chen placed the medicine cauldron on the table and used his\u00a0consciousness\u00a0to condense a ball of purple flames with his right hand. He slowly pushed the flame down the cauldron and carefully controlled the purple flames to enter the medicine cauldron. When it completely entered the cauldron, he released his control and let the purple flames burn ferociously.Xiao Chen carefully observed \u00a0the medicine cauldron. Under the heat of the purple flames, the azure colored medicine cauldron did not experience any changes. Its Spiritual Energy was still incomparable like before. After letting the purple flames burn for awhile, Xiao Chen could feel his Essence diminishing. He hurriedly retrieved the purple flames and calmed the fluctuations of Spiritual Energy in his body.Xiao Chen picked up the Azure Dragon Cauldron and took a closer look, the outside of the medicine cauldron was not hot. After he opened the cauldron lid, a stream of hot air came out. Xiao Chen seemed to have seen a formless Azure Dragon rising up into the air. He sniffed the inside of the cauldron light, the air in there was dry and pleasant, there were no strange odors.Xiao Chen felt incomparably amazed in his heart, this was exactly what he needed. If he only needed an ordinary medicine cauldron, then there were plenty in the Xiao Clan. It was a pity that under the refinement of the Purple Thunder True Fire, those ordinary medicine cauldron would start to have cracks after a short while. Those cauldrons were just not suitable for refining medicines.He had not held much hope when he came to this shop, thus he had only brought a piece of Moonstone with him. If he could not find a suitable one, he would use this piece of Moonstone to refine one. He did not expect to be able to find a cauldron to his liking in Regretful Iron.Xiao Chen smiled: \u201cMiss Feng, I wonder how much you want for this medicine cauldron?\u201dFeng Feixue picked up the Azure Dragon Medicine Cauldron and played with it in her hands, she did not give Xiao Chen a direct answer, \u201c Alchemists are one of the most respected professions in the Tianwu Continent. Undeniably,\u00a0a top quality medicine cauldron is not the most important thing to an alchemist. Medicine cauldrons can be classified into five grades, does Young Master Xiao knows about this?There were definitely differences in the quality of medicine cauldron, but Xiao Chen had not heard about the classification of five grades before. He shook his head and said, \u201cPlease elaborate.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The medicinal pills refined through one as a result will not exceed\u00a0grade two, and that\u2019s excluding peak quality pills; a grade-two medicine cauldron has some small amounts of Moonstones mixed in, just like Yellow Ranked Spirit Weapons, and can withstand the Spiritual Flames of the world. It is insignificant and does not have any soul, so it is difficult for medicinal pills refined from such a cauldron to be of peak quality; and a grade-three medicinal cauldron can barely be considered a medicine cauldron of superior quality, notwithstanding it being alloyed with a large amount of Moonstone, as well as other rare materials. In addition, it is made by a skilled blacksmith.\u00a0This kind of medicine cauldron can have a soul and the medicinal pills refined by it can achieve their peak effects.\u00a0Its whole body is perfectly smooth and round, making any leakage of medicinal fragrance virtually impossible.\u201d Feng Feixue spoke as though it was routine as she actively replied.Xiao Chen listened with interest, \u201cWhat about grade-four and grade-five?\u201dFeng Feixue stopped for a while before continuing, \u201cOnce a medicine cauldron crosses over the boundary of the third grade, it will become what is better known as a heavenly cauldron. Heavenly cauldrons are very rare, and not only do they require large amounts of Moonstones and a pile of materials, they also require a divine-level blacksmith to imbue it with a soul during casting. Due to the scarcity of Moonstones, there have not been any new heavenly cauldrons for hundreds of years. As for the divine cauldron that is above the heavenly cauldron, I had only read about it in books and have not seen it before.\u201dXiao Chen pondered on everything Feng Feixue had said: \u201cThen what grade is this Azure Dragon medicine cauldron?\u201d\u201cThis is a work at the peak of grade-three. If you can find a divine blacksmith to infuse it with a soul, then it can immediately become a heavenly cauldron.\u201d Feng Feixue said unhurriedly, looking at Xiao Chen without blinking.This Azure Dragon medicine cauldron was actually a top grade-three medicine cauldron... it seems that he had underestimated the price of this medicine cauldron earlier. He would not be able to afford the price of this Azure Dragon medicine cauldron even if he scrounged together all the silver taels to his name.However, Xiao Chen was unresigned and pushed for the envelope, \u201cI wonder what it would take for Miss Feng to be willing to part with this Azure Dragon medicine cauldron?\u201dFeng Feixue took the Azure Dragon medicine cauldron and tossed it around, a trace of wit flitting across her face as she smiled, \u201cIf Young Master Xiao is truly interested, then how about I give it to you as a gift?\u201dAs a gift? Xiao Chen was surprised, but he quickly reacted mentally, how could there be such a good thing in this world? Xiao Chen smiled embarrassedly: \u201cMiss Feng, please stop teasing me, just state your price. I may not have much money on hand, but I believe that I should still be able to afford this medicine cauldron.\u201dFeng Feixue smiled: \u201cAre you really able to afford it? A superior grade-one medicine cauldron would require a few thousand taels of silver; a superior grade-two medicine cauldron requires tens of thousands of silver taels; and as for this top grade-three medicine cauldron, it would be impossible to purchase this without hundreds of thousands of silver taels.\u201dSo expensive!Xiao Chen frowned. Hundreds of thousands of silver taels was nothing to the Xiao Clan, but it was not a small sum either. Would the Xiao Clan spend such an amount on him? It was hard to say.Actually, if she truly wanted to sell this top grade-three medicine cauldron, she could even sell it for a million silver taels at an auction. Moonstones were far too rare in the continent, and heavenly cauldrons were already rarely seen in the past century. This top grade-three medicine cauldron could be possibly the best medicine cauldron most alchemists would be able to use in their entire life.People with the alchemist occupation were also a seldom sight lately. It could be said that every alchemist was the result of a clan\u2019s heavy investment. They had no mind to be frugal with their money, considering it perfectly normal to spend a fortune in order to purchase a quality cauldron.Even though it was such, when Xiao Chen heard Feng Feixue\u2019s words, he felt uncomfortable. Xiao Chen smiled coldly: \u201cMiss Feng, it seems you've already decided for yourself that I, Xiao Chen, of all people, cannot afford such a luxurious item, isn\u2019t it?\u201dFeng Feixue\u2019s smile froze. Realizing that the tone of her words was inappropriate, she hurriedly added: \u201cYoung Master Xiao, you misunderstand me. You can have this medicine cauldron right away! If Young Master Xiao does not have enough silver, you can just write a promissory note.\u201dXiao Chen took out a piece of Moonstone the size of his palm, \u201cMany thanks for Miss Feng\u2019s intentions, but there is no need for a promissory note. I wonder if this piece of Moonstone is worth the price.\u201dFeng Feixue was taken by surprise. She picked up the palm-sized Moonstone and inspected it carefully before smiling bitterly, \u201cYoung Master Xiao, I truly have good intentions, are you not willing to accept this kindness of mine?\u201dXiao Chen held the Azure Dragon medicine cauldron in his hands and promptly cupped them in a polite gesture signifying he was taking his leave, \u201cMany thanks for Miss Feng\u2019s medicine cauldron, goodbye!\u201d After he said that, he turned to walk away without looking back. Xiao Chen felt uneasy staying in that room. The emergence of this medicine cauldron was a little strange, so it was best that he left early.Feng Feixue stared pensively at the palm-sized Moonstone in her hand. Such a large piece of Moonstone would allow one to forge an Inferior Grade Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon and still have materials in reserve. This naturally covered the cost of her medicine cauldron by a long shot. Looking at Xiao Chen\u2019s disappearing figure, Feng Feixue smiled gently, \u201cXiao Chen, looks like the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit is not your only secret.\u201dUnbeknownst as to when, but a man shrouded in darkness appeared behind Feng Feixue all of a sudden. The appearance of this man was quite abrupt, as though he had been there all along.\u201cBig Miss, actually, more than a thousand years has passed since that promise was made. There is no need to honor it anymore.\u201d e hoarse voice came from that man in the shadows.Feng Feixue\u2019s expression turned cold as she warned him, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to bother about my matters.\u201d\u201cI am just reminding Big Miss, the clan takes priority.\u201d That hoarse voice spoke once again, as though he did not hear Feng Feixue\u2019s warning.Feng Feixue smiled coldly, \u201cShu, I will say it once again, don\u2019t interfere in my matters. If I find out that anything has happened to Xiao Chen, regardless of whosoever\u2019s fault it is, I will blame it on you.\u201dWithin the shadows, Shu laughed out coldly and changed the topic, \u201cWe have found out the facial appearance of the person you are looking for. We should have his exact address in another seven days.\u201dFeng Feixue stared blankly for awhile, \u201cI understand what you mean, I have not forgotten the purpose in coming here. Pay special attention to this, I don\u2019t want anything going wrong.\u201dAfter Xiao Chen left the doors of Regretful Iron, he took a deep breath of the fresh air in the large street. The feeling of a pair of eyes staring at him was present the entire time he was on the fourth floor, which made him feel exceedingly uncomfortable as if danger was looming, rendering his senses uneasy.Regardless of the result, he had accomplished his motive for coming out today. He held the Azure Dragon medicine cauldron in his bag as he smiled in satisfaction and made preparations to head on over to the herbs shop and buy some herbs before heading home.Mohe City was quite bustling in the day; there was high human traffic and the shouts of people advertising their products, and it was far from being cold and cheerless. Xiao Chen was not in a hurry, slowly walking on the big street and appreciating the strange scenery he would never have had the chance to see back home on Earth.Right at this very moment, however, the sound of galloping horses emerged in the distance. Xiao Chen relied on his great eyesight to gain a clear view of the commotion ahead. There were three people riding their fine steeds on the street in a brisk gallop, and everyone on the street parted a path for them. There were some who did not manage to get out of the way in time and could do nothing but dive to the ground in their moment of haste, dirt inadvertently entering their mouths. When they saw the people on the horses, they did not dare to say anything and could just consider themselves unlucky. When the people on the horses saw this, they laughed loudly, looking incredibly arrogant. They spurred the horses on, not reducing their speed.In the blink of an eye, those three horse almost arrived at the front of Xiao Chen. A little girl in front, standing in the middle of the street, was so frightened when she saw the galloping horses that she ended up crying. The horses galloped faster and faster, and despite their clear collision course with the little girl, the riders did not slow down at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This group of people was too outrageous. He dashed forward, grabbed the little girl in the very instant of her imminent peril, and evaded the group of marching horses\u2026\u201cNeigh!\u201dThe one leading the three men pulled on the reins, causing the horse to neigh as he reared it to a stop. When the two people behind saw this, they also followed suit in a hurry. The person in the lead was dressed in a brown flowery gown and was the first to turn his horse around and slowly trot over to Xiao Chen.\u201cI had wondered who this familiar-looking person was, so it was actually the Second Young Master of the Xiao Clan. Why are you imitating others and acting chivalrous today?\u201d The youth riding\u00a0on the back\u00a0of the horse towered over him and laughed loudly with arrogance.\u201cIndeed, Young Master Xiao has been a rare sight in Misty Rain Pavilion, Young Master Xiao\u2019s character has indeed changed.\u201d One of the other men riding a horse quickly followed-up.Xiao Chen gently placed down the little girl and looked coldly at the group of people on horseback. These three people were Zhang Clan disciples, and the one leading them was Zhang Zeyang, the second son of the Zhang Clan clan head. He had an equally horrible reputation in Mohe City as Xiao Chen, but it was not because he was trash as well. Instead, it was for bullying the commoners as well as his arrogant and despotic character. Due to the fact that the Zhang Clan and the Xiao Clan were at loggerheads, whenever the two of them met, there would definitely be some disagreements. However, Xiao Chen had always been on the losing end.\u201cWhat are you looking at? What kind of expression is that? Are you seeking death?\u201d One of the men behind Zhang Zeyang raised his horsewhip and suddenly lashed in Xiao Chen\u2019s direction. The whip cracked in the air, fast approaching Xiao Chen\u2019s face\u00a0with\u00a0whiplash. If it were the Xiao Chen of old, it would have definitely hit him and caused a laceration.Xiao Chen smiled coldly as he used his hand to grab the whip firmly with a fluid swipe of his arm, greatly astonishing the person on horseback. He wished to retract the whip, but he was not able to even move it an inch, as though it had been wedged tightly in a steel vice grip. There seemed to be a flash of lightning in Xiao Chen\u2019s eyes as arcs of electricity leapt around on his hands, issuing crackling sounds.With a whooshing sound, the electricity traveled along the horsewhip to the hands of that person. Very soon, it jumped around that person\u2019s body in wide arcs, sparing not even the horse he was mounted on from electrocution. The horse was shocked, resulted in it jumping about wildly, and the Zhang Clan disciple himself was flung from the horse and landed with a loud thud.Zhang Zeyang quickly leaped off his horse and helped the person on the ground up. That person\u2019s face was pale and was still trembling. With the electricity having invaded the meridians of his body, he would not be recovering anytime soon.\u201cXiao Chen! You dare hurt my cousin! Are you tired of living?\u201d Zhang Zeyang shouted out in a powerful voice.Xiao Chen smiled indifferently, \u201cZhang Zeyang, according to your logic, I cannot retaliate and can only allow you to hit me? Was this reasoning taught to you by your mother or your father? Being just the insignificant second son of the Zhang Clan, do you really think that there is no one in Mohe City that can deal with you?\u201dZhang Zeyang was stunned\u2014this Xiao Chen\u2019s character had really changed! In the past, when they met, it would be routine for him to beat him up. Due to the fact that this was a shameful matter, he wouldn\u2019t possibly dare tell his clan, so he, Zhang Zeyang, was not worried at all. Why was Xiao Chen behaving so assertively today? However, no matter how assertive he was, he was still trash. Zhang Zeyang would be able to deal with garbage of the 9th Grade Spirit Refinement realm as a Medial Grade Martial Disciple quite easily.Thinking of this point, Zhang Zeyang did not bother about Xiao Chen\u2019s taunt and smiled coldly, \u201cYoung Master Xiao, are you in that much of a hurry to die?\u201dXiao Chen laughed loudly, \u201cAre you an idiot? After speaking so much, you are still only able to say the same thing over and over again. What does my death have to do with you? If you have the abilities then come and hit me. I will stand still over here, come if you dare.\u201d\u201cYou really think that I would not dare to hit you?\u201d Upon hearing such mockery, Zhang Zeyang could no longer hold back. He shouted angrily as the Essence in his body circulated rapidly inside him. He then hurled a fist towards Xiao Chen with a roar, using about eighty percent of his full power. Xiao Chen had crossed his bottom line by mocking him in public, which was intolerable in his books!Xiao Chen smiled coldly, so that was all it took to infuriate him? He followed the incoming fist, replete with killing intent and more, with his gaze, the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation circulating rapidly in his body.\u00a0The Azure Dragon in his Dantian roared lightly as his Essence surged, raring to come out.\u201cHu!\u201dXiao Chen struck out, unleashing a plain fist just like Zhang Zeyang\u2019s. Xiao Chen had used his full power in this fist, and a thunderous sound of wind billowed off his fist as purple crackling electrical arcs gathered on it.\u201cBANG!\u201dTheir two fists collided head-on, setting off an explosive sound that filled the skies. Zhang Zeyang could only feel a turbulent force heading in his direction, and it was by far not something he could withstand easily. His body was blasted back a few steps before he was able to stabilize himself. His face had turned incredibly pale and blood trickled out from the corner of his mouth.Xiao Chen cultivated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation in addition to the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit, so the Essence in his body was very deep and profound. The full force of his cultivation as a Martial Disciple was equivalent to a peak Martial Disciple. Zhang Zeyang had thought that Xiao Chen was still in the 9th Grade Spirit Refinement realm, and thus only used eighty percent of his full power. When going against Xiao Chen, who was using his full force, how could he have overcome that?\u201cWith just that insignificant amount of strength, you dare to throw your weight around in Mohe City?\u201d Xiao Chen snorted. He ferociously stomped on the ground with his right foot, imprinting his foot in small cracks on the marble floor of the street. This stomp caused Xiao Chen to fly forward, reaching Zhang Zeyang\u2019s front instantaneously. He struck his palm out towards Zhang Zeyang\u2019s chest.This happened incredibly fast, and even the people beside Zhang Zeyang were unable to react to it. Looking at this palm imbued with murderous intent, he felt jittery and shut his eyes in despair. Could it be that I, Zhang Zeyang, will die here today?\u201cStop!\u201d An explosive shout came from afar. The voice was very loud and shook the eardrums of everyone present. Xiao Chen ignored this voice and continued to send out his powerful palm strike towards Zhang Zeyang. The opportunity to cripple\u00a0Zhang Zeyang was not something that came by everyday, after all.\u00a0All or nothing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It nimbly went behind Zhang Zeyang and ferociously pulled him backward, saving him.The figure then struck out quickly, clashing with Xiao Chen\u2019s palm. Only two breaths of time had passed since this person had shouted. His speed and strength were evident.A surging strength emanated from that person\u2019s palm, forcing Xiao Chen to quickly retreated three steps before he managed to stabilize himself. The blood in his body was in turmoil, Xiao Chen hurriedly circulated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation to protect his Dantian and calm the fluctuating blood and Essence in his body.In front of Xiao Chen was the person who had struck out. The man was dressed in white, he was very handsome and had a faint smile on his indifferent face. His eyes held had a trace of pride, making his expression seem colder.\u201cBig brother, why are you here?\u201d Zhang Zeyang, who was saved, shouted out in joy. After realizing who had rescued him, he knew that he could possibly turn this situation around to his advantage.That person in white smiled gently, \u201cI waited for a while but you guys hadn\u2019t arrived yet, so I came to look for you. What timing, I got to see a good show.\u201dThis person in white was Zhang He, he was the eldest son of the Zhang Clan and his innate talent was very good. When he was ten years old, he was accepted into the continent\u2019s capital\u2019s White Cliff School. He had rarely come back in the past few years. Based on his earlier palm strike, one could tell that his cultivation had already reached the Martial Master realm for many years already. Looks like there was no longer any opportunity to cripple Zhang Zeyang\u2019s cultivation.\u00a0Since there were no longer any opportunities then there was no need for him to dillydally here,\u00a0thought Xiao Chen. Thus, he turned away and started to leave.Suddenly, there was the sound of a sonic boom. Xiao Chen did not even bother to look, he just turned his body and launched a Divine Thunder Break backwards. A bright lightning bolt streaked through the air, heading to the area\u00a0in between Zhang He\u2019s eyebrows.Zhang He pulled back and stood still, his entire body like a treasured sword. A majestic sword intent suddenly fired out from his body leaving countless sword Qi in the air. After a short period of time, that bright lightning bolt dissipated.\u201cThis distinguished friend, you bullied my second brother earlier and even seemed to have enjoyed doing so. How can you just leave like that? Why don\u2019t you stay and give us some pointers?\u201d Zhang He stood straight with his hands behind his back, looking very casual.Although Xiao Chen did not turn his head back to look, he knew very clearly what had happened behind him. His Divine Thunder Break was dissipated by Zhang He. This person was indeed very strong but he was just\u00a0so-so, Xiao Chen was not afraid of him. A mere Martial Master, even if he could not defeat him, it would be easy for him to escape!He turned around and smiled in a relaxed manner, \u201cI have heard that the eldest son of the Zhang Clan\u2019s Martial Spirit is the Holy Sword \u2014 Clear Sky Sword. It has a heaven and ground shaking might and its sword intent can communicate with\u00a0spirits. After seeing it, I must say that it lives up to its reputation. I, as an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple, concedes his defeat.Zhang He could tell that Xiao Chen\u2019s words were subtly mocking him for bullying the weak with his strength. He did not mind it at all and continued to smile, \u201cBrother Xiao is too humble, I heard that the number one person in your Xiao Clan, Xiao Jian, was defeated by you in one move. That Xiao Jian was a proper peak Martial Disciple, he was even more unyielding than myself.\u201dXiao Chen was surprised, this person had been all the way in the continent\u2019s capital and yet he was so familiar with the news of the Xiao Clan? This person could not be underestimated. Without changing his expression, Xiao Chen calmly replied: \u201cIt is just a rumor, does Young Master Zhang believe them too?\u201dThe two of them glared at each other, observing each other closely. Zhang He\u2019s gaze was as sharp as a sword, the Clear Sky Sword letting out a drone. Additionally, a terrifying sword intent was emitted from his body. The sword intent became more and more intense before shooting out from his eyes, his formless sword intent seemed solid as it shot towards Xiao Chen ferociously with a sonic boom.The aura of a Martial Master combined with this flood of sword intent firmly locked Xiao Chen in place. Xiao Chen frowned tightly, the Azure Dragon in his body casually swam around in his body. The might of the ancient Holy Beast combined with Xiao Chen\u2019s aura began to clash with this formless sword intent.Under the might of this ancient Holy Beast, the powerful sword intent was stopped in its tracks about two meters away from Xiao Chen. It was unable to progress forward. At this moment, the two of them were in a deadlock, Zhang He\u2019s Medial Martial Master aura was not able to overpower Xiao Chen\u2019s seemingly insignificant cultivation of Inferior Martial Disciple.\u201cBig Brother, why are you talking so much nonsense with him? He tried to kill me earlier.\u201d Zhang Zeyang stood at the side with a sullen face.When he heard these words, Zhang He despised his own younger brother in his heart. It may have seemed like he had effortlessly dissipated Xiao Chen\u2019s Divine Thunder Break earlier, but he had actually spent a lot of effort to do so and had used a lot of Essence. Now, he was delaying Xiao Chen as he slowly recovered his Essence. He was waiting for Xiao Chen to show an opening so that he could make a move. If the person in front of him was so easy to deal with, he would have made a move long ago.The aura that he had been gathering was\u00a0interrupted\u00a0by Zhang Zeyang\u2019s words, Zhang He had no choice but to retrieve his sword intent and make the first move.Xiao Chen did not have any fear in his heart. Instead, he was full of a vigorous battle intent. He had wanted to test his strength out a long time ago but he could not find a suitable opponent. Xiao Yulan could have been a good opponent but the poison of the Poinsettia was too strong. If he battled with her, his life would be in danger if he was careless for even a moment. The strength of the other Xiao Clan disciples were too weak and it was too problematic to seek the help of those elders.The Zhang He in front of him was the best opponent. He was in the Martial Master realm and had a Holy Sword Martial Spirit. Xiao Chen wanted to see what kind of results he could obtain in this battle if he used his full power.While Xiao Chen was thinking,\u00a0Zhang He had already taken the advantage and dashed over to attack first.\u00a0The wind from his palm was like swords as it slashed towards Xiao Chen\u2019s chest. Xiao Chen took a small step back and circulated his Purple Thunder Divine Incantation to its peak. There were arcs of electricity leaping around his body before they finally headed to his right palm. At that moment, their palms clashed together.\u201cBang!\u201dA surging energy poured out and a stream of Qi rippled all around. The two of them did not stop and continued to strike out at each other. There were sounds of loud explosions as the pair scuttled around the street. Dirt was flying everywhere, the air was turbulent, and the crowd that was watching earlier had now retreated to a distance away.Zhang He\u2019s complexion had not changed, it was still red and glossy and he still had that faint smile on his face.On the other hand, Xiao Chen\u2019s hair was already messy, his face pale, and blood trickled out from the corner of his lips. He looked like he was in an extremely difficult situation but there was still traces of a faint smile on his face. He wiped the corner of his lips and tidied his hair a little. He looked at Zhang He in a relaxed and slightly provocative manner.Zhang He looked at Xiao Chen\u2019s provocative actions and felt his blood boiling, he almost vomited out a mouthful of fresh blood. However, Zhang He calmed down almost immediately. After all, he was not like Zhang Zeyang, he would not make those elementary mistakes. He smiled gently, \u201cYou are strong, looks like I underestimated you earlier. But what a pity, you ran into me. I will cripple your cultivation today. Let\u2019s see how cocky will you be then.\u201dAfter he said that, Zhang He waved his hands and took out a longsword, this longsword was actually a Spirit Weapon. It was about 2.33 meters long and it had a luster similar to\u00a0limpid autumn water. Zhang He\u2019s aura seemed to have changed after holding the sword.His aura turned sharp, radiating all around. A pressuring sword intent emerged, it was as incandescent as the sun. His entire being seemed like an unsheathed treasured sword.\u201cPu! Pu! Pu!\u201dZhang He took two steps forward ferociously and three streams of sword Qi shot out and attacked Xiao Chen from different angles. Xiao Chen did not have a weapon in his hands, thus he could not block them easily and was forced to retreat backward.Who knew, that sword Qi seemed to be able to track him, there was no way to avoid it. When Xiao Chen retreated, the sword Qi followed him closely, stabbing towards his throat!He was unable to avoid it, seeing the sword Qi about to stab his throat, there was a look of desperation on Xiao Chen\u2019s face...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Despite this, there was still a small gash left on his neck, with a trickle of blood flowing out.\u00a0How fortunate, Xiao Chen thought to himself.Seeing his attack being evaded, Zhang He had an astonished look on his face. He then immediately pursued Xiao Chen relentlessly, each sword strike faster than the one before. Xiao Chen was unable to find the time to even catch his breath.Xiao Chen\u2019s brain worked very hard, he knew that it was time for him to escape. Against Zhang He, who had a Spirit Weapon and wielded the powers of his Martial Spirit, he knew that he had no chance of winning. However, this battle had allowed him to learn of his limits. In a battle against a Martial Master, he would be at a big disadvantage. Xiao Chen knew that he had to work harder from now on.After evading another sword strike, Xiao Chen stomped the ground ferociously with his right foot and streams of Essence flowed to his leg. Using the force created by the impact, Xiao Chen retreated several meters. While he was in the air, he even shot out two clumps of Purple Thunder True Fire.\u201cYoung Master Zhang, I shall take my leave now, we will meet again in future.\u201d Xiao Chen laughed loudly as he turned around and dashed away frantically.Trying to run? It\u2019s too late, Zhang He laughed coldly in his heart. He was about to give chase when the two clumps of Purple Thunder True Fire reached his body. Zhang He casually slashed the fire with his sword, intending to scatter the purple flames.\u00a0Who would have guessed that when the purple flames touched the sword, the sword would catch on fire?\u00a0In an instant, the entire Spirit Weapon was enveloped by the purple flames. Zhang He was startled and hurriedly tossed his sword away.Those two clumps of purple flames looked ordinary but they were actually the result of Xiao Chen\u2019s quick thinking. He had almost compressed all the purple flames that his body could condense, this was not something that Zhang He could casually scatter with his sword.Zhang He looked somewhat fearfully at the burning sword on the ground.\u00a0If this strange flame had spread to his body, it would have been very scary.\u00a0When Zhang He thought of that, he shivered.\u201cBig brother, why did you let him go? Chase after him quickly!\u201d Zhang Zeyang said cluelessly.When he heard this, Zhang He felt very exasperated. He could no longer suppress the blood in his throat and vomited it out. When Zhang Zeyang saw this, he was so frightened that he went pale.Xiao Chen returned to the Xiao Chen in a somewhat sorry state. He had originally planned to purchase some herbs but he had not manage to do so. Xiao Chen laid on his bed and casually tossed the Azure Dragon Medicine Cauldron onto the table.\u00a0It seemed that he had to give up his thoughts of refining medicines for today.Lying on his bed, Xiao Chen kept thinking about every aspect of the battle with Zhang He today. If it was a battle with their bare hands, then he might not necessarily be at a disadvantage. However, Zhang He had a Spirit Weapon and had even manifested the powers of his Martial Spirit, leaving him helpless.Zhang He\u2019s Martial Spirit was a Clear Sky Sword. In this world, the Martial Spirit of many people were holy items that had previously existed. The Clear Sky Sword was an example of this, it was a sacred object that appeared ten thousand years ago and had already disappeared in the passing of time.His own Azure Dragon Martial Spirit was\u00a0an ancient holy beast. Martial Spirits that used to exist had a name that was common to the continent \u2014\u00a0Spiritual Martial Spirit.Spiritual\u00a0Martial Spirits\u00a0were able to communicate with spirits and its might was unfathomable. For example, a Medial Grade Martial Master like Zhang He could rely on the might of the Clear Sky Sword to\u00a0give off a sword Qi that only Martial Saints and above could emit,\u00a0causing Xiao Chen to be forced into a sorry state. This was the power of a Spiritual Martial Spirit.Then what was the special ability of his Azure Dragon Martial Spirit?\u00a0Xiao Chen was somewhat puzzled as he thought about this. After coming to this world, he had only been in a few battles and he had not actually used the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit yet. More specifically, he had not used the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit on his own accord and had completely relied on his Purple Thunder Divine Incantation to battle.Logically, his Azure Dragon Martial Spirit should not be inferior to Zhang He\u2019s Clear Sky Sword. How could he utilize the power of the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit?Spirit Weapon!After pondering for a long time, Xiao Chen finally thought of Spirit Weapons. He wanted to possess a Spirit Weapon. This was the only way to exhibit the power of the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit. Or else, it would be a waste of this ancient Holy Beast Martial Spirit. Furthermore, there was still a copious amount of Moonstones from the Thunder Emperor\u2019s cave that he had not used. The amount should be more than sufficient to forge a high ranked Spirit Weapon.When he thought of it, he instantly made up his mind. Xiao Chen got up and changed into a new set of clothing, he also washed away the filth and blood on his face. After leaving his small courtyard, he headed to the Xiao Clan\u2019s library.Since he was going to forge a Spirit Weapon, then he naturally had to find a Martial Technique for using Spirit Weapons. He had to look in Xiao Clan\u2019s library because it would be impossible for him to find a Martial Technique in the Compendium of Cultivation.The Xiao Clan\u2019s residence was very large and the library was located in the southeast area of the Xiao Clan\u2019s residence. It was a distance from the courtyard that Xiao Chen lived in. Xiao Chen lazily walked on the path of the Xiao Clan\u2019s residence, going past\u00a0a few\u00a0gardens and courtyards before arriving at the library.The Xiao Clan\u2019s library had three floors and there were many Cultivation Methods and Martial Techniques. The first floor contained ordinary Yellow Ranked Martial Techniques and Cultivation Methods; the second floor contained Profound Ranked Martial Techniques and Cultivation Methods; as for the third floor, it was very mysterious. Ordinary Xiao Clan disciples did not know what was in there.The techniques kept in the Xiao Clan library were the result of the accumulations of many years, its value was not to be underestimated. There were elite guards patrolling the surroundings. A cultivator in the Spirit Refinement realm did not have the qualifications to enter the library. Only after reaching the Martial Disciple realm, may one enter the first floor and only after entering the Martial Master realm may one may enter the second floor. In the past, Xiao Chen was only in the 9th Grade of Spirit Refinement, naturally, he could not enter. Now, after defeating Xiao Jian, no one would stop him even if he wanted to enter.The library had always been a bustling place and at this moment, there were many Xiao Clan disciples focused on looking at various Martial Techniques. When Xiao Chen entered, he attracted the gazes of all these people, causing them to start chatting with each other.\u201cLook, Xiao Chen is here\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is he here for? Isn\u2019t he only in the 9th Grade of Spirit Refinement? How did he get the qualifications to enter?\u201d\u201cYou pighead! If he can defeat Xiao Jian, then he must have already become a Martial Disciple. The guards would have stopped him from entering otherwise. Those guards are Martial Grand Masters.\u201d\u201cThis\u00a0trash\u00a0has now risen to prominence, you better keep your voices down. If he hears you, who knows what the consequences will be.\u201d\u2026\u2026Their voices may have been soft but Xiao Chen could still hear them. Xiao Chen found it funny and just ignored them, directly going to the bookshelves to look for Martial Techniques for weapons. This was his first time here and the library was very big, it took him quite some time before he managed to find the bookshelf for weapons-related Martial Techniques.\u201cThunderbolt Swordplay, Medial Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique, there are 13 moves to this swordplay, each stroke faster than the one before it. Use a speed as fast as a thunderbolt to kill the enemy.\u201d\u201cMountain Splitting Hack, Inferior Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique, when trained to the\u00a0great perfection\u00a0realm, it can split the mountains and separate the seas with one hack.\u201cRevolving Spear, Inferior Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique, focuses Essence on the body of the spear, creating a revolving force. Able to achieve unimaginable results in battle.\u201d\u2026...Xiao Chen kept reading book after book. The more he read, the less interested he was. The highest grade of Martial Techniques was only Medial Grade Yellow Ranked. There was not even a single Superior Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique. Furthermore, the descriptions were very exaggerated, they were only Yellow Ranked Martial Techniques. No matter how much they were trained in, it would be impossible to split the mountains and separate the seas or be as fast as a thunderbolt.Putting down a Yellow Ranked Martial Technique book, he noticed a book as he lowered his head. The book was covered in dust and in the corner on the bottom shelf. There were some blurred words that he noticed, instantly attracting his gaze.Heaven Ranked!Xiao Chen carefully looked around, after making sure that there was no one around, he quickly and carefully picked up the book. Xiao Chen felt incomparably joyful. Looks like he had days when he was lucky as well, there was actually a Heaven Ranked Martial Technique on the first floor of the library. Furthermore, no one had discovered it.Heaven Ranked Martial Technique \u2014 Dragon Subduing Slash. Xiao Chen slowly flipped the book open and read it, this Dragon Subduing Slash was an introductory saber technique. There was a total of 13 moves, every move requiring more Essence to exhibit than the one before. With Xiao Chen\u2019s current cultivation, he would not even be able to exhibit the first move \u2014 Return of the Azure Dragon.Xiao Chen carefully kept the Dragon Subduing Slash book, then he casually grabbed a Medial Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique before looking for the manager of the library \u2014 Xiao Jue. Xiao Jue was the second brother of his father, he had already become a Martial Grand Master many years ago. However, he had then suffered an injury which caused his cultivation to drop to Martial Master, thus he was sent by the Xiao Clan to manage the library.Looking at the Dragon Subduing Slash Xiao Chen handed over, Xiao Jue stared blankly for a while before saying: \u201cWhere did you find this Martial Technique?\u201dWere there some mysterious principles involved in this? Xiao Chen suppressed the suspicions he had in his heart and told Xiao Jue the truth of where he had found the Dragon Subduing Slash.Xiao Jue laughed loudly after hearing it, \u201cI have not seen this Martial Technique for quite a long time, so it was actually hidden there. Nephew Xiao Chen, you can\u2019t take this book out.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dXiao Jue replied with a slight tone of ridicule: \u201cDid you think that you had gotten lucky and found a Heaven Ranked Martial Technique that no one else discovered? That your strength would suddenly soar when you learned it, that you will be able to slaughter everyone and become unparalleled?\u201dXiao Chen, who had been seen through, said awkwardly: \u201cWhat is wrong with this book? Since it is a Heaven Rank Martial Technique, why can\u2019t the Xiao Clan disciples take it out?\u201dXiao Jue sighed in disappointment and frustration, \u201cWhen I was young, I asked the same question as you. Since it is a Heaven Rank Martial Technique, why can\u2019t the Xiao Clan disciples practice it?\u201dXiao Jue paused for a moment before sorrowfully continuing, \u201cThis Martial Technique can only be practiced by people who have the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit, anyone else would end up exploding and dying. However, the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit had not appeared in our Xiao Clan for a thousand years. Thus, this Martial Technique is like trash, taking it out will only cause harm to others.\u201dAzure Dragon again!Xiao Chen\u2019s heart beat very hard as he tried to maintain a poker face, \u201cSo, it is like this, then can I just take it back to reference it then return it? I promise not to practice it.\u201d\u201cThis is no problem, this book is just a copy, you can take it back and don\u2019t bother returning it. Or else, someone else might get tempted by it and get into trouble. However, Xiao Chen, you must remember to never attempt to practice it. There were many in the elder generations of the Xiao Clan who have tried and ended up exploding. There have been so many precedents of this.\u201dXiao Chen nodded his head and smile, \u201cI assure you I won\u2019t, second uncle, please do not worry. I shall take my leave first.\u201d\u201cSecond Uncle, why isn\u2019t there even a Profound Ranked Martial Technique on the second floor?\u201dXiao Chen was about to leave when he heard a familiar voice. The person who spoke was Xiao Jiao, who had just come from the second floor. Xiao Chen stopped in his tracks with some astonishment. Xiao Jian came from the second floor, this meant that he had broken through the bottleneck of peak Martial Disciple and was now a Martial Master, how surprising.Xiao Jian walked over, holding a few Martial Technique books, he had not expected to meet Xiao Chen here. Xiao Jian was surprised for awhile before he smiled and said: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to meet second brother here, are you here to look for Martial Techniques too?\u201dXiao Jian looked the same as he did before, he was dressed in a blue gi, looking very capable and experienced. The pride that used to show on his face had decreased somewhat but Xiao Chen could still see a trace of hatred hidden in his eyes.Looks like the matter with Xiao Jian has not ended yet.As though Xiao Jian could hear his thoughts, Xiao Jian slowly walked over and said in a low voice: \u201cThe duel between you and I has just begun. I will repay the shame from that day with interest.\u201d the final few words were slowly enunciated\u00a0through clenched teeth.Who humiliated who first? All these years, during the test of abilities, which one have you not humiliated me in? Have you ever thought of all the times that I have suffered because of that?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he was, he would not have held back while using Divine Thunder Break that day. But now, Xiao Jian had come to provoke him again, causing him to feel angry.\u00a0It\u2019s just the Martial Master realm, did he need to be so smug?Since they were right in front of Xiao Jue, Xiao Chen was not in a position to flare up. Instead, he just gently smiled and said: \u201cWait till you have the ability before you come and say those big words.\u201d Without waiting for Xiao Jian\u2019s reply, he turned and left.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dXiao Jiao stared at Xiao Chen\u2019s back as he left, his gaze turning incredibly cold as he tightly clenched his fist.\u00a0I, Xiao Jian, cannot lose to this trash again, regardless of the method!\u201cSecond Young Master, I have finally found you. The First Elder was looking for you everywhere.\u201dXiao Chen was about to go back when he met that maid who had informed him back then to attend that test of abilities. He felt that it was strange, why was the First Elder looking for him?He stopped in his tracks and looked at the maid that was sent by the First Elder, \u201cDo you know why the First Elder is looking for me?\u201dThe maid answered honestly: \u201cI am not sure about the details but the First Elder seemed to be very anxious, it should be something important.\u201dIn the past, this maid would have just ignored Xiao Chen and just left after passing on the message. Today, not only did she answered his question, her attitude was strangely humble.\u201cLead the way then.\u201d Xiao Chen said calmly. He did not bother with her change in attitude.The maid seemed a little nervous and on the way there she kept mumbling to herself. She did not dare to say anything to Xiao Chen. After she brought Xiao Chen to the First Elder\u2019s Courtyard, she immediately took her leave.When he entered the courtyard, Xiao Chen saw the First Elder sitting by the stone table in the middle. The First Elder waved at him and Xiao Chen hurriedly walked over. Since Xiao Xiong was in closed door training, the First Elder held the the highest position. Xiao Chen did not dare to show a sloppy attitude.Seeing Xiao Chen standing in front of the table, the First Elder smiled gently, \u201cHave a seat, we are family, there is no need to be so reserved.\u201dXiao Chen thanked him and sat down. Then he asked cautiously: \u201cI wonder why First Elder was looking for me?\u201dXiao Qiang just smiled and picked up the teapot on the stone table to pour Xiao Chen a cup of tea, \u201cThese tea leaves are the best in the south, it is very difficult to buy this in Qizi County, try it!\u201dXiao Chen knew nothing about tea, thus he just took a sip before asking again: \u201cFirst Elder, why were you looking for me...\u201d\u201cNo rush, let me thank you for Yulan\u2019s matter first.\u201d Xiao Qiang interrupted Xiao Chen. \u201cThat girl has been staying on the mountain for years and has always refused to come down. If it were not for you, she would have never come down.\u201d\u201cI heard from Yulan that your Martial Spirit is a purple flame. Can I take a look?\u201dXiao Chen nodded his head and a ball of purple flames appeared atop his hands. It continually danced and emitted a strange glow.Xiao Qing focused heavily on the Purple Thunder True Fire in Xiao Chen\u2019s hands. He then raised his right hand and gathered some Essence. After a moment, a suction force could be felt. When Xiao Chen felt this suction force, he did not resist it and just let Xiao Qiang pull over some of his purple flames.\u201cZizi!\u201dLooking at the flame that continually consumed his Essence, Xiao Qiang said in satisfaction: \u201cThis flame is indeed tyrannical. No wonder Xiao Jian got distracted by this. Even with my Martial Grand Master cultivation, it would take quite a bit of effort to extinguish this flame.\u201d\u201cFirst Elder is just being modest, with First Elder\u2019s abilities, this flame would not be able to hurt you at all.\u201dSeeing Xiao Chen being so humble, Xiao Qiang felt very satisfied. He casually waved his hand and extinguished the flame, \u201cThis flame is extremely pure, you can try being an alchemist in the future.\u201dThe alchemists in the Tianwu Continent needed to use fire that came from\u00a0their Martial Spirit, this was the basic requirement. Their Martial Spirit needed to be a fire attributed Spirit Beast or Holy Item. If it was as pure as Xiao Chen\u2019s Purple Thunder True Fire, then it was the best. However, the First Elder did not know that Xiao Chen\u2019s Purple Thunder True Fire was not his actual Martial Spirit.Xiao Chen nodded his head, \u201cI have thought of that before already. However, the requirements for becoming an alchemist is just too high. Even in the whole Mohe City, there are no second grade alchemist or higher. It would not be easy to get started.\u201dXiao Chen\u2019s words were not entirely false.\u00a0If an alchemist took him in as a disciple, then that would be the best, he would be able to learn faster. However, even without a high ranked alchemist guiding him, he would still be able to use what he had learned from the Compendium of Cultivation. It would not be too difficult for him to refine pills.Xiao Qiang muttered to himself irresolutely before saying: \u201cI have a set of books on the introduction to alchemy, I will get someone to send them to you later.\u201dIntroductory books on alchemy were not particularly precious but Xiao Chen was still quite interested in seeing how alchemy worked in this world. Thus, he wanted to take a look. He smiled and said: \u201cIn that case, thank you First Elder.\u201dAfter speaking for so long, The First Elder still had not told Xiao Chen his true purpose in calling him over.\u201cYoung Master Xiao, In this year\u2019s Promise of Ten Years\u2019 duels, I would like you to compete, what do you think?\u201dXiao Chen was still trying to guess the First Elder\u2019s purpose for calling him over when he gave Xiao Chen the answer. It was as if he could read Xiao Chen\u2019s mind.The Promise of Ten Years\u2019 duels, this involved the Seven Horn Mountain which the Xiao Clan relied on for survival. If they lost the duels, then the Xiao Clan would become a second rate clan in Mohe City. When that happened, those clans that had bad blood with the Xiao Clan would definitely take action.Let's not even mention the problem of whether Xiao Chen could escape on his own or not. Regardless of the previous Xiao Chen or the current one, they both had\u00a0feelings\u00a0for the Xiao Clan. If he left, then what would happen to Xiao Yulan? To Xiao Chen\u2019s father? Now that he had occupied another person\u2019s body, he should shoulder some responsibility. Xiao Chen may have been a shut-in but he still was a responsible person.Thus, for this Promise of Ten Years, even if the First Elder did not say anything, Xiao Chen would still do his best to help the Xiao Clan to overcome this crisis. After this, then he could be considered even with the Xiao Clan.When Xiao Qiang saw Xiao Chen become silent, he thought that Xiao Chen was not willing to agree, \u201cThis is actually you father\u2019s idea, he knows that you have condensed your Martial Spirit and even defeated Xiao Jian, he is happy for you.\u201d\u201cMy father? Isn\u2019t he in closed door training?\u201d Xiao Chen asked with some suspicions.Xiao Qing smiled, \u201cEven if he is in closed-door training, he is still human, he needs to eat and drink. I had told the clan head then and he did not seem surprised. He even suggested for \u00a0you take part in the duels of the Promise of Ten Years.He didn\u2019t\u00a0feel surprised? Could it be that he knew that I would condense my Martial Spirit? And that my Martial Spirit is the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit? However, from the words of the First Elder, it doesn\u2019t seem likely, or else he would not have thought that my Purple Thunder True Fire is my Martial Spirit.\u201cThat\u2019s right, First Elder, when will my father come out? He has been in closed door training for three years already, right? Even a regular person would not take this long to breakthrough to Martial Saint.\u201d Seeing an opportunity to obtain news about Xiao Xiong, Xiao Chen immediately asked this question that he had been suppressing in his heart for so long.On the road of Martial Cultivation, there were three important hurdles. The first was to condense a Martial Spirit, as long as one could condense a Martial Spirit before the age of ten, then he would definitely reach the Martial Grand Master realm. It would just be a matter of time. The second hurdle was when they tried to break through to Martial Saint. If this hurdle could be passed, then they would definitely reach the Martial King realm, or else they would be stuck in the Martial Grand Master realm forever.The final hurdle was breaking into Martial Emperor, this hurdle was ethereal and mysterious. Many people said that after this realm, it was the legendary Martial God. However, since there were no records of Martial Gods, no one could confirm if this rumor was true.Xiao Qiang took a sip of tea and said seriously: \u201cThe Cultivation Method your father cultivates is different from others. Good preparation is the key to success. Once he breaks through, he will immediately become a peak Martial Saint. When this happens, not to mention Mohe City, our Xiao Clan would have a place in the whole Qizi County.\u201d\u201cOf course, all of these things can only happen under one condition, which is if the Seven Horn Mountain remains under our control. The strength of the Zhang Clan had soared rapidly these few years, they are even more unyielding than our Xiao Clan and cannot be underestimated. If they obtain the rights to Seven Horn Mountain, then the outcome for our Xiao Clan would be very tragic. Thus, Second Young Master, please consider taking part in this Promise of Ten Years very seriously.\u201dThe First Elder truly had a way with his words, after speaking for a bit, he could turn the topic back to this. Xiao Chen thought very hard and fast. After he had considered this for a little, he felt that he could make use of this opportunity to seek some benefits from the First Elder. After all, Xiao Chen just so happened to be lacking a Spirit Weapon.He then put on a bitter face, \u201cFirst Elder, it is not that I do not want to agree but look at my empty hands, I don\u2019t even have a Spirit Weapon.\u201dXiao Qiang smiled, \u201cYou have a big appetite, the first thing you ask for is a Spirit Weapon? Do you think Spirit Weapons\u00a0are so easily obtained? Even Xiao Jian only managed to obtain one after reaching the Martial Master realm.He had to reach the Martial Master realm to obtain a Spirit Weapon? There was such a rule?\u201cOnly by reaching the Martial Master realm can one have a Spirit Weapon, this is the rule of our Xiao Clan. However, I do have a few personal Spirit Weapons, you can pick one.\u201d The First Elder suddenly changed the topic. This gave Xiao Chen a surprise since he already given up hope.Xiao Qiang waved his hands casually and four Spirit Weapon appeared on the table. Another Spatial Ring! Xiao Chen envied the grayish-white ring on the First Elder\u2019s finger. When his Purple Thunder Divine Incantation reached the second layer and he learned to forge equipment, he would definitely make a Spatial treasure for himself.Xiao Chen turned his gaze to the four Spirit Weapon on the stone table and carefully examined them. Three of them were swords and only one of them was a saber-shaped Spirit Weapon. However, these few Spirit Weapon did not have much of a glow to them, after holding them in his hands, he could determine that these were Inferior Grade Yellow Ranked Spirit Weapons.Inferior Grade Yellow Ranked Spirit Weapon, this was the trashiest quality of Spirit Weapons. Xiao Chen felt that it was a pity but he could not let an unhappy expression show on his face. Usually, when a regular person obtained a Spirit Weapon, they would feel incredibly happy, how could they feel that it was a pity? In order to prevent the First Elder from feeling suspicious, Xiao Chen had to act happy.\u201cHow is it? Have you chosen one?\u201d Seeing Xiao Chen\u2019s happy appearance, Xiao Qiang felt quite satisfied.Xiao Chen picked up the saber shaped Spirit Weapon, he saw that there were two words on the handle \u2014 Lunar Shadow. He said: \u201cI\u2019ll take this Lunar Shadow.\u201dThe Dragon Subduing Slash required a saber to be used, Xiao Chen had no other choice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 23:\u00a0Meteor BurstThe Xiao Clan, within Xiao Chen\u2019s isolated courtyard.In the Xiao Residence, no one was allowed to have their own courtyard except for certain individuals. An individual such as an elder in the clan, an important guest, or a\u00a0disciple of direct descent\u00a0like Xiao Chen could have their personal courtyard.Xiao Chen carefully observed the Inferior Grade Yellow Ranked Spirit Weapon \u2014 Lunar Shadow. The saber was 1.2 meters long and two fingers wide.\u00a0Its blade was sleek and streamlined. It seemed somewhat similar to a reaper's scythe but it was not as long.Shutting his eyes, he sank his consciousness into his body. Xiao Chen carefully inspected the power contained within the saber. A faint energy came from the saber and entered Xiao Chen\u2019s body, slowly heading toward his Dantian.Slowly, this thread-like energy flowed into the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit in his Dantian. A stream of Essence followed this thread back and entered the saber.Xiao Chen was incomparably happy because this Essence that came from the Azure Dragon was even clearer, purer, and more tyrannical than before. Perhaps it was because the Spirit Weapon was of a low quality but the pure Essence could only travel via that thin thread to connect with the saber. Xiao Chen could clearly feel that only ten percent of the energy from his Martial Spirit had entered the saber.If his Spirit Weapon was of a higher quality, then this thread of energy would definitely be thicker. The Essence that could be sent back would definitely be more than ten percent.He opened his eyes and carefully observed this strange situation. Xiao Chen held Lunar Shadow and brandished it for a while. An electrical glow surrounded the blade and the shadow of the Azure Dragon could be seen flashing\u00a0on\u00a0the blade\u2019s surface from time to time.\u201cHa!\u201dXiao Chen lightly shouted and leaped up ferociously, hacking thrice with the Lunar Shadow. At that moment, something strange happened. Just as Xiao Chen\u2019s strength was\u00a0exhausted, the Martial Spirit in his body suddenly sent out a stream of energy. The Azure Dragon shadow on his blade suddenly discharged a surge energy. This caused the slowly descending Xiao Chen to rise up abruptly.Rising on this energy, Xiao Chen twisted his body in a strange manner and his body actually rose higher again. An unending stream of matchless and surging energy exuded from the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit in his body!\u201cChi! Chi! Chi!\u201dHe hacked out ferociously another three times. There was a flash of electrical light and a dragon\u2019s roar Even the\u00a0clouds\u00a0thousands of meters above seemed to rumble as the thunder echoed in the distance.After the three hacks, Xiao Chen\u2019s body rose even higher. At this moment, he was already more than 30 meters above the ground. This was the first time that Xiao Chen had been so high in the air, he could not help but feel anxious and horrified.However, the desire to explore the unknown\u00a0occupied\u00a0Xiao Chen\u2019s mind. He was filled with a prideful heroic spirit and vaguely wanted to view the land from the heavens.\u00a0How high can I, Xiao Chen, soar up into the sky!\u201cHua! Hua! Hua!\u201dXiao Chen hacked another\u00a0three\u00a0more times and his body rose by another five meters. He could now see half of the Xiao Residence. It was a good thing that Xiao Chen\u2019s courtyard was quite isolated. Otherwise, given his current altitude, he would have been noticed by someone long ago.He repeated his actions another two times, Xiao Chen\u2019s body was now seventy or eighty meters above the ground. His Essence was already half exhausted. Xiao Chen did not dare to expend anymore Essence. If he ran out of Essence, he would die or at least be severely injured when he fell.On the spur of the moment, he sheathed his saber and plummeted downwards like a meteor. A formless Azure Dragon enveloped Xiao Chen as he blasted through the sky, ferociously smashing towards the ground.The wind howled in Xiao Chen\u2019s ear as he shouted loudly. He used the momentum of his fall to send out a lightning fast strike with his saber. Using that boundless vigor, this strike was heavier than 1000 jins of force, it had great momentum and had a magnificent and unblockable force![Tl note: 1000 jin is 500kg, but I left it as jin cause 1000 jin looks nicer than 500kg]\u201cBang!\u201dThe ground was blasted apart and a huge crater could be seen at the point of impact. Countless rock fragments were blasted into the air, filling the sky. Upon contact with the wind, the rock fragments immediately turned into powder. In an instant, dust was sent flying everywhere, the entire front yard was\u00a0decimated.Xiao Chen\u2019s four limbs were spread out as he laid on the ground. He gasped for air with deep breaths. His emotions were hard to describe, originally he had just wanted to test out the might of the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit when using a Spirit Weapon.He did not expect that he would accidentally comprehend a strong Martial Technique. This Martial Technique was at the very least a Profound Grade technique. Furthermore, this Martial Technique was created by Xiao Chen himself, it was unique in the Tianwu Continent. How could he not be excited?He had to think of a name.\u00a0Let\u2019s call it Meteor Burst, smashing against the ground like a meteor, bursting forth with the explosive force of a meteorite.Meteor Burst, Meteor Burst. He repeated this name a few times, the more he said it, the more satisfied he felt.However, was this Meteor Burst truly unique in this world? Actually, it was not.\u00a0The Azure Dragon Martial Spirit was very mysterious, the time when it existed was at least thousands of years ago.Dragons were able to change their size at will. They could fly and swim; when they were large, they were able\u00a0to swallow clouds and blow out fog. When they chose to be small, they were able to be hidden from all things; they could fly to the nine heavens or hide beneath the waves.Ascending from the ground and soaring into the skies, this was a very normal thing for the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit. The Azure Dragon Martial Spirit had many mystical abilities and Martial Techniques. However, due to its mysterious nature, the Xiao Clan had lost the ability to pass them down long ago. The Meteor Burst that Xiao Chen had executed earlier was actually a long lost Azure Dragon Martial Spirit exclusive Martial Technique\u00a0\u2014 Descending Divine Dragon Chop.This kind of Holy Beast exclusive Martial Technique was very well preserved in the other clans with Holy Beast Martial Spirit bloodlines. They did not have to figure it out by themselves like Xiao Chen. When they reached a certain cultivation realm, they could just go to the library to retrieve it easily they were a lot more fortunate than Xiao Chen.After resting on the ground for a while, Xiao Chen slowly recovered some of his strength. His face was a little pale, these strikes had exhausted too much of his Essence. After struggling for a little, he managed to stand up and tidy himself up a little. He then looked at the entrance to the courtyard.He could\u00a0feel\u00a0the vibrations of footsteps as a person slowly walking over. The Essence in that person\u2019s body was weak, it seemed like the person was not a cultivator. After he realized that, he let his guard down.\u201cAi! What\u2026 What happened here...\u201dAfter a short moment, a girl dressed in a maid uniform appeared in Xiao Chen\u2019s vision. The maid looked at the dusty front yard that was full of potholes and cried out.Looking at the maid in front of him, Xiao Chen frowned, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? Who sent you here?\u201dThe maid looked at Xiao Chen who was covered in dust, he looked like a\u00a0mudman. She found it funny in her heart and said in a quiet voice: \u201cReplying to Second Young Master, this servant\u2019s name is Bao`er. The First Elder sent me to deliver this book to you.\u201dXiao Chen walked over, received the book, and took a look. It was the introductory alchemy book that the First Elder said he would give him. His expression turned warmer and he smiled, \u201cThanks.\u201dAfter thanking her, Xiao Chen turned and headed to the bedroom. He wanted to take a new set of clothes and bathe. He felt very uncomfortable with all the dirt sticking to him. However, the maid called Bao`er did not leave. Instead, she slowly followed him.Xiao Chen felt that it was a little strange, he smiled as he turned around, \u201cWhy are you not leaving yet? Do you intend to stay here and bathe with me?\u201dBao`er blushed, her entire face turning a bright red as she muttered in a soft voice, \u201cThe First Elder told me to come here and serve Second Young Master. He said to do whatever Second Young Master says. If Second Young Master wants Bao`er to take a bath with him then Bao`er does not dare to disobey...\u201dWhat! He had only said it casually but this girl was actually willing to accompany him in the bath...In Xiao Chen\u2019s memory, he did not recall that he ever had a maid that served him. To think that the First Elder would not only give him a Spirit Weapon upon request but he would also give him books on alchemy. In the end, he even sent him a maid to serve him. However, Xiao Chen enjoyed this idea.It was a pity that it was not a time to enjoy himself. If he gave into lust, then he might stumble on his cultivation path. There were many experts in the Tianwu Continent. Even if you didn\u2019t mention those from far away, he was not even able to deal with Zhang He from the Zhang Clan. How could he lust after this little beauty during this time?He could only put up with this and become a wizard. Only when he finally stood on the peak of the cultivation world would he stay and enjoy the scenery. It would definitely be something that this small Moho City could not compare to.\u00a0How could, I, Xiao Chen, be confined to Mohe City.[Tl notes: I guess he is referring to the saying that if one remains a virgin after 30, he would become a wizard. Damn, I\u2019m getting close to being a wizard]After thinking for a while, Xiao Chen shook his head, \u201cI just said that jokingly, don\u2019t take it seriously. I will not ask you to accompany me to bathe.\u201dBao`er\u2019s face was already red, after saying those shameful things, her heart was palpitating. She then said in a soft voice: \u201cThen does Young Master have any other instructions? Bao`er is now Young Master\u2019s exclusive maid. Aside from serving Young Master, there is nothing else for me to do.\u201dXiao Chen scratched his head, unsure of how to handle this situation. This was a tough question. If she did not bathe with him or sleep with him,\u00a0what else could she do?If Bao`er knew what Xiao Chen was thinking, she would definitely be very\u00a0infuriated. Maids did not exist just to sleep with their masters, they had many other things to do. Only an Neet\u00a0from the 21st century like Xiao Chen would think this way.\u201cRight, help me to go to the city to purchase some herbs.\u201d said Xiao Chen joyfully after he thought about i for a bit. Too many things had happened today, he was too lazy to make this trip. Coincidentally, there was now a maid that could help him with this.After the battle with Zhang He and comprehending the Meteor Burst, he could obviously feel that his Essence capacity was insufficient. Whether be it executing a strong Martial Technique or maintaining a high intensity Purple Thunder True Fire, he could not sustain it for a long time.This was a serious problem, if he had to undergo a long battle or refine a high-leveled pill, his insufficient Essence could be his fatal weakness. The only solution to this was to step up his cultivation and quickly cultivate the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation to the 2nd layer. That way, he would be able to store up more Essence in his body.When increasing his cultivation speed, aside from hardwork, medicinal pills were a necessity as well.Xiao Chen went to get some paper and ink from the study and began to write. Although he was not used to writing with a brush, the original owner of this body was no stranger to it as he was an original resident of this world.After he finished writing, Xiao Chen blew gently on the paper, trying to dry the ink. He was satisfied with his calligraphy. Xiao Chen then took out his personal seal and gave them to Bao`er. He smiled and said, \u201cJust follow the list on the paper to purchase the herbs, they are not some rare herbs and should be easily found in ordinary herbs stores in Mohe City. Use my seal to retrieve some money from the\u00a0accounts\u00a0branch. You can use the remainder to purchase some\u00a0rouge or other makeup products\u00a0for yourself, there is no need to return the change.\u201dBao`er received the seal while feeling somewhat dumbfounded, she said in disbelief: \u201cYoung Master, you are asking Bao`er to run some errands?\u201dThe work of a maid was normally to serve tea or water, tidy the house or assist their masters in dressing up. Sometimes, there might be special requests to sleep with their master or accompany them for a bath, these were very normal too.However, running errands, this was normally done by the male stewards. Furthermore, Xiao Chen had a very poor reputation in the Xiao Clan, Bao`er did not expect that Xiao Chen would only ask her to run some errands.If you don\u2019t run errands, then what can you do? Sleep with me?\u00a0Xiao Chen smiled, \u201cWhy? Are you not able to do it? If you can\u2019t then I will just find someone else.\u201dBao`er immediately reacted, her small and dainty face filled with a smile as she said joyfully: \u201cI can do it. I definitely can do it, I\u2019ll go do it now. Young Master, rest assured, Bao`er will accomplish this task beautifully.\u201dLooking at Bao`er disappearing in an instant, Xiao Chen laughed in satisfaction. It was not bad having a maid, at least he did not have to bother with things like running errands in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 24:\u00a0Refining MedicinesAfter he took a bath, Xiao Chen changed into a fresh set of clothes. He laid on his bed and began to read the introductory alchemy book. To lie down and read was a habit he gained from his original world, it was something he did not bother to change even after he came to this world.\u00a0If someone from this world saw him now, they would be very shocked.Alchemist was the most respected profession in the Tianwu Continent. This respect came from their\u00a0medicines that could heal wounds, their miraculous pills that could change the body\u2019s talent for cultivation, and the pills that sped up the speed of cultivation.To every cultivator, alchemy held a certain level of attraction. Alchemists were rare and they were highly demanded, this naturally caused the profession to be respected far more than the others.Xiao Chen flipped through the book page by page. This introductory book\u00a0was not very thick, it only contained tens of pages. Xiao Chen skimmed through the book and finished it in no time.It was truly just an introductory book, there was no solid content inside and it only provided a brief preview to alchemy. However, Xiao Chen still benefited from this, as he now had a rough understanding of the alchemy in this world.Alchemist in the Tianwu Continent could be separated into seven ranks, with one being the lowest and seven being the highest. All of the ranking examinations were conducted by the Alchemist Association.To become an alchemist, there were three prerequisites. First, one needed a fire attributed Martial Spirit or a fire attributed technique. In other words, they needed to have the ability to condense a flame.The second prerequisite was to do with one\u2019s knowledge of medicinal herbs. This condition required very solid fundamentals and an individual had to have a very thorough understanding of medicinal herbs and their usage. There were no shortcuts to this, it could only could be accomplished by rote learning.The third prerequisite was Spiritual Awareness. This was the vaguest condition and it seemed very enigmatic. Spiritual Awareness was similar but distinctly different to perception.Even if an individual had walked very far on the road of cultivation, they still might not be able to awaken their Spiritual Awareness. Cultivation and Spiritual Awareness were not directly linked.\u00a0There were some individuals who had awakened their Spiritual Awareness and possessed a very great Spiritual Awareness. However, they did not manage to have any accomplishments in terms of cultivation.The so-called Spiritual Awareness referred to the intuition,\u00a0senses\u00a0and Mental Connection of the alchemist. The most important of these was their Mental Connection to medicinal ingredients. If their Mental Connection could be fast, stable, and meticulous, then they would be able to go far on the path of alchemy.Xiao Chen thought about these three prerequisites and checked himself. He had the Purple Thunder True Fire, thus he had naturally cleared the first prerequisite. Additionally, he had memorized the chapter on refining pills in the Compendium of Cultivation and was able to recall the information on medicinal ingredients in detail.After reading the Compendium of Cultivation for three years, he was already as familiar with it as the back of his palm. Furthermore, he had discovered that the medicinal ingredients of this world were the same as those recorded in the Compendium of Cultivation. Thus, Xiao Chen had cleared the second prerequisite too.As for the third prerequisite, it seemed very\u00a0mysterious. The Compendium of Cultivation did not have any records of Spiritual Awareness in the chapter on refining pills. However, he was not worried. After all, the alchemy recorded in the Compendium of Cultivation was slightly different from this world\u2019s. Even if he did not have Spiritual Awareness or only had a weak Spiritual Awareness, he was still confident that he could learn to refine pills. If he could not become an alchemist of this world, he would follow the method recorded on the Compendium of Cultivation instead.Furthermore, the pills recorded on the Compendium of Cultivation were more profound and mysterious than the pills of this world. For example, he intended to refine the Fasting Pill. This pill would removed the need to eat or drink for a month after its consumption.\u00a0This kind of effect was unheard of in this world....When the sky had almost darkened, Bao`er finally returned with a big bag of medicinal herbs. After he saw her sweat covered and dusty appearance, Xiao Chen felt somewhat disturbed. This girl did not look older than fourteen or fifteen years old. In his original world, she would still be in middle school.He said in an apologetic tone: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I forgot to tell you that I did not urgently need these medicinal herbs and that you could take your time.\u201dAs Bao`er wiped her sweat with her small hands, she heard these words and was stunned.\u00a0Did I hear incorrectly? The famous prodigal son of the Xiao Clan actually apologized to a maid?When Xiao Chen was still trash, he had a very bad reputation. Although he defeated Xiao Jian and proved that he was not trash, they still did not have a good impression of Xiao Chen. Everyone said that he was a vile person that was intoxicated by success, becoming even more overbearing than before. There were even rumors that he had taught everyone who had humiliated him in the past a lesson. Bao`er had heard plenty of these rumors.If Xiao Chen knew of these rumors, he would definitely become incomparably depressed. When he saw Bao`er\u2019s stunned expression, Xiao Chen felt a little worried and asked in a soft voice: \u201cAre you alright? Are you not feeling well?\u201dBao`er quickly recovered her wits. She was not used to Xiao Chen\u2019s tone, thus she blushed and replied in a soft voice: \u201cBao`er is fine, many thanks for Young Master\u2019s concern.\u201dXiao Chen relaxed, \u201cGo back first, there is nothing else for you to do for now.\u201dWhen Bao`er heard these words, she looked at Xiao Chen in surprise and said nervously: \u201cIs Young Master chasing me away? The First Elder said that I am now your personal maid and will stay here from now on. If you chase me out, the First Elder will think that I did not serve you well and will punish me.\u201dXiao Chen did not expect such a situation. These servants and maids were all orphans or the children of poor families. They had already been sold away. Even if they were beaten to death as a punishment, the offender would not be held responsible. Although the Xiao Clan was not that strict, there would still be some form of punishment.Xiao Chen frowned, he had never been in such a situation before. There was\u00a0plenty of space\u00a0in Xiao Chen\u2019s courtyard but he had too many secrets. Having a stranger by his side made him feel uneasy.After thinking for a long time, Xiao Chen did not manage to think of a solution that would benefit both sides. Looking at the pitiful Bao`er, Xiao Chen\u2019s heart softened, \u201cStay here first then, there is an empty side room in the east wing, you can stay there tonight.\u201dBao`er said joyfully: \u201cBao`er thanks the Second Young Master, I will go and prepare supper for Second Young Master now.\u201dXiao Chen looked on helplessly as Bao`er left and shook his head. He then turned his attention to the medicinal herbs she brought back and inspected them carefully.Twenty saffron, fifty star anise, twenty spearmints, twenty Tiger Paw Grass...Xiao Chen carefully counted them one by one. This girl was quite capable, she had brought back the exact amount that he had requested. Xiao Chen smiled to himself as he picked up a stalk of Tiger Paw Grass to examine it carefully.The topmost part of the foot long grass had four purplish green leaves. As he looked at this stalk of Tiger Paw Grass, that was no more than ten years old, he felt quite puzzled. Xiao Chen thought,\u00a0what is this Spiritual Awareness? How do I make a Mental Connection with a herb?He held the herb gently in his hands and closed his eyes as he sank his consciousness downwards. His consciousness followed his Essence as it slowly moved towards his right hand. His Essence left his body and wrapped around the herb gently. However, his consciousness was stuck in his body, hindered by the skin and flesh of his palm. It was unable to break out of his body.Even after he attempted a few times, his consciousness was still unable to make any kind of connection with the Tiger Paw Grass. Consciousness and Spiritual Awareness were quite different. Just as Xiao Chen was able to give up, his consciousness that was hovering around his palm suddenly managed to catch a hold of a strange green energy net.There were many small threads of energy that flowed into his body via the Essence from the green energy net. It rapidly connected together with his consciousness and a green space immediately appeared in Xiao Chen\u2019s\u00a0consciousness.Within this green space, there\u00a0was a complicated network of threads,\u00a0it looked like a complex maze. Streams of this green energy extended everywhere in this green space. The energy then firmly connected with Xiao Chen\u2019s consciousness. In that instant, Xiao Chen felt as though he could feel the Tiger Paw Grass\u2019 breath and pulse. It was a very mysterious feeling.Xiao Chen felt incomparably joyfully, this must be that Spiritual Awareness! Within that firm connection, he felt as if the herb was part of him. Under such a state, he would be able to bring his understanding and control of the herb to a deeper level. During a refinement, he would be able to accomplish twice the effect with half the effort. It was no wonder that Spiritual Awareness was a requirement to becoming a\u00a0good\u00a0alchemist.As he withdrew his consciousness, a stream of green energy traveled from the meridians in his hand to his sea of consciousness. After the green energy circulated a few times, it formed a green sphere and merged with Xiao Chen\u2019s consciousness.He was puzzled by this green sphere in his sea of consciousness. However, he decided not to bother with this sphere. With his rudimentary understanding of the alchemy of this world, he probably would not understand anything.He tossed aside his bewilderment as he opened his eyes and looked at the Tiger Paw Grass once again. He now had a deeper understanding of the herb, its root also had many medicinal properties. It was not like what was written in the book wrote, which stated that only the leaves were useful. With this deeper understanding, he was even more confident in his ability to refine pills later.Taking out the Azure Dragon medicine cauldron, Xiao Chen condensed the Purple Thunder True Fire and began his first attempt at refinement, he aimed to refine a Fasting Pill.In the Compendium of Cultivation, the Fasting Pill was among the pills of the lowest grade in the Immortal World. Only a few cultivators who had not reach a realm where they did not need to eat would take this pill. Thus, it was very suitable for his usage.Xiao Chen placed the Tiger Paw Grass into the Purple Thunder True Fire and carefully started to refine it. He controlled the Purple Thunder True Fire\u2019s strength attentively. Xiao Chen did not dare to be even slightly careless.The four green leaves quickly melted to become four clear drops of green liquid. This green liquid continuously boiled in the cauldron. Xiao Chen took out a porcelain bottle he had prepared earlier.\u00a0With a flick of his finger, he poured the liquid into the bottle.Next up, Xiao Chen focused his gaze on the unmelted root. Before he awakened his Spiritual Awareness, he would have treated this root as garbage and thrown it out. Now that he knew of its medicinal properties, he naturally would not throw it out.The roots were tougher than the leaves, thus he had to raise the temperature of his flames. Xiao Chen slowly increased the strength of the Purple Thunder True Fire. Controlling this flame seemed easy but it was very tiring. Furthermore, it tested his abilities to control his flame to its extremes.If the flame was too small, it would not be able to extract the medicinal liquid. If it was too big, the medicinal liquid would be burned. Only at that perfect size could he successfully extract the medicinal liquid. It was a good thing that the Compendium of Cultivation had described this very clearly. As long as he was careful, it should not be too hard to achieve.After he extracted five drops of green liquid from the roots, the table was filled up with some waste products. Xiao Chen quickly took out another five stalks of Tiger Paw Grass to refine. However, he was not as fortunate this time. Even when he knew how much to increase the size of the flames by, he still damaged two stalks of the Tiger Paw Grass.It was a good thing that Xiao Chen had anticipated this situation and had gotten Bao`er to purchase two times the materials that he needed. All in all, he managed to extract fifty drops of medicinal liquid from the Tiger Paw Grass before he stopped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Next up was to extract the medicinal liquid from three other medicinal herbs.After taking a small break, Xiao Chen retrieved a saffron and held it in his hands. He tried to use his Spiritual Awareness to establish a mental connection with it.He focused his attention and the green sphere in his sea of consciousness took on the shape of a brook-like, long, and jade-green line. It traveled through the meridians in his arms and exited his body. The green line, which was invisible to the naked eye, made a connection to the brightly-colored saffron.Instantly, a bright red space appeared within Xiao Chen\u2019s consciousness, as though it was right in front of his eyes. This time, Xiao Chen gained a deeper understanding of this medicinal herb\u2019s inner space.Those flowing red threads should be the medicinal properties of the saffron. The area that had the densest amount of threads was the place with the most medicinal properties. Thus, he could afford to be careless when it came to the other areas.After a while, Xiao Chen opened his eyes and rescinded this strange state. After experiencing this mental connection, he now had a rough understanding of the sphere in his sea of consciousness.The green sphere could be a Spiritual Core consolidated after he awakened his\u00a0Spiritual Awareness. However, he did not know what\u00a0level of aptitude\u00a0this Spiritual Core, which was as small as a green pea, was considered to be at.Gathering his thoughts, Xiao Chen circulated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation once again, condensing the Purple Thunder True Fire. He began to extract the medicinal liquid in the saffron, extracting a total of fifty drops of red medicinal liquid. Following that, he extracted the medicinal liquid of the star anise and spearmint, both of them yielding fifty drops of medicinal liquid each.Looking at the four porcelain bottles on the table, Xiao Chen took a breather and wiped the sweat off his forehead. The first step in refining the Fasting Pill had finally been completed. That alone had actually already exhausted half of all the Essence in his body..The second step was to form the pill. It required the supplementation of an enormous amount of Essence. If he came up deficient in Essence whilst in the midst of this step, everything would be for naught. Xiao Chen could only temporarily give up on proceeding with the second step and circulated his cultivation technique to slowly restore the exhausted Essence.Essence! Essence!At this moment, Xiao Chen desired nothing more than a larger capacity for Essence. If he had a sufficient reserve of Essence, then this would never have been an issue in the first place. He was only attempting to refine the most basic medicinal pill. If he were to try refining a pill of a higher grade, he would not even be able to last through the first step.After half an hour, Xiao Chen stopped cultivating. The Essence in his body had been fully restored, which was now sufficient for him to carry on with the second step of cultivation.Picking up the Azure Dragon medicinal cauldron, Xiao Chen condensed the Purple Thunder True Fire and thrust it into the opening for fire on the Azure Dragon medicinal cauldron. The purple fire burned ferociously in the cauldron. First of all, he poured the Tiger Paw Grass medicinal liquid in.Under the\u00a0purification\u00a0of the Purple Thunder True Fire, the viscous liquid continued to churn, giving off a \u2018Zi Zi\u2019 sound. The medicine cauldron began to give off a faint fragrance. Xiao Chen mentally kept track of the time and poured the second medicinal liquid in after a minute.After four minutes, all the medicinal liquids in the four porcelain bottles were emptied into the medicinal cauldron. Xiao Chen placed the cauldron lid on and continued to supply Essence to the Purple Thunder True Fire in the medicinal cauldron.An invisible thread connected to the Purple Thunder True Fire in the medicinal cauldron made the Essence in his body flow out in a steady stream,\u00a0which kept the purple flames aliveThis was the disadvantage of not having Spiritual Sense. If Xiao Chen could cultivate his Purple Thunder Divine Incantation to the 2nd layer and attain Spiritual Sense, he could directly use it to control the strength of the Purple Thunder True Fire. He would not have to wastefully spend his Essence as he did at present.Within the Azure Dragon medicinal cauldron, the four medicinal liquids of different colors continuously churned before slowly fusing together, turning into a viscous liquid that was continuously spinning. At this moment, the smell of medicine started to turn denser in the room.Xiao Chen, who was without Spiritual Sense, was not able to see the situation inside the medicinal caldron. He could only judge based on the fragrance that came out from the medicinal cauldron that the four types of medicinal liquid had already fused together.At this moment, he could no longer use a fierce flame to purify it. He had to follow the direction of the spinning ball of medicinal liquid, controlling the Purple Thunder True Fire to wrap around it from a distance. The Purple Thunder True Fire also had to slowly rotate in sync with it, and the temperature had to be adjusted.Sweat continuously trickled down from Xiao Chen\u2019s forehead, as this was a delicate step that exhausted more Essence than simply brute-forcing a fierce flame to purify the medicinal liquid. Each time the flames made a complete revolution, Xiao Chen felt the reserve of Essence in his body wither significantly. If he ran into a situation where he ran out of Essence, then everything he had done so far would be for naught.The medicinal fragrance within the house took on another change. Xiao Chen could finally breathe easy. There was about a tenth of his Essence left in his body. The situation that he was the most worried about, running out of Essence, did not occur, fortunately. This bit of Essence was enough to complete the final step in refining this pill.Under the purification of the warm flames, the medicinal liquid in the cauldron had already condensed into a rough sphere-shaped pill embryo. A faint fragrance wafted out from the cauldron. As long as the final step of solidifying it was completed, then this Fasting Pill would be completed.Xiao Chen opened up the cauldron lip, in which an even thicker fragrance wafted out and assaulted his nose. Looking at the rough pill embryo in the medicinal cauldron, Xiao Chen felt extremely content. For him to be able to make it all the way to this step without committing any major mistakes during his first refinement was very gratifying.If he could perfectly complete the final step, then it would be ideal. Xiao Chen\u2019s eyes seemed to burn with excitement, but his heart remained extremely calm. This final step was the most important step. There was no room for mistakes.Xiao Chen guided the Purple Thunder True Fire to slowly rise into the air, and the rough pill embryo similarly followed the purple fire and rose up into the air. He stretched out his right hand and the pill embryo surrounded by purple fire slowly descended onto his palm.It was time to solidify it and shape it!With his attention fully honed in on it, Xiao Chen\u2019s eyebrows were tightly knit into a frown. This would only happen in a situation where someone was concentrating extremely hard.\u201cHu Chi!\u201dThe pill embryo spun rapidly within the flames, and Xiao Chen did not even dare to let go of his breath. The sweat glistened on his forehead as it incessantly poured down his face, trickling downwards. The uneven pill embryo started to smoothen out and turn into a perfect sphere, and even a faint glow began to surround the pill.Only once this step was completed could the Fasting Pill be considered a true pill. Xiao Chen pushed down ferociously with his hand, sending the pill back into the cauldron. After closing the lid, he began the final heating.At this moment, Xiao Chen still did not dare to relent in his focus. Until the pill came out of the cauldron, he had not succeeded. However, there was not much risk anymore. Before this Fasting Pill could be considered complete, it simply needed another half a day to simmer.\u201cSecond Young Master, supper is already ready, do you want to eat yet?\u201d\u201cBang!\u201dRight at this moment, the sudden appearance of Bao`er\u2019s voice caused Xiao Chen to lose focus. In the instant he lost focus, he did not control the flames in the medicinal cauldron properly. Thus, the medicinal pill that was almost completed shattered into pieces.From the other dragon head of the Azure Dragon medicinal cauldron, a stream of debris from the medicinal pill began to flow out...\u201cDamn! What are you doing here at this moment!\u201d Xiao Chen shouted angrily in the direction of the door, at Bao`er.All his efforts were squandered just like that. It was not easy for the refining process to proceed all the way to this final moment. Xiao Chen\u2019s mood was soured to an extreme. His sweat-filled face coupled with his livid expression made him look very terrifying.When Bao`er, who was outside, saw Xiao Chen angrily shouting at her, and then seeing the situation on the table, she knew that she was in trouble. Her tiny face had turned extremely pale from fright, and the tray of supper trembled in her hands as she held onto it.Tears began to trickle down from her eyes as she replied like a little mouse scared witless: \u201cSecond Young Master, I\u2026... I did not do that on purpose\u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Chen, who had exhausted all of his Essence and had entered an extremely weak state of mind, merely waved his hands impatiently, \u201cGo out, there is nothing for you to do here.\u201d\u2026...After half a day, Xiao Chen recovered some of his strength. He then felt regret.\u00a0What\u2019s wrong with me... it was just a failure at refining a pill.\u00a0Why did he lose his temper at a little girl? Had he really begun to fancy himself as a Young Master?With this little bit of strength and status, he had already started losing his temper in such a manner. In that case, how was he different from the Zhang Clan and their prodigal sons? It was just a failed attempt at the refinement of a medicinal pill. If he failed the first time, he could just attempt it again. He had no need to vent his anger on a little girl.The more Xiao Chen thought about it, the more he felt that he was in the wrong. He got up and headed towards Bao`er\u2019s room. The light in her room was not out yet. Xiao Chen, as he stood in front of the door, could hear the gentle sobbings coming from inside.\u201cCreak!\u201dHe gently pushed the door open. Maybe because she came back in a hurry, but the door to her room was not locked and was opened with just a gentle push.When Bao`er, who was sitting at the bedside, saw Xiao Chen push open the door and enter, she hurriedly wiped away the tears in her eyes and shivered as she inquired carefully, \u201cSecond Young Master\u2026\u2026 why are you here? Just now... I really did not do it on purpose...\u201dOh, Xiao Chen, Xiao Chen, such an innocent young lady and you scared her to such a degree. You really are horrible.\u00a0Xiao Chen scolded himself in his heart.He was not able to speak the words of apology he had thought of earlier on the way here. After he saw the supper that was placed on the table, a bowl of squid porridge, he replied, \u201cI am here for supper, as well as to check up on you.\u201dWhen Xiao Chen finished saying that, he picked up the squid porridge on the table and began to eat with gusto. It tasted pretty good. Normally, the kitchens would not provide supper, so this should have been made by Bao`er personally.\u201cIt is very tasty... did you make it yourself?\u201d\u201cEn, I can cook pretty well. I have learned from my mother when I was young.\u201d Bao`er said in a soft voice.Looking at Xiao Chen, who seemed happier after eating the porridge, Bao`er asked tentatively, \u201cSecond Young Master, are you still angry at me?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dXiao Chen slammed down the bowl on the table. His face seemed extremely stern. Bao`er\u2019s heart started to thump very hard in response.\u201cJust kidding with you. I am angry that you made too little squid porridge today. I\u2019m punishing you by making you make more tomorrow.\u201d Xiao Chen suddenly softened his expression into a smile.Bao`er\u2019s tear-stained face immediately lit up with a smile as she said in disbelief: \u201cReally?\u201dXiao Chen got up and walked over to Bao`er, wiping away the tears on her face. He replied in a sincere tone, \u201cReally, the squid porridge tastes very good. I should not have lost my temper at you earlier. Don\u2019t think too much of it and have a good sleep.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were looking at a corpse that was lying on the ground. If Xiao Chen was here, he would definitely be shocked. The corpse lying on the ground could be identified as the Zhang Clan First Elder who had died in the Thunder Emperor\u2019s cave.These two men were the most influential and part of the highest echelon in the Xiao Clan. One of them was the Xiao Clan First Elder, Xiao Qiang. The other was the reclusive Xiao Clan clan head, Xiao Xiong.Xiao Xiong knelt down and casually flipped the corpse over, \u201cWhen was he discovered?\u201dThe corpse had already been rotting for a period of time, as proven by the faint stench of a corpse in the air. Xiao Qiang wrinkled his nose, \u201cTen days ago. When the guards were out on patrol, they found him. You\u2019ve been in secluded training all this time, which is what made it inconvenient to bring the body over to you.\u201dAfter pausing for a while, Xiao Qiang continued, \u201cThis fellow died of the Poinsettia\u2019s poison. I\u2019ve asked Yulan about this and have confirmed her involvement. She has also told me about what happened.\u201dXiao Xiong got up and carefully listened to Xiao Qiang\u2019s depiction of recent events. When he heard about that mysterious Martial Saint in blue, his expression had a slight change, but it recovered almost immediately. After listening to the whole thing, there seemed to be a teasing expression on his face, \u201cThis old fellow was always so hung up on going against us, but this time, he died at the hands of a junior in the Martial Master realm. I wonder how he felt about that?\u201dXiao Qiang laughed with second-hand embarrassment. He did not continue Xiao Xiong\u2019s topic but instead asked with concern in his voice, \u201cAre you not worried at all about that mysterious Martial Saint coming to Mohe City?\u201dXiao Xiong\u2019s expression changed greatly as he revealed a bitter smile, \u201cEver since the Xiao Clan established itself in this tiny Mohe City, those fallen supreme clans did not manage to survive a day past that. Those elders of the Xiao Clan believed that we have benefitted, so what is the point of me worrying?\u201d\u201cIf these dancing clowns want to target my Xiao Clan, as long as I, Xiao Xiong, still have a breath in me, even if I turn into ash, I will take my revenge.\u201d With the change in topic, Xiao Xiong\u2019s eyes had a resolute gleam that could easily inspire a sense of conviction in people.Xiao Qiang naturally understood what Xiao Xiong meant by his words. Ever since he became the First Elder, he knew how strong the enemies of the Xiao Clan had been back then. It had not been easy for the Xiao Clan to survive till today. At the end of the day, their enemies now compared to then were not even worth mentioning in the same breath.\u201cFrom Yulan\u2019s description, the Martial Spirit of the person in blue should be a rock. Within Qizi County, there is only one Martial Saint with this Martial Spirit. The Third Elder of Qinghe City\u2019s Leng Clan.The Leng Clan, they were fully deserving of their title as the number one clan in all of Qizi County. With the backing of the Misty Sword Sect, they had expanded very rapidly in the past few years, and their influence had reached all the way to Heishui City, a city very close to Mohe City. It made sense if they allied with the Zhang Clan to deal with the Xiao Clan.Xiao Xiong did not seem interested in these news; without changing his facial expression, he spoke with mild bemusement: \u201cAll they want is our Xiao Clan\u2019s Seven Horn Mountain. The Promise of Ten Years was established by the City Lord of Mohe City, so even if the Leng Clan had the Misty Sword Sect backing them, they would not dare to make any careless moves. How is the thing that I asked you to investigate in the day?\u201d\u201cThe Martial Spirit of the Second Young Master is indeed an extremely strange purple fire that is relatively tyrannical.\u201d Although Xiao Qiang had his suspicions regarding Xiao Xiong\u2019s overt concern about Xiao Chen\u2019s Martial Spirit, he still spoke truthfully about what he knew.Xiao Xiong revealed a trace of a relaxed expression, \u201cThen has he agreed to participate in the Promise of Ten Years?\u201dSeeing Xiao Xiong ask this question, Xiao Qiang\u2019s usually stern face revealed a trace of a relaxed smile, \u201cHe agreed. This fellow is very crafty. He actually managed to rip off a Spirit Weapon from me.\u201d\u2026\u2026At this moment, Xiao Chen, who was still in Bao`er\u2019s room, naturally did not know that the two greatest authorities in the Xiao Clan were talking about him.After he took his leave from Bao`er\u2019s room, Xiao Chen put his emotions in check and began to proceed with the second attempt at refining the Fasting Pill. After the experience from the first time, Xiao Chen was able to refine this smoothly and easily.Hu!Without any mishaps, after two hours, the Fasting Pill successfully formed its shape and solidified. In one breath, Xiao Chen had placed the pill back in the Azure Dragon medicinal cauldron. After simmering for ten minutes, Xiao Chen extinguished the Purple Thunder True Fire.Ka!There was a flash of brilliance as a glowing pill came out from the other dragon head with a \u2018plop\u2019, falling into the bottle that Xiao Chen had prepared earlier.Wiping away the sweat dotting his forehead, Xiao Chen revealed a smile laced with a trace of contentment. This Fasting Pill was finally a success. However, this was only just the beginning. The Fasting Pill may be mystical, but it had no practical uses for cultivating. He only made it to familiarize himself with the art of refining medicines.Next, he intended to refine the Essence Nurturing Pill and Qi Returning Pill. These were the pills that he wanted to have.As for the Qi Returning Pill, after consuming it, the Spiritual Energy one has exhausted will begin to rapidly recover. Its effects were similar to the Essence Returning Pill of the Tianwu Continent. If a situation arises where a cultivator has exhausted all of his Essence or have had a great expenditure in Essence, the perk in having a pill to recover Essence, regardless of it being in battle or refining medicines, would yield tremendous help in such\u00a0clutch\u00a0situations.As for the Essence Nurturing Pill, it was of even greater use. It could increase the cultivation speed of a low realm cultivator. This was something that Xiao Chen needed in order to quickly cultivate to the 2nd layer of the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation. Similar pills in the Tianwu Continent would require at least a grade five alchemist to refine.If Xiao Chen did not have the Compendium of Cultivation, and the fact that the recipe and alchemy methods were different from this world, let alone with his current cultivation realm, he would have no way to refine a pill like this.However, Xiao Chen was not in a rush to make these two pills. Instead, he continued to refine the Fasting Pill. In the Compendium of Cultivation, these two pills were of similar grades to the Fasting Pill, but the difficulty in refining them was much greater. If he attempted to refine one of them without careful consideration, his chance of failure would be enormous. Furthermore, Xiao Chen was only able to get Bao`er to purchase one set of ingredients for these two pills, as he did not have enough money.Yes, he indeed did not have enough money. Every month, Xiao Chen would receive an allowance of a thousand silver taels from the Xiao Clan. This was sufficient to purchase plenty of materials for the Fasting Pills. However, it would be hard to purchase large amounts of materials for the Qi Returning Pill and Essence Nurturing Pill. If he factored in the rate of failure, then the amount of money needed would essentially be multiplied.With regards to his lack of money, Xiao Chen had already thought of a solution and therefore did not feel too worried about it. His gaze was currently fixed on the Fasting Pill within that jade bottle. The most important thing now was improving his familiarity with alchemy.Taking out the ingredients as outlined in the recipe for the Fasting Pill, Xiao Chen began to tirelessly refine one after the other. Time flew by without him realizing it; and only when his mind was completely exhausted did he cease refining the pills.Glancing towards the jade bottle filled with Fasting Pills, Xiao Chen revealed a contented smile. This bottle had twenty Fasting Pills in it. With all the continuous practice, he had grown more and more familiar with the intricacies of alchemy. He had only failed once as a result of a mistake.Sitting down cross-legged, he observed his Dantian and circulated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation. Xiao Chen began to slowly recover the exhausted Essence.\u00a0Threads of Essence in the room now saturated with a medicinal fragrance slowly entered his body before finally merging with the three white clouds beside the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit.While in cultivation, Xiao Chen lost all concept of time. And when he opened his eyes once again, the sky was bright already. He stretched his body, causing his stiff joints to pop into place with a cracking sound. His body felt incomparably relaxed as, in fact, the exhaustion from the previous night had completely vanished.\u201cYoung Master, can I come in? I have brought water for you to wash up with.\u201d Bao`er\u2019s voice called out from outside the door.Xiao Chen hurriedly got up to open the door. Seeing Bao`er\u2019s face filled with a smile, Xiao Chen felt relieved. It seems that Bao`er had already forgiven him for last night\u2019s matter.\u201cAi! Young Master, your room is very fragrant.\u201dAs he had refined a large batch of Fasting Pills the previous night, the dense medicinal fragrance had not completely dissipated yet. The invigorating fragrance wafted over Bao\u2019er, placating her nerves and improving her mood with a single whiff.As for the fact that he was able to refine medicines, Bao`er already knew about it last night. It was now impossible to hide it from her, so he might as well just spill the beans, \u201cI was refining medicines last night. That\u2019s why the room is very fragrant. I temporarily do not want to let others know that I can refine medicines, so can Bao`er help me keep this secret?\u201dAlthough refining medicine was not a big deal, letting people know about it would undoubtedly attract a lot of trouble. He could at present only hoped that Bao\u2019er was trustworthy enough to keep his secret. After all, towards this fourteen-year-old or fifteen-year-old girl, he did not have the heart to do something such as permanently silencing her.Bao`er nodded her head very seriously, \u201cSecond Young Master, don\u2019t worry, Bao`er will not tell anyone else. Young Master probably has not washed your face yet, let Bao`er help you with it.\u201dAfter Bao`er had laid down her solemn promise, she picked up a wet cloth very naturally and brought it up to Xiao Chen\u2019s face. Having the advantage in how cultivation promoted early growth spurts, Xiao Chen towered over Bao\u2019er and made it difficult for her to reach him. Even after Bao`er stretched her hand out, she had to tip-toe.Seeing Bao`er struggle amused Xiao Chen. He stretched his hand out and grabbed her hand and took the cloth from her, \u201cThis Young Master still has hands and feet. This much I can do myself, so you don\u2019t have to do this in the future.\u201dAfter her hands were grabbed, Bao`er\u2019s face went red as she asked in a soft voice, \u201cThen what else can Bao`er do?\u201dSeeing the lovable Bao`er mutter in a soft voice, Xiao Chen felt a ripple in his heart... an impulse to \u2018attack\u2019 her filled his veins with a throb.Xiao Chen shook his head vigorously before regaining his wits. He noticed the messy bed, \u201cHelp me tidy the bed up, and then later come and clean the room up, and that will be it.\u201dBao`er answered with an \u2018En\u2019 and proceeded to joyfully run over. As long as she had something to do, she would be happy.After washing his face, Xiao Chen held and observed the jade bottle filled with the Fasting Pills, \u201cI will be going into the city later. When you are done with all these, you can spend some time doing whatever you want. There is no need to stay here.\u201d\u201cOk!\u201d Bao`er answered somewhat helplessly. Earlier, she was afraid that Xiao Chen would want her to do something shameless, but now she knew that Xiao Chen was not that kind of person. Gradually, a feeling of having nothing to do began to overcome her.Leaving the Xiao Residence, Xiao Chen found an isolated area and wore a loose black cloak, covering up his entire body before heading towards Mohe City in a hurry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, the most profitable place was the auction hall, but the three great clans had never ventured into this market.This is because of the existing auction hall\u2014Linlang Pavilion.Linlang Pavilion was the largest auction hall within the Great Qin Nation. There were branches in all of the 36 counties in the nine prefectures, and their backer was none other than the emperor's son-in-law, Nangong Lie. Being the relative of the emperor, as well as having the tremendous influence of the Nangong Clan behind him, naturally no one would dare to offend him when he had such a background.Maybe in some of the larger prefecture cities or the imperial capital there might be some powers that were able to go against the Nangong Clan and be daring enough to open auction houses. However, in this insignificant Mohe City, no one would dare to slight them by opening a second auction house.Linlang Pavilion was Xiao Chen\u2019s current destination. If he wanted to earn some quick wads of cash without exposing his identity as an alchemist to the Xiao Clan or selling the Moonstones in his room, he could only rely on the Fasting Pills he had refined in his room the previous night.After he adjusted the cloak on his body, and saw the lavish signboard of Linlang Pavilion, a smile played at Xiao Chen\u2019s lips under the shadow of his cowl as he slowly walked into Linlang Pavilion.Due to the fact that there were fewer people here, Mohe City\u2019s Linlang Pavilion would only hold a small-scale auction once every month, a medium-scale auction every three months, and a large-scale auction once a year. When the time came for the large-scale auction, Mohe City would enter its most busy, bustling state.Looking at the calendar, it was almost the end of the month. There were a lot of people looking at the goods in the great hall of the first floor. Undoubtedly, these people were not of high status in Mohe City. Amongst them, there were many from the three great clans. Xiao Chen noticed many familiar people from the Xiao Clan, but this was not the time to fraternize with kin.Xiao Chen suddenly sensed danger incoming from behind him, and a palm strike struck out towards him shortly after. Reacting quickly and stepping forward, Xiao Chen turned around almost instantly and made his move.\u201cPu Chi!\u201dWith a deft hand, he grabbed the wrist of some unfamiliar stranger. Xiao Chen applied some force to his wrist, causing the individual to wince in pain. With a stern expression, the assailant shouted: \u201cYou bastard! Let me go!\u201dThis person was dressed in martial robes with alternating colors of blue and white, seeming to be about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, and his cultivation realm appeared to be in the Medial Grade Martial Disciple. There was a yellow daisy embroidered on his collar. When Xiao Chen saw it, he immediately understood that this person should be a guard of Linlang Pavilion. However, despite this, he did not have any intentions of letting go.He instead increased the strength in his hand and asked coldly: \u201cWhy did you make a move against me?\u201dThe person in question shouted out in pain once again and scolded, \u201cYou Bastard! Let go quickly or forget about walking out of this Linlang Pavilion!\u201dThe sound of these two people attracted a crowd of people, most beholding Xiao Chen with a certain amount of ridicule in their gazes. It was\u00a0obvious\u00a0to these people that his cultivation was only in the Inferior\u00a0Grade\u00a0Martial Disciple realm. Merely an insignificant Inferior Grade Martial Disciple and he dares to come and cause trouble at Linlang Pavilion. How reckless.Very soon, a large group of people wearing similar blue and white robes came running over, each and every one of them with a yellow daisy embroidered on their collar. Under the command of a Martial Master, they surrounded Xiao Chen.The Martial Master among them had thick eyebrows and big eyes, and his body was robust and sturdy. The expression on his face now was incomparably cautious. He did not look angry or irritable. After looking at Xiao Chen, he frowned slightly, looked at the man restrained by Xiao Chen, and asked in a cold voice, \u201cGao Long, what\u2019s going on?\u201dGao Long, who was restrained by Xiao Chen, had an expression of incomparable pain on his face. There were currents of electricity continuously flowing from Xiao Chen\u2019s hand into his body. This caused him to be unable to gather his Essence. When his Essence encountered this electrical current, it would immediately disperse without a trace, resulting in him being unable to release himself from Xiao Chen\u2019s grip.\u201cCaptain! This person is dressed in a suspicious manner. After he entered the great hall, he looked around in a shifty-eyed manner. I was afraid that he had some wicked motives, and wanted to detain him for questioning.\u201d Gao Long\u2019s voice trembled as he spoke.He was a Medial Grade Martial Disciple, yet he got restrained by an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple. Even if he was in the right, he had lost the face of Linlang Pavilion. He would definitely not be able to escape the captain\u2019s punishment. Thinking of the inevitable punishment awaiting him, Gao Long could not help but tremble.The Superior Grade Martial Master that was addressed as captain looked at Xiao Chen\u2019s attire and also felt suspicious in his heart. The people who entered their pavilion were typically either dressed in bright, colorful clothes or in top-notch satin clothes\u2026 just who would dress up as strangely as Xiao Chen did? Covered completely in the subterfuge of a cloak, he had the appearance of someone with secrets to keep.\u201cMy friend, I am Jiang Qi, the commanding officer of the guard on the first floor of Linlang Pavilion. I wonder what business you have here? Are you here to purchase anything?\u201d Although he had already formed his own opinion about Xiao Chen, Jiang Qi still maintained a cautious attitude and made his inquiries with sobriety.\u201cNo.\u201d The cloak completely covered Xiao Chen\u2019s face in shadows, so what he looked like was a mystery.When the restrained Gao Long heard this, his expression turned to one of joy. This man was not here to buy anything, which naturally meant that he must be here to cause trouble. Since that was the case, this fellow would not step out of here alive. He laughed sinisterly in his heart, and the pain from his hand began to feel less intense due to the solace he found in this statement.\u201cThen what is your purpose here? Visiting a friend?\u201d Jiang Qi continued to ask patiently, but a killing intent previously kept under covers came billowing out without restraint. As long as Xiao Chen\u2019s answer was not satisfactory, he would immediately make a move. Anything that was here to cause trouble in Linlang Pavilion only had one outcome\u2014death!Jiang Qi\u2019s Superior Grade Martial Master aura spread out into the surrounding area, his killing intent locking down onto Xiao Chen. The biting cold killing intent even caused the surrounding people to shiver. Their gazes as they looked at Xiao Chen was as though they were looking at a dead man.Everyone around could feel the thick killing intent. Actually, this was a result of an\u00a0insufficient cultivation base. The killing intent of a true expert could form into a string-like network, focusing all of their killing intent only on the target and leaving any irrelevant onlookers in their surroundings untouched.Xiao Chen, who was now surrounded by the killing intent, did not display any fear and simply spoke casually, \u201cI do not have any friends here.\u201dJiang Qi laughed coldly, \u201cForgive me for this offense then.\u201d\u201cHu!\u201dThe surrounding air seemed to turn cold, and a thick, cold Qi gathered around his body. Ice covered his fist as he shouted out loudly and threw a punch at Xiao Chen.Xiao Chen took a step back and spun Gao Long\u2019s body around in the air, ruthlessly throwing him towards Jiang Qi. He then unhurriedly took out the jade bottle containing the Fasting Pills and gently opened the bottle cap. A thick medicinal fragrance immediately spread out and pervaded the surroundings. Very soon, the entire great floor of the first floor was fully saturated in this fragrance.\u201cWhat pill is this\u2014why is it so fragrant?\u201d\u201cCould this fellow be an alchemist?\u201d\u201cI think it is very likely. The behavior of those alchemists are usually very strange. He wouldn\u2019t be this calm if that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201dThe chatter of the crowd quickly filled the entire great hall, every conversation discussing this fragrance. These people were all people of some status and had encountered genuine pills before, but they had never come across a pill with such a rich and thick fragrance. Instantly, they viewed Xiao Chen as a mysterious alchemist of high rank.The corners of Xiao Chen\u2019s mouth curved upwards under the cloak, \u201cIs there no one that wants to do business here in such a big Linlang Pavilion?\u201dJiang Qi, who had just caught Gao Long, casually threw away the young guard to the ground. When he heard Xiao Chen\u2019s words and saw the bottle of pills in Xiao Chen\u2019s hand, he knew that he might have gotten himself into some trouble. He hurriedly cusped his hands, \u201cSenior, pardon me for my poor manners. My humble self is dumb, so please forgive me.\u201dAlthough Xiao Chen\u2019s strength\u00a0was only\u00a0in the Inferior Grade Martial Disciple realm, it would be normal for Jiang Qi to address him as senior if he was capable of refining high grade pills.Gao Long laid on the ground, groaning in pain. Xiao Chen had used a great deal of force when he threw him towards Jiang Qi. Coupled with Jiang Qi casually tossing him away, his whole body was now in pain. After hearing Jiang Qi\u2019s words, Gao Long felt as though his whole body had been drenched in cold water. He was extremely unlucky today... he had actually treated an alchemist like a suspicious criminal and offended him.Xiao Chen did not pay any attention to Jiang Qi\u2019s change in attitude, as all of it was within the scope of his expectations, and he did not find it strange at all. He dismissively replied, \u201cStop speaking rubbish, bring me to see your appraiser. I want to auction off these pills at this coming\u00a0end-of-month\u00a0auction.\u201dJiang Qi cusped his hands in gratitude once again and led Xiao Chen towards the inner areas. As they made their way in, Jiang Qi tried to fish for information about his origins. Of course, Xiao Chen was not fooled and spoke a bunch of half truths to throw him off.Looking at Xiao Chen\u2019s departing figure, the people in the quiet hall quickly turned to noisy discussion again after half a day. The sounds of people discussing rose and fell in succession.\u201cThis alchemist is actually here to auction things away. Old Chen, do you remember when the Linlang pavilion last auctioned medicinal pills?\u201d\u201cDuring the large-scale auction last year, there were some grade three pills.\u201d\u201cI think that this year\u2019s large-scale auction could be held in advance this year. These pills that the mysterious man have brought to the table are definitely superior to grade three pills.\u201d\u201cNonsense, how could grade three pills be so fragrant? I have seen grade four pills before\u2014and they can\u2019t hold a candle to that fragrance earlier\u201d A person beside the man who spoke earlier refuted him immediately.\u201cHow could it be? To refine a grade four pill, one must at least be a rank four alchemist. Within the whole Luojie Prefecture, there are only a handful of rank four alchemists. Why would they come to our insignificant Mohe City?\u201dIn a short moment, within the great hall, there were intense debates about what grade these mysterious pills could possibly be at.\u2026...At this moment, within the inner area, the pill appraiser, Hu Lao, had his forehead filled with sweat as he struggled to assess the grade of Xiao Chen\u2019s pills. Fasting Pill, after consuming one, an individual would not have any need for eat or drink for the duration of an entire month. What kind of inconceivable pill was this? It was totally unheard of in the Great Qin Nation.The appraisers of Linlang pavilion were naturally not bad. They were all nurtured by the Linlang Pavilion itself. They had to go through many examinations before they could be assigned to a pavilion to officially work as an appraiser. Furthermore, the appraisers of Linlang Pavilion would start from the smallest locations first and then slowly move up.Thus, even the appraiser of Mohe City\u2019s Linlang pavilion would be equivalent to any of the other appraisers from the auction houses of the larger prefecture cities.Hu Lao looked carefully at the pill in his hand. He was sure that this pill was not just casually made by just anyone. When it came to its fragrance, its color, or its smoothness, they were all by no means something a regular person could accomplish. However, he was sure that he had never heard of any pill in this world called Fasting Pill. This rendered him having not the foggiest idea on how to evaluate it, which proved to be a massive headache for him as time trickled on.Xiao Chen gently took a sip of the tea placed on the tea table beside him as he observed Hu Lao repeatedly attempting to make sense of the pill. He interjected in an impatient manner: \u201cHu Lao, after inspecting it for so long, can you give me a price already?\u201dHu Lao wiped the sweat off his forehead and decided, in the end, to play it safe. With an apologetic tone, he said: \u201cWould you be willing to please wait for a moment? I am unable to appraise this pill, so allow me to invite the pavilion master over.\u201dXiao Chen placed the tea cup down and made a hand gesture that indicated for him to do as he pleased. He was quite confident in Linlang Pavilion\u2019s ability to appraise this Fasting Pill, after all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, he found that the doors were shut and there were two guards on duty in front of the doors.The doors of the pavilion master\u2019s room were normally open. In the event of the otherwise, it usually meant he was receiving an important guest and that it was inconvenient to interrupt him. However, the current matter at hand was urgent; if news traveled of Linlang Pavilion\u2019s inability to appraise a pill, its reputation would take a big hit.\u201cBrothers, I need to meet the pavilion master, can you please inform him.\u201d Hu Lao said in a heavy tone.The guards outside naturally recognized Hu Lao. However,the pavilion master had strictly instructed them to not let anyone interrupt him. The guards were somewhat put on a spot, \u201cHu Lao, the pavilion master is currently meeting with an important guest. He has instructed us to not let anyone disturb him.\u201dHu Lao felt somewhat disappointed, for it was as he had expected. However, when he thought of Xiao Chen\u2019s impatient demeanor, he was under the impression that Xiao Chen might leave if he kept him waiting. Thus, he urgently added: \u201cI need to find the pavilion master for something very important, would you two please help me out here. I will take responsibility for anything that happens.\u201dThe guards were once again placed in a difficult position. The position of the appraisers in the Linlang pavilion were extremely high, to the point that even the pavilion master displayed excessive decorum in front of them. The positions of these two guards were vastly inferior to Hu Lao\u2019s. If it truly were some major matter, then they might get implicated. However, the pavilion master had indeed instructed them to not let anyone disturb him.Seeing the two men hesitate, Hu Lao hardened his heart and said in a cold voice, \u201cThis matter is extremely important. If this is foiled as a result of this, don\u2019t blame me for not reminding you.\u201dUpon hearing this, the two guards finally chose to compromise and let Hu Lao in, \u201cHu Lao, let us say this first. If the pavilion master blames anyone, you have to shoulder all the responsibility.\u201dHu Lao nodded his head and immediately rushed in.Within the room, the pavilion master appeared to be in an excellent mood. He smiled at the girl dressed in a man\u2019s clothes across from him, \u201cFeixue, you have been here for a few days already, and only now do you remember about uncle Nangong. How could you.\u201dDressed in a man\u2019s attire, the alert Feng Feixue gently smiled, \u201cUncle Yan, have I not come already?\u201dPointing to the tea leaves on the table, she continued speaking, \u201cI know that you like the Jun Mountain Silver Needle Tea. I have purchased half their stock from Wenxuan Teashop in the Imperial Capital just for you.\u201dWhen Nangong Yan heard this, he laughed loudly. It appears that he actually did not mind Feng Feixue coming to visit him a few days late, \u201cI have not seen you for six years already. You have grown up to be so pretty now. You must have the young masters of the imperial capital coiled around your fingers right?\u201dWhen Feng Feixue heard this, she blushed slightly and smiled, \u201cUncle Yan, stop teasing me.\u201dNangong Yan seemed to remember something as he suddenly said, \u201cAh, I almost forgot, you have already been betrothed to someone. How is that lad from the Bai Clan? I\u2019ll check him out for you when I have time. If he is not good, then I will help you cancel this engagement.\u201dFeng Feixue felt warmth surge in her heart. She believed that the old man in front of her would definitely stay true to his words. He definitely had the abilities to do so. Not to mention that this old man had always seen her as though she was his granddaughter.At this moment, the sound of Hu Lao\u2019s footsteps could be heard. Nangong Yan\u2019s expression changed, irritation quickly building on his face. He had already instructed the guards to not let anyone in, so why was there still someone coming to interrupt them?Hu Lao noticed the atmosphere in the room, as well as saw Nangong Yan\u2019s expression, so he knew that Nangong Yan was waiting for him to explain himself. If he did not have a good reason, then he would definitely be in trouble.After all, this pavilion master in front of him had a different status compared to other pavilion masters. He did not have to completely follow the rules.After he paid his respects, Hu Lao spoke in an apologetic tone, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for this interruption, but the matter at hand concerns the reputation of our Linlang Pavilion. Thus, I had no choice but to come and bother you\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter giving Feng Feixue a glance, Hu Lao fell quiet.Nangong Yan understood what he meant and replied, \u201cSpeak, there are no outsiders here.\u201dHu Lao nodded his head and took out the jade bottle filled with Fasting Pills, passing it to Nangong Yan right away, \u201cA mysterious alchemist came today, and he wants to auction this pill. I was unable to appraise the grade.\u201dNangong Yan received the jade bottle, but what he saw shocked him. He was very clear on Hu Lao\u2019s abilities to appraise pills. Regardless of theory or knowledge, there were few superior to him. To think there was actually a pill that he could not appraise.What pill was this?He took out a Fasting Pill and brought it to the front of his eye to inspect it carefully. The fragrance exuded by the pill in front of him entered into Nangong Yan\u2019s nose.\u00a0What a fragrant pill, Nangong Yan praised in his heart.In his sea of consciousness, within a boundless mental world, there was a green sphere that was continuously rotating. There were boundless green ripples emerging in that mental space.A green energy thread that could not be seen with the naked eye shot out from Nangong Yan\u2019s sea of consciousness and made a connection to the Fasting Pill.In an instant, Nangong Yan had used his Spiritual Awareness to enter into the inner area of the pill. There was a mist-like Qi inside it obstructing his view, and the further he went in, the thicker the mist became.Nangong Yan turned pale with fright, as he had never encountered such a situation before. If he did not leave now, he might not be able to come out later.He pulled back his Spiritual Awareness with some lingering fears. Looking at the stripes and the luster of the pill, Nangong Yan\u2019s expression turned grave. He was one of the best at alchemy within the Great Qin Nation. Just by taking a look at\u00a0any pill, he was able to tell the refining method and the skill level of the alchemist.However, this pill in front of him was actually able to stop his Spiritual Awareness from entering the core of the pill. He was sure that the refining method was not the mainstream method of the continent. It could very possibly be a long-lost ancient method of refining pills.Thinking of this, Nangong Yan got very excited. He had been stuck at the peak of a Rank 7 alchemist for many years already. Having lacked the opportunity to increase his rank all along, this could be his chance.Outsiders only knew that the seventh rank of the alchemist vocation was the peak, but he knew that it was definitely far from the peak. He had seen with his own eyes alchemists of even higher ranks.The distance between the two was like that of heaven and earth.\u201cDid that person say what pill this is?\u201d Nangong Yan calmed himself down.Hearing Nangong Yan\u2019s tone, Hu Lao finally relaxed. This pill had indeed aroused the pavilion master\u2019s interest. He nodded his head and explained, \u201cHe called this the \u2018Fasting Pill\u2019. After consuming this pill, there would not be any need to eat or drink anything for a month. I have never heard of this kind of pill before, so I had no idea as to what kind of price I can set.\u201dFasting Pill? Hearing those miraculous effects, Nangong Yan felt shocked, and then he laughed out loud, \u201cI was right, Hu Lao. I will remember your contributions. After this month's auction, I will transfer you to a prefecture city\u2019s Linlang Pavilion branch.\u201dHu Lao felt joyful in his heart and hurriedly cusped his hands in gratitude. To be promoted from Mohe City to a prefecture city was a promotion of three ranks. He was originally under the impression that he would never be able to reach such heights in his lifetime, but who knew that this dream of his would be realized in one go like this.Feng Feixue, who was at the side all the while, did not understand Nangong Yan\u2019s excitement. Although it had miraculous effects, it did not seem especially useful to cultivators. Why would her Uncle Yan view it with such importance?Nangong Yan looked at Feng Feixue and smiled, \u201cGirl, come with me to see this senior. See if we can gain any fortuitous encounters.\u201dThis aligned with Feng Feixue\u2019s intentions, as she felt a little curious about this miraculous pill and the one behind its creation. Thus, she followed Hu Lao downstairs to the inner area of the pavilion.Soon, the three of them had already reached the door of the inner area. Nangong Yan threw a quick look at Xiao Chen, but his immediate response was the bitterness of disappointment. He shook his head dejectedly. With one look, he could tell Xiao Chen\u2019s strength. The strength of his core was unbelievably weak, making it obvious that this was an alchemist who had only awakened his Spiritual Awareness recently.Xiao Chen nervously clutched the black cloak around his body. The pressure released by Nangong Yan was too enormous. With that one look of his, he had seen through the cloak and wholly exposed everything about him under his gaze.Seeing Feng Feixue follow behind, he was shocked. Why was this woman here? Her background was indeed very mysterious.When Feng Feixue saw Xiao Chen completely covered in that black cloak, she felt incredibly shocked. Based on the blood vessels she could see, she could identify this person as Xiao Chen. She had never thought that he truly was an alchemist, not to mention one who was able to shock Nangong Yan.Although her heart was in turmoil, Feng Feixue did not change her expression. Since Xiao Chen had dressed in such a style, then he definitely did not wish to reveal his identity. If she behaved in too shocked a manner, it would cause suspicion on Nangyong Yan\u2019s side.\u201cThis little brother, were you the one who refined this Fasting Pill?\u201d Although Nangong Yan was not able to see his face, he was able to extrapolate his age and immediately bluntly asked this question.Xiao Chen did his best to calm himself. Although Nangong Yan did not intentionally release his own aura, the tiny green sphere in Xiao Chen\u2019s sea of consciousness could not help but keep trembling. This was an instinctive fear stemming from the core when meeting with a high-ranked alchemist whose core exceeded his.Xiao Chen, who was under the cloak, gently released his breath and rapidly flitted through his thoughts. In a short moment, he replied in a deep voice: \u201cNo, this was refined by my master.\u201dIndeed, it was as I expected, Nangong Yan thought in his heart as he went on a happy streak of inquiries, \u201cHow may I address your master? This old man recognizes all of the alchemists within the Great Qin Nation.\u201dThis pill was refined by myself, how could there be a master?\u00a0Xiao Chen laughed coldly in his heart. As of now, his mental state had already recovered. He coldly replied, \u201cIs Linlang Pavilion running a business, or does it investigate the backgrounds of those that step into its space? If you are not interested in making a deal, I\u2019ll be taking my leave.\u201dSpeaking up to that point, Xiao Chen decisively stood up to leave!Nangong Yan was startled. He knew that he was\u00a0too hasty and had been too rude. He hurriedly went up and backtracked as hard as he came on in the beginning, \u201cMy young friend, please don\u2019t go, this old man has been too rude.\u201dXiao Chen stopped and replied with his back facing Nangong Yan: \u201cI can stay, but I will only talk about business.\u201dNangong Yan gave Hu Lao a glance. Hu Lao registered the gesture immediately and swiftly went on over to usher Xiao Chen back into his seat with a smile, \u201cIf you are here to auction this, then there is no place in Mohe City more suitable than Linlang Pavilion!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29:\u00a0Reentering Seven Horn Mountain\u201cThen would you, pavilion master, please set the price!\u201d Xiao Chen looked at Nangong Yan and requested indifferently.Nangong Yan muttered to himself for a while before deciding, \u201cThis Fasting Pill\u2026 Hmmm, Linlang Pavilion will start the auction for this at 10000 silver taels per pill, what do you think?\u201dXiao Chen did some calculation in his head: twenty Fasting Pills would be a starting price of 200000 silver taels. Following the rules of the auction house, he could obtain 30% of the starting price as a kind of deposit, which was 60000 silver taels. That should be enough for his short-term usage.\u201cIn that case, it\u2019s settled. These twenty Fasting Pills will be left here for Linlang Pavilion to auction. Please draft the contract now.\u201dNangong Yan smiled gently, \u201cNo hurry. I want to discuss something with you. Out of the twenty Fasting Pill, I would like to purchase ten for myself. Of course, I will not take advantage of you. For however much this Fasting Pill sells for at the auction, I will add an additional\u00a0two-fold.\u201dThe deal did not result in any loss for Xiao Chen, so it did not matter to whom he sold it, \u201cFor these ten Fasting Pills, you have to give me 30% of the starting price first, as the rules state. As for the other ten pills reserved for you, you have to give me threefold of 30% of the starting price. That will be a total of 130000 silver taels.\u201dNangong Yan nodded his head, \u201cThis is not a problem. According to the normal procedures, Linlang charges a 10% handling fee. I can reduce this to 5% for you. My friend, if you have any more pills you wish to sell, I hope you will continue to patronize our Linlang Pavilion.\u201dThis was quite an attractive offer. Without a large amount of money to spend on materials and ingredients, it would be difficult to improve as an alchemist. It would therefore be a wise move to partner with Linlang Pavilion.After signing the contract and receiving the money, Xiao Chen immediately left Linlang Pavilion.Hu Lao took out ten Fasting Pills and placed them in another jade bottle before passing them to Nangong Yan, \u201cPavilion master, can we directly place this into the catalog?\u201dNangong Yan shook his head, \u201cNot yet, find a person to test its effects on first. In case we made a mistake.\u201dHu Lao was startled in his heart. So even the pavilion master was unable to verify the effects of this pill as well.\u2026\u2026Xiao Chen avoided attracting anyone\u2019s attention by virtue of leaving through the back door of Linlang Pavilion. He searched for an isolated area and immediately changed his get-up. Holding the banknotes, he snickered in a silly manner. This was the first chunk of money that he had earned by himself, so he felt very excited.Going to the herbs shop, he purchased a hundred sets of ingredients for each of both of the pills he intended to refine. After this, he still had quite a lot of money left. Giving it some more thought, he bought some things that girls would like, such as\u00a0make-up\u00a0or head accessories. He purchased these to give to Bao`er and Xiao Yulan.After purchasing everything, he ended up carrying tens of packages of various sizes. It was incredibly inconvenient. But this merely further motivated him to refine a spatial storage treasure. However, in order to do this, he had to cultivate the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation to the second layer first. Only by achieving that would he have met the basic requirement to forge equipment.His only option now was to spend a small sum of money to hire a horse carriage. Xiao Chen threw a banknote with a hefty amount\u00a0ascribed to it\u00a0at the owner of a horse carriage, who immediately scampered off and left behind his horse carriage.\u00a0It feels great to be rich, Xiao Chen sighed in his heart.After placing all of his goods on the horse carriage, Xiao Chen felt much more at ease. The horses drawing the carriages in this world were much more docile than the ones on Earth. Xiao Chen gave driving it a try and gradually figured out the trick behind it.As he drove the carriage out of the city gates, the number of people on the road started to decrease until he could no longer see anyone save for the occasional passing traveler. Xiao Chen, who had earned such a large sum of money for the first time in his life, was at present in a very good mood. He started to sing a nonsensical song that he made up on the spot in a tone-deaf manner.\u201cThe weather today is very sunny, and the scenery is great, great scenery. The butterflies are busy, as are the bees...... the clattering of the horse hoofs\u2026\u2026~\u201d\u201cI am rich, rich,\u00a0there is a Nokia in my left hand and a Motorola in my right\u2026\u2026\u201dMost of the things he sang were nonsensical, as he could not remember the lyrics to any song whatsoever. Ever since he had come to this world, this was the first time he had felt this relaxed. As there were no one on the road, no one would hear his tone-deaf singing, thus he sang happily and without restraint.\u201cHa ha\u2026\u2026\u201dSuddenly, from the roof of the horse carriage, a bell-like laughter emerged. It was like the tinkling of a wind chime as it moved in the wind.\u201cWho is it!\u201dXiao Chen hurriedly stopped singing and shouted sternly. He was too careless\u2014for how long had this individual been following him? He couldn\u2019t actually sense them.Drawing the Lunar Shadow he had placed on his back, he put down the horse reins and leaped up gently, somersaulting as he hacked towards the direction of the sound.Feng Feixue, who was on the roof, gently laughed as she avoided Xiao Chen\u2019s saber with incredibly soft movements. She somersaulted twice in the air before gracefully landing on the ground.\u201cWho knew that Young Master Xiao was so talented. Aside from being able to refine medicine, he is able to sing as well.\u201dWhen Xiao Chen on the roof saw the smooth and fair Feng Feixue dressed in men\u2019s clothing, he felt incredibly embarrassed. It was similar to that feeling he had once experienced when he inadvertently began singing aloud in an internet cafe while wearing headphones.Sheathing back Lunar Shadow, Xiao Chen smiled, \u201cI did not expect it to be Miss Feng. I did not expect such a fairy-like person to be following me, doing these kinds of sneaky things. Feng Feixue, you have disappointed me.\u201d After saying this, he even acted as though it was a serious manner and shook his head.Feng Feixue smiled gently, \u201cI did not follow you sneakily. I have been on the roof of your horse carriage even before you left the city gates. To think that not only are you not grateful to the person who sold you your medicinal cauldron, you even pulled out your saber to try and injure me. Young Master Xiao, I\u2019m so disappointed in you too.\u201d After she said that, she imitated Xiao Chen and shook her head.This time, when he met with Feng Feixue, Xiao Chen did not feel that uneasy feeling he had when he was in Regretful Iron the last time. Furthermore, he could not feel any evil intentions coming from Feng Feixue, thus he was quite relaxed.Seeing the way Feng Feixue shook her head, Xiao Chen could not help but laugh. He jumped down from the top of the horse carriage and took out a hairpin from among his stash and tossed it at Feng Feixue before he rode onwards without pausing.\u201cMiss Feng, regardless of your intentions in following me, I am going home now. Consider this hairpin as a thank-you gift for selling me the medicinal cauldron.\u201dFeng Feixue grabbed the hairpin out of the air and looked at the horse carriage galloping off into the distance. She shook her head, \u201cIdiot! Since when have you seen me use a hairpin?\u201dIndeed, the Feng Feixue who frequently dressed up as a male did not have much use for a hairpin that is normally used by a girl. Perhaps this was done intentionally by Xiao Chen, or perhaps it was unintentional. However, he had already made it quite far into the distance, so it was too late to question him about it. Feng Feixue shook her head and eventually turned around to return .By the time Xiao Chen made it back to the Xiao Residence, it was already noon. His trip this time had taken the entire morning. When he drove the horse carriage to his tiny courtyard, Xiao Chen saw Bao`er tidying up the mess he had created in the front yard.Jumping off the horse carriage and looking at Bao`er\u2019s frail body, Xiao Chen felt a sense of pity. He called Bao`er over with his hands, \u201cPut what you are doing aside for now and help me move these things.\u201dBao`er immediately stopped what she was doing and ran over to him. Although Xiao Chen had told her to help him, he still had to carry the larger packages himself. As they were moving the things, Bao`er looked strangely at a large pile of accessories in the horse carriage. She picked up these things and carried them to Xiao Chen\u2019s room, feeling very puzzled.Seeing the things in Bao`er\u2019s hands, Xiao Chen smiled, \u201cI brought these for you, pick out a few for yourself, but just be sure to leave me some, as I still have to give a few to some friends.\u201dBao`er felt warmth spread in her heart. She had not expected that these things were bought for her. She was just a maid, so why did the Young Master buy things for her? Could it be...Thinking of those shameless things, Bao`er blushed again. She lowered her head and simply picked out a few clothes and head accessories, quickly running away shortly after. Xiao Chen was puzzled at this. Were the things that he had bought inadequate? Would girls not enjoy them? After all, this was the first time he had ever purchased anything for a girl.In the following days, Xiao Chen began anxiously refining the Essence Nurturing Pill and Qi Returning Pill. He would refine pills until he exhausted all of his Essence and became too mentally exhausted before resting. On the first day of refining, he had a ridiculously poor success rate; out of ten refinements, he would only succeed in three. After he became more familiar with the process, his success rate began to gradually increase.However, regardless of how hard he tried, this success rate never came close to his refinement rate for the Fasting Pill. Xiao Chen knew that this had something to do with his abilities as an alchemist. When his abilities were insufficient, it was normal for him to have a high failure rate for pills with higher difficulty. He could not rush it and could only slowly accumulate experience to raise his ability\u00a0as an alchemist.After a week, Xiao Chen had completely used up all of the medicinal ingredients he had purchased. He managed to refine fifty Essence Nurturing Pills and seventy Qi Returning Pills in this time frame. Evidently, he had experienced higher returns with the Qi Returning Pill. In this week of non-stop refining, he grew more adept at controlling the Purple Thunder True Fire. His cultivation of the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation had reached the peak of the first layer as a bonus.What gave Xiao Chen the most joy was that the green sphere in his sea of consciousness could now penetrate into the medicinal cauldron and allow him to see clearly the state of the flames and the medicinal liquid in the cauldron. It was a pity that he could not control this phenomenon. Sometimes it happened, sometimes it did not. If it could be controlled, then his success rate pertaining to pill refining would increase dramatically.At this moment, there were only about four more months to the Promise of Ten Years. The urgency in Xiao Chen\u2019s heart increased as the days went by. It was about time for him to enter Seven Horn Mountain for more bitter training.Early in the morning, Xiao Chen packed the bottles of Qi Returning Pills and Essence Nurturing Pills, equipped Lunar Shadow on his back, and made some other simple preparations before he prepared to leave. He also brought along the Fasting Pills that he had refined for the sake of this cultivating session.\u201cYoung Master, I have brought the washing water, can I come in?\u201dBao`er\u2019s voice came in from outside the door once again. Xiao Chen revealed a smile on his face. He had not stepped out of his room for the past week. Everything that he ate and drank were specially prepared and brought to him by Bao`er, creating an ideal environment for alchemy. This made him feel quite grateful to her.After he opened the doors, Xiao Chen received the wash basin. After washing his face, he told Bao`er, who was tidying his bed up, \u201cI am going to start my secluded, bitter training from tomorrow on. Remember to stay here and look after my courtyard.\u201dBitter training. That meant he would be leaving for a long time. Bao`er felt a sense of loss as she wordlessly answered Xiao Chen, continuing to tidy the bed up.Xiao Chen stepped out of the doors. Before he left, he looked at Bao`er\u2019s figure and smiled warmly before leaving. The morning sunlight shone down on the youth\u2019s face. The light felt really warm, filling him with fighting spirit.The next time he came back, not only would his Purple Thunder Divine Incantation be in the second layer, his own cultivation realm would be Medial Grade Martial Disciple. Xiao Chen made this solemn oath in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xiao Chen followed the crowd and slowly made his way up the mountain, but he did not have to pay the entry fee to enter the mountain unlike the crowd around him. The guards at the pass recognized him and solemnly kept their silence. The situation had changed, and now that Xiao Chen was no longer recognized as the trash of old, naturally, no one would mock him anymore or even dare to.After traveling for half a day and making it through the pass, the sight of the vast mountain range of Seven Horn Mountain opened up to his view, scenic and breathtaking. The cultivators who came to Seven Horn Mountain typically came for the sake of picking medicinal herbs or hunting Spirit Beasts. Everyone had their own agenda, thus the crowd quickly dispersed as they went to do their own thing.Continuing to travel forward, there was no longer anyone traveling on the same path as Xiao Chen. Recalling the route he had taken in the past, Xiao Chen quickly found the place that was saturated with Spiritual Energy.Compared to the previous time he had been here, Xiao Chen\u2019s senses were much stronger now. Before he drew near to the area, he could already feel that it had been occupied by a Spirit Beast.Xiao Chen felt slightly disappointed in his heart, as he originally thought that he could meet Cousin Yulan. That way he would be able to avoid a battle.\u201cBang! Bang!\u201dA two meter tall Spirit Beast resembling a black bear trotted out heavily and slowly appeared in front of Xiao Chen\u2019s eyes. Its red eyes were glaring at him, and in the very next moment it rushed at him while roaring furiously.Bloodmoon Demonic Bear. It had the strength of a rank\u00a02\u00a0Spirit Beast, which was equivalent to a human Superior Grade Martial Disciple. This was the new tyrant of the area!It was obvious from its actions that it recognized Xiao Chen as someone not to be trifled with and only wanted to scare him away. If it could drive him away, it could therefore avoid engaging in a risky battle.It was a pity that Xiao Chen needed this area. It seemed that things would not go the way the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear wanted.\u201cChi!\u201dDrawing Lunar Shadow, the energy in the Spirit Weapon rapidly connected with the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit inside Xiao Chen. He moved as fast as lightning and pushed himself off the ground, rushing towards the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear. The Purple Thunder Divine Incantation quickly circulated as arcs of electricity jumped around on the saber, and the mist in the forest acted like a conductor for electricity, buzzing continuously.In the vicinity around Xiao Chen, electrical flashes were being emitted incessantly in a wide radius. The flashes nearly made him look like a tesla coil, which in turn also made him look incomparably mighty and powerful.The Bloodmoon Demonic Bear, which had been capable of occupying this area all things considered, naturally did not shy away from a fight. It roared explosively as its blood-red pupils gave off a bloodthirsty gleam. It stomped ferociously at the ground, leaping rapidly towards Xiao Chen. Its huge body was actually able to move at such a speed.\u201cBang! Cha!\u201dAs they both flew towards each other, they clashed violently with each other in midair. The violent collision created a fierce shockwave. After the surrounding trees in the forest were hit by the shockwaves, they were shaken violently, causing their leaves to fall and scatter everywhere like snow in winter.The front limbs of the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear firmly grasped onto Xiao Chen\u2019s Lunar Shadow. Relying on the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit in his body, Xiao Chen was able to break even with the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear that was equivalent to a Superior Grade Martial Disciple.It was a pity to him as the Lunar Shadow Saber would be able to display more of the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit\u2019s strength if it were of a higher grade. The power of that strike would definitely be able to behead this Spirit Beast easily.However, against the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear which could only use brute force, Xiao Chen still had the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation. In the time to took for a spark to fly off a flint, the electrical energy on Lunar Shadow traveled via the front limbs of the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear and invaded its body. The Bloodmoon Demonic Bear convulsed and fell down with a loud crash shortly after.Xiao Chen quickly slashed three times in the air. With the power of the Azure Dragon, instead of falling to the ground, he rose even higher. He then somersaulted in midair and landed gently on a thick tree branch.He sheathed the saber and focused his attention on the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear currently continuously convulsing on the ground. With just a thought, one of the clouds beside the Azure Dragon became significantly thinner as a huge amount of Essence flowed to Xiao Chen\u2019s left hand.With a flick of his finger, he sent a stream of purple flames towards the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear like an arrow-shaped flaming projectile. This move alone had exhausted a large amount of Xiao Chen\u2019s Essence in an instant. It streaked through the air and struck the body of the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear.\u201cPu!\u201dA deep red glow appeared on the body of the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear. After a while, the entire body of the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear was lit on fire, turning it into a purple flaming bear. Within the fire, the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear roared painfully.When Xiao Chen saw this scene from his vantage atop the tree branch, he actually shook his head in dissatisfaction. Although the Purple Thunder True Fire was tyrannical, when it encountered a cultivator or Spirit Beast of a higher grade and they had some resistances against it, it would be very difficult to break through the protective screen of Essence to injure their body.Once the Purple Thunder True Fire exhausted all the energy supplied to it, it would naturally be extinguished. After that, it would no longer be a threat to anyone.Just as it was now. Although the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear looked like it was in a terrible situation, it actually did not suffer any major damage. What was being burnt was actually the Essence on the surface of its body. It was not actually hurting its body. Or else it would have already turned into a pile of ashes.However, it was an unpleasant situation for the bear at the moment. Not only did it have to exhaust a large amount of Essence to suppress the strange purple fire, the temperature of the fire was also unbearable.The purple flames burned for a whole minute before being extinguished. At this moment, the fur of the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear was entirely burnt black. There was black smoke coming out from its nose and mouth, and it now seemed like a piece of black charcoal, which made it look less intimidating than it did before.Xiao Chen, who was waiting for the right moment, leaped down from the tree, brandishing his saber to chop down at it. The Bloodmoon Demonic Bear roared angrily and smashed its paw towards Xiao Chen. There was a huge\u00a0recoiling force coming from the\u00a0blade of the saber. Xiao Chen took a gentle step back, avoiding being directly hit by that forceful blow in their brief exchange.The Bloodmoon Demonic Bear seemed to be in a frenzy as it sent paw smashes after paw smashes at him. The amount of force behind each paw smash seemed to have increased by half as opposed to earlier. Xiao Chen clearly understood that the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear would not be able to maintain such a state for long. Once this streak of attacks made in reckless abandon ended, he would be able to slaughter it like cattle at his whim.Xiao Chen brandished his sword and continued to parry each incursion, not clashing head-on with it. After a while, the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear started to show traces of fatigue. Xiao Chen had a strange smile on his face as he made the same hand motions as he did before when condensing the Purple Thunder True Fire, as though he was going to shoot it out again.The Bloodmoon Demonic Bear seemed to have an aghast expression. It stood firmly on the ground with its four limbs and retreated a few steps. A protective screen of deep red Essence completely covered the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear without leaving any gaps.Looks like this beast was truly afraid of the Purple Thunder True Fire. Xiao Chen flung his empty hand around, smiling in his heart,\u00a0this deep red Essence shield should be the defensive technique that the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear used earlier.Seeing Xiao Chen\u2019s mocking gaze, the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear was now thoroughly infuriated. Its eyes began to change to a demonic appearance as it stomped the ground repeatedly in ire unmatched, producing a lot of loud, angry noises.Paper tiger, Xiao Chen looked at it with disdain,\u00a0You are not worth playing with anymore.Die! Divine Thunder Break!As Xiao Chen shouted, his body gave off a resplendent electrical light. Superior Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique\u2014Thunder Break. Lightning tore through the air, and like a sharp arrow piercing through a wooden board, the red protective screen of the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear now had a massive hole.Purple Thunder True Fire! Shoot!The white cloud beside the Azure Dragon in his body turned transparent, indicating that he had used up one of the three clouds, which also meant Xiao Chen had exhausted one-third of his Essence.The strange and tyrannical purple flame went through the hole in an instant, drilling a black hole into the body of the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear. This was the scene of the purple fire burning its body. The black hole quickly grew larger, eventually consuming its entire body,The Bloodmoon Demonic Bear continuously let out loud cries of misery. It ran around non-stop in an attempt to put out the flame. However, regardless of what it did, it was to no avail.After a while, only a complete set of bones comprising its skeletal frame and a pile of ashes were left on the ground.If the people who came to hunt Spirit Beasts saw this, they would definitely be cursing and swearing. The Bloodmoon Demonic Bear could be said to be the most profitable Spirit Beast in the outskirts of Seven Horn Mountain. Its paw, gall bladder, skin, and heart all had a rather high market value. If they were fortunate enough and were able to obtain its Spirit Core, it would be like striking the jackpot. It was rare to find someone who would completely burn and eviscerate the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear to this degree.Looking at the skeleton on the ground, Xiao Chen did not feel that it was a pity. He was not here to kill Spirit Beasts. If he needed money, he could just refine some pills. There was no need to waste time killing Spirit Beasts and collecting their parts and viscera.Looking for a sturdy tree branch, Xiao Chen strung up the skeleton of the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear. This would serve as a warning to both cultivators or Spirit Beast coming to look for trouble.After he tidied everything up, Xiao Chen took out a Fasting Pill and swallowed it. He circulated his energy to aid in the absorption of the medicinal contents before he took out the Essence Nurturing Pill and swallowed it as well.Seating in a crossed-legged position, he began to circulate the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation. Sinking down into his consciousness, Xiao Chen could clearly feel the medicinal effect of the Essence Nurturing Pill. The Spiritual Energy that had been absorbed into his body was now thrice as dense. This would boost Xiao Chen\u2019s cultivating speed significantly.The Purple Thunder Divine Incantation was just a cultivating technique. It was different from the realms of martial cultivation. There was no bottleneck to breaking through to the next layer. Once they reached a certain level, they would naturally enter into the next layer. Furthermore, the first layer of the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation was just the foundation; even without the help of the Essence Nurturing Pill, he would be able to break through to the second layer within the next three or four months.However, the time for the Promise of Ten Years was fast approaching, and the amount of time Xiao Chen had left was limited. If he wanted to defeat Zhang He by slowly improving, it would simply be foolish thinking.There was an entire realm of difference, and some, between a Medial Grade Martial Master and an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple. There was naturally a great difference between a Martial Master and Martial Disciple. Once one became a Martial Master, one would be able to project their Essence into the atmosphere. The Essence stored in the body would be of much higher purity and quantity than what is available to a Martial Disciple.The most important thing was the proficiency they had in controlling their Martial Spirit. After advancing to this realm, the Martial Spirit would be able to leave the body. They would be able to freely control their Martial Spirit, just as Xiao Yulan did\u2014using her Martial Spirit to leave her body and successfully slay a Martial Grand Master.Even if there was some trickery involved, when a Martial Disciple goes up against a Martial Grand Master, regardless of what said person does, they would never be able to kill a Martial Grand Master.Within the next four months of time, regardless of how talented he was, he would not be able to breakthrough to Martial Master. Thus, for Xiao Chen to defeat Zhang He, he could only bank on the miraculous Purple Thunder Divine Incantation.Once the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation advanced to the second layer, there would be a qualitative leap in his abilities. He would acquire the most foundational sense of an Immortal Cultivator\u2014Spiritual Sense. With Spiritual Sense, he would be capable of performing the mystical spells written down in the Compendium of Cultivation, and last but not least, he would be able to draw talismans, forge equipment, and even lay down formations.This was how Xiao Chen intended to surpass his realm as a Martial Disciple and defeat the Martial Master Zhang He!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 31:\u00a0Spiritual Sense AppearsWith the assistance of the Fasting Pill, Xiao Chen no longer needed spend time nor thought on covering his daily sustenance for the entire next month. He could immerse himself fully in his cultivation. As opposed to the other regular cultivators, he could save a significant amount of time. As the only caveat, it was difficult to describe in words just what sort of agonizing loneliness one would experience by throwing away all connections to mortality.Undergoing such bitter cultivation in complete seclusion was even drier and duller than incessantly refining medicine in his room. However, ever since the first day he arrived into this world, Xiao Chen understood that this was a world where the weak were \u2018eaten\u2019 by the strong. Only the strong deserved respect and glory.On the road of cultivation, there were no shortcuts. There was no such thing as profit without effort. Such things only happen in\u00a0fiction. In this world, only by withstanding long periods of extreme loneliness, and putting in tons of hard work, could one become a true expert.Thus, Xiao Chen tirelessly cultivated day after day. Occasionally, there were birds that flew by or the crawling sound of bugs, but he simply paid them no mind. He was entirely focused on the mysterious act of cultivation.Xiao Chen kept his eyes shut for seven days before suddenly opening them wide, and a purple gleam flashed in both of his eyes. Xiao Chen got up to stretched his stiff body and took a deep breath. His entire body felt very comfortable.Seven days, seven whole days. With the assistance of the Essence Nurturing Pill, the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation had finally overcome the threshold to the second layer. It almost seemed as though success was a guaranteed outcome for him, as there was nothing blocking his way to progress, a way incomparably smooth and unhindered.With the pill\u2019s miraculous effect and the dense Spiritual Energy of the surrounding area, it was not strange for him to be able to break into the second layer of the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation this swiftly.Now that the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation had reached the second layer, he would unlock Spiritual Sense. Xiao Chen was extremely excited. He hurriedly followed the method in the Compendium of Cultivation, trying to feel the Spiritual Sense in his sea of consciousness.After a short moment, a world he had heretofore never seen before unraveled itself in front of him. In that boundless space, a green sphere hung in the sky, emitting a faint luminescence. This was Xiao Chen\u2019s Mental World.With just a thought, the mental space turned into a luxurious palace in an instant. It was indeed the same as what was recorded in the Compendium of Cultivation. He was the master of this Mental World, so whatever he desired, he would be able to make.This Spiritual Sense was actually the will of the cultivator that exists in one\u2019s sea of consciousness. It was actually the same thing as the will a regular person had in their heart. The difference for a cultivator was that, after upgrading it to a certain threshold, it would be capable of mobility, or even take a form. This palace in his mental space was the manifestation of Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense.The next step was to release the Spiritual Sense out of the body. With just a thought, the Spiritual Sense in his body began to surge out. In an instant, a projection of the world within a radius of roughly 500 meters around Xiao Chen began to take shape in his sea of consciousness. He could see every plant or beast as though he was seeing them with his own eyes.No, it was even better than seeing it with his own eyes. Xiao Chen could even feel the breath of these beasts, their pulse, the beating of their heart\u2026\u2026Suddenly, that green sphere in his mental space seemed as though it was not willing to be left alone and came out to join Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense. After it came out, it actually merged with his Spiritual Sense.After the Spiritual Sense and Spiritual Awareness merged together, the combined sense started to rapidly scan the surrounding plants. Soon, there were more things appearing in Xiao Chen\u2019s sea of consciousness.Once the herbs that were hidden amongst the weed were discovered, information like the medicinal properties and age actually appeared in Xiao Chen\u2019s sea of consciousness.He was surprised. After his Spiritual Sense merged with his Spiritual Awareness, they actually had the function of searching for herbs. Not far from Xiao Chen, there were a few extremely well-hidden herbs.Withdrawing his Spiritual Sense, Xiao Chen headed to the area that was just scanned. Indeed, there were a few stalks of white Wind Spirit Grass behind a bunch of weeds. Behind the Wind Spirit Grass, there was also a scarlet fruit.This Wind Spirit Grass seemed to have aged for roughly ten years, so its medicinal properties were excellent. As for the scarlet fruit behind, it was the far more precious and evidently recently matured Red Nascent Fruit.The Red Nascent Fruit was fire attributed. To cultivators who cultivated fire-attributed techniques, it would be extremely helpful. In many high-grade pills, this Red Nascent Fruit was also an important chief ingredient.Xiao Chen did not expect such a gain when he utilized his Spiritual Sense for the first time. After thinking about it, he realized that it was not strange for there to be some low-grade natural treasures in this vicinity. Amongst the areas around the outskirts of Seven Horn Mountain, this was the place with the densest Spiritual Energy.It was a pity that he came in a hurry and did not bring anything for storing herbs. If he picked them impetuously and was not able to store them properly, the value of the herb would significantly decrease. He could only wait till he was about to go down the mountain before picking it.Recovering from the surprise, Xiao Chen started to recall some of the entry-level spells in the Compendium of Cultivation. As he was not able to build a foundation and condense a core, he could only cultivate mainly as a Martial Cultivator. Immortal techniques could only play a supporting role. Hence, he had to find some spells helpful for battles.There were many entry-level spells in the Compendium of Cultivation, many of which were useless in this world. Xiao Chen pondered for quite a long time before finally deciding which spells to practice.Gravity Spell, an entry level spell, grants usage of gravity, allowing one to float in the air for a short moment. While it could not achieve the effects of flight, it was a pretty good choice when one\u2019s cultivation realm was low.Xiao Chen placed this Gravity Spell on the top of his list. Aside from the above reason, the Gravity Spell could also be upgraded. When it was cultivated to the great perfection, one would be able to fly like the wind, traveling thousands of meters in an instant and still only consume an extremely small amount of Essence.After he made his decision, Xiao Chen began practicing. Circulating his Essence in the pattern as described by the Compendium of Cultivation, a repelling force suddenly pulsed up and down his legs. His whole body seemed weightless as it slowly floated into the air.\u201cBang!\u201dXiao Chen, who had entered this state for the first time, was not mentally prepared. When he stopped circulating his Essence, he plummeted to the ground all of a sudden.\u201cThat was painful\u2026\u2026\u201d Xiao Chen smiled as he dusted himself off. Although he made a mistake on his first attempt, he now had a general idea of how it worked. He should be able to get a grasp on it after a few more tries. After all, it was just an entry-level spell.For the next few times, Xiao Chen carefully executed the spell before finally discovering the trick behind it. The principles behind the Gravity Spell was simple: it caused him to enter a weightless state, allowing him to float into the air. Once he got used to being in a weightless state, it was no longer that difficult.After he familiarized himself with it, Xiao Chen began flying from tree to tree, as though he was just having fun. Although this was not true flight, the feeling of being in the air and controlling his movement freely was fresh to him.This temporary flight gave rise to a thought in Xiao Chen\u2019s heart. If one day, his realm was high enough, how would it feel like to fly like the wind and wander around the world?Following that, Xiao Chen started to practice three other spells\u2014Heavenly Lightning Shield, Lightning Descends, and Lightning Evasion. In the short term, Xiao Chen did not intend to practice other spells. He understood the principle of not biting off more than one could chew.These three spells were extremely practical lighting-attributed spells. Heavenly Lightning Shield, as its name suggests, created a shield made of lightning to defend against attacks. Lightning Descends, essentially summoning a bolt of lightning from the heavens to strike the target. Lightning Evasion, as the name suggests is about using the force of lightning to rapidly leave the battleground.Originally, he wanted the Earthen Escape instead of the Lightning Evasion because its effects were better. However, it was a pity that Xiao Chen cultivated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation. It would be much more difficult to execute an earth attribute spell. Thus, he just made do with what he had.Spending the entire day on this, Xiao Chen practiced these spells quite diligently. The surrounding thick trees were excellent targets. Countless of Lightning Descends were summoned, immediately splitting the trees into two. The non-stop rumbling continued all the way till the middle of the night before they stopped.This was because Xiao Chen had exhausted all the Essence in his body. Swallowing another Essence Nurturing Pill, Xiao Chen sat once again in a cross-legged position and cultivated. After the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation reached the second layer, Xiao Chen\u2019s rate of absorption of Spiritual Energy increased once again. The three white clouds by the Azure Dragon rapidly filled up once again.Xiao Chen used to think that Essence came from the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit. It was only till later, after he got more familiar with Essence that he realized such was not the case. The nucleus of his Essence should be the three white clouds beside the Azure Dragon.These white clouds were not actually white clouds; they were actually a cloud shaped substance formed of Essence. Floating by the Azure Dragon, the two of them had a faint connection. With Xiao Chen\u2019s current realm, he was still unable to figure what that connection was.The only thing that Xiao Chen was clear on was that when the fourth cloud appeared, he would have stepped into the Medial Grade Martial Disciple realm. When that time came, his Essence capacity would have increased once again.\u2026...On the morning of the second day, Xiao Chen opened his eyes and stretched his body. Sending out his Spiritual Sense, he did not discover anyone within 500 meters.His Spiritual Sense was indeed useful. Not only could it differentiate herbs, it could even be used to scan his surroundings to check for hidden enemies.\u00a0This was much stronger than the perception of regular cultivators.Gravity Spell!He chanted the spell name in his heart and began to float up shortly after. He was now much more familiar with this spell than he was yesterday. Xiao Chen, who was in midair, looked at the ground beneath his feet and shouted lightly.Heavenly Lightning Shield!A triangular Lightning Shield appeared, protecting Xiao Chen. The Lightning Shield was purple and gave off a faint red glow. This was the result of forming it with a pure lightning-attributed energy. Xiao Chen estimated that it could withstand the full force blow of a\u00a0Martial Grand Master.Lightning Descends!Xiao Chen, still in the air, pointed with his finger as a lightning bolt as thick as a bowl descended from the heavens. A thick tree on the ground was immediately blasted apart with a boom. Its might was able to rival a Profound Grade Martial Technique. Furthermore, it descended from the skies. With its speed, it would be difficult for the target to evade.Lightning Evasion!He executed the final spell. Xiao Chen\u2019s body immediately disappeared and there was a loud thunder roar about a hundred meters in front as a bright bolt of lightning fell from the sky. Xiao Chen\u2019s figure appeared from the electrical light in midair, unharmed.After he practiced the four spells once, Xiao Chen slowly descended and stopped practicing. This was because he had more important things to do today.Forging! To forge something that Xiao Chen had desired for a really long time\u2014a Spatial Ring\u2026...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 32:\u00a0Universe RingSi!A strand of purple flames appeared on Xiao Chen\u2019s palm before suddenly erupting. The thin flame turned into a raging inferno. He raised his hands gently and the flames soared into the air and hovered there.This was the advantage of having Spiritual Sense. After attaining Spiritual Sense, Xiao Chen gained a firmer control over the Purple Thunder True Fire. The flames, which were controlled by Spiritual Sense, were like an extension of Xiao Chen\u2019s arms. The sensation and control involved was incomparable.Afterwards, he took out a broken sword and shifted his gaze away from the flames. This broken sword was the one he had obtained from the Thunder Emperor\u2019s cave. Xiao Chen had investigated it for a long time, but aside from it being sharp, he could not unearth anything special about it.However, what he could not deny was that the quality of the sword\u2019s make was very good. The making of the Universe Ring constituted high criterias for the materials involved. Coincidentally, this broken sword was able to meet those strict demands.Perhaps it had once been a divine-level Spirit Weapon, but it was at present merely a broken sword, so there was not much use to it. However, using it to forge the Universe Ring was no different from treating it as trash.Thus, Thunder Emperor, please don\u2019t blame me for this, Xiao Chen thought in his heart.He tossed the broken sword into the middle of the purple fire. Immediately after, he controlled the purple fire to burn vigorously. At this point in time, he needed the temperature of the purple flames to keep rising all the way to an extreme. Such was the only method by which he could melt the broken sword.Without any question, this exhausted a lot of\u00a0Essence. As the temperature of the purple fire continued to rise, its color turned deeper and deeper. However, there were no changes to the broken sword; it just stayed quietly within the purple fire.Very soon, out of the three white clouds beside the Azure Dragon, one faded away. Xiao Chen wiped the sweat off his forehead and continued to raise the temperature of the Purple Thunder True Fire. Xiao Chen wanted to turn it into a liquid form by today.When the three cloud were all close to fading away, the azure broken sword finally underwent some change. It slowly started to melt from one end and began to turn into an azure viscous fluid that changed into its molten form shortly after.Xiao Chen\u2019s expression turned warm as he swallowed a Qi Returning Pill, rapidly recovering the Essence in his body. As time went by, more of the broken sword\u2019s surface turned into the azure viscous fluid. Drop by drop, the azure molten metal gathered within the purple flames.After a long time, he had finally thoroughly melted this mysterious broken sword down to molten ore.Using his Spiritual Sense, he controlled the molten liquid made from the broken sword and gathered it into a liquid ball. As he continued to refine it, columns of azure smoke came out of the purple flames. As he did this, all of the remaining impurities were expunged, purifying the liquid even further .After he cleared out the impurities, Xiao Chen pictured the image of a ring in his sea of consciousness. The azure molten metal, made by melting the broken sword in the purple flames, continuously changed its shape, eventually resembling a crudely-made ring.The next step was to establish a space. What Xiao Chen intended to forge was not a Spatial Ring that had a large space. Thus, it was not difficult to establish the space, and all he had to do was\u00a0inscribe\u00a0a spatial formation on the ring.Gathering his Spiritual Sense in the ring, a vast world appeared before Xiao Chen\u2019s eyes. It seemed as though his whole body had merged with the purple flames. At this moment, the Spiritual Sense was like the embodiment of Xiao Chen. It stood within the ring, incessantly carving the talisman scripts used for laying down formations.Within the inner wall of the ring within the purple fire, all sorts of talisman scripts began to appear, engraved with extreme granularity. As Xiao Chen carved them, he tried to remember the talisman scripts for Spatial Formations recorded in the Compendium of Cultivation. If he carved just one part of it wrongly, he would have to redo the entire thing. Therefore, Xiao Chen took his time with it rather than rushing and inadvertently committing a mistake.After completing carving the talisman scripts on the inner wall, Xiao Chen withdrew his consciousness and designed the final look of the ring as the purple fire slowly burned on ever-steady. After a short moment of adjustments, Xiao Chen extinguished the Purple Thunder True Fire and stretched out his hand, catching the Universe Ring that was falling out of the air.Making a cut on his index finger, he dripped a drop of fresh blood onto the ring. When the blood came into contact with the Universe Ring, it would become bound to him.\u201cHa Ha!\u201dIn the instant the blood was completely absorbed, Xiao Chen was shunted into a dazed state of mind for a brief second. He could have sworn he heard a melodious laughter. However, by the time he was fully alert, the sound was gone.Could I be hallucinating?\u00a0Xian Chen looked at the azure ring in his hand and muttered.\u00a0Doesn\u2019t matter, so long as it was successful.A Universe Ring with a hundred cubic meters of space. According to the records of the Compendium of Cultivation, this was not difficult to forge. It was only the first step on the road of craftsmanship for an Immortal Cultivator. Back when Earth still had Immortal Cultivators, every cultivator in their foundational stage would forge a Universe Ring for their first forging.Wearing the Yin-Yang ring on the index finger of his right hand, Xiao Chen sent out a strand of Spiritual Sense, entering into it. A pitch-black space appeared in front of his eyes. This was the space within the Universe Ring.Although it was just a hundred cubic meters, Xiao Chen was still more than satisfied. He no longer had to be envious of the First Elder\u2019s and Feng Feixue\u2019s spatial rings anymore.Universe RingComing to the place where the Red Nascent Fruit was, Xiao Chen first went to pick the few blades of Wind Spirit Grass and placed them in the Yinyang Ring. Looking at the recently matured Red Nascent Fruit, Xiao Chen revealed a smile on his face.\u00a0I can no longer wait for you to grow anymore, this Young Master will harvest you today!The Universe Ring had a sealed space within it. When taking out the things inside it, the item in question would be exactly as it was when it was placed inside it, even if should it be after ten thousand years. Thus, Xiao Chen could feel assured when he placed these herbs into it.In the instant that Xiao Chen got up, he picked up the sound of faint footsteps in the vicinity. After attaining his Spiritual Sense, his six senses had turned exceptionally sensitive. They were definitely not at this level in the past.Xiao Chen frowned slightly and immediately sent out his Spiritual Sense. Everything within a radius of 500 meters around Xiao Chen clearly appeared within his mind. A group of cultivators had stopped by the skeleton of the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear and were discussing something in low voices.It was actually some individuals from the Tang Clan.\u00a0What were they doing here?\u00a0After getting a clear visual on their attires, suspicions began to take root in Xiao Chen\u2019s heart. There was a group of ten Tang Clan disciples, and each one of them were at least a Superior Grade Martial Disciple. Amongst them, there was an old man who gave off the fluctuations of a Martial Grand Master.Out of the three great clans of Mohe City, the Tang Clan was the most low-key and silent. Many years ago, this clan was just a small clan. When those local clans did their best to attack the Xiao Clan, the Tang Clan had just ignored both sides.Of the few large-scale battles with the local clans, the Tang Clan had not participated. As those big local clans slowly exhausted their strength and began to gradually lose their influence, the Tang Clan simply quietly grew and expanded until it became one of the three great clans of Mohe City.In every battle for the rights to Seven Horn Mountain in the Promise of Ten Years, the Tang Clan would choose to forfeit. In the open rivalry and veiled strife between the Xiao Clan and Zhang Clan, the attitude of the Tang Clan was elusive.The Tang Clan, an oddly low-key clan within Mohe City.When the old man saw the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear\u2019s skeleton hanging on the tree, there was a slight change to his expression. He faced one of the young men and spoke with caution, \u201cFirst Young Master, I think we better leave soon. Our mission is important, something is wrong here.\u201dXiao Chen recognized the young man leading the group. He was the first son of the Tang Clan clan head\u2014Tang Yuan. Normally, he was very low-profile and would normally avoid overstepping his boundaries.Tang Yuan took a look at the skeleton of the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear hanging on the tree, but he did not hold it in much regard. It was merely a Rank 2 Spirit Beast, something he could kill by himself as well. He replied with a smile, \u201cSecond Uncle, I have been here before in the past and have discovered a Red Nascent Fruit that had yet to mature. After such a long period of time, I believe it should have matured already.\u201dWhen the old man heard the words \u2018Red Nascent Fruit\u2019, his face immediately revealed an excited expression. The technique he practiced was fire-attributed. This Red Nascent Fruit would be of great help to him. If he was fortunate, after consuming it, his cultivation might even advance by a grade.The only issue was that, when he saw the skeleton of the Bloodmoon Demonic Bear, he felt some distress in his heart. He himself cultivated fire-attributed techniques, thus he could immediately tell how this Bloodmoon Demonic Bear had been burned clean by an extremely tyrannical flame. Furthermore, it had been burned alive! Aside from the very solid bones, the rest had turned into ashes.With his current strength, he was barely be able to create a flame of this level.Tang Yuan noticed the old man\u2019s hesitation and smiled, \u201cSecond Uncle, there are so many of us here. Aside from you, a Martial Grand Master, we still have seven Superior Grade Martial\u00a0Disciples.\u00a0As long as it\u2019s not a Martial saint, we won\u2019t be in any danger. Furthermore, the location of the Red Nascent Fruit is rather well-hidden. There should not be anyone else discovering it.\u201dThe Old Man was in fact thinking of the same thing in his heart. Now that the young man had advised the same, he stopped hesitating, \u201cThen let\u2019s hurry up, and make sure there are no accidents. Our mission is the most important.\u201dA smile blossomed on Tang Yuan\u2019s face, as he thought in his heart,\u00a0Now that the Second Elder has gained benefits from me and the Third Elder is already on my side, it means that two out of the three elders are supporting me. I wonder how are you going to compete with me.Under the leadership of Tang Yuan, the group of people made their way to the location of the Red Nascent Fruit in a grandiose manner. With a smile on his face, Tang Yuan parted a group of weeds. When he saw nothing but an empty spot of soil, the smile on his face froze.What\u2019s going on?\u00a0Tang Yuan thought suspiciously. One must know that the last time he found the Red Nascent Fruit, it was through a coincidence that was extremely hard to come by. If it was not for the fact that it was not mature when he first found it, he would have picked it for himself long ago.How could anyone else ever conceive that there would be a Red Nascent Fruit behind a bunch of weeds?The old man behind Tang Yuan looked at the freshly upturned ground with a gloomy expression before coldly stating, \u201cthis was just freshly harvested; the smell of the earth is still quite fresh.\u201dTang Yuan angrily pounded on the ground for a few times, turning around to apologize, \u201cSecond Uncle, I\u2019m sorry to have made you come all this way for nothing. Had I known earlier, I would have just picked it regardless of its state of maturity.\u201dThe old man shook his head and revealed a faint smile, \u201cWe might not have made this trip for nothing.\u201d\u201cBoom!\u201dAfter he said this, the old man pointed his finger at a location he had been looking towards. A flaming bird erupted from his body, instantly turning into a huge flaming bird that gave off a melodious cry. Immediately after, it flew towards a large tree in front while emitting powerful waves of heat.Before the flaming bird managed to approach the tree, the heat waves it gave off caused the tree to burn up. Xiao Chen, who was hiding behind it, quickly revealed himself and jumped to another tree.Before he could steady himself, the flaming bird gave off another cry and both increased in size and accelerated in speed by an entire fold. A heat wave split apart the air, creating a long flaming tail as it rapidly zeroed in on Xiao Chen.Xiao Chen jumped down from the tree in a hurry before a violent explosion occurred behind him. Intense wave of heat struck him from behind. Under such tremendous force, Xiao Chen fell to the ground in a sorry state.When he looked at the big tree again, it had already been blasted into smithereens. Under the high temperature, it was immediately burnt to ashes. A large plume of white smoke scattered from it in every direction.The white smoke entered Xiao Chen\u2019s nose. Xiao Chen, who had just risen to his feet, started to cough. Amidst the smoke, the flaming bird cried out again, and its size and speed increased by another fold. It had at this point reached a terrifying level of speed. After the smoke parted, Xiao Chen could see that the flaming bird was now the size of a small car.Damn! It\u2019s coming again!Looking at the flaming bird chasing him closely, Xiao Chen cursed in his heart.\u00a0Are they truly treating me as a pushover? Trying to bully me like this.Heavenly Lightning Shield!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 34": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33:\u00a0How Could It Be?\u201cBoom!\u201dThe huge flaming bird smashed mercilessly onto Xiao Chen\u2019s Heavenly Lightning Shield. It resulted in a loud explosion, before filling the skies with sparks. After a while, all the sparks flew towards the old man, entering back into his body. The scene looked like a field of fireflies gravitating towards the old man.A deep pit about five meters wide appeared on the ground. The rocks had been blasted into powder, filling the surroundings with dust. Xiao Chen, who was in the deep pit, turned incredibly pale but had yet to suffer any major injuries.With dust flying everywhere, no one was able to clearly see the situation in the pit. When Tang Yuan saw this, he laughed, \u201cSecond Uncle, after being hit by your\u00a0Triple Burst Flaming Bird, even if he wasn\u2019t dead, he\u2019d be seriously injured.\u201dThe old man revealed a smug expression. The Triple Burst Flaming Bird was a Profound Ranked Martial Technique that he was very proud of. It used his ability to control his Martial Spirit, making it leave his body and attack the enemy.Each time the flaming bird cried out, it would rapidly absorb the fire-attributed energy from its surroundings, resulting in the doubling of its might and speed. After the third cry, even if a regular Martial Disciple used everything they had, they would still be burnt to ashes.Earlier, in an instant,r, he had already determined that the person hiding behind the tree was just an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple. He did not believe that the person would be able to survive .\u201cGo, take a look. I hope that the medicine was not damaged.\u201dThe old man said with some remorse. He had made his move too hastily earlier and used a big move from the start. Now that he thought about it, he had overreacted. If the herb was damaged, then it would not have been worth it.At this moment, amidst the dust cloud, a blurry figure appeared in the deep pit. Although they could not clearly tell his appearance, the aura coming from him was exuberant, indicating that the person was not injured at all.\u201cHow could this be!?\u201dThe group of Tang Clan cultivators all exclaimed in shock. The old man\u2019s face filled with an expression of disbelief.He\u2019s clearly just an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple, how could he have blocked my Profound Ranked Martial Technique? That makes no sense.Xiao Chen, who was still in the dust cloud, did not reveal himself. Instead, he used his Spiritual Sense to see their expressions and scan for the positions of each person. As all the information appeared in his mind, the corners of his mouth curled up as he revealed a dangerous smile.Did it feel good to attack me? Well, it\u2019s my turn now!Xiao Chen smiled in his heart as he pointed towards the sky with his right hand while his left hand continually made hand seals. Soon the sky rumbled with sounds of thunder.Despite the previous clear skies, all of a sudden, large black clouds started to gather. The forest instantly turned incomparably gloomy, as if a thunderstorm was arriving, which was extremely strange..Lightning Descends!Lightning Descends!Lightning Descends!\u201cBoom! Boom! Boom! Boom! \u2026\u2026\u201dXiao Chen was merciless, he had used all the Essence within his body and summoned at least ten bolts of lightning. He would not attack unless he was attacked; if he was attacked, he would certainly return the favor tenfold.Coming from the black clouds, at least ten bolts of lightning streaked across the sky, causing the forest to be brightly illuminated, and glaring to everyone who saw it.Seeing the sky darkening, the group of people from the Tang Clan were astonished. The weather was just fine a moment ago, why did it suddenly changed? How strange!\u201cCrap! This is a high ranked Martial Technique. All of you, be careful!\u201d The old man shouted loudly, feeling very anxious.Although hearing the words of the old man, before they had a chance to react, lightning bolts descended from the sky. Soon, after the sounds of thunder, there were cries of agony.After the black clouds cleared away, most of the people from the Tang Clan were lying on the ground, burnt till they looked like charcoal, black smoke coming out of their mouths and noses.Three Superior Grade Martial Disciples died on the spot, giving off a\u00a0barbecued\u00a0smell.Tang Yuan got up from the ground, looking like he was in a sorry state. There were lingering fears in his heart when he saw the three roasted Superior Grade Martial Disciples. If the old man hadnot protected him earlier, he would have now been like those people\u2014roasted black.\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026 what Martial Technique is this\u2026\u2026\u201d Tang Yuan asked with a quivering voice and a terrified expression.The old man remained expressionless as he looked at that figure behind the cloud of dust. He muttered: \u201cLightning attribute, Earth Ranked Martial Technique, Earth Ranked Martial Technique\u2026\u2026\u201dEarth Ranked Martial Technique, even the rich and powerful clans of the Great Qin Nation did not have many of them, treating and protecting it as though it was treasure. Who in the world was this person and what kind of status did he have?Not only was he good at using fire, he even had a lightning-attributed Earth Ranked Martial Technique. Was he a cultivator with dual attributes?The misgivings in his heart grew even deeper, and before the old man gave it anymore more thought, he immediately rushed forward. After killing so many of his Tang Clan members, he could not let him escape. If he was truly from one of those powerful and influential clans, then all the more should he kill him.Otherwise, if he were allowed to return, he might decide to take revenge. With the power of those clans, his tiny Tang Clan would not be able to survive.Using an Earth Ranked Martial Technique as an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple, there was bound to be a great expenditure of Essence and rebound. He could not give him a chance to recover.Swallowing a Qi Returning Pill as he observed the situation of the Tang Clan members, Xiao Chen was very satisfied with the lethality of the Lightning Descends that was used with his full power.The old man\u2019s move earlier was a lethal one. If he had not learned the Heavenly Lightning Shield, even if he had not died, he would still be gravely injured. Hence, there was no need to be merciful to this group of people. Since he was going to make a move, he may as well go all outXiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense could feel the old man rushing over but Xiao Chen did not feel anxious at all. The Qi Returning Pill had already started to take effect and his Essence was recovering.Seeing the approaching old man, Xiao Chen inwardly shouted,\u00a0Lightning Evasion!Right before the old man reached the pit, he took a look at the not so far off Xiao Chen and smiled.\u00a0Regardless of which clan\u2019s genius you are, you are going to have to answer to me.However, just at this moment, Xiao Chen\u2019s body suddenly disappeared and a bolt of lightning appeared about a hundred meters in front. The old man raised his head to look at that bolt of lightning, and once the electrical light diminished, Xiao Chen\u2019s figure appeared.What Martial Technique was this?The old man was astonished, he raised the Essence in his body to its extremes and quickly advanced forward, making movements akin to that of a sly rabbit. He had to kill him, or else the consequences would be dire. The old man anxiously thought this as his speed explosively increased.Feeling the old man behind him, Xiao Chen dashed forward by a few steps then used the Lightning Evasion again. After the electrical light faded, Xiao Chen once again appeared another hundred meters ahead.Seeing Xiao Chen escaping further, the old man shouted angrily. A surging flame appeared on his body, forming a pair of flaming wings. After the wings fully extended, it reached two meters wide.Taking light steps, his body moved rapidly in the air. The trees in his way were burnt through, effectively cutting them into two, leaving behind a path of burning tree stumps.Martial Spirit Possession, it was an ability that one could grasp only after becoming a Martial Grand Master. In the Tianwu Continent, few people had the very rare flying beast type Martial Spirit.For those people, after their Martial Spirit left their body, they could grow wings. However, it was a lot more limited when compared to true flight.The Martial Spirit Possession of the Martial Grand Masters was not a true merger with the Martial Spirit. Thus, it could only result in short distance gliding. Furthermore, it consumed a tremendous amount of Essence, which meant that the state could not be maintained for long.To achieve a true merger with the Martial Spirit, one had to be at least a Martial King. By that time, they would be able to fly as high as they wanted and the amount of time that it could be sustained would lengthen. Even the drain on Essence would be much lower.Seeing the old man undergo Martial Spirit Possession and drawing closer to him, Xiao Chen helplessly swallowed another Qi Returning Pill and the speed of his Essence recovery increased significantly once again. As for the side effects of consuming the pill too many times, he could not consider it at that current time.\u201cTriple Burst Flaming Bird!\u201dThe old man shouted angrily. Seeing that Xiao Chen drew nearer to him, he used his Medial Grade Profound Ranked Martial Technique once again. He gave up on trying to conserve Essence as he was worried that Xiao Chen would use that strange escaping technique again.Because this Martial Technique utilized his Martial Spirit, after he executed it, the flaming wings on his back left his body and turned into a huge bird. After it cried out, it flew towards Xiao Chen.With the assistance of two Qi Returning Pill, Xiao Chen\u2019s Essence recovery speed reached a terrifying level. Out of the three white clouds beside the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit in his body, two of them had already recovered.Seeing the flaming bird flying towards him, Xiao Chen\u2019s brain worked furiously. After a short moment, he fully understood the situation. If he used the Lightning Evasion now, he would not be able to make it in time. He would be interrupted at the last moment.It was also impossible to evade it as after the flaming bird cried out again, its speed and might would double. Since he was currently not in his peak state, it would be unwise to use the Heavenly Lightning Shield to defend against it head-on.He could only take advantage of the fact that the bird had only cried out once so far; while its might was still relatively lower, he could defeat it. Once he thought it through, he immediately took action. Xiao Chen was not the kind of person who would do a sloppy job. He immediately took out Lunar Shadow from the Universe Ring.Rushing Thunder Chop!Xiao Chen, who had always had his back facing the old man, suddenly turned around and shouted. His figure moved like lightning and chopped at the flaming bird.With the assistance of the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit, even his ordinary strike was comparable to that of a peak Martial Disciple. Now that he was using a Martial Technique, the strength that he had was naturally raised by many folds.A resplendent glow appeared on the Lunar Shadow saber. Seeing the nearing flaming bird, Xiao Chen could feel the heat waves on his face. He squinted his eyes slightly, looking at the fierce head of the flaming bird.Xiao Chen stomped down and calmly made his move, accurately chopping on the neck of the flaming bird. The two horrifying forces clashed against each other, resulting in an intense explosion. A stream of heat waves traveled in all directions and every tree within ten meters broke in an instant.The huge force had rebounded from the saber back to Xiao Chen\u2019s body. Xiao Chen vomited a mouthful of fresh blood, his body flew backward in midair until he crashed into a big tree.With a loud \u2018boom\u2019, the tree was immediately broken. Xiao Chen fell onto the ground and vomited another mouthful of blood.He had miscalculated, he had never used this Rushing Thunder Chop before. He expected too much from it and had actually wanted to use it against a Profound Ranked Martial Technique of a Martial Grand Master. Xiao Chen, who was lying on the ground, smiled bitterly. Even if the Azure Dragon was that powerful, a Yellow Ranked Martial Technique was still a Yellow Ranked Martial Technique in the end.I\u2019ve finally dealt with this fellow, I have not wasted so much of my strength in vain.\u00a0The old man from the Tang Clan could finally breathe easy. Before he had the opportunity to recover his Essence, he immediately rushed towards Xiao Chen.After clearly seeing Xiao Chen\u2019s appearance, the old man looked like he had seen a ghost. After quite a while, he laughed loudly as he spoke hoarsely: \u201cI, Tang He, had been chasing you for half a day, thinking that you were some genius from some big clan. Causing me to be in such a sorry state, I had never expected that you would be the\u00a0trash from the Xiao Clan.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tang He acted as though he had planned everything out, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t kill the three people from my Tang Clan, on the account of the Xiao Clan, I could have let you off after you handed over the Red Nascent Fruit.\u201dXiao Chen\u2019s pale face revealed a cold smile, \u201cStop being so hypocritical. If you hadn\u2019t attempted to kill me first, would I have made a move against your group?\u201dGrasping Lunar Shadow tightly in his hands, Xiao Chen coughed lightly as he continued, \u201cDo you actually think that I have no way of resisting you?\"Tang He stared blankly for a while before laughing loudly, \u201cAlthough I had exhausted a large portion of my Essence, there should still be more than enough to deal with a several injured Inferior Grade Martial Disciple. All I would need is just one finger.\u201dDespicable, this was a Martial Grand Master going against an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple. In terms of strength, the difference between them was like heaven and earth. Xiao Chen held an undisguised look of contempt.Return of the Azure Dragon was the first move of the Heaven Ranked Martial Technique, Dragon Subduing Slash. This was the exclusive Martial Technique of the Azure Dragon Martial Technique. When using it, one would be able to leap over the seas like a dragon in a majestic and powerful manner.According to the legends, the Hidden Dragon Of The Abyss was the king of the four seas and Dragon Soaring Through the Universe was the tyrant of the sky. As long as there was water, it would be able to display boundless might. Return Of The Azure Dragon referred to the dragon leaping out of the sea, bearing the might of the sea, and causing even the rivers to flow backwards.[TL Notes: Honestly, I\u2019m not too sure of this paragraph and might change the translation of this in the future]Xiao Chen thought silently in his heart, the Return of The Azure Dragon was just the introductory move with regards to the Dragon Subduing Slash. Looking at Tang He, who had an incredibly complex expression, he smiled, \u201cOne finger\u2026 Don\u2019t cry from shock later\u2026\u2026.\u201dTang He watched as Xiao Chen made his final struggles, as though he was a cat playing around with a mouse. At such a close distance, he was not afraid of Xiao Chen using his strange escaping techniques to flee. Not bothered by Xiao Chen\u2019s tone, he smiled, \u201cI said that I would only use one finger, thus, I will only use one finger.\u201d\u201cChi!\u201dA flame wisp gathered above Tang He\u2019s finger. Moving his Essence and shouting out, the flames flew away from his finger, creating a long trail of Qi as it streaked across the air heading for Xiao Chen\u2019s brain.Although this flame had not looked impressive, in truth, there was a huge amount of fire-attributed energy in it. Due to the fact that many of Tang He\u2019s opponents underestimated it and became careless, they had died to this flame.He did not believe that at such a distance, an injured Inferior Grade Martial Disciple would be able to withstand the destructiveness of this flame.Naturally, Xiao Chen would not be able to withstand the destructiveness of this flame but in the first place, he had never intended to face it head on. He tightly grasped Lunar Shadow in his hands and changed his posture.Raising his arm, he pointed the sharp end of his saber at Tang He!Xiao Chen had just casually changed positions and did not seem to have made any move. There was still no difference with the earlier Xiao Chen who looked heavily injured and weak.However, Tang He\u2019s right eyelid started twitching spontaneously. His mind seemed to become empty and he felt an unrelenting sense of danger.How could it be? This fellow is currently severely injured, how would he be able to injure me?\u00a0Tang He shook his head vigorously and suppressed the fear in his heart.The wisp of flames was already less than one meter away from Xiao Chen. In one second, it would penetrate through Xiao Chen\u2019s brain All it would take was a second and this fellow would be dead.Thinking of this, the fear in Tang He\u2019s heart completely disappeared. He revealed a faint smile on his face. It was time for this to end.However, at that point, Xiao Chen suddenly shouted. A boundless aura that could almost topple the mountains and seas seemed to emanate from his body. The tranquil forest reacted as though there were great waves bellowing while the continuous sound of sea waves was heard.A formless force seemed to explode out from Xiao Chen\u2019s body and all the big trees within a hundred meters behind Xiao Chen were uprooted by a strong gale, completely turning into fragments.The whole sky was filled with broken fragments, layers of them were piled up behind Xiao Chen. They looked like a great sea wave, rippling unceasingly, swaying gently.Xiao Chen felt like his body was filled with an apocalyptic power that was about to burst out of him. At that moment, he felt that even if Gods and Buddhas appeared in front of him, he had the confidence to destroy them.\u201cBreak!\u201dWith a furious shout, Xiao Chen swung lightly from his casual posture, but that small movement was filled with a huge amount of energy.This gentle strike was almost able to break through space and time, and the entire space around them fluctuated for a while. The huge sea wave made out of tree fragments gave off an explosive sound and a dragon roar came from Xiao Chen\u2019s Dantian.The huge energy traveled via Xiao Chen\u2019s arm and Lunar Shadow, then turned into a dragon shaped saber Qi and flew out. The moment the saber Qi left the blade, Lunar Shadow could no longer withstand the violent energy and shattered apart.While it took quite a while to describe this, all of these happened within a breath\u2019s worth of time. The wisp of flame that Tang He fired, was like a little worm in front of Xiao Chen\u2019s dragon shaped saber Qi and dispersed upon contact.The huge dragon shaped saber Qi had boundless might as it headed towards Tang He.\u00a0Someday, I will make the rivers flow in reverse.Tang He stared blankly at all these, he seemed to have seen a great wave in a boundless sea and that Inferior Grade Martial Disciple riding on a huge Azure Dragon, breaking out from the sea.Under the might of this ancient Holy Beast, even the Flaming Bird Martial Spirit in Tang He\u2019s body could not help but tremble. Tang His entire body trembled and his Essence inside was chaotic, refusing to obey his will.Within an instant, Tang He\u2019s body turned into dust. There was no screams of pain and had just disappeared completely. Only a red jade pendant could be seen falling.The saber of Qi did not stop at that and continued to rush forward. A huge gorge, that seemed to extend into the distance forever, appeared in the ground.This was the might of a Heaven Ranked Martial Technique, the power of the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit. It had the power to topple mountains and seas, to decimate the heavens and earth. Even when it was executed by an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple, it had such a terrifying might.In the instant Xiao Chen saw Tang He\u2019s body disintegrate into dust, Xiao Chen\u2019s state of mind relaxed. Once he relaxed, the side effects of using too many medicinal pills and executing a Heaven Ranked Martial Technique came one after another.The Essence in his body became chaotic and he had turned pale all over until his blood vessels could be seen clearly. After a moment, his skin began to tear and fresh blood continuously trickled out.This kind of pain was like having millions of ants bite at the same time; it was a pain that made one rather die instead. Within the mental space in his sea of consciousness, his Spiritual Sense was also incredibly disordered. Intense pain originated from his body and his psyche continuously tortured Xiao Chen.Struggling to maintain a clear mind, Xiao Chen dragged his dilapidated body step by step towards the gorge. The red jade pendant that dropped from Tang He\u2019s body was very suspicious.It was actually undamaged from the attack of a Heaven Ranked Martial Technique. There must have been something strange with it. With great difficulty, he managed to drag his body over and held the blood-red jade pendant in his hands. Before he had the time to take a look at it, Xiao Chen fainted from the pain.Xiao Chen was not aware of the destructive powers of a Heaven Ranked Martial Technique, and the requirements that were needed to be met in order to execute one. There were many examples in the Tianwu Continent of people overestimating themselves and executing a highly ranked Martial Technique, resulting in their body exploding.If it was not for the special characteristic of the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit, it would not be as simple as Xiao Chen fainting on the ground.In the outskirts of Seven Horn Mountain, in the area that was filled with dense Spiritual Qi, Tang Yuan and the others were anxiously waiting for their Second Elder. Looking at the sky darkening, the originally composed group of people had also started to get anxious. When they heard the loud explosion from the distance, they had gotten very scared and became on edge.After a long time, the Second Elder had still not returned. Finally, one of them could no longer hold back and asked Tang Yuan, \u201cYoung Master, should we still keep waiting for the Second Elder? The First Elder and the others are still waiting for us to bring back the Spirit Blood Jade.Tang Yuan had already cleaned his clothes and brushed the dirt on his body off but his facial expression was still pained and haggard. When he heard this question, he was not able to hold back and scolded that person, \u201cI wish to do so as well but the Spirit Blood Jade is still with Second Uncle. Even if we went, it would be useless.\u201dWhen the group of people heard this, their already anxious emotions turned even more apprehensive. This was a mission of great importance given to them by the First Elder.For the sake of this mission, not only had they sent three Superior Grade Martial Disciples and seven Martial Masters, they even sent a Martial Grand Master to lead them. With such a force, they would even be able to strut around Mohe City. Who knew that this originally simple mission would turn out like this.Once the First Elder found out about this, this group of people would be in for a terrible time.Amongst this group of people, Tang Yuan was the one that was the most at a loss. The others might not know of the uses of the Spirit Blood Jade but he was very clear about it. With such a devastating results, when he thought of the consequences, Tang Yuan shuddered.If they had not come looking for this Red Nascent Fruit, they would not have provoked that strange person. Then things would not have escalated to this point. Tang Yuan felt an incomparable regret. He blamed himself for trying to suck up to the Second Elder, for trying to be clever only to end up with making a blunder.\u201cFirst Young Master, don\u2019t be anxious. Things might not have reached an unrecoverable stage. The Second Elder might just be slightly delayed, maybe he is severely injured. We should go and check the situation out,\u201d the person who spoke earlier calmly analyzed.If the Second Elder is severely injured, wouldn\u2019t we just be seeking death?!Tang Yuan was about to start screaming in anger but after thinking things through, he slowly calmed down. The words of this person were reasonable; the Second Elder had already reached the peak of Medial Grade Martial Grand Master long ago, even if he lost to that mysterious person, that mysterious person would not be in good shape either.The most important thing was that even if the Second Elder was killed by him, that mysterious person might not necessarily take away the Spirit Blood Jade, as it would be useless to him.Thinking this, Tang Yuan\u2019s expression started to soften as he spoke to the others, \u201cWe need to retrieve that Spirit Blood Jade. Thus, regardless of the circumstances, we need to check out the place where that explosion happened.\u201dThe expressions of the others contained fear. Despite the explosion sounds coming from a far distance, they had still felt the terrifying power that was contained in it.However, when they thought of the consequence of failing this mission and weighing the pros and cons, the crowd chose to follow Tang Yuan and headed to the location of the explosion.Before long, the crowd saw a ridiculous gorge on the ground. It was three meters wide and seven meters deep and had definitely extended out for at least thousands of meters.The expression of the crowd turned extremely unsightly but under the leadership of Tang Yuan, they still headed anxiously forward until they finally saw Xiao Chen, who had fallen into the gorge.Seeing the red jade pendant in Xiao Chen\u2019s hands, Tang Yuan felt joy in his heart. He was about to step forward when suddenly, a green shadow quickly picked up Xiao Chen, rapidly leaped towards the front and quickly left.Tang Yuan stopped his subordinates that were about to give chase. His icy cold gaze watched the disappearing green shadow as he said with a cold voice, \u201cThere is no need to give chase\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After doing his best to open his eyes, he eventually managed to do so and discovered himself lying on a wooden bed.After observing his surroundings, Xiao Chen could recognize that he was in a wooden hut. The sunlight shone in from the outside, filling the hut with warmth.Not far away from the bed, there was a table. On the table were a bundle of roses and, beside it, was some home cooked food. It was all vegetarian but was still very fragrant, causing anyone who smelt it to look forward to eating the dishes.Where is this? Why am I here?\u00a0Xiao Chen thought in suspicion.He remembered that he was severely injured and\u00a0had fainted\u00a0after obtaining the red jade pendant on that day he executed the Return Of The Azure Dragon. How did he end up here?Was he rescued by someone or captured by someone?Screw it! I\u2019ll get up first.Xiao Chen pushed away the quilt unveiling his entire body which had been covered in bandages. There was the faint fragrance of medicine coming from the bandages and he suddenly felt that his skin was soft and itchy, signifying that his wounds seemed to be almost healed.Rising up, Xiao Chen entered into a state of cultivation after some difficulty. He sank his consciousness down and slowly circulated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation. He then noticed something that he had not expected; his meridians, which should have been severely damaged, had actually almost completely recovered as well.This could only be the effect of consuming a medicinal pill. It seemed like, not only did the person who brought him there had bandaged him up, he had even wasted a medicinal pill on him.After a while, Xiao Chen came out from his state of cultivation and removed the bandages layer by layer. As he removed them, his face slowly turned red, for even his private areas actually had a few layers of bandages on. If the person who bandaged him was a male\u2026\u2026 he would rather die...After removing all the bandages, his pale skin was exposed and Xiao Chen began to relax. The medicine smeared on the bandages must have been very good as there were no scars left behind, so he did not have to worry about being disfigured.There also laid a set of brand new men\u2019s clothes at the head of the bed. Xiao Chen felt consoled in his heart, this person had even prepared clothes for him. After he putting on the clothes, Xiao Chen impatiently went for the food on the table.Although after consuming the Fasting Pill, he did not need to eat or drink, after a long period of not eating or drinking, he had missed doing so. When he saw the table full of delectable food, Xiao Chen could no longer resist.Looking at the current situation, he was definitely saved. If he was captured, the enemy would not have used such good medicine or even prepare clothing for him to wear.With an incredible speed, Xiao Chen rapidly finished all the food on the table. Even though there were not fine cuisines, he felt that they had tasted even better.\u201cHey, Cousin, you\u2019re awake already,\u201d the door of the wooden hut gently pushed opened and a pleasantly surprised voice could be heard.When Xiao Chen, whose mouth was full of food, looking extremely unsightly, suddenly saw Xiao Yulan outside the door, he was startled and accidentally choked on the food, coughing continuously.After a long time, Xiao Chen recovered, \u201cCousin Yulan, Why\u2026 why are you here?\u201d he asked in an indistinct manner.Seeing Xiao Chen\u2019s appearance, Xiao Yulan giggled, her face looking as pretty as blossoming flowers. She asked in a gentle voice: \u201cCousin, take your time to eat. If it is not enough, I can make more for you.\u201dHearing these words, Xiao Chen finally understood. It was Cousin Yulan who had saved him. Casually wiping his mouth with his hands, he did not pick up the chopsticks and continue eating. After being seen eating in such a manner by Xiao Yulan, how could he dare continue eating?Suddenly, he remembered that his private areas were bandaged up as well. He looked at Xiao Yulan and pretended to ask in a nonchalant manner: \u201cCousin Yulan, did you help bandage me up?\u201dXiao Yulan nodded her head, she did not notice that something was wrong, \u201cI happened to be coming back from the inner mountain that day when I heard an explosion. By the time I rushed over, I saw you lying on the ground, severely injured.Xiao Yulan suddenly blushed, as though she remembered something, \u201cI practice the way of cultivation, there is no need to sweat the small details. I have a need to be magnanimous, both mentally and physically.\u201dMagnanimous, both mentally and physically. Cousin Yulan, you sure are bold and unconstrained,\u00a0Xiao Chen smiled bitterly in his heart. \u201cRight, Cousin Yulan, how long was I unconscious for?\u201d\u201cFor two days already. Yesterday, the Third Elder even came to visit you. Seeing that your meridians were injured, he gave you a Jade Cloud Pill. If it were not for that, then your internal injuries would not have healed as fast,\u201d Xiao Yulan quickly said, telling him the details of the Third Elder\u2019s visit as well.The Third Elder\u2014Xiao Tian. The matters of the Xiao Clan\u2019s Seven Horn Mountain were all managed by him. With such a big commotion in the forest, it was not strange that he was aware of it.What caused Xiao Chen to be surprised was that Xiao Tian actually took out a Jade Cloud Pill to treat him. This Jade Cloud Pill was a Grade 4 pill. Within the entire Qizi County, it was impossible to find an alchemist that could refine one. Such a pill that could save one\u2019s life in an emergency was worth thousands of gold.When he has an opportunity, he would have to repay this kindness. The next time he refined medicines, he would give a bottle to him. Xiao Chen etched everything in his heart.Xiao Yulan took out a red jade pendant and asked with a few suspicions: \u201cCousin Xiao Chen, where did you get this Spirit Blood Jade from?\u201dSpirit Blood Jade, so that was the name of this red jade pendant.\u00a0He made a very quick decision and told Xiao Yulan what had happened that day, using many half truths.Aside from hiding the Heaven Ranked Martial Technique\u2014Dragon Subduing Slash, he had made no other discrepancies. He only said that he had expended a lot of energy before ending Tang He in mutual destruction. This red jade pendant was obtained from his body.When Xiao Yulan heard that this jade pendant was obtained from Tang He, her expressions changed slightly, \u201cI originally thought that this jade pendant belonged to you and so I didn\u2019t inform the Third Elder. It seems that the matter is more serious than I thought. We need to inform the Third Elder immediately.\u201dIt was just a jade pendant, was it that important?Xiao Chen\u2019s suspicions grew deeper, and then he suddenly remembered what he overheard when he had used his Spiritual Sense. He remembered Tang He mentioning something about a plan or mission. Thus, he asked: \u201cThis Spirit Blood Jade\u2026 What is it used for?\u201dXiao Yulan did not hide anything and explained to Xiao Chen the origins and usage of the Spirit Blood Jade.When speaking of the Spirit Blood Jade, one must first start by taming beasts. With a strong Spirit Beast, one would have an advantage in battle. Thus, the cultivators of the Tianwu continent had never given up on taming Spirit Beast.The way the earliest cultivators tamed Spirit Beast was similar to the method of taming normal animals. They took away young Spirit Beasts and nurtured them from young. After raising and training them, they established a relationship with the Spirit Beast, accomplishing their goals in taming them.However, Spirit Beasts were different from regular animals, after all, they had high levels of intelligence. Using this method, there was no way to successfully tame a Spirit Beast that exceeded Rank 4.It was impossible to guarantee the loyalty of Rank 4 Spirit Beasts and above. It was even quite common to see Spirit Beasts devouring their master in the middle of battle.Furthermore, this method of taming required long periods of time. If it was considered fast, it still was a few years; if long, it might have been tens of years. Aside from this, one Spirit Beast would only be able to serve one master and there would be no way to transfer it to someone else.This situation carried on until a genius-leveled character appeared and thoroughly changed everything. He was the person who established the Nushou Sect\u2014Mao Yanan.When Mao Yanan traveled around the continent, he discovered a miraculous jade. After polishing it, it was able to store Spirit Beasts within it, allowing the holder of the jade to establish a blood contract.Following that, there was further research done on it and they had managed to unravel more of its secrets, inventing all sorts of methods to allow one piece of jade to simultaneously control tens of Spirit Beasts. Furthermore, there was no restriction on the Rank of the Spirit Beast.Imagine a person who could control tens of high ranked Spirit Beast; think about the terrifying level of his battle prowess. Thus, when he established the Nushou Sect, he became the first great power of the Great Tang Nation.At this point of time, everyone found out about the secrets of the Spirit Blood Jade. However, in the Tianwu Continent, only the Great Tang Nation produced Spirit Blood Jades. Furthermore, they were pretty much all controlled by the Nushou Sect. Very few of them managed to spread to other places.It could be said that the piece of Spirit Blood Jade in Xiao Chen\u2019s hand was one of the very few that could be found within the Great Qin Nation. Its value, worth many times more than a Moonstone.\u201cDoes Cousin mean that the people of the Tang Clan intended to use this Spirit Blood Jade to tame Spirit Beasts that were about Rank 4?\u201d Xiao Chen asked after understanding the crux of the problem. However, this was not really a big issue.Xiao Yulan was able to see through the suspicions in Xiao Chen heart, \u201cThis matter is not as simple as you think. According to the arrangements set by the Three Great Clans, clans aside from the Xiao Clan can only obtain herbs and Spirit Beasts in small amounts.\u201cHowever, that arrangement also clearly stated, regardless alive or dead, Spirit Beasts that were Rank 4 and above cannot be removed from Seven Horn Mountain. This was the bottom line of our Xiao Clan, as well as the largest source of our income. Now that the Tang Clan had turned their back on this arrangement, their intentions are quite clear.\u201dTo go back on this arrangement meant that the Tang Clan was looking down on the Xiao Clan, thinking that they could do whatever they wanted. This was quite a serious matter.Once this had begun and if it was not managed well, when word gets out, the authority that the Xiao Clan had over this Seven Horn Mountain will be put to question. However, why did the Tang Clan dare to do this? Their strength was far lower than the Xiao Clan. Furthermore, they had always been very low-key. There was probably someone backing them for them to have acted this way.At this moment, a dangerous aura came from afar. Xiao Chen hurriedly sent out his Spiritual Sense; he had always been very confident in his senses.After releasing his Spiritual Sense, Xiao Chen unexpectedly discovered that the distance his Spiritual Sense could cover, was now 800 meters. However, just before he had time to rejoice, Xiao Chen frowned.Through his Spiritual Sense, he could see a group of men in clothing carrying heavy crossbows rapidly making their way over. This group of people were all Superior Grade Martial Masters and the person leading them was a Martial Grand Master.Based on their speed, they would arrive in less than a minute. Furthermore, the crossbows in their hands were not of ordinary quality. It was very possible that they were works that came from the Heavenly Craft Manor.Recollecting his Spiritual Sense, Xiao Chen urgently said: \u201cThere is a group of Martial Masters coming towards us from the east. They should arrive in less than a minute.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s quickly leave,\u201d Xiao Yulan\u2019s expression quickly changed. She did not ask Xiao Chen where he had gotten the information from and just grabbed his hands and leaped out of the window.Just when the two of them jumped out, there were whizzing sounds in the air. Countless of arrows shot towards the wooden hut. The power of the arrows was extremely strong, so strong that soon, there were countless holes in the wooden hut.However, the men in black clothing did not stop. After a while, the wooden hut collapsed with a boom. Xiao Yulan turned her head to look at the wooden hut she had lived in for many years, and her expression turned incredibly cold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instead, she took out a rescue signal from her sleeves. After a round of red fireworks were set off in the air, a second one went off, and by the third round, they had completely disappeared.Xiao Yulan quickly said to Xiao Chen, \u201cThis is the highest level of rescue signal. Soon, the Third Elder and the others will arrive.\u201dXiao Chen looked at the men in black clothing, they had discovered the fireworks and were rapidly heading towards them. He felt quite helpless in his heart. Perhaps by the time the Third Elder and the others arrived, there might only be two corpses left.If Xiao Chen was here alone, after he used Lightning Evasion, he would be able to easily leave. It was a pity that at his current state, it was impossible to bring someone with him when using it.The two of them ran unceasingly, occasionally dodging arrows that were fired at them. As a result, their speed was slowed significantly. If they could not think of a solution, they would be caught very soon.Xiao Chen nimbly somersaulted in the air, avoiding an arrow, as he urgently said: \u201cCousin Yulan, if this keeps up, they will catch up to us very soon.\u201dXiao Yulan turned her head to look at the situation behind her. The men in black were continuously jumping from tree to tree, not even stopping for a single step. These men must have been highly trained in using crossbows, as even while shooting, they did not stop moving.Extending both her arms, Xiao Yulan\u2019s body danced in midair as countless red petals fell from the sky. The fragrance of Poinsettias spread through the forest.Xiao Yulan stopped, then drew the Broken Moon Sword and restarted dancing again. Her movements were very elegant, like a quick-witted fairy. The arrows that were fired looked like they had hit an intangible barrier, all being deflected off to a side.Streams of red sword tips flew around them while \u00a0Xiao Yulan unceasingly danced in the midst of the petal-filled sky. Then, the Broken Moon Sword shot out the countless red swords into the surrounding area .Although the red sword tips looked beautiful dancing in the air, they were all laced with the poison of Poinsettias. All it took was just a touch and one would be immediately poisoned.The densely packed red sword tips almost completely filled the immediate area around Xiao Yulan\u2019s body. The entire space was pervaded with the pollen of the Poinsettias. Although the pollen was poisonous, it was incredibly bewitching.The prettier something was, the more likely it was to be dangerous. When the men in black clothing saw the red space in front of them, they sensibly stopped. Poinsettia was one of the five deadly poisons\u2014not everyone had the guts to try it.Xiao Chen, who was in front, stared blankly at Xiao Yulan dancing amidst the petals. At this moment, she was like a fairy, dancing the most alluring dance in the world, causing anyone watching to be deeply engrossed,unable to come back to their senses.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Cousin Xiao Chen.\u201dIt was unknown when Xiao Yulan stopped dancing and suddenly appeared behind Xiao Chen. Grabbing his hand, they switched direction and continued running.That direction headed towards the core area of Seven Horn Mountain. In that area, the Spirit Beasts were more ferocious than those surrounding the area. Furthermore, there were Spirit Beasts that were highly ranked. Regular Martial Disciples, or even Martial Grand Masters, would not dare to casually enter that area.Xiao Yulan had cultivated there for ten years and relying on her familiarity with the area, she was very confident that she could shake off the pursuers after they entered the inner area of Seven Horn Mountain.Coming back to his senses, Xiao Chen looked at Xiao Yulan holding his hands, \u201cCousin, actually, my wounds have healed already. I can move on my own.\u201dXiao Yulan did not answer his question and just continued to hold his hands, rushing forward. She said indifferently: \u201cYou are about to die and yet you can still afford to care about these things.\u201dIn her eyes, Xiao Chen was just an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple. At the moment, they were being chased. If she held onto him, they would be able to be faster.However, while Xiao Chen\u2019s strength looked simple on the surface, Xiao Yulan helping him along like this actually made their speed much slower than what it could have been.Xiao Chen was about to retort back, when Xiao Yulan suddenly stopped. Her gaze coldly looking in front. Under a huge tree, a man in black clothes quietly stood there.\u201cHand over the Spirit Blood Jade or die!\u201d The man in black clothes said calmly, there was no trace of emotions in his voice.The highly toxic Poinsettia may have been able to hold back those Martial Masters but this man in black clothes was a peak Superior Grade Martial Grand Master. He naturally had a way to be safe from the poisonous nature of the Poinsettia.Without even doing anything, Martial Grand Masters kept appearing around him. This caused Xiao Chen to feel very depressed.With his current strength, even if he met a Martial Master, he was confident that he would still have the abilities to battle them.However, if he ran into a peak Martial Grand Master, he could only rely on the Return of the Azure Dragon to risk it all. Though, after the lesson he received from last time, he no longer dared to rashly use this terrifying Heaven Ranked Martial Technique anymore.Xiao Yulan did not reply. Instead, the sky filled with petals once again, the Broken Moon Sword in her hands pierced unhesitatingly towards that man.\u201cSeeking death,\u201d the man in black clothes snorted. He reacted as fast as lightning and gently leaned to one side, avoiding the sword. Then, he extended out two fingers, forming them into a sword shape, and pierced in the direction of Xiao Yulans brain.Xiao Yulan stepped backwards in a rush but the man did not chase after her. Pulling his hands back, a man-eating flower shot out of his hands. The man-eating flower opened up its petals, like the huge mouth of a ferocious beast, and ruthlessly bit at the Poinsettia behind it.It turns out that the person already knew Xiao Yulan had planted a Poinsettia behind him. His earlier attack was only a feint and that was his true killing move.The man-eating flower could absorb all the pollen into its body then digest it, generating stronger poison. No wonder he was not afraid of the toxic nature of the Poinsettia. He was able to sense the Poinsettia that had stealthily appeared behind him.In the instant this happened, Xiao Yulan could not recall her Martial Spirit. Chewing sounds could be heard and the man-eating flower already heavily bit on the Poinsettia, chewing down on it.The situation was critical. When Xiao Yulan battled, she was completely surrounded by the flower petals of the Poinsettia. The toxic nature was unable to differentiate between friend or foe not even allowing Xiao Chen to get close to help.At this moment, Xiao Chen could no longer hold back. He shouted out, \u201cLightning Descends!\u201dLightning streaked across the empty sky, striking towards that man in black clothing. The man did not dare take any risk and immediately retreated backwards. Just when he stopped moving, the lightning in the sky struck towards him again.Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense had already locked down on him, abling him to determine where would he land in an instant. If he retreated backwards, the Lightning Descends could immediately strike down.However, with Xiao Chen\u2019s cultivation realm, he was only able to maintain such rapid execution of this for three times. After three times, he would have to take a break before executing it again.Taking advantage of this opportunity, Xiao Yulan immediately recalled the Poinsettia. All that was left was a broken petal, the rest had been gobbled up by the man-eating flower.Avoiding the lightning once again, the man in black clothing\u2019s eyes filled with a cold light. His gaze locked onto to Xiao Chen as he waved his hands and the malevolent man-eating flower opened up its huge mouth, heading towards Xiao Chen in a flash.Seeing the horrifying man-eating flower, Xiao Chen was struck with fear. The flower actually had sharp teeth that only carnivorous animals had. On the teeth, he could even see a cold gleam.Xiao Chen\u2019s brain worked very hard, urgently trying to think of a way to deal with it. The strongest thing that he could count on was his Azure Dragon Martial Spirit. However, his Spirit Weapon was already broken, so naturally, he would not be able to utilize the might of the Azure Dragon.Thus, all he could rely on was the Purple Thunder True Fire. It was a pity that the Purple Thunder True Fire had a very serious drawback. Although it was very persistent it had lacked penetrating power. With a barrier of Essence from a regular Martial Disciple, it could be easily defended against.How could he increase the penetrating power of the Purple Thunder True Fire?However, with the current situation at hand, he did not have too much time to think about it. The man-eating flower was approaching him. Once the man-eating flower got near, without a Spirit Weapon, he would be swallowed by it in no time, leaving nothing behind.\u201cPuchi!\u201dThe purple flamed gathered onto Xiao Chen\u2019s finger tip. When he focused his Spiritual Sense on it, Xiao Chen suddenly had a strange idea. Using the techniques of alchemy, his Spiritual Sense quickly made the Purple Thunder True Fire rotate.With every revolution, Xiao Chen\u2019s Essence would be significantly exhausted. However, the power contained in the Purple Thunder True Fire also increased significantly.With a swoosh, the flame rapidly headed to the man-eating flower.\u201cBang!\u201d when the flames collided with the man-eating flower, it resulted in an intense explosion. The huge man-eating flower turned into countless specks of lights and returned to the body of the man in black clothing.It actually caused an explosion, which was quite different from what Xiao Chen had expected. He originally thought that this improved version of the Purple Thunder True Fire would be able to pierce through the man-eating flower and defeat it, before carrying on to attack the man in black clothing.But it looked like he had to continue to deliberate this further in the future. However, the danger in front of him had passed. Xiao Chen took out the Spirit Blood Jade from the Universe Ring.\u201cThe Spirit Blood Jade is with me. If you want it, then catch me first,\u201d Xiao Chen shouted loudly at the man in black clothing. At this moment, Xiao Yulan was already injured and temporarily could not fight. He could only lure the man in black clothing away by himself.If he could lure him away by himself, then it would be easier for him the escape using the Lightning Evasion. This way, Cousin Yulan would also have the opportunity to escape.Seeing Xiao Chen\u2019s figure dashing away, the man in black clothing took a deep breath and manifested his Martial Spirit. He then quickly chased after Xiao Chen,His aim was only to obtain the Spirit Blood Jade, nothing else mattered. Since the Spirit Blood Jade was with Xiao Chen, he no longer needed to bother with Xiao Yulan.Xiao Yulan\u2019s complexation was incredibly pale as she watched Xiao Chen\u2019s figure leave. There was a complex expression on her face as the hand that held the Broken Moon Sword continued to tremble. Her mind was in complete disarray as she considered whether to chase after them or not.Naturally, she knew that Xiao Chen lured the man in black clothing away so that she could have an opportunity to escape. With the cultivation realm of that man, even if the two of them worked together, they still would not be his match. They had may as well used \u00a0one person to lure him away, saving the other person.If she chased after them now, then she would have wasted Cousin Xiao Chen\u2019s efforts. However, she believed that if she left, the severely injured Xiao Chen would not be able to escape from that man.There was no way she could as calm or at ease!At the same time, in a Xian Clan encampment within Seven Horn Mountain, the Xiao Clan Third Elder looked into the sky and saw three rounds of red fireworks suddenly blossoming in the air. He immediately frowned.\u201cPass down the order, all Xiao Clan disciples of the Martial Disciple realm and above are to gather immediately! Send someone down to inform the First Elder that the First Miss is in danger. Tell him to ask Elder Liu to come. Be quick!\u201dThe group of people under him had never seen such a grim expression on the Third Elder\u2019s face before. They knew that the situation was serious and immediately moved.In a short moment, the undercurrents of Seven Horn Mountain had surged, and there was a drastic change in their situation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Within a week, he had been chased by two Martial Grand Master, how pathetic indeed this was!However, this was different from the last time, this time, he basically had not needed to exhaust any Essence. It was actually quite easy to shake off his pursuer, he just had to continuously use the Lightning Evasion.However, now was not the time to do so. He was afraid that if he disappeared without a trace, the man would turn back and cause trouble for Xiao Yulan. In that cause, the trouble that would happen would outweigh the benefits he would gain. Thus, he could only keep running, bringing the man further into the core area of Seven Horn Mountain.Just when Xiao Chen prepared to use the Lightning Evasion, there suddenly was the sound of fighting coming from behind him. He began to have an uneasy feeling as he extended out his Spiritual Sense and immediately saw the man battling with Xiao Yulan.After his meticulous plan that he had thought out with great difficulty, he did not expect that Cousin Yulan would follow after him. Xiao Chen thought bitterly in his heart,\u00a0looks like there is no escape this time, I might as well make a stand here!A determined gleam flashed in Xiao Chen\u2019s eyes as he stopped in his tracks and quickly turned around.\u00a0Is it truly impossible to defeat a Martial Grand Master?I hope that nothing will happen to Cousin Yulan.Thinking that, Xiao Chen rushed over as quickly as he could. However, he discovered that there was blood trickling out of the corner of Xiao Yulan\u2019s mouth, looking incredibly pale as she brandished her sword and held her ground.There was an extremely impatient expression on the man\u2019s face as he knocked back Xiao Yulan once again. He was thinking of leaving as soon as he could as thoughts of the Spirit Blood Jade filled his heart. He did not wish to be tangled up in battle with Xiao Yulan.Xiao Yulan wiped off the blood from the corner of her mouth, she held the Broken Moon Sword and resolutely looked at the man in black. She did everything she could to fire out a red sword light at the man .However, the man just waved his hands and the massive man-eating flower appeared once again. It opened its huge mouth and swallowed the sword light. The martial Spirit of this man was truly Xiao Yulan\u2019s nemesis.\u201cYou came here seeking death yourself, so don\u2019t blame me for this,\u201d the man in black clothing snorted coldly. His body quickly moved forward, intending to kill her. He could already no longer tolerate spending time battling with Xiao Yulan.\u201cBoom!\u201dA flash of lightning streaked across, Xiao Chen\u2019s figure suddenly appeared in front of Xiao Yulan. The man in black clothing was startled by the lightning and Xiao Chen\u2019s sudden appearance. He quickly retreated a few steps backwards.\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, how\u2026\u2026 how did you arrive here?\u201d Xiao Yulan\u2019s face showed an extremely puzzled expression. Apparently, when Xiao Chen appeared from the lightning, it had exceeded her understanding of what could happen.Xiao Chen smiled bitterly and did not answer her question. Instead, he took out a Qi Returning Pill and passed it to her, \u201cI thought that Cousin would not come chasing after me. Although this Qi Returning Pill cannot treat your injuries, it will help you quickly recover your Essence. It should be of some help.\u201dXiao Yulan received the Qi Returning Pill that Xiao Chen passed to her. Her already puzzled face turned even more confused.\u00a0When and how did Cousin Xiao Chen obtain this strange Martial Technique?\u201cWhere did this pill come from?\u201dXiao Chen could more or less guess what Xiao Yulan was thinking but now was not the time to explain things, \u201cIf I\u2019m still alive after this, I\u2019ll give you an explanation. For now, let me borrow your Broken Moon Sword.\u201dWithout any hesitation, Xiao Yulan handed the sword over to Xiao Chen. Although she knew that Xiao Chen was definitely hiding something from her, she still deeply trusted Xiao Chen.He was willing to become bait and give up his opportunity to flee all for her. If he had secrets kept from her, it was because he had no other choice.\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, you\u2026\u2026 be careful,\u201d Xiao Yulan said out of worry when she saw Xiao Chen holding the sword and facing the man in black clothing.Xiao Chen waved his hands gently but did not turn his head back. Following that, he brandished the sword and a pure string of energy rushed into the Spirit Weapon. Very soon, the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit in his body established a mysterious connection.The Broken Moon Sword lived up to its rank as an Inferior Grade Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon. Xiao Chen could clearly feel that the power transmitted from the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit was significantly stronger than when using the Lunar Shadow Saber.Looking at Xiao Chen brandishing the Spirit Weapon, the man felt a different aura coming from Xiao Chen. This aura contained layers of might. It actually caused him to feel a faint pressure.Was this person truly just an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple?\u00a0Some doubt flashed in the eyes of the man in black clothing. However, after a moment, the stern look in his eyes returned as he said in a cold voice: \u201cI\u2019ll still say the same thing, hand over the Spirit Blood Jade and I\u2019ll leave immediately. You and the girl behind you both have great potential, there is no need to waste your lives here.\u201dGrasping firmly onto the Broken Moon Sword, Xiao Chen\u2019s expression turned calm as he smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t bother trying to persuade us anymore, I will never hand over this Spirit Blood Jade to you.\u201d\u201cNot to even mention whether you will keep your words or not, I had risked my life to obtain this Spirit Blood Jade and even destroyed a Spirit Weapon in the process. Why would I simply just hand this Spirit Blood Jade over to you?\u201dAs the man\u2019s face was covered, his expressions could not be seen. The man said in a deep voice: \u201cAs long as you are willing to hand it over, I can immediately compensate you with a Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon not inferior to the one in your hands now.\u201dWas this Spirit Blood Jade truly that useful? Was it actually worth it for him to exchange it with a Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon? Could it be that the Spirit Beast they wanted to seal was not just a Rank 5 Spirit Beast?Having some suspicion in his heart, Xiao Chen\u2019s expression did not change and he said indifferently: \u201cAllow me to analyze the situation. Under a scenario where you hold the absolute advantage, why would you offer me such a generous exchange?\u201d\u201cYou are afraid of engaging in battle with me and expending too much of your Essence. If you are to be discovered by the guards of the Xiao Clan after that, it would be difficult for even you to escape. Am I right?\u201dAfter the man in black clothing\u2019s intention was revealed, there was a gleam in his eyes and he said in a stern voice: \u201cYou refused to take the easy way and insist on threading on this difficult path. So don\u2019t blame me for this.\u201dWith a \u2018ceng\u2019 sound, the man in black drew out a two meters long sword from an unknown place. This sword could be the Profound Ranked Weapon that he intended to give Xiao Chen.[TL notes: I believe the \u2018ceng\u2019 sound is the sound of a sword being drawn from a sheath]Xiao Chen had not seen such a long sword before and, for a while, felt some surprise. With a flash of the sword, the man in black clothing took that advantage and rushed towards him.The originally graceful sword was used by the man in a very tyrannical manner, as though it was a broadsword. His techniques consisted of hacks, chops, pares, and minces. Though, it was a suitable usage of that two-meter long sword as its might was unfathomable.Xiao Chen was not familiar with the usage of long weapons, but he was even more unfamiliar with the usage of swords. He could only rely on the strong power of the Azure Dragon and the electrical glow on the sword to barely deal with the situation, but suddenly, he encountered peril.\u201cBang!\u201dAs the two swords clashed against one another, a huge repelling force came from the sword, causing Xiao Chen to be knocked backward by several meters. The Essence in his body fluctuated, indicating that he was probably severely injured, as the power contained in the long sword had devastated his body internally.The man in black clothing was not in an any better situation either. With the strong power of the Azure Dragon and the strange electrical light, when they clashed, he could feel his hands going numb.If it was not for the fact that his cultivation realm exceeded Xiao Chen\u2019s significantly, the long sword in his hands might have been knocked flying long ago.Doing his best the suppress the injuries in his body, Xiao Chen extended out a finger. A purple flame gathered on his finger and after spinning a few revolutions, it fired towards the man in black clothing.The man brandished his sword and a glow appeared. With a loud boom, the sword clashed with the flames and there was an explosion. After the explosion, the purple flames had actually not extinguished.Instead, it had spread to the body of the sword, continuing to burn. Very soon, it arrived at the handle. There was a look of shock in the man\u2019s eyes. Before the flames reached the handle of the sword, he quickly threw the sword onto the ground.Now was the time! Divine Thunder Break!Xiao Chen quickly switched the Broken Moon Sword to his left hand as the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation rapidly circulated in his body. A pure lightning attributed energy came out from his right hand.It formed a bright electrical light in the air as it shot towards the man in black clothing. Although this Divine Thunder Break was only a Superior Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique, its speed was significantly faster than the regular Profound Grade Martial Techniques. After letting go of the long sword, the man would not have the opportunity to evade it.\u201cPuchi!\u201dThe resplendent electrical light striked the body of the man, and in an instant, that body of that man lit up, crackling with electricity. He was flashing continuously, looking like a man made from electricity.Xiao Chen was very surprised, this man had used an unknown Martial Technique and turned his Essence into an armor that covered his entire body, causing the might of the Divine Thunder Break to be blocked.\u201cKill!\u201dThe man in black shouted loudly as he picked up the still burning sword. His body exploded forward, and before Xiao Chen could react, a fiery light appeared before him.Heavenly Lightning Shield!The sword shrouded in Purple Thunder True Fire mercilessly struck onto the Heavenly Lightning Shield. Due to the blocking of the Heavenly Lightning Shield, the force of that strike was severely weakened. However, Xiao Chen still ended up vomiting out some blood, showing how strong the force behind the sword was.\u201cI have never been forced to such a point before in my life by just an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple. Xiao Chen, you are the first to do so.\u201d The man in black clothing almost seemed to go berserk as he wielded the flaming sword and continuously hammered on the Heavenly Lightning Shield.\u201cBang! Bang! Bang! Bang\u2026\u2026\u201dEvery time the sword hacked down, the Essence and blood in Xiao Chen\u2019s body turned even more turbulent and Xiao Chen\u2019s complexion slowly turned paler and paler.Xiao Yulan, who had already recovered some Essence, saw the dangerous situation that Xiao Chen was in. Ignoring her injuries, she leaped forward and struck a palm strike on the body of that man.However, the man\u2019s entire body was already covered in his armor made of Essence that could even block the Divine Thunder Break. Thus, what could this palm strike do? The man in black turned around and hacked at Xiao Yulan with his sword, sending her flying.\u201cBastard!\u201d Xiao Chen shouted in pain as he threw out the Heavenly Lightning Shield, causing it to fly towards Xiao Yulan, catching her.\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, my earlier palm strike had already infused the poison of the Poinsettia into his body. All you have to do is create an open wound,\u201d Xiao Yulan weakly said as she collapsed in Xiao Chen\u2019s embrace.The man in black clothing laughed loudly, \u201cHow naive, did you think you can kill me by inflicting the Poinsettia\u2019s poison into me? Don\u2019t forget what my Martial Spirit is, there is no poison in this world that can kill me.Hearing those words, Xiao Yulan\u2019s already pale face fell even more into despair.Xiao Chen firmly grasped the sword as his heart continued to quiver.\u00a0If only I was stronger, then this situation wouldn\u2019t have happened. To think that I actually let a woman put in so much effort, even to the point of injuring herself, for me.\u201cToday, regardless of whether the Xiao Clan comes or not, both of you have to die. This is the result of your choice to make things difficult,\u201d the man in black said maniacally.\u201cIs that so?\u201dSuddenly a cold snort came from within the forest. Xiao Chen extended his Spiritual Sense but could not discover anyone. The true origin of this voice was actually more than 800 meters away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Show yourself!\u201dThe sudden voice caused the black-clothed man to be extremely agitated. He did his best to attempt to locate who had spoken. However, since even Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense could not sense him, naturally this man would not be able to do so with just his perception.\u201cIs this all the strength you have?\u201d that strange voice once again sounded out right beside that black-clothed man\u2019s ear. However, he still did could not location the origin of the voice.He\u2019s coming, Xiao Chen quietly thought. Through his Spiritual Sense, Xiao Chen spotted a grayish figure rapidly moving towards them. The figure was so fast that even Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense was not able to clearly make out his appearance.Xiao Chen hugged Xiao Yulan as he retreated backward by a few steps. He did not dare to let his guard down. It was unknown if this mysterious figure was a friend or foe.\u201cPu!\u201dBefore that person arrived, a blue flying dagger was shot out. The black-clothed man did his best to evade but his right arm was still wounded. Fresh blood started to flow out after a moment.The might of this flying dagger is truly great, it can even easily tear apart the Essence armor that he conjured up.\u00a0Xiao Chen silently thought in his heart.The black-clothed man shouted out in pain as he glared furiously in the direction where the flying dagger had come from. The massive man-eating flower appeared and started to move in the direction of his attacker.\u201cHmph! Such a weak Martial Spirit and yet you still dare to simply release it? How reckless.\u201dAfter he said this, that mysterious person finally showed himself. He headed directly to the man-eating flower but it seemed like he did not plan to do anything. Suddenly, when the man-eating flower was about two meters away from him, it exploded and turned into dust.This was different from when Xiao Chen had caused it to explode earlier. This time, the man-eating flower had truly turned into dust and vanished into the air. It did not turn into specks of lights, nor did it return to the body of the black-clothed man.The instant the man-eating flower vanished, the black-clothed man immediately vomited a mouthful of blood. His face was filled with terror as he said: \u201cYou\u2026 actually managed to destroy my Martial Spirit?!\u201d\u201cBefore your Martial Spirit had cultivated to an indestructible realm, you actually dared to show it off in front of your enemies. Serves you right.\u201d The mysterious person said coldly.The black-clothed man stood weakly on the spot and asked: \u201cAre you from the Xiao Clan?\u201dThe mysterious person said indifferently: \u201cIt can be considered so!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible, how could the Xiao Chen have a Martial Saint level expert?\u201d The black-clothed man exclaimed in disbelief.It wasn\u2019t only the black-clothed man that was shocked, even Xiao Chen and Xiao Yulan did not dare to believe that there was a Martial Saint level expert in Xiao Clan. They were both disciples of direct descent but they had never heard of this before. Since when did their clan have a Martial Saint level expert?A Martial Saint cultivator could be considered to be amongst the strongest force in Mohe City. Even within the Great Qin Nation, regardless of city, a Martial Saint cultivator would be of great influence.If a Martial Saint was willing to settle in the Xiao Chen, then there was only one possibility. This person must have broken through the bottleneck of Martial Grand Master at an advanced age. He likely had no more hope of increasing his cultivation anymore, thus he just wanted to find a quiet place to settle down.However, even if it was such a situation was like this, the two of them were still thoroughly shocked. This matter had just been concealed too deeply.\u201cElder, are you truly from my Xiao Clan?\u201d Xiao Chen asked cautiously.The mysterious man did not reply but a command medallion shot out from his sleeve and flew towards Xiao Chen. Xiao Chen quickly caught it and took a look.\u00a0Engraved on that black colored command medallion made of gold\u00a0were the words \u2018Special Consecrate\u2019 on one side and Liu Fengyin on the other.The Xiao Clan indeed had a mysterious Special Consecrate. However, not to mention his cultivation realm, most people did not even know what he looked liked because he was rarely seen.Seeing this command medallion, the identity of this person could be verified. Xiao Chen cupped his fist in respect, \u201cMany thanks to Elder Liu for helping us out.\u201dLiu Fengyin waved his hands dismissively as he maintained a calm expression, \u201cAfter receiving my pay, this is what I should do. There is no need to thank me.\u201d\u201cAside from that, you can hand over that piece of Spirit Blood Jade to me. The First Elder and Third Elder should arrive very soon. You can start making your way down the mountain.\u201d Liu Fengyin said that after he muttered something irresolutely to himself.Xiao Chen frowned slightly, he could not help but feel some anger well up in his heart. This person knew about the Spirit Blood Jade, which meant that he had already arrived long ago but had not helped them out.The first thing he asked for was the Spirit Blood Jade, Xiao Chen truly did not feel happy in his heart. Not to mention that he had yet to confirm the identity of this person, even if his identity was confirmed, he was just a Special Consecrate.This kind of Consecrate was not under the control of the Xiao Clan and had a lot of freedom. They could leave the Xiao Clan anytime he wanted, how could Xiao Chen simply hand over the Spirit Blood Jade to such a person?The most important thing was that this Spirit Blood Jade was obtained by Xiao Chen after risking his life and spending a tremendous amount of effort. In his eyes, it was something that had already belonged to him and had nothing to do with the Xiao Clan. He would not easily give it to someone else.\u201cI apologize, I can\u2019t think of any reason for me to hand over this Spirit Blood Jade to you.\u201d Xiao Chen looked at Liu Fengyin with a calm expression.Liu Fengyin\u2019s expression changed. Apparently, he had not expected Xiao Chen to reject his request. As he locked his gaze on Xiao Chen, the pressure from the aura of a Martial Saint ruthlessly exploded out. He wanted to suppress Xiao Chen using his aura.If it was a regular Inferior Grade Martial Disciple, they would not be able to endure such a pressure from a Martial Saint. This kind of pressure would force them to submit in their hearts and unwittingly agree to the requests of the person.However, unfortunately for this Martial Saint, Xiao Chen was not a regular Martial Disciple. The Azure Dragon Martial Spirit in his body was a Holy Beast that had existed since the ancient times. Its might and aura were comparable to a Martial God.Although Xiao Chen could not control this aura and take initiative in utilizing it, the Azure Dragon would still retaliate with a counterattack when it felt this pressure. It would meet the strong pressure with an even stronger pressure.Thus, Xiao Chen faced the aura without any fear. When the overflowing aura of this Martial Saint clashed with his aura, Xiao Chen managed to be in the advantage.\u201cAi!\u201d Liu Fengyin looked at Xiao Chen in astonishment. He did not expect that an insignificant Inferior Grade Martial Disciple would be able to ward off his aura.Feeling some frustration in his heart, he planned to increase the intensity of his aura to try and force Xiao Chen into submission. However, at this moment, there was the clatter of footsteps coming from the forest behind him. Liu Fengyin felt it with his perception and immediately stopped releasing his aura.Xiao Chen instantly felt relieved. When he looked towards the forest behind, he discovered the First Elder and Third Elder who led a large group of Martial Masters.When Xiao Qiang saw the incredibly pale Xiao Yulan, he immediately rushed over. After injecting strands of Essence into her to clearly inspect her injury, he released his breath in relief.\u201cElder Liu, many thanks for your assistance this time.\u201d Xiao Qiang faced Liu Fengyin and said with a respectful expression.Liu Fengyin indifferently nodded his head and did not reply. His gaze was indistinctly fixed on Xiao Chen. It seemed as though he was looking at a plaything, causing Xiao Chen to feel horror in his heart.You best not cross me, or else, even if you are a Martial Saint, you will not have a good ending.\u00a0Xiao Chen thought fiercely in his heart.Now that the troops of the Xiao Clan had arrived, there was no longer anything for Xiao Chen and Xiao Yulan to do. The two of them could be considered as rescued already. However, looking at the expressions of the First Elder and the Third Elder, Xiao Chen understood that the true danger had only just begun.The group of black-clothed men were all wiped out but they had all committed suicide by biting their tongue. After some further inspection, it was verified that these were the death sworn soldiers of the Tang Clan.With such a strong military might, they definitely did not enter Seven Horn Mountain with the intention of having fun. Everyone could feel the seriousness of the matter.Late at night, the stars filled the sky and the full moon hung high.Within his room in the encampment of the Xiao Clan at Seven Horn Mountain, Xiao Chen was cultivating unceasingly. He was extremely hardworking and determined, Xiao Chen did not wish to waste any time.After the First Elder arrived and brought everyone to the encampment, he made arrangements for the Xiao Chen and Xiao Yulan. The First Elder then went to meet with the upper echelons of the Xiao Clan to discuss this matter.Xiao Chen was not interested in these discussions. He felt apprehensive towards Liu Fengyin. He had a nagging feeling that this person did not have a benevolent nature. Thus, when he arrived at his room, he immediately started to cultivate.Sounds of light footsteps could be heard and Xiao Chen opened his eyes and stopped cultivating. Using his Spiritual Sense to scan the area, he immediately knew the identity of his visitor. Smiling in his heart, he got up and opened the door.\u201cCousin Yulan, you have come.\u201d Xiao Chen smiled gently. He had already expected that Xiao Yulan would come and visit him, thus he was not surprised.At this moment, Xiao Yulan had already changed her clothes. After spending the day recuperating, her complexation seemed a lot better. When she saw Xiao Chen suddenly opening the door, she was surprised. After that, a smile beamed on her face, \u201cCousin Xiao Chen, shall we go take a walk?\u201dWithin the large encampment, the Xiao Clan guards could be seen patrolling everywhere. Each and every one of the guards were Martial Masters, they could be said to be the elite troops of the Xiao Clan.The two of them walked to a remote area. The clear and cold moonlight shone on Xiao Yulan\u2019s face, giving her a faint look of grief. Xiao Chen just silently accompanied her without saying anything.\u201cThey will be sealing the mountains tomorrow, Cousin Xiao Chen, what are your plans?\u201d after a long period of silence, Xiao Yulan revealed a piece of shocking news.Sealing the mountains, this was the first time this had happened since Xiao Clan had started managing Seven Horn Mountain. Xiao Chen could not understand,\u00a0wasn't it just the sealing of a Rank 4 and above Spirit Beast? Is there a need to take such drastic measures?When she saw Xiao Chen\u2019s puzzled look, Xiao Yulan explained: \u201cThis matter is related to the Promise of Ten Years. As to how it is related, I am not sure either.\u201dEvery Promise of Ten Years, the Tang Clan would choose to give up. With such a movement before the Promise of Ten Years, it was hard for anyone to not be suspicious.\u201cCousin, actually, during the day, I had the opportunity to leave.\u201d Xiao Chen thought for a while before slowly enunciating. It was best for some things to be explained to her.Xiao Yulan smiled gently, looking like a fairy, \u201cI know, I had already guessed that. You don\u2019t have to explain to me.\u201d\u201cJust like you said in the past, everyone had their own secrets. Snooping around another person\u2019s secrets is not a wise thing to do.\u201dXiao Yulan stopped for a while and looked resolutely at Xiao Chen before continuing: \u201cI only know that you are my Cousin Xiao Chen, the cousin who is willing to give up his chance to flee for me. This is sufficient for me.\u201dHearing this, Xiao Chen felt extremely grateful in his heart. If it was another person came to ask him about this, he would just ignore them. However, if it was Cousin Yulan, it would put him in a difficult position.\u201cActually, I already guessed that the Tang Clan members intended to seal some Spirit Beast.\u201d After he stopped for awhile, Xiao Chen changed the subject and avoided Xiao Yulan\u2019s warm resolute gaze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 39:\u00a0Spirit Beast UproarFor the Tang Clan to be willing to pay such a large price, the Spirit Beast they wanted to seal was doubtlessly not a Rank 5 Spirit Beast. The highest ranked Spirit Beast in this mountain was only Rank 6, and that was the equivalent to a human Martial King.There existed only one Rank 6 Spirit Beast within Seven Horn Mountain, namely the king of Seven Horn Mountain\u2014Six-Tailed Spirit Fox.The Spirit Fox was a special Spirit Beast. This kind of Spirit beast could cultivate and evolve. The Two-Tailed Spirit Fox that Xiao Chen had encountered in the outskirts was the result of a Spirit Fox progressing in its cultivation.However, the conditions for the Spirit Fox to evolve were very harsh. Within this massive Seven Horn Mountain, the number of Spirit Foxes that could evolve till they were Rank 5 Spirit Beasts only numbered about a hundred. As for the Rank 6 Six-Tailed Spirit Fox, there was only a single one in the entirety of Seven Horn Mountain.This Six-Tailed Spirit Fox was the Tang Clan\u2019s target. However, what led Xiao Chen to feel strange was that the strength of the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox was similar to that of an Inferior Grade Martial King. Why was the Tang Clan so confident in dealing with it?Could it be that, like the Xiao Clan, they also had a hidden Martial Saint Expert? When he thought of this, then it was not completely impossible, but Xiao Chen kept feeling that something was amiss.Xiao Yulan smiled gently, \u201cYou are not the only person to think of this. My Grandfather, the Third Elder, and the others had thought of this too. As long as they are able to capture the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox, then it would be the same to them having acquired another Martial King expert.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox has a long lifespan. It\u00a0is sufficient enough to ensure that the position of the Tang Clan within Mohe City will not suffer any threat for the next hundred years.\u201dWhen they made the connection between this operation and the Promise of Ten Years that is to take place three months later, it was no wonder that the First Elder and the rest would choose to seal the mountain\u00a0after the Tang Clan tried to capture the Spirit Beast\u00a0from under their noses.\u201cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u201dAll of a sudden, the loud roars of Spirit Beasts emerged from within Seven Horn Mountain. Those roars were as loud as thunder, shaking even the ground. Endless stomping sounds came from the direction of the disturbance.This encampment was located between the outskirts of Seven Horn Mountain and the core area. Originally, the First Elder and the others set up base in this location for convenient entry.\u00a0That was the biggest contributing reason why they choose to set up the encampment here.At this moment, the roars of the Spirit Beasts echoed continuously in deafening fashion. It almost seemed as though a huge army was marching past, and the ground felt as though it was about to split apart at any moment.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWhy are there so many Spirit Beasts roaring?\u201d\u201cThe Spirit Beasts are in an uproar!\u201dThe originally orderly encampment turned chaotic within moments. The guards kept shouting out in panic, and there was no longer any semblance of order present.Xiao Chen immediately spread out his Spiritual Sense, moving in all directions like a ripple. He discovered that there was nothing special going on within 800 meters of him.With just a thought, he completely withdrew his Spiritual Sense and then sent it out again using another method, in the shape of a laser beam.This was a method that Xiao Chen had discovered by accident. If he sent it out like a laser beam, then his sensory range would roughly double. Its disadvantage was that it would not provide a comprehensive view of everything. In order for him to get a 360 degrees view, he would have to keep moving this line of Spiritual Sense while simultaneously expanding a lot of his mental strength.In an instant, Xiao Chen could see everything clearly within a straight line of\u00a01500\u00a0meters. This allowed him to finally get an overview of the situation. There was a large group of all sorts of Spirit Beasts currently rushing down the mountain.Rank 3 Scarlet Moon Tiger, Rank 4 Demonic Scorpion, Evil Wind Rat, and all sorts of other Spirit Beasts seemed to be under some sort of command, frantically rushing down the mountain. They would arrive at this location within five minutes.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Everyone be quiet.\u201d The First Elder had come out from the hall and shouted out when he saw the situation outside.The First Elder was, after all, the First Elder. When everyone saw him appear, a calm settled over the chaos in the camp. After a while, a Xiao Clan disciple came rushing in from outside.\u201cFirst Elder, things don\u2019t look good. Those Spirit Beast in the core area seem to have all gone crazy. They are all heading down the mountain and will arrive here soon!\u201dXiao Qiang seemed direly shocked by this. They had never experienced the Spirit Beasts on Seven Horn Mountain going collectively berserk before, after all. \u201cElder Liu, what do you think?\u201dLiu Fengyin did not look startled as he replied indifferently. \u201cThis could be a result of them making a move earlier. As for why all these Spirit Beasts have gone crazy, I do not know either.\u201dXiao Qiang muttered to himself irresolutely before telling the Third Elder: \u201cXiao Tian, bring the disciples that are below the Martial Master realm down the mountain immediately. Elder Liu and I will bring a few Martial Grand Masters to go investigate the situation.\u201d\u201cFirst Elder, what about the matter that I have discussed with you earlier? What is your decision?\u201d Liu Fenglin said, still with a nonchalant expression.He was the only one here that was able to remain this calm. As a Martial Saint, even if all of the Spirit Beasts within Seven Horn Mountain were to pile up against him, he would be able to retreat safely.\u201cRegarding the Spirit Blood Jade? I have to find out Xiao Chen\u2019s intentions first.\u201d Xiao Qiang replied. Seeing Xiao Yulan walk over, he asked, \u201cHave you seen Xiao Chen?\u201d\u201cHe left. He said that he had something to do and would go down the mountain himself first. He said that we do not have to bother about him.\u201d\u201cWhat?! He left!\u201d Liu Fenglin cried out, a look of anger flashing in his eyes.Xiao Chen had left three minutes ago because he had discovered something interesting with his Spiritual Sense. It might even be the reason for why the Spirit Beasts were in such an uproar.\u2026\u2026Within the forest in Seven Horn Mountain, there was a group of people speaking with an anxious expression on their face. Amongst them, there was a blue-clothed person who stood out; this person was that mysterious Martial Saint that Xiao Chen had met in the Thunder Emperor\u2019s cave.As for the rest, they were the disciples of Mohe City\u2019s Tang Clan. Tang Yuan was also present there, but his complexion was currently extremely pale. Right now, he was trembling with fear and holding on to an infantile Spirit Beast, daring not to even breathe deeply.\u201cSir Leng, what should we do now?\u201d The Tang Clan First Elder, Tang Feng, asked nervously. That group of Spirit Beasts was chasing them relentlessly. If they could not think of any other ideas, then aside from that blue-clothed person, the rest of them would die here.The blue-clothed person looked at the infantile Spirit Beast in Tang Yuan\u2019s embrace and said indifferently: \u201cElder Tang, I have already accomplished the matter of obtaining this Spirit Beast. Although there were some unforeseen accidents, the responsibility does not lie with me. I believe that my agreement with your Tang Clan still stands?\u201dTang Feng\u2019s face twitched as he looked furiously at Tang Yuan. When the nearby Tang Yuan felt his gaze, he immediately lowered his head.The Tang Clan had prepared many years for this Six-Tailed Spirit Fox, long before the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox had given birth.After childbirth, the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox would typically exhaust a great deal of energy and turn frail, suffering a drop in strength to the Martial Saint level. This was a rare opportunity for the Tang Clan.Coincidentally, this blue-clothed man appeared before the Tang clan and came to an agreement with him. The blue-clothed man would deal with the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox, whereas the Tang Clan would purchase a Spirit Blood Jade in an auction in the Great Tang Nation and seal it.Who would\u2019ve thought that Tang Yuan and his group would ultimately lose the Spirit Blood Jade when all the proceedings were in order and awaiting execution?.This lead Tang Feng to be very livid. After thoroughly scolding Tang Yuan, he decided to put everything on the line and deployed their clan\u2019s death-sworn soldiers to retrieve the Spirit Blood Jade.When the appointed time had arrived, the death-sworn soldiers did not return. Tang Feng guessed that they had failed and exposed everything. He could wait no longer, thus, after the blue-clothed person lured away the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox, he sent in people to covertly steal its infant.Sensing that its infant had been taken, the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox actually turned violent. Using the influence it had sown upon the other beasts throughout its time as the local hegemon like a beacon, all the Spirit Beasts in Seven Horn Mountain turned berserk, frantically chasing after the Tang Clan members.While escaping, scores of Tang Clan disciples had either perished or gotten injured. The originally large and strong group was now left with a few dozen people. Their only hope now lay with this blue-clothed person.Recollecting his thoughts, Tang Feng said urgently: \u201cSenior Leng, of course, you did not go back on your part of the agreement, the Tang Clan will definitely keep their end of the deal. However, how do we leave the mountain now?\u201dThe blue-clothed person smiled indifferently, \u201cHow timely, there is a Rank 4 Spirit Beast, three Rank 5 Spirit Beasts, and countless Rank 3 Spirit Beasts heading in this direction.\u201dHearing these words, the originally anxious Tang Clan members turned even more terrified. Along the way, they had already been risking their lives. However, their efforts were all spent in vain should they be surrounded by a large group of Spirit Beasts of such caliber.\u201cSenior Leng, What\u2026 what do you mean by this?\u201d Tang Feng trembled.The blue clothed person smiled casually, \u201cElder Tang, don't be nervous. Since I came here with you, naturally, I can guarantee that you can leave here alive. Just think, in this situation, who would be more worried than us?\u201dTang Feng thought for a moment before his eyes gleamed as he piped up joyously: \u201cYou mean\u2026 the Xiao Clan\u2026\u201d\u201cThat's right, given that such a large commotion occurred, the Xiao Clan would definitely send someone over to check. However, the Spirit Beasts have all already turned berserk. They will not be able to reason things out and will kill anyone they see. With the Xiao Clan holding them back for us, escaping would be easy.\u201d\u201cThe biggest problem now is the little Spirit Fox in Young Master Tang\u2019s arms. The Six-Tailed Spirit Fox is able to vaguely sense the position of this Spirit Fox. As long as we bring this Spirit Fox with us, then it would be difficult for us to escape this situation.\u201dLooking at the little Spirit Fox, Tang Feng felt a headache incoming. This little thing was like a bringer of death. After hearing the blue-clothed person\u2019s explanation, a sense of release overcame him as he asked: \u201cSenior Leng, do you mean for us to release this little Spirit Fox?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t release it!\u201d Before the blue-clothed person said anything,\u00a0Tang\u00a0Feng said loudly.If everything had gone accordingly, they would\u2019ve immediately added a powerful force to their roster after sealing the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox. Now that they had only obtained said fox\u2019s infant, it would take a long time for it to reach a similar stage.However, after sacrificing so many people and spending so much effort, they would have lost everything and gained nothing if they just released the little Spirit Fox.The blue-clothed person smiled gently, \u201cI do not intend to let this little Spirit Fox go. What I mean to say is that if one person is to flee with the Spirit Fox while the Xiao Clan is forced to block them for us, escape should be fairly simple for the rest of us. Time is short, Elder Tang, so make your decision quick.\u201dTang Feng thought very quickly, quickly agreeing with the thoughts of the blue-clothed person. His only issue was deciding who to send.Firstly, the blue-clothed person was ruled out. Not to mention even agreeing to it, Tang Feng could not feel assurance in handing the little Spirit Fox to him. Once he\u2019s gone, he could easily fabricate an excuse and claim he had lost it, in which none of them could do anything to him.This time, he ruled himself out as well. Luring away the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox, while it sounded simple, could easily be the end of him if he was not careful. They had already lost so many men here, and Tang Feng was now very cautious and did not want anything to happen to himself.From the looks of things, the only person he could choose was Tang Yuan, who had already committed a huge mistake. Having made up his mind, Tang Feng proceeded to dole out his order: \u201cYou lot! Follow the First Young Master and bring the little Spirit Fox down the mountain immediately. If Tang Yuan loses this little Spirit Fox\u2026 I believe I don't have to tell you how the Clan Head will deal with you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This mission had gotten to this point all because of his huge mistake.Originally, this mission was supposed to be very easy and relaxed. After he finished this mission, he would be able to leave a good impression on his father. At the same time, he would be able to pull the First Elder and Second Elder towards his side. This way, he would be able to suppress his second brother. From the looks of things, all of his plans had now gone awry.He now only hoped that he would be able to successfully bring back the little Spirit Fox. To see if he could use this merit to cover up for his mistake, to reduce his punishment to a minimum.The blue-clothed person looked strangely at the departing group of people, as though he knew long ago that Tang Feng would make such a decision. Sheathing his sword, he smiled, \u201cFirst Elder, come with me and go back the way we came from!\u201d\u201cSenior Leng, Did\u2026 did I hear that correctly? Go back the way we came from?\u201d Tang Feng said in shock.The blue-clothed man added coldly: \u201cThat Six-Tailed Spirit Fox is just a spent force; after a short period of time, it would lose all of its fighting capabilities. I do not wish to let the Xiao Clan benefit from this.\u201dTang Feng\u2019s brain seemed to have stopped working for that moment, unable to understand what the blue-clothed person sought to pull off, \u201cIf that is so, then why did you get Tang Yuan and the rest to leave?\u201dThe blue-clothed man smiled, \u201cA group of Martial Masters would not be able to make an impact. Instead, if the Xiao Clan discovers them, it would cause additional problems. They might as well take the opportunity to leave first.\u201dIn truth, the blue-clothed man had never had any intentions of letting that group of people leave alive. Carrying the infant Spirit Fox, they would very soon be apprehended by the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox. When that happened, they would have no chance of survival.This group of people was only good for one thing\u2014luring away the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox, to not let the berserk Six-Tailed Spirit-Fox come looking for the blue-clothed man himself. The berserk Six-Tailed Spirit Fox\u2019s strength was equal to that of a Martial King. The blue-clothed man did not want to be in the center of its attention. The longer that group was able to lure it away for, the better it would be for him.At this point in time, the sound of the cries of Spirit Beasts came from behind them. When the blue-clothed man took a look at the pursuers behind him, he saw that were five Rank 4 Spirit Beasts, all Purple Arm Apes.\u201cEarth Dragon Pulse!\u201dThe blue-clothed man snorted coldly. Suddenly, a ripple appeared on the ground. What looked like a long snake swimming slowly in a spiral could be seen on the ground.\u201cBoom!\u201dA huge Earth Dragon burst out of the ground with a surging force. It caused the rocks on the ground to be smashed to pieces as it roared furiously and headed towards the five Purple Arm Apes.The Five Purple Arm Apes were not able to evade in time, inadvertently struck by the technique. The forced contained in the tailed of the dragon instantly knocked them down. Following that, the head of the dragon smashed down like a whip against them, ensuring they would never get up again.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Looking at the dumbstruck Tang Feng, the blue-clothed man said indifferently.The two of them proceeded to leave silently. But little did they know, Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense had caught all of this. The change in his method of using Spiritual Sense had allowed him to virtually double his range. By coincidence, his focused sense had been pointed towards this group of people.Withdrawing his Spiritual Sense, Xiao Chen felt fear lurch in his heart. The strength of a Martial Saint was terrifying. He was able to instantly defeat five Rank 4 Spirit Beasts.After saying his goodbyes to Xiao Yulan, Xiao Chen had immediately left the encampment. He had furthermore headed towards the direction of Tang Yuan and the others and chased after them. Considering their strongest was only a Martial Master and that the majority of them had already incurred injuries, he felt safe in doing so.What Xiao Chen wanted to do now was to snatch away the infant of the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox. The descendants of the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox would be born as a Rank 6 Spirit Beast. After it grew older, there was no need for it to evolve in order for it to have six tails.There was a set of cultivation techniques for Demonic Beasts in the Compendium of Cultivation. It should be suitable for Spirit Beasts to cultivate as well. A naturally born Rank 6 Spirit Beast, in addition to the assistance from the Compendium of Cultivation, would inevitably be able to become Xiao Chen\u2019s strongest support.This is why Xiao Chen had decided on snatching away the infant Spirit Fox. Furthermore, he had the Spirit Blood Jade at his disposal. After he snatched it away, he could instantly seal it using the Spirit Blood Jade and hide the aura of the infant. He would then no longer be afraid of the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox\u2019s desire for vengeance.After Xiao Chen left the encampment, he immediately used the Gravity Spell and slowly flew up. He did not dare to fly too high as there were many flying Spirit Beasts within Seven Horn Mountain.Gravity Spell, its practicality in battle would minuscule due to the fact that it took too much time to activate, but it was useful for traveling swiftly across distances. Xiao Chen locked his Spiritual Sense onto Tang Yuan and his group as he slowly caught up.Through his Spiritual Sense, Xiao Chen was able to see that Tang Yuan and his group of people were caught up in battle with a group of Rank 4 Spirit Beasts. He could also feel a very strong aura in the distance rushing madly over. This should be the already berserk Six-Tailed Spirit Fox.After a few more minutes, the figures of Tang Yuan and his group finally appeared within Xiao Chen\u2019s vision. Xiao Chen, who was floating in the air, landed on a tree branch, observing the group of people below him.There were seven people. Aside from Tang Yuan, who was a Superior Grade Martial Disciple, the rest of them were Middle Grade or Inferior Grade Martial Masters. Surrounding them was a group of three Rank 4 Blood Wolves, each one possessing the strength of a Martial Grand Master.It was only a matter of time before these seven people would fall. Even if they could defeat this group of Blood Wolves. With the speed of the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox, it would be able to rush over soon. By then, their death would be even more miserable.Xiao Chen only had to patiently wait for an opportunity. He did not have to put himself in too much danger.\u201cFirst Young Master, you should go first. We can block them with just us.\u201d One of the seven men said.Tang Yuan had been waiting for someone to say this all along. He immediately left quickly with the infant Spirit Fox in his embrace.His opportunity was here! Xiao Chen smiled as his body moved gently through the air, quietly following him.Tang Yuan did his best to quickly run down the mountain. Looking at the infant Spirit Fox in his arms, he felt helpless and dissatisfied. If it were not for that strange person appearing out of the blue, he would not have fallen to such straits.\u201cBoom!\u201dIn that dark night, a flash of lightning suddenly streaked in front of his eyes. Tang Yuan was startled and tried to retreat as he thought,\u00a0Could it be that he is here?After that flash of light, Xiao Chen\u2019s figure slowly took shape in the dark. He looked at Tang Yuan with a spurious smile, \u201cYoung Master Tang, it has been a while.\u201dAfter clearly seeing Xiao Chen\u2019s appearance, Tang Yuan was in disbelief as he said in astonishment: \u201cIt\u2019s...you, Xiao Chen. How could it be\u2026\u201d\u201cHand over the infant of the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox.\u201d Xiao Chen ignored Tang Yuan\u2019s astonishment as he coldly said.Tang Yuan stared blankly for a while before suddenly laughing out loud, \u201cYou have hidden yourself well. All of us have failed to see through you. However, the people I hate the most are the ones who hide their strength. Like you.\u201d\u201cYou want this infant Spirit Fox? I will kill it right now and none of us will be able to get it.\u201dTang Yuan seemed to be remembering a painful memory as he maniacally raised the infant Spirit Fox high up and ruthlessly smashed it towards the ground.\u201cSou!\u201dA string of purple flames erupted from Xiao Chen\u2019s finger and spiraled for a few rounds before being fired at Tang Yuan. The purple flames instantly reached Tang Yuan\u2019s body.Tang Yuan was shocked as he pulled his hands back, placing the Spirit Fox back in his arms. He then extended his right palm and used his Essence to create a small shield.\u201cSou!\u201dThe flames easily pierced through the Essence shield in Tang Yuan\u2019s hands like a nail piercing through wood. After that, it made contact with his arm. Tang Yuan cried out miserably as his right hand quickly turned to ashes, forcing him to drop the Spirit Fox in his embrace.Xiao Chen shouted lightly and stomped his foot on the ground, thrusting himself forward. With a kick, he quickly knocked Tang Yuan flying and grabbed the Spirit Fox with his hand.\u201cDon\u2019t kill me, don\u2019t kill\u2026 me\u2026\u201dLying on the ground, Tang Yuan saw Xiao Chen\u2019s fierce expression. He immediately begged for mercy, immediately losing all the backbone he had earlier. Keeping this kind of person around would just cause trouble. Naturally, Xiao Chen would not let him off.With a flick of his finger, he fired out the Purple Thunder True Fire. In the next moment, Tang Yuan was completely surrounded by the fire. Before he could even cry out, he was already burnt to ashes.After looking at the pile of ash on the ground, Xiao Chen looked away and then looked at the infant Six-Tailed Spirit Fox in his arms.Its snow-white fur was not blemished by any dirt or dust. Its eyes were currently closed, just like a serene kitten. It looked extremely cute. However, this little guy was not aware that its mother had already turned berserk because of it.Feeling sorry for it, Xiao Chen took out the Spirit Blood Jade. He bit his finger and dripped a drop of blood onto the jade. As the blood came in contact with the jade, Xiao Chen immediately felt as though a small part of his soul left his body and entered into the Spirit Blood Jade.He felt slightly astonished in his heart. Nature was truly a great craftsman. Such a miraculous object could actually be naturally formed. Withdrawing his thoughts, he followed the method that Xiao Yulan taught him and cut a small wound on the infant Spirit Fox\u2019s body. Then he also dripped a drop of the Spirit Fox\u2019s blood on the Spirit Blood Jade.\u201cZiya!\u201dAfter feeling some pain, it woke up and struggled out of Xiao Chen\u2019s embrace. Before it managed to reach the ground, a strong suction force came from the Spirit Blood Jade and sucked the little Spirit Fox in.Xiao Chen sent a thread of Spiritual Sense into the Spirit Blood Jade. After he entered, a boundless space appeared before his eyes. A little Spirit Fox stood in that empty space, and the small cut he had made on it had already healed as it looked curiously in every direction.Withdrawing his Spiritual Sense, before he could do anything, he felt a strong aura. In the dark night, a bright light shone on Xiao Chen, causing his aura to be suppressed. He did not dare to make any movements.\u201cBang!\u201dThe light descended onto the ground and a ten-meter tall Six-Tailed Spirit Fox appeared in front of Xiao Chen. It had six tails that were twenty meters long, pointing towards the sky. Its eyes were bloodshot, staring intently at Xiao Chen.A baleful aura that filled the sky came from its body. Under this pressure, Xiao Chen found it hard to breathe. His forehead was filled with sweat as his hands continuously trembled.How was it able to come here so fast? Xiao Chen looked at the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox, his heart filled with astonishment. The arrival of this Six-Tailed Spirit Fox was very untimely.\u201cRoar!\u201dIn this critical moment, the Azure Dragon within Xiao Chen\u2019s body released a loud and long roar. The might of a Holy Beast broke out from his body, blocking the baleful aura that had essentially clogged their immediate atmosphere. Xiao Chen finally managed to regain his ability to move his body.Just as Xiao Chen was preparing to flee, the huge Six-Tailed Spirit Fox suddenly fell over. With a loud \u2018boom\u2019, it caused countless trees to be broken, sending copious amounts of dust flying into the air.\u201cHaha, this beast has finally ran out of energy. Elder Tang, you should go and deal with that kid from the Xiao Clan. Take revenge for the Young Master of your clan. I will deal with the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox.\u201d He laughed loudly.\u00a0\u00a0The blue-clothed man had follow the aura of the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox earlier and managed to chase after them.Tang Feng snorted coldly; he did not say anything as he stared at Xiao Chen. He and the blue-clothed man had just arrived when he saw Tang Yuan dying at his hands. If it was not for the blue-clothed man holding him back, he would have immediately rushed over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Essence contained within the flying dagger created a wave in the air. Its intense friction with the air caused sparks to fly.The blue-clothed person\u2019s expression did not change as he stared at the glowing flying dagger. He circulated his Essence and\u00a0a string of stones\u00a0gathered on his right hand,\u00a0pouring onto his right palm and rotating incessantly.From that whirlpool of stones, a stone shoot out and accurately struck the flying dagger. With a loud \u2018boom\u2019, the flying dagger and the stone were both shattered into pieces. Qi waves were then scattered in all directions.When he saw Liu Fenglin walk out from the darkness, there were great ripples in the blue-clothed man\u2019s heart.\u00a0Since when did Mohe City have another Martial Saint? Could the reports of the clan have been mistaken?Nonetheless, it only took a few brief moments for his heart to calm down. He had discovered that the old man in front of him was only an Inferior Grade Martial Saint. In contrast, the blue-clothed man had already been a Medial Grade Martial Saint for a long time.At the Martial Saint cultivation realm, even the difference between a grade would result in a huge disparity in strength. Unless the lower grade had better Spirit Weapons or Martial Techniques, his defeat would be just a matter of time.\u201cMight I ask who are you? Do you have designs on this Six-Tailed Spirit Fox too? Are you not aware of the concept of first come first served?\u201d after determining Liu Fenglin\u2019s cultivation realm, the blue-clothed man tone became rather blunt.Liu Fenglin smiled coldly as he said indifferently: \u201cFirst come first served? I am only aware of the concept winner takes all. I have never heard of any concept regarding the order of arrival.\u201dThis Liu Fenglin had only managed to reach the Martial Saint realm when he was over sixty years old. His talent could only be called average. He had already known long ago that he would not be able to progress his cultivation realm any further.If he wanted to raise his strength further, he could only try to dabble with other methods. This Six-Tailed Spirit Fox was a good opportunity for him. If he managed to subdue and tame it, it would immediately turn into a strong support for himself.Furthermore, based on his status in the Xiao Clan, they would definitely force Xiao Chen to hand over the Spirit Blood Jade after weighing the pros and cons. Regardless whether he was willing or not, the Xiao Clan would not offend a Martial Saint for an insignificant Inferior Grade Martial Disciple.The blue-clothed person\u2019s expression turned cold and his eyes gleamed as he smiled coldly, \u201cFor an insignificant Inferior Grade Martial Saint, you have quite a big appetite.\u201dLiu Fenglin smiled indifferently and casually pointed, \u201cLook there\u2026\u201dThe blue-clothed person looked in the direction that Liu Fenglin had pointed in and his expression changed. Tang Feng, who was originally supposed to be dealing with Xiao Chen, was currently dealing with the attacks of three of the Xiao Clan\u2019s Martial GrandMaster. As for Xiao Chen, he had been standing at the side, calmly watching the battle taking place.With three Martial Grand Masters, there was absolutely no chance of any mishaps happening. Tang Feng\u2019s defeat was only a matter of time. After the three of them finished off Tang Feng and joined forces with Liu Fenglin, the blue-clothed man would not be at an advantage even with his cultivation as a Medial Grade Martial Saint.The blue-clothed person analyzed his situation quickly. After a short moment, he made a decision in his heart. He shouted explosively and stomped his foot on the ground. Streams of rocks appeared beneath his foot.The rocks under his foot began to spin rapidly, moving like a living creature as it wrapped itself around both of his feet. The blue-clothed person\u2019s speed suddenly experienced an explosive increase. In an instant, he arrived in front of Liu Fenglin and ruthlessly kicked at him.\u201cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u201dAt this moment, there were three exploding sounds coming from behind the blue-clothed man. Three earth dragons erupted from the ground and roared furiously. They headed toward Liu Fenglin, blocking off all his paths of escape.Liu Fenglin\u2019s expressions did not seem panicked. He had already expected this person to not give up easily. He immediately guarded himself against this sudden attack.Extending out a palm, Liu Fenglin blocked the kick of the blue-clothed man. Utilizing the force of that kick, he quickly leaped back and countless flying daggers appeared around his body, rapidly spinning around him.\u201cDance of a thousand daggers!\u201dThe spinning flying daggers carried a huge force behind them and they created whistling sounds as they rotated. This force formed a tornado tens of meters tall and it clashed with the three earth dragons. The flying daggers spinning in the air caused numerous wounds on the body of the earth dragon\u2019s gray bodies.At this moment, the two of them were in a deadlock. The three earth dragon relentlessly attempted to circle around the tornado, occasionally smashing intensely against it. However, the countless flying daggers would continuously drain the energy of the earth dragons.The tornado that had suddenly appeared circled the earth dragons and caused an intense wind current. Streams of wind were blown in all directions. In the surroundings of the two Martial Saints, there was a strong gale that caused sand and stone to fly around.The First Elder led the two other Martial Grand Masters to deal with Tang Feng. This battle was extremely\u00a0relaxing\u00a0for them. However, for them to thoroughly defeat Tang Feng would still take some time. After all, they were all Martial Grand Masters. If they risked everything to battle, it would not be easy to deal with them.They cast a glance towards Liu Fenglin\u2019s and the blue-clothed man\u2019s battle, they could not help but feel worried. The two of them seemed evenly matched, it was difficult to tell who would emerge victorious.However, a perceptive person would be able to tell that Liu Fenglin was slightly inferior. Once Liu Fenglin was defeated, the three of them would not be a match for the blue-clothed person.Tang Feng obviously understood this, which was why he did everything he could and expanded his Essence, executing all sorts of Martial Techniques. All his efforts were to delay the three of them. When the blue-clothed man emerged victorious, then he would have the opportunity to survive.The current battle had entered into a strange situation. Whichever side could finish their battle first, the other side would end up losing.Under the situation of this precarious balance, everyone forgot about Xiao Chen, who was quietly standing at the side. The reason was simple, no one believed that an insignificant Inferior Grade Martial Disciple had the ability to enter a battle between Martial Grand Masters and Martial Saints.However, was the situation truly so?Looking at Tang Feng enduring bitterly, the corners of Xiao Chen\u2019s mouth curled up into a cold smile. His Spiritual Sense locked onto Tang Feng\u2019s body as the Essence in his body continually circulated as he prepared to execute\u00a0Lightning Descend.\u201cBoom!\u201dA lightning that had exhausted\u00a05%\u00a0of Xiao Chen\u2019s Essence dropped from the sky. The terrifying thunderbolt caused the dark night sky to be lit up as though it was day.In that instant the lightning struck, everyone\u2019s expression was dumbstruck. Tang Feng, who was in a bitter battle, did not notice this lightning that had suddenly appeared.That intense light faded away and the dark night sky returned to normal. That bolt of lightning which had appeared then disappeared in an instant gave everyone an ethereal feeling. However, Tang Feng\u2019s \u00a0charred and smoked body , proved that the bolt of lightning was real.\u201cDo it!\u201d The First Elder, Xiao Qiang, took the initiative and reacted to this unexpected change in situation. He smashed a palm towards Tang Feng\u2019s body as the two other men quickly made a move. They both struck another two strong blows onto Tang Feng\u2019s body.Xiao Qiang turned his head to look at the calm Xiao Chen. There was a puzzled looked in his eyes but he soon retracted his gaze, \u201cGo help!\u201dThe situation of the battle had quickly changed in their favor with Xiao Chen\u2019s help. Liu Fenglin led the three Martial Grand Masters in surrounding and attacking the blue-clothed man. The blue-clothed man looked hatefully at Tang Feng\u2019s corpse, feeling dissatisfaction in his heart.At this moment, there was no longer any hope for him to win. The blue-clothed man was a decisive person. After blocking the attacks of the four people, he immediately turned around and fled.Liu Fenglin looked at the unconscious Six-Tailed Spirit Fox on the ground, then looked at Xiao Chen, who was not far away. He faced the First Elder and said: \u201cWe should chase after him, he is currently not injured and could sneak attack us at any time.\u201dLiu Fenglin\u2019s concerns were valid. The sneak attack of a Medial Grade Martial Saint could instantly cause the three Martial Grand Masters to lose their battle capabilities. Now that they have gotten to this point, Liu Fenglin did not dare to be careless.After all, the body of the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox was very humongous. There was no possibility of Xiao Chen moving it away.\u00a0Killing it would be even more impossible for him. Furthermore, he was the only person here. Even if the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox did die by some miracle, it would be obviously be by Xiao Chen\u2019s hands because he was the only possible person who could do it.Liu Fenglin was not worried about this as he unhesitatingly led the three men to chase after the blue-clothed person. They did not expect to be able to kill him but he wanted to ensure that the blue-clothed man did not have the opportunity to attack them again.As Xiao Chen watched the four men leave, he slowly made his way to the Six-Tailed Fox that lay on the ground. Before Liu Fenglin left, his gaze was obviously full of menace and threat.Thinking of Liu Fenglin\u2019s earlier attitude, Xiao Chen felt indignant in his heart. Raising gently, he snorted: \u201cJust an Inferior Grade Martial Saint that can\u2019t progress any further. He is just a Special Consecrate of my Xiao Clan yet he does not even put me in his eyes. The moment he opened his mouth, he immediately demanded for the Spirit Blood Jade. Since you threatened me like that, I shall play along with you.\u201dCasting his gaze onto the body of the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox, Xiao Chen saw a gaping wound. There was some horrifying wound on it, even to the point where its bones could be seen in some places. This should be the moment where it is the weakest. When it fought with the blue-clothed man, it must have gotten injured. After it went berserk, it overdrafted its life force, causing its injuries to worsen.A Rank 6 Spirit Beast, equivalent to an Inferior Grade Martial King, was actually in such a state. Xiao Chen felt that it was pitiful. Even if it was an animal, the feelings a mother had for their child was really sincere and pure.Thinking of the lovely little fellow in the Spirit Blood Jade\u2026 If it were not for this little thing, this absolute king of Seven Horn Mountain would not have rampaged like that.Xiao Chen made an estimate of the size of the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox. After making the measurements, he aimed his Universe Ring at the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox on the ground and with a \u2018sou\u2019 sound, the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox was stored in the Universe Ring.The Spatial Rings of this world were not able to contain any living things. However, the Universe Ring was different. If a Spirit Beast was willing or unconscious, as long as it would be able to fit into it, there would be no problems.Liu Fenglin, who had left, did not expect that Xiao Chen would be capable of bringing the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox away using the otherworldly Universe Ring. Or else, even if he was beaten to death, he would not have allowed Xiao Chen to stay there while he left.Xiao Chen used his Spiritual Sense to investigate his surroundings. He quickly discovered that the berserk Spirit Beasts had already dispersed. This should be related to the fact that the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox had fainted.After he determined the direction where Liu Fenglin and the others had gone, Xiao Chen withdrew his Spiritual Sense. He swallowed a Qi Returning Pill and headed in the opposite direction, continuously executing the Lightning Evasion. After about ten thunderclaps, Xiao Chen was already a thousand meters away.Seven Horn Mountain was only about 3000 meters tall. Xiao Chen had stopped in the middle section of the mountain. After resting for awhile and letting his Essence recover, Xiao Chen searched for a hidden cave before he stopped moving further.He released the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox from the Universe Ring and muttered to himself, \u201cConsider this as compensation. After snatching you kid away, I can\u2019t watch you die like this.\u201d\u201cNor would I let Liu Fenglin take you away. If that happens, your fate would be even more miserable.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, the speed of the blue-clothed man was strangely fast. The rocks on his feets continuously circled his feets causing him to move extremely fast on the flat ground.Not long after the chase, he managed to escape from the group\u2019s view. Liu Fenglin could only helplessly give up the chase. So under the lead of Liu Fenglin, they quickly rushed back.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why is the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox missing?\u201d Liu Fenglin said in shock after looking at the empty ground. \u201cWhere\u2019s Xiao Chen? Where did he go to? He must have secretly taken it.\u201dThe Six-Tailed Spirit Fox was gone and Xiao Chen was missing. Liu Fenglin immediately made the connection.\u00a0Could Xiao Chen have taken away the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox?\u00a0Yet, it did not make sense to him.The Six-Tailed Spirit Fox was ten meters tall. Xiao Chen was just an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple, it was impossible for him to take it away without leaving any trace.Hearing Liu Fenglin\u2019s words, Xiao Qiang felt that it had carried an obvious tone of reproach. Anger flashed in Xiao Qiang\u2019s eyes, this Liu Fenglin was too condescending. No matter what, Xiao Chen was still the son of the Clan Head. He did not have the rights to speak about Xiao Chen in such a manner.Controlling his emotions, the First Elder carefully observed his surroundings. He discovered that there was no trace of the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox being moved. It was as though the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox had vanished into thin air.After muttering to himself for awhile, Xiao Qiang said: \u201cElder Liu, from what I can tell, the way the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox disappeared is too strange. It is too early to determine that Xiao Chen took it away.\u201dThe other two Martial Grand Masters observed their surroundings as well and had also found it strange. This situation just seemed too impossible. One of them said: \u201cCould it be that this Six-Tailed Spirit Fox recovered from its injuries and then brought Xiao Chen away?\u201d\u201cHow ridiculous! That Six-Tailed Spirit Fox was already severely injured earlier. After that, it went berserk, expending a large amount of its lifeforce. How could it recover so fast?\u201d Liu Fenglin retorted fiercely in a loud voice.\u201dXiao Qiang held his hands behind his back and carefully investigated the surrounds once again. However, he did not manage to see anymore clues. It seem like only Xiao Chen would know the reason for the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox\u2019s disappearance.After thinking for awhile, Xiao Qiang replied: \u201cThe most important thing now, is to find Xiao Chen. Regardless of the situation, he is the son of the Clan Head. If anything happened to him, we would not be able to take responsibility for it.\u201d\u201cNow that the Spirit Beast uproar has already stopped, I decided that we will seal the mountain immediately. There is no need to wait till tomorrow. If we meet any members of the Tang Clan, kill them on the spot.\u201dWith regards to this arrangement, Liu Fenglin did not have any opinions. He also did not have any ideas as to how the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox disappeared. He could only look for Xiao Chen first and then decided what to do from then on.\u2026...Putting that situation aside, in another place, at that moment... Xiao Chen was currently in a secret cave spreading the Golden Salve on the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox. This Golden Salve was given to him in the past by Xiao Yulan. He had never gotten round to using it yet. Good thing that is was not used before, so he could use it nowHe carefully spread the Golden Salve on all of its wounds and the white color medicinal powder gave off a sizzling sound on the wounds. The unconscious Six-Tailed Spirit Fox still trembling.After finishing, Xiao Chen started to send the Essence in his body into the body of the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox. A stream of warm and gentle Essence quietly healed the severely injured internal organs of the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox.Due to the fact that Xiao Chen was focused on treating the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox, he failed to notice its eyes open slightly, looking at Xiao Chen and remembering his appearance in his heart.The Essence circulated for a cycle in the body of the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox. Xiao Chen discovered that the meridians of this Spirit Beast were very suitable for the Demonic Beast cultivation method in the Compendium of Cultivation.According to the Compendium of Cultivation, any being that had spirituality could cultivate it. In the legends of ancient China, there were many demons that were quite famous.After hesitating for a while, Xiao Chen decided to teach the Spirit Fox the Mysterious Nine Heavenly Revolution Transformation that was recorded in the Compendium of Cultivation. There was very little information about Demonic beast cultivation in the Compendium of Cultivation, with only this set of Mysterious Nine Heavenly Revolution Transformation.Following the circulation method of the Mysterious Nine Heavenly Revolution Transformation, Xiao Chen controlled his Essence and made it circulate within the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox\u2019s body. After an hour, this stream of Essence had undergone one cycle of the circulation method.This way, it would leave behind a trace of this circulation method in the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox. After it woke up, it could just follow that pathway and cultivate by itself.Consider this as your compensation.\u00a0Xiao Chen thought and withdrew his Essence. This Mysterious Nine Heavenly Revolution Transformation was actually a mysterious cultivation method left behind by the legendary Demonic World.\u201cYou idiot! Still not leaving yet? This fox is about to wake up.\u201dSuddenly a clear voice appeared in that empty cave. Xiao Chen, who was deep in thought, was startled. He immediately expanded his Spiritual Sense and searched in all directions.However, aside from himself and the \u2018unconscious\u2019 Six-Tailed Spirit Fox, there was no one else. Even when focusing his Spiritual Sense into a beam, there was no one else within a thousand meters of him.A hallucination? Did not seem like it. Xiao Chen was bewildered.\u201cYou idiot! Stop searching, I am here.\u201d A somewhat illusory image of a girl slowly floated out of the Universe Ring, appearing in Xiao Chen\u2019s shocked gaze.This girl did not seem older than fourteen or fifteen years old. She was dressed in red clothes and looked very cute. However, her body had an ethereal feel to it.Xiao Chen was stunned for a long time before he reacted to it. \u201cAre you a human or a ghost? How did you come out?\u201dHearing Xiao Chen\u2019s questions, the girl became angry. However, when the angry expression appeared on that cute face, it would not caused one to sense any anger.\u201cI am neither human nor ghost. I am only a Sword Spirit. You don\u2019t have to make such a big fuss. My name is Ao Jiao.Sword Spirit?Could it be that broken sword from the Thunder Emperor\u2019s cave?\u00a0Xiao Chen suddenly recalled that when he dripped his blood onto the Universe Ring, he heard the voice of a girl. Back then, he thought that he was imagining things.Xiao Chen was about the ask her a question when the infant Spirit Fox suddenly came out of the Spirit Blood Jade and ran over to the unconscious Six-Tailed Spirit Fox. He was startled and was about to try and capture it.\u201cDon\u2019t chase it, this fellow already signed a blood pact with you. It won\u2019t run away,\u201d Ao Jiao said after she saw Xiao Chen preparing to chase after it. After she finished saying it, she flew out of the cave.Although Xiao Chen\u2019s head was full of thoughts about the young Spirit Fox, he also had many questions for this girl who appeared from the Universe Ring. Thus, he had no other choice but follow her.Outside the cave, that girl named Ao Jiao, no not a girl- to be precise, a Sword Spirit- had a grave expression on her face.\u00a0She raised her head to look at the starry sky, as though there was something that she wanted from there.Xiao Chen organized his thoughts and managed to come out with a clear question, \u201cWho exactly are you? How are you related to me? Can you help me understand?\u201dAo Jiao, who was floating in the air looking at the stars, turned her head. She did not answer Xiao Chen\u2019s question. Instead, she looked Xiao Chen up and down, as though she were determining the quality of something in a shop. Her eyes had a look of dissatisfaction.Xiao Chen, on the receiving end, felt very uncomfortable under her gaze and said impatiently: \u201cHey, brat! Stop looking at me like that. Answer my question, where in the world did you come from?\u201dAo Jiao frowned and clenched her right fist, waving it around. She said fiercely: \u201cWho are you calling brat! You trashy master! Don\u2019t think I won\u2019t throw you into a sea of skeletons to feed zombies.\u201dTrashy Master? When Xiao Chen heard this, he got found a clue. This fellow came out from his Universe Ring.The Universe Ring on him was made using the broken sword from the Thunder Emperor\u2019s cave and this fellow said earlier that it was a Sword Spirit. According to the legends of Tianwu Continent, in every divine weapon, there would be a Weapon Spirit. Sabers would have a Saber Spirit; swords would have a Sword Spirit; spears would have a Spear Spirit.A Weapon Spirit had intelligence that was on par with humans. However, they each had their own individual personalities. When a divine weapon had a Weapon Spirit, it could be said that it achieved true spirituality and its might in battle would become even greater.Looks like that broken sword in the Thunder Emperor\u2019s cave was a divine weapon. It was broken into half but due to some unknown reason, the Sword Spirit in it did not disappear.When he thought about it this way, it seemed very possible. When he forged that broken sword into the Universe Ring, turning it into a spatial treasure, he unintentionally subdued this Sword Spirit, becoming its master.Thinking of this, Xiao Chen smiled. Having a loli Sword Spirit for a servant, it was a pretty good thing. However, this character\u2019s attitude was slightly off.\u201cHey, idiot! Why are you laughing for no reason? Are you having a seizure?\u201d Ao Jian looked at Xiao Chen suddenly bursting out in laughter as she said bewilderedly.Idiot? Seizure?Xiao Chen almost vomited out blood as he said angrily: \u201cI should be your master right? Is this the attitude you show to your master?\u201dAo Jiao\u2019s mouth curled up in a cold smile, \u201cMaster? I was about to tell you. Although I do not know how you became my master while I was unconscious, with your current strength, you are not even comparable to an ant.\u201d\u201cYou can imagine, the attitude of an elephant towards an ant. That is the logic\u2026\u2026\u201dAnt? Xiao Chen felt infuriated. However, when he saw Ao Jian\u2019s expression, he could no longer feel angry. This girl was like a venomous snake. With her cute face, there was no way to be angry with her.Xiao Chen smiled bitterly, \u201cThen Miss Ao Jiao, what is your purpose in coming out? To look down on this trashy master?\u201d\u201cJust to remind you to get out quickly. The Six-Tailed Spirit Fox is close to recovering and waking up. After sealing her infant, if you don\u2019t leave, only death awaits you. If you died, I will be injured.\u201d\u201cTherefore, hurry up and become strong, you trashy master. Stop making a Sword Spirit lead a life of worry. It is very shameful.\u201dAfter Ao Jiao said that, she took one last look at the starry sky before going back into the Universe Ring. Regardless of what Xiao Chen did, she did not come out again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From her attitude, it was clear that she was not completely honest with Xiao Chen.Also, no matter how much he called out for her, she refused to come out. Xiao Chen could only suppress the confusion in his heart. At that moment, the infant Spirit Fox came running and bounding out of the cave, going back into the Spirit Blood Jade.Xiao Chen cast his gaze into the cave, sending his Spiritual Sense into it. He saw the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox trying to get up. It should be getting ready to leave the cave soon.Quickly withdrawing his Spiritual Sense, Xiao Chen used the Gravity Spell and flew away. After a long period of time, he searched for a huge tree and landed right on top of it. Sitting himself there, cross-legged, he calmed himself down.After swallowing an Essence Nurturing Pill, Xiao Chen calmly cultivated at the top of this huge tree. He had already broken through to the 2nd layer of the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation. The Purple Thunder Divine Incantation circulated in his body faster than it had ever done before. The surrounding Spiritual Energy frantically rushed into Xiao Chen\u2019s body.The thick Spiritual Energy became very dense in his body as he slowly circulated it in his meridians. After it completed a cycle, he entered into the Dantian. Under the effects of the Essence Nurturing Pill, the amount of Spiritual Energy he received after just one cycle was at least double of what most regular Martial Disciples would get.The Azure Dragon, that was surrounded by white clouds, happily absorbed the large amount of Spiritual Energy into its body. Immediately,\u00a0it was possible to see\u00a0the three white clouds surrounding it becoming even more saturated, its color turning even closer to a pure white.\u201cHu!\u201dThe Azure Dragon Martial Spirit spat out a stream of pure Essence. After that, it entered Xiao Chen\u2019s bone and muscles via the meridians, continually nourishing his body.Most regular Cultivators would focus on cultivating their Martial Spirit, using all the Spiritual Energy they had absorbed. When the Martial Spirit increased their realm and improved, it would result in an improvement in their strength.Xiao Yulan was a typical example. Due to an unceasing cultivation of her Martial Spirit, it had already reached an extremely intrepid level. The Poinsettia could create countless flower petals and toxic gas, enhancing Xiao Yulan\u2019s battle prowess in a fight.However, Xiao Chen\u2019s cultivation method was quite different. The Spiritual Energy that he absorbed would be absorbed by the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit then spat out again. It could then be used a second time to temper his own meridians, bones, blood, and muscles.He was not sure it this was due to an innate ability of the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit, however, every Martial Spirit had their own distinct abilities. Like the extreme poison of the Poinsettia or Zhang He\u2019s Clear Sky Sword, which allowed him to use Sword Qi while in the Martial Master realm.However, as for Xiao Chen\u2019s Azure Dragon Martial Spirit, he was not yet aware of what is its innate ability. With regards to the legacy of this inheritance, it could be said that the Xiao Clan had been severed from it. He could only rely on his own investigations and experiments to understand more.Focusing himself and staying on guard, Xiao Chen continued the process of circulating, absorbing, and the spitting out of Spiritual Energy and Essence. After the Spiritual Energy had circulated in his body for 49 cycles, the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit in his Dantian started to swell up.This sensation of swelling did not involve any pain. Instead, it made one feel excited. Xiao Chen felt joy in his heart; this was a sign that he was about to breakthrough.Xiao Chen originally had good foundations. During the past few days, he had been using the Essence Nurturing Pill to assist in his cultivation. In addition to having continuous large scale battles, it was natural that he would advance to the Medial Grade of the Martial Disciple realm.\u201cBoom!\u201dThat swelling feeling suddenly turned into an explosion. The Dantian in his body was in chaos. Spiritual Energy diffused everywhere like fog, leading Xiao Chen to carefully sort through the diffused Spiritual Energy.After a short moment, the situation of the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit became clear. The white clouds that were floating around the Azure dragon had turned from three to five. Xiao Chen could feel an obvious increase in his capacity of Essence.Suppressing the joy he felt in his heart, Xiao Chen continued to circulate the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation, consolidating his newly achieved cultivation realm. The Azure Dragon Martial Spirit also continued to spit out Essence, nourishing Xiao Chen\u2019s body.The next time Xiao Chen opened his eyes, the sky was already slightly bright. Dew pervaded the valley he was in, causing Xiao Chen to feel very refreshed. He took a deep breath, feeling refreshed and relaxed.He gently jumped down from the tree in a stable manner before sending out his Spiritual Sense. He could feel that the distance he was able to sense had increased significantly once again.Before doing anything further, Xiao Chen realized that he would have to hurry back soon. When Liu Fenglin returned to find that both he and the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox disappeared, he would have been very suspicious. The longer he stayed missing, the harder it would be to explain himself.Although he had to go back quickly, Xiao Chen did not feel too anxious about it. He cast out his Spiritual Sense along the way, letting the green sphere in his sea of consciousness instantly locate any hidden medicinal herbs.Xiao Chen had time and with such an opportunity, he would naturally not give up on picking these medicinal herbs.Medicinal Herbs could be classified into nine grades, with one being the lowest and nine, the highest. Anything above grade four was considered as superior quality medicinal herbs. These medicinal herbs would be worth thousands of gold anywhere.Grade six medicinal herbs and above were considered as top quality while grade eight and grade nine medicinal herbs were considered as peak quality.However, there were no medicinal herbs above grade six in this Seven Horn Mountain. The main reason being that the Spiritual Energy in the mountain was not sufficient; there were no prime Spirit Veins around. Even the Red Nascent Fruit he obtained was just a grade six medicinal herb.Along the way, every herb he went past, as long as it was a grade two and above, he would store it in his Universe Ring. After two hours, he had already amassed a large pile of medicinal herbs in his Universe Ring.With such a big harvest, it was already similar to a full day of spoils from a person who came specially to search for medicinal herbs.\u201cHow lucky, I actually found the grade five Earth\u00a0Tuckahoe.\u201d Xiao Chen in his heart as he carefully picked it and placed in into the Universe Ring?Just as he was about to arrive at the Xiao Clan encampment, He unexpectedly found the grade five medicinal herb.The grade five Earth\u00a0Tuckahoe\u00a0was of the cold attribute. Its medicinal properties were stable. It could be used in many pills as a supporting ingredient, raising the success rate of refining. When refining them individually, he could even cure poisons and improve blood circulation.Raising his head to take a look, the Xiao Clan encampment was already right in front of his eyes. Xiao Chen stopped picked herbs and adjusted his mental state before slowly heading into the encampment.The guards at the front of the encampment stared blankly for a moment before bursting into a joyful expression when they saw Xiao Chen suddenly appear. They quickly rushed over and said: \u201cSecond Young Master, you finally came back. The First Elder and the others had dispatched many people to search for you yesterday.\u201dThe First Elder dispatched many people just to search for me?Looks like he was going to have to spend some effort in explaining himself. He had to think of a good excuse.After asking around for the location of the First Elder, he headed to the great hall. Sending out his Spiritual Sense, Xiao Chen quickly saw Liu Fenglin and some of the others in the great hall. It seemed that the complexation of the First Elder, Third Elder, Liu Fenglin, and the others were not very good. It looked like the situation that occurred the previous night had caused them to worry.Xiao Chen was also surprised to see Xiao Yulan standing in the corner, her face full of worry.\u201cFirst Elder, has the Second Young Master been found yet?\u201d Liu Fenglin had a sullen expression as he said in a bland manner.Xiao Qiang was starting to get annoyed. The men he sent out had search for an entire night but they did not manage to find any trace of Xiao Chen, but hearing Liu Fenglin\u2019s tone, he felt very displeased.However, Liu Fenglin was the Xiao Clan\u2019s only Martial Saint. They still required him for many things. Thus, Xiao Qiang did not dare to vent his anger on him. He suppressed the anger in his heart as he said: \u201cThere is still no news. The men that I sent reported that they were no obvious traces at all.\u201dThough it would have been weird if they managed to find any trace. Xiao Chen\u2019s Gravity Spell allowed him to fly through the air so how could there be any traces of him on the ground?With this as an answer, Liu Fengling was not surprised. After all, the situation last night was indeed too strange. The severely injured Six-Tailed Spirit Fox actually disappeared together with Xiao Chen. Furthermore, they did not leave any trace behind.When Xiao Yulan heard this, her expression turned even more worried. But in the instant she raised her head, she suddenly saw Xiao Chen standing outside the door smiling.Xiao Yulan thought that she was seeing things and rubbed her eyes before she could believe that what she was seeing was real. She said happily: \u201cCousin Xiao Chen, you\u2019ve returned.\u201dWhen everyone in the great hall heard this, they immediately looked towards the door. Only to see Xiao Chen slowly walking in, appearing to be unharmed.\u201cXiao Chen, where is the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox? Where did you bring it?\u201d Seeing Xiao Chen, Liu Fenglin immediately shouted.Xiao Qiang frowned slightly before slowly saying: \u201cXiao Chen, take your time to tell us. What exactly happened last night? Where did the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox go?\u201dXiao Chen had already thought of an answer long ago. He smiled as he said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure. After you all left, I felt that I was about to make a breakthrough so I went to find a place to cultivate. As for what happened after, I had just found out myself.\u201d\u201cBreakthrough?\u201dEveryone just discovered that Xiao Chen already broke through from Inferior Grade Martial Disciple to Medial Grade Martial Disciple. They felt astonished in their hearts. The speed of Xiao Chen\u2019s cultivation was too fast.He had only condensed his Martial Spirit just a month back. Now, he is already a Medial Grade Martial Disciple. This speed was comparable to those geniuses of the big clans.Xiao Qiang felt very joyful. With Xiao Chen\u2019s rate of advancement, the chances of success would be greater in the Promise of Ten Years that would occur three months later. \u201cCongratulations, Elder Liu, are you satisfied with this answer?\u201d Xiao Qiang said as he smiled.Liu Fenglin snorted coldly, \u201cI don\u2019t care about your breakthrough. Hand over the Spirit Blood Jade.\u201dXiao Chen smiled indifferently, confidently took a seat, and took a sip of tea. He then threw the Spirit Blood Jade onto the table. Liu Fenglin joyfully stretched his hands out to take it.Xiao Chen\u2019s mouth curled up in a cold smile as he said in an unhurried manner: \u201cElder Liu, I have already used this Spirit Blood Jade to seal the infant Spirit Fox. You can have it if you want. However, I believe you will not be able to live long enough to see the Spirit Fox grow up.\u201dLiu Fenglin\u2019s expression changed as he released his aura. He shouted in anger, \u201cInsolent junior! Are you seeking death?\u201dThe aura of a Martial Saint as well as Liu Fenglin's anger ruthlessly pressed down on Xiao Chen. The air around them seemed to turn thick and everyone found it harder to breathe.Xiao Chen was still not afraid. This was not the first time he encountered the aura of a Martial Saint. The slight power that came from the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit easily blocked this surging aura.With only a single thought, the infant Spirit Fox in the Spirit Blood Jade jumped out. Although this little fellow did not have any abilities at the moment, it was still the descendant of the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox. It being a naturally born Rank 6 Spirit Beast was not afraid of this aura.It jumped gently into Xiao Chen\u2019s embrace. Xiao Chen gently patted the pure white fur of the infant Spirit Fox as he said: \u201cSee, Elder Liu, I did not lie to you, right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 44:\u00a0Demonic Beast ForestWhen Xiao Qiang noticed that something was not right with the mood between the two, he hurriedly said: \u201cXiao Chen, watch your attitude. Since you have already obtained the infant Spirit Fox, why are you still not apologizing to Elder Lie.\u201dOn the surface, he seemed to be reprimanding Xiao Chen. However, what he really meant was that he acknowledged that Xiao Chen had obtained the Spirit Blood Jade and was providing a way out of this embarrassing situation for Liu Fenglin.With Xiao Chen\u2019s intelligence, how could he not understand what the First Elder meant? He placed the Spirit Fox in his embrace down on the table, cupped his hands and smiled, \u201cElder Liu, I was rude and did not know what was good for me earlier. I have offended you, I apologize for that.\u201dLiu Fenglin snorted coldly. He withdrew his aura and did not say anything else. There was no change in his expression, but it was obvious that he was still extremely displeased.\u201cElder Liu, this is a Medial Grade Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon. I noticed that you weren\u2019t using a weapon that seemed suitable for you. Please bear with this.\u201d Xiao Qing took out that huge sword that he had obtained from the Tang Clan members from his Spatial Ring.Liu Fenglin looked coldly at the Medial Grade Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon but did not accept it. After losing the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox, he could not accept this reward that differed so much from his initial expectation.\u201cUncle, this Profound Grade Spirit Weapon did not seem to catch Senior Liu\u2019s eyes. Coincidentally, this nephew\u2019s Spirit Weapon was destroyed earlier. If Senior Liu does not want it, can I have it?\u201d Xiao Chen saw that Liu Fenglin was unwilling to accept it, so he said some half-truths.Although Liu Fenglin was furious, he did not act on his anger this time. He got up and left. Without doing anything, the huge sword in Xiao Qiang\u2019s hand flew towards him automatically.Xiao Chen felt that it was a pity in his heart. It was, after all, a Medial Grade Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon. It could be said to be the peak Spirit Weapon within Mohe City already.When Xiao Qiang finally saw that Liu Fenglin accepted the huge sword, he heaved a sigh of relief. He then turned around to lecture Xiao Chen: \u201cXiao Chen, do not be this rude to Elder Liu again in the future. He is of\u00a0the same generation as your grandfather. You have to maintain basic etiquette.\u201dXiao Chen quietly disapproved of this. This Liu Fenglin used his superior strength to try to snatch away something of the younger generation. He did not have any good impressions of him.Seeing Xiao Chen remain silent, Xiao Qiang understood what he was thinking in his heart. He explained: \u201cAlthough Elder Liu had gone overboard in some areas, I can guarantee that he would not do anything that would go against the Xiao Clan\u2019s interest.\u201dXiao Chen did not wish to linger any further on this issue and just simply said a few half-hearted words to please the First Elder. He then turned his head around to find that Xiao Yulan was carrying the infant Spirit Fox and playing with it.This had amused him. It seemed that regardless of whichever world he was in, his original world or here, it appeared that girls were still weak to cute things.The First Elder was also quite interested in the infant Spirit Fox. After all, it was a Rank 6 Spirit Beast. When it grew up, it would be a huge support to the Xiao Clan.The topic of discussion started to turn towards the infant Six-Tailed Spirit Fox and how he had managed to obtain it. Xiao Chen did not hide it from them and told the two of them about the matter of him killing Tang Yuan.When Xiao Yulan heard this, her expressions did not change. In her eyes, it was not a pity that such a person was dead. If he had to be dead, then so be it. However, when Xiao Qiang heard about Tang Yuan, there were some changes in his expressions, as though he was thinking.When Xiao Chen saw Xiao Qiang\u2019s expression change, he felt slightly puzzled and was about to ask something when a Xiao Clan disciple rushed into the great hall. In his hands was a letter, which he passed to Xiao Qiang anxiously.\u201cFirst Elder, this is an urgent letter sent by the Second Elder.\u201dA letter from the Second Elder?A look of confusion flashed in Xiao Qiang\u2019s eyes. Why did the Second Elder send a letter at this moment? The Second Elder frequently resided at the Qizi County Lord\u2019s residence working for the County lord. He was one of the County Lord\u2019s favorites.Speaking of his prestige in the Xiao Clan, the Second Elder held even more prestige than the First Elder, Xiao Qiang, did. This was because the biggest backer of the Xiao Clan was the Qizi County Lord, and the only person that was able to influence him was the Second Elder.Xiao Qiang quickly opened the letter and read it. After seeing the contents on it, his expression turned grave, then evolved into one that contained a mingled hope and fear.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What is written in the letter?\u201d Xiao Yulan asked out of worry when she saw\u00a0Xiao Qiang\u00a0frown, placing down the Spirit Fox.Xiao Chen also looked at Xiao Qiang bewilderedly. He did not know what was written on the letter to cause the First Elder\u2019s expression to turn so grave. Even when they sealed the mountain, he did not have such an expression.Xiao Qiang\u00a0put away\u00a0the letter properly as he said in a sullen voice: \u201cThe Trial of Gloomy Forest will be brought forward to a closer date. This is news that was obtained directly from the County Lord. It will be spread to Mohe City in a few days.\u201dWhen Xiao Chen heard this, his heart thumped loudly. The Trial of Gloomy Forest. Based on the memories of the original inhabitant of this body, he roughly knew what it was.Gloomy Forest was a forest of Demonic Beasts in Qizi County. There was a spatial tear linking the Demonic World to the Tianwu Continent. The Demonic Qi that came from the tear had corrupted the Spirit Beasts and trees in the forest.Under the corruption of the Demonic Qi, those Spirit Beasts then turned into terrifying Demonic Beasts. After turning into Demonic Beasts, the spirituality they had vanished, leaving behind a desire for slaughter and a tyrannical personality.Their strength had also become more formidable. A Rank 2 Demonic Beast was equivalent to a Rank 3 Spirit Beast. Furthermore, it would be in a berserk state, behaving in an extremely violent manner.There were also some trees in the forest that had mutated after being corrupted. They turned into terrifying tree spirits, man-eating flowers, etc...After the Demonic Calamity, many spatial tears appeared on Tianwu Continent. The larger spatial tears were sealed by seniors from Tri-Holy Grounds, preventing anything from entering or exiting.However, there were too many spatial tears like this in the Tianwu Continent. It was not possible for the people from Tri-Holy Grounds to seal them all. Thus, the smaller spatial tears remained.As long as nothing major happened as a result of those small spatial tears, Tri-Holy Grounds would not send anyone to seal them.The spatial tear in Gloomy Forest was one of those small spatial tears. The Demonic Qi would only be diffused in the forest and not leave it.As long as regular people do not go into the forest, there would be no danger. However, if they just left it alone, once the Demonic Beasts increased to a certain amount, they would start to wander out to the forest.Thus, every nation in the Tianwu Continent would send people to monitor the demonic forests. Once they discovered any abnormalities, they would send strong cultivators to clean up the Demonic Beast.Based on past experience, when cleaning up Demonic Beasts, the powers in the surrounding cities would send the younger disciples of their clan to train in the outskirts of the demonic forests.The environment of those demonic forests were very vile and the Demonic Beasts, incredibly fierce. However, there usually would not be any strong Demonic Beasts appearing in the outskirts, so for those young cultivators, it was a good chance to gain experience.During the events, every clan would compete against each other. It could be said to be a test of the big clans. If the results of the Xiao Clan were poor, then news of that would travel quickly to the whole of Mohe City.This would deal a great blow to the Xiao Clan\u2019s reputation. The most serious thing was that the Qizi County Lord and the surrounding City Lords would also show up there.Being the strongest power in Mohe City, they could not afford to have a bad result. If they could not obtain first place, it would only give those people a bad impression.This was the reason for Xiao Qiang\u2019s expression of mingled hope and fear. If they did well this time, it will bolster the morale of the Xiao Clan before the Promise of Ten Years. However, if they failed, it would cast a shadow in their hearts.Xiao Chen stopped this train of thought. He did not feel afraid at all, as he asked with some anticipation: \u201cWhen will the trial start?\u201d\u201cThe news we got from the County Lord said seven days later. This news will probably arrive in Mohe City two days later. You two, pack your things, let\u2019s leave the mountain quickly.\u201d\u201cThe two of you will participate in this trial. The environment of the demonic forest is very vile. I have to hurry back to make some preparations,\u201d Xiao Qiang said, looking at the two of them.Although Xiao Chen was just a Medial Grade Martial Disciple, when he was an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple, he could defeat the Superior Grade Martial Disciple Xiao Jian. Now that he advanced to Medial Grade Martial Disciple, his strength naturally would have risen.Due to the fact that Xiao Yulan condensed her Martial Spirit at the age of five, she had already become a Medial Grade Martial Disciple long ago. Within the younger generation of Mohe City, she could be considered a peak existence.Whether the Xiao Clan could obtain a good result this time would strongly depend on the performance of these two. Xiao Qiang saw that their eyes were full of anticipation.\u201cWhat about the matter of the Tang Clan coming to Seven Horn Mountain to cause trouble? How are we going to settle this debt?\u201d Xiao Yulan bore a grudge against them for injuring Xiao Chen and destroying her wooden hut.From the sound of Xiao Qiang\u2019s words, it was obvious that he intended to forget about this matter, focusing on the Trial of Gloomy Forest. Xiao Yulan felt some dissatisfaction.Xiao Qiang said: \u201cThe Third Elder already sent people to the Tang Clan. Now that there are more urgent matters, it is best we don\u2019t break out into open hostility with the Tang Clan. Yulan, don't mention this matter anymore.\u201dXiao yulan pouted her mouth and did not say anything more. However, she was still upset with Xiao Qiang\u2019s words.Xiao Chen approved of the First Elder\u2019s words in his heart.\u00a0From the time the blue-clothed person appeared in Seven Horn Mountain and worked with the Zhang Clan to this matter of the Tang Clan going back on the agreement, trying to capture the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox, the current situation did not look good for the Xiao Clan.Furthermore, there was that mysterious girl Feng Feixue. Linking everything together, the small Mohe City did not seem to be as peaceful as it looked on the surface.Thus, he had never thought of immediately going to the Tang Clan to seek revenge. Firstly, his strength was insufficient. Without the assistance of the Xiao Clan, it would just be a wishful hope if he wanted to even shake the Zhang Clan.Secondly, the situation with the Tang Clan was that although he had been forced into a corner a few times, in the end, he did not lose anything. Furthermore, he even caused their operation to fail.However, the losses of the Tang Clan this time were great. Two of their elders and the First Young Master of the Tang Clan died. The precious Spirit Blood Jade also ended up on Xiao Chen\u2019s hands. Their meticulously planned operation was a thorough failure.In the past, these two clans had just minded their own business. Now, they were breaking into open hostility. However, as the situation now was not good, the two clans would probably control themselves and not take any rash actions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45:\u00a0Vixen?Although Xiao Yulan felt dissatisfied, she was not a person who would make a fuss without reason. Since she saw that Xiao Qiang was quite firm on his decision, she did not say anything else.After the three of them had lunch, Xiao Chen declined to go down the mountain with them. He made up an excuse saying that he had just advanced to Medial Grade Martial Disciple and the energies in his body was not stable yet. He stated that he needed some time to stabilize it.When most cultivators advanced, they would always spend some time to consolidate their cultivation. This was not a strange matter. Thus, Xiao Qiang did not push for Xiao Chen to follow them. Instead, he told Xiao Chen to rush back before it was dark.Actually, Xiao Chen did not need to consolidate his cultivation. When he had advanced to Medial Grade Martial Disciple, it was a an incomparably smooth affair, the conditions were perfect. He did not have to forcibly breakthrough. Thus, there was no need for him to stabilize his cultivation.The reason why he did not go down the mountain with Xiao Yulan was so that he could pick up some more herbs on the way down. Since he had come to Seven Horn Mountain, Xiao Chen naturally did not want to go down without making more harvests.He waiting until Xiao Yulan and Xiao Qiang were far away before he left as well, roaming around the mountain. With his Spiritual Sense being utilized to its full extent, it was impossible for any herbs to escape his notice.Due to the activities of the Tang Clan, the mountain had already been sealed the day before. At this moment, there were very few people who were left on the mountain. Even the areas where there were usually more people were left desolated.Thus, Xiao Chen could peacefully use his Lightning Evasion. When he discovered any good medicinal herbs, he would immediately\u00a0rush over. If it grew on the cliffside, then he would use the Gravity Spell to fly over.With his abilities, as long as he could sense the herb, he could pick it. However, Xiao Chen still followed the etiquette of picking herbs.He did not pick herbs below grade two, herbs that were immature, herbs that had not reached the age requirement, or seedlings. These were the principles a herb gatherer would have to follow.If he simply picked them as he wished, it could cause certain herbs to become extinct. Within three years, the whole Seven Horn Mountain would be devoid of herbs, turning into a dead mountain.By the time the sun finally set, Xiao Chen\u2019s Universe Ring was already full of all sorts of herbs. Ten-year-old Grade 4 Snow Ginseng, twenty-year-old Grade 3 Wind Spirit Grass, twenty-year-old Eight-Horned Lotus\u2026Xiao Chen grinned in satisfaction and laughed. With the effects of his Spiritual Sense, his Lightning Evasion, and Gravity Spell, his harvests today were already equivalent to half a year\u2019s worth of harvest of a regular person.Furthermore, he had also found some rare and precious herbs. Without this Spiritual Sense, regular people would not be able to find them. This was a great advantage for Xiao Chen.\u201cIt's time to go down the mountain, or else I\u2019m going to have to spend the night here.\u201d Xiao Chen muttered to himself.\u2026On the way back to the Xiao Residence, he did not meet any unexpected incidents. When he got arrived at the entrance of his courtyard, Xiao Chen had a sense of returning home.He could not help but smile bitterly.\u00a0Do I really have a home in this world?\u201cSecond Young Master, are you back?\u201dXiao Chen had just stepped through the entrance when he heard Bao`er\u2019s joyful voice. It was currently almost dusk and Bao`er was in the yard sweeping the leaves.When she saw that Xiao Chen had come back, She quickly stopped her duties and ran over. Her face was full of irrepressible joy.Xiao Chen felt warm in his heart. He smiled gently, \u201cEn, I have returned. How have you been?\u201dBao`er felt very happy as she started to tell Xiao Chen about everything that had happened in the past few days. She literally told him everything, even the small details of her daily life.Although Xiao Chen was not too interested, he did not stop Bao`er. His days in the mountain had been too lonely and quiet, now that there was someone chattering to him, he actually took pleasure in it.\u201cThat right, Young Master, you must be hungry. I\u2019ll go make you a bowl of fish porridge.\u201d Bao`er seemed to have thought of something before she quickly took her leave and headed to the kitchen.Although the effects of the Fasting Pill was not over yet and Xiao Chen was not hungry, he still looked forward to Bao`er\u2019s cooking. He had not eaten much for quite awhile.Returning to his own room, Xiao Chen emptied out the medicinal herbs from his Universe Ring. He took everything out and prepared to sort them out.\u201cHua!\u2019A large pile of medicinal herbs appeared out of nowhere and the room was almost completely occupied by them. With so many medicinal herbs, it would not be easy to sort them out. This was a headache caused by a blessing.However, no matter how difficult it was, he still had to do it. Or else, it will be very problematic when he needed to use these herbs in future. Xiao Chen first started by sorting them by their attributes. All the herbs were then split into five different groups.The five groups were, nourishing Qi and blood, wound healing, nourishing the body, assisting advancement in cultivation, and those\u00a0with no outstanding attributes.After this, he further categorized these herbs into sub-categories. After he took out the herbs that he needed, he set aside some space within the Universe Ring and placed the arranged herbs there.After he was done with all of this, Xiao Chen was full of sweat. At this moment, there was the sound of footsteps coming from outside his door. With just a thought, Xiao Chen quickly sent out his Spiritual Sense.If someone discovered that he had so many medicinal herbs, he would not be able to explain himself. After checking with his Spiritual Sense, he relaxed when he discovered that it was Bao`er bringing along the fish porridge.When Bao`er came in and saw all the herbs, she understood what Xiao Chen was doing and knew that she should not stay and disturb him. She smiled gently and placed the fish porridge on the table before leaving.After sending off Bao`er, Xiao Chen was immediately attracted by the scent of the fish porridge on the table. He immediately picked up the bowl and started eating with gusto.\u201cPlop!\u201dThe infant Six-Tailed Spirit Fox in the Spirit Blood Jade suddenly jumped out. It looked at Xiao Chen, who was enjoying his food, in a pitiable manner as it continuously wagged its tail. Its eyes seemed to mist up, looking even more pitiable.Ever since he had signed the blood contract with this infant Spirit Fox, it had not eaten anything yet. Xiao Chen had only taken care of himself by eating the Fasting Pill\u00a0and had completely forgotten about the Spirit Fox.This little thing must have been very famished. Xiao Chen smiled embarrassedly as he pushed the bowl in front of the infant Spirit Fox, \u201cAre you hungry? Here, you can have this.\u201dThe little fellow stuck out its tongue and licked the bowl a couple of times before it stopped moving. It then looked up at Xiao Chen in that pitiable manner once again. The meaning in its eyes was obvious\u2014this was not suitable for it to eat.Xiao Chen could not help but feel anxious. He had no knowledge about what to feed Spirit Beasts. At this point of time, he did not know what to do.What if this little fellow died of hunger? What was he going to do then?\u00a0He would have committed a huge miscalculation if that happened. Feeling anxious, Xiao Chen immediately thought of the worst case scenario.\u201cIdiot!\u201dXiao Chen was unclear on when Ao Jiao appeared behind him but when he saw her, he felt some hope. As for her calling him an idiot, he would pretend that he had not heard it.\u201cSister Ao Jiao, what does this Spirit Fox eat? Do you know?\u201d\u201cYou idiot, this little fellow is merely a month old. Of course, it drinks milk. What did you think it would eat? Usually, when people make a blood contract, they would wait till it is three months old first before making it. You actually did it even before it turned a month old.So, there was such a practice,\u00a0Xiao Chen thought in his heart. However, the situation then was very urgent and he did not have any other options. If he did not seal it with the Spirit Blood Jade, the Spirit Blood Jade definitely would have definitely been snatched away by Liu Fenglin.Xiao Chen\u2019s gaze suddenly shifted to Ao Jiao\u2019s chest unconsciously. Although she was a Sword Spirit, she seemed to have an ample bosom. Was it possible for her to...Damn it! What was I thinking of?When she felt Xiao Chen\u2019s gaze, Ao Jiao retorted angrily: \u201cIdiot! You are such a degenerate! What are you looking at?\u201dXiao Chen blushed as he said embarrassedly: \u201cHabit, a pure habit. Wait no! Not a habit! I did not pay attention! You got that?\u201dAo Jiao could not be bothered about him as she floated over. She carried the pitiable Spirit Foxed into her embrace and placed her right forefinger into the mouth of the Spirit Fox.\u201cChi Chi!\u201dA stream of pure energy gathered onto Ao Jiao\u2019s forefinger, giving off a white glow. Finally, this energy actually condensed into a milky white liquid.The little Spirit Fox seemed\u00a0to feel that this was the best thing it had eaten in the world as it closed its eyes and keep sucking with gusto.\u00a0Its expression was that of satisfaction.How was this possible...Xiao Chen looked incredulously at what was happening in front of him. He was not foolish enough to question what was that milky white liquid, it was clearly formed by the energy of heaven and earth.If Ao Jiao was willing, this pure energy could immediately turn into an overwhelming Qi that could destroy everything in sight.For a cultivator like Xiao Chen, If he was blasted with such a Qi, before the overwhelming Qi got near, he would already be ripped apart by its fluctuations. He would not be able to defend against it at all.Such a strength would belong to someone who was at least in the Martial Monarch realm. No wonder Ao Jiao would say such demeaning things to Xiao Chen. A Martial Monarch cultivator was a cultivator that would be able to suppress the entire nation.To be able to suppress the nation with the strength of one person. This was the level of such an expert.In the Great Qin Nation, there were three provinces, nine prefectures, and seventy-two counties. Furthermore, there were tens of thousands of kilometers of mountains and wilderness. On the surface, there were only ten of such characters. Could this young girl in front of him be one of these characters?[TL notes: The author seems to be forgetting stuff, he previously said nine prefectures and thirty-six counties]Was she really just an insignificant Sword Spirit?After a while, that milky white glow faded away. Ao Jiao withdrew her finger and staggered in the air. She seemed to be weak but the expression on her face was gratified.\u201cHey, Sister Ao Jiao. Are you alright?\u201d Xiao Chen noticed that she seemed weak, so he asked in worry.The infant Spirit Fox did not seem to have eaten much of the milky white liquid. But actually, it contains a boundless Spiritual Energy. If regular cultivators ate it, it could even raise their cultivation by a realm. With such expenditure of energy, Xiao Chen was afraid that she might have overdid it.Ao Jiao shook her head,\u201d I\u2019m fine. The amount of energy I fed it is enough to last it for three months. After that, you can feed it porridge.\u201cYou have not given this fellow a name yet, right? How about you give it a name?\u201d Ao Jiao suddenly thought of this problem.Xiao Chen thought for a while before asking: \u201cIs it a boy or a girl? No, I mean, is it male or female?\u201d\u201cYou idiot! Forget about it, just call him Xiao Bai.\u201d Ao Jiao said with some resentment.Xiao Bai, Xiao Bai, Xiao Chen muttered to himself.\u00a0This name should be belonging to a female. Would it become a vixen in future?Damn it, What am I thinking of again\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 47": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 46:\u00a0Entering Linlang Pavilion AgainAfter resolving Xiao Bai\u2019s problems, Xiao Chen took out the Azure Dragon Medicine Cauldron and prepared to refine the medicine. Ao Jiao stayed at the side, playing with Xiao Bai. She had no intention of leaving.Xiao Chen sighed. It seemed that he would not be able to hide any of his secrets from Ao Jiao in future. But this was something that he could not do anything about. Ao Jiao\u2019s strength was way higher than her master\u2019s.Even if he wished to object, he would still have no chance of winning. However, he had a feeling that despite her unpleasant words, she did not have any schemes in her heart and would not do anything to harm him.Under certain circumstances, she would even help him solve some problems. Just like how she solved the problem of feeding Xiao Bai. She had spent a tremendous amount of energy in order to produce those few drops of milky-white liquid.Shaking his head, Xiao Chen cast all these nonsensical thoughts aside. He began to focus on refining medicine. He was about to refine two new pills, a healing type of pill and a burst of strength type of pill.After his experience on Seven Horn Mountain, he realized that it was impossible to completely avoid injuries in battle. If he had a pill for healing back then, one that could heal his injuries rapidly, then he might not have ended up in such a sorry state.As for the burst of strength type of pill, it would allow the user to increase their strength for a short period of time. At a critical moment, he could use this to make a counter-attack.The two pills he intended to refine were called the Blood Replenishing Pill and the Cloud Swallowing Pill. The latter pill had very severe side effects. Although after consuming it, it would have very strong effects, after the effects wore off, it would cause a lot of damage to the body.Xiao Chen refined these two pills in a bid to protect his life. As long as he did not use them frequently, they would not cause any hidden or lasting damage to his body.Compared against similar pills of this world, their effects were much better.First, he prepared the ingredients that he needed.\u00a0The green core in his sea of consciousness immediately entered the herb together with his Spiritual Sense.\u00a0He was then able to take a very clear look of the inner structures of the herb.With a \u2018Pu\u2019 sound, the purple flame \u00a0from his palm came to life. Xiao Chen was now completely focused, he did not dare to get distracted.In the Compendium of Cultivation, these two pills were not highly ranked. Thus, it was not particularly difficult to refine them. With the assistance of his Spiritual Awareness and Spiritual Sense, it could be said that this endeavor would go smoothly.Soon, a fragrance wafted out from the medicinal cauldron. The first pill successfully came out of the cauldron. Xiao Chen revealed a satisfied expression and took out a porcelain bottle, keeping the Blood Replenishing Pill in it.\u201cDumbass Master, I didn\u2019t think you could refine medicine too.\u00a0Furthermore, your method of refining medicine is different from the usual methods of alchemists,\u201d Ao Jiao looked at Xiao Chen in astonishment. Earlier, she was afraid of distracting Xiao Chen so she did not say anything.Hearing Ao Jiao\u2019s words, Xiao Chen felt some pride in his heart. He smiled, \u201cYou look down on me too much. This is not the only thing I know.\u201dAo Jiao snorted, \u201cWith just a little skill and you\u2019re already so cocky. Seems like you are not aware of the heights of heaven and the depth of the earth.\u201d[TL notes: not aware of the heights of heaven and the depth of the earth is a similar expression to frog in the well. Basically, it means that he is ignorant of the greatness of what is available out there]What do you mean just a little skill?\u00a0He used the alchemy methods in the Compendium of Cultivation and was able to achieve a 90 percent success rate when refining Rank 3 pills and below. This was already much better than the ordinary alchemist of this world.Xiao Chen said in an unconvinced tone, \u201cIf you have the ability, then refine a pill that is exactly the same for me to see.\u201dAo Jiao stared blankly for awhile. Her cute face had the impression of seeing something extremely funny, along with some astonishment. After a moment, she smiled coldly, \u201cIf I can refine it, what will you do? There needs to be some kind of wager.\u201d\u201cDeal! If you can successfully refine it, you may request of me, anything. However, if you fail, then you are no longer allowed to call me an idiot.\u201d Xiao Chen did not stop to think deeper before he said this.Xiao Chen was very confident in his alchemy skills. Even if Ao Jiao could really refine medicines, she had only seen him done it once and she did not know the recipe. Under such conditions, it was impossible for her to succeed.Ao Jiao said: \u201cHow ignorant! I shall teach you a lesson today, so that you won\u2019t die by being beaten to death by others for being so cocky.\u201dAfter Ao Jiao said that, she flicked her fingers three times. Three white flames appeared out of nowhere, quietly floating in the air. Her hand positions kept changing until, under her manipulation, the herbs on the table all flew into the air.It looked very dazzling. Xiao Chen thought of the flair bartenders from his previous life. This had seemed very familiar, it was gorgeous and dazzling.[TL notes: Flair Bartenders are bartenders that entertain guests by doing tricks like tossing the bottles around.]Xiao Chen stood at the side consoling himself.\u00a0There is no need to worry. Since she is doing it in such a flashy manner, there must be some trickery to it. Alchemy is very serious business.\u201cSou! Sou! Sou!\u201dAo jiao\u2019s hands moved as fast as lightning, accurately pinpointing the three herbs that were needed amongst the herbs that filled the air. She sent them into the three white flames. Each of the white flames handled one herb each, giving off a continual sizzling sound.Before finishing, Ao Jiao changed the posture of her hands once again. The herbs that were falling floated into the air again. \u201cDong! Dong! Dong!\u201d Ao Jiao had multitasked. It was unknown when she made three porcelain bottles appear, but she had accurately caught the falling medicinal liquid.Her right hand moved again, causing the three while flames to start refining the three different medicinal liquids. After a moment, the six herbs that were required for the Blood Replenishing Pill had been completely refined.Xiao Chen was astonished to see all these. At this moment, he saw what Ao Jiao had meant. This was a pinnacle alchemy method that pursued speed.Just by using one flame to refined the medicinal liquid, Xiao Chen already found it taxing. However, Ao Jiao was able to use three flames at once. This was something that Xiao Chen did not dare to think of. The degree of control she had over the flames had reached a terrifying level.Xiao Chen knew that he would be losing this bet today. However, he did not feel that it was a pity. To be able to observe Ao Jiao\u2019s exquisite techniques was a beneficial learning opportunity for him.As he had expected, Ao Jiao was able to carry out the last few steps smoothly. There was no careless mistakes or hesitation.However, at the last step, while she was nourishing the pill, a look of extreme weakness appeared on her face. A soft exploding sound came from the inside of the Azure Dragon Medicine Cauldron.The refining of this pill actually failed. It actually failed at the stage where it was\u00a0impossible\u00a0to fail. Xiao Chen thought that he was lucky. However, very soon, he figured out the reason for Ao Jiao\u2019s failure.When Ao Jiao made the milky-white liquid to feed Xiao Bai, she had exhausted too much of her energy. Without resting much, she then used a high difficulty technique to refine medicine. At the final step, she was not able to supply the required Essence.\u201cHow is this\u2026 possible.\u201d Ao Jiao looked in disbelief as she saw a pile of waste material come out from the dragon mouth. She had actually failed to succeed.Xiao Chen coughed, \u201cErm\u2026 Sister Ao Jiao. The words you said earlier still counts right?\u201dAo Jiao blushed, \u201cAsshole, I won\u2019t call you idiot anymore in future.\u201d After she said that, she went back into the Universe Ring.Xiao Bai saw Ao Jiao suddenly disappear. It seemed to not understand what happened as he skipped around, looking for Ao Jiao. However, it was not able to find her after a long period of time. It then looked at Xiao Chen anxiously.Xiao Chen saw Xiao Bai\u2019s looks and smiled, \u201cStop looking, your mother is hiding.\u201d...The following two days, Xiao Chen did not go out at all. He stayed in his room continuously refining medicine. Aside from the two pills mentioned earlier, he refined a third pill type. Altogether, he had refined quite a lot of pills. After all, he was not lacking in ingredients and did not have to go out purchasing herbs anymore.Aside from refining medicine, Xiao Chen spent the rest of his time investigating the methods of using the Purple Thunder True Fire. He experimented on increasing the penetrating ability of the Purple Thunder True Fire and had obtained remarkable results.His Purple Thunder True Fire was already able to penetrate through two inches of fine iron without exploding.In the early morning, two days later, Xiao Chen donned that black cloak once again and placed all the Moonstone he normally left home in the past, into the ring. Then, he left the Xiao Residence and headed for Mohe City.The city was as bustling as it was before. Although Xiao Chen\u2019s get up was a little strange, it still had not attracted too much attention.He took his time as he made his way to Linlang Pavilion. His purpose in coming out today, aside from claiming his earnings from the Linlang Pavilion\u2019s auction, was to forge a Spirit Weapon.When his figure appeared at the doors of Linlang Pavilion, the guard at the front of the door wanted to stop him when he saw his get up. At this point of time, a person quickly shouted out, stopping his colleague from doing so.\u201cSenior, you are finally here. The Pavilion Master has been waiting for you for a long time already.\u201dXiao Chen was surprised. There was actually someone who could recognize him at the front door. He carefully observed the person before realizing that he was the person he had beaten up before\u2014Gao Long.\u201cIt's you. Since you recognized me, then help me send a message,\u201d Xiao Chen said indifferently.\u201cQuickly! Go! Bring this distinguished guest to the inner pavilion,\u201d Gao Long hurriedly nodded his head. Because of the matter last time, he had been demoted to being the front door guard.Now that he saw Xiao Chen again, he did not dare be negligent. Before he left, he even left careful instructions for his colleagues, to bring Xiao Chen to the inner pavilion.Although the person beside Gao Long did not recognize Xiao Chen, when he saw Gao Long\u2019s serious attitude, he did not dare to be careless either as he ushered Xiao Chen in.Entering the great hall, Xiao Chen noticed that the number of people he saw this time was at least double the previous time. It was very crowded with little space to move.Secretly circulating his Essence, Xiao Chen avoided them, But there were a few people who purposely came near to bump into him.When Xiao Chen saw this, he had already guessed the identity of those people. They must have been thieves that had pretty good skills. Because they were confident in their skills, they came to Linlang Pavilion give it a try.When those thieves tried to get near Xiao Chen, they did not succeed. They knew that they had kicked an iron board and wisely decided to stay away.Soon, Xiao Chen was drinking tea in the inner pavilion, \u00a0quietly waiting for Nangong Yan to arrive. He felt very puzzled, there seemed to be a lot of people here today but there was no auction going on at the moment.Xiao Chen placed put his cup and asked the attendant beside him: \u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion today? Why are there so many people in Linlang Pavilion?\u201dKnowing that Xiao Chen was the honored guest of the Pavilion Master, he did not dare to be negligent and replied: \u201cToday\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, there was a candid laugh coming from outside the inner pavilion. The attendant quickly stopped and left the inner pavilion.This was because Nangong Yan had arrived. The words that would be spoken later would definitely be something that he had no right to hear.\u201cMy little friend, you finally came. I had been looking forward to seeing you these days.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I did not expect that the Pavilion Master would remember this junior.\u201d Xiao Chen, who was wearing the cloak, had his face completely shrouded in shadows. No one could see his expression.Nangong Yan took out a pile of silver notes. He said, as he handed them over, \u201cThis is the money from the previous auction. The total is one million silver taels.\u201dTo think there were actually a million silver taels. This was beyond Xiao Chen\u2019s expectations. He did not say anything as he received the money. Xiao Chen said, \u201cJust some insignificant Fasting Pills could actually sell for a million. Linlang Pavilion\u2019s reputation is well deserved.\u201dNangong Yan smiled, \u201cThis Fasting Pill is a new pill; it had never been heard of before. Its effects are quite miraculous. With the assistance of my Linlang Pavilion, it is quite normal to obtain a price of a million.\u201d\u201cIf this was the Linlang Pavilion in the Imperial Capital, this price could have been doubled. I wonder if this little friend brought anything to auction today?\u201dWhen Xiao Chen heard this he took out one Blood Replenishing Pill, one Qi Returning Pill, and one Essence Nurturing Pill. He then placed them all on the table and introduced them.\u201cWould Pavilion Master give me a starting price for these three pills?\u201dNangong Yan was thrilled to see these. These three pills were complete new pills again. Although there were other similar pills out there, he was very sure that the recipes of these three pills were different from those others.He had carefully investigated the Fasting Pill that Xiao Chen brought the last time. Although he was not able to figure out the recipe, it was still very beneficial for him.This caused the peak Rank 7 Alchemist, that had no progress for many years, to be very joyful. This time Xiao Chen had brought three different pills. His skill at alchemy was sure to experience a breakthrough again.\u201cJust one pill each?\u201d Nangong Yan was bewildered when he noticed that Xiao Chen did not appear to intend on taking out more pills.If there was only one pill, then it was going to be a problem. When he researched it, if he accidentally damaged the pill, it would be difficult for him to try again.Actually, Xiao Chen\u2019s original intent was to not take out even a single pill. He only considered that he had received some assistance here, and took out three pills to put on the auction.He did not want to obtain large amounts of money. If it was not for some special needs, then it was best that he kept all the pills for his own use.After thinking for a while, Xiao Chen decided to be honest, \u201cPavilion Master Nangong... Actually, I have no interest in taking part in the auction.. If Pavilion Master needs them, I can give these three pills to Pavilion Master.Nangong Yan shook his head and smiled, \u201cYou misunderstood me. With my cultivation realm, these three pills do not have much of an effect on me.\u201d\u201cDo you know what day \u00a0today is?\u201d\u201cWhat day?\u201d Xiao Chen really wanted to know the answer. If it was not for Nangong Yan\u2019s arrival, that attendant would have told him the answer already. However, it was not too late for Nangong Yan to tell him.Nangong Yan smiled lightly, \u201cI believe you have noticed that there is an unusually large number of people here in Linlang Pavilion today. This afternoon, Linlang Pavilion will conduct the once a year, large-scale auction ahead of time.So this was the reason, no wonder there were so many people here,\u00a0Xiao Chen thought suddenly in his heart. The large-scale auction of Linlang Pavilion was a huge event in Mohe City every year.However, Xiao Chen remembered that the large-scale auction was always held at the end of the year. It was not even the middle of the year yet... Why are they holding the large-scale auction already?Nangong seemed to be able to tell that Xiao Chen was feeling puzzled. He explained, \u201cThis is because I will be going to the Imperial Capital at the end of this month. Thus, I wished to hold a large-scale auction before I leave.\u201dImperial Capital? This old man before him was indeed not an ordinary man,\u00a0Xiao Chen thought in his heart. From the first time he met him, he could feel a pressure from him.That pressure was much stronger than what he experienced from Liu Fenglin. In front of Nangong Yan, Xiao Chen felt like the old man was seeing straight through him..It seemed that this person had a very special position in the Nangong Clan. Xiao Chen did not know why he was going to the Imperial Capital, but it had nothing to do with Xiao Chen. Thus, he did not think about it too much.Unfortunately, life is very strange. It was impossible to predict what would happen next. Xiao Chen was not aware that the old man\u2019s business in the Imperial Capital was not only related to him, but concerned him greatly.Xiao Chen\u2019s face was completely hidden, and Nangong Yan was not able to see his expressions. He could not help but feel disappointed as he continued, \u201cThus, I would like to ask if you would be willing to take out more pills for auction to become one of the highlights, so that I would be able to gain some face.When he heard this, Xiao Chen found it funny. If it was another person saying this, that he wanted to use his pill to gain some face, he might have believed it.However, when such an important character of the Nangong Clan actually said he wanted to use these pills to gain face, he was truly overestimating Xiao Chen. Xiao Chen knew very clearly how useful these pills were.The Nangong Clan is one of the four great clans of the Great Qin Nation. The clan head, Nangong Lie, was an expert of the Martial Monarch realm. Out of the ten people who had the ability to suppress the nation, he ranks number two.These pills were overrated by him. They were just equivalent to the Rank 4 pills of this world. With regards to the Nangong Clan, they would not even be worth mentioning.The old man in front of him clearly had an extraordinary position in the Nangong Clan. There should be countless treasures at his disposal. How could he be lacking such Rank 4 pills?It was obvious that he wanted these pills for himself. The old man in front of him should be an alchemist as well. This was Xiao Chen\u2019s intuition as an alchemist.Furthermore, his rank should be very high. Nangong Yan was able to tell that the pills Xiao Chen refined were refined by methods different from the traditional refining method. That was why he wanted a few more for himself to research.This was why when Xiao Chen gave him the three pills, he was not satisfied. It was also very possible that the pills he auctioned the last time had all been purchased by himself.Xiao Chen did not say any more. He placed his hands into his pockets and then took out three porcelain bottles. Following that, he removed the cap of the bottles.The fragrance of the Blood Replenishing Pill, the Qi Returning Pill, and the Essence Nurturing Pill diffused through the whole room. Xiao Chen said, \u201cPavilion Master Nangong, let\u2019s just be frank here. You want these pills for yourself right?\u201d\u201cIn each of these porcelain bottles, there are twenty pills. Why don\u2019t you tell me what you are willing to swap for them?\u201dXiao Chen was not lacking in money, but he believed that Nangong Yan would definitely have some treasures that could move him. He might as well take this opportunity to rip him off.Nangong Yan\u2019s previously brimming face suddenly changed. There was an expression of shock in his eyes. His gaze was as sharp as a knife when he looked at Xiao Chen.Although he did not use any force or release any of his aura, just this gaze of his made Xiao Chen feel very uncomfortable.Underneath the cloak, Xiao Chen did his best to maintain his calm. He focused and stabilized his trembling body, but sweat still continued to pour out from his back.\u201cHaha! The courage of youth is great. You're not afraid that I would kill you and snatch all these away?\u201d Nangong Yan suddenly smiled and the pressure on Xiao Chen disappeared.\u201cYou won\u2019t. I don\u2019t feel any killing intent coming from you. Furthermore, the last time I left this place you did not send anyone to follow me. That was the reason why I dared to come back here,\u201d Xiao Chen, who had calmed down, said while taking his time.When Nangong Yan heard this, he smiled, \u201cYou are very brave and smart too. You are right. This old man wants these pills. Your straightforward personality is quite compatible with my temperament.\u201dAfter Nangong Yan said this, he stopped. He got up and paced around for a few steps before saying, \u201cIt is hard to say how much these pills of yours are worth. To someone who understands alchemy, it would be extremely expensive. However, to someone who does not understand alchemy, it is just a Rank 4 pill.\u201dXiao Chen nodded his head and did not deny it. He smiled as he said, \u201cPavilion Master Nangong clearly belongs to the group of people who understands alchemy. I wonder what kind of sky-high price you would offer.\u201dNangong Yan smiled, \u201cYou brat, don't play word games with me. Although I do need these pills, I cannot guarantee that I would be able to gain anything by researching them. They might not be useful to me.\u201d\u201cMy little friend, would you be willing to introduce your master to me?\u201dSeeing Nangong Yan suddenly changing the topic, Xiao Chen\u2019s face turned sullen. He said, \u201cMy master enjoys peace and quiet. He would not meet any outsiders. I already said this the last time.\u201d\u201cIf Pavilion Master does not require these pills, then I shall be taking my leave.\u201dAfter Xiao Chen said that, he got up and headed towards the door. This was Xiao Chen\u2019s bottom line. He did not have any master. All the pills were refined by himself. If this fact was exposed, then Nangong Yan would definitely be amongst the first to come and capture him.Nangong Yan quickly got up and stopped Xiao Chen, pulling him back, \u201cIt was just a casual remark. Don\u2019t worry, I definitely want these pills.\u201d\u201cHow about this? I will not offer too much, but I won\u2019t let you suffer a disadvantage either. You may choose any three items from this afternoon\u2019s auction. Regardless of the price, Linlang Pavilion will pay for it.\u201dNangong Yan said this because he guessed that Xiao Chen was not interested in a monetary transaction. Or else he would have just taken out the pills to be placed in the auction.However, Nangong Yan was not willing to take out some valuable treasures. After all, these pills were just Rank 4 pills.Finally, he managed to think of a clever method. It would satisfy Xiao Chen\u2019s wishes, and he would not suffer any disadvantage. It would just be some money.Furthermore, he already knew what goods were present in this auction. Although there were many good items, they were not able to move his heart, so it could be said that he would not suffer any disadvantage.Xiao Chen quickly analyzed Nangong Yan\u2019s words. Very soon, he realized what was Nangong Yan\u2019s intentions. He could not help but call him a crafty fox in his heart.However, he immediately came up with a counter measure. He said, \u201cCan I take a look at the list of goods to be auctioned first?\u201dThis was not an unreasonable request. Most auctions would release the list before the auction. They would even list out the chief item and the highlights. The main reason was to attract people to attend the auction.Although Nangong Yan felt unwilling in his heart, he still took out a copy of the catalog and passed it to Xiao Chen, \u201cIn this large-scale auction, there are many good items. They will definitely not disappoint you.\u201dXiao Chen took the catalog and looked at it carefully. After he finished looking at it, he made a decision. He smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a deal then. I will choose three auction items and these pills will belong to the Pavilion Master.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All the seats of the great hall were already filled up. There were sounds of chattering as they discussed amongst themselves. The auctioneer was already in place waiting for the right time to start the auction.Xiao Chen spoke to the Universe Ring, \u201cSister Ao Jiao, you asked me to agree to that old man\u2019s terms earlier. Why are you so quiet now?\u201dEarlier, before Xiao Chen could finish looking through the catalog, Ao Jiao\u2019s voice sounded in his head, telling him to agree to the old man\u2019s terms.\u201cJust do what I say; I won\u2019t let you suffer any disadvantages,\u201d Ao Jiao said unhappily as she floated out from the ring.When Xiao Chen saw that she came out so blithely, he was startled. He said, \u201cHey, why did you come out? What is it? What if someone is watching?\u201dAo Jiao stated, \u201cIf I do not want people to see me, they cannot see me. Furthermore, there is no one watching us here. You are too paranoid. That old man already took the pill and ran off somewhere.\u201dXiao Chen relaxed, \u201cThe auction is about to start. Now can you tell me which three items to get?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush? When it arrives, I will tell you. I\u2019ll go out and take a look around first.\u201d When Ao Jiao finished saying that she jumped out the window and floated away.Seeing Ao Jiao daringly jump off like that, Xiao Chen felt like cursing.\u00a0He wanted to jump after her and beat her up.Unfortunately, not to mention being unable to defeat her, Xiao Chen did not even dare to jump out like that. There were thousands of people below. If he jumped out, he would be seen by everyone.Complaining silently in his heart, the auction continued. The first item on auction was the inner core of a fire attributed Rank 4 Spirit Beast.At most auctions, the first item of the auction would not be too good or too bad. If it was was too good, it would cause the expectations of the crowd to rise. If the next item was not able to astonish them, they would be very disappointed.However, if the item was too bad, then it would cause the reputation of the auction house to go down. The crowd would think that there was nothing good. The more impatient customers might even immediately leave.As for this first item, the inner core of a fire attributed Rank 4 Spirit Beast, it was an average item. Although it was not a precious object, it was also not something that was commonly seen in Mohe City.The main usage for inner cores of Spirit Beasts was to refine medicines. The method of refining that Xiao Chen learned was different from this world. Thus, Xiao Chen was not too concerned with this Spirit Beast inner core.Just as Xiao Chen started to feel bored, the auctioneer suddenly said, \u201cHear ye, hear ye! This Spirit Beast inner core is no ordinary Spirit Beast inner core. It is the inner core of a Rainbow Flame Python.\u201d\u201cFor people cultivating fire attributed techniques, it could directly raise the might of their flames by a level. It's worth is not comparable to those ordinary Spirit Beasts. The starting price is five hundred thousand silver taels. The auction will begin now. Each raise has to be at least fifty thousand silver taels.\u201dAfter the auctioneer completely introduced it, the atmosphere in the great hall turned very lively. No one expected that such a precious item would already appear at the beginning of this auction.\u201cSix hundred thousand!\u201d\u201cSeven hundred thousand!\u201d\u201cNine hundred thousand!\u201d\u2026...Soon there were many people shouting out their bid. The price of this Rainbow Flame Python inner core rocketed to a million silver taels. Xiao Chen noticed that the VIP booth across from him was the fiercest in calling out bids. Every time a bid was called out, he would immediately follow up.From Xiao Chen\u2019s angle, he could not see the situation in the booth across from him. However, it was not a problem for Xiao Chen. He sent out his Spiritual Sense and the scene from inside the booth immediately appeared in Xiao Chen\u2019s eyes.There were five cultivators in that booth. Only the youth dressed in an embroidered gown was seated. The others were all standing beside him. Their faces were full of respect. This young man must be the Young Master of some clan. The people behind him were probably his escorts.Out of these four people, three of them were Superior Grade Martial Disciples. The last one was actually an Inferior Grade Martial Master. Xiao Chen thought in his heart,\u00a0Who was this youth? His escorts are so powerful, why have I never met him before?\u201cSecond Young Master, I hear that this Rainbow Flame Python is the Spirit Beast with the highest purity of the fire attribute. Its inner core is where all the\u00a0quintessence\u00a0of its whole body is found. It would definitely be of great help to your cultivation.\u201dThe handsome face of the youth revealed an indifferent smile. He had a calm that most youths lacked. He smiled and said, \u201cYour tone is as though I have already obtained this inner core.\u201dOne of the other escorts smiled, \u201cIn Mohe City, the Xiao Clan may be the strongest but when comparing financial abilities, no one can defeat our Tang Clan. Furthermore, the Promise of Ten Years is almost here. Once the Xiao Clan falls, our Tang Clan will be the indisputable number one clan in Mohe City.\u201dThe Tang Clan Second Young Master did not dispute that. There was a proud expression in his eyes as he clenched his fist and said, \u201cI need to get that Rainbow Flame Python inner core. Make a bid of 2 million silver taels.\u201dSo, it was the Tang Clan\u2019s people. No wonder they are so rich and overbearing,\u00a0Xiao Chen thought in his heart. All these years the Tang Clan had earned a large amount from the fight between the Xiao Clan and Zhang Clan.This Tang Clan\u2019s Second Young Master was named Tang Feng. The Tang Clan had been very low-profile all these years. It was not strange that Xiao Chen was not able to recognize him.Once Tang Feng gave his instructions, a bidding paddle was stretched out of the window. The paddle had red words on a white background; it looked very eye-catching.[TL notes: A paddle, usually with a number on it, used to make bids at auctions by raising it when one wants to bid on an item. ]The auctioneer below immediately saw it and shouted out, \u201cVIP booth 13 calls a bid of 2 million! 2 million! Is there any higher bid?\u201d\u201cThis is the Rainbow Flame Python inner core. Is there no one else interested? Do note that in the entire Great Qin Nation, this kind of inner core is very rare.The auctioneer called out for a few times. Seeing that no one raised their bid, he slowly started to explain the rarity of this inner core. However, there were no sounds of anyone raising the bid.Although this inner core was rare, it was only useful for increasing the power of fire attributed techniques. It was useless to cultivators of other attributes.If they were not a fire attributed cultivator, it would not be worth it. That is why no one bothered to call out a higher bid.\u201c2 million! Going once!\u201d\u201c2 million! Going twice!\u201dSeeing that there were no further bids, the auctioneer gave up on further explaining and started the final countdown.The Tang Clan Second Young Master in the booth revealed a pleased smile. Spending 2 million on a Rank 4 inner core... He was probably the only one that could afford this price.\u201c2 \u00a0million! Going thri\u2026\u201d When the auctioneer was about to finish the third call, his expression suddenly turned to one of high spirits as he loudly shouted, \u201cBooth 11 bids for 2.5 million!\u201d\u201c2.5 million... Is there any bid for more than 2.5 million?\u201d This Linlang Pavilion auctioneer was clearly well trained. The tone of his voice was very attractive.Hearing someone call out a bid of 2.5 million, Tang Feng stared blankly for a while before smiling coldly, \u201cMake a bid for 3 million. Every time the price is raised, raise it by another five hundred thousand. I want to see how long he can last.\u201dOne of the escorts reported, \u201cSecond Young Master, that booth seems to belong to the Xiao Clan. I have seen Xiao Jian coming out of there before.\u201dTang Feng\u2019s eyebrows twitched as he played with the wine cup in his hands. Smiling wickedly , he said, \u201cInteresting. That Xiao Jian seems to be cultivating a fire attributed technique as well. Looks like we cannot let him have it.\u201dXiao Chen was actually not very interested in this Rainbow Flame Python inner core. The attribute of his Purple Thunder Divine Incantation was lightning. Consuming this inner core would not benefit him much.As for his Purple Thunder True Fire, it was a lightning flame. It was different from regular flames. If he wanted to raise the might of his Purple Thunder True Fire, then he needed to consume lightning attributed energy. Not this fire attributed inner core.It was just that he found the atmosphere of an auction interesting. When the two booths competed in bids, the price was actually raised to 4 million.Who was so bold? To be willing to call out such a high price to buy such an inner core.\u00a0Xiao Chen sent his Spiritual Sense to booth 11.Very soon the situation in booth 11 appeared in front from Xiao Chen\u2019s eyes. After he saw it, the corners of his mouth curled up as he said indifferently, \u201cNo wonder the competition was so tough. It is my big brother who wants this inner core.\u201dIn booth 11, Xiao Jian\u2019s forehead was already covered in \u00a0sweat. He was originally determined to obtain the Rainbow Flame Python inner core. However, the situation had now largely exceeded his expectations.Before the auction had started, he had seen news of this inner core from the auction catalog. This inner core would give the Fire Cloud Incantation he cultivated a qualitative boost.Back when he asked the First Elder for it, seeing that the Promise of Ten Years was drawing near and that Xiao Jian needed it, the First Elder did not say anything else and gave him 4 million silver taels.With 4 million silver taels, he thought that it would be easy to obtain this Rank 4 inner core. He had never expected such a situation to occur.He called out 2.5 million, then Tang Feng immediately called out 3 million. When he called out 3.25 million, Tang Feng called out 3.75 million without hesitation.Xiao Jian, who had just called out 4 million, felt his heart pounding in his chest very hard. This was his limit already. If his opponent increased the price again, he would not have another \u00a0chance.\u201d\u201cPlease don't increase it any more. If I do not have this Rainbow Flame Python inner core, then how will I defeat that trash,\u201d Xiao Jian said as he wiped his forehead, \u201cFurthermore, I recently heard that that trash is already a Medial Grade Martial Disciple. I must obtain this Rainbow Flame Python inner core.\u201dWhen Xiao Chen heard this, he could not help but laugh. He could not understand. Xiao Jian had already become a Martial Master. Why was he so cautious against a Medial Grade Martial Disciple.Could it be that when he lost that duel the last time, the shadow created in Xiao Jian\u2019s heart was too big?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

VIP booth 13 calls out 4.5 million. Is there a higher bid?\u201dNo matter how much Xiao Jian prayed, the auctioneer still said the words he did not want to hear with a smile of exultation.\u201c4.5 million! Are there any higher bids?\u201d The auctioneer's voice was full of excitement, tempting the crowd below.The people in the great hall were all chattering with each other. No one expected the first item for auction would actually sell an astronomical price of 4.5 million.Within one of the booths, Tang Feng\u2019s face had a mocking smile on it, \u201cHow boring! I thought he would be able to go on longer. Who knew he would surrender before it hit 5 million?\u201d\u201cHow could the Xiao Clan be able to compete with our Tang Clan financially? Furthermore, our clan head trusts Second Young Master so much, and gave you 10 million silver taels. How could Xiao Jian compete with Young Master?\u201dOne of the escorts by Tang Feng flattered him.Tang Feng\u2019s face revealed a satisfied smile as he thought about how much his strength would be raised when he obtained this Rainbow Flame Python inner core.\u201c4.5 million! Going Thrice! Gon\u2026\u201d The auctioneer was about to finish his call when he suddenly stopped. He revealed an astonished smile, \u201cLook! VIP Booth 1 called out a bid!\u201dAt the auctioneer\u2019s words, everyone\u2019s gazes quickly focused on VIP booth 1 on the fourth floor. Tang Feng frowned deeply.Why was there still someone bidding?\u00a0Despite his casual attitude when bidding, his highest bid would only be 5 million. If it went any higher, he would not be able to bid further. This is because he had to keep that remaining 5 million to bid on another item.Bidding for that item was something that his father entrusted him to do. Thus, he did not dare to be careless. He had to maintain a reserve of 5 million. At this moment, he could not help but feel nervous.He instructed one of his escorts, \u201cGo take a look and see what is the bid.\u201dNot only was Tang Feng concerned with the bid from VIP Booth 1, the auctioneer was very concerned about it too. After all, the higher the bid, the more commission he would be able to obtain from it.\u201cHow come VIP Booth 1 only called out a bid of 1 million taels?\u201d Tang Feng found it strange as he said.Tang Feng felt happy. Looks like this fellow was here to cause trouble. He could not exceed the bid of 4.5 million. Looks like he could relax.The auctioneer below suddenly revealed an astonished expression. His mouth was open wide for a long time before he could say anything, \u201cMy god\u2026how could this be?\u201d\u201cThe bid of VIP booth 1 is 10 million gold taels!\u201dTang Feng spat out the wine in his mouth. He said in disbelief, \u201cDamn! How could this be? 10 million gold taels! Even if the three great clans of Mohe City pooled their resources together, they would still not have enough money!\u201dNot just Tang Feng was in disbelief, everyone in Linlang Pavilion was in disbelief. What was going on?One gold tael was ten times the value of silver taels. These 10 million gold taels were equal to 100 million silver taels. Not to mention Mohe City, there would not be anyone who could afford that even in the whole Qizi County.Even in the Imperial Capital, there would not be anyone who would casually make a bid of 10 million gold tael. This was a huge sum of money. Regular people would not be able to earn that kind of money even if they worked for several hundred lifetimes.\u201cHow is it possible for someone to spend so much money to purchase a Rank 4 inner core?\u201d\u201cIt is definitely a liar. To think that there would be such liars entering Linlang Pavilion.\u201d\u201cGet that person to take the money out! If he is just bragging, we will not let him off!\u201dThe situation below turned chaotic. No one would believe that such a thing could happen in this insignificant Mohe City. Everyone believed the person was just spouting a nonsensical bid.Tang Feng, in the booth, calmed down after his moment of anger. After thinking carefully, he realized that this was impossible. He had been too anxious earlier and should not have lost his calm.\u201cSecond Young Master, I\u2019m sure that person was just spouting nonsense. I don\u2019t believe he is able to take out 10 million gold taels.\u201dThe person who spoke was the one who reported the bid wrong. Due to a bad angle, he did not see one of the zeros. At the moment, he was feeling very afraid... afraid that Tang Feng would blame him.The auctioneer did not expect such a situation to happen. With regards to VIP booth 1, Nangong Yan had left instructions for him. Regardless of the price called out, there would not be any problems.Seeing the situation turn chaotic, the auctioneer quickly shouted out, \u201cEveryone, please calm down. Our Linlang Pavilion will never let in a cheat. What I want to say is that the guest in VIP booth 1 is absolutely able to afford this price.\u201d\u201cThe auction will continue. As for the person who auctioned this, rest assured, Linlang Pavilion will ensure that these 10 million gold taels\u00a0will be\u00a0given to you.\u201dXiao Chen, who was in that booth smiled gently, \u201c10 million gold taels... I do not actually have that much money. However, the old man from the Nangong Clan should have it.\u201dEven if Nangong Yan did not have 10 million gold taels, it was none of Xiao Chen\u2019s business how to solve the problem.\u201cBang!\u201dTang Feng, on the other side, clenched his fist tightly, shattering the wine cup into powder. His expression was very sullen and terrifying. \u201cTwo of you! Go stand guard outside that booth. I want to know who is this rich fellow.\u201dSimilarly, Xiao Jian, who was in booth 11, was feeling depressed as well. Even if Xiao Chen did not do anything, this Rainbow Flame Python inner core would not have belonged to him anyway.Pushing open the door, Xiao Jian walked out dejectedly. He did not manage to buy what he wanted. He no longer wished to remain in this bustling auction....In a secret room below Linlang Pavilion, there were all sorts of medicinal herbs and many types of equipment for refining medicine. There were many cauldrons as well.Nangong Yan took out all the pills he obtained from Xiao Chen and laid them out. There was a maniacal expression on his face. This was his opportunity to break through into a Rank 8 Alchemist.However, this was not the best time. The equipment here was limited. To truly investigate the secret of these pills, he needed the equipment in the Nangong Clan that was in the Imperial Capital.However, when he thought of returning to the Imperial Capital Nangong Yan had a livid expression in his eyes. Following that, he sighed, \u201cIt has already been ten years, I might as well return to take a look.\u201dThe doors of the secret room opened. Two men dressed in black appeared behind Nangong Yan. Nangong Yan turned around and said to them, \u201cAfter I leave, start monitoring that mysterious man in black clothes. Do everything you can to find out the identity of the mysterious alchemist behind him.\u201dThe two black-clothed men were death-sworn Martial Grand Masters groomed by Linlang Pavilion. They specialized in missions that had to be done in secret. As for Nangong Yan\u2019s instructions, they could only object, and were not allowed to object.Nangong Yan muttered to himself, \u201cThe ancient refining methods have already been lost for thousands of years. I absolutely cannot let go of this opportunity.\u201dJust as he muttered that, a dangerous aura suddenly came. Nangong Yan\u2019s eyes gleamed as he fully utilized his perception.\u201cDanger! Be careful!\u201dThe two Martial Grand Master cultivators did not sense that anything was wrong. When they heard these words, they quickly tensed up and stared at the door of the secret room.Suddenly a small figure dropped down from the top. There were gleaming short swords in both her hands. She appeared right above the heads of the two man. The petite figure suddenly moved in the air, and a resplendent glow appeared on the short swords.\u201cPu Ci!\u201dA stream of blood came from the necks of the two man. They cried out in pain and fell to the ground. In the blink of an eye, that mysterious girl killed two Martial Grand Masters.Nangong Yan looked at the girl who appeared. After he ascertained her identify, he was shocked, \u201cHow could this be? A Sword Spirit who is actually able to leave their body and kill?!\u201dAo Jiao did not answer Nangong Yan\u2019s question. She let go of the two swords in her hands and they turned into light that flew towards the walls on both sides of the room.\u201cBang!\u201dThe swords were sunk in the wall easily. Web-like cracks appeared in the wall... slowly spreading out until the entire room was covered in cracks.Nangong Yan did not even have time to feel surprised, for Ao Jiao had already flown to his front. She was actually flying, and did not land on the ground at all. She released an incredible, tyrannical aura as she struck towards him.\u201cBang!\u201dIn his hurry, Nangong Yan quickly struck out as well and received Ao Jiao\u2019s unparalleled strike as both their palms met. Nangong Yan\u2019s body flew uncontrollably backward. The tables behind him, as well at the cabinets containing herbs, were all smashed to smithereens.\u201cPu Ci!\u201dA huge force came from Ao Jiao\u2019s palm, blasting apart the Essence that Nangong Yan had gathered. His body smashed against the wall, and he vomited out a mouthful of blood.Nangong Yan had a painful expression. Before he had time to say anything, he could feel the force in that palm increase again. With another loud \u2018boom\u2019, his entire body was blasted further into the wall.Under the heavy palm, Nangong Yan could feel his internal organs had shifted position. There was a sense of helplessness in his heart. Despite his cultivation as a Martial King, he was not actually able to resist.This Sword Spirit had at least the strength of a Medial Grade Martial Monarch. I wonder how strong is her master? Nangong Yan felt an indescribable shock.However, he could not think of which expert he offended. Although his position was very respected in the Great Qin Nation, he was extremely low-profile. This was especially so in the last ten years. He had essentially entered a hidden state, and had never even appeared\u00a0publicly\u00a0in Mohe City.\u201cMight I ask who is your master? What grievance does he have with me?\u201d Nangong Yan said in a hoarse voice. Even if he died, he wanted to know why.Ao Jiao replied with an even fiercer palm strike. Nangong Yan vomited another mouthful of blood. His body was now buried even deeper into the wall.There was now a human shaped hole in the wall that was tens of meters deep. It was formed by Nangong Yan when he was blasted into the wall by that irresistible force.Ao Jiao suddenly withdrew her palm and Nangong Yan felt his body move. Before he could even breathe, Ao Jiao had already fiercely grabbed his collar and pulled, bringing him back into the secret room.Within the secret room, the cracks in the wall created by the short swords earlier continued to extend further. Rocks continued to fall from the roof. This underground secret room was actually about to collapse.\u201cDo not ever think of doing what you were thinking of earlier again, ever!\u201d Ao Jiao said this before rapidly disappearing.The indescribably shocked Nangong Yan finally knew who he offended. Looking at the secret room that was about to collapse, he felt some heartache. The pills that he refined for the past ten years were stored in this secret room.Although some of the peak level pills were stored in his Spatial Ring, all the pills below Rank 7, his efforts of ten years, could not be completely saved.After finding the pills he obtained from Xiao Chen, Nangong Yan did not feel any more regrets, and quickly fled from the secret room. Two seconds after he left, the secret room collapsed with a loud \u2018boom\u2019.Nangong Yan,\u00a0who was on the floor, looked at the large hole in the ground with lingering fears. He still felt quite dazed. It was just five minutes, but his efforts for the past ten years completely disappeared just like that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 50:\u00a0Tang Feng Vomiting BloodEven though there were a lot of movements at Linlang Pavilion after the incident in the secret room, no one within the great hall had noticed it. After the chaos of the first auction item the once a year, large-scale auction continued in an orderly manner.Xiao Chen watched helplessly as the auction carried on. Currently, the auction had already reached its midpoint but Ao Jiao had not come back yet.He no longer dared to carelessly bid on anything. He had already purchased a Rainbow Flame Python Inner Core. If he purchased something again, he would only have one more chance after that.At this moment, the second climax of the auction was about to start. When the auctioneer said the next item was an Inferior Grade Spirit Stone, the atmosphere of the auction hall surged again.Spirit Stones are miraculous natural treasures. It contained the purest Spiritual Energy, and \u00a0when an ordinary cultivator used a small piece of Spirit Stone they would be able to raise their cultivation by a realm.Aside from this, if they used it in battle, they would be able to completely replenish their Essence. Unlike the fire attributed inner core, where only certain people could use it, this could be used by everyone. It was very effective for cultivators below the Martial Saint realm.The rarity of the Spirit Stone can be compared to the precious Moonstone. In the Tianwu Continent, aside from the Jin Nation who had the largest Spirit Stone Vein, they were mostly monopolized by the supreme sects. If ordinary cultivators or small powers wanted to obtain Spirit Stones, they could only do so via some irregular channels.The auctioneer below introduced the item in a loud voice, \u201cEveryone, please take a close look! What we have here is a real Inferior Grade Spirit Stone. I believe everyone already knows about the value of a Spirit Stone. Thus, I shall not elaborate further.\u201d\u201cAlthough it is only the lowest grade of Spirit Stones, it is still worth 1 million silver taels. Thus, its starting price is 500 thousand silver taels. Each raise has to be at least 100 thousand silver taels.\u201dJust as the auctioneer finished his introduction, there was the sound of many enthusiastic biddings. Everyone in the crowd were people who were familiar with treasures. Naturally, they understood the value of this Inferior Grade Spirit Stone.Amongst the crowd, there were many who came just for this Inferior Grade Spirit Stone. The price of the Spirit Stone kept rising until it hit 1 million silver taels, before the number of people bidding decreased.1 million silver taels was actually a threshold. After all, not everyone was like the Tang Clan or Xiao Clan. They were not people who could throw out 400 thousand or 500 thousand silver taels on a whim. Even for those with money, they had to evaluate how much their clan could afford first before cautiously make a bid.Tang Feng, who was in VIP booth 11, smiled, \u201cIt is time for us to start bidding. The clan head had given us clear instructions. We definitely have to obtain this. Call out a bid of 2 million.\u201dWhen Tang Feng\u2019s bid was called out, the auctioneer immediately reported his bid excitedly, calling it out in a loud voice, \u201cVIP booth 11 is making another move. He calls a bid of 2 million silver taels. Is there anyone with a higher bid?!\u201dWith regards to this high bid of 2 million, most of the people in the great hall lost all hope of obtaining it. Those people who were still able to compete were likely to be located within the VIP booths on the fourth floor.Just as expected, someone within VIP booth 3 immediately raised the bid to 2.2 million. Then someone from VIP booth 4 raised it to 2.5 million.\u201c2.5 million, what an auspicious number. VIP booth 4, are you not going to raise the bid again?\u201d After the guest in VIP booth 4 made his bid, the auctioneer immediately called out in humor.[TL notes: The Chinese writes their number in this manner: Ten \u5341, hundred \u767e, thousands \u5343, ten thousands \u4e07, hundred million \u4ebf. 2.5 million is 250 ten thousands. 250 is actually a way of scolding someone an idiot in China]The person in VIP booth 4 cursed silently and raised his bid to 3 million. The auctioneer immediately beamed with joy as he called out the latest bid.Xiao Chen was actually very interested in this Inferior Grade Spirit Stone. To people of the Martial Disciple realm, its effects were even more apparent. Using himself as an example, if he used this Inferior Grade Spirit Stone, he would immediately become a Superior Grade Martial Disciple.Furthermore, it was not like medicinal pills. It would not leave behind any side effects like making his cultivation unstable, or cause problems for his cultivation in the future. This was because the energy within the Spirit Stone was the purest Spiritual Energy.After using it, his cultivation realm will immediately increase. The Essence in his body would require one day to adjust and be digested before stabilizing on its own. It will not leave behind any side effects.Unfortunately, Ao Jiao was not here. Xiao Chen did not dare to simply mess around. He had already done so once. He could not waste his remaining two chances. Ao Jiao already had something in mind.However, when Xiao Chen saw the saw the intense bidding for the Spirit Stone, he could not resist. This was a Spirit Stone that could raise his cultivation realm.Xiao Chen said grudgingly, \u201cWhere in the world has Ao Jiao run to? Why is she not back yet?\u201d\u201cSince you want it, then get it.\u201dThe sudden voice startled Xiao Chen. When he turned his head back, Ao Jiao was standing behind him. Xiao Chen was about to grumble, but he noticed that her complexion was poor. Thus, he held back his grumbling.\u201cHey! Ao Jiao! Are you alright? Why is your complexion so poor?\u201dAo Jiao said, \u201cEven if there is something wrong with you, nothing will happen to me. Do you think that my body is the same as yours? To think that you are trying to judge things based on my complexion. This Spirit Stone is something good for you, so you can get it.\u201dXiao Chen thought that made sense. Ao Jiao was a Sword Spirit. Even if her complexion seems off, he could not use his knowledge on humans to explain that.However, Ao Jiao\u2019s other words caused him to be happy, \u201cCan I really get it? I already purchased a Rainbow Flame Python inner core earlier. Based on the arrangement with Nangong Yan, if I get this, I would only have one chance left.\u201d\u201cNot a problem. The thing that I want is not on auction yet,\u201d Ao Jiao said indifferently.Xiao Chen smiled, \u201cIn that case, I can rest assured.\u201dThe bidding war between the big-shots in the VIP booths was still continuing. At this moment, the bid was already raised to 4 million silver taels.Within VIP booth 11, Tang Feng drank a mouthful of wine unperturbed, \u201cIt\u2019s already at 4 million, it\u2019s time to make my move. Call out 6 million, let's see who is able to outbid me.\u201dWhen his escort heard that, he immediately went to the window and called out Tang Feng\u2019s bid.Seeing VIP booth 11 bid again, the auctioneer\u2019s smile was like a flower blossoming. He said in an excited tone: \u201cThe guest in VIP booth 11 is always surprising us. The bid now is 6 million!\u201dAfter the auctioneer called out Tang Feng\u2019s bid, the voices in the auction hall started to quiet down. Everyone guessed that this would be the highest bid already.Normally, Inferior Grade Spirit Stones would go for about 5 million silver taels. Tang Feng already topped that by 1 million,\u00a0it was clear that he was determined to obtain it.The guest in\u00a0VIP booth\u00a04 slapped the table angrily. His face was clearly full of anger and helplessness.Seeing that no one else was bidding, the auctioneer said, \u201c6 million silver taels... There should not be any higher bid than this. If there is none, then I shall start the count.\u201dHearing what the auctioneer said, Tang Feng\u2019s handsome face revealed a pleased expression. He smiled, \u201cNot obtaining that Rainbow Flame Python inner core was not a bad thing. At least now I have enough money to guarantee that I can obtain this Spirit Stone.\u201dHowever, after waiting for a while, he did not hear the auctioneer declare the\u00a0end of this round. He frowned, feeling puzzled, and said to his escort, \u201cGo check out what\u2019s going on. Why has the auctioneer not closed this round yet?\u201dThat escort quickly went to the window and took a look. He only saw that the auctioneer\u2019s expression was sluggish. He was staring at the window of VIP booth 1. His mouth was ajar and he was not saying anything.He completely lost his demeanor as an auctioneer. The escort quickly cast his gaze at the booth across them. After taking a clear look, he trembled a little as he turned around, \u201cSecond Young Master, VIP Booth 1 made a bid again.\u201dTang Feng was startled. The wine cup that was approaching his mouth paused. He felt an uneasy feeling assault him.\u201cVIP booth 1 is bidding again. His bid is the same as before\u2026 10 million\u2026 gold taels!\u201d The auctioneer wiped his forehead clear of sweat before finally speaking again.\u201cBang!\u201dTang Feng shattered the wine cup in his hands once again. He had a sullen expression as he coldly said, \u201cMessing with me? Within Mohe City, no one dares to mess with me like that!\u201dThe crowd below turned chaotic again. If this was the first time he bid 10 million gold taels, as abnormal as it was, it was still possible for people to believe it. No matter how remote the chance was, it was not too ridiculous.However, the same person in that booth had called out 10 million gold taels for the second time. Even a fool would feel that this was not normal. No one would squander wealth like that.The situation was now even more chaotic than before. The auctioneer remembered Nangong Yan\u2019s instructions as he did his best to placate the crowd. After expending a great amount of effort, he managed to get the auction back on track.Ao Jiao gently smiled, \u201cWhat a scoundrel you are. You actually dared to casually call out a bid of 10 million. Nangong Yan is going to be frustrated to death.\u201dXiao Chen shrugged his shoulders, \u201cI prefer things to be straightforward. I don\u2019t enjoy this kind of bidding war. Furthermore, this was something Nangong Yan promised me.\u201d\u201cHe would pay for the things that I want, no matter what the final price is. Whether he is able to do it or not, that\u2019s his problem, not mine.\u201dFor the following items, because the thing that Ao Jiao wanted had not appeared yet, Xiao Chen did not make any moves. The chaos caused by Xiao Chen slowly calmed down.Just as the auction was about to end, Ao Jiao suddenly called out, \u201cThe following item is a Superior Grade Frost Iron. Make a bid for that.\u201dXiao Chen did not understand as he said, \u201cWhat do you want with the Frost Iron?\u201dAo Jiao said, \u201cOf course it\u2019s useless to me. Did you think I did not see that you brought so many Moonstones with you? Did you think that Moonstone is all you need to forge a Spirit Weapon? How stupid!\u201dXiao Chen blushed slightly, \u201cI did not think too much about that. I thought that I could just use what I have on hand.\u201dAo Jiao said, \u201cUsing what you have on hand is possible. However, this Frost Iron is the rarely seen Superior Grade Frost Iron. After I purify it, it will be at the peak quality.\u201d\u201cIf all you want is a Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon, then you can give up on this Frost Iron.\u201dHearing that Ao Jiao can raise the quality of this Frost Iron, Xiao Chen felt joy in his heart. Peak Grade Frost Iron was extremely rare and precious. Xiao Chen had a smattering of knowledge about it.In this world, aside from the very rare, naturally occurring Peak Grade Frost Iron, it could only be made by purifying Superior Grade Frost Iron.However, this method of purification was grasped by very few people in the Tianwu Continent. As far as Xiao Chen knew, only Heavenly Craft Manor was able to do this.Given the current situation, after he obtain this Superior Grade Frost Iron, with the large amount of Moonstones he had, it was possible for him to forge a Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 51:\u00a0Human Flame, Ghost Flame, Dragon Flame, Heavenly FlameSince it was so, Xiao Chen no longer hesitated. When the auctioneer started the bids, he immediately called out his bid. Just like before, it was 10 million gold taels.The chaos that Xiao Chen thought would occur did not happen. The people below were already numb to it. The only people feeling anxious were those who had placed the item for auction.Their current emotions could be described as mingled hope and fear. They were afraid that Xiao Chen was just bragging. However, when they thought of Linlang Pavilion\u2019s reputation, they felt that it would be impossible for them to go back on their words.After the auction ended, someone immediately brought the three items that Xiao Chen bid on to his booth so that he could carefully inspect them. None of the items (the Rainbow Flame Python inner core, Inferior Grade Spirit Stone, and Superior Grade Frost Iron) seemed to have any problems.Xiao Chen did not immediately leave. He handed the Frost Iron to Ao Jiao saying, \u201cCan you purify this here? I can feel that there are two people outside watching me.\u201dAo Jiao indifferently said, \u201cYour perception is quite decent. There are indeed two \u2018houseflies\u2019 hiding outside. There are no special requirements on location for purifying this Superior Grade Frost Iron.\u201dThat piece of Frost Iron was about the size of a bag. When Xiao Chen held it in his hands, he felt that it was at least 100 kg. Its appearance was pitch black and it looked especially sturdy.Ao Jiao gently raised the Frost Iron in her hands, weighing it in a relaxed manner. Then she threw it into the air, and a white flame came from her palms that enveloped the Frost Iron.Xiao Chen carefully observed each and every move of Ao Jiao. He remembered every step she took in his heart. The technique of purifying the Superior Grade Frost Iron was a very rare and carefully guarded secret technique. The number of people who knew this technique were few in numbers.Only the Heavenly Craft Manor had this kind of technique in the Great Qin Nation. This was a great learning opportunity in front of him.As the white flames continued to burn, Xiao Chen discovered that this flame was incredibly strange. It was not as tyrannical or fierce as a normal flame. In fact, it gave off a feeling of warmth.What kind of flame is this?\u00a0Xiao Chen thought puzzledly.Ao Jiao patiently instructed Xiao Chen as she continued to maintain the flame, \u201cThis flame is not the flame condensed by a cultivator. This is a naturally formed Human Flame; it is called Bone Specter Flames.\u201d\u201cBack\u00a0when he was alive, Thunder Emperor Sang Mu subdued it while cultivating in the Nine Layers of Purgatory. After he died, he handed it over to me.\u201dHuman Flame? To think that there was such a strange flame in this world. What an eye opener! However, he did not know what the merits of such flames were.Ao Jiao continued to explain, \u201cIn this world, there are four types of extremely precious flames. They are Human Flame, Dragon Flame, Ghost Flame, and Heavenly Flame.\u201d\u201cIn the Tianwu Continent, there were millions of li of territory. There were a total of nine huge Dragon Veins. At the end of these veins, there was the Flame of the Emperor\u2019s path.\u201d\u201cThere are nine Dragon Flames, and it is known that five of them have already been taken. The remaining four have not been found yet. Aside from being buried thousands of meters\u00a0underneath\u00a0the ground, as well as the vile environment, the most important factor was that the four Dragon Veins are able to change their location.\u201d\u201cAccording to the legends, the possessor of the Dragon Flames would be able to establish a nation. A person without an Emperor\u2019s Mandate would not be able to find a Dragon Flame.\u201d\u201cGhost Flames exist in places with extreme amounts of negative energy. It is veiled in mystery, and contains the might of revenants. In the Tianwu Continent, there are two such places of extreme negative energy. They were in mysterious caves tens of thousands of meters deep. They were known as Living Hell and Nine Layers of Purgatory.\u201d\u201cThese two places are forbidden zones of the Tianwu Continent. However, the Ghost Flame that existed there had been taken away by experts thousands of years ago. In these few years, the Ghost Flame has rarely appeared, and these two places of extreme negative energy did not generate any new Ghost Flames. However, this was something that outsiders would not realize.\u201d\u201cHeavenly Flames, this is recognized as the most terrifying flame in the world. According to the legends, it was able to refine everything under the sky. This kind of flame was only recorded in history books. It appeared under the possession of the Tianwu Emperor when he unified the entire continent and established the Tianwu dynasty tens of thousands of years ago.\u201d\u201cFollowing the demise of the Tianwu dynasty, this heaven-defying flame disappeared into history long ago.\u201d\u201cFinally, Human Flames are a little special. They are not naturally produced flames. Or it could be said that they are not completely formed naturally. They were the result of the strongest cultivators \u00a0in this world, Martial Gods, dying. The flame is formed by the remnants of the Martial God\u2019s power, body, and soul.\u201d\u201cAfter a Martial God died, the huge amount of energy in his body would not disappear. After this energy settled down, they would turn into all sorts of strange flames. These are known as Human Flames.\u201dAfter Xiao Chen heard the entire introduction, he felt ripples in his mind.\u00a0Such a strange thing was definitely something that could not be seen in this insignificant Mohe City.He had the impulse to leave his home and wander the world. Unfortunately, the Promise of Ten Years had not arrived yet. Xiao Chen would naturally accomplish the things he had promised. He would not just leave like that now.\u201cDo Martial Gods truly exist in this world?\u201d Xiao Chen asked.Ao Jiao\u2019s gaze never left the Frost Iron that was enveloped in flames. She replied, \u201cOf course, although they were rare, they still existed.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, according to the legends, there are mysterious existences that were above Martial Gods.\u201dXiao Chen continued to ask, \u201cThen did Thunder Emperor Sang Mu break through to become a Martial God?\u201dAo Jiao said indifferently, \u201cJust as he was making his final push, he was murdered. I can only say that it was not his destiny.\u201dIt was difficult for Xiao Chen to calm his heart, even after a long time.\u00a0Such a strong existence like the Thunder Emperor was still killed by someone in the end. It was unbelievable. Were the people who killed him the legendary Martial Gods?He then told Ao Jiao of his suspicions. Ao Jiao indifferently said, \u201cThis is not something that you should think about. Although you have inherited the Thunder Wood Sword, you do not have the responsibility of taking revenge for him.\u201dSomething did not seem right. How could there be such a benefit where he did not have to pay a price? Since he did not need to shoulder any responsibility, it caused Xiao Chen to feel surprised.Ever since Ao Jiao appeared, Xiao Chen felt more worry rather than joy. When he heard her say this, he felt slightly relieved in his heart.However, Ao Jiao\u2019s following words nearly caused Xiao Chen to vomit blood, \u201cAlthough you do not need to shoulder the responsibility to take revenge, it would be hard to say whether trouble would come and find you. Thus, this trashy master better quickly grow strong.\u201dXiao Chen was thoroughly speechless,\u00a0There were too many secrets in Ao Jiao\u2019s body. Why was the sword in the Thunder Emperor\u2019s cave broken? Who killed the Thunder Emperor? How did he end up becoming her master?\u201dCurrently, Xiao Chen did not know much. Furthermore, whenever he questioned Ao Jiao, she would not say anything. Today, she finally revealed something but it caused him to feel like he was wandering around in fog.\u201cHu Chi!\u201dThe black colored metal enveloped in the flames had already turned into a ball of molten liquid. It was obvious that the temperature of this Bone Specter Flames was much higher than what it showed on the surface.The two of them had only spoken for about five minutes and this Superior Grade Frost Iron already turned into a ball of molten liquid. If Xiao Chen used his Purple Thunder True Fire to do this, it would require at least half a day. With such a big difference, it was easy to imagine the strength of this Bone Specter Flames.Ao Jiao shouted gently. When that serious expression appeared on her cute face, he was unable to restrain a smile.Suddenly, a glowing broken sword appeared, dancing around the molten liquid within the flames.In a split second, sparks filled the entire booth. Every spark gave off an intense explosive sound. When Xiao Chen saw this, he quickly hid behind Ao Jiao.Every time a column of flames shot out, the molten liquid in the Bone Specter Flames would decrease by a drop. Xiao Chen thought in his heart,\u00a0These must be the impurities within the Superior Grade Frost Iron.Once the quality of the Frost Iron reaches Superior Grade, there would be very few impurities within it. In order to clear out the impurities, aside from needing very good vision, it required very fast movements. Although the molten liquid looked still, the inner parts were actually flowing very fast.Xiao Chen released his Spiritual Sense and entered into the inner world of the molten liquid. In front of him was a fiery-red world. Even after entering it with his Spiritual Sense, he could feel that terrifying temperature.Within this fiery-red world, there was a substance in there that Xiao Chen did not recognize. It was continuously flowing around. After observing carefully for a long time, he finally got a rough idea.The pure black substance should be the quintessence of the Frost Iron. Occasionally, there would be some gray colored impure iron that was removed.The short sword that Ao Jiao was using was like the precision instruments of his previous life. When the gray colored substance was removed, the quintessence of the Frost Iron would be completely preserved.Xiao Chen withdrew his Spiritual Sense, looking at that cute face, his eyes were now filled with respect. Ao Jiao could not only refine medicines... The technique that she displayed now was not something that could be done by anyone.What secrets was this girl hiding? Can I really completely trust her?[a]\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201d Ao Jiao exhaled and said somewhat joyfully.Retrieving the Bone Specter Flames back into her hands, she gently waved and a piece of Frost Iron that was as large as a fist appeared in her hands. There was an expression of joy in her eyes.\u201cTrashy Master! For you!\u201dXiao Chen received the Peak Grade Frost Iron from Ao Jiao, feeling incomparably joyful in his heart. This Peak Grade Frost Iron, the size of a fist, was more than a hundred times more valuable than the earlier Superior Grade Frost Iron.However, at this moment, Xiao Chen discovered that Ao Jiao\u2019s expression seemed to have turned even weaker. Feeling slightly angry in his heart, \u201cYou lied to me earlier, right? Your complexion is so poor now, you must have gone and done something dangerous earlier.\u201d\u201cTo think that you tried to lie to me saying that the bodies of Sword Spirits are different from humans, that you cannot use complexion to judge such matters. Your current situation is definitely caused by you over exhausting yourself when you purified the Frost Iron.\u201dAo Jiao quibbled, \u201cTo think that you are still using the measure of humans to measure a Sword Spirit. You are not only trashy, you are stupid as well. You can go deal with those \u2018houseflies\u2019 outside yourself.\u201dAfter Ao Jiao finished saying that, she seemed to know that she was in the wrong and went back into the Universe Ring. She did not come out again after that.Xiao Chen sighed in his heart,\u00a0No wonder you were called Ao Jiao. The Thunder Emperor did not give you the wrong name; your character is indeed lovable, arrogant, and proud.[TL notes: Ao Jiao (\u71ac\u5a07), the first character means proud and arrogant and the second character means lovable.]Releasing his Spiritual Sense again, carefully observing the two Tang Clan disciples that were hiding, Xiao Chen\u2019s lips curled up in a cold smile.\u00a0You are too inexperienced to mess around with me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He ignored the two Tang Clan disciples that were following him and headed to the back door of Linlang Pavilion.One of the two people following him said, \u201cGo and report to the Second Young Master, I will keep following him first.\u201d\u201cAlright, you follow him first. Be careful not to lose him. Or else, when the Second Young Master blames someone, both you and I will be in trouble.\u201dTang Feng was anxiously waiting in his booth for news from his subordinates. This Inferior Grade Spirit Stone was something that his father had instructed him to obtain at all cost.At this moment, his plans were disrupted by someone else. If he did not accomplish his mission and returned empty handed, he would not be able to avoid punishment.\u201cBang!\u201dThe door to the booth was opened. Tang Feng saw that it was one of his escorts. He felt joyful and quickly said, \u201cIs there any news yet? Who is this brazen person who dares to snatch away the things that I fancy?\u201dThe escort had run all the way there, and was currently panting. He wanted to say something but could not do so.Tang Feng scolded him, \u201cYou trash, quickly say what you have to say. If that person gets away, consider your wretched life forfeit.\u201dThe escort panicked and said while gasping for breath, \u201cReporting... to Second... Young Master, the person was hidden in a big black cloak, and we were not able to see his appearance.\u201d\u201cHowever, his cultivation was only in the Medial Grade Martial Disciple realm. Tang San is currently following him, he will not lose him.\u201dJust a Medial Grade Martial Disciple...\u00a0Tang Feng\u2019s eyes gleamed, \u201cDid you see the auctioneer deliver the three items to his booth?\u201d\u201cYes, I saw him.\u201d\u201cGood!\u201d Tang Feng smiled coldly, \u201cJust an insignificant Medial Grade Martial Disciple. To think that you actually dared to disrupt my plans twice. I want to see what remarkable abilities you have.\u201d\u201cAll four of you, go take care of this. Just a Medial Grade Martial Disciple... Don\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t handle this. I will go back first and report this situation to my father.\u201d\u201cSecond Young Master, rest assured. Not to mention a Medial Grade Martial Disciple, even a Superior Grade Martial Disciple would not be able to escape from us,\u201d the Martial Master escort said to Tang Feng.At this moment, in the backyard of Linlang Pavilion, Nangong Yan had arranged for people to tidy up the collapsed secret room. He was hoping that he would be able to recover some medicinal pills that were not damaged. After all, those were the result of ten years of effort. If it was gone just like that, it would cause his heart to ache.Right at this moment, the steward of Linlang Pavilion auction came over. There was an extremely unsightly expression on his face as he stood behind Nangong Yan. He wanted to say something but he did not know how to phrase it.When Nangong Yan saw the situation, he frowned and said unhappily, \u201cOld Li, just speak your mind.\u201dWhen Old Li heard it, sweat continued to pour out of his forehead as he said carefully, \u201cPavilion Master, the matter that you entrusted to us has been dealt with already. That alchemist already bid on three items.\u201dWhen Nangong Yan heard this, he smiled, \u201cI thought it was something bad. There is no need to be so anxious about such a small matter! Right, which were the items he bid on?\u201dWhen Old Li saw that the Pavilion Master\u2019s mood did not seem bad, he relaxed slightly and said, \u201cRainbow Flame Python inner core, an Inferior Grade Spirit Stone, and a piece of Superior Grade Frost Iron.\u201dNangong Yan laughed out loud, \u201cHis eyes are quite good. These are pretty good items. Even in Luojie Prefecture, these are still regarded as treasures.\u201dOld Li hesitated for a long time before finally making a decision. He slowly said, \u201cHowever, the bids that he called out were quite high.\u201dNangong Yan said somewhat unhappily, \u201dWhy? Worried that I would not be able to afford it? That you would not be able to account to your superiors for this? What was the bid he called.\u201d\u201c10 million\u2026 gold taels.\u201d\u201c10 million\u2026\u201d Nangong Yan echoed halfway before his complexion changed, \u201cHow much did you say again? Repeat it to me.\u201d\u201cThree items, the bid for each item was 10 million gold taels. That is a total of 30 million gold taels.\u201d Old Li had already expected that the situation would not be good, but he still said it.\u201d\u201cFuck your grandmother!\u201d When Nangong Yan heard that, he forgot about his status and scolded a vulgarity. The escorts around him and Old Li were all startled.With regards to Nangong Yan\u2019s identity, even if others were not aware of it, it was impossible that the people around him did not recognize him. He was the blood brother of the current Nangong Clan Head, Nangong Lie. He was also the Chief Imperial Alchemist of the Great Qin Nation.He was someone who even the emperor had to fawn on. Nangong Yan\u2019s anger was very clear, given that he forgot about his status and used a vulgarity.This caused them to feel terrified. If Nangong Yan really wanted to blame someone, they might not be able to keep their heads.Old Li knelt on the ground terrified, \u201cPavilion Master, should we send someone to capture him? He should not have gone far yet.\u201dWhen Nangong Yan heard this, he felt very angered. Even he was not his opponent. If these people went, they would not be able to return alive. He scolded them, \u201cHow reckless! Did I say that I want to pursue this matter?\u201dOld Li did not know what he said wrong, \u201cPavilion Master, weren\u2019t you very angry earlier? Could it be that you are intending to let him off?\u201dNangong Yan recovered his calm... The emotional strength of a Rank 7 alchemist was not that weak after all. He said indifferently, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to bother about this matter. Remember to never cause trouble for that person.\u201d\u201cIf that person comes again in the future, treat him with due respect and without slighting him. As for the matter of the 30 million gold taels, I will deal with it.\u201dLooks like he had to leave later than he expected,\u00a0Nangong Yan smiled bitterly.\u00a0Looks like he could only rely on refining some Grade 7 pills to resolve this issue.However, he still felt indignant. 30 million gold taels, what a bastard he was to call out such a bid....Outside Linlang Pavilion, Xiao Chen was wearing his black cloak. As he slowly walked, he was monitoring the four people following him with his Spiritual Sense.There is an Inferior Grade Martial Master and three Superior Grade Martial Disciples. This is a little tricky. I have to deal with that Martial Master as soon as possible,\u00a0Xiao Chen thought, and he made plans in his heart.Without realizing it, Xiao Chen had already walked to a desolate alley. The alley was very narrow, and could only allow two people to stand shoulder to shoulder. This was already quite a distance away from the bustling streets. There were no signs of anyone around.This is where they would take action,\u00a0Xiao Chen thought in his heart.As Xiao Chen expected, when he raised his head, there was a cultivator dressed in blue in front of him. When Xiao Chen turned around, he saw three cultivators blocking the way behind him.The Inferior Grade Martial Master was in front and the three Superior Grade Martial Disciples were behind. It was a pincer attack. It seems that Xiao Chen did not have an escape route.\u201cFollowing me all the way from Linlang Pavilion here. What business do you have with me?\u201d While Xiao Chen was speaking, the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation was quickly circulating. All he needed was to kill the Martial Master in one strike.\u201cI can\u2019t be bothered with your nonsense. If you know what is good for you then quickly hand over the things you obtained from the auction. Or else you will die a horrible death.\u201dXiao Chen, under the cloak, revealed a faint smile. His Qi and blood were all surging, and he was now in his peak state. He was just waiting for the opponent to show an opening.Xiao Chen pretended to be thinking; he turned and faced the Inferior Grade Martial Master, \u201cYou want the Inferior Grade Spirit Stone? I can give it to you\u2026\u201dJust as he said that, he waved his hands and the Inferior Grade Spirit Stone flew out into the air. Under the sunlight, the Spirit Stone gave off a bright glitter. It moved in a high arch and slowly made its way to the Inferior Grade Martial Master.Although the Inferior Grade Martial Master was suspicious that Xiao Chen handed over the Spirit Stone so obediently, he looked down on Xiao Chen for being a Medial Grade Martial Disciple that would not be any danger to him.Just as the Spirit Stone was about to land, the Inferior Grade Martial Master who was staring at Xiao Chen shifted his gaze to the Spirit Stone in the air. He jumped and stretched out his right hand, intending to catch the falling Spirit Stone.\u201cHu Chi!\u201dXiao Chen smiled coldly in his heart as he shouted lightly. He stomped his foot on the ground, leaving a two-inch deep footprint. His figure was now moving towards the front like an arrow.When the Inferior Grade Martial Master saw Xiao Chen make his move, he stopped trying to catch the Spirit stone and confidently sent out a palm strike, trying to stop Xiao Chen from attacking.However, he had missed the key moment since he was not prepared for it. He could not stop Xiao Chen, who was in his peak state, from attacking with all his strength.There was wind coming from his palm, whistling, and a purple light flickering. The Inferior Grade Martial Master felt electricity coming from that palm. He now felt a numb feeling spreading through his whole body. He found that his hands and legs were instantly stiff.\u201cBang!\u201dWhen Xiao Chen had the advantage, he did not show any mercy and kicked the person in front of him. Without fooling around, he kicked him into midair.\u201cHu!\u201dA stream of purple flames quickly spun around Xiao Chen\u2019s finger. After an unknown amount of revolutions, it shot towards the person in the air. There was a melodious sound, and a hole the size of a finger appeared in his forehead.When he was kicked into the air, the electricity that Xiao Chen attacked him with was already cleared out. When the flames shot towards him, his entire body was immediately engulfed.However, this Purple Thunder True Fire of Xiao Chen was no longer the Purple Thunder True Fire of before. Its penetrating ability was now on another level. It instantly penetrated his Essence shield.The flames that entered his brain started to burn within his body. The hole that was created by the flames grew larger and larger.Under the sun, his body was now like a burning log. After he was burned, he turned to ashes that slowly fell from the sky. When the wind blew, they were scattered and turned into dust forever.While it took a long time to describe everything that happened, all this actually took only an instant to occur. From the time he caused his opponent to go numb, to kicking him into mid-air and firing the Purple Thunder True Fire, only three breaths of time had passed.When the three people behind saw their companion turned to ashes, there was a boundless fear that appeared in their eyes. In the blink of an eye, the strongest person was eliminated by Xiao Chen.Was this person really a Medial Grade Martial Disciple? They cast their gazes on Xiao Chen, who was clad in that black cloak, once again. This time, Xiao Chen looked like the grim reaper that came from hell.\u201cDamn! No matter how strong he is, he is still just a Medial Grade Martial Disciple. Furthermore, he did not have a Spirit Weapon. I do not believe that he can kill all three of us,\u201d one of the three men said bravely.When the other two men heard that, they hurriedly drew their weapons. The mission that the Second Young Master had given them could not fail or else the punishment they would suffer would be very severe.Although the person in front of them was terrifying, they still had a chance of winning. However, after they drew their weapons they realized they would not be useful in this narrow alley. They could not help but feel vexed.Xiao Chen smiled as he ridiculed them slightly, \u201cDid you think that I randomly walked into this alley? Since you so foolishly followed me, none of you will escape today.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 54": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53:\u00a0Listening To the Sword and Communicating With ItThe three Superior Grade Martial Disciples could not utilize their weapons in this narrow alley. Only two people were able to stand side by side here. Xiao Chen only needed to face two of them at a time, and this was not a very difficult thing to do.Furthermore, since the alley was as wide as the two men standing next to each other, it was more convenient for Xiao Chen to move around. After he dealt with these three men, Xiao Chen did not exhaust even half of his Essence.Firing out a few streams of flames, he turned all the bodies on the ground into ashes. Xiao Chen removed his black cloak and slowly left this desolated alley.Continuing to walk forward, there was actually a smithy at the end of the alley. This smithy looked very old. The paint on the signboard had already mostly dropped off, and it looked like a piece of rotting wooden board.Xiao Chen thought of his purpose in coming out today. He decided to go in to take a look since he was already \u00a0there. He would not lose anything just by checking it out.The size of this shop was very small. There was not even a complete shelf in the narrow store. Most of the ironware was just casually piled in various corners, making the shop appear even more cluttered.Xiao Chen looked around, and in the pile of ironware he even discovered some farming tools. He could not help but feel that it was funny.\u00a0To think that they made farming tools. This showed how poor their business was. And to think that I actually considered coming here to forge a Spirit Weapon.The biggest problem was that, despite Xiao Chen being in the shop for quite awhile already, there was no one around. This caused him to feel leery. Xiao Chen did not have any intentions of staying longer, and was about to leave.\u201cHang on, don\u2019t go yet. Go take a look at those weapons in that corner,\u201d Ao Jiao\u2019s voice suddenly appeared in his mind.Xiao Chen said while in a bad mood, \u201cIt\u2019s just a pile of junk. There is nothing to see.\u201d\u201cIf I tell you to take a look, just go and take a look.\u201dXiao Chen felt helpless as he walked towards that corner and casually pulled out a sword. It was two fingers wide and about a meter long. It was made of fine iron, but it did not look gorgeous and appeared extremely ordinary.Xiao Chen was not really good with weapons. After taking a long look, he was not able to see anything special. He got up and held the sword in his hand, and casually brandished it.Xiao Chen used the sword and thrust out in many directions. There were no sounds coming from it, and Xiao Chen was not able to detect any bizarre powers.He then placed the sword back in the corner. Then, Xiao Chen suddenly thought of something. He picked up the sword again and brandished it once more. Just like earlier, there was no sound, nor could he feel any unusual power.A look of amazement flashed in his eyes. He placed the sword in his hands down and picked out a thinner sword. He brandished it with some strength and like before, he did not hear any strange sounds coming from it, or any sound for that matter.\u201cWhy is there \u00a0no sound coming from this sword? If the earlier sword was explained by the sword being too heavy, this sword was thin as a cicada\u2019s wings. Why was there still no sound?\u201d Xiao Chen said bewilderedly.Ao Jiao suddenly came out and said, \u201cSwords are not used in such a manner.\u201dXiao Chen noticed that her complexation was a lot better already. He was now able to put down his earlier worry as he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with this sword?\u201dAo Jiao did not say anything. She took the sword from Xiao Chen\u2019s hands and casually got into a stance. Her whole body quietly stood there. Xiao Chen could feel her aura continually rising, as though she was going to pierce through the heavens in the next moment.\u201cPu Zi!\u201dAo Jiao suddenly made a move and sliced the sword through the air. The sword that was as thin as a cicada\u2019s wing gave off a pleasant hum. The sound was melodious; it was fine and delicate, like rain falling on the ground, dripping incessantly.\u201cWeng!\u201d The sword sounds kept resounding out.In the next instant, all the weapons within the shop started humming as well. It was like someone meeting their ideal partner; the sound was extremely joyful.Xiao Chen could not believe what he saw. He took back the sword from Ao Jiao and all the swords in the shop immediately stopped humming. No matter how much force Xiao Chen used, there was no sound at all... As if it was dead.Yes, as though it was dead. This sounded awkward, as the sword was not a living object in the first place. How could it be said that it was dead? However, this was exactly how Xiao Chen felt at this moment.\u201cWhy is it that when this sword is in my hands, it seems like it is dead? And when it is in yours, it immediately feels alive?\u201d Xiao Chen voiced out the doubts in his heart to Ao Jiao.When he asked about swords, Ao Jiao\u2019s face was filled with a proud expression. Unfortunately, with her cute face when she turned proud, she looked even more like a little girl.\u201cAlthough you don\u2019t understand anything about swords, your analogy was quite apt. Listening to the sword, and communicating with it. People who understand that will naturally understand it, and those who don\u2019t won\u2019t.\u201dWhen Ao Jiao said this, he was mystified. He did not understand anything. Xiao Chen said, \u201cCan you make it simpler?\u201dAo Jiao thought for awhile and said, \u201cTo put it simply, when these weapons were forged by the highly skilled hands of this blacksmith, they all gained a rudimentary spirituality after they were completed.\u201d\u201cTo someone who has a certain perception to weapons, they could bring out thrice its usual might. Conversely, someone who does not know anything about weapons, is not able to bring out even half its might.\u201dXiao Chen was astonished.\u00a0Looks like the person behind this shop is an expert.\u00a0He said, \u201cThere are so many spiritual swords placed here. Is the senior of this shop not afraid of people stealing them?Ao Jiao shook her head, \u201cAlthough the swords gained spirituality, they were just made from ordinary metals. How strong could they be? If they were purely comparing strength, any one of these swords here would not be able to compare with even the most basic Spirit Weapons.\u201d\u201cHaha! To think that I would meet someone who understood swords in this tiny desolate shop. The swords here have not cried out for ten years now.\u201d Suddenly, a bold laughter came from the back of the shop.A robust, tall, and sturdy man with a square face slowly came in from the back door. When people looked at him, they felt he was incredibly heroic. However, there seemed to be something wrong with his left foot, since he was walking with a limp.That man first looked at Xiao Chen, before shifting his gaze to Ao Jiao. There was a shocked look in his eyes as he said, \u201cA Sword Spirit with a strong spiritual nature. No wonder you can understand swords at such a level.Then, he shifted his gaze back to Xiao Chen as he said, \u201cI shall be presumptuous and ask, I wonder what divine weapon do you possess? Can you take it out for me to take a look?\u201dHe was indeed an expert. With one look, he was able to see Ao Jiao\u2019s origins. Xiao Chen cupped his hands and bowed to him as he said, \u201cSenior has great sight. However, this lowly self\u2019s weapon is already damaged, and I am not able to take it out.\u201dA puzzled look appeared in that man\u2019s eyes as he said, \u201cThe divine weapon is already damaged? How could that be? If that happened\u2026 then that Sword Spirit\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have broken one leg, are you still able to forge Spirit Weapons?\u201d Ao Jiao suddenly interrupted, cutting the man off.Xiao Chen looked at Ao Jiao flabbergasted. She had interrupted him; she must be trying to hide something. However, now was not the time to talk about this.Xiao Chen said apologetically to the man, \u201cI\u2019m sorry senior, My Sword Spirit is not good with words. I apologize for that.\u201dThe blacksmith smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, My name is Mo Fan. Don\u2019t keep calling me senior. If you don\u2019t mind, you can call me Elder Brother Mo.\u201dXiao Chen nodded his head, \u201cI am Xiao Chen. Is Elder Brother Mo still able to forge Spirit Weapons?\u201dSurprise appeared in Mo Fan\u2019s eyes, \u201cXiao Chen? The Second Young Master of Mohe City\u2019s Xiao Clan?\u201dXiao Chen nodded his head, however, there were great waves in his heart.\u00a0Did this person recognize me? I don\u2019t seem to have any recollection of him.Could it be that before I transmigrated, the original Xiao Chen did something to offend someone? If that was so, then things are going to be problematic.It was difficult to find a good blacksmith in Mohe City. If his hopes were dashed because of this, it would be very unfortunate.Mo Fan said, \u201cBrother Xiao Chen, didn\u2019t you save a little girl on the streets one month ago? That was my daughter. I did not expect that I would be able to meet you today.\u201dSo that was what happened. Xiao Chen relaxed. He did not expect that such an insignificant matter actually led to this.Xiao Chen smiled, \u201cI left in a hurry that day. Was the little girl fine after that? Was she in shock?\u201dMo Fan laughed out loud, \u201cThat young lass is quite wild. The moment I don\u2019t pay attention, she slips out. When I came back, I already heard about what happened from someone else.\u201d\u201cI am indebted to you. The young lass did not suffer any shock. Everything is fine. I thank you for that.\u201dStarting with this topic, they carried on the conversation for quite awhile. Then Xiao Chen suddenly asked about the doubts in his heart, \u201cElder Brother Mo, why was it when I came, there was no one watching the shop?\u201dMo Fan smiled awkwardly for a while, \u201cHumans have three needs. I have no other people working in this shop, so there was no one watching the shop.\u201d[TL notes: Humans have three needs is a Chinese saying for three things that humans have to do: Eat, Pee, Poop.]Xiao Chen sweated internally,\u00a0Why did he not think of this reason?\u00a0He quickly changed the topic, \u201cElder Brother Mo, are you still able to forge Spirit Weapons?\u201dWhen Mo Fan heard this, the expression slowly turned cautious, \u201cBrother Xiao Chen, I would like to speak to your Sword Spirit alone. Could you give us some space?\u201d\u201cExactly what I intended. You don\u2019t have to care about the opinion of this trash,\u201d Ao Jiao said.Xiao Chen felt somewhat\u00a0unresigned. He had just exterminated four cultivators that had higher cultivation realms than him. Why was Ao Jiao still belittling him?Although there was a little trickery involved, they were all killed by his own hands. There was not even a little bit of overstatement in this.Ao Jiao said, \u201cI can tell that you don\u2019t feel convinced. If you can make any of the weapons here cry out, I won\u2019t say anything.\u201dXiao Chen said helplessly, \u201cElder Brother Mo, I will step out first.\u201dOutside the door, Xiao Chen smiled in his heart.\u00a0Although I am physically gone, my Spiritual Sense can enter. The things that you are talking about will not escape my ears.Sister Ao Jiao, trying to hide things for me? Your methods are too naive.After Ao Jiao saw Xiao Chen went out, she waved her hands and a faint yellow barrier covered the whole shop. Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense was blocked.Since you left so obediently, you must have some plan in mind. Do you really think I do not know what you have in mind? How naive!\u2026After Ao Jiao deployed the boundary, she said, \u201cLet us cut to the chase. Which generation\u2019s successor of the Clear Sky Sect are you? Has your Clear Sky Hammer awakened yet? How badly does your injured leg impact you?\u201dMo Fan opened his mouth wide, he then said incredulously, \u201cWho in the world are you? How do you know so much about my background? Why do I feel a familiar aura around you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 54:\u00a0Water of Underworld\u2019s Yellow Springs\u201cThat is not strange; my original body was forged by the Third Generation Sect Master,\u201d Ao Jiao said indifferently.Mo Fan was astonished, \u201cSub-Divine Weapon Thunder Wood Sword! Didn\u2019t you perish together with Thunder Emperor Sang Mu thousands of years ago?\u201dAo Jiao frowned slightly, \u201cYou don't have to bother yourself with my matters. You still have not answered my question.\u201dMo Fan looked at his crippled leg and said, \u201cThe Clear Sky Sect had been obliterated long ago. I am the last successor of the Clear Sky Sect. This leg of mine was crippled by an enemy, causing the circulation of Essence to be disrupted. Now, I can only forge Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapons at best. It is impossible to forge Sub-Divine Weapons.Ao Jiao kowtowed as she said, \u201cHeaven Ranked? That is more than enough already.\u201dWhen Xiao Chen, who was outside, felt the barrier obstructing his Spiritual Sense disappear, he quickly went in. He glared furiously at Ao Jiao, but she just ignored him.When Mo Fan saw Xiao Chen come in, he said, \u201cBrother Xiao Chen, what kind of Spirit Weapon are you looking to forge? Are all the materials ready?\u201dWhen he heard this, Xiao Chen quickly took out the Moonstone and the piece of Peak Grade black metal out of his Universe Ring. He said, \u201cThese are all the materials that I have prepared. I wish to forge a saber.\u201dMo Fan looked at the pile of Moonstone on the ground that was about 66cm tall. His eyes were opened wide in disbelief. He then shifted his gaze to the piece of Peak Grade Frost Iron.\u201cOh my god! Where did you obtain so much Moonstone from? And this Peak Grade Frost Iron? How unbelievable!\u201dXiao Chen smiled in satisfaction. He found a piece of paper and drew out what the Lunar Shadow Saber looked like before handing it over to Mo Fan, \u201cThis is the basic design. I wonder if the materials that I brought are sufficient?\u201dMo Fan received the drawing and took a look. However, he felt helpless when he saw it. This drawing was not a proper weapons blueprint... It was just an illustration of the Lunar Shadow Saber.\u201cYoung Master Xiao, this drawing of yours is too simple and crude. Forgive my straightforward words, but this design of a saber is not a good one. There are many places where it could be improved.\u201dShould it be changed?\u00a0Xiao Chen hesitated in his heart. The design of this sword was something that he liked. It was very similar to the sabers he saw in cartoons during his previous life. It was not a chunky design like that of the cavalry blade.This saber at least had a streamlined design. As a former \u2018otaku\u2019, he had a certain interest in keeping this design; he did not wish to change it too much.Mo Fan saw that Xiao Chen was hesitating and said, \u201cHow about this... I will draw a rough sketch now, and you can take a look to see if you like it.\u201dXiao Chen nodded his head and Mo Fan started to draw. Ao Jiao and Xiao Chen stood at the side and looked attentively. The more Xiao Chen watched, the more he blushed. The rough sketch of Mo Fan\u2019s was so much better than his.Half an hour later, Mo Fan handed the completed drawing to Xiao Chen. Not only did his drawing have a clear indication of its length, breadth, and thickness, it even had simple notes on all the required ingredients.Fearing that Xiao Chen did not understand it, Mo Fan stood at the side and explained, \u201cYoung Master Xiao, based on the drawing you handed me earlier, that Lunar Shadow Saber seemed to only have a length of 1.2 meters. I increased it to 1.6 meters.\u201dNaturally, the longer the saber, the more advantages he would have in a battle. However, most blacksmiths would not increase the length of this kind of saber.This was because the longer the saber, the harder it was to make the saber streamlined. It would destroy the overall form and streamlined nature of the saber. Thus, most blacksmiths would avoid this major change, and focus on minor changes. They would not increase the length of a saber to beyond 1.2 meters.Mo Fan continued to explain, \u201cThere is no need to make a big change to the breadth. For this kind of saber, two fingers wide is the usual standard.\u201d\u201cHowever, as the length of this saber was increased to 1.6 meters, I recommend that you add another half a finger\u2019s width to the breadth. Thus, the saber would not look too thin as a result of the increased length negatively affecting its aesthetics.\u201dMo Fan explained every bit of change that he made. Furthermore, after the changes, it looked even more tyrannical than the original Lunar Shadow. It was not even inferior to the scythe of the Grim Reaper.The more Xiao Chen looked at it, the more satisfied he felt. He smiled and said, \u201cElder Brother Mo, we shall follow the changes that you made. Right, what other ingredients am I lacking? I still have time and can deliver them in a few days.\u201dMo Fan said, \u201cIt depends on what rank of Spirit Weapon you are intending to forge. Furthermore, it also depends on any special requests you have.\u201dXiao Chen did not expect that there would be so many details to this. He asked Mo Fan to explain it all to him.Thus Mo Fan explained that Spirit Weapons are split into four ranks, from the best to worst: Heaven, Earth, Profound, Yellow. Within each rank, they can be subdivided into three grades: Superior, Medial, and Inferior.Above Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapons were Sub-Divine and Divine Weapons. There were a total of ten Divine Weapons in Tianwu Continent. Every time a new Divine Weapon was born, an old Divine Weapon perished.After Xiao Chen heard all these basic explanations, Mo Fan continued, \u201cRegardless of the rank of Spirit Weapon, it is possible to fulfill a cultivators request and inlay a Demonic Core of the corresponding attribute.\u201dThe Demonic Core was the inner core of a Demonic Beast. The Demonic Beast was a Spirit Beast that was corrupted by Demonic Qi. Compared to the Spirit Beast, they underwent \u00a0a drastic mutation.One of the of drastic mutations was the inner core of the Spirit Beast. The inner core of a Spirit Beast was originally an object that nurtured Essence.After the inner core turned into a Demonic Core, it would be filled with a violent energy. It seemed to have a mysterious connection with the world. When it was inlaid into a Spirit Weapon it would give the Spirit Weapon a great strength, as well as the attribute of the Demonic Core.When Xiao Chen heard this, he said, \u201cAccording to what you said, I am still lacking in a lightning attributed Demonic Core. Am I right?\u201dMo Fan nodded his head, \u201c However, Ao Jiao had discussed this with me earlier. Actually, I happen to have a Rank 6 Thunder Roc Demonic Beast\u2019s Demonic Core with me. I can let you have it first; consider it as my thanks to you.\u201dWhen Xiao Chen heard this, he felt incomparably joyful in his heart. However, when he thought about it carefully, he felt that there was something weird. It seems as though Mo Fan\u2019s words earlier were \u00a0a setup to give this Demonic Core to Xiao Chen.When he looked at Ao Jiao, he discovered that she was innocently looking at him. That gaze looked extremely pure, giving him a headache. Thus, he decided not to think about it anymore.Xiao Chen said, \u201cSince you are not lacking anything, when can you finish it?\u201dMo Fan thought for a bit before saying, \u201cYoung Master Xiao, if you are in a rush, I can complete it today. However, you will have to help me. If you are not in a rush, I can finish it in three days by myself and send it to you.\u201dSince it was possible for it to be fast, that would be best. It was better to have such a good Spirit Weapon immediately. Having to wait for three days would keep \u00a0him in suspense.Suddenly Xiao Chen seemed to have remembered something, \u201cRight, after speaking for so long, you still have not said what rank of Spirit Weapon you are going to make.\u201dAs Mo Fan picked up the Moonstone and Peak Grade Frost Iron on the ground, he casually said, \u201cWith so much Moonstone, naturally it will be a Superior Grade Heaven Ranked.Superior Grade Heaven Ranked! Xiao Chen was astonished.A Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon had not appeared in the continent for hundreds of years. While one of the major reasons was a lack of Moonstone, another important reason was the lack of skills of blacksmiths.Within these hundred years, there should have been people who managed to accumulate the necessary amount of Moonstone to create a Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon. However, since no Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon had appeared, it was likely due to the lack of brilliant blacksmiths.According to what Xiao Chen understood, the only people who could forge a Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon and above in the Tianwu Continent were the people of Clear Sky Sect.There was a mysterious bloodline in the bodies of the people of Clear Sky Sect. They were all born with a Clear Sky Hammer. Each and every one of the Clear Sky Sect disciples were naturally born divine blacksmiths.In fact, the few divine blacksmiths in the continent were the successors of the Clear Sky Sect. This was the advantage of their bloodline. This was something that outsiders could envy, but never have.However, it was this talent that led them to their demise.According to the legends, 600 years ago a Holy Land from the Tianwu Dynasty wanted them to forge a new Divine Weapon.Since the ancient times, the Clear Sky Sect had a law passed by their ancestors. They were never allowed to forge Divine Weapons. At most, they were only allowed to forge Sub-Divine Weapons. Due to this strange rule, the Clear Sky Sect rejected the Holy Land\u2019s request.Ever since then, the Clear Sky Sect ceased to exist in this world. In this few hundred years, the Tianwu Continent did not have any new Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapons.When Xiao Chen casually asked about the rank, Mo Fan said he wanted to forge a Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon.\u00a0Could it be that he thinks that his forging skills are comparable to those of the Clear Sky Sect successors?Xiao Chen suppressed the suspicions he had in his heart and followed Mo Fan. They left through the back door and arrived at a yard. Mo Fan continued to lead Xiao Chen forward as they went past a few small houses. Finally, he stopped in front of a stone house.Taking out a key, he unlocked the door to the stone house and he gently pushed open the stone door. The inside was pitch dark. Because the house was built in a poor area with bad lighting, the sunlight from the outside was not able to shine in.Mo Fan lit up an oil lamp and opened up a secret passageway. He said apologetically, \u201cBecause the temperature in the forge would be too high, I had to build it underground. We still have to walk a distance.\u201dXiao Chen nodded his head to indicate that he understood. He followed Mo Fan down into the passage. After half an hour, a huge stone room appeared in front of Xiao Chen\u2019s eyes.Within the stone room, there were all sorts of forging tools. The huge furnace in the middle attracted everyone\u2019s attention. Beside the furnace, there was a large vat.Xiao Chen got closer to take a look, and he discovered that the vat was filled with a black liquid. It looked like ink, yet was not ink. It was so black that it seemed to give off light. However, when he examined it carefully, it was not glaring. This was very contradictory.Xiao Chen had never seen such strange water before and could not help himself but ask, \u201cWhat is in this vat?\u201dMo Fan was currently tidying up the underground room that he had not used in a long time. He was currently not able to answer Xiao Chen\u2019s question. Ao Jiao said, \u201cThis is the Water of Underworld\u2019s Yellow Springs. This is the most suitable water in this world for tempering.\u201dYellow Springs?Xiao Chen shivered and quickly retreated away from the vat. The main reason was that the legends of the Underworld\u2019s Yellow Springs from earth were firmly rooted in his heart. He could not help but retreat backward by a few steps.[TL notes: Yellow Springs is another word for hell in Chinese.]Ao Jiao looked strangely at Xiao Chen and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Are you frightened by the water of Yellow Springs?\u201dAlthough Xiao Chen was indeed frightened by the water of Yellow Springs, he would not admit to it at this point. Xiao Chen said calmly, \u201cHow could that be? That's right, Elder Brother Mo, is there anything that you need my help with?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 55:\u00a0A Refreshing Wind Moving the Youth\u2019s HeartXiao Chen and Mo Fan both tidied up the secret room that had not been used for a long time, and spent half an hour doing it.After that, Mo Fan inspected the furnace once again. He then said solemnly, \u201cI am about to start the fire. When you hear my command, operate the bellows.\u201dXiao Chen nodded his head and slowly walked toward the bellows. He grasped the handles, made of exquisite wood, with both hands. There was a cooling feeling coming from the wooden handle.\u201cStart!\u201dThe flames in the furnace suddenly roared, and it instantly caused heatwaves in the entire underground room. However, what was strange was that it had an ingenious design. After the heatwave circulated once in the air, it slowly dissipated, scattering everywhere in the secret room in a well-distributed manner.Furthermore, there was fresh air coming from the air vents. Although the underground room was still incredibly hot, it was not at an unbearable level. Xiao Chen abandoned the distracting thoughts in his head, tightening his grip on the handles and abruptly pulled backward.\u201cChi! Chi!\u201dA strange thing happened\u2026 Xiao Chen was astonished to find that he was only able to pull it back by a few centimeters before not being able to pull it back any further. He felt alarmed in his heart. What was going on?\u00a0No matter how useless I am, I still have the strength of a Medial Grade Martial Disciple.Could it be that I am not able to move this tiny bellows?The flames in the furnace slowly started to die down. Mo Fan hurriedly looked towards Xiao Chen\u2019s side. He could not help but anxiously say, \u201cYoung Master Xiao, why are you not doing anything? The flames in the furnace are about to be extinguished. This furnace of mine is no ordinary furnace. Every time the fire is started, a large amount of Spirit Stones are exhausted. I can\u2019t wantonly waste them.\u201dXiao Chen felt very anxious; no matter how much strength he used, the bellows refused to move. The sweat on his forehead dripped down incessantly.\u00a0What was going on? What exactly is the reason for this?Mo Fan seemed to understand something and quickly came over to tell Xiao Chen that there was a trick to it.Ao Jiao suddenly called out to stop him, \u201cNow is not the time for you to be distracted. Continue to watch the furnace carefully and prepare to put the moonstones in. I will teach him.\u201d\u201cBo!\u201dXiao Chen suddenly felt as though something soft touched the back of his head. It felt incomparably comfortable. He actually felt a cooling sensation in this hot underground room. This caused him to calm down.\u201cYou dumbo! This bellows cannot be operated just by using brute force. You have to follow the flow of the air when you use your strength. Or else, no matter how much strength you use, you won\u2019t be able to pull it. If you used too much strength, you might even break the bellows.\u201dA fragrance entered Xiao Chen\u2019s nose. Ao Jiao, who was floating in the air, was leaning closely on him. Ao Jiao\u2019s firm and perky breasts were stuck to the back of his head. Her two slender arms were placed on his arms.She slowly guided his arms, controlling the handle, pulling the bellows back. With a load roar, the flames in the furnace immediately soared. The temperature of the underground room suddenly increased by two folds.However, Xiao Chen actually felt refreshed in his heart. At this moment, Ao Jiao\u2019s voice was much more gentle than usual. It was like the most refreshing summer wind, and it slowly moved the restless heart of the youth.Slowly, he forgot about the soft things at the back of his head. Under Ao Jiao\u2019s guidance, Xiao Chen was operating the wooden handle that controlled the bellows at a pace that was not hurried or slow.It was unclear when it happened, but Ao Jiao had already left Xiao Chen\u2019s back. She was now entranced by Mo Fan, who was in front of the furnace.Mo Fan took out a piece of Moonstone from behind him and muttered to himself, \u201cHow wasteful! When most people forged Spirit Weapons, they would only require some Moonstone powder. To think that he was actually throwing Moonstones in, piece after piece.\u201d\u201cIf I was not lacking in the other precious materials, with so much Moonstone there would be more than enough to forge a Sub-Divine Weapon.\u201dAo Jiao stared at the Moonstones that were being continually dropped into the furnace. The image in front of her slowly started to turn blurred...It was the same scene as a thousand year ago; a peerless youth bringing a large amount of Moonstones, heading to the Clear Sky Sect.Because of his strong charisma, the Sect Master of Clear Sky Sect personally went down the mountain and forged the Sub-Divine Weapon, Thunder Wood Sword, himself.When a five-colored, multicolored light rose into the air, strong Spiritual Energy enveloped the entire Clear Sky Sect. Everyone within 100 li could feel that overflowing sword intent.Everyone knew that the sixth Sub-Divine Weapon that was created in the past thousand years was born. She was born of the red light of the rainbow. She seemed as pure at the fairies from heaven. That fully occupied face seemed to have a trace of immaturity, and was at a loss.The newly born girl stood there quietly. With that somewhat immature face, she looked like a child.However, all this did not cover up her pride. She just looked at the world without saying anything. Within a thousand li, tens of thousands of Spirit Weapons trembled because of her.For she was the king of swords. She was the king of these tens of thousands of swords. Although she was just born, she had an unconcealable pride.\u00a0Since I have been born, then I am King. All weapons will have to kneel to me in greeting. For I am the King of swords.I am the Sub-Divine Weapon, the sword of Thunder Emperor Sang Mu!No one will interfere with my pace. She used the sword and caused a light to streak across the sky, flying towards the clouds.\u201cThe Sub-divine Weapon is flying!\u201d\u201cShe is going to choose a master!\u201dThe astonished voices below sprang up repeatedly. However, they were full of joy. No one expected that this newly born Thunder Wood Sword would be so proud, that it wanted to choose its master.However, this meant that they had a chance. If they could get it to yield to them, then they would be the master of this Sub-Divine Weapon. Sub-Divine Weapon\u2014an object that all cultivators dreamed of.However, that peerless man did not give them any chance. He only gave them three seconds to dream. They saw him fly into the sky in a similar manner. Just like a large roc spreading its wings, he was as fast as lightning. In an instant, he grasped the Thunder Wood Sword in his hands.Sang Mu laughed loudly after he descended, his eyes was full of unconcealed joy as he said, \u201cWhat a proud sword! From today on, you shall be called Ao Jiao. I, Sang Mu, will make you feel I am someone to \u00a0be proud of....The temperature of the underground room was growing higher and higher. Despite the ingenious design, when the furnace was burning at its max it was not possible to completely dissipate close to a thousand degrees of heat.Xiao Chen\u2019s clothes were all completely wet. In contrast, Mo Fan had already removed clothes from his upper half, revealing firm muscles.Xiao Chen wiped the sweat off his forehead, he felt that his whole body was parched and hot. The entire underground room was like an oven. He felt that if he stayed here, he would be baked to well-done.However, the critical moment had already arrived. Mo Fan was using his secret technique and mixing the boiling molten iron in the furnace. The previously large pile of Moonstones was already reduced to a few pieces.At this time, they absolutely could not stop. Once they stopped, then all the work they had done would be for naught. The \u2018Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon\u2019 would be completely wasted.However, it was now really hot and Xiao Chen seemed like he was about to faint. He dispiritedly operated the bellows; the moment he let go, he would collapse.Just at this moment, a gust of refreshing air blew on Xiao Chen. This gust of air reached all the way to Xiao Chen\u2019s heart, causing his parched body to cool down, making him feel very comfortable.Although he could not turn his head, Xiao Chen could guess that this refreshing air came from Ao Jiao. Xiao Chen felt a warmth in his heart. To think that this girl could be this kind despite her foul mouth.Right, aside from being kind, this girl was really \u2018big\u2019. When he thought of the scene earlier, Xiao Chen\u2019s body actually reacted.[TL notes: The big is referring to Ao Jiao\u2019s breasts.]Damn it! What was I thinking of?\u00a0Xiao Chen furiously hit his own head before he finally calmed down. He then continued to operate the bellows.The seconds ticked by, and everytime Xiao Chen was no longer able to stand it there would be a refreshing breeze coming from behind him. It would sweep away all the fatigue of his body, filling him with energy again.The large pile of Moonstones were finally all thrown into the furnace, boiling within. All the Moonstones had turned into liquified metal. There were\u00a0drops of Moonstone continually jumping up from the surface\u00a0of the molten liquid.Mo Fan carefully observed the molten liquid in the furnace, the heatwaves that kept coming from it not seeming to cause him any harm. Within the furnace, there was the yellow glow that was unique to the Moonstone.Mo Fan\u2019s expression turned grave as he took out the Peak Grade Frost Iron. His left hand moved in a circular motion, causing the molten liquid in the furnace to spin rapidly. An even more terrifying heatwave was sent everywhere.\u201cPu Tong!\u201dJust as the liquified metal was turned into a perfect whirlpool, Mo Fan quickly placed the Peak Grade Frost Iron into the eye of the whirlpool, causing some to splash up.The Peak Grade Frost Iron slowly melted, the yellow glow merging with the black glow, slowly intertwining and fusing. When the Frost Iron was completely melted, the yellow glow had already dissipated, and the molten liquid now had a pure black glow.Mo Fan saw that the moment was right. He shouted loudly and slapped the furnace with his left hands. A huge suction force came from his palm. The molten liquid in the furnace started to roll around continuously, gathering in the air.The sweat of Mo Fan\u2019s forehead dripped continuously, falling down like rain. However, at this moment, he was not bothered about it. He was currently anxiously watching the liquid metal that was gathering in his palm.Finally, all the molten metal in the furnace was sucked into the air, forming a metal ball that was about the size of a soccer ball. It was giving off a terrifying heatwave as it spun continuously.\u201cPu!\u201dJust at this moment, a resplendent light came suddenly from Ao Jiao\u2019s hand. In the next moment, a stream of light shot out from her hands and flew into the metal ball.Mo Fan said in astonishment, \u201cThis is...Battle Sage Origins!Battle Sage Origins was the strongest attacking origin energy. With it, Spirit weapons could develop the most powerful Battle Sage Attack in this world.According to the legends, the Battle Sage Origins were separated into six portions. Each portion represented a different understanding of an attacking technique. The six portions of Battle Sage Origins were inlaid into six different Sub-Divine Weapons.According to the rumors, if these six Sub-Divine Weapons were gathered together and the Battle Sage Origins were all collected, it could form a new Divine Weapon. However, from ancient times to now, in the tens of thousands of years of the history of the Tianwu Continent, there only existed ten Divine Weapons.As for the validity of this legend, no one knows. No one had ever managed to gather these six Sub-Divine Weapons together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mo Fan squinted when that happened as he took out a golden silk glove and slowly put it on his left hand.It was unknown what material the golden silk glove was made from, but Mo Fan actually touched the hot metal ball that was giving off terrifying heatwaves while wearing it.\u201cChi Chi!\u201dThe metal ball gave off an intense rubbing sound while it was held in the golden silk glove. A column of green smoke wafted from its surface. The terrifying temperature of the metal ball was very apparent.However, the golden silk glove did not melt. Mo Fan frowned as he held the metal ball. He then quickly went to the metal table that was beside him and placed the metal ball on it.\u201cBang!\u201dSuddenly, a golden hammer appeared in his right hand. With a flash of light, the golden hammer struck the metal ball firmly.Forging had to take place while the metal was hot; this was very logical. Mo Fan held the golden hammer and continuously struck the metal ball. A golden glow, that could be seen with the naked eye, enveloped the golden hammer. Each time the hammer crashed down, there was a flash of resplendent golden light.This piercing golden light almost caused one to be unable to open one\u2019s eyes. Slowly, Mo Fan\u2019s entire body had a layer of golden light enveloping him.\u201cClear Sky Hammer! It is truly the Clear Sky Hammer.\u201dAt this moment, there was no longer anything for Xiao Chen to do. He just stood by the wall, watching incredulously at the golden hammer in Mo Fan\u2019s hand.Clear Sky Hammer... According to the legends, it had the ability to turn something of poor quality into something mystical. It was the equipment of dreams for all forgers. Unfortunately, it could only be obtained as the result of one\u2019s bloodline. Only after awakening the Clear Sky Hammer Martial Spirit, could one use it. It was impossible for an outsider to obtain.This was completely out of Xiao Chen\u2019s expectations. He had never expected that the descendants of the Clear Sky Sect still existed. No wonder he could just casually say that he would forge a Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon.For those who had awakened the Clear Sky Hammer, as long as they had the necessary materials, it would be an easy thing to forge a Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon.Thinking of this, Xiao Chen\u2019s emotions surged. After putting in so much effort, he would be able to obtain an authentic Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon. It had been worth it!.Due to the fact that Ao Jiao inserted the Battle Sage Origins into it, its toughness was much better than ordinary metals by many folds. After more than a few thousand hammer strikes, it slowly started to change its shape.The left hand that was wearing the golden silk glove was continually changing the position of the piece of metal. The right hand was hammering away incessantly, like rain falling from the sky in a storm. Due to this, his left hand needed to control the piece of metal in a very accurate and precise manner.This kind of technique that involves multitasking was very difficult for an ordinary person to accomplish. Normally, two people would be cooperating together in such scenarios.However, Mo Fan was able to accomplish this with just himself. This could only be attributed to the fact that the inheritors of the Clear Sky Hammer were that talented, and even the flattery of others could not measure up to their true abilities.After the golden light flashed for a few thousand times, the resplendent metal piece started to have a rudimentary shape of a saber. Mo Fan flicked his finger and shot a Rank 6 lightning attributed Demonic Core into it.\u201cBang!\u201dThere was a loud crash! The Clear Sky Hammer hammered firmly on the spot where the Demonic Core entered the metal. An incomparably brilliant light was released, the entire underground room was filled with golden light.Xiao Chen was no longer able to keep his eyes open. When the golden light disappeared, crackling arcs of electricity jumped around on the rudimentary saber.\u201cWhat a strong lightning attributed Demonic Core,\u201d Xiao Chen was astonished in his heart.Ao Jiao, who had shot out the Battle Sage Origins, actually started to turn illusionary. She seemed extremely weak as her gaze was tightly fixed on that lump of metal that was about to be turned into a Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon. Her vision seemed to turn blurry again.It was a scorching day in a desolate desert. There was a man dressed in black clothing that was riddled with scars. In his hand was a broken sword. As he slowly walked in the desert, he left behind many deep footprints.\u201cBlockhead Master, am I dying soon?\u201d Suddenly, a girl's voice came out from the broken sword.The body of the man was covered in horrifying sword scars, and each step he took, blood would drip onto the yellow sand. Despite the terrifying temperature, his blood actually did not evaporate immediately.Aside from the continuous footprints, there was a trail of blood left behind in this barren desert. The scorching sun that hung high in the air made him look utterly miserable.Hearing the voice coming from the sword, he revealed an expression of unswerving determination. There was a smile on his face as he said, \u201cYou won\u2019t die. There are another three li before we arrive at Phoenix\u2019s Passion Palace. Their Palace Master owes me a favor. I will borrow their Divine Stone to seal you up.\u201dThere were indistinct sounds of sobbing coming from the sword, as though the girl within it was crying. The sound was filled with an incomparable grief.The man suddenly stopped walking; his face revealed an anguished expression before he slowly said, \u201cAre you crying? Having made you cry... I\u2019m too useless\u2026\u201dAbove the\u00a0ninth heavens, within Phoenix's Passion Palace.\u201cSang Mu, my father is in secluded trained. It is inconvenient for him to see you. Please leave.\u201d\u201cDoes he not wish to see me, or is it that he does not dare to see me?\u201d The man in black clothing asked indifferently.\u201cI gave you face, yet you rejected it. You are a dying person; to think you actually want our Divine Stone. What a joke! Scram quickly! If you still don\u2019t leave, don\u2019t blame me for being ruthless.\u201d\u201cTo think that the Phoenix\u2019s Passion Palace, that was passed down for tens of thousands of years, is not even able to do something as simple as keeping a promise. How unexpected! However, I\u2019m definitely getting that Divine Stone.\u201d\u201cYou are seeking death\u2026 To think that you dare to kill me.\u201dBefore the Young Palace Master of the Phoenix\u2019s Passion Palace finished his words, a bloody hole appeared in his forehead. He died with a remaining\u00a0grievance, looking at Sang Mu. He had not expected that a dying man would actually take such actions against him.Sang Mu looked indifferently at the collapsed Phoenix\u2019s Passion Palace Young Palace MasterWithin Seven Horn Mountain, Sang Mu, who had snatched the Divine Stone, only had one last remaining breath left when he returned to his cave.He had a look of despair as he looked at the broken sword in his hand. Bright lights were flashing from it, and as he inserted the sword into the Divine Stone, he said, \u201cI hope you will find a master that will not cause you to cry a thousand years later.\u201dJust as he finished saying that, the holy imprint of the Vermilion Bird that the Palace Master of Phoenix\u2019s Passion Palace planted in him exploded. After an intense explosion, a fiery-red Vermilion Bird flew out from his body. Thunder Emperor Sang Mu turned into dust like this....\u201cPu Chi!\u201dMo Fan\u2019s hand had slapped the huge vat, the water of the Underworld\u2019s Yellow Springs sprayed upwards and landed on the Spirit Weapon. After the hot metal was quenched, the final step of creating this Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon was completed.After the water of the Underworld\u2019s Yellow Springs evaporated and dispersed, a completely pitch black saber appeared on the table. Countless arcs of electricity blossomed from the body of the saber.Everyone in the underground room could feel the terrifying might that was contained in the arcs of electricity. Xiao Chen\u2019s body even trembled when he felt it.At the same time, in the skies above the smithy, the sky was full of dark clouds, and thunder kept crackling.Feeling the strange changes happening, Mo Fan quickly said, \u201cYoung Master Xiao, quickly come and claim the weapon. Or else this Spirit Weapon will end up being an ownerless weapon.\u201dXiao Chen recovered his wits and hurried. He took a few steps over to the Spirit Weapon on the Metal Table. The appearance had completely met all of Xiao Chen\u2019s expectations. The streamlined sword body was comparable to the scythe blade of the mystical Grim Reapers.Looking at this newly born Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon, Xiao Chen suppressed his excitement as he held it in his hands. Instantly, the arcs of electricity disappeared. There was only a reserved glow on the black saber body.In the instant Xiao Chen grasped the saber, the strange phenomena outside vanished. The dark clouds scattered and the sunlight shone on the earth again.\u201cWhat a good saber! I shall still call you Lunar Shadow. From now on, you are my Lunar Shadow Saber. I will not let you be destroyed again,\u201d Xiao Chen sighed in praise.Just at this moment, Xiao Chen suddenly discovered that the space around him was distorting. After 15 minutes, he found himself on a platform on the top of an isolated mountain peak.He felt a pair of eyes on him, staring at him from behind. Xiao Chen quickly turned his head, and he saw a pale man in black clothing staring at him.Xiao Chen was startled. He was not able to feel this man appear behind him. Furthermore, he just stood there quietly, causing Xiao Chen to feel extremely pressured.He quickly tried to send out his Spiritual Sense. However, he was astonished to find that he was not able to send out his Spiritual Sense in this place.Even so, he remained calm. This was because he did not feel any killing intent coming from the man in front of him.\u201cWho are you? Where are we?\u201d Xiao Chen said to the man, feeling suspicious.The man looked at the Lunar Shadow Saber in Xiao Chen\u2019s hands and slowly opened his mouth to say, \u201cLunar Shadow\u2026 Good name!\u201dIn the next moment, the saber in Xiao Chen\u2019s hands suddenly appeared in the hands of the man. Xiao Chen was startled. He was about to make a move but he discovered that his body seemed to be shackled, he was not able to move at all. He was not even able to open his mouth slightly.The person held the Lunar Shadow Saber and took a strange stance. hen he just stood still without making any movements. Standing on the mountain peak, the chilly winds were continually blowing his hair around and causing his pale countenance to be revealed.Even though Xiao Chen was a man, he could not help but feel in his heart that this man had peerless looks. If he were on Earth, he definitely would be able to put those male idols to shame.Slowly, Xiao Chen understood the meaning of the stance the man in front of him took. This was one of the stances of the Battle Sage Origins. It was an ever-changing attacking technique.This man seemed to be wanting to pass on his understanding of this Battle Sage Origins for Xiao Chen to be able to be enlightened a little. The strength of the man in front of him was definitely not ordinary. This was a chance he could not miss.Xiao Chen quickly quieted himself and carefully observed. When he was completely focused, Xiao Chen strangely discovered that the man seemed like he was moving. However, he was clearly just standing in his original spot without moving.An incomparably profound saber technique appeared in his mind, however, in the next moment the shockingly mighty saber technique actually turned into a heaven-splitting, earth-shattering sword technique. Then, in the next moment, it turned into a world-shaking spear technique that was like a violent storm.When his state of mind turned clear, the image he saw turned back to the man holding the saber and standing still without moving.Xiao Chen tried imitating the killing move he saw in his mind to attack the man in front of him. However, every time he got near, his move would be defeated with one move. Regardless of the method he used, or the techniques, it would be broken.The man\u2019s attack was thousands of times more ferocious. He defeated each move with one strike, and with every strike the heavens shook.Xiao Chen moved his finger, before suddenly realizing that he could move. The Lunar Shadow Saber had also returned to his hands. Xiao Chen hurriedly said, \u201cMany thanks to Senior for the lesson. Might I ask what your great name is?\u201dThe man did not answer Xiao Chen\u2019s question and just said what he wanted, \u201cBattle Sage Origins, Qi of the attack, they do not need to be confined to the weapon type, or limited to the number of attacks. One move destroys tens of thousands of techniques. One Qi shakes the heavens.\u201d\u201cRemember to not let her cry.\u201dWhen he finished, a huge Thunder Roc flew over from below the mountain. The man jumped on the Thunder Roc and flew away.The strange space then disappeared. The scene within the underground room returned back to Xiao Chen\u2019s regular sight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He quickly asked Xiao Chen to tell him the details. After a long period of time, Mo Fan said, \u201cThat person is very likely to be the Thunder Emperor of a thousand years ago. To think that he would actually pass on the Battle Sage Technique to you.\u201dThe Battle Sage Technique is from the legendary Battle Sage Origins. It is a secret technique that was enlightened from the Battle Sage Origins. Within the Tianwu Continent, it was one of the strongest martial techniques. Back in the days of the Thunder Emperor, he relied on this to rampage around the world, and he was unrivaled.However, the Battle Sage Technique was broken into six pieces, together with the Battle Sage Origins. Even the Thunder Emperor only learned the Changing Character Formula. If one could learn the six different kinds of Battle Sage Technique, and assemble the complete the Battle Sage Origins, he would be unrivaled under the heavens.Remembering the last words the man said, Xiao Chen stated in a puzzled manner , \u201cThe last words the man said were something about not letting her cry again. I wonder what it means?\u201dWhen Mo Fan heard it, he did not understand either. Xiao Chen then suddenly remembered that Ao Jiao had not said anything in a long time. After he had obtained the Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon, he got too excited and forgot about her.He could not help but feel guilty. The creation of the Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon was only possible with her help. Xiao Chen quickly looked towards her.With that one look, he was astonished. He only saw that Ao Jiao\u2019s body had turned to a very faint illusionary image, as though as she was about to disappear.Xiao Chen panicked and quickly rushed over, \u201cHey, Sister Ao Jiao, what\u2019s wrong with you? Please don\u2019t scare me!\u201dThere seemed to be traces of tears in the corners of Ao Jiao\u2019s eyes. She did not reply to Xiao Chen\u2019s words. Instead, she revealed a bitter smile on her face. Throughout all the times he had interacted with her, Xiao Chen had never seen her smile before. At this moment, he suddenly realized that she looked very pretty when she smiled.Ao Jiao\u2019s hands kept making hand seals, changing constantly, her body turned even more illusory.. Finally, she made a hand seal that was bright, causing her entire body to shine incomparably luminous.\u201cHey, Ao Jiao, what are you doing?\u201d Xiao Chen was very anxious and tried to stop Ao Jiao. However, when he stretched out his hands, he only grabbed air. His hands had passed through Ao Jiao\u2019s body.Ao Jiao\u2019s body finally completely disappeared and turned into an exceptionally resplendent seal mark. With a \u2018sou\u2019 sound, it entered into the Lunar Shadow Saber.Its brilliance was reserved, and the internals of the Lunar Shadow Saber seemed to have some changes. Xiao Chen could feel that the might contained in the Saber diminished significantly.However, Xiao Chen could not be bothered about this at the moment. Xiao Chen faced Mo Fan and asked, \u201cElder Brother Mo, What happened to Ao Jiao? How come she suddenly disappeared?\u201dMo Fan\u2019s expression was grave. He remembered the hand seals that Ao Jiao made earlier and said, \u201cPass me your Lunar Shadow Saber, let me take a look at it.\u201dXiao Chen handed the saber over. Mo Fan received it and inspected it carefully. After a long time, the grave expression on his face slowly changed into a smile, \u201cYoung Master Xiao, you don\u2019t have to worry. Ao Jiao has employed a secret technique to use her body to nourish the saber. She temporarily sealed the saber to make it a Superior Grade Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon.The expression on Xiao Chen\u2019s face did not change for the better, \u201cWhat do you mean? The saber is a small thing. I just want to know whether Ao Jiao will wake up or not.\u201dMo Fan explained, \u201cThe biggest difference between a Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon and a Sub-Divine Weapon is the Weapon Spirit. When ordinary people want to forge a Sub-Divine Weapon, they require a Divine Grade Spirit Stone before they can succeed.\u201d\u201cHowever, in this world, Divine Grade Spirit Stones are extremely rare and precious. Not to mention Divine Grade Spirit Stone, even Superior Grade Spirit Stones are very rare. However, Ao Jiao herself is a Sword Spirit. In order to turn this Lunar Shadow Saber into a Sub-Divine Weapon, she used herself to become the Weapon Spirit.\u201dDue to this reason, this Lunar Shadow Saber was temporarily suppressed to a Superior Grade Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon. However, someday, it will turn into a Sub-Divine Weapon.\u201dWhy did she do this?\u00a0Xiao Chen could not understand. He held the Lunar Shadow in his hands again and said, \u201cHow long will she take to wake up?\u201dMo Fan said, \u201cThis would depend on yourself.\u201dXiao Chen did not understand as he asked, \u201cDepend on myself? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cTry brandishing the Lunar Shadow Saber in your hand and see,\u201d Mo Fan said.When Xiao Chen heard this, he grasped the handle of the Lunar Shadow and used a few saber techniques. There was a cold gleam on the blade of the saber as it sliced quietly through the air; it did not make any sound at all.Xiao Chen\u2019s complexion changed; he rapidly circulated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation and established a connection between the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit and the Lunar Shadow. The body of the saber gave off an electrical gleam. Each time he brandished it, there was the sound of thunder. At the end of all of Xiao Chen\u2019s moves, there was even the faint image of the Azure Dragon on the saber.All of these proved that although this Lunar Shadow was only a Superior Grade Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon, the might it contained was something that an ordinary Earth Ranked Spirit Weapon could not compare to.However, the problem was that Xiao Chen was not able to hear a hum coming from the saber. No matter how much strength he used, this Lunar Shadow Saber would not hum.What is going on? Aren\u2019t I already its master?\u00a0Xiao Chen thought, feeling incredibly bewildered.Mo Fan said, \u201cAlthough the Lunar Shadow had already recognized you as its master, you still do not understand it yet. If someday you are able to make the Lunar Shadow hum, Ao Jiao might be able to come out earlier.\u201dAfter they chatted for awhile, Xiao Chen indicated that he wanted to leave. Mo Fan did not attempt to detain him and sent Xiao Chen off to the door.They had spent quite a long time in the underground room, where the air was somewhat stale. The moment Xiao Chen reached the street and smelled the fresh air coming from the outside, Xiao Chen took a deep breath.The Spirit Weapon was made. Although the process had some hiccups, it had managed to fulfill all of Xiao Chen\u2019s original requirements. His purpose in coming out had been accomplished, so it was time to go back.However, Xiao Chen kept feeling that something was missing. His mind kept revisiting the hazy memory of the contact with Ao Jiao, and the last words that the Thunder Emperor said.Do not let her cry again....Not long after Xiao Chen left, Feng Feixue\u2019s figure appeared in that small alley. She rushed over when she saw the strange phenomenon. She wanted to see who was so lucky to actually be able to obtain a Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon.\u201cThis fellow, he is quite indiscernible! The Young Miss had asked Grandmaster Mo three times, but he still refused to help. To think he was actually willing to forge a Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon for him,\u201d a voice that was a little hoarse and envious sounded from the shadows behind Feng Feixue.A faint smile appeared on Feng Feixue\u2019s exquisite face as she played with a hairpin. She said somewhat playfully, \u201cShu, you are not thinking of killing him for the treasure right?\u201dThe man called Shu replied, \u201cThere is more than one Heavenly Weapon. There is no need to obtain it and offend Miss. However, thinking of the mission that the clan head gave you, it seems that you will not be able to accomplish it.\u201d\u201cI have never liked forcing others, and the conditions that I gave him were quite lucrative already. If he still does not agree to it, then it is not necessary anymore. Furthermore, there was significant progress in the true mission, thus this trip has not been made in vain....At this moment, it was nearing dusk. However, due to the large-scale auction that Linlang Pavilion had just conducted, there were many people still on the streets. As Xiao Chen walked along the streets, he suddenly noticed that there was a large group of people gathered in an area a few hundred meters in front.Xiao Chen recalled that there seemed to be a martial arts arena in front. Given that there were many people gathered there, there definitely was an exciting battle going on.In the Tianwu Continent this was the popular culture, where the people were valiant. This kind of martial arts arena could be seen everywhere. Furthermore, their business was very good. There would frequently be people who had some disagreements on the street and came here to duel it out. For some others, when they reached a certain standard with their cultivation, they would challenge their enemies to a duel.They could even fork out some money to challenge the arena master, potentially winning high amounts of money. There normally was a motive to having a duel, one of the most important was rapidly making a name for yourself.Although the standards of this kind of street arena were low, the news was able to be spread fast and far. If someone could win a few duels consecutively, they could become famous quickly, resulting in some big clans looking at them favorably.Seeing that it was still early and there was a racket caused by the people near the arena, making it particularly lively, Xiao Chen decided to go and take a look.\u201cIs the Xiao Clan full of trash like you? With the little bit of ability, you dared to go around calling yourself the strongest person amongst the younger generation of Mohe City? If you went into the Demonic Forest, a piece of trash like you would not be able to survive more than a day.\u201dBefore Xiao Chen got near the arena, he heard the voices coming from the arena. Xiao Chen felt astonished in his heart.\u00a0The strongest person of the younger generation in Mohe City? Could it be Xiao Jian? Why was he here?Who was the person speaking? The voice sounds familiar?\u00a0Xiao Chen was very curious, so he quickly made his way through the crowd and went in front.He ignored the scolding and cursing of the people around him as he used his Essence to force his way through the crowd. When he arrived at the front of the arena, he finally could see clearly what was going on.The two people in the arena were Zhang He and Xiao Jian. At this moment, Xiao Jian was already full of sword wounds. He looked very miserable, but he still held on bitterly.By comparison, Zhang He, who was dressed in long white robes, seemed perfectly fine. On the surface, there were no visible injuries and his face had an unruffled expression. It was obvious that this duel could have ended already; he was clearly just bullying Xiao Jian now, suppressing the reputation of the Xiao Clan.When Xiao Jian heard Zhang He\u2019s humiliating words, his expression turned to one that was full of anger. He shouted out loudly, raised his sword, and charged at Zhang He once again.Xiao Chen quietly shook his head. Under such circumstances, he was not able to stay calm. The blood rushed to his head and he just charged in like that. This would only result in a crueler humiliation.Indeed, it was as Xiao Chen expected. Before Xiao Jian could draw near, several more wounds appeared on his body when Zhang He sent out a few streams of sword Qi.As Xiao Jian moved forward, he tripped and fell heavily backward. Zhang He mocked him, \u201cEven that trash from your Xiao Clan is stronger than you. At least he was able to cause me to vomit blood. You are not even able to touch me.\u201dHearing Zhang He say that he was not even comparable to Xiao Chen, Xiao Jian\u2019s face twitched. He managed to draw out some energy, and suddenly charged forward to attack Zhang He ruthlessly.He was shouting out like a mad man, causing Zhang He to keep retreating. With this sudden change in the situation, Zhang He was caught unprepared.Zhang He\u2019s previously relaxed face now revealed a livid expression. Countless sword Qi came from his body and caused Xiao Jian to be blasted back.The sword Qi was moving around unhindered, randomly dancing without boundaries, turning into an impenetrable barrier around Zhang He\u2019s body. After Xiao Jian got up, no matter what he did, he was not able to break through this barrier formed by sword Qi.Xiao Chen\u2019s eyes brightened as he carefully examined this sword Qi barrier. Previously, his Divine Thunder Break was rendered useless by this person.Just at this moment, Zhang He\u2019s expression finally turned serious. His gaze was as calm as water, staring at Xiao Jian. He slashed out thrice, and three tyrannical sword Qi flew towards the three major acupoints near Xiao Jian\u2019s Dantian.Crap! He wants to cripple Xiao Jian.\u00a0Xiao Chen thought in his heart, he had to save him.Although he did not like Xiao Jian, he was still a member of the Xiao Clan. Given his character, it was impossible for him to be apathetic and refuse to help when someone was in trouble.\u201cPu! Pu! Pu!\u201dA stream of resplendent electricity came from his hands. Instantly, it streaked through the air and broke Zhang He\u2019s sword Qi. After that, its strength was not diminished, and continued flying towards Zhang He.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Given Zhang He\u2019s strength as a Medial Grade Martial Master, it would be easy for him to avoid it. However, when he saw who fired it, he immediately changed his mind.\u201cPu Ci!\u201dThe boundless dancing sword Qi crossed everywhere; the resplendent lightning was swallowed up by the sword Qi and vanished.\u201cXiao Chen, are you intending to help this trash? This is against the rules of the arena,\u201d Zhang He smiled coldly as he looked at Xiao Chen, who was below the arena.Xiao Jian, who was currently covered in injuries, was already finding it hard to stand up. He attempted to stand up with his back arched forward, his eyes full of a painful expression as he smiled with difficulty, \u201cYou are only a piece of trash, I don\u2019t need you to help me.\u201dSeeing how untactful Xiao Jian was, Xiao Chen could not be bothered with him. Xiao Chen faced Zhang He and said, \u201cWhether I broke the rules or not is not determined by you. Earlier, when you made your move, it was clear you were attempting to kill him or cripple him. I do not recall that this arena handles life-or-death battles.\u201d\u201cArena Master, what do you think? If the eldest son of the Xiao Clan clan head died in your arena, even you would not be able to shrug off responsibility,\u201d Xiao Chen turned around and said to a middle-aged man.That arena master smiled awkwardly. It was true that his arena did not have the rights to organize life-or-death battles. In order to organize this type of battle there was a requirement of applying to a higher leveled arena.Even so, it was rare that people would make a fuss about this kind of matter. Even if the arena had organized a life-or-death battle, there would not be anyone coming to kick up a fuss.This arena master actually had a deep background. He was not actually afraid of Xiao Chen, but at this moment, Xiao Chen attacked his weak point in front of the crowd. This had made things difficult for him.He waved his hands casually, \u201cTwo of you! Go carry Young Master Xiao down. Take that Spirit Weapon in his hands and give it to Young Master Zhang. Young Master Zhang won this duel.\u201dXiao Jian felt unsatisfied but at this moment, he did not have any capabilities to resist. He was carried down easily by the two cultivators.Zhang He picked up that Spirit Weapon, threw it to someone below the arena, and smiled, \u201cSuperior Grade Yellow Ranked Spirit Weapon, this is not bad. Zhang Wu, this is for you.\u201dThat person was also only of the cultivators of the Zhang Clan. When he suddenly obtained a Superior Grade Yellow Ranked Spirit, he excitedly smiled and said, \u201cMany thanks, Young Master!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. Now I think about it, the Xiao Clan does not have any experts. They are all just a bunch of trash,\u201d Zhang He turned around and wanted to leave.The person called Zhang Wu followed and said, \u201cIndeed, So much for the strongest person of Mohe city\u2019s youngest generation. He was not even able to touch the corner of Young Master\u2019s shirt. What a bunch of nonsense!\u201d\u201cI hear that Zhang He was studying at the White Cliff School in the Prefecture City. The one who is teaching him was a supreme elder of the Misty Sword Sect.\u201d\u201cMisty Sword Sect, with regards to their understanding to the way of the sword, it could be said that they are without rival in the Great Qin Nation. Since he is learning from their supreme elder, no wonder he is so powerful.\u201d\u201cIndeed. Actually, Xiao Jian is not weak. He already became a Martial Master at such a young age. However, he was still not able to touch even the corner of Zhang He\u2019s shirt.\u201d\u201cYou guys are not aware of this, but what Zhang He released was authentic sword Qi and it was not the release of Essence. He was born with the Clear Sky Sword Martial Spirit. Due to this reason, he is able to release the sword Qi that only Martial Saints and above can release.\u201cWith the Clear Sky Sword Martial Spirit, and a master of the way of the sword, it seems like no one in Mohe City would be able to compete with him. Looks like in this Promise of Ten Years, Seven Horn Mountain would be changing owners.Everyone below the arena was discussing the duel that just took place. Seeing that Zhang He was about to leave, they all expressed their own thoughts. It had to be said that amongst them, some of these people had quite unique opinions.When Zhang He heard these discussions, there was only a slight change in his expressions but he felt smug and conceited in his heart. When he was in the prefecture city, his talent could only be considered as above average, and he was not at the peak. However, in this tiny Mohe City, he could be said to be unrivaled amongst his own generation.\u201cLeaving so fast after bullying someone?\u201d Xiao Chen looked at the two men leaving and suddenly called out indifferently.Zhang He was stunned. Then he turned around and smiled, \u201cXiao Chen, you aren\u2019t so naive to challenge me right?\u201d\u201cWhy not?!\u201d Xiao Chen gazed fearlessly at Zhang He; there was no trace of cowardice in his gaze.Zhang He acted as though he had heard the funniest joke in the world. He pointed to his own nose and said, \u201cAre you thinking that after I praised you for a bit, you now think that it is true and consider yourself as somebody to be taken seriously?\u201dZhang Wu had just obtained a Spirit Weapon, thus, he was eager to show off, \u201cFirst Young Master, this fellow is too reckless. With a Medial Grade Martial Disciple cultivation, he dares to challenge you. Let me go and test him out.\u201dZhang He considered it in his heart. Zhang Wu was at the peak of Superior Grade Martial Disciple realm. Furthermore, he now has a Spirit Weapon. Xiao Chen was only a Medial Grade Martial Disciple, but he had a bizarre flame.However, he did not have a Spirit Weapon, so he should not be Zhang Wu\u2019s match. Thus, he said, \u201cSure, but be careful of his Martial Spirit. It was a flame that is very persistent.\u201dWhen Zhang He heard this, he jumped onto the arena and shouted loudly to Xiao Chen, \u201cTrash of the Xiao Clan, you are not worthy of making the Young Master of my clan act. I, Zhang Wu, am sufficient to defeat you with ease.\u201d\u201cThis Zhang He\u2026 He must be thinking of showing off now that he obtained a Spirit Weapon.\u201d\u201cAlthough he is not comparable to Xiao Jian, he is a peak Superior Grade Martial Disciple. Amongst the younger generation of Mohe City, he can still be considered an expert.\u201d\u201cThis Xiao Chen is truly reckless. When he was still trash, anyone would be able to bully him. Now that he condensed his Martial Spirit, he became so arrogant. How reckless!\u201d\u201cYou know what? This Xiao Chen had managed to raise to Medial Grade Martial Disciple within a month. His talent is not bad.\u201d\u201cEven if his talent is not bad, he is still only a Medial Grade Martial Disciple. Furthermore, he does not have a Spirit Weapon. It would be impossible for him to defeat Zhang Wu.Xiao Chen\u2019s gaze was as calm as water. When he heard the discussion coming from below, it did not disrupt his state of mind. He just looked at Zhang Wu indifferently and said, \u201cYou are not my opponent. However, if you wish to battle, then put that Spirit Weapon in your hand up for wager.Zhang Wu smiled, \u201cWhat an arrogant fellow you are. Fine, I agree. However, what are you going to do if you lose?\u201d\u201cNaturally I will give you a treasure of equivalent value.\u201dThe two of them stood in front of the arena master and signed the agreement for the duel. This was not a life-or-death duel. Thus, in this battle if it became obvious that the other person was no longer able to battle, they were not allowed to kill him.If one gave up, the other was not allowed to make any further moves. Or else, it would be considered as going against the rules and they would lose the item they wagered.The two of them stood in their respective corners of the arena and bowed to each other. With this, the duel was considered to have started.Xiao Chen did not wish to waste too much time on this duel; he still had to duel with Zhang He later, and that was the important one. This duel had to end fast. Thus, he decided to make the first move.\u201cTa!\u201dBefore entering the arena, Xiao Chen had already started rapidly circulating his Purple Thunder Divine Incantation, and he was already in his peak condition long ago.The moment they finished bowing, Xiao Chen stomped on the ground abruptly, moving forward. He leaped forward, and before the sound of wind could be heard he had already arrived.What a fast speed!\u00a0Zhang Wu was astonished. He had not expected that, despite his lower cultivation realm, Xiao Chen would make the first move. He was too daring.He quickly retreated backward by two steps and his right hand grasped onto his sword. While he was retreating, he sent out a sword light, trying to make Xiao Chen retreat temporarily.\u201cPu Ci!\u201dAn electrical glow appeared on Xiao Chen\u2019s arm. Xiao Chen looked at the concentrated sword light, and there was a gleam in his eyes; he did not have any intention of evading.Using his finger as a sword, he looked very imposing. He moved as fast as lightning and jabbed his finger into that sword light.\u201cWhat is he doing? If he goes in directly like this, he is going to lose one of his arms,\u201d someone in the crowd below exclaimed.The corner of Zhang Wu\u2019s mouth curled up in a cold smile.\u00a0Your speed may be fast, but my sword light has already completely enveloped me. If you dare to charge in, you will lose your arm.When Zhang He saw this, he could not understand what was going on. Only a person who had tempered their body to the point where their tendons were like bronze and bone like iron would dare to use their body to go against a Spirit Weapon.This Xiao Chen had clearly not trained to such a level yet. Why was he so daring to jab his hand into Zhang Wu\u2019s sword light?Xiao Chen\u2019s right arm had already come in contact with the borders of the sword light. If he went forward just a little more, his palm would be cut off, turning into a true piece of trash in the future.However, at this moment, Xiao Chen\u2019s right hand suddenly stopped. His hands stopped stably right in front of that sword light.His right hand continuously kept making hand seals. Within one breath of time, there was an inexhaustible number of changes.When Zhang He saw Xiao Chen stopped, he felt that this was an obvious opening.\u00a0He wanted to move the sword light forward and attack him.\u201cBoom!\u201dA bolt of lightning appeared from nowhere, causing a clap of thunder and striking towards Zhang Wu\u2019s head.This was Xiao Chen\u2019s modified Lightning Descend. Its might was significantly smaller than the original, but it was for efficient. After he got close, he was able to instantly execute it.Zhang He was puzzled by the feint that Xiao Chen pulled. When he discovered the danger, it was already too late for him to avoid it. He could only release all the Essence in his body to defend against this bolt of lightning that appeared from nowhere.\u201cBang!\u201dThe lightning traveled from his head to his foot. Due to the fact that its might had been significantly decreased, he did not suffer any serious damage. However, he was now paralyzed and could not move temporarily.While you are affected, I shall make a move!\u00a0This was Xiao Chen\u2019s plan. He immediately went forward and jabbed Zhang Qu\u2019s chest six times.Six streams of purple fire pierced through Zhang Wu\u2019s chest. They then fell onto the floor of the arena and burned through for about half a meter before being extinguished.Due to the fact that killing was not allowed in the arena, Xiao Chen did not cause the purple fire to remain in his body. Or else, Zhang Wu would have immediately turned into ashes.\u201cHow is this possible? He was actually able to defeat Zhang Wu in an instant.\u201d\u201cIndeed, that flame at the end was very tyrannical. Zhang Wu had already used all his Essence to cover his entire body, yet he was able to bore through six holes.\u201d\u201cHowever, Xiao Chen is very shrewd. If Zhang Wu was not stunned by him, then that bolt of lightning would not have struck Zhang Wu.\u201d The people below the arena started to cry out in surprise, they had not expected Xiao Chen to be able to defeat Zhang Wu in two moves.Zhang He jumped onto the arena and pressed on a few of Zhang Wu\u2019s acupoints, stopping the bleeding. Then he took out some Golden Salve and scattered them on the wounds.\u201cAfter not meeting for a while, your flames have turned even more tyrannical. However, if you want to duel with me, then you need to take something out to wager.\u201dXiao Chen did not say anything and received the Spirit Weapon from the arena master. He then threw it to the front of Xiao Jiao. As most of Xiao Jian\u2019s injuries were external, he had already recovered. He looked at Xiao Chen with a complicated expression; his gaze had many expressions intermingled in it.\u201cTa!\u201dXiao Chen suddenly took out the Lunar Shadow Saber in his Universe Ring and slowly threw it into the middle of the two of them. The Lunar Shadow Saber was stuck in the rock that made up the floor of the arena.Without making a single sound, the saber easily slid into it, leaving only a handle. Proving the sharpness of Lunar Shadow.\u201cSuperior Grade Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon!\u201d Excitement flashed in Zhang He\u2019s eyes as he stared at the Lunar Shadow Saber, which was in the middle of the arena.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 59:\u00a0Demonic Weapon Lunar Shadow\u201cSince you wish to offer me this Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon, I shall reluctantly accept it,\u201d Zhang He said arrogantly as he gazed excitedly at the Lunar Shadow that was inserted into the rock.Xiao Chen waved his hands vigorously and caused the Lunar Shadow Saber in the rock to fly into his hands. He said, \u201cI want your Shadow Bearing Sword.\u201dZhang He\u2019s complexion changed; this Shadow Bearing Sword was also a Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon. When he became a Martial Master, his clan had bestowed the Shadow Bearing Sword unto him. He had never expected that Xiao Chen actually wanted to take it away.It was only wishful thinking. This inheritance of his Zhang Clan was not an ordinary Spirit Weapon. In the past hundred years, many people attempted to obtain it, but they had all failed.Zhang He smiled coldly, \u201cWhat bold words! To think you actually want my Shadow Bearing Sword. Do you think that you will still be alive to take it?\u201d\u201cThis fellow must be crazy. After defeating Zhang Wu, he had already regained the prestige of the Xiao Chen. To think that he would continue to challenge Zhang He.\u201d\u201cThe cultivation of these two differed by an entire realm. This kind of difference cannot be made up for with external objects. Unless he has a Heaven Ranked Martial Technique or a Divine Weapon.\u201d\u201cHeaven Ranked Martial Technique? Is that even possible? The Misty Sword Sect only has an Inferior Grade Heaven Ranked Martial Technique for their inheritance. How could the Xiao Clan have one?\u201d\u201cEven if there is one, with his cultivation realm, if he used it, it would be a suicidal move ending in mutual destruction.\u201dThe two people in the arena ignored all the sounds of discussions below. They went to the arena master and signed the agreement before starting the duel.The identity of the two were quite special. Furthermore, they had a grudge with each other. The arena master was afraid of an unsavory incident happening, thus, he went up and said, \u201cI shall say this just once: when one side has given up, the other side is absolutely not allowed to make a move. Or else, I shall take action personally.\u201dThis arena master may look ordinary but in actual fact, in Mohe City, anyone who dared to open an arena was at least a Martial Grand Master. Or else, it would be easy to find a person who could defeat the arena master, and then \u00a0there would not be any need for that arena to exist anymore.The two of them did not pay too much attention to the arena master\u2019s words. They were not stupid; they would definitely not kill each other. Or else, this might cause a war between their two clans. The most each would do would be to cripple the other\u2019s cultivation.In the arena, the two of them went to their allotted corners, gazing at each other and releasing their killing intent. They were waiting for a good opportunity before making a move.Their auras were clashing with each other in the air. Although their bodies were not moving, an invisible battle had been taking place long before. The thing that led Zhang He to be astonished was that Xiao Chen\u2019s aura was not weaker than his. He was actually not able to suppress Xiao Chen with his aura.The crowd below also felt that it was strange. With Xiao Chen\u2019s cultivation, he actually was able to resist Zhang He. Perhaps this duel would not be one-sided after all.\u201cEarlier, Xiao Jian, an Inferior Grade Martial Master, was not even able to touch the corner of my shirt. Do you think that you, a Medial Grade Martial Disciple, have a chance?\u201d Seeing that he was not able to use his aura to suppress Xiao Chen, he attempted to use words to demoralize him, hoping to cause him to show an opening.Xiao Chen was not a rash person like Xiao Jian; he knew what Zhang He was attempting to do. He replied in ridicule, \u201cWhen I was an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple, I was able to cause you to vomit blood. Now that I am a Medial Grade Martial Disciple, it would not be impossible for me to kill you.\u201dZhang He smiled indifferently, \u201cWho do you think you are? One of the descendants of the Holy Lands? Be able to defy the natural order and transcend cultivation realm? My Clear Sky Sword has yet to come out. To think you believe that you have such substance.\u201d\u201cWhether or not I possess such substance, you will know after we fight,\u201d Xiao Chen said coldly, deciding to make the first move.In the end, His cultivation differed from Zhang He\u2019s by an entire realm. If they kept confronting each other like this, it was likely that he would be the first to show an opening. When that happened, he might end up being killed in one move.Lightning Evasion!There was a clap of thunder as Xiao Chen abruptly appeared behind Zhang He. The Lunar Shadow Saber slashed across the air, leaving behind a black saber shadow, and rapidly hacked at Zhang He.In the instant Xiao Chen disappeared from his original spot, Zhang He already felt that something was wrong. After he heard the clap of thunder, he immediately knew Xiao Chen\u2019s location.He opened both his hands, bent his knees, and leaped up. He had already left the ground but there was actually the image of a huge roc behind him.\u201cThis is the technique that made the supreme elder of the Misty Sword Sect famous: Heavenly Roc Spreading Wings. According to the rumors, once it is practiced to the large success stage, it can allow the user to wander the four seas freely and fly for a thousand li in the time required to take a breath,\u201d a knowledgeable person below said.\u201cBecause of this movement technique, Xiao Jian was not able to touch even the corner of his shirt. I originally thought that the secret technique that Xiao Chen executed would be able to resolve this problem. Looks like it was not able to though,\u201d someone sighed.Zhang He, who leaped up, did not land on the ground again. He actually turned in a strange manner, as though he was a huge bird, flying towards Xiao Chen.Xiao Chen frowned slightly. He was feeling astonished in his heart. This Heavenly Roc Spreading Wings was indeed powerful. It was able to allow the user temporary flight. Looks like the rumors about it were true.\u201cBang!\u201dBefore he could think too much, as Zhang He\u2019s speed was extremely fast, the two of them clashed together.Xiao Chen\u2019s cultivation realm was lower than Zhang He\u2019s. Although he could rely on the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit for exceptionally majestic strength, and exhibit a strength that exceeds his body, he did not have a higher ranked Spirit Weapon. He was not able to completely exhibit the full extent of the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit. Thus, in a competition of strength, he was still slightly inferior to Zhang He.In addition to Zhang He, with the momentum of the Heavenly Roc Spreading Wings, was this sword of his, which contained a strength that bordered on the strength of a Martial Grand Master.When the sword and saber clashed, a huge force came from the sword. This caused Xiao Chen to not be able to withstand it and fly backward.The more problematic thing was the Qi of the Clear Sky Sword went into his body via the sword. The holy sword that existed in the ancient times turned into sword Qi and attacked his meridians; it was incredibly tyrannical.As he retreated, Xiao Chen attempted to resolve this terrifying sword Qi. Only when he reached the boundaries of the arena and had one leg in the air over the boundary lines, did he manage to dissipate the sword Qi.The foot still on the ground pushed off and he somersaulted in the air before landing firmly in the arena.Everyone cried out in surprise; they originally he would be sent flying out of the arena by Zhang He\u2019s sword. They did not expect him to manage to stay standing in the arena.However, there were many people who did not understand why Zhang He did not make a further move despite such a good opportunity. This way he could have made Xiao Chen fly out of the arena. Everyone in the crowd was discussing this.Hearing the discussion of the crowd, Zhang He was not able to explain his difficulties. Although his sword Qi had entered into Xiao Chen\u2019s body earlier, the electricity in Xiao Chen\u2019s saber had also entered into his body.The electricity generated by the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation was not much weaker than the Qi of his holy sword. If he did not dissipate it, it might result in a hidden damage in the latter part of the duel.\u201cAgain!\u201dAfter he completely dissipated the electricity, Zhang He shouted. That huge heavenly roc behind him actually let out a clear cry.His figure streaked across the air, leaving behind a shadow. A two-meter long sword light appeared on the body of his sword. Using that speed, coupled with a boundless aura, he flew towards Xiao Chen.\u201cThe heavenly roc actually cried out. This is the second layer of the Heavenly Roc Spreading Wings. To think at his young age, he was able to train this supreme secret art to the second layer.\u201d\u201cIndeed! How terrifying! According to rumors, the Sword Sage of Misty Sword Sect was able to make the heavenly roc give off a divine cry that was able to shatter the hearts and lungs of others without even making a move.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, this Zhang He activated the boundless might of the Clear Sky Sword. The holy sword combined with the heavenly roc. This time, Xiao Chen will be defeated.\u201dTowards the valiant Zhang He, the crowd below cried out in surprise again. With such strong might, everyone was sure that Xiao Chen stood no chance of winning.Even against a Martial Grand Master, Zhang He\u2019s move should be effective. Even the arena master\u2019s expression changed when he saw Zhang He exhibit the second layer of the Heavenly Roc Spreading Wings.Xiao Chen\u2019s expression was grave when he saw this sword flying towards him. He knew he could no longer hold back. He grasped the Lunar Shadow Saber in his hands and gently flipped it over.The Lunar Shadow Saber started to rotate rapidly. There was a turbulent surge of Qi engulfing outwards. This caused the surrounding people to feel their entire bodies tremble.Electrical light like that of a thunderbolt appeared on the body of the saber. Although it was already dusk, the sky actually seemed like it was lit up, as though it was daytime.However, what led people to be horrified was a tyrannical Qi coming from the saber. It was like the roar of a thunder beast, berserk and ferocious, and it felt like a magnificent army was arriving.\u201cThis is bad; this Spirit Weapon actually has a Demonic Core inlaid into it. It is probably a Martial King leveled Demonic Beast. Everyone Run! If the Demonic Qi was leaked, ordinary cultivators will bleed from their seven orifices and die.\u201d[TL notes: The seven orifices of the human head: 2 eyes, 2 ears, 2 nostrils, 1 mouth]\u201cHow terrifying! Within this insignificant Mohe city, a Spirit Weapon with a Demonic Core actually appeared.\u201dThe crowd ran in horror and scattered everywhere, but they did not go too far. They had stood far away looking excitedly at the duel taking place.The crowd had originally thought that with the Clear Sky Sword, it would be a one-sided battle in favor to Zhang He. They did not expect that Xiao Chen had a Demonic Weapon. Mohe City had not had such an exciting battle for a long time already, and naturally they could not miss this battle.The supreme movement technique, Heavenly Roc Spreading Wings, coupled with the ancient holy sword Clear Sky Sword, fiercely clashed against the Lunar Shadow Saber that had a Demonic Core of the Rank 6 Demonic Beast, Thunder Roc.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe Electrical light clashed with the sword light. A loud sound came from the arena, causing the crowd far away to feel like they went deaf. It was extremely terrifying.Blood was trickling from the corner of Xiao Chen\u2019s mouth. He took a heavy step backward\u2019 on the stone floor, a\u00a0one-meter deep\u00a0indentation of his foot was left. This showed how much pressure Xiao Chen had to withstand.Zhang He\u2019s body flew backward in the air. Using the Heavenly Roc Spreading Wings movement technique, he canceled out the force that came from the Lunar Shadow Saber.Zhang He\u2019s body landed gently on the ground. His clothes and hair were flying around in the wind. With his handsome face, Zhang he looked very elegant.This time, the two of them were on even ground no one held the advantage.Suppressing his surging Qi and blood, Zhang He\u2019s eyes looked calm. He no longer had the expression of looking down on his opponent. He smiled indifferently, \u201cI truly did not expect that you actually have such a Demonic Weapon. However, rare treasures belong to the elites. If that is all the skills you have, then this Demonic Weapon will be mine!\u201d\u201cShadow Bearing Sword!\u201dZhang He shouted loudly and threw out the sword in his hands. The shadow of a sword streaked through the sky. The Shadow Bearing Sword, that had been passed down in the Zhang Clan for hundreds of years, appeared in Zhang He\u2019s hands.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The history of this Shadow Bearing Sword was not simple, it was not an ordinary Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon.\u201d\u201cIt is not just rumors, it is true that it has an extraordinary origin. This Shadow Bearing Sword has a hidden Righteous Qi. According to the rumors, the ancestors of the Zhang Clan obtained it from a Sword Sage.\u201d\u201cThe Shadow Bearing Sword against the Lunar Shadow Saber. They are both not ordinary weapons. Who knows which one will be victorious.\u201d\u201cIs there even any need to ask this? It would definitely be Zhang He. His strength is greater than Xiao Chen\u2019s. Now that he has a good weapon helping him, how could he lose?\u201dThere had never been such a marvelous battle in Mohe City before. The crowd in the distance all saw Zhang He taking out the Shadow Bearing Sword. The sounds of discussion became even more lively.Xiao Chen wielded his saber and stood straight, his body as tall and straight as a pillar. The electrical light on the saber flashed continuously. There was a burning battle intent in his eyes. Even after Zhang He took out the Shadow Bearing Sword, there was not a shred of fear in him.Zhang He gently caressed the Shadow Bearing Sword as he said indifferently, \u201cThere is a Righteous Qi in the Shadow Bearing Sword. It was left behind by a Sword Sage that the Zhang Clan Ancestor had saved.\u201d\u201cBack then, the Sword Sage just comprehended the Righteous Qi. It was undefeatable in the four seas. Although there was only one strand of it in the sword, it could last for thousands of years. It will never dissipate. Dying by the blade of this sword today is your fortune.Righteous Qi?Xiao Chen smiled coldly in his heart. Although this Righteous Qi was very formidable, it was just an object from a holy land. The Battle Sage Origins that Ao Jiao left behind in the Lunar Shadow Saber was an object from the Thunder Emperor.The Thunder Emperor used this one-sixth portion of Battle Sage Origins to forge the Thunder Wood Sword. It was unclear how many holy men it had killed. If Zhang He wanted to think of that as his foundation, Xiao Chen would not mind giving him a surprise.Zhang He saw that there was no change to Xiao Chen\u2019s aura. He could not help but feel a little disappointed.\u00a0This Xiao Chen had a strong heart; no words were able to break his heart.His heart was not disturbed and his aura had not decreased. There was no clear weak point, making it difficult for him to make a move.Since there was no opening, then I will make an opening.\u00a0Zhang He thought, he was filled with a grand spirit. If he could not deal with a Medial Grade Martial Disciple today, there would be problems in future.He would definitely become the joke of the prefecture city\u2019s White Cliff School. It would become impossible for him to enter into a Holy Land. Thus he had to win this battle. Furthermore, it had to be a great triumph.A victory that could not be criticized, to make people feel convinced. To leave behind a stain on Xiao Chen that would be difficult for him to ever remove.Zhang He shouted explosively, and the Righteous Qi in the Shadow Bearing Sword completely came out. A heaven-shaking, earth-splitting, killing Qi spread all over the place. Before the sword made a move, the momentum of the sword was already established.Righteous Qi:It exists in the heaven and earth,it attacks as intended,punishing deities,and exterminating devils!Clear Sky Sword Qi:It follows my desires,its sword tip points at whatever I want,its Qi spread in all directions!Heavenly Roc Spreading Wings:It comes and leaves without a trace,as swift as the wind,as powerful as lightning!Kill! Kill! Kill![TL notes: This bit is kind of like a poem; each bit is four Chinese characters, except for the kill part.]In this instant, Zhang He actually merged three kinds of supreme attacks together. The Clear Sky Sword with a Righteous Qi, adding a supreme movement technique. Who would be able to defend against such a move!In that instant, like a squall rushing forth, a boundless killing intent rushed towards Xiao Chen. The sword in Zhang He\u2019s hand glowed with a resplendent sword light. A two-meter sword light took in and sent out a frantic sword Qi.\u201cPu Ci!\u201dXiao Chen had never seen such a fast sword, and in the previous instant Zhang He was still forming the sword light. Xiao Chen had not seen him raise his sword up, but in the next instant, the sword light had already arrived in front of his eyes.Xiao Chen was incomparably surprised in his heart. In this instant, he actually felt an aura of death. Since a long time ago, the biggest thing that he relied on was the Heaven Ranked Martial Technique\u2014Dragon Subduing Slash.Even if the situation was at its worst, as long as he used the Return of the Azure Dragon, even if there were ten Zhang He, they would all turn to ash.However, the situation in front of him was not good. Zhang He\u2019s speed was very fast, he probably did not have any chance to use the Return of the Azure Dragon before he was killed.At this moment, he did not have the time to think too much. The sword light had already come in contact with the hair on his head. If he still could not think of a solution, he would suffer a very serious injury.Since he did not have any opportunity to evade, then he could only clash head on.Heavenly Lightning Shield!It was a critical moment, during a time of life and death, so Xiao Chen used the Heavenly Lightning Shield.This Heavenly Lightning Shield was able to defend the attack of a Profound Ranked Martial Technique when he was an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple.At this moment, he had already become a Medial Grade Martial Disciple. His Essence became stronger by more than a fold. Thinking of the defense of the Heavenly Lightning Shield, it should have increased by more than a fold as well.\u201cBang!\u201dThe Sword Light clashed on the defensive shield of flickering electric light and gave off a loud resounding sound. A huge wave of energy came from it. Xiao Chen, who was hiding behind the shield, was jolted, his internal organs all shifted position. He once again vomited out a mouthful of blood.For a regular Martial Disciple, if his internal organs shifted, he probably would have lost his battle capabilities. However, Xiao Chen\u2019s body was tempered by a large amount of Spiritual Energy. In addition to the strength of the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation, he did not have to think too much about it. He was able to continue battling.Zhang He looked at the Heavenly Lightning Shield and frowned slightly. He did not know what kind of strong defensive technique this was. The slight crack on the shield was actually starting to slowly mend.To hell with whatever strong defensive technique that was. In front of the Righteous Qi, you shall all break!\u201cFlights On Wings, One Line Chop.\u201dZhang He shouted lightly, his whole body seemed to have merged with the sword to become one. The glow of this sword was reserved. There did not seem to be any color, sword Qi, or wind.This understated sword chopped onto Xiao Chen\u2019s Heavenly Lightning Shield. It did not make any sound but the electrical light of the shield was diminishing rapidly. Xiao Chen suffered a heavy blow and vomited another mouthful of blood.His hands rapidly formed hand seals. Two of the five clouds beside the Azure Dragon dissipated, turning into countless strands of Essence, and entering the Heavenly Lightning Shield. The glow on the shield turned bright once again.\u201cFlights On Wings, Disordered Dance of a Thousand Years.\u201dZhang He did not feel discouraged and used another strong sword technique. Comparing it to the previous move, this move was far more gorgeous and powerful.The boundless sword Qi was like the squalls amidst the autumn wind. They attacked the Heavenly Lightning Shield. Zhang He\u2019s figure rapidly changed positions. Each time he changed position, there would be twenty strands of sword Qi attacking the Heavenly Lightning Shield.He had changed positions many times in the air, as he sent out a total of 1620 strands of sword Qi. Each strand of sword Qi had half the might of the One Line Chop.Xiao Chen persistently maintained the Heavenly Lightning Shield, but blood kept pouring out from his mouth. However, he did not have any intention of giving up. He released his Spiritual Sense to figure out where Zhang He\u2019s position was and watched the gracefulness of his move.Even though he was severely injured, and with a huge disadvantage, his heart was not in disorder. His aura had not decreased, and he still did not show any openings.\u201cFlights On Wings: I recall that this was a martial technique that was created by a Sword Sage that had left the White Cliff School. To think that Zhang He actually learned it. Although it is only the first two moves, it was enough for him to show disdain for those of the same generation as him.\u201d\u201cThat Xiao Chen is not simple either, under the combined power of the Righteous Qi and Clear Sky Sword Qi, he is able to persist until now.\u201cZhang He actually had not truly merged the Heavenly Roc Spreading Wings, Righteous Qi, and Clear Sky Sword Qi. It is just form without essence. Or else, that sword would be able to easily kill a peak Martial Grand Master.\u201cLook at Zhang He; it looks like he is about to use the third move of the Flights On Wings. Is that even possible, that he comprehended three moves of the Flights On Wings at such a young age?\u201dThe crowd in the distance cried out in surprise. This duel today had opened their eyes. Not only Zhang He, but Xiao Chen had also given everyone an unexpected surprise.\u201cFlights On Wings, Moon Bright Like Fire.\u201dRegardless of the astonishment of the crowd, this third move of the Flights On Wings, Moon Bright Like Fire, was still executed by Zhang He.On the Arena, Zhang He stood 20 meters away from Xiao Chen. His sword was pointing toward the heavens. The evening sky suddenly turned incomparably pitch black. A full moon slowly rose, the luminous moon brightly illuminated the sky.\u201cTo think mysterious phenomena appeared. What rank of Martial Technique is this Flights On Wings? Why is it so terrifying?\u201d No one had expected that the third move of the Flights On Wings could cause mysterious phenomena to appear.Above the full moon, a faintly discernable figure appeared holding a Spirit Sword in his hands. It looked as though he came from the heavens. With the full moon enhancing his looks, that faintly discernable figure felt like a deity descending to the earth.Zhang He, who was in the arena, brandished his sword gently. The figure in the sky followed his movements. Suddenly, he pointed his sword at Xiao Chen, who was behind the Heavenly Lightning Shield.Xiao Chen felt as though his heart stopped beating. The space surrounding him turned dark. Everyone seemed to have disappeared. There was no Zhang He, no arena master, no crowd. There was only a boundless darkness and a loneliness that spread everywhere.This was a terrifying feeling. Those who were not in it would not understand how it felt. Xiao Chen\u2019s heart was frantic and was about to make a move.Just at this moment, the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit in his body roared gently. The pitch dark space immediately shattered and space returned to how it was before. Xiao Chen finally calmed down.Zhang He raised his eyebrows. He had obviously felt that Xiao Chen\u2019s heart was wavering. Yet, he suddenly calmed down. However, he could not afford to think too much at this moment. The moon had already risen high in the sky, he could no longer stop.\u201cBreak for me!\u201dZhang He shouted loudly, his sword was pointing furiously at Xiao Chen. The figure in the sky seemed to have felt Zhang He\u2019s anger and shouted at the same time, \u201cBreak for me!\u201d\u201cBreak!\u201d\u201cBreak!\u201d\u201cBreak!\u201dIn that instant, the surroundings were full of Zhang He\u2019s angry shouts. A powerful pressure was spread everywhere. There seemed to be a might contained in that voice, causing people to feel terrified.\u201cThis is a deity\u2019s voice... this Moon Bright Like Fire can actually give off a deity's voice.\u201dA cultivator with low strength amongst the crowd in the distance was directly knocked unconsciousness by this deity\u2019s voice. Even the cultivators there who were slightly stronger felt uneasy.\u201cThe deity\u2019s voice is already so terrifying, how powerful would the following sword move be?\u201d Someone amongst the crowd in the distance said with a trembling voice.Xiao Chen\u2019s heart was as calm as still water. The supreme cultivation method in the Compendium of Cultivation, Purple Thunder Divine Incantation, was circulating frantically. His Essence was being used unsparingly. A faint purple glow was actually given off by his body.Zhang He stood at his original spot; he did not move at all and just pointed his sword at Xiao Chen. Then he chopped downwards from 20 meters away.What is he doing? Even if he is a Martial Saint, after the sword Qi flew out for 20 meters its might would be greatly diminished. This will not help him to break my Heavenly Lightning Shield.Xiao Chen was very puzzled as he thought about this. He raised his head before revealing an expression of overwhelming shock. He finally understood what Zhang He was doing.The figure in the moon actually imitated Zhang He\u2019s move, and ruthlessly chopped at him.Moon Bright Like Fire:Bright light in the sky,man from the heavens,sword of the deities,the mortals are like ants,who can defend against it?[TL notes: This bit is kind of like a poem, each bit is four Chinese characters]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 61:\u00a0One Move Destroying a Thousand TechniquesThere was a loud explosive sound, and the corner of the arena that Xiao Chen stood on was blasted to smithereens. Rocks flew everywhere and dust filled the air. The arena that was forged from Heavenly Mountain Stones had a two-meter deep pit in it, causing people to exclaim in astonishment.\u201cThis Moon Bright Like Fire is very terrifying. It could actually blast a pit into this arena that is forged from Heavenly Mountain Stones.\u201d\u201cThe future of this fellow is limitless. Back then, that Sword Sage from White Cliff School managed to kill a Martial Emperor with one stroke of his sword.\u201d\u201cIndeed, the Zhang Clan\u2019s rise to power can clearly be seen now. After this battle, the rankings of the powers in Mohe City will thoroughly change.\u201d\u201cDo you think that this Xiao Chen is able to withstand this move?\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense! Do we still need to say this? There is a large pit in the Heavenly Mountain Stone. I\u2019m guessing it is very possible that his corpse was blasted into oblivion. How unfortunate for that exceptional Demonic Weapon.\u201dWhen Zhang He used the Flight On Wings, Moon Bright Like Fire, the crowd in the distance thought that the battle had ended. Although it felt like they had not fully expressed themselves yet, this battle had been a big eye opener for them. It was sufficient for them to brag about in the future.The radiance dispersed and the moonlight shone down. Zhang He was flying amongst the wind, and his eyes were as calm as still water. That move had exhausted a great amount of his Essence, and the Clear Sky Sword\u2019s source of power. If he still had not destroyed that Heavenly Lightning Shield, then he would have no other methods left.However, was that even a possibility?It was obvious that there was none. The corners or Zhang He\u2019s mouth curled up in a cold smile. He held the Shadow Bearing Sword and headed over to the pit. His footsteps were light and his expression was relaxed. However, he did not let down his guard even by a little bit.With Xiao Chen\u2019s insignificant Medial Grade Martial Disciple cultivation, he had managed to give him too many surprises. This made it difficult for his heart to remain calm. He absolutely could not relax... not until the final moment.At the bottom of that huge pit, Xiao Chen\u2019s clothes were already torn to shreds. He looked like a dead man lying on the floor.Both his eyes were closed; there were bloodstains at the corners of his eyes, and there was blood flowing from his nose and mouth. He seemed to be tightly grasping on to something in his left hand. The Lunar Shadow Saber was stuck into the ground near his right hand.Zhang He breathed out in relief. Regardless of how he looked, Xiao Chen was covered in severe injuries everywhere. He definitely would not be able to continue to battle.Smiling gently, Zhang He jumped down and walked to the Lunar Shadow Saber. He said indifferently, \u201cI, Zhang He, shall be receiving this Demonic Weapon.\u201dJust as his hand was about to come in contact with the saber handle, Xiao Chen\u2019s right hand suddenly moved and pointed at Zhang He. His tightly closed eyes suddenly opened.There was a scarlet glow coming from his eyes and a strange smile on his face. It seemed to complement his bloodstained face, making him looked very terrifying.Zhang He paid attention and he felt a dangerous aura. He immediately used the Flight On Wings. At this moment, he executed the Flight On Wings to its extremes. A man flying like a large bird instantly returned to the top of the arena.Behind him, there was a strand of purple flames; it was moving like a python, sticking very close to him. If he was just slightly slower, he would be caught by these purple flames. The consequences would be unimaginable.The purple flame brushed by his side from behind, and a shower of sparks fell onto his hair. In an instant, there was a burning smell. Half his elegant long hair was actually burnt off.Zhang He circulated his Essence and his hair immediately stood erect. The purple flames on the erect hair slowly moved downwards. It would arrive at his head in the next instant.\u201cShua!\u201dZhang He decisively used his sword to cut off his burning hair. It was completely cut off. The erect hair all fell downwards.The originally elegant hair all disappeared, leaving behind some partially dried up stray hair and a burnt smell.At this moment, Zhang He\u2019s expression looked extremely unsightly. He was the expression of one who had just drunk urine. This was probably how Zhang He felt at the moment.The crowd in the distance had seen Zhang He jump down in a magnificent manner. They all thought that he would be coming out with the Lunar Shadow Saber in hand, ending this duel.After a moment, they were astonished to discover that Zhang He was fleeing in a sorry manner, and his hair seemed to be set ablaze. After that, his expression was very unsightly, akin to one that had drunk urine. No one could figure out what had happened in there.\u201cDid you guys feel that? The Qi and blood of the person below seemed to be flourishing.\u201d\u201cYes! I felt it too. This seems to be the usual scenario of what happens before a breakthrough.\u201d\u201cImpossible! Could it be that after surviving a great ordeal, his cultivation realm is actually going to be raised to Superior Grade Martial Disciple?\u201dWithin the pit, Xiao Chen completely absorbed the inferior grade Spirit Stone in his left hand. He then casually tossed it aside; that Spirit Stone had already lost all its glow, and it now seemed like any ordinary rock, no longer of any value.He felt that the effects of the Blood Replenishing Pill he had eaten earlier had already dispersed. Xiao Chen heaved a sigh of relief.Moon Bright Like Fire was too scary. Even his Heavenly Lightning Shield, that was comparable to an Earth Ranked Martial Technique, was useless and had been torn like paper in front of it.That figure in the sky was like a deity descending to earth. With the might of one sword, he broke through the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation that was protecting his body, causing him to bleed from his seven orifices.If he had not placed a Blood Replenishing Pill in his mouth earlier, even with the Heavenly Lightning Shield and Purple Thunder Divine Incantation protecting his body, he would no longer have the strength to stand up.He spread his Spiritual Sense out and saw Zhang He standing on top of the arena. The corner of Xiao Chen\u2019s lips curled up in a cold smile. He took out another pill from his Universe Ring.This was the Cloud Swallowing Pill; after consuming it, within a short period of time, it would raise the strength of the user by multiple folds. It was extremely terrifying.After he absorbed the Inferior Grade Spirit Stone, Xiao Chen easily reached the peak Great Perfection of Superior Grade Martial Disciple. He immediately swallowed the Cloud Swallowing Pill and his strength immediately soared to that of a Medial Grade Martial Master.At this moment, Xiao Chen\u2019s absolute strength was comparable to that of Zhang He\u2019s. With the assistance of the Azure Dragon, he was not inferior in any aspects.The crowd in the distance could only feel that Xiao Chen\u2019s strength was continually rising up. Zhang He, who was on the stage, could feel the aura that was pressing on him ruthlessly, and each wave that surged up was stronger than the one before.\u201cBoom!\u201dXiao Chen stomped on the ground and leaped up fiercely, standing in the arena once again. The electrical glow of the Lunar Shadow Saber was very bright, and a boundless, vicious Qi filled the entire area. He felt like the devil of hell.This was the first time a grave expression appeared on Zhang He\u2019s face.\u00a0It was possible for him to be defeated by the blade of this saber,\u00a0he could not help thinking in his heart.\u201cFlight On Wings, One Line Chop!\u201dZhang He could no longer tolerate the pressure of the vicious Qi. He took the initiative to attack. His move was very simple and his sword light reserved. His sword, that had a boundless might, worked together with his movement technique Flight On Wings and chopped ruthlessly at Xiao Chen.Xiao Chen smiled coldly; earlier he had been observing Zhang He\u2019s movements.Now that his strength had risen, the movement technique that Zhang He was so proud of could easily be traced in Xiao Chen\u2019s eyes, instantly seeing through his movements.\u201cFlight On Wings, One Line Chop!\u201dZhang He was astonished... Xiao Chen was actually using the same sword technique as him. It was the same sword that was very simple and also had a reserved sword light.Xiao Chen initiated the move later than Zhang He, but arrived earlier. He avoided Zhang He\u2019s attack, and instead, struck towards his heart.\u201cHow\u2026 How could this be? How does he know Flight On Wings? He only took a look,\u201d Zhang He said, extremely astonished, and with his mental state in disarray.He was very clear on the might of the One Line Chop; he quickly pulled his sword back and tried to defend, intending to block it with his sword.He had studied the sword techniques of Flight On Wings, and was very familiar with it. After that instant of panic, he quickly thought of a way to block it.His feet moved slightly and he held his sword horizontally in front of his chest, protecting his heart. He had accurately calculated Xiao Chen\u2019s angle of attack.\u201cDang!\u201dWhen the sword and saber clashed, there was a clear, metallic ringing sound. The huge force that came from Lunar Shadow exceeded Zhang He\u2019s expectations.The swift and fierce attacking Qi instantly caused his perfect footwork to be broken. The Lunar Shadow Saber, which had a Rank 6 Demonic Core in it, had a torrential and unceasing electrical glow coming from it.It went through his Shadow Bearing Sword and entered into his body. The electrical glow, which was filled with a ruthless energy, entered into Zhang He\u2019s body. It charged around violently, blocking up all his Essence and instantly causing all it \u00a0to crumble apart.\u201cPu!\u201dThere was a sweetness in his mouth as Zhang He vomited out blood. His body flew backward by five steps.His gaze was full of astonishment as he looked at Xiao Chen. He said in disbelief, \u201cYou actually merged the Flight On Wings and One Line Chop into your own saber technique! How is this possible?!\u201d\u201cFlight On Wings, Disordered Dance of a Thousand Years.\u201dXiao Chen did not reply Zhang He\u2019s words, and used the second move of Flight On Wings. His body rapidly switched position in the air as streams of saber light were fired at Zhang He.\u201cCriss-crossed Sword Qi!\u201dZhang He shouted loudly and used the technique that had dissolved the Divine Thunder Break earlier. This move could be used for attacking or defending. It was a Martial Technique that he was very proud of.Countless sword Qi protected Zhang He\u2019s surroundings. They were flying around randomly, dense enough to not let wind through, blocking all attacks outside.Xiao Chen did not have a Holy Sword Martial Spirit, so naturally, he could not use sword Qi as a Martial master.Thus, he used the Changing Character Formula of the Battle Sage Origins to imitate the Disordered Dance of a Thousand Years. However, he was still not able to fire any sword Qi, and he could only fire saber lights made from Essence.Even so, with the unrivaled attacking Qi of the Battle Sage Origins, any defensive Martial Techniques would reveal openings. Furthermore, Xiao Chen had the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit, and the might of his saber light was not inferior to Zhang He\u2019s sword Qi by much.After Zhang He\u2019s Criss-crossed Sword Qi blocked a thousand saber lights, it was completely defeated. The remaining 200 odd saber lights struck Zhang he\u2019s body without restraint.Zhang He cried out painfully, groaning non-stop. The fine clothes that he was wearing were shredded under the saber lights, turning them into rags. There were hundreds of bleeding wounds on his body.\u201cBang!\u201dAfter the Disordered Dance of a Thousand Years was finished, Xiao Chen, who was about to descend, kicked out while he was high in the sky. Zhang He was kicked to the ground. After performing a somersault, Xiao Chen landed firmly on the ground.\u201cDon\u2019t think that by using a secret technique and raising your cultivation realm to the same as mine, then learning my Flight on Wings, I would not be able to do anything to you,\u201d Zhang He, who was on the ground, said to Xiao Chen ruthlessly.\u201cHoly Sword, Clear Sky Sword!\u201dHe used his finger as a sword and pointed at Xiao Chen. A resplendent Holy Sword appeared in front, glowing with a golden light. It caused the sky to light up, filling everywhere with a warm yellow \u00a0glow.\u201cThis is the Holy Sword Origin. He actually used the origin of the Clear Sky Sword Martial Spirit!\u201d\u201cIndeed, how risky! If the Holy Sword broke, then his cultivation would be crippled forever, turning him into trash.\u201dThe astonishment of the crowd rang out again. Zhang He was actually betting his cultivation against Xiao Chen.\u201cFlight On Wings, Moon Bright Like Fire.\u201dXiao Chen gazed at Zhang He with serenity, the Battle Sage Origins slowly imitating the third move of Flight On Wings. The mysterious phenomena appeared again.The sky turned pitch dark and a full moon rose up again, however, this full moon did not have the same figure. Only a full moon hung in the sky, spreading its radiance everywhere.As to why the \u201cdeity\u201d did not appear, Xiao Chen understood in his heart. It was because his comprehension of the way of the sword was insufficient. He was only able to imitate the form of this Moon Bright Like Fire, not its essence.However, Xiao Chen had his methods. Battle Sage Origins was the strongest attacking Qi under the heavens, and no one could defend against it. Since he was not able to use the intricacies of the sword, then he would replace it with absolute might and use one saber move to decided everything.The Saber slashed down and the full moon in the sky slowly descended, falling ruthlessly towards the Clear Sky Holy Sword in Zhang He\u2019s hand!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This Moon Bright Like Fire was much more powerful than Zhang He\u2019s earlier one. The large arena was blasted into countless pieces.Chunks fired out in all directions from the huge shockwave. Some of the closest crowd members were struck by fragments. They suffered severe injuries, their Qi and blood turning turbulent as a result. It was a truly unexpected calamity.Due to a dense dust cloud filling the arena, people in the back of the crowd were unable to see the action. Their anxiety was palpable.\u201cWhat a strong Moon Bright Like Fire; it was more mighty than what Zhang He exhibited.\u201d\u201cThere is dust everywhere! Who in the world won?\u201dAlthough the crowd was nervous to know the result, they were also afraid of possible accidents. They did not dare move closer to the arena. Those injured by the stone pieces were a living example.After a long time, the dust cloud finally dispersed and the crowd could clearly see the situation in the arena.That two-meter high arena, made of Heavenly Mountain Stones, no longer existed; only rubble remained. Zhang He was lying on the ground, and it was unclear whether or not he was alive. The Shadow Bearing Sword had disappeared.The arena master at the side of the arena had an indescribably dispirited expression on his face. His arena, built up bitterly and his sole source of revenue, was gone. Although he received ten percent of the wager as a commission, it was not enough to compensate for his loss.Everything was clear now, and everyone knew the results; Xiao Chen won this duel. As only a Medial Grade Martial Disciple, he defeated the Medial Grade Martial Master, Zhang He.Mohe City would be shocked by this news, and it would travel far within the Qizi County. Xiao Chen actually managed to defeat Zhang He, despite a gap of an entire cultivation realm. This was an explosive news.Xiao Chen\u2019s reputation as Mohe City\u2019s trash was thoroughly eliminated by this battle. Everyone now believed that a genius had appeared.While everyone was discussing this, there was one person standing there with a complex expression in his eyes. It was Xiao Chen\u2019s elder brother, Xiao Jian.There was an inner core in Xiao Jian\u2019s hands: the inner core of a Rainbow Flame Python. Before Xiao Chen left, he threw it over to Xiao Jian.He really wanted to throw it away because he didn\u2019t want Xiao Chen\u2019s pity. However, he couldn\u2019t bear to do it....Three days later, within the Xiao Clan Residence.\u201cSecond Young Master, the First Elder sent someone again to request your presence.\u00a0Should I put him off like the previous times?\u201d Bao`er said in a gentle voice as they conversed in Xiao Chen\u2019s courtyard.Xiao Chen recovered from his cultivation state. He smiled bitterly in his heart,\u00a0There is no need to be so anxious, calling me tens of times in the past three days.The effects of the Cloud Swallowing Pill wore off shortly after the duel that day. The side effects of the medicinal pill immediately followed.Xiao Chen rushed back after taking the Shadow Bearing Sword, afraid of assassination attempts. He was worried the Cloud Swallowing Pill side effects would leave him vulnerable.He remained inside for the past three days,refining the remnants of the Cloud Swallowing Pill\u2019s medicinal effects in his body. The duel provided him many insights.Xiao Chen rejected all visitors, refusing interruption. He was only now able to refine the medicinal effects of the Cloud Swallowing Pill. Although he comprehended many insights from the battle, he was not yet able to fully grasp them. He must wait to manage them in the future.The First Elder would absolutely send someone to barge in if he didn\u2019t go now.\u00a0Thinking this, Xiao Chen said toward the door, \u201cBao`er, go let them know I\u2019m coming out soon.\u201dHe straightened his clothes and considered what he would say to the First Elder. Xiao Chen opened the door, took a deep breath, and slowly made his way to the First Elder\u2019s courtyard.Along the way, he ran into some Xiao Clan disciples. Their expressions when they saw him were completely changed. He used to hear slanderous rumors, but now he heard nothing. Everyone appeared to harbor a deep respect for him.The attitude of these young disciples never bothered him before. He went forward with great strides, arriving at Xiao Qiang\u2019s courtyard after a short while.Xiao Qiang and Xiao Yulan sat on opposite sides of a stone table within the courtyard. Xiao Yulan still looked very pretty, and every time someone saw her it caused arousal.\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, after becoming famous you want to start playing games with people? Even refusing to see your cousin?\u201d when Xiao Yulan saw Xiao Chen coming over, she mocked him in a teasing manner.Xiao Chen bowed to the First Elder first before taking a seat, \u201cCousin Yulan, I am sorry for that. I was recuperating from my injuries over the past few days. Thus, it was inconvenient for me to see anyone.\u201dWhen Xiao Yulan saw Xiao Chen sincerely apologizing she hurriedly said, \u201cI was just teasing you; everyone knows that you are recuperating.\u201dEver since Xiao Chen entered, Xiao Qiang\u2019s gaze was fixed on Xiao Chen\u2019s body and had not left him at all. He immediately continued with the current topic, \u201cSecond Young Master, are there any remaining problems with your body? There are some Rank 7 herbs in the Xiao Clan\u2019s dispensary. Don\u2019t try to shoulder everything by yourself.\u201dSince the Xiao Clan had managed the Seven Horn Mountain for hundreds of years, it was not strange for them to have some Rank 7 herbs. Xiao Chen said, \u201cThere are no longer any major problems. Many thank to First Elder for the concern.\u201d\u201cIn that case, I can relax. I won\u2019t have to worry about the Trial of Gloomy Forest that happens in two days,\u201d Xiao Qiang said and changed the topic, \u201cCan you tell me the details of what you obtained in the Thunder Emperor\u2019s cave?\u201dMost people were unable to understand why Xiao Chen was suddenly exploding with a valiant fighting strength. However, Xiao Qiang easily related it to the Cave of the Thunder Emperor.Xiao Chen\u2019s expression did not change; he long ago expected the First Elder to ask this question. He placed the Lunar Shadow Saber on the table and said, \u201cThis was the Thunder Wood Sword used by the Thunder Emperor. I reforged it into a Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon. I have obtained the inheritance of the Thunder Emperor from it.\u201dXiao Chen\u2019s words were shrouded in\u00a0half-truths, but there were no gaps in his story. Following that, he lied about how he acquired the Thunder Emperor\u2019s inheritance; Xiao Qiang listened to the story and appeared to believe it.He said to Xiao Chen cautiously, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone else about this, . or else you will drown in a sea of calamities. This matter is very significant. Who knows, maybe this will cause our Xiao Clan to begin a big undertaking.\u201dThe Thunder Emperor was the most famous Martial Emperor in the past thousand years. His fame in the continent was spread very wide, entering deeply into the people\u2019s heart.Many people dreamt about receiving his inheritance. If they knew Xiao Chen had obtained the Thunder Emperor\u2019s inheritance,\u00a0then\u00a0Xiao Chen would be chased relentlessly.Xiao Yulan picked up the Lunar Shadow Saber on the table and observed it before saying in praise, \u201cThis saber is truly Cousin\u2019s lucky item. Back then, it helped us escape from that pit. Now, it helped Cousin receive the Thunder Emperor\u2019s inheritance. It\u2019s truly a good saber.\u201dXiao Chen smiled in his heart. Although his Cousin Yulan had an innate gift for combat, her thoughts were still so simple. Such a strong Demonic Weapon, and yet twice she used the word lucky to describe it.He suddenly thought of something. He took out the Shadow Bearing Sword from his Universe Ring and handed it to Xiao Yu Lan, \u201cCousin Yulan, back then, you let me take all of the Moonstones. I\u2019m giving you this Shadow Bearing Sword as compensation for that.\u201dXiao Yulan smiled when she heard that, \u201cI do not dare accept this sword. The clan head of the Zhang Clan has come here many times in the past few days. He wants the sword back.\u201d\u201cWe absolutely cannot let them buy it back. This is something we obtained fairly; how can we just let it go just like that?\u201d Xiao Chen said, \u201cThis Shadow Bearing Sword was forged from superior quality Frost Iron.\u201dFurthermore, it contained some Righteous Qi. However, because they didn\u2019t infuse a large amount of Moonstones into it when it was forged, its rank was lower. In actual fact, its value was quite high.Honestly speaking, Xiao Chen felt reluctant to give it to Xiao Yulan. After he cultivated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation to the second layer, he was considering forging a protective treasure.However, he was unable to do it since he lacked the necessary materials. He believed he could forge a decent quality treasure if he kept the sword.If it was sold back to the Zhang Clan, it would be a big loss for Xiao Chen.Xiao Yulan saw Xiao Chen\u2019s anxious look and smiled tactfully. Her face looked as pretty as flowers, and she did not have her usual icy expression. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your father has the same intentions as you. We won\u2019t return the things we\u2019ve obtained. So long as it is something you gave me, I would dare to use it.\u201dXiao Chen blushed with shame,\u00a0Cousin Yulan\u2019s personality seemed to have changed significantly. It was totally different from the cold personality that would push people thousands of li away that he saw when they first met.She had even made jokes twice.\u00a0Unfortunately, he was unable to tell she was joking; he was not able to understand the way girls thought.\u00a0Joking with people\u2026 that would depend on who it is.If the other disciples of the Xiao Clan saw this famous, icy beauty of the Xiao Clan chatting with Xiao Chen happily, they would be very astonished.The three of them them chatted for a long time about Trial of Gloomy Forest matters during which Xiao Qing shared his experiences of participating in the Trial of Gloomy Forest with the two of them without hesitation.Something unexpected happened to Xiao Chen when he left. The First Elder asked about Xiao Chen\u2019s Martial Spirit again. Furthermore, he requested to personally inspect it.This caused the suspicions that Xiao Chen had in his heart long ago to resurface,\u00a0Could it be that the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit had some unspeakable secrets?When Xiao Qiang\u2019s consciousness entered into Xiao Chen\u2019s body, Xiao Chen hid the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit in the white clouds. Then, he used his Spiritual Sense to imitate a clump of purple flame. Through this, he barely managed to hide it from Xiao Qiang.Xiao Chen kept thinking about his suspicions; he laid on his bed pondering it..Why was the First Elder so mindful of his Martial Spirit? Xiao Chen\u2019s Azure Dragon Martial Spirit had not appeared for a thousand years. It was not surprising for them to be a little cautious.However, Xiao Chen thought he felt fear from the First Elder\u2019s attitude; a fear of the Azure Dragon. Every time he verified that the Martial Spirit in his body was not the Azure Dragon, the expression on the First Elder\u2019s face became more relaxed.What secrets\u00a0was\u00a0this Azure Dragon Martial Spirit hiding?Just then, Xiao Bai came out of the Spirit Blood Jade that Xiao Chen wore on the front of his chest. It looked all around for Ao Jiao; its anxious appearance was extremely adorable.Xiao Chen looked at Xiao Bai and revealed a smiled. Every time this fellow came out, it looked for Ao Jiao. When it could not find her, it looked at Xiao Chen with pitiful eyes.Xiao Chen knew that this fellow had gotten addicted to the energy it had eaten that day. However, Ao Jiao was sealed in the Lunar Shadow Saber. Xiao Chen did not know when he would see her again.Thinking of this, Xiao Chen could not help feeling somewhat depressed. Without that young lass around, it felt like something was missing.Hugging Xiao Bai, Xiao Chen began infusing some Essence into its body, circulating the Mysterious Nine Heavenly Revolution Transformation cultivation method through it.He began doing this three days after he came back. The earlier the Spirit Beast started to cultivate, the better. Xiao Bai was a naturally born Rank 6 Spirit Beast. It would be a great support for Xiao Chen in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 64": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63:\u00a0Gloomy ForestThere were only two more days to the Trial of Gloomy Forest. Xiao Chen did not go out like before. During the day he continued to ponder upon the comprehensions that he had from dueling with Zhang He, while cultivating the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation at night.Xiao Chen felt he had already touched the margins of the Changing Character Formula of the Battle Sage Origins. However, after he came back he wanted to use Flight on Wings, but he was not able to do it despite several attempts.Xiao Chen thought about it persistently. One of the main reasons he was able to use Flight on Wings smoothly that day was that his body was in desperate straits after getting struck by that Moon Bright Like Fire, activating his body\u2019s potential.Another reason could be because he ate the Cloud Swallowing Pill and raised his strength by an extreme amount, much stronger than his current realm.Regardless, whichever it was, it caused Xiao Chen to be filled with anticipation for the Trial of Gloomy Forest. Only by putting himself in a desperate situation in a dangerous place, in a situation of life and death, only then could he understand the quintessence of the Battle Sage Origins\u2019 Changing Character Formula.Only through continuous combat would the strength of his body rise. Entering into secluded cultivation was not a good solution for that.Two days later the trial was held as scheduled. The First Elder lead Xiao Chen and a group of people to the plaza in the center of the city. The three great clans, and others, would gather there.Then, under the leadership of Mohe City\u2019s City Lord, they would rush to the edge of Gloomy Forest and begin the trial.This time, there were ten people from the Xiao Clan taking part in the Trial. Everyone was at least a Superior Grade Martial Disciple. Xiao Jian and Xiao Yulan were both Martial Masters. They were definitely the strongest amongst the three great clans.When they arrived at the plaza, the people of the Tang Clan and Zhang Clan had already arrived. The looks the two clans gave the Xiao Clan were not very friendly. They had both recently suffered some disadvantages at the hands of the Xiao Clan. A new hatred piled onto the old hatred, and they wished they could just beat up the Xiao Clan now.There was a stone platform in the middle of the plaza. The City Lord had not arrived yet. Xiao Chen and Xiao Yulan had a casual conversation with each other, so, they were not bored. They were thinking that the City Lord was keeping others waiting in order to show off his status.\u201cYou must be Xiao Chen.\u201dAs the two of them were chatting, suddenly, someone walked over from the side. Xiao Yulan looked at the person and frowned slightly. She said in a soft voice, \u201cIt\u2019s the Tang Clan\u2019s people.\u201dThrough his Spiritual Sense, Xiao Chen saw the person\u2019s appearance clearly. He was not surprised; he merely turned around and smiled, \u201cI am, indeed. I wonder what business Brother Tang Feng has with me?\u201dWhen Tang Feng heard Xiao Chen call out his name, he felt it was strange. Tang Feng\u2019s expressions changed, \u201cNothing much. Brother Xiao has become famous recently; everyone in Mohe City knows about you. I just want to make friends with you.\u201dXiao Yulan smiled coldly, \u201cMake friends? Your elder brother Tang Yuan died on our Seven Horn Mountain. Instead of seeking revenge, you want to make friends?\u201dAfter Tang Feng heard that, the smile on his face grew wider, \u201cThat fellow was always going against me. Now that he has died at Brother Xiao\u2019s hands, it serves him right. This is something that I should be thanking Brother Xiao for, so why would I be thinking of revenge?\u201dTang Feng\u2019s heart was full of schemes. For the position of clan head, he had fought with his brother. This was a normal occurrence since ancient times, and it was not unusual. However, Xiao Chen knew about him since that time in Linlang Pavilion. He knew what kind of personality he had. Why would he trust his words now?Xiao Jian\u2019s complexion changed when he heard Tand Feng\u2019s words; it was unclear what he was thinking about.Xiao Chen walked in front of Tang Feng and spoke softly into his ear, \u201cThat Inferior Grade Spirit Stone in Linlang Pavilion was purchased by me. Do you still want to be friends with me?\u201dTang Feng\u2019s expression changed greatly, and his earlier smile fled. He had a grave look on his face as he said, \u201cThe person who interfered with my matters time and time again was actually you! Don\u2019t be too cocky. It is best you don\u2019t go to the Gloomy Forest. If you enter, you will not be walking back out.\u201dHe flung his sleeves back and scoffed coldly before leaving.Xiao Chen had an unsettling feeling in his heart.\u00a0Given what Tang Feng said, could there be a deathtrap waiting for me in this Gloomy Forest?\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, what did you say to that person to cause your complexion to be so unsightly?\u201d Xiao Yulan asked out of curiosity. The other Xiao Clan disciples were looking curiously at him as well.Xiao Chen smiled, \u201cI told him that the rheum in his eye is not properly cleaned. Coming out to speak to people like that is very rude.\u201d[TL notes: \u00a0Rheum is the \u201ceye wax\u201d at the corner of your eye when you wake up.]The crowd all laughed when they heard it; only Xiao Chen had a shadow left in his heart. He could not let it go, but there was no choice. He must go into the Gloomy Forest.Screw it! I\u2019ll deal with it when it happens. I\u2019ll be ready for it. Thinking about it now will just increase my frustrations,\u00a0Xiao Chen consoled himself.At this moment, the crowd suddenly became noisy. Xiao Chen looked up and saw it was the City Lord Dugu Feng finally arriving. This was the most powerful man in Mohe City. Xiao Chen was very curious; he sent out his Spiritual Sense, but discovered he could not see through the City Lord\u2019s strength.He was astonished. Thinking about it, as the City Lord his cultivation must be astonishing. Xiao Chen simply did not expect that it was so great he could not see through it.The City Lord gave a few words of encouragement and then gave some instructions to the men behind him. A few small dots immediately appeared in the sky. As one of the black dots flew nearer, it became clearly visible. It was a huge Flying Spirit Beast\u2014Curtain Bat.This was a bat-type mutated bird. It had no feathers on its body, and instead it had sleek black skin. Its size was very large when it spread its wings out, with a \u00a0wingspan that was tens of meters.They landed and caused a large cyclone on the ground; sand and dust flew everywhere, causing everyone to shut their eyes.The group from the Xiao Clan followed Xiao Qiang to one of the Curtain Bats with excitement on their faces. This group of people had never seen Flying Spirit Beasts before. Now, they had the chance to ride one, and could not help but feel eager.Although Xiao Chen could use his Gravity Spell to fly slowly, he was still full of anticipation for this Curtain Bat. It would definitely be a whole new experience riding on it.After the Curtain Bat spread its wings out, its back and wings resembled a huge platform. Under the instructions of the coachmen, everyone removed their shoes and socks before climbing on barefooted.Standing barefooted on the Curtain Bat, Xiao Chen actually felt a faint suction holding his feet firmly. When he wanted to raise his feet, he was able to easily take a few steps forward; it was as stable as the ground.Xiao Chen felt astonished. No wonder the most used Flying Spirit Beast was this Curtain Bat. Although it was a little ugly, it was very stable.The Curtain Bat cried out and it created a hurricane. With a \u2018sou\u2019 sound, it flew into the air. This Curtain Bat did not rely on the flapping of its wings to fly, but instead it controlled the air currents; its speed was very fast.The crowd left behind in Mohe City slowly became smaller and smaller until they became mere specks, before completely disappearing. The sound of the wind was loud, but no one panicked due to the force of the suction beneath their feet. The smiles on their faces had yet to fade away.The Gloomy Forest was in a remote area, and it was quite a distance from Mohe City. Even riding on this Curtain bat would require four hours. Xiao Chen did not wish to waste any time, sohe sat down cross-legged and started to cultivate.A gratified look flashed in Xiao Qiang\u2019s face. He was diligent, not arrogant and hot-tempered, and he had the inheritance of the Thunder Emperor. He would definitely accomplish great things in the future.Under the influence of Xiao Chen, the others withdrew their excited expressions and sat down in a crossed-legged fashion to begin cultivating.\u201cBang!\u201dAfter flying for a long time, the Curtain Bat finally stopped. Xiao Chen opened his eyes, putting on his socks and shoes before gently jumping down.He saw a dull gray forest in front of him. He thought in his heart,\u00a0This should be Gloomy Forest, I wonder what kind of surprise will it bring me.Right at that moment, Xiao Chen felt a gaze filled with intense killing intent lingering on him. Looking in the direction where the killing intent was coming from, Xiao Chen saw the Zhang Clan\u2019s clan head.He was not trying to conceal it, and there was a strong hatred in his eyes. Waves of killing intent surged towards Xiao Chen, but Xiao Chen was not afraid. His lips curled up in a smile; he was not bothered by it.\u201cElder Xiao, are these the people your Xiao Clan is sending?\u201d the Mohe City Lord led four old men in gray robes over.Xiao Qiang nodded his head and pointed out the ten of them. When he reached Xiao Chen, under the City Lord\u2019s request, Xiao Qiang introduced him.\u201cElder Xiao, this is not your first time here. You are clear on the rules?\u201dXiao Qiang nodded his head, \u201cOf the ten people I have brought, the highest cultivation realm amongst them is Medial Grade Martial Master. The oldest cultivator is 18 years old. City Lord Dugu may inspect them.\u201dFor the Trial of Gloomy Forest, the participant cannot have a cultivation realm higher than Martial Master, or be older than 20 years old. If they overshot the requirements, they would be killed.Xiao Chen breathed out in relief; he did not expect this requirement. If there were no Martial Grand Masters, even if the Zhang Clan and Tang Clan worked together to deal with him, he was not afraid.After Dugu Feng and his group left, Xiao Qiang looked solemnly at the group he brought, \u201cI shall not elaborate on the dangers of Gloomy Forest; you all should be clear on that already. If there is any grudge amongst you, put it aside while you are in there.\u201d\u201cThis Trial is extremely difficult. Xiao Chen will be your captain; his words are my words.\u201dWhen the group heard that, there was a look of amazement in their eyes. However, it disappeared quickly. With Xiao Chen\u2019s strength, it was not strange for him to be made Captain.Xiao Qing waved his hand and did not let Xiao Chen speak, \u201cDon\u2019t reject this. I still have not told you your mission. Lead this group of people and keep them alive. Harvest 200 Rank 2 Demonic Beast\u2019s Demonic Core and your mission will be considered complete.\u201dXiao Chen felt helpless in his heart, but the First Elder had made his decision and he would not allow anyone to object to it. Xiao Chen could only accept this arduous and unrewarding undertaking.After half an hour, everyone\u2019s preparations were complete. Under the leadership of Xiao Chen, they slowly walked into the dull gray forest. They could see that the other two teams were also moving.\u201cHow cold!\u201dIn the instant they enter the forest, everyone could feel an attacking chill. The mud on the ground was actually pitch black, and it made their scalps feel numb.Raising his head to take a look, the tall and dense tree branches blocked off all sunlight; the forest was dusky.Everyone\u2019s vision was severely impaired. Xiao Chen looked towards the front; he could see a black fog filling the air, and was unable to see clearly.He sent out his Spiritual Sense and found that there was an unknown force hindering it. Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense was actually only able to cover an area of 200 meters.Xiao Chen felt surprised; he had not expected such a situation to occur. However, now was not the time to complain. Xiao Chen took out the map that the First Elder gave him and took a look, then he led the group towards the front.After twenty minutes, the scenery in front of the group's eyes had not changed. Finally, there were some people who could hold back no longer and complained, \u201cXiao Chen, where are you taking us? After walking for such a long time already, we still have not seen any Demonic Beasts. At this rate, we will never complete the mission of collecting 200 Demonic Cores.\u201dXiao Chen felt helpless in his heart; it had not yet been half an hour and already there were people who could not stand the loneliness. This burdensome work of being captain was truly difficult.\u201cYou are so eager to meet a Demonic Beast; are you not afraid of being eaten by it?\u201d someone at the side teased him.\u201cWhat a joke. I am here to kill Demonic Beasts, not to feed them!\u201d \u201cHow could that be possible?\u201d the person said in a loud voice.Xiao Chen could not be bothered by him. However, a dangerous aura was suddenly felt. He hurriedly called out, \u201cThere is danger! Everyone, be careful!\u201dWhen the rest heard this, they immediately became alert. The person who spoke earlier looked around, but did not discover anything. He said impatiently, \u201cDanger? Where is the danger you spoke of? Why do I not see it?\u201d\u201cPu Ci!\u201dFrom right above that person's head, the people at the side saw a horrifying scene. There was a long red tongue descending from above and it wrapped him up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a huge lizard circling around on the top of a tree, tens of meters above. Its red tongue wrapped around that Xiao Clan disciple and pulled him upwards.He struggled continuously, his feet flailing in the air. The crowd stared blankly at this as the man was pulled further away. They were unable to think of any ideas.Lightning Evasion!Rushing Thunder Chop!During this extremely urgent situation, Xiao Chen executed the Lightning Evasion in the direction of the sky. A streak of lightning broke through the eternal darkness of Gloomy Forest. Then, Xiao Chen instantly used the Rushing Thunder Chop.In the instant the lightning concealed, Xiao Chen appeared in the sky, looking like an ancient warrior. The Lunar Shadow Saber gave off a dazzling light, and the Rushing Thunder Chop struck at that red tongue.The lightning disappeared and the light vanished; darkness pervaded the forest once again. The crowd below quickly went to catch the Xiao Clan disciple as he fell from the sky.This Xiao Clan disciple was called Ye Lan; his surname was Ye. He was a servant that had shown steady and sure strength; he relied on that to enter to the core of the Xiao Clan disciples.He had a steady heart that exceeded that of an ordinary person. He cultivated for a long time in Seven Horn Mountain and had battled against many different dangerous Spirit Beasts; he had seen all sorts of terrifying Spirit Beasts.Despite his steady heart, he was frightened silly. The horrified expression on his face did not quickly fade away once he was caught.\u201cYe Lan, what did you see? Where is Xiao Chen?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, where is Cousin Xiao Chen? Why is he not back yet?\u201d Xiao Yulan asked anxiously. However, these people did not have any flying Martial Techniques; they had no way to see what happened.After a long time, Ye Lan finally recovered his wits. He said, \u201cHow scary! The Demonic Beast was formed by the Rank 2 Spirit Beast, Fire Lizard, demonizing. In Seven Horn Mountain, I have killed many of that kind of Spirit Beast.\u201d\u201cHowever, I have never seen such a huge Fire Lizard before. There was a surging black Qi all over its body. Its scarlet eyes are even more terrifying than the Fire Lizard King on Seven Horn Mountain.\u201dThe crowd was all startled by his description. They had not walked far yet, but they had already encountered such a terrifying Demonic Beast. Furthermore, it was just a Rank 2 Demonic Beast. When they thought about the journey ahead of them, they were all fearful.\u201cCousin Xiao Chen went to rescue you, why is he not back yet?\u201d Xiao Yulan asked anxiously again.A look of embarrassment flashed on Ye Lan\u2019s face; he did not expect that Xiao Chen was the one who rescued him. He said awkwardly, \u201cI only saw a flash of lightning, then I fell down.\u201dXiao Yulan said anxiously, \u201cI\u2019m going up to check out the situation.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go yet. Look at that piece of tongue that fell,\u201d Xiao Jian, who had maintained his silence, said suddenly.The piece of chopped off tongue was a meter long, and there was purple liquid oozing out from the wound. It was said that the blood of Demonic Beasts was purple. When the crowd saw it, they realized the rumor was true.The purple liquid flowed into the black ground and was instantly absorbed, disappearing without a trace. It was incredibly strange.However, this was not the most frightening thing. The red tongue seemed to have a life of its own, and it was flailing around on the ground as though it was trying to escape from something frightening.Everyone had a fearful expression. They had never seen such a strange thing before. In that moment, with their eyes opened wide and mouths left ajar, they were all extremely shocked.Finally, the tongue stopped flailing around and was pulled towards an old broad tree by a huge suction force. Suddenly, a face appeared on the bark. It opened its mouth and black teeth could be seen inside.\u201cChi Chi!\u201dThat huge mouth swallowed the tongue whole, continuously chewing as though it was tasting a unique delicacy, and making \u2018chi chi\u2019 sounds without end.\u201cIt\u2019s a Tree Spirit. The Tree Spirit is a Rank 3 Demonic Beast. We only walked for such a short distance... how is it possible that we met something like this already?\u201d someone shouted loudly when he recognized the terrifying Tree Spirit.\u201cLet\u2019s go quickly. This Tree Spirit is not something we can deal with right now. After it finishes eating the tongue, we will be next,\u201d Xiao Jian said calmly.\u201cRight, right, that\u2019s right! This is a Rank 3 Demonic Beast; it is equivalent to a Martial Grand Master.\u201dXiao Yulan looked incredibly anxious as she said, \u201cWe can\u2019t go. Cousin Xiao Chen is still up there. What is he going to do if we leave?\u201d\u201cFirst Senior Sister, Cousin Xiao Chen\u2019s strength speaks for itself. He will be fine. Instead, it is dangerous for us to remain here,\u201d many of them wanted to beat a hasty retreat.Just at this moment, the Tree Spirit finished with the red tongue. The gray eyes on the tree bark stared at the crowd, revealing a strange smile. It looked like it was making a funny face.\u201cCrap! It is done eating; we can no longer escape!\u201d Xiao Jian quickly drew his Spirit Weapon, completely entering into a battle-ready state.\u201cShua!\u201dCountless tree branches came grabbing at the crowd like ghostly hands. Immediately, many of them were caught by their arms or legs and were pulled towards the huge mouth.Xiao Jian calmly hacked at a few branches that came flying towards him. Then he dashed towards the people caught by the tree branches. Along the way, he hacked the tree branches relentlessly flying at him to bits.Xiao Yulan and a few other Xiao Clan disciples performed the same action as Xiao Jian did. They were all undergoing a bitter battle with the tree branches, and were up to their ears in work.\u201cDang!\u201dAfter saving another person, Xiao Jian caught one of the tree branches that was flying towards him. A fierce flame came surging from his hands, and with a \u2018shua\u2019 it traveled along the tree branch heading towards the tree trunk.The temperature of a cultivator\u2019s flames were many times higher than an ordinary flame. If it came in contact with dry tree branches, it would definitely turn into ashes immediately.However, Xiao Jian\u2019s flames were only able to travel along the surface of the Tree Spirit\u2019s branches. However, he easily sensed the Tree Spirit\u2019s pain; the damage done to it was significant.Xiao Jian felt some dissatisfaction; even after his flames were strengthened by the Rainbow Flame Python inner core, their strength was not at the level he anticipated.\u201cCousin Yulan, we have to think of a way to break out of this encirclement. Normally, this kind of Tree Spirit would not move around,\u201d Xiao Jian hacked apart a few more tree branches and frowned when he saw that their surroundings were filled with tree branches.Xiao Yulan looked into the sky with a helpless expression, her pretty face filled with worry. Finally she said, \u201cWe will work together to create a path. We will send out this group of people first, then I will come back.\u201dXiao Jian did not say anything else as they did their best. Strong Martial Techniques were executed without holding back. The tree branches blocking their front disintegrated into small pieces.Upon seeing this, the people behind them quickly followed. In that instant the tree branches went into a frenzy, leaves falling one after another. The group of people arduously advanced forward, managing to advance step by step. They would soon break through the boundary of where the tree branches could reach.Just as the crowd was about to relax, countless tree branches suddenly sprouted up from the ground. They were like dried up hands, grabbing the ankles of the crowd and raising them up into the air.This Tree Spirit was too sly; it only used the tree branches on its body to trick them . Just as they thought they were going to escape it made its move, causing everyone to fall in its trap.\u201cWhat should we do? Are we going to get eaten by this Tree Spirit just like that? Waaah!! I don\u2019t want to die!\u201d one of the girls in the group suddenly cried.When the rest of them heard her, they felt extremely terrified. They remembered the earlier scene of the Tree Spirit eating the red tongue and could not help but tremble.Xiao Jian and Xiao Yulan were both continuously hacking at the tree branches at their feet. However, every time they were about to break loose new branches would rise up and bind them again.Eventually, the Tree Spirit realized the strength of these two. Several more tree branches flew out, binding both their hands and feet. Instantly, they were hanging in the air, unable to move.\u201cZe! Ze! Ze!\u201dSeeing that it had bound everyone, the strange face on the tree let out an eerie laughter. Upon hearing it, the crowd was filled with fear and despair.\u201cMeteor Burst!\u201dA shout suddenly came from above their heads. A human figure descended from the sky, and the shadow of a dragon could faintly be seen on his body.\u201cBoom!\u201dThere was a heaven-shockingly loud sound, and the dirt on the ground was swirling around. Under the ground, a large tree branch was chopped in half and a pool of blood spurted out violently. Xiao Chen gently twisted his body and evaded the blood stream.The Tree Spirit dried out painfully, the tree trunk squirming around on the ground, which caused the ground to tremble. This made it difficult for the recently descended Xiao Clan disciples to stand on the ground.Xiao Chen took advantage of this opportunity to leap off the ground. Using his saber, he cut through several large branches. A few streams of purple blood came spurting out. The Tree Spirit was in even more pain, \u00a0and the trembling of the ground became even more violent.\u201cBang!\u201dXiao Chen focused his strength on both his legs before stomping down fiercely. After a loud \u2018bang\u2019, the trembling ground calmed. The might of his stomp had thoroughly suppressed the Tree Spirit, and the ground finally stopped trembling.\u201cPurple Thunder True Fire! Shoot, Shoot, Shoot!\u201dThe flame that was suspended above his finger spun rapidly, then three purple flames flew out leaving\u00a0a tail\u00a0streaming behind, and all shot into the trunk of the Tree Spirit.The Tree Spirit\u2019s cries of pain reverberated throughout the forest, causing fear to rise in those who heard it. Xiao Chen turned around and said to the crowd, \u201cLeave quickly, I will guard the rear. We have to arrive at the camp of the Xiao Clan, which is listed on the map, by tonight. This Gloomy Forest is quite strange.\u201dWhen the others heard that, they quickly retreated. Xiao Jian looked at the Purple Thunder True Fire Xiao Chen had shot out. His expression was extremely gloomy, but he followed the crowd and retreated.\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, take care of yourself,\u201d Xiao Yulan saw that Xiao Chen was fine, so she relaxed.The Tree Spirit finally stopped howling in grief. The eyes on its ghastly face stared at Xiao Chen maliciously. The tree branches broken by Xiao Chen were regrowing rapidly.\u201cTu!\u201dA withered tree branch shot out from the huge mouth of that horrific face. The ends of the tree branch separated into five slender fingers, resembling ghostly hands, each grabbing towards Xiao Chen.\u201cDang! Dang!\u201dXiao Chen brandished his saber and blocked them. The Lunar Shadow Saber gave off a metallic clanging sound when they clashed. The clank of metal lingered on, but the tree branch was not actually cut apart by the Lunar Shadow Saber.\u201cFlight On Wings, One Line Chop.\u201dA plain saber strike hacked heavily at the withered tree branch. The spectral hand was chopped apart by Xiao Chen. However, after a short moment, another hand extended out.Xiao Chen was astonished. He did not want to be delayed here, but this Tree Spirit was incomparably queer. It was hard to say whether or not it had a trump card. Retreating backward by a few steps, he used the Lightning Evasion to flee.A lightning bolt streaked across and Xiao Chen\u2019s figure appeared 500 meters away. He relaxed and was about to look around him to find Xiao Yulan and the rest.Suddenly, a stream of strong Qi came from behind. Xiao Chen trembled in fear as he quickly evaded towards the left.\u201cChi!\u201dA tree branch pierced through his arm. Xiao Chen cried out in pain and he broke out in cold sweat. If he had not evaded in time, this tree branch would have punctured his heart.It was unthinkable that the speed of the Tree Spirit\u2019s attack was capable of catching up to lightning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 65:\u00a0Essence of the TrialXiao Chen took a deep breath as he looked at the bloody hole in his left arm. It seemed that his left hand was temporarily disabled.Xiao Chen took out a Blood Replenishing Pill and crushed it between his fingers, turning it into a medicinal liquid. He spread the liquid on his wound and instantly felt a cooling feeling. The pain from his wound decreased significantly.He ripped a piece of fabric from his clothes and wrapped it around his wound, then Xiao Chen headed forward to look for the tree branch that had shot out.He walked about ten meters before he found the tree branch that pierced his arm. It stabbed through several huge trees before finally embedding itself in one of them.Xiao Chen struggled, eventually managing to pull it out. He examined it carefully and discovered that this withered tree branch was only as thick as his finger, and not longer than one meter. However, it was giving off a faint radiance.He got the feeling that it was unusual, so he enveloped the branch in his Spiritual Sense. Finally, he saw something different; the spirituality of this tree branch was higher than the weapons in Mo Fan\u2019s shop.Remembering that a spell in the Compendium of Cultivation required a natural object that contained spirituality, Xiao Chen joyfully stowed it in his Universe Ring.After discovering the direction Xiao Yulan and the rest had gone, Xiao Chen executed two Lightning Evasion in a row before seeing the figures of the group.Xiao Yulan ran out from the group before Xiao Chen was near, asking him in concern, \u201cCousin Xiao Chen, what\u2019s wrong with your hand?\u201dXiao Chen laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just a small injury. It will be fine after a day. Let\u2019s go. I\u2019ll lead you all to the Xiao Clan campsite.\u201dThis time, no one refuted Xiao Chen\u2019s words; \u00a0no one expressed any dissatisfaction along the way. Xiao Chen had won the respect of the entire group after the difficulty they had just endured.For the rest of the journey, Xiao Chen kept his Spiritual Sense released. When he detected any Demonic Beast, he would circle around it. There were no other battles along the way.After two hours, the group finally arrived at the Xiao Clan campsite. This site was where the Xiao Clan seniors had previously trained and built a simple camp.The campsite had three simple wooden huts. Although it was simple and crude, it had all the daily living necessities. It was an extremely suitable place for them to rest for the next few days.Xiao Chen felt no danger near the campsite with his Spiritual Sense, so he said, \u201cEveryone! Let\u2019s tidy up the campsite first. It has been a long time since anyone was here and it is covered in dust.\u201dThe group dispersed; these cultivators were the elite of the Xiao Clan\u2019s younger generation. Xiao Chen was very satisfied that they used caution as they cleaned up the camp.\u201cAh! There is a dead person here\u2026\u201d an alarmed cry interrupted Xiao Chen\u2019s thoughts.Xiao Chen quickly ran over; the dead person was an old man wearing the uniform of the Tang Clan. Xiao Chen frowned,\u00a0Why did a Tang Clan cultivator come all the way here?The state of the old man was extremely horrifying; his chest was torn open, his heart and lungs were missing. It seemed that he had been eaten by a Demonic Beast. No wonder his face wore such a terrified expression.Xiao Jian inspected the body and said, \u201cThis person is a Martial Grand Master. Furthermore, he died not too long ago.\u201dEveryone was alarmed,\u00a0Why did a Martial Grand Master of the Tang Clan come to the Xiao Clan campsite?\u00a0Furthermore, he died at the borders of Gloomy Forest. How unbelievable!\u201cQuick look! There is another corpse here!\u201d another alarmed voice cried out.This corpse was found in one of the wooden huts. Xiao Chen moved as fast as lightning, and hurried over. The state of this corpse was the same as the previous one.Seeing his attire, Xiao Chen was once again astonished. This was a person from the Zhang Clan. Furthermore, he was also a Martial Grand Master.Xiao Chen connected all the clues together in his head, and a scene appeared to him. Before the Trial of Gloomy Forest started, the two Martial Grand Masters had snuck into the Xiao Clan campsite.As Martial Grand Masters, they should have easily been able to kill everyone here. However, for reasons unknown, these two Martial Grand Masters were unable to best Demonic Beasts before achieving their goal.Xiao Chen shuddered when he thought of this,\u00a0For the sake of killing him, the Tang Clan and Zhang Clan actually dared to go against the rules set by the City Lord. What else would they not dare to do?However, I want to see how many Martial Grand Masters you will send to die,\u00a0Xiao Chen thought to himself ruthlessly.Everyone worked together to bury the two corpses. The main reason being, they were afraid that the bodies would attract strong Demonic Beasts.\u00a0Everyone\u2019s hearts were shadowed as they looked\u00a0upon the two Grand Martial Masters who had each died miserably.Under Xiao Chen\u2019s command, they started building traps to act as alarms in the area surrounding the campsite. Everyone here had the experience of training in Seven Horn Mountain, so these kinds of traps were familiar to them. Thus, there were no difficulties setting up the traps.\u201cYe Lan, come with me to inspect the surroundings. We will officially begin killing the Demonic Beasts tomorrow,\u201d Xiao Chen told the tired Ye Lan, who was leaning on a tree, after resting for a period of time.Ye Lan did not want to move and muttered, \u201cWhy is it always me?\u201dXiao Chen smiled, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Didn\u2019t you repeatedly say along the way that you want to kill Demonic Beasts? Now I am giving you a chance to shine; are you still not satisfied?\u201dWhen the rest heard this, they all smiled. They felt this fellow was asking for it. He could only blame himself for talking so big \u00a0on their way here.\u201cXiao Chen, let me accompany you. Your left hand is injured. I am afraid that if you meet any Demonic Beasts they will be difficult to handle,\u201d Xiao Yulan said from inside a wooden hut.Xiao Chen shook his head, \u201cNo need; this campsite is a little strange. Your strength is the highest amongst us, so you should stay here to look after this place. My hand is fine and will not get in the way.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, I\u2019m just going to check things out. There should not be any danger.\u201dXiao Yulan did not persist after she heard Xiao Chen say this. She only exhorted him again and again to be careful.Ye Lan followed behind Xiao Chen despite the dissatisfaction he felt in his heart. They both went south of the campsite.In this dark and dim forest, the shadows of the tree branches were swaying, and a cold wind blew gently. Unseen dangers are always hiding in the darkness. As Ye Lan followed behind Xiao Chen, he kept feeling a pair of eyes staring at him from the darkness, and he trembled with fear.Ye Lan looked at Xiao Chen\u2019s face, but he was unable to see any expression on it. This made it impossible for Ye Lan to determine what Xiao Chen was thinking. \u00a0Xiao Chen seemed especially calm in the darkness.\u201cPu Ci!\u201dA red shadow swept towards the two of them in the darkness. A tyrannical Qi spread through the forest, scaring Ye Lan silly.\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2026 Fire Lizard! This is its\u2026 tongue!\u201d Ye Lan already had a shadow cast in his heart by this kind of Demonic Beast. He started shaking uncontrollably as he spoke.As Le Yan watched with an astonished gaze, Xiao Chen grabbed the red tongue with his right hand. A electrical light flashed in the darkness and it travelled along the red tongue, reaching the body of the Fire Lizard.The long tongue gave off an electric light, \u00a0resembling a luminous ribbon made from a clap of thunder. It was utterly breathtaking.\u201cAh!\u201dA painful cry resounded and the Fire Lizard withdrew his tongue. The gloomy forest was extremely terrifying.\u201cWhat are you doing staring blankly?! Chase after it!\u201d Xiao Chen dashed forward, and he urged Ye lan before he left.\u201cEn!\u201d Ye Lan nodded his head resolutely and followed after Xiao Chen.Its body was about twenty meters long, and its skin was covered in red lumps. A black Qi spread around the Fire Lizard\u2019s body, and its ten meter long tail was continuously thrashing on the ground.A pair of red pupils glared at Xiao Chen and Ye Lan as they rushed over.The scene before Ye Lan triggered the shadow in his heart, and his legs trembled as he said, \u201cXiao Chen, can you deal with it alone? My legs seems to have gone soft\u2026\u201dXiao Chen smiled coldly, \u201cDo you think that you are going to have any future prospect like this? What\u2019s the point of coming to kill Demonic Beasts then? Where is the courage you had while competing against the core disciples of the Xiao Clan as an outer disciple?\u201d\u201cI have already sent some electricity into its body; it will not be able to move for a period of time. If you are a man, then go and stab it with your sword.\u201dDue to the earlier incident, a huge shadow was created in Ye Lan\u2019s heart with regards to Demonic Beasts. Thus, Xiao Chen specially brought him out to help him get overcome his fear.Otherwise, if he maintained such an attitude, he might die or even drag down his teammates when the proper trial started. At this moment, all he had to do was stab at the Fire Lizard with his sword in order to remove the shadow.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cBut what?! Are you lacking even that little bit of courage? If you cannot even do this then I\u2019ll send you out of Gloomy Forest tomorrow. You can continue to be an outer disciple and forget about rising any further for the rest of your life.\u201d\u201cCan it really not move?\u201d\u201cYe Lan, are you still a man? Even females are not as fainthearted as you. Hesitating at such a moment of life and death... Do you really want to die so much?\u201dXiao Chen\u2019s merciless words cut into Ye Lan\u2019s heart like a sharp knife, causing his anger to slowly rise.\u201cFuck! It\u2019s just a Fire Lizard! I have killed plenty of them in Seven Horn Mountain,\u201d Ye Lan shouted out explosively, spewing out a vulgarity. His body flew forward and stabbed the body of the Fire Lizard with his sword.The strength behind this sword was great, and in addition, his cultivation was at the Superior Martial Disciple realm. The sword ruthlessly thrust in and a stream of purple blood spurted out, spattering his face.The Fire Lizard cried out again in pain, then it managed to break \u00a0free from the restraint of the purple light in its body. A\u00a0baleful aura\u00a0erupted forth and a huge lizard tail came flying at him.Xiao Chen was surprised and was about to assist, but Ye Lan had an angry look on his face. A killing intent flashed in his eyes, as he turned around and ruthlessly hacked at the flailing lizard tail.\u201cDang!\u201dA huge force knocked Ye Lan into the air, but he did not panic. He somersaulted in the air and landed solidly on the ground. He grasped his sword, standing straight and tall, and gave the Fire Lizard a mocking look.The robes on Ye Lan\u2019s body fluttered around. At this moment, even the eternal darkness of Gloomy Forest was not able to conceal Ye Lan\u2019s boundless battle intent.Xiao Chen smiled faintly and revealed a satisfied expression. So long as Ye Lan could overcome the fear in his heart, his courage would remain strong and dealing with the Fire Lizard would be easy for him.However, whether or not he could kill it was hard to say. Xiao Chen was not too worried, though. With enough practise, and going through some life and death situations, everyone would improve.This was the meaning of the entire trial; to transverse the line between life and death, to experience the truth of the martial way.The will of men will transcend heaven, and I shall dictate my own fate; not the heavens. I look towards the great Dao, and advance step by step. Even if the road ahead is full of thorns, I will not fear. My sword shall accompany me, and my will as a cultivator will never falter.This kind of life is not ordinary, and without initiative or drive, it\u00a0would plod on monotonously.Just like those people who chased after their ideals in his past life, although their path was different, the Dao\u00a0remains the same. If one has a firm conviction, one will have a bright future .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 66:\u00a0Bonfire\u201cMartial Technique, Moon Breaker!\u201dThe Fire Lizard\u2019s tail swept towards Ye Lan once again but he leaped into the air and used the Yellow Ranked Martial Technique, Moon Breaker. With a \u2018shua\u2019 sound, the lizard\u2019s tail was immediately chopped in half.\u201cPu Ci!\u201dThe Fire Lizard roared painfully and its long red tongue moved like a phantom, heading towards Ye Lan. Ye Lan was unable to evade in time and was captured by the red tongue once again. However, this time, he did not panic.Just as he was about to be pulled into the mouth of the Fire Lizard, a sword sliced apart the Fire Lizard\u2019s tongue. After Ye Lan landed on the ground, he quickly retreated to a distant area.Purple Thunder True Fire! Shoot!Xiao Chen made his move at this moment, purple flames revolving on the tip of his finger. There was the sound of wind being broken, then the flames were shot into the Fire Lizard\u2019s mouth.\u201cBoom!\u201dA huge explosive sound rang from within its mouth and it was badly mangled, but the Fire Lizard was not dead. The black Qi around its body wiggled around as the injury on its head rapidly healed.However, the purple fire Xiao Chen left in its body did not give it a chance to heal completely. With just a thought, the Essence in\u00a0his\u00a0body was consumed greatly.A huge purple flame flared up from the body of the Fire Lizard. The flame and the black Qi fought against each other as the Fire Lizard writhed painfully on the ground.Suddenly, the black Qi surged up, causing Xiao Chen\u2019s purple flames to be forced out of its body. The wounds on its body started to heal once again.However, Xiao Chen was not surprised. He had killed a Fire Lizard earlier, and already had a certain understanding of it. That black Qi was the Demonic Qi that came from the Demonic World; it was incredibly strange and absolutely sinister.Currently, although the Fire Lizard had already forced out all the purple flames, the muscles and skin that regrew were no longer as resilient as they were before; it could easily be pierced.\u201cFlight On Wings, One Line Chop.\u201dAn incomparably\u00a0ordinary\u00a0saber ruthlessly hacked at the back of the Fire Lizard. Under tremendous force, the the Fire Lizard was chopped in half down the middle. A large amount of black Qi and purple blood leaked out.However, despite being chopped in half, the body began to knit itself back together while making a \u2018zi zi\u2019 sound; the lifeforce of this Demonic Beast was too strong.Neither man hesitated as they continued to attack it relentlessly. This Demonic Beast\u2019s internal organs had been injured by Xiao Chen\u2019s electricity at the start, then, its tail and tongue were chopped off by Ye Lan. Furthermore, it had been burned repeatedly by Xiao Chen\u2019s Purple Thunder True Fire.At this moment, it was only a spent force. Under the relentless attacks of the two of them, this Demonic Beast was finally dead after ten minutes. It was as dead as a door nail.[TL note: The idiom used for spent force is \u5f3a\u5f29\u4e4b\u672b \u00a0an arrow at the end of its flight, thought that some of the readers would be interested]The ground was covered in Fire Lizard flesh. Each piece of meat released a black Demonic Qi, and it looked incredibly strange. Xiao Chen could not be bothered with all this. After he dug out the Demonic Core from this Demonic Beast\u2019s brain, he used some fire to burn away the rest, leaving nothing, not even dregs.\u201cXiao Chen, thank you,\u201d Ye Lan looked at Xiao Chen and said sincerely. He was not stupid; he had finally guessed the purpose of Xiao Chen bringing him out.Xiao Chen smiled indifferently, \u201cThat\u2019s nothing. Since we are together, then we are partners. Furthermore, I had promised the First Elder that I would bring everyone back alive.\u201d\u201cI shall\u00a0credit acquiring this Demonic Core to\u00a0you. Let\u2019s go. We need to continue checking in this direction for another 500 meters.\u201dYe Lan was joyful in his heart; for disciples like him who had a different family name, if he could achieve a certain level of accomplishments for the Xiao Clan, then he would be bestowed the Xiao surname. When that happened, he would truly be amongst the core disciples of the Xiao Clan.Without a doubt, this trial was an important opportunity for him. Xiao Chen was like a\u00a0proctor\u00a0for them, grading their performance in this TrialThe two of them continued walking for another 500 meters and discovered that, aside from the Fire Lizard, there was a leopard type Demonic Beast and a Scarlet-Tailed Snake that had been\u00a0demonized\u00a0in the direction in front of them. Of the two Demonic Beast, they each killed one. Then they took note of their weak points, as well as some other important information.The two of them continued to check out the other three directions. They would either investigate the different types of Demonic Beasts, or kill them. They found that the north and east sides of the campsite were dangerous, and had designated them as danger zones, which they would not enter.This was because, aside from hidden Rank 3 Demonic Beasts, there were even some Rank 4 Demonic Beasts. These were not something that they had the abilities to deal with currently. If they went, they would be throwing their lives away.It was already approaching evening when they finished doing all this and returned to camp. At this moment, the temperature of Gloomy Forest turned even more chilly.\u201cYou guys have returned!\u201d a Xiao Clan cultivator standing guard said excitedly when he saw that the two of them returned safely.A bonfire was lit in the middle of the campsite, and the remaining people were all gathered there warming themselves. Although as cultivators they could use their Essence to resist the cold, the long term usage of their Essence would make them feel\u00a0incredibly regretful.Xiao Chen heard some sounds of argument coming from beside the bonfire before he managed to get near. He could not help but increase the pace of his footsteps.\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, you finally came back! Are you alright?\u201d Xiao Yulan got up and asked out of concern.\u201cWhat is the situation outside the camp? Do tell us about it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Are there a lot of Demonic Beasts?\u201d There was a lively discussion with everybody talking at once.Xiao Chen smiled indifferently, \u201cDon\u2019t be in such a rush. Later, Ye Lan will explain it all to you all in detail. I heard you guys arguing; what was that about?\u201dA female cultivator said, \u201cThey said that everyone should stay in the same wooden hut tonight. We do not agree to that.\u201dXiao Chen looked in the direction her finger pointed at and clearly understood which group she was talking about. In this Trial, there were a total of ten people. Including him, there were six males and four females. The ones who agreed are naturally the males. The ones who objected were the females.Xiao Yulan explained, \u201cOf the three wooden huts, one of them is a storehouse. Of the remaining two, one is used as a bedroom and the other is a place for cooking.\u201d\u201cSecond Young Master, as you can see, there is only one wooden hut. If we do not sleep together, how are we going to sleep? Furthermore, the beds are separate, what is there to be afraid of? The most important thing is that we are all pure,\u201d a male cultivator smiled as he said.\u201cIndeed, we are all very pure. The minds of this group of girls are too filthy. Who do they think we are?\u201d\u201cI am already 18 years old, but I\u2019m still a virgin. I have not even masturbated.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, you are all virgins. That\u2019s why it is even more dangerous. You have been craving it for many years. Who knows if you would be able to hold yourself back,\u201d one of the more fearless women said.Xiao Chen recognized her; she was called Xiao Ling`er, the treasured daughter of the Second Elder. She was one of the top beauties in the Xiao Clan, but she was normally very bizarre and caused all sorts of trouble.\u201cI have already resisted it for 18 years, what is a few more days? Xiao Ling`er, you look down on us too much. You are tarnishing our purity.\u201d\u201cStop!\u201d Xiao Chen saw that the conversation was starting to get out of hand and quickly shouted out for it to stop. Turning to face Xiao Jian, he asked, \u201cXiao Jian, what do you think?\u201dEver since Xiao Jian had been defeated by Zhang He, he seemed to have become another person. He was not as high-profiled as he was before, and said very little now.Seeing Xiao Chen ask him, Xiao Jian was stunned for awhile before he answered, \u201cI think it is best that we stay together.\u201d\u201cFirst Young Master is indeed wise,\u201d someone immediately followed up.Xiao Jian smiled indifferently, \u201cThere is only one wooden hut that has beds and space. If we want to sleep separately, then we will have to clear out the storehouse. If we did it that way, then when we find some Demonic Cores and Demonic Beast corpses, there would be no place to store them.\u201d\u201cYou all seemed to have also forgotten the most important thing. Remember we found the corpses of two Martial Grand Masters when we got here? This place is dangerous... extremely dangerous. It is best that we stay together to take care of each other,\u201d Xiao Jian had a stern expression as he said this.Xiao Jian\u2019s words seemed to make plenty of sense; this place was indeed strange. Xiao Chen turned his gaze to face Xiao Yulan and said, \u201cCousin Yulan, what do you think?The fiery red bonfire shined on Xiao Yulan\u2019s fair face, making it looks incredibly sexy. After Xiao Chen took a look, he felt as though his eyes were about to sink in and quickly collected himself.Feeling Xiao Chen\u2019s gaze, Xiao Yulan smiled tactfully making her look even more beautiful. The few Xiao Clan disciples who saw it were all stunned.\u201cI agree to Xiao Jian\u2019s view as well, but there needs to be a curtain separating the room in the middle. After all, it is not convenient for females to share a room with males.\u201dAfter they arrived at this compromise, Xiao Chen called Ye Lan to explain the situation of the surroundings, as well as to thoroughly explain the distribution of Demonic Beasts and their weaknesses.When Ye Lan finished, Xiao Chen said, \u201cI decided that we will split into two groups tomorrow. One group will head south and one group will head west. I will take charge of the group heading south; Xiao Jian will be responsible for the group heading west, and Ye Lan will be going with that group.No one had any objections with such an arrangement. After discussing further, Xiao Chen made arrangements for the night watch, and everyone dispersed.After everyone left, only Xiao Chen and Xiao Yulan remained by the bonfire. At this moment, Gloomy Forest was incredibly chilly, and occasionally there were strange roars coming from the distance.After the crowd had scattered, the lively scene disappeared. The cold wind blew gently as the terrifying Demonic Beast roars sounded one after another. All of these would cause a regular person to be afraid.Xiao Chen looked at the sky with the lush tree leaves completely covering the it; only by looking through some small cracks could one see the faint starlight in the sky.Such a scene caused Xiao Chen to recall his university camping activities in his past life. It seemed very similar. There were both male and female energetic youths.However, the existence of Demonic Beasts was impossible there, and it was not a situation where their lives would be in danger if they did not pay attention... One where they might get eaten by Demonic Beasts.Everyone knew that this trial was dangerous. However, since the ancient times, cultivators rushed in without hesitation to pursue the end of this road.However, were there truly Martial Gods in this world?\u00a0Xiao Chen\u2019s gaze pierced through the endless night, and he looked at the sky with vacant thoughts.\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, what are you thinking about?\u201d Xiao Yulan asked softly at his side. The flashing light of the fire made Xiao Yulan\u2019s face look extremely sexy.Xiao Chen smiled indifferently, \u201cEveryone is diligent and never slacking. Taking part in this trial of life and death, and seeking the martial way. However, the end of this path, is becoming a Martial God? Do Martial Gods truly exist?\u201dXiao Yulan heard this, shook her head and sighed, \u201cIndeed. Everyone knows that the end of the martial way is Martial God. However, in the hundreds of thousands of kilometers of territory in our Great Qin Nation, with tens of millions of capable warriors, there are only ten known Martial Monarchs. Even the most recent Martial Sage only existed 500 hundred years ago.\u201d\u201cIn my opinion, aside from the three orthodox Holy Lands, the one with the most possible chance of having a Martial God would be the Great Jin Nation,\u201d after her previous statement, she added this sentence.In the Tianwu Continent, aside from countless small nations and chaotic lands, the Qin Nation, Chu Nation, Tang Nation, Xia Nation, and Jin Nation were the strongest five nations. Of those, the Great Jin Nation has the largest Spirit Vein under the heavens. In fact, its strength was not inferior even when two of the other great nations combined their forces together.Xiao Yulan was not wrong when she said this; that place is a land filled with Spiritual Energy. They also have the most experts in the Continent.At this moment, a mournful and miserable shriek came from the east side of the camp. The sound was extremely agonized, as though it\u00a0was suffering the most terrifying punishment.Xiao Chen got up and stopped Xiao Yulan from getting up, \u201cDon\u2019t go. I\u2019ll go that a look first to see what danger is there. You immediately send out the signal the First Elder left behind.\u201dXiao Yulan seemed to want to say something, but Xiao Chen said with a stern expression, \u201cYou know about the matter in the Seven Horn Mountain. Regardless of the danger or the situation, I guarantee that there will not be any problems.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 67:\u00a0Controlling Demonic Beasts?Xiao Chen took long strides in the direction of the cry, toward the east side of camp. . As he came closer, the mournful cries grew louder. When he was about 400 meters away from the source of the sound, Xiao Chen stopped.He condensed his Spiritual Sense into a column and extended it out in front slowly. When it reached 200 meters, Xiao Chen could feel his Spiritual Sense being blocked by something.\u201cPu Ci!\u201dXiao Chen concentrated and fashioned his Spiritual Sense into the shape of a sword, slowly piercing through the barrier preventing it to go further. After a period of time, his Spiritual Sense finally arrived at the origin of the sound.In the groove ahead, there was a Martial Grand Master wearing the Tang Clan attire lying on the ground. In front of him was a huge black bird, gorging itself on his internal organs.Xiao Chen frowned slightly and looked up; there was a dark human figure floating in the air. He was darker than night, and his being gave off a feeling that\u00a0was as deep and wicked as a black hole.Although it was incredibly strange, Xiao Chen could sense a feeling of extreme weakness coming from the person\u2019s body; he should be severely injured.\u201cAfter hiding for three days, I finally found him,\u201d Xiao Chen heard the dark figure laughing and muttering to himself. The laughter in the black of night sounded like it came from hell, and was exceptionally gloomy.Suddenly, a black Qi came from the body of the cultivator on the ground and entered into the other\u2019s body. An expression of extreme pleasure appeared on his face. It was as though he could taste a delicacy as that strange bird fed on the internal organs.Even Xiao Chen could feel it when the wounds on the dark figure\u2019s body began significantly recovering as the black Qi entered them. He actually relied on the consumption of human internal organs to recover his wounds; it was truly unbelievable.When that black Qi dispersed, the Tang Clan cultivator on the ground no longer made any sounds. The huge black bird flew to the feet of dark figure with a \u2018shua\u2019 sound.Xiao Chen was very startled; he was sure that this huge bird was a Demonic Beast. This person could actually ride on a Demonic Beast. This was something he had never heard of before.\u201cI originally thought that certain death awaited me; who knew that I would run into this nourishment. How unexpected for this king,\u201d the man smiled, feeling pleased with himself as he stood on that huge bird.Suddenly, his complexion changed. He stared at Xiao Chen\u2019s column of Spiritual Sense. His eyes gave off a deep glow, and it was as though he could see through Xiao Chen\u2019s formless Spiritual Sense.Xiao Chen quickly caused his Spiritual Sense to turn into a small sword and hide behind a huge tree, sneakily observing the person.After the man saw Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense it seemed as though he remembered something horrifying; a terrified expression crossed his face. Riding on the demonic bird, he fled as though he was in a sorry state.It was extremely fast, like a bolt of black lightning, leaving behind countless dark streaks in the forest. He managed to instantly leave the range that Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense could observe.Xiao Chen did not dare to advance rashly; he slowly approached the dead Tang Clan cultivator only after the man was long gone. His state was exactly the same as the other two corpses they had found. From the looks of it, they had died while the bird fed on them.This person was able to easily kill three Martial Grand Masters despite his severely injured state. What terrifying realm was he at? Xiao Chen felt afraid just thinking about it.Regardless of the situation, this strange man had helped Xiao Chen indirectly remove some trouble. If the three Martial Grand Masters had appeared to kill Xiao Chen and his compatriots, they would not have survived.Recollecting his thoughts, Xiao Chen ignored the body on the ground and quickly returned to the camp. Xiao Chen temporarily hid this matter from Xiao Yulan when she interrogated him.He felt the matter was extremely strange. To think that there was actually someone who could control Demonic Beasts. Before he clarified this, Xiao Chen decided to temporarily not tell the others.Around midnight the two of them called someone over to take over their shift. After resting for four hours, the sky had already brightened. Of course, within the Gloomy Forest, it was still dark and gloomy. The visibility was no better than when it was night. However, at least it was not as cold as it was at night.Xiao Chen moved around his left arm, with the Blood Replenishing Pill he felt that there was no longer any major problems with it. Essence was not able to flow smoothly, but it was best not to make any excessive movements for the time being.The other people in the wooden hut were still sleeping. As there was no sunlight to shine into the wooden hut to wake them up, they were all fast asleep. Thus, Xiao Chen woke everyone up himself.After they finished washing up, they started to assign people to groups.When they were split into groups, Xiao Ling`er indicated that she wanted to be in Xiao Chen\u2019s group. There were even a few others who expressed the same thoughts.This caused Xiao Chen to feel a headache. Finally, he decided to merge Xiao Yulan\u2019s and Xiao Jian\u2019s group together. This way, the strength of the two groups would be similar.In the end, Xiao Ling`er was still assigned to Xiao Chen\u2019s group. Xiao Chen led four people and headed toward the south. He decided to start off with Fire Lizards.This was because he had already killed quite a few, and had some experience with them. He released his Spiritual Sense and soon managed to find a Fire Lizard on the top of a large tree.\u201cWait here first,\u201d Xiao Chen called out, and had the group stop.\u201cBrother Xiao Chen, why are we stopping? Is there a Demonic Beast? Where is it?\u201d Xiao Ling`er asked in a bizarre manner, her eyes looking all around, searching her surroundings.Xiao Chen smiled, \u201cStop looking for it, it\u2019s right above you.\u201dXiao Ling`er was startled when she heard this and retreated backwards a few steps. Xiao Chen raised his head and saw that the tree branches were crisscrossing in a complex manner, causing the sky to be hidden and looking very mysterious.This was Gloomy Forest. Aside from dangers coming from around you, one must also pay attention to what\u2019s above. Xiao Chen\u2019s smile faded away as he opened his mouth to say, \u201cAll of you, take a step back.\u201dAfter he said that, his body vanished from its original spot; a bright electrical light shone in the darkness. They could vaguely see Xiao Chen holding the Lunar Shadow Saber, jumping from tree branch to tree branch.When the electrical light faded away, the forest returned to its previously dark state. The four people below could not see even a hazy figure; all they could see were swaying tree branches.\u201cBoom!\u201dA loud sound came from the top and a huge monster fell to the ground, causing the ground to tremble. The four people on the ground hastily retreated.Xiao Chen did not immediately come down. Instead, he stood on a tree branch and smiled at the group, \u201cIt\u2019s your turn to perform. Do not be careless or you might end up dying.\u201dThe Fire Lizard had already stabilized itself before the four people managed to reply. When it saw them its hostility shifted and it swept its tail towards them.The four of them hurriedly jumped and scattered. A red shadow headed towards Xiao Ling`er; it looked like a red ribbon in the air, and its speed was ridiculously fast.What led Xiao Chen to feel surprised was that, despite Xiao Ling`er normally seeming weird, her reflexes were very fast. She pushed off the ground lightly with her feet and her body nimbly evaded the attack.She even slashed at the red tongue, creating a wound at the instant she turned around. This Fire Lizard was obviously stronger than the ones that Xiao Chen had met before; the toughness of its tongue was very strong. Xiao Ling`er\u2019s Spirit Weapon had no way to break it apart.The four of them were being chased around by the Fire Lizard, cursing Xiao Chen in their hearts, feeling that he was very despicable. Many of them regretted choosing to follow Xiao Chen.No one had expected that Xiao Chen would ignore them after attracting the Fire Lizard over. Those who were initially planning to rely on Xiao Chen regretted their decision.Time slowly went by and something that caused the four of them to want to vomit blood happened. Xiao Chen took out a bottle of wine fromt the Universe Ring and started drinking on the tree branch.\u201cXiao Chen, you are too despicable. After seeing that we are being chased in such a miserable manner, you are still not making any moves to help us!\u201d finally someone below could no longer tolerate it and scolded him.\u201cIndeed! Brother Xiao Chen, you are too heartless. Ling`er originally liked you a little, but now, I hate the sight of you,\u201d Xiao Ling`er said fiercely, but with a pout.Xiao Chen did not reply and revealed a faint, indifferent smile. After they overcame the initial shock, they finally got into the pace of things.They left wounds of varying degrees on the body of the Fire Lizard. After the four of them were hit by the Fire Lizard\u2019s tail a few times, there were two who had a trickle of blood at the corners of their mouths.However, Xiao Chen still did not make a move. This was their trial. If he made a move, then there would be no purpose to this. The martial path relied on the comprehensions one attained while they were in the middle of life and death situations; it could not be attained by the assistance of others.\u201cBang!\u201dXiao Ling`er was unable to evade once again and was hit by the Fire Lizard\u2019s tail. She spat out a mouthful of blood. Seeing this, Xiao Chen felt that he could bear it no more.However, something happened that surprised Xiao Chen. This girl did not cry out. Her pretty face was filled with an unswerving determination; she did not look like her usual, weird self.\u201cMartial Technique, Cloud Breaking Refreshing Breeze Chop.\u201dXiao Ling`er actually used a Martial Technique in the air; it was truly unbelievable. The sword in her hands was like a Cloud Breaking Refreshing Breeze, and with a white flash, the Lizard Tail was chopped into two halves.Xiao Ling`er landed firmly on the ground and wiped the blood off the corner of her lips. Then she made a face at Xiao Chen that caused him to fluctuate between laughter and tears.\u201cShua!\u201dAnother person exploded out and was able to break apart the Fire Lizard\u2019s greatest weapon; its red tongue. Now, the Fire Lizard had lost two of its greatest moves. Everyone\u2019s morale surged.Kill! Kill! Kill!Everyone was excited and started to execute their Martial Techniques, exhausting their Essence. They actually managed to make this terrifying Demonic Beast attempt to beat a hasty retreat, and in a short while it no longer had its initial imposing look.\u201cSince I was chased by you so miserably earlier, I definitely have to kill you today!\u201d one of the Xiao Clan cultivators, who had his behind smacked by the Lizard Tail twice before, said ruthlessly.Just when the Fire Lizard was about to die, an ice arrow gave off a cold gleam and flew from a distant place. With a \u2018shua\u2019 sound, it killed the Fire Lizard. A cold Qi spread throughout the Fire Lizard\u2019s body.It caused all the black Qi in its body to be expelled. After that, the Fire Lizard instantly turned into an ice sculpture. The cold Qi was very threatening. Everyone was startled and did not understand what was going on.\u201cBang!\u201dXiao Chen leaped down from the tree and fired out a stream of purple flame, colliding with a second ice arrow coming from a distance, resulting in an intense explosion.The ice disappeared into nothing, but the Purple Thunder True Fire did not weaken at all and continued to fly forward.\u201cBoom!\u201dAfter a while, there was another explosion coming from the front. There were the sounds of footsteps from a group of people coming towards them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That is Tang Feng,\u201d when the group of people came closer Xiao Chen and the rest were able to quickly identify them.The Tang Clan\u2019s group also consisted of five people. Tang Feng was holding a longbow made of ice crystals. When they were about 100 meters away, they stopped moving. When he saw Xiao Chen, a shocked expression appeared on his face for awhile.After a long time, he smiled, \u201cSo Brother Xiao is here. What a coincidence. My apologies but this Fire Lizard\u2019s Demonic Core is ours.\u201dHearing what he said, the few Xiao Clan disciples behind Xiao Chen felt angry. After fighting for half a day, this fellow comes over and snatches it. How improper!Xiao Ling`er frowned slightly and said mockingly, \u201cIf you have guts, then put aside your bow and come over here.\u201dThe remaining people also roared out. It was obvious to them that the ice crystal bow in Tang Feng\u2019s hands was not ordinary. Seeing him stand so far, it was clear that he was extremely cautious.Tang Feng played with the ice crystal bow in his hand, revealing an indifferent smile, \u201cBrother Xiao, your Xiao Clan members were being pressured to the point where they could not retaliate. My arrow could be said to be their saviour. Handing a tiny Demonic Core to me would not be too unreasonable.\u201d\u201cIt is very unreasonable,\u201d Xiao Chen could not be bothered to play word games with him and continued saying indifferently, \u201cIf they had not severely injured this Fire Lizard in the first place, do you think that you could kill it with just one arrow?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already ignoring the issue of your actions disrupting our trial. Yet, now you want to engage in some glib talk in front of me? Scram immediately.\u201dTang Feng\u2019s complexion changed. He originally thought that Xiao Chen\u2019s group was already eliminated by the elders of the Zhang Clan and Tang Clan. His intention in coming here was only to meet up with these elders.He had never expected that Xiao Chen would actually be standing right in front of him, still alive and well. Thinking very hard, Tang Feng said coldly, \u201cXiao Chen, you look down on my strength too much. Do you dare to receive three of my arrows? If you are able to, then I will leave immediately.\u201cWe will receive it! Why not? Even ten arrows would not be a problem. Do you think Elder Brother Xiao Chen is afraid of you?\u201d Xiao Ling`er\u2019s melodious voice answered Tang Feng before Xiao Chen could say anything.\u201cElder Brother Xiao Chen, you must do your best! Don\u2019t let this fellow get too arrogant,\u201d Xiao Ling`er said to Xiao Chen in her usual, bizarre fashion.Xiao Chen rolled his eyes at her. This girl was obviously just trying to get revenge. She was put into a miserable state by the Fire Lizard earlier, and now that there was a chance for her to obtain revenge, she grabbed onto it immediately.In order to deal with someone who used long range attacks like Tang Feng, one must rapidly get close and finish it quickly, not giving him any chance to put distance between them. Just like now, standing where they were waiting to shoot him down was undoubtedly the most stupid method.\u201cXiao Chen, I will not fire more than what I said; just three arrows. If you can withstand three arrows of mine, I will immediately leave. Do you dare to agree?\u201d seeing Xiao Chen not say anything, Tang Feng used the most vulgar method to agitate him into doing what he wanted.Ever since Tang Feng appeared, Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense had not left the ice crystal bow in Tang Feng\u2019s hands. Cold Qi was flowing in that bow, and the ice attributed Spiritual Energy was relentlessly gathering in it.This was obviously a Spirit Weapon with an ice attribute embedded inside. Furthermore, Tang Feng\u2019s Martial Spirit was likely to be an ice attribute, allowing this ice bow to relentlessly absorb the cold energy from its surroundings.However, Xiao Chen was not afraid. This was because Tang Feng was only a peak Superior Martial Disciple. Although he was already a step into the Martial Master realm, he was, in the end, still a Martial Disciple.There would be a limit to his strength. He would not have any way to fully display the huge strength contained in this ice bow.Xiao Chen smiled indifferently, \u201cWhy would I not dare to receive three arrows from you? If I can withstand them, do you dare to receive a saber blow from me?\u201d\u201cWhy would I not dare? I am just not sure if you will still be alive after receiving my three arrows,\u201d Tang Feng smiled coldly. It was clear from his words that he was extremely confident in the ice crystal bow in his hands.Tang Feng\u2019s hand grasped the ice crystal bow and his aura suddenly changed. Drawing the bowstring, turning the bow into a shape similar to that of the full moon, the cold Qi poured into the bow. A cold light radiated out, with bits of ice swimming around it like tadpoles, as though alive.\u201cXiu!\u201dThe bowstring vibrated and the first ice arrow fired out like an icy rainbow. A boundless cold Qi fired towards Xiao Chen\u2019s throat, giving off a \u2018wuwu\u2019 sound. It was as though an ice deity leaped across with a matchless momentum.\u201cDang!\u201dXiao Chen\u2019s gaze was as calm as still water, the Lunar Shadow Saber in his hands suddenly radiating with an electrical light. A melodious shattering sound resounded, and the ice arrow was shattered into countless fragments.\u201cHua!\u201dThe ice fragments in the air did not drop to the ground. Instead, they melted into a pool of water and formed into an ice arrow again. Its speed increased explosively by a fold when it was about a meter in front of Xiao Chen.Xiao Chen took a few steps urgently backward, sending out the energy of the Demonic Core in the Lunar Shadow Saber. The electrical light flickered continuously, creating a countless number of thunderbolts, then he chopped down with the saber again.\u201cDang Dang!\u201dThis time, the ice arrow turned into water and fell to the ground; it no longer looked awe inspiring.When Xiao Ling`er, who was standing at his side, saw the scene in front of her, she immediately regretted her actions. The strength of Tang Feng\u2019s ice bow was incredibly strong.Tang Feng smiled coldly, \u201cI thought you were very strong; turns out, not so much. This is just the first arrow. There are still two more arrows after this. I want to see how you withstand them.\u201dOnce he said that, Tang Feng immediately drew the bowstring again. Cold Qi rushed into the bow again and an ice arrow was formed again. A chill as cold as the North Pole penetrated through the air as the arrow was released.This arrow was so fast that it did not even leave behind a shadow in the air. It was impossible to see with the human eye. It was as though it had broken through space and just appeared in front of Xiao Chen.Xiao Chen extended out his right hand and pointed forward. The surging Essence in his body poured out towards his right hand like a river; a small spark was ignited, looking like a weak firefly in the night.\u201cBang!\u201dWhen the ice arrow met with the finger, there was a loud explosion. Xiao Chen frowned but did not move a single jot, colliding with the ice arrow.Tang Feng\u2019s right hand suddenly fiddled with the bowstring and an invisible ripple caused a boundless cold Qi to pour into the ice arrow. This instantly increased the pressure placed on Xiao Chen, causing his foot to move a little.\u201cPurple Thunder True Fire, explode!\u201dXiao Chen shouted out gently and a fierce, purple fire extended from the soles of his foot to the fingertips of his right hand, making his hand look like that of a fire deity.That firefly-like glow instantly erupted into a huge, boundless flame, causing the ice arrow to completely evaporate, and turn into steam rising from Xiao Chen\u2019s finger.Under the heat of this flame, it caused people to feel a warmth despite the cold temperature of Gloomy Forest. This showed how hot it was.Xiao Ling`er said excitedly, \u201cElder Brother Xiao Chen, that\u2019s amazing!\u201dSeeing the ice arrow evaporate into steam, Tang Feng\u2019s complexion changed as he smiled coldly, \u201cDon\u2019t be too pleased yet. I still have one more arrow.\u201dTang Feng drew the bowstring again. This time, his right hand was emitted a light, and the entire ice bow also gave off a resplendent glow. A boundless ice attributed Spiritual Energy from the surroundings rapidly gathered at his right hand.A cold gleam filled the sky behind him like a nova of frost, or a vast sky full of stars; it was gorgeous. The surrounding temperature also lowered significantly.Xiao Chen extended out his Spiritual Sense and he saw a huge bird behind Tang Feng. The body of this bird was extremely strange; one half was ice and the other half was fire.Feeling startled, Xiao Chen suddenly remembered the matter of Tang Feng bidding for the Rainbow Flame Python inner core in Linlang Pavilion. It was obvious that he wanted to use it to increase his fire attributed attacks.However, the two arrows that he shot out, and even the third arrow, were all obviously ice attributed,\u00a0What was going on?The most important thing was that he could obviously feel that Tang Feng\u2019s strength was raised to the Martial Master realm,\u00a0What was going on? Could he have been suppressing his own cultivation all along?\u201cGo! Ice Fury!\u201dVia Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense, the half of that huge fire and ice bird that consisted of ice instantly became significantly dimmer.The cold gleam behind him disappeared, and it turned into an arrow on the bow. That arrow grew larger as the wind blew on it, and soon it became an ice arrow that was tens of meters long.While the ice arrow existed, a cold wind attacked. Streams of fog covered its surface, billowing around. The terrifying ice arrow was actually still growing larger.The few people behind Xiao Chen cried out in surprise. Xiao Ling`er was so frightened she closed her eyes and did not dare to watch what happened next.This ice arrow may be incomparably huge, but its movement was not at all slow In fact, it was not remotely inferior to the first two arrows. However, due to its huge size, the crowd was able to see it with their eyes.As the ice arrow came piercing across the land, a boundless cold Qi covered the surroundings. Xiao Chen could feel his legs seems becoming stiff. This way, his speed would vastly decrease, and it would be difficult for him to evade the arrow.Borrowing the might of a Spirit Weapon, do you think I don\u2019t know how to do that too?\u00a0Xiao Chen smiled coldly as he thought this in his heart.Putting some strength into his arm as he flung the Lunar Shadow Saber forward, the energy of the Rank 6 lightning attributed Demonic Core was fully unleashed. A boundless electrical light shone in the darkness. It was so bright it was blinding.The surrounding lightning attributed Spiritual Energy relentlessly rushed towards the Lunar Shadow. The electrifying light formed countless glowing arcs. It looked like a lightning bolt in the dark night sky.\u201cHua!\u201dThe saber clashed with the ice arrow in midair, and with a \u2018shua\u2019 sound the Lunar Shadow Saber sliced into the ice arrow. Countless pieces of ice fell, then were zapped into oblivion by the electrical light.At this moment, it was no longer a battle between two people, but a battle between two Spirit Weapons. Based on the scene in the air, it was obvious that Xiao Chen\u2019s Lunar Shadow was gaining the upper hand.\u201cDang!\u201dThe Lunar Shadow pierced through, and the huge ice arrow gave off a resounding clang, shattering into countless pieces. However, the fierce light on the saber was still just as blinding. Before the shattered pieces of ice touched the ground, they were all zapped into oblivion.\u201cKill!\u201dXiao Chen shouted lightly and pushed off the ground with his feet. He leaped into the air and waved his hand, grasping the Lunar Shadow Saber back into his hand firmly.His figure flashed by in the air; only a black saber light could be seen ruthlessly chopping down at Tang Feng. Tang Feng turned pale and left an afterimage behind as he quickly retreated backwards.Xiao Chen did not even bother to look at the afterimage. He twisted his saber, shifted his foot and slashed at five meters to the side.Tang Feng appeared and saw that the black saber edge gently sliced by his throat. He had managed to avoid this danger.However, the wind from the saber cut through some of his skin and flesh, leaving an indistinct scar.Tang Feng\u2019s throat unconsciously tensed up and he felt a slight pain coming from the wound. His originally pale face turned even more terrifying. He felt that he had narrowly escaped from the gates of hell.Xiao Chen stood straight and put away his saber. He looked coldly at him, \u201cScram, and don\u2019t show your face here again! Don\u2019t feel unresigned. I know that you still have some trump cards you have not revealed yet, but so do I.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, don\u2019t hold any expectations in your heart. The two elders from your Tang Clan are already dead, and so is the Zhang Clan\u2019s elder.\u201dWhen Xiao Chen said his final sentence, Tang Feng\u2019s complexion completely changed,\u00a0How could it be? There were four Martial Grand Masters? Could he have killed them all?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A trace of flames actually spread onto the surface of the snow white bow.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Tang Feng glared at Xiao Chen fiercely. His emotions calmed and the flames on the bow vanished.\u201cXiao Chen, I will pay back the humiliation I have suffered today during the Promise of Ten Years. At that time, not only will the Xiao Clan lose the Seven Horn Mountain, but the Xiao Clan will be thoroughly wiped out. This is a certainty; no one will be able to stop it.\u201d\u201cStill reluctant to admit defeat?\u201d Xiao Chen leaped forward and gave Tang Feng a flying kick, then he stepped on him and pointed the Lunar Shadow Saber at his throat, \u201cDo you believe that I will kill you now?\u201d\u201cIf you dare to, then do it,\u201d Tang Feng said stubbornly from the ground.\u201cI think I changed my mind,\u201d Xiao Chen said indifferently, \u201cYou obviously still have some hidden cards to play. Regardless of the reason, now is the best time to kill you. Why should I wait for the Promise of Ten Years and give you an opportunity for revenge?\u201d\u201cWhat are you thinking of doing? Release the Second Young Master. Are you not afraid of causing a war between the Xiao Clan and Tang Clan?\u201d the four people behind Tang Feng said anxiously.\u201cWhat if I kill all of you?\u201dAt this moment, Tang Feng truly felt fear. His voice weakened as he said, \u201cYoung Master Xiao, I was just joking earlier. You thought it was true?\u201dXiao Chen put aside his saber and said indifferently, \u201cGet out of here!\u201dHonestly speaking, Xiao Chen truly wanted to kill off all five of them; especially Tang Feng. He gave Xiao Chen a sense of extreme danger. However, when he thought about it, these five people were likely to have some kind of rescue signal on them.If he were delayed by them and allowed the Tang Clan elders to rush over when they were done with their tasks, they would be in deep trouble.Tang Feng felt extremely dissatisfied as he left; the earlier three arrows had exhausted a great deal of his Essence. Furthermore, he had just obtained this Ice Fire Bow and had not completely mastered it yet.Otherwise, with his character, he would not have left just like that.\u201cElder Brother Xiao Chen, you are awesome!\u201d when the Tang Clan\u2019s group was far away, Xiao Ling`er immediately ran over and flattered him.Xiao Chen looked at Xiao Ling`er somewhat helplessly and said, \u201cI will settle this score with you later. Let\u2019s collect the Demonic Core first.\u201dXiao Ling`er swallowed her saliva in a weird fashion before running to the very front, \u201cI will retrieve this Demonic Core, don\u2019t fight with me for it.\u201d\u201cBang!\u201dXiao Ling`er\u2019s sword smashed on it and the Fire Lizard, that was sealed in ice, shattered into tiny ice fragments. Finding the brain of the Fire Lizard, she split it open with her sword and a black Demonic Core immediately appeared.Xiao Ling`er picked it up joyfully, then looked around furtively before running to Xiao Chen and said with glee, \u201cHow awesome am I? I managed to extract the Demonic Core so quickly.\u201dXiao Chen took the Demonic Core and said, \u201cThis Demonic Core counts towards them, you do not get a share.\u201dXiao Ling`er pouted, dissatisfied as she muttered, \u201cElder Brother Xiao Chen, that is too unfair.\u201d\u201cYou nearly caused the death of your team captain and you still dare talk back?\u201d Xiao Chen said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, we are continuing. You guys don\u2019t want to lose to Xiao Jian\u2019s group right?\u201dUnder Xiao Chen\u2019s lead, the group continued to kill Demonic Beasts. Xiao Chen expanded his Spiritual Sense to the maximum; when he saw a group of Demonic Beasts, he would quickly avoid them.Xiao Chen only focused on bringing the Demonic Beasts over, but he did not make any moves to kill them. The strength of a Rank 2 Demonic Beast was about equivalent to an Inferior Grade Martial Master, but that was not something that made him want to fight.Although Xiao Chen did not say it, everyone understood the reason why Xiao Chen was not fighting. It was done on purpose to temper them; there was nothing to hold a grudge about.Xiao Chen stopped the hunt when it approached dusk. During the day, the group managed to obtain 18 Demonic Cores. Furthermore, there were no major injuries. They all felt relaxed.When they rushed back to the camp, they discovered that Xiao Yulan and the rest had already returned. There was white smoke coming from the kitchen, and a certain fragrance wafted over.\u201c13 Demonic Cores and no major injuries,\u201d Xiao Yu Lan handed the Demonic Cores to Xiao Chen and reported on the situation of their team during the hunt.\u201cWe met the Zhang Clan\u2019s people during the hunt. Zhang Zeyang was leading the group. However, when he saw us, he was startled and then quickly retreated.\u201dXiao Chen smiled, \u201cWe met the Tang Clan people as well. When they saw us, they were surprised.\u201dXiao Yulan trembled with fear, \u201cSeems like the two corpses that appeared in our camp did not happen by chance. What exactly did you see yesterday when you went out?\u201dCoincidentally, dinner was ready and Xiao Chen used the timing to change the topic; he did not wish to answer this question. Xiao Yulan had no choice but to give up.They once more lit a bonfire in the camp after everyone had dinner. They gathered around and discussed the events of the day excitedly. Xiao Chen was surprised by the fact \u00a0that Xiao Jian was training alone and chose not mix with the others.When it was completely dark, Gloomy Forest turned incredibly cold. Gloomy Forest was much more dangerous at night than it was by day. Xiao Chen did not wish for anyone to take any unnecessary risks; after he arranged for the night guard shift, he instructed them to go rest.However, Xiao Chen sneakily got up and prepared to go out once everyone was fast asleep.The Demonic Beasts they fought in the day were only Rank 2; to him, these were not much of a challenge. Thus, he did not make a move. His true Trial started now.Before he got far. With his Spiritual Sense he managed to detect someone following him Looking carefully, he discovered that it was Xiao Jian. Xiao Chen looked at the direction he was going and realized that it was to the south of the camp, so he did not worry about him.With Xiao Jian\u2019s strength, it should not be a problem for him to train alone in Gloomy Forest. Furthermore, Xiao Chen could not think of any way to stop him.Xiao Chen collected himself and headed east of the camp. Before he traveled far, a Patterned Demonic Panther appeared within the range of his Spiritual Sense. This Patterned Demonic Panther was a Rank 3 Demonic Beast; its strength was equivalent to a peak Martial Master. It was a perfect target for Xiao Chen to use for his Trial.Pushing his feet off the ground, Xiao Chen leaped up gently and landed on a tree branch. He calmly observed the Patterned Demonic Panther on the ground.This Patterned Demonic Panther was more than two meters tall and its body was completely black. It looked very similar to the Panthers on Earth, but its eyes were blood-red. This was a special characteristic of Demonic Beasts.Xiao Chen could feel a surging, baleful aura coming from the Patterned Demonic Panther, even when he was tens of meters away. It caused him to shiver even though it was not cold.\u201cCrack!\u201dXiao Chen accidentally broke a small tree branch. The Patterned Demonic Panther\u2019s ear twitched and it heard the tiny sound. It\u2019s blood-red eyes looked in Xiao Chen\u2019s direction.Its vision was unobscured by the darkness, so Xiao Chen was discovered immediately. It roared, and a terrifying sound wave attacked in Xiao Chen\u2019s direction.\u201cBo!\u201dA huge energy accompanied the sound wave and headed towards Xiao Chen. In the area where it passed the huge, broad trees of Gloomy Forest trembled, and countless leaves fell to the ground.Xiao Chen was startled. This sound wave attack had a wide range and was mighty; it had almost no weak points.However, there were still a couple.Xiao Chen executed the Lightning Evasion and his body appeared behind the Patterned Demonic Panther, avoiding the sound wave attack. With the Lightning Evasion, the sound wave attack was not much of a threat to Xiao Chen.The Patterned Demonic Panther immediately sensed Xiao Chen\u2019s location, so it turned and pounced at him. A black Qi gathered in its right claw as it ruthlessly slashed at Xiao Chen.\u201cFlight On Wings, One Line Chop.\u201dXiao Chen did not dare to be careless and used a Martial Technique to clash with it. This was because he felt that the force behind the black Qi was very terrifying; if he was careless, he would suffer greatly.\u201cPu Chi!\u201dThe force from the Patterned Demonic Panther\u2019s right claw caused him to be pushed back a few steps. However, when it was hit by the One Line Chop, it did not seem to feel any discomfort.As Xiao Chen was pushed back, the Patterned Demonic Panther pressed in closely, not giving up its advantage. A towering figure of at least two meters tall, and with blood-red eyes, glared at Xiao Chen from above. A\u00a0strong oppression pressured\u00a0Xiao Chen.Purple Thunder True Fire, shoot!Xiao Chen fired out a purple flame, the flames leaving behind a trail as they attacked the body of the Patterned Demonic Panther. A pool of purple blood flowed out from the beast.The Patterned Demonic Panther cried out in pain but the black Qi quickly put out the purple flames. It opened its jaws wide and roared loudly; a terrifying sound wave swept through the area again.Heavenly Lightning Shield!Sensing imminent danger, Xiao Chen executed the Heavenly Lightning Shield. However, it was not very effective against this strange sound wave attack, so it still managed to penetrate through Xiao Chen\u2019s Heavenly Lightning Shield.Some blood leaked out the corner of Xiao Chen\u2019s mouth, and his ears had gone temporarily deaf. Xiao Chen wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and dissipated the Heavenly Lightning Shield. His eyes were filled with a strong killing intent.This beast was too infuriating; even Tang Feng did not manage to injure him to this extent.\u201cFlight On Wings, Disordered Dance of a Thousand Years!\u201dXiao Chen had attempted to execute this move many times before, but he was only successful about 50 percent of the time. This was because he still did not have a deep understanding of the Battle Sage Origins\u2019 Changing Character Formula.However, now he could not be bothered so much about that. He sank his consciousness into his Dantian and tried to recall the scene of the battle with Zhang He. Each and every move of Zhang He appeared in Xiao Chen\u2019s mind, like a video replaying itself.Comprehending them in his heart, the Changing Character Formula circulated quietly within.Xiao Chen suddenly executed the move, his figure appearing in the air and countless saber lights fired out. Xiao Chen\u2019s posture kept changing in midair as he successfully executed the move.The sword light carried the strength of the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit; relentlessly striking the body of the Patterned Demonic Panther. Purple blood kept spurting from it. The Patterned Demonic Panther roared in pain, trying to grab at Xiao Chen in midair, but was unable to catch him.\u201cDie!\u201dAfter the technique was used, a surge of energy came from the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit; his originally falling body rose higher. An electrical light was released from the Lunar Shadow Saber, displaying its malevolent side. The Rank 6 Demonic Core hacked at the Patterned Demonic Panther with a boundless might.The Patterned Demonic Panther was immediately hacked into two halves. When Xiao Chen descended, he sighed in relief. He felt disappointed; aside from its terrifying sound wave attack, the rest of its attributes were not very strong.Xiao Chen left after he extracted the Rank 3 Demonic Core from its brain. When he looked for his next target, a dark shadow flew by above his head.Raising his head to take a look, Xiao Chen was surprised. This dark shadow was the person Xiao Chen saw controlling the Demonic Beast the previous night.\u201cWoosh!\u201dAnother white shadow flew by above his head. This was true flight, and not just jumping from tree branch to tree branch.\u201cA Martial King expert!\u201d Xiao Chen looked at the white shadow, and exclaimed in shock.\u201cHu!\u201dAs Xiao Chen was stunned, that dark shadow stepped on the huge bird and flew towards Xiao Chen. Xiao Chen, still on the ground, was obviously his target.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xiao Chen felt like he was being glared at with a pair of gloomy eyes. If he so much as moved an inch, he would be killed immediately.\u201cShua!\u201dThe earlier white shadow also rushed over. Xiao Chen stared at the white shadow and felt his mind enter into a state of unrest; it was extremely disturbing for him.The white shadow in the air was a youthful looking girl.She was holding a two-meter long, golden spear in her hands. She had a delicate face that could represent the pinnacle of beauty, her skin was as smooth as jade, her facial appearance was picturesque, and her eyes were like stars.Xiao Chen had never seen such a exquisite girl before. There were no words in the world that could describe her beauty. She was like a piece of jade that had formed naturally and required no polishing.\u201cCommander, you have chased me for ten days and ten nights already. From Jiangfeng City on the outskirts of the Great Qin Nation to this tiny Mohe City. Are you truly not willing to let me off?\u201dThe dark figure said in a sullen tone with a hint of dissatisfaction in his voice, \u201cJust because I awaken a Demonic Beast Martial Spirit? Commander, ever since you came to the border station, I have already been through more than a hundred battles of various scales with you. There are more than a hundred scars left on my body, or have you forgotten it?\u201dThe devastating beauty revealed a painful expression on her face, causing one to be unable to bear seeing it. Her red lips gently parted and she said with a delicate voice, \u201cXiao Hei, I have never thought of killing you before. Even though you cultivated a Demonic Beast Martial Spirit and killed three of your comrades. I only wish to exterminate your Demonic Beast Martial Spirit.\u201d[TL note: Chinese character for the Xiao in Xiao Hei is not the same as the one for Xiao Chen. It means small and is usually used in the situation of a nickname. So in this case, this name means little black.]\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d The dark figure laughed loudly, \u201c You do not want to kill me, and yet you used an Earth Rank Martial Technique, Boundless Azure Sea. If I had not been fortunate, I would have died long ago.\u201d\u201cSo be it. Since you want to kill me, then I shall not take into account our old relationship and send you to meet with our three dead comrades.\u201dA saber appeared in the dark figure\u2019s hand as he rode on the huge bird and rushed at the girl. A black rift actually appeared in the air as the claws of the bird slashed at her.After the black bird attacked, the dark figure leaped off and sent a black saber light at the girl.Xiao Chen was surprised; it was clear that this dark figure was not as strong as the girl in white. This could easily be seen from the fact that he needed to ride the bird to fly, while the girl in white could fly without any assistance.However, with the huge bird below him also\u00a0attacking, it was a situation of two versus one. It was possible that this girl in white might suffer a disadvantage.But, things did not go as Xiao Chen expected. The girl in white grasped her golden spear and shook it; nine golden dragons appeared behind her back, hissing incessantly.The girl's body gave off a supreme imperial might. Under such pressure, Xiao Chen almost knelt and prostrated himself. Suddenly, streams of the ancient Azure Dragon\u2019s aura were emitted by Xiao Chen\u2019s body. That boundless might instantly felt as if it did not exist, and Xiao Chen was able to relax.With the nine dragons protecting her body, the spatial tears caused by the black bird were instantly soothed. The long spear suddenly turned and attacked the dark figure.The dark figure somersaulted in the air, resolving the surging dragon Qi. The black bird in front of him seemed to be telepathically connected to him, and appeared precisely at his feet.The nine dragons circled in the air as the speed of the battle between the two increased. Their bodies rose continuously up, further into the sky, as they released copious amounts of energy. The surrounding trees were broken at their trunks and instantly turned into powder.There was an endless hissing of the dragons and a boundless black Qi extending out. The golden Qi and black Qi clashed violently in the air.Xiao Chen\u2019s heart was filled with incessant grievances. These two people were peak experts; the energy that they released would cause him to be severely injured if any of it landed on Xiao Chen\u2019s body.Xiao Chen could not help but execute the Heavenly Lightning Shield to defend against the energy that would descend from the sky from time to time. Even though, his internal organs were shaken, causing his Qi and blood to be in turmoil.Very soon, Xiao Chen could no longer clearly see their shadows. Via Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense, it was obvious that the girl\u2019s strength was superior. However, when they were fighting, he realized she was not using it all.It was obvious that she was under some kind of constraint. The true might of the nine dragons was not able to be fully unleashed.\u201cYe Chenzhou, have you descended to such a level? To involve a Martial Disciple in our fight. Where is your pride?\u201d the melodious voice of the girl was filled with a boundless anger as the two of them slowly descended.Ye Chenzhou smiled sullenly, \u201cPride? As the commander, of course, you have pride. For me, it would be even difficult for me to stay alive. What is the point of pride? If you want to kill me, then kill this fellow first. Let me see your pride.\u201dXiao Chen finally understood why the girl in white was under some kind of constraints; it was actually because of him. However, even if he wanted to leave, he could not; the dark figure had used his Qi to lock him down.As long as he made any strange movements, he would be killed on the spot.\u201cHow despicable!\u201d the girl in white said through clenched teeth.She waved the long spear in the air and the nine dragons behind her trembled, circling around the spear. With a shout she thrust it at Ye Chenzhou, creating a shadow of a dragon in the air.\u201cDang!\u201dYe Chenzhou used his saber to block this attack but the dragon shadow circling the spear dived down. Ye Chenzhou was startled and waved the saber nine times.Nine streams of surging saber Qi collided intensely with dragon shadow. Streams of energy scattered in all directions. Xiao Chen, who was below, was shaken and immediately vomited a mouthful of blood.\u201cBoundless Azure Sea!\u201dThe girl in white shouted gently and a boundless sea appeared behind her. An Azure Dragon jumped out from the sea and rushed at Ye Chenzhou with a boundless energy.Ye Chenzhou\u2019s mind worked very quickly, and he stepped on the huge bird with his right foot. They then quickly flew downwards, suddenly hovering just one meter above Xiao Chen\u2019s head.The girl in white frowned; she never expected that he would be so despicable. Shaking the spear in the air, the Azure Dragon just brushed past him.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe Azure Dragon flew past and landed on the ground. There was a shocking explosion and everything within a hundred meters was blasted into oblivion, turning the area into ruins.Ye Chenzhou laughed strangely, taking advantage of the girl in white, changing the direction of her move, his body turned into a streak of black lightning as he landed a palm on her right shoulder.\u201cPu Ci!\u201dAnother saber light flashed; the girl in white was not able to evade in time, and with struck by numerous black colored saber lights. Her white clothes were instantly covered with bloodstains. Ye Chenzhou kicked her, and the girl in white fell towards the ground.Ye Chenzhou laughed loudly, \u201cThis is your pride, changing your move and showing an opening at the last minute. Your pride will only cause you the die at my hands. However, your life is originally going to be short anyway. Thinking about it, there would not be too much regrets for you to die at my hands today.Ye Chenzhou kept laughing in midair; he looked maniacal. The black Qi on his body turn even denser. This was the boundless Demonic Qi, which had an endless energy.\u201cGo die!\u201dYe Chenzhou shouted loudly and descended from the sky, a saber light tens of meters long given off by the blade. The black bird under him turned into a shadow and entered his body. At the same time, an ancient Demon Lord appeared behind him holding a saber and hacking downwards.The girl in white looked at Ye Chenzhou, who was possessed by the Demon Lord, and her face revealed an expression of despair,\u00a0Am I going to die?\u201cFlight On Wings, Moon Bright Like Fire.\u201dIt must succeed, it had to succeed!\u00a0Xiao Chen prayed very hard in his heart. When the girl in white was attacked, Xiao Chen had already decided to take action. Since he was going to die, he might as well try to do something.What he hated the most was someone who bullied women. Furthermore, he did not wish to owe such a favor to a girl. If the girl in front of him died because of him, it would become his heart demon for the rest of his life.A full moon rose slowly from the edge of the sky. Xiao Chen was very happy that it managed to succeed at this critical moment.Ye Chenzhou felt a dangerous aura, and quickly turned his head to look. He noticed that a full moon appeared in the sky without him noticing. It was as calm as still water as it fell rapidly towards him.A strong aura accompanied the moon as it fell. When the round moon got closer, it had already turned into a huge, glowing ball emitting a boundless radiance.Ye Chenzhou revealed a startled expression as he quickly changed the direction of his saber. He turned his body and chopped at the round moon falling towards him.A seven-meter long saber light and the Demonic Weapon in the hands of the Demon Lord struck the round moon. When the two huge forces collided, it instantly let out a loud sound that shook the heavens.The radiance faded and the heaven shaking Qi wave scattered everywhere. With a \u2018shua\u2019 sound, the Qi wave caused all the ancient trees in Gloomy Forest that it passed to break.Xiao Chen was knocked back by the Qi wave and he landed on the ground. He rolled over for a few meters before he stopped. However, Ye Chenzhou took three urgent steps back. Each step he took left behind a 66-centimeter pit on the ground.Before Ye Chenzhou established himself, a golden flame flew at him quickly. There seemed to be a tiny flood dragon swimming within that golden flame.The golden fire pierced Ye Chenzhou\u2019s heart with a \u2018bang\u2019. He revealed an extremely painful expression. Holding his chest in disbelief, he said, \u201cHe actually gave you a strand of Dragon Fire.\u201dThe Black Qi in his body continually dissipated, and his expression was distorted. The black bird appeared once again, and he rode on it, rapidly fleeing into the distance.The two people on the ground had no ability to continue fighting. They could only watch as Ye Chenzhou fled in a sorry state.Xiao Chen swallowed a Blood Replenishing Pill, then slowly walked towards the girl in white. He discovered that she had fainted. Her white clothes were ripped in many places by the saber light, exposing her snow-white skin.There was even some black Qi eating away at her skin, causing her to reveal a pained expression even though she was unconscious. Her beautiful face was pale, completely devoid of blood; it was sad and beautiful.Xiao Chen thought for awhile, then took out a few Blood Replenishing Pills and crushed them, spreading them on her wounds. When the green medicine liquid entered her wounds, the black Qi dissipated significantly. Xiao Chen felt joy in his heart.As he spread the medicine on her, he noticed that the girl's skin was as pure white as snow, and was extremely smooth. Even with Xiao Chen\u2019s shocking determination, he could not help but feel a ripple in his heart.After he spread the medicine on all the wounds, only a bra was left on the girl's body. It was something that he could not help but do, there were many saber wounds on the girl\u2019s body. If he did not remove her clothes, he would have no way to apply the medicine.However, the bras of this world were much tighter than that of his previous world, and it would not even seem like anything erotic.The golden longevity lock in front of her chest attracted Xiao Chen\u2019s attention. Remembering Ye Chenzhou say that she did not have long to live, he was startled,\u00a0Could it be that such a beautiful women would die soon?Xiao Chen shook his head and pushed this question to the back of his mind. The main problem now was how to deal with her. He definitely could not leave her here. After causing such a huge commotion in Gloomy Forest, Demonic Beasts would surely be attracted near.This girl ended up in such a state because of him, so Xiao Chen would definitely not leave her alone.However, it would not be convenient for him to bring her back to the camp. Suddenly, his gaze fell onto his Universe Ring.\u00a0Xiao Chen smiled gently; he already had a good idea.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Living things could be put into it as well, as long as they were willing or unconscious. This was the might of the magic treasure.Seeing the ruins around him, Xiao Chen was no longer in a mood to carry on hunting. Furthermore, after they had caused such a huge commotion, there would be many strong Demonic Beasts that would be attracted. If he remained here, death would be the only thing awaiting him.When Xiao Chen returned, Xiao Yulan and the others were all awake and at the campgrounds already. Apparently, the commotion from earlier had woken them up.\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, what did you go out to do? Everyone was worried about you,\u201d Xiao Yulan said to Xiao Chen somewhat angrily.Xiao Chen blushed with shame, \u201cNothing, I just felt something, so I went out to check.\u201d\u201cHowever, the people on night watch said they did not see you. If you are going out, you should say something,\u201d Xiao Yulan said as she pointed at two people.Xiao Chen felt a headache coming on suddenly as he noticed Xiao Jian in the crowd, and hurriedly said, \u201cI told Xiao Jian, isn\u2019t that right Xiao Jian?\u201dXiao Jian was startled and nodded his head, \u201cEn, he indeed told me about it.\u201dXiao Chen smiled, \u201cI did not lie to you right? Go and sleep. The night watch should continue their shift. I just checked it out, and it was nothing.\u201dOn the second day of the trial, Xiao Chen was afraid they would run into that terrifying dark figure. He decided that the ten of them would carry out their activities together.The scene of that dark figure consuming the internal organs of another person to treat his own injuries left a deep impression on Xiao Chen. Furthermore, the dark figure was injured so heavily last night, Xiao Chen did not dare to risk splitting up the group.Over the next two days, they met Rank 3 and Rank 4 Demonic Beasts running out suddenly during their trial. Although Xiao Chen used his Spiritual Sense to avoid them, he felt that something was not right.\u201cBang! Bang!\u201dOn the third day of the trial, Xiao Chen felt a banging sound coming from his Universe Ring. He was dazzled; it seems like the space in the Universe Ring was about to shatter.It seemed that the girl in white was about to wake up. He had been so busy in the days leading the group and training himself at night that he forgot about this.Xiao Chen quickly took out all the Rank 2 Demonic Cores from the Universe Ring. He was afraid that if he did not take them out, they would be destroyed by the girl in there. If that happened, it would be a great pity. With the effort of the past few days, they were already nearing two hundred Demonic Cores.\u201cCousin Yulan, I entrust these items to you first; you should also hang on to the Demonic Core we obtain later. I have to leave for a bit.\u201dXiao Yulan looked at Xiao Chen\u2019s action in shock, \u201cCousin Xiao Chen, what are you doing? We are about to depart.\u201d\u201cI have no time to explain; I have to leave soon,\u201d Xiao Chen quickly said. There was a drop of his blood essence in the Universe Ring. Every time there was a bang, it felt like an explosion going off in his mind.The remaining people saw Xiao Chen execute the Lightning Evasion and was quickly very far away. They did not understand what was happening. Xiao Yulan stomped on the ground angrily as she watched his swiftly disappearing figure.\u2026After Xiao Chen went far enough away and ensured there was no one around, he released the girl from the Universe Ring.\u201cScoundrel! Die!\u201d the girl held her golden spear, and immediately attacked Xiao Chen when he was released her.This attack that was filled with anger and contained a flourishing energy. It flew at Xiao Chen ruthlessly, startling him, and causing him to jump in a hurry to evade.\u201cHey hey, check yourself first to see if you lost anything before calling me a scoundrel,\u201d Xiao Chen hurriedly said when he saw that she was preparing to make another move.The girl saw that she was only left with a bra on her body and a tinge of red appeared on her pale face, \u201cThings have already gotten this far and you still want to deny it. I\u2019ll kill you!\u201dShe grasped the golden spear in her hands once again, and a thick killing intent appeared in her eyes; she was preparing to make a move.Xiao Chen saw that there was no use explaining. This girl had strong battle capabilities. He had expected this earlier, and already prepared to run.\u201cBang!\u201dThere was the sound of someone tripping behind him. Xiao Chen turned his head to take a look, and discovered that before the girl made a move, she fell on the ground. He quickly turned around and walked over.\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d the girl said fiercely.Xiao Chen said helplessly, \u201cI won\u2019t touch you, I promise. I just want to tell you I really am not a scoundrel. Look at the wounds on your body; see if there are any scars left. I only applied some medicine to you. I did not do anything else.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look at me so fiercely. Consider your situation. If I truly wanted to do anything to you, you would have no way to resist.\u201dAfter a long time, the girl finally said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll believe you once. However, why did you imprison me in that space?\u201dXiao Chen hurriedly explained his situation to her before the girl finally believed him, \u201cHelp me up first; I trust you now.\u201dXiao Chen released his breath in relief and helped her up, then he leaned on a tree, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I have not asked you for your name yet.\u201d\u201cName? I\u2019m Yue Ying,\u201d the girl said gently. After she said that, a rumbling sound came from her stomach. She could not help but blush.After Xiao Chen heard it, he could not help but smile and took out a Fasting Pill from the Universe Ring, \u201cEat this. After you eat this, you will not be hungry.\u201dReceiving the Fasting Pill, Yue Ying did not hesitate and swallowed it. After a short while, she felt that her empty stomach did not feel hungry anymore. She said in surprise, \u201cYou are an alchemist? This pill is miraculous.\u201dXiao Chen nodded his head, \u201cYou are really daring; are you not afraid that I gave you poison?\u201dAt this point in time, Yue Ying already recovered some of her strength. She got up and stretched her body as she said, \u201cSince I have chosen to believe you, I will not hesitate. Furthermore, if I want to kill you, as long as I have a breath left, it would be easy for me to do so.\u201dXiao Chen quietly smacked his lips,\u00a0Why was it that the women he met were all so strong? Ao Jiao was strong and now there is this Yue Ying. It was suffocating.\u201cHow long was I in that space for?\u201d Yue Ying asked suddenly.\u201cAbout three days.\u201dYue Ying\u2019s complexion changed, \u201cOh no! Those people from the Qizi County have probably been killed by Ye Chenzhou already. You better bring the people participating in the trial away quickly. The Demonic Beasts are about to attack.\u201dXiao Chen thought about it. He remembered that he kept running into higher ranked Demonic Beast in the past few days,\u00a0Could it be that those experts that the Qizi County sent to the core of Gloomy Forest were all dead?\u201cHu Chi!\u201dSuddenly, there were three different colored flames rising into the dark sky of Gloomy Forest. These were the emergency signals of the Zhang Clan, Xiao Clan, and Tang Clan.What happened? Why did the three clans release emergency signals at the same time?\u00a0Xiao Chen thought puzzledly.\u201cI\u2019m going back, what are you going to do?\u201d Xiao Chen said to Yue Ying.Yue Ying smiled indifferently, \u201cGo. I\u2019m not seriously injured. Just that I have exhausted myself too much by using that technique. I just need to recuperate for one hour, and I will be able to leave.\u201dXiao Chen thought for awhile before saying, \u201cThen let me guard you for an hour.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Yue Ying said sincerely. She was currently at her weakest, and needed someone to guard her.Yue Ying sat down cross-legged, and nine dragon shadows circled around her. Streams of golden dragon Qi were emitted from her body continuously. Her aura grew stronger, bit by bit.After an hour, Yue Ying suddenly opened her eyes. All her previous injuries were healed. She no longer gave off the weak feeling she had before; she was now filled with a tyrannical aura.She nodded at Xiao Chen, and a small golden dragon entered into Xiao Chen\u2019s body. It swam in his body for a cycle, before integrating with the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit.\u201cYou saved my life. When necessary, this dragon Qi will protect your life,\u201d after she said that, she soared into the sky and flew into the distance, leaving Xiao Chen with the sight of a beautiful figure.Xiao Chen was not reluctant to leave. Based on the fact that she could use Dragon Flames, Xiao Chen had guessed her identity. Yue Ying, when he reversed her name, it was Ying Yue. It was obvious that she was from the imperial family of the Great Qin Nation. The distance between him and her was too far.After retrieving his gaze, Xiao Chen headed back towards the Xiao Clan camp site. The three clans fired off emergency signals together; something major must have happened.\u201cWhy is there no one here at all?\u201dWhen Xiao Chen rushed to the camp, he discovered that the campsite had been packed up. Even the Demonic Beast corpses in the storehouse were all taken away.Could they have retreated already?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thinking of what Yue Ying said, he guessed that the people of Qizi County had received news and would end this trial early.When he was about to leave, he suddenly felt a sense of danger. He released his Spiritual Sense, and he discovered a cultivator hiding in a tree to the left, about twenty meters high.This cultivator had withdrawn all his aura, and was glaring at Xiao Chen. He was waiting for an opportunity to kill Xiao Chen.Xiao Chen controlled his Spiritual Sense, and after he saw him clearly, he could not help but laugh in his heart. The person was a Martial Grand Master of the Zhang Clan. He should have arrived together with the two elders of the Tang Clan. He just did not know how this person managed to avoid being killed by Ye Chenzhou.However, his aura seemed to be quite weak. Due to avoiding Ye Chenzhou for the past few days, he had exhausted a significant amount of Essence. It was obvious that he had not managed to get any decent rest.In his current state, he actually did not leave early. Instead, he even wanted to kill me. This goes to show how much the Zhang Clan hates me,\u00a0Xiao Chen thought to himself.With this man\u2019s current state he was, at best, only at half his usual strength. Xiao Chen did not wish to escape. To him, this was a suitable trial for him. This was much more interesting than a Demonic Beast.He immediately went for the first move. A lightning bolt flashed by, and Xiao Chen suddenly appeared behind the man. The Lunar Shadow Saber flashed with a brilliant light, and the boundless might of the Rank 6 Demonic Core pervaded the surroundings.The man turned his head around to see Xiao Chen\u2019s smiling face. The look of amazement was clear on his face; he had no idea how Xiao Chen knew he was hiding there.\u2026\u2026\u2026Outside Gloomy Forest, the sun hung high in the sky, bathing everything in sunlight.\u201cFather, why did you call us back? Cousin Xiao Chen has not come out yet,\u201d Xiao Yulan said to Xiao Qiang with clear dissatisfaction.Shortly after Xiao Chen left, Xiao Qiang brought four of the Xiao Clan\u2019s Martial Grand Masters to the Xiao Clan campsite. He said that the trial was ending early, and then brought everyone out of the forest immediately.Xiao Qiang frowned, \u201cAside from a Martial Grand Master who escaped, all the experts that the Qizi County sent to the core of Gloomy Forest died; even the Martial Saint expert they sent died as well.\u201dThe crowd behind inhaled sharply, \u201cEven a Martial Saint expert died?! Are the Demonic Beasts of Gloomy Forest so terrifying?\u201d\u201cHe was killed by humans, not at the hands of Demonic Beasts. Furthermore, the way he died was extremely horrifying. Qizi County already reported this matter to the imperial household. This is not something that we can solve by having us to help. Thus, the trial has been canceled.\u201d Xiao Qiang explained.Xiao Yulan\u2019s face changed slightly and she said anxiously, \u201cThen wouldn't that mean that Cousin Xiao Chen is in grave danger? I have to go in and look for him.\u201d\u201cPreposterous!\u201d Xiao Qiang shouted sternly, \u201cDo you remember what happened at Seven Horn Mountain? Do you think that Xiao Chen will die so easily? If he wishes to escape, even a Martial Saint would not be able to catch him. If you go in, you will just be a burden to him.\u201dXiao Yulan\u2019s eyes turned red, but she did not say anything.\u201cElder Xiao, what are you doing? Scolding someone? That\u2019s not good,\u201d the Tang Clan head brought a group of people along as he walked over, \u201cWhere is the Second Young Master of your clan? How come I don\u2019t see him? Did the Demonic Beasts eat him up?\u201dXiao Qiang looked at Tang Tian coldly and sneered, \u201cDon\u2019t think that I do not know about what you have done in Gloomy Forest. Too bad that the heavens have eyes, and you lost two elder leveled people for nothing.\u201dTang\u2019s complexion changed, and then he smiled, \u201cI do not understand what Elder Xiao is talking about. However, although this trial has ended early, we still have to compare the results of our three clans. I wonder how many Demonic Cores the Xiao Clan managed to collect?\u201d\u201cLater, when the City Lord arrives, I will report it to him personally. When that happens, I hope that the number that the Tang Clan reports is not too low.\u201dThe Xiao Clan managed to obtain a total of 180 Rank 2 Demonic Cores. Xiao Qiang was very satisfied with them achieving such a result despite having only three days. Thus he was not afraid of Tang Tian\u2019s mockings.Not much later, the City Lord Dugu Feng called the people of the three clans over. He had a relaxed expression on his face, as though the matters of Gloomy Forest did not involve him.Dugu Feng smiled, \u201cAlthough there were some problems with this trial and we had to end it early, we will still follow the old rules. The competition between your three clans will continue. I wonder if there is anyone who managed to surpass the Xiao Clan; they have been first for the past few times.\u201cLet us start with the Zhang Clan. I wonder how many Demonic Cores they obtained?\u201dThe Zhang Clan Head\u2019s complexion turned extremely unsightly when he heard this. This time, the strongest disciple of their Zhang Clan did not show up due to he and his Martial Spirit being injured. They did not manage to obtain many cores. However, since the City Lord asked, they had to report it.\u201cThe Zhang Clan managed to obtain a total of 50 Rank 2 Demonic Cores on this trip,\u201d the Zhang Clan Head said.Dugu Feng was not surprised at this result. Smiling gently, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Zhang He did not come, so it is pretty good for you to obtain such results already.\u201d\u201cNext up, let\u2019s have the Tang Clan report their numbers. I still have a certain amount of expectations for the Tang Clan.\u201dTang Tian smiled indifferently, \u201cCity Lord speaks too highly of us. This time, the Tang Clan obtained a total of 100 Rank 2 Demonic Cores.\u201dAfter Tang Tian finished, he looked at Xiao Qiang, the meaning in his eyes obvious: it is time for you to report your numbers.Xiao Qiang breathed out in relief when he heard the Tang Clan\u2019s report. Seeing the glance the City Lord was casting at him, Xiao Qiang said, \u201cIn this trial, the Xiao Clan has obtained\u2026\u00a0a total of 180 Rank 2 Demonic Cores.\u201dDugu Feng laughed loudly when he heard this, \u201cLooks like the Xiao Clan has a deep foundation. Congratulations, it seems that the Xiao Clan won the trial again.\u201dTang Tian revealed a deep smile, \u201cCity Lord, don't be in sure a hurry to congratulate them. Tang Feng, show your spoils to the City Lord.\u201dTang Feng walked up when he heard this and took out six Demonic Cores, placing them in front of the City Lord. The glow of these six Demonic Cores was incredibly deep. It was clearly different from the Rank 2 Demonic Cores.Someone beside him exclaimed out in surprise, \u201cThese are Rank 3 Demonic Cores.\u201d\u201cIndeed, they are really Rank 3 Demonic Cores!\u201d said one of the people beside as he picked up one of the Demonic Cores and examined it closely.A Rank 3 Demonic Beast had a strength equivalent to a Martial Grand Master. This Tang Feng was actually able to take out six Rank 3 Demonic Beasts; it was truly unbelievable.\u201cMohe City has held so many trials, yet I have never heard that there was anyone who managed to obtain Rank 3 Demonic Cores in the past. It seems that the Tang Clan will be first this time, surpassing the Xiao Clan!\u201d\u201cIndeed, the even more astonishing thing is that he is only a Superior Grade Martial Disciple. With this level of strength now, if he advanced, there would be no one who could beat him in the following Promise of Ten Years.\u201dDugu Feng looked carefully at the Rank 3 Demonic Cores Tang Feng handed over. In the end, he said gently, \u201cSeems that the Xiao Clan is not able to retain the first place this time. The value of these Rank 3 Demonic Cores is equivalent to 100 Rank 2 Demonic Cores.\u201dTang Tian had a smug look on his face as he looked at Xiao Qiang, \u201cElder Xiao, my apologies. Seems like the first place for this trial belongs to my Tang Clan.\u201dAfter suppressing the Xiao Clan in this trial, and if they were able to defeat the Xiao Clan in the Promise of Ten Years, the prestige of the Xiao Clan would hit rock bottom.All those who had business or an alliance with the Xiao Clan would see the situation and break off contact with them. When that happens, the Xiao Clan will be in dire straits.Xiao Qiang\u2019s complexion was very unsightly. He originally thought that it was a sure win situation, yet, he was ruthlessly slapped in the face. Tang Tian\u2019s move was too vicious.All the Xiao Clan disciples had a very unsightly complexion too. This trial represented the clan\u2019s reputation. They all felt responsible for not obtaining the first place. Even the normally eccentric Xiao Ling`er was biting her lips with a depressed expression.At this time, Xiao Jian stepped out from the crowd and slowly walked to the City Lord. He took out five Demonic Cores and said indifferently, \u201cI have also obtained five Rank 3 Demonic Cores. City Lord, please verify it.\u201dAfter he said that, he walked to the back without saying anything else. His expression was as calm as still water, resulting in others not being able to guess what he was thinking.\u201cIt\u2019s Xiao Jian; could it be that he obtained Rank 3 Demonic Cores too?\u201d\u201cThis person was once the number one youth in Mohe City. Did he really obtain Rank 3 Demonic Cores?\u201d\u201cI heard that after he got humiliated by Zhang He, he shut himself in. To think that he was able to surprise us like this. I wonder if he could pull the Xiao Clan out of defeat.\u201d\u201cIt would be difficult. After he only took out five Rank 3 Demonic Cores; Tang Feng took out six.\u201dThe people beside the City Lord all broke out in discussion. No one had expected the results of this trial would surprise them, not once, but twice now.Dugu Feng muttered to himself for a moment before saying, \u201cThese five Demonic Cores are indeed Rank 3. The Tang Clan had one more Rank 3 than the Xiao Clan, but the Xiao Clan had 80 more Rank 2 Demonic Core than the Tang Clan. After deliberating about it, I feel that we should call it a draw. What do you think?\u201dXiao Qiang smiled gently to show that this result was acceptable to him. He originally thought that they would lose, but who knew they could turn things around? It was already pretty good for them to obtain a draw.Tang Tian was now in a very bad mood. He said with some dissatisfaction, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much higher is the value of a Rank 3 Demonic Core compared to a Rank 2, but in my opinion, it would definitely be at least worth 100 Rank 2 Demonic Cores.\u201dXiao Qiang ridiculed him, \u201cAre they worth 100 just because you say they are worth 100? Who do you think you are? The Pavillion Master of Linlang Pavilion? In your opinion? Well, in my opinion, they are only worth 50; what can you do about that?\u201dTang Tian said angrily, \u201cIn any case, I am not accepting a draw. After we return, I will be declaring and publicizing that the Tang Clan obtained first in this trial.\u201dDugu Feng was not in a tight spot. With such a result, he was not sure how to many an accurate judgement. After all, he was not an expert on appraising the value of \u00a0Demonic Cores.\u201cWell I am of the opinion that it is indeed not a draw, but the one losing is you, the Tang Clan.\u201dWho was it that spoke that? His tone was full of arrogance.The crowd turned their heads to take a look, but all they saw was the figure of a youth slowly walking from the entrance of Gloomy Forest. They squinted their eyes, but a blinding bright light appeared suddenly.He was carrying a round package behind his bag. The sun was shining on his face, making that almost\u00a0handsome\u00a0face look radiant. His voice was not loud, but everyone heard him clearly.\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, you are finally back.\u201d\u201cElder Brother Xiao Chen, come quickly and help Ling`er take revenge.\u201d[TL note: I believe the above dialogue was by Xiao Ling`er herself. She sometimes refer to herself in the third person.]\u201cCaptain, \u2026\u201dThe Xiao Clan disciples who had followed him all ran over joyfully, and Xiao Chen greeted them. He walked to the front of Tang Tian with a smiling face, staring at him without fear.\u201cSince you do not want a draw, then I will make you accept your defeat wholeheartedly.\u201dWith a wave of his hand, Xiao Chen took out three Demonic Cores, \u201cThese are the Demonic Cores from the Rank Three Demonic Beast, Patterned Demonic Panther. There is a total of three.\u201d\u201cThese are the Demonic Cores of the Rank 3 Demonic Beast, Demonic Lunar Blood Monkey, there are also three of them.\u201d\u201cThese are the Demonic Cores of the Rank 3 Demonic Beast, Sword-Tailed Dragon. There is a total of four.\u201dEvery time Xiao Chen read out a Demonic Beast\u2019s name, the surrounding people would let out a cry of surprise. In the end, Xiao Chen took out Demonic Cores from eight different Demonic Beasts; there were at least three of each kind.\u201cWhat else would you like to say? Tang Tian, your Tang Clan will never surpass the Xiao Clan. If you wish to be first, you have to ask me to see if I would allow that to happen first,\u201d Xiao Chen said coldly as he looked at the stunned Tang Tian.The people from the Xiao Clan felt relieved. As they looked at Tang Tian\u2019s speechless face, they felt great in their hearts.Xiao Chen said indifferently, \u201cIf you are still not convinced of your loss, the package behind me is worth another 100 Rank 2 Demonic Cores.Xiao Chen opened up that round package after that statement. He then threw it onto the floor, and a round head rolled on the floor. His eyes were open, and it was clear that he died with a remaining grievance.\u201cThat is an elder from the Zhang Clan. How was he killed by Xiao Chen? According to the rules, he should not even be in Gloomy Forest,\u201d the surrounding people all took a deep breath.\u201cWhat!\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201dTang Tian and the Zhang Clan head exclaimed in surprise at the same time, and their expressions changed drastically. There was fear in their eyes as they looked at Xiao Chen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The group of Zhang Clan members rushed forward, as though they intended to start a fight.The First Elder Xiao Qiang quickly rushed forward. The group of Xiao Clan cultivators also fearlessly rushed forward. Xiao Chen smiled coldly, \u201cThey wanted to kill me, why should I not kill them? The thing I hate the most is backstabbers like you, bullying the weak with your strength. If you do not wish for your son to be murdered when he goes out, then you should stop doing things like this.\u201d\u201cAnd as for the Tang Clan,\u201d Xiao Chen shifted his gaze to Tang Tian, \u201cStop playing such tricks. If you are not afraid that I will end your family line, I would not mind giving you a helping hand.\u201d\u201cHow intolerable! Xiao Chen, are you intending to start a war between our clans before the Promise of Ten Years? To think that you are considering ending my family line!\u201d Tang Tian\u2019s face turned purple, and the people behind him also surrounded them, glaring like a tiger watching its prey.[TL notes: glaring like a tiger watching its prey is a chinese idiom meaning eyeing covetously]The silent Xiao Qiang suddenly opened his mouth to speak, \u201cIf it\u2019s a war you want, then war it is. My Xiao Clan is just afraid that you are not up to par. Give it your all and use whatever moves you have. My Xiao Clan will take you head on. Although my Xiao Clan is not strong, we would not be like some people who formed an alliance behind other\u2019s backs and play tricks.\u201d\u201cEven before the Trial started, you sent two elders from your own families to ambush us at the Xiao Clan campsite. It\u2019s a pity that the Will of Heaven transcends those of man, causing your people to be killed instead.\u201dDugu Feng\u2019s expressions changed, \u201cThere is such a thing going on?\u201dTang Tian thought very quickly, this matter was not a glorious one and had resulted in him going against the agreement with the City Lord. Thus, he could not admit to it, \u201cXiao Qiang, don\u2019t accuse someone else blindly. If you want to accuse someone, you have to bring out evidence first.\u201d\u201cEvidence? The bodies of the elders from your two clans were already buried by us long ago. If you want evidence, I can go and dig them up now. I would like for you to explain what the elders of your two clans are doing at the Xiao Clan campsite before the Trial started.\u201dTang Tian and the Zhang Clan head were shocked; they did not expect that these four people were dead already, and that their bodies were found by the Xiao Clan\u2019s people. This was making it difficult for them to explain themselves.Dugu Feng spoke up in an attempt to resolve the situation, \u201cElder Xiao, since no one from the Xiao Clan got injured, how about we temporarily let this go? The Xiao Clan obtained a great harvest this Trial. I will definitely report this to the higher ups when I get back.\u201dAs the City Lord of Mohe City, the thing that Dugu Feng did not want to see most was a war between the three clans. That would cause a great deal of death and damage. When his superior investigated it, it would not be easy for him to stay out of trouble.Xiao Qiang also did not wish to break out in war now. The situation now was clear; the Zhang Clan and Tang Clan had formed an alliance, and there was a strong power behind them backing them up. The current situation was not good for the Xiao Clan.If a war broke out, the Xiao Clan would definitely suffer great losses. All they could do now was stake everything on the duels of the Promise of Ten Years.Dugu Feng already guessed what Xiao Qiang was thinking of when he saw that Xiao Qiang did not say anything. He cast his gaze on the clan heads of the other two clans, \u201cI do not wish to see such things happen again in the future. It is fine to have some competition but do not raise it to the level of life and death.\u201dDespite Tang Tian and the Zhang Clan Head being in the wrong, the City Lord was willing to give them a way out of this embarrassing situation. He had also conveniently said some things out of formality.\u201cThe Trial has ended, everyone need not be concerned with the matters that occurred here. You may all return,\u201d Dugu Feng said finally.\u2026The results of the Trial was spread to the entire Mohe City the next day, that the Xiao Clan obtained first place again. However, it was unknown how, and that the process of the Trial was spread by someone.The matter of Xiao Chen abruptly taking out 20-odd Rank 3 Demonic Core in front of the Zhang Clan and Tang Clan was spread everywhere; it became the talk of town.Xiao Chen\u2019s victory over Zhang He also became the topic of discussion amongst all the people. Everyone believed that with Xiao Chen, the Xiao Clan would not have to worry about the Promise of Ten Years occurring about a month later.Mohe City, Xiao Clan:After the trial ended, the First Elder strictly ordered for Xiao Chen and the other cultivators preparing for the Promise of Ten Years to stay at home and not go out. At such a critical moment, if the candidates were injured it would be a bad thing for the Promise of Ten Years.Although the Zhang Clan and Tang Clan had promised not to play anymore tricks, they still could not let their guard down. If anything happened, as long as there was no proof, nothing could be done.Xiao Chen stood in the yard holding a small knife; he was not in a hurry to cultivate. He was carving something on the Spiritual Wood he had obtained from that Tree Spirit.The stone table was filled with some small sculptures that Xiao Chen carved. There were many different types: birds, beasts, humans; there were all sorts of sculptures. However, their quality varied; there were good ones and bad ones. For most of them, their form could not be made out.In the few days after he returned from Gloomy Forest, Xiao Chen felt that he had touched the boundaries of Martial Master. As long as he encountered an opportune moment, he could break through immediately.Thus, he did not focus all his time on cultivating. After all, those participating in the Promise of Ten Years were early Martial Masters, at best.Thus, it was not worthwhile for him to cultivate. He might as well use this time to look through the spells and talismans in the Compendium of Cultivation. After he came back, he purchased a large amount of wood and started to train his carving skills.After spending a week of time on this, he carved more than a thousand sculptures using these ordinary woods. Now, Xiao Chen finally began to attempt carving on the piece of Spiritual Wood. However, he only used a small segment of it.\u201cHu!\u201dXiao Chen gently placed this sculpture, that was about the size of his finger, on his hand. It was a swallow, a creature from his previous life. At this moment, although he had completed carving it and it looked very similar, Xiao Chen felt that it was missing a certain\u00a0grace.\u201cSecond Young Master, are you carving again? You sure are very idle. I just saw Miss Yulan and Xiao Jian dueling each other in the practice grounds. They are very anxious, and working very hard,\u201d Bao`er was carrying a large bag as she walked over.Xiao Chen smiled softly when he heard this. He picked up one of the sculptures on the stone table and said to Bao`er, \u201cThis is for you, does it look good?\u201dBao`er received it and took a look. She discovered that this sculpture was created in her image. Blushing a little, she felt some joy in her heart, \u201cSecond Young Master, how could you... you actually made a sculpture of me.\u201dShe placed the things she brought aside after she said that, picked up the sculpture, and ran off shyly. Xiao Chen watched the image of Bao`er\u2019s back disappear. Smiling gently, he looked at the things she brought, feeling very grateful in his heart.During these few days, Xiao Chen could not go out. Thus, whatever he wanted to buy, Bao`er had to go get them for him. Furthermore, he used a large amount of this stuff, so it was tough for the girl.Carrying the things Bao`er bought, Xiao Chen slowly headed towards his room. After he entered his room, Xiao Chen had a very carefree expression on his face.He picked up the swallow carved from the Spiritual Wood and held it in his hands. Concentrating very hard, he tapped it lightly, and the Spiritual Energy in the swallow\u2019s body suddenly became incredibly dense, giving off the radiance of life.\u201cPuda! Puda!\u201dThe swallow grew larger, to about the size of a regular bird, and flapped its wings. It actually came to life; there was a melodious cry, it was very refreshing.Success!Xiao Chen thought joyfully in his heart. This was a spell in the Compendium of Cultivation to turn objects into an army, the Life Bestowal Spell; it could turn lifeless objects into high grade creatures.However, as Xiao Chen\u2019s cultivation was currently low, he was not able to create an army just by scattering some beans. He had to first carve out the creature that he wanted to create. Furthermore, the material had to contain Spiritual Energy.[TL notes: \u6492\u8c46\u6210\u5175, cast beans on grounds which are transformed by magic into soldiers; work miracles]In the past few days, he had attempted to do so many times using the sculptures he carved from ordinary wood, but it had never succeeded. It was only until today, when he used the sculpture made of Spiritual Wood, that he was able to succeed in using this spell.Xiao Chen stretched his hands into the air, and the swallow felt the intentions of Xiao Chen. It flapped its wings and flew onto his hand. Xiao Chen smiled softly, and carefully caressed the creature he had created.Xiao Chen retrieved his gaze, and turned his attention to the things that Bao`er bought. He took them out, one by one, and placed them on the table; a brush, a large bottle of Spirit Beast Blood, and a stack of yellow paper.The yellow paper was not ordinary paper; it was made from the skin and bones of Spirit Beasts, and they were very expensive. When Xiao Chen found out that such paper was available for sale in this world, he was was very excited for the entire day.This paper was very suitable for making talismans. However, the people of this world only knew of its property for not rotting and only used it for writing important documents or books. It was a waste of such good material.Talismans were an important method of attacking amongst the immortal spells. In the past, Xiao Chen\u2019s cultivation was insufficient and he did not have time to work on it, so he had not researched it.Before the great battle occurred, Xiao Chen actually had a lot of free time. Thus, if he did not spend some time researching this, it would be a pity.Xiao Chen poured the Spirit Beast Blood into the ink bottle, then he took out a Rank 3 Demonic Core and crushed it into powder before placing it in the ink bottle.The Spirit Beast Blood in the bottle immediately boiled over, and there was a grey color Qi on its surface. The red blood turned into a deep purple.Xiao Chen felt some satisfaction when he saw that the Spiritual Energy in the blood increased many times over when he added the Demonic Core.Picking up the brush, he dabbed it into the purple fluid. Xiao Chen began to draw talismans. With just a thought, the surrounding Spiritual Energy started to slowly head towards the tip of the brush.With every movement Xiao Chen made, talisman scripts appeared on the yellow paper. The places where the purple liquid passed gave off a faint glow.When Xiao Chen finished the final stroke, the glow on the paper erupted out. Streams of radiance followed the strange talisman scripts and created a small formation.Xiao Chen put aside the brush and quickly formed a seal with both of his hands. The glow on the yellow paper died down. After Xiao Chen made the hand seal, the paper rapidly folded itself, turning into a triangular shape as Xiao Chen grasped it in his hands.Xiao Chen breathed out in relief. This talisman could be said to be made in one breath, without any mistakes. Although it was only the most elementary attacking type talisman, Xiao Chen was already satisfied with being able to succeed on the first attempt.\u201cPuchi!\u201dXiao Chen tossed out the talisman in his hand; the triangular talisman opened up in midair, then exploded with a \u2018bang\u2019, creating a palm sized fireball.The swallow happily flying in the air was startled, and it dropped down with a \u2018pu tong\u2019 sound. It turned back into a wooden sculpture, and there was no more Spiritual Energy in the Spiritual Wood.Seeing all these things, Xiao Chen could not help but smile bitterly. He had used good materials and a high grade method, but because the talisman\u2019s grade was too low,\u00a0with it\u2019s small might, it would even be difficult to kill a mosquito.What caused him to be completely speechless was what happened to the swallow that he created, despite the easily ignorable nature of such an attack.I have to continue to work hard, make higher grade talismans, and stronger sculptures, Xiao Chen encouraged himself in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 74: Heavenly Qin SchoolHalf a month went by in a flash, and the date of the Promise of Ten Years was drawing nearer. Xiao Chen holed himself up in his house, researching the talisman and Life Bestowal Spell. He spent the time in isolation, choosing not to leave his home for the duration.\u201cHu!\u201dXiao Chen followed the methods listed on the Compendium of Cultivation, and injected Spiritual Energy into the wooden sculpture. With a \u2018shua\u2019 sound, the wooden sculpture turned into a woman radiating golden light, and hovering in midair.The woman wielded a long golden spear. She waved it gently in midair and a stream of Dragon Qi gathered in the spear. Nine golden dragon shadows appeared behind her back, giving off the might of the dragon into the surroundings.\u201cBoom!\u201dBefore Xiao Chen\u2019s smile could fade away the woman shattered, turning into a pile of ash, and scattering slowly into the air.It\u2019s still a failure, Xiao Chen sighed in his heart. His advancement in talismans was great, but he was still unable to succeed completely in the Life Bestowal Spell.It was no longer difficult for Xiao Chen to carve some small animals and let them come to life temporarily. However, he was still unsuccessful at creating real soldiers and weapons.This woman was carved in the image of Yue Ying. Yue Ying was the strongest women he had ever met. Furthermore, Xiao Chen\u2019s Battle Sage Origins\u2019 Changing Character Formula managed to capture a trace of the martial techniques that she used. Thus, it could be successfully merged within.Nevertheless, during this past half a month of efforts, Xiao Chen kept feeling that he was missing a certain important grace. The lifeforms that he created for battle were not able to last more than three seconds.Could it be that he could only succeed after he became a Martial Master?\u00a0Xiao Chen thought with doubts in his heart. Only half a meter remained of the originally one meter long Spiritual Wood piece. The chances that Xiao Chen had left were limited.It was difficult to find wood with a spiritual nature like this so Xiao Chen had Bao`er ask around in Linlang Pavilion, even in the Qizi County branch, to acquire more. It was rare to find even a single piece of wood like this in a year.Those Spiritual Wood that were of a certain age were even more difficult to find. Even if this kind of Spiritual Wood was in stock, it would seem Xiao Chen was unable to obtain it due to this kind of Spiritual Wood being in high demand. The moment one was available, it was purchased by alchemists at high prices.Although Xiao Chen was quite anxious, he did not worry about it too much. He could not rush these things. With regards to matters of comprehension or spirituality, the more one was in a hurry, the less likely one would find that kind of feeling.Returning to the table, Xiao Chen\u2019s vaguely depressed mood improved slightly. Scattered around the table were the talismans he had created over the past few days.The talismans listed in the Compendium of Cultivation were complicated, and had many different types. These various types of talismans could cause one to have a headache; it was truly too much for his eyes to take in. To make it easy for him to organize them, Xiao Chen split them into three categories: attack type, defense type, special type.The attack type talismans mainly used Spiritual Energy of different attributes. The more complicated the talisman scripts were, the more attributes the talisman had, and its attack would be stronger as well.As for the defense type and special type talismans, in theory they functioned similarly to the attack type talismans, only they were used in slightly different ways.Talismans could be divided into nine grades; with Xiao Chen\u2019s current strength he was currently only able to sculpt Grade 2 talismans. It was possible for him to sculpt Grade 3 talismans, but the failure rate was very high.After trying for a few times, Xiao Chen stopped attempting it. It wasted too many materials, and the gains did not make up for the losses he incurred.\u201cSecond Young Master, the First Elder asked you to go to the great hall. He said that there is an important guest here,\u201d Bao`er\u2019s melodious voice rang from outside the door.Xiao Chen opened the door and came out. He said with some doubts, \u201cImportant guest? Bao`er, do you know who it is?\u201dBao`er smiled mischievously, \u201cIt\u2019s a beauty; a very pretty one. The First Elder was very respectful to her, addressing her as Miss Feng.\u201d\u201cMiss Feng? Feng Feixue?\u201dXiao Chen\u2019s eyes brightened, \u201cIs the girl wearing men\u2019s clothes?\u201dBao`er replied strangely, \u201cSecond Young Master, how did you know?\u201d\u201cCan I not predict it?\u201d Xiao Chen smiled gently.That should be right,\u00a0Xiao Chen thought in his heart, it definitely is Feng Feixue.\u00a0How strange, what is she doing at our Xiao Clan at this time?It was only half a month away from the Promise of Ten Years; was this just a coincidence?After walking past a few gardens, Xiao Chen quickly arrived at the great hall. What caused Xiao Chen surprise was that aside from Xiao Qiang and Feng Feixue, Xiao Jian nd Xiao Yulan were present as well.\u201cYoung Master Xiao, it\u2019s been a long time,\u201d Feng Feixue was dressed in male attire, exuding a sense of heroism; she still looked as graceful as before.Xiao Chen smiled gently, \u201cI never expected to meet you here. Running into you everywhere, Miss Feng truly possesses remarkable abilities.\u201dWhen the three people at the side saw that Xiao Chen knew Feng Feixue, they were astonished. Xiao Qiang asked, \u201cXiao Chen, you know Miss Feng already?\u201dXiao Yulan and Xiao Jian were curious about Xiao Chen\u2019s answer to Xiao Qiang\u2019s question.Xiao Chen found a chair and sat beside Xiao Yulan, \u201cCan\u2019t really say I know her. We have met a few times. Would First Elder please introduce us properly?\u201dXiao Qiang smiled when he heard this, \u201cThis is Miss Feng Feixue. The merchant\u2019s association run by her clan is the largest in the Great Qin Nation. Their business is spread throughout the entire continent. Even in the Great Jin Nation, they are amongst the top.\u201d\u201cTheir ancestors and our Xiao Clan had some sort of relationship,\u201d there was a faint sad expression in his eyes as Xiao Qiang said this.Feng Feixue keenly noticed the faint sadness in Xiao Qiang\u2019s eyes. She smiled indifferently, appearing to be very calm, \u201cUncle Xiao speaks too highly... We are merely businessmen.\u201dAlthough she said it in a modest manner, the way she said it showed that she had accepted Xiao Qiang\u2019s words. Xiao Chen and the other two were astonished. The Tianwu Continent was so big, and yet her clan was able to spread their business throughout it The amount of strength needed to accomplish this could not be underestimated.However, with such great power, how could it be that they had a relationship with the Xiao Clan\u2019s ancestors? Even if they did used to have a relationship with the Xiao Clan\u2019s ancestor, there was no need to pay the Xiao Clan a visit now.Xiao Qiang looked at the three of them and said, \u201cSince the three of you are here, I shall tell you the purpose of Miss Feng\u2019s visit. After the Promise of Ten Years is over, regardless of the results, Miss Feng intends to think of a way to recommend all of you to the Heavenly Qin School.\u201dHeavenly Qin School... When the three of them heard these words, their hearts were in turmoil and they were unable to calm down for a long time.Heavenly Qin School was one of the five great schools of the Tianwu Continent. It was situated in the capital of the Great Qin nation. Actually, it had existed for even longer than the Great Qin Nation.According to legend, the\u00a0Founding Emperor\u00a0of the Great Qin Nation, Ying Zheng, studied at the Heavenly Qin School when he was young. After he founded the nation, he immediately declared the Heavenly Qin School to be the National Institution.Aside from the three Holy Lands in the Tianwu Continent, there were a few other powers that had existed before the Tianwu Dynasty. Some of them were even older than the Holy Lands.These powers had been passed down since the Tianwu Dynasty. In the hearts of people, there was not much difference from the Hole Lands. Such examples of these powers in the Great Qin Nation were the Misty Sword Sect, Heavenly Saber Pavilion, and the Night Spirit Palace.The Heavenly Qin School was an existence that sat in between these two types of powers. It was stronger than those\u00a0false Holy Lands, but was weaker than the three Holy Lands. However, there was a fundamental difference from those sects. The school would not interfere with the power struggles between the sects; it was simply a school for studying.Even when there were internal conflicts in the imperial family, the extremely strong ancient seniors of the school did not lend a helping hand.Xiao Jian suppressed the excitement in his heart and asked, \u201cWith our talents, can we really join the Heavenly Qin School?\u201dFeng Feixue smiled indifferently, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this. The entrance exam of the school is not purely based on cultivation levels. The most important thing is combat abilities. Furthermore, with your current cultivations, your talents cannot be considered poor within the nation.\u201cThe most important thing is that some large clans have a few spots reserved for them. You don\u2019t have to worry at all.\u201dXiao Jian was not stupid, he quickly understood what she meant. He asked bluntly, \u201cThese spots should be very precious. Do you have any demands of us by giving them to us? I don\u2019t believe that you would be so generous.\u201dFeng Feixue could not help but smile when she heard this, \u201cFirst Young Master is very direct, but I truly do not have any demands. If you do not believe it, you can ask Uncle Xiao.\u201dThe three of them turned their gazes to Xiao Qiang to see what eh would say. For there to be no demands, it was truly unbelievable.Xiao Qiang nodded his head, \u201cIf you have any concerns, just speak your mind. If you do not wish to go, Miss Feng will not force you.\u201d\u201cXiao Jian gives many thanks to Miss Feng\u2019s kind intentions. I truly wish to go, please forgive my earlier words.\u201d[TL notes: In ancient chinese culture, sometimes when one is being very respectful, they might refer to themselves in the third person. It's more of a formal way of saying things.]\u201cI wish to know how wide the heavens are, and how many talented geniuses there are on this earth. If I stay in Mohe City forever, I will definitely come to regret it,\u201d there was a trace of a heroic spirit and sincerity in Xiao Jian\u2019s tone.Xiao Yulan looked at Xiao Chen. Her eyes were twinkling with hope,\u00a0\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, are you going?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see when father comes out from his isolation,\u201d Xiao Chen said, somewhat evading the question.Although Xiao Chen was looking forward to joining the Heavenly Qin School, he did not long for it as much as Xiao Jian. As for how wide the heavens were and how many talented genius there were... Could these answers be found in the Heavenly Qin School?When one\u2019s eyes are obscured by a leaf, one is unable to see Mount Tai. The sky that you see may be only a leaf in the eyes of others.[TL notes: When one\u2019s eyes are obscured by a leaf, one is unable to see Mount Tai... this means that they are unable to see the wider picture.]Xiao Chen had already made up his mind long ago to leave the Xiao Clan after the Promise of Ten Years. As to where he would go, he had not yet decided. After the matter with Ao Jiao, the Lunar Shadow Saber had not rang out for him again. The place he really wanted to go was still the Heavenly Saber Pavilion.Thinking of Ao Jiao, the depressing feelings that Xiao Chen kept suppressed erupted out, causing him to feel a sense of loss.Xiao Jian could not help but be surprised when he heard Xiao Chen\u2019s words. He could not help but cast his gaze on the First Elder. Xiao Qiang smiled gently, \u201cNo matter. After the Clan Head comes out from isolation, he would respect your decisions. He would absolutely not stop you.\u201dXiao Yulan could not help but feel some disappointment when she noticed the lack of the desire to go in Xiao Chen\u2019s words. She said sadly, \u201cMiss Feng, can I consider this for awhile first?\u201dSeeing Xiao Yulan\u2019s expression, a strange glow flashed in Feng Feixue\u2019s eyes but it disappeared very quickly. Feng Feixue smiled and said, \u201cI will not be leaving for a month; you can take your time and consider carefully.\u201dShe then turned her gaze to Xiao Chen, \u201cYoung Master Xiao, may I have a word with you?\u201dXiao Chen looked towards the First Elder. After seeing him nod, he replied, \u201cSure, no problem.\u201dThe two of them walked out of the great hall, and\u00a0Feng Feixue\u00a0was leading the way in front. They stopped when they arrived at the desolated garden. Turning around, a pair of bright eyes stared at Xiao Chen.Feeling a little unnatural, Xiao Chen said, \u201cI wonder what does Miss Feng wants to speak to me about.\u201d\u201cPu Ci!\u201dFeng Feixue did not respond to him. Instead, a folding fan appeared in her hands and was shoved in front of Xiao Chen\u2019s face. The folding fan gave off a fiery-red glow; as it approached Xiao Chen, it opened up with a \u2018shua\u2019 sound.A fiery-red lotus flower soared high into the air. It was very alluring, and pretty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 75: Rushing Thunder Saber TechniqueFacing Feng Feixue\u2019s sudden attack, Xiao Chen felt flabbergasted in his heart. However, he was not overly panicked. Feng Feixue\u2019s attack was incredibly sharp, but he could not detect a trace of killing intent.\u201cRushing Thunder Chop!\u201dFacing the fiery-red lotus in front of him, with just a thought, the Lunar Shadow Saber appeared in his hands and instantly executed the Rushing Thunder Chop. The black saber light was like rushing thunder, as it chopped toward the red lotus.\u201cBang!\u201dThe lotus flower scattered turning into countless red sparks. Under the bright sun, it was like a butterfly dancing around.Seeing Xiao Chen execute the Rushing Thunder Chop, a gleam appeared in Feng Feixue\u2019s eyes. Following that, with a wave of her hands, the folding fan changed out for a slender long saber.Feng Feixue grasped the long saber in her hand and her feet shifted slightly as she took up a stance. Her aura changed suddenly, and there was harmony between her and the saber; only herself and the saber existed.Feng Feixue shouted lightly, \u201cDraw!\u201dA saber light flashed, like a laser show; it was fast and graceful. In an instant the saber light reached the surprised Xiao Chen. Regardless of the speed or the force behind this saber, it all had reached the pinnacle of Martial Master.Xiao Chen\u2019s brain moved as fast as lightning. When he saw Feng Feixue take up that stance, he immediately thought of the strike that Ao Jiao used when they went to forge his weapon.Although Feng Feixue did not achieve the same level of aura as Ao Jiao did back then, she had pretty much achieved a good portion of its grace. Xiao Chen did not dare to be careless, and quickly retreated.However, this saber was too fast. Even though Xiao Chen had retreated in advance, the wind caused by the saber light nimbly cut Xiao Chen\u2019s forehead, leaving behind a small wound; fresh blood flowed out.What a fast saber,\u00a0Xiao Chen thought in his heart as he took a breath of cold air. However, with Feng Feixue\u2019s second saber strike already coming, he did not have time to let out even a sigh.\u201cArclight Chop!\u201dFeng Feixue gently twisted her hands and pointed the tip of the saber downwards. An azure arc of light appeared; this was the arclight caused by the pure saber light.Everywhere the arclight passed in the garden, flowers flew around and petals scattered everywhere, flying without the wind blowing.With the settling of countless of fresh flowers, Feng Feixue\u2019s graceful temperament was currently like that of a fairy from the heavenly palace, pure and without a speck of impurity.However, Xiao Chen did not have the time to enjoy this hard to come by view; he had to retreat. The angle of this attack had sealed off all paths of attack, leaving him with no other choice but to retreat.\u201cRushing Heaven Chop!\u201dFeng Feixue shouted gently and her feet softly pushed off the ground. She turned into a streak of light, rushing towards Xiao Chen with her saber pointing at his head. The aura of this saber pressed forward, as though it was hastening toward the heavens, seeming very graceful.What a strong aura, Xiao Chen exclaimed in his heart. This surging saber was not fancy at all; it went directly for his head, forcing Xiao Chen to clash with it. However, Xiao Chen had already retreated by two steps, and his aura was also diminished significantly, causing him to lose his opportunity.Furthermore, this saber had almost reached the level of being one with the saber. Xiao Chen could not find any weak points, and did not know how to deal with it or how to block this soaring saber.Retreat; he could only continue to retreat.However, Feng Feixue was rocketing forward. If he continued to retreat backwards and his body rose into the air, just by a little bit, he would naturally run into her saber blade.Xiao Chen felt incredibly sullen. He could only roll backwards in a sorry state, avoiding the surging saber strike. This was the most direct method, and the most effective method, but it was also the method that made him look pathetic.\u201cRushing Thunder Chop!\u201dFeng Feixue twisted her perfect body in the air, and it rose higher into the sky. There was a sudden clap of thunder that crackled behind her, and she seized the opportunity to descend downwards, bringing with her the might of the wind and thunder.At this moment, Xiao Chen, who was crouching on the ground, did not have enough time to get up. Seeing Feng Feixue sending a saber strike at him containing the might of wind and thunder, Xiao Chen felt incredibly terrified.Is this the true Rushing Thunder Chop? Xiao Chen thought in his heart. From the moment the saber was drawn, its aura was rising unceasingly while the opponent was forced to continually retreat.When the opponent\u2019s aura reached rock bottom, its aura would be raised to its peak. Using a sure kill strike at this moment, filled with surging thunder; it was unblockable.Just then, Xiao Chen could not waste time considering this; he had no way to avoid this saber. As long as he retreated just by a step, he would be chopped into halves. He could only passively block. When his aura was at its weakest, he had to block the saber, whose aura would be at its peak.What a great saber technique!\u00a0Although the situation was urgent, Xiao Chen could not help but praise it in his heart.\u201cPu Ci!\u201dXiao Chen stood up bravely and raised his Lunar Shadow Saber. An electrical glow shone in all directions, and the Rank 6 Demonic Core released its boundless might without holding back. He had to raise his aura up as much as he could in the shortest time possible.\u201cBang!\u201dFeng Feixue\u2019s saber, which was filled with the might of rushing thunder, ruthlessly hacked on Xiao Chen\u2019s Lunar Shadow Saber. A resplendent electrical light blasted the blade of the two sabers apart.\u201cPutong!\u201dHuge force traveled down from the blade of the saber, instantly transmitting it to both of their arms, and then their legs. Xiao Chen staggered and retreated backward by two steps.\u201cRushing Thunder Second Chain Chop!\u201dFeng Feixue landed on the ground and shouted loudly. Both of her hands were grasping the saber as she stepped forward, chopping horizontally at Xiao Chen. This saber had a supreme aura to it, which was originally already raised to its peak, and continued to rise even further, finally reaching a shocking level.\u201cBang!\u201dAll of a sudden, Xiao Chen\u2019s defenses were unable to withstand this saber and he was knocked into the air.His body continued to fly backwards as Xiao Chen did his best to turn himself around, barely managing to land on the ground stably.The blood and Qi in his body were surging, and his internal organs all seemed to be shakened. However, Xiao Chen knew that this saber strike did not contain all of Feng Feixue\u2019s capabilities. Otherwise, he would not have been able to block it.Feng Feixue wielded the sword as she stood up straight. She said in a somewhat apologetic manner, \u201cYoung Master Xiao, I have offended you. There is a complete record of this Rushing Thunder Saber Technique at the Heavenly Qin School.\u201d\u201cAs long as you decided to go to the Heavenly Qin School, there are plenty of such techniques scattered around. There, you would gain tremendous benefits.\u201dXiao Chen smiled bitterly to himself. After fighting for so long, she was actually attempting to convince him to join the Heavenly Qin School,\u00a0Feng Feixue, you are interesting.After listening to Feng Feixue\u2019s explaination, the anger in Xiao Chen\u2019s heart now disappeared.Xiao Chen also knew that Feng Feixue had held herself back from the very first strike. Furthermore, she had not revealed any killing intent throughout the entire battle. It can only be said that she was sincere. This kind of straightforward method was also to Xiao Chen\u2019s liking. It's a pity that Xiao Chen truly could not go.Xiao Chen stood up. After he was stable, he suddenly drew his saber. It was the same stance that Feng Feixue had used earlier. Feng Feixue revealed an expression of shock, as this move was not much slower than hers.Throwing aside the saber in her hands, the folding fan appeared in her hands once more. A fiery-red lotus flower appeared at her feet. Within moments, it spread to an area of ten meters around her; everywhere her feet landed, red lotus flowers would blossom.\u201cYoung Master Xiao, \u2026\u201dFeng Feixue was about to say something after she stood up straight, but Xiao Chen did not give her this opportunity. He instantly used the Lightning Evasion and appeared in front of her. Seizing a good opportunity, he used the Arclight Chop; a long arc of light appeared in the air.Feng Feixue was different from Xiao Chen; she had been practising the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique for a period of time already, and understood the essence of this saber technique very well. She knew that she could not retreat. Once she started, she would not be able to stop, finally resulting in her aura reaching rock bottom.She turned her body to the side gently and sent the folding fan forwards, meeting the Lunar Shadow Saber in Xiao Chen\u2019s hands.\u201cBoom!\u201dHowever, Feng Feixue was shocked by the huge force that came from the saber blade. She had always thought that Xiao Chen was only a Peak Martial Disciple. Thus, she had controlled her Essence to remain at the level of an early Martial Master, in case she injured Xiao Chen accidently.However, she did not expect that Xiao Chen\u2019s strength was greater than a regular peak Martial Disciple. Stepping on the red lotus flower under her feet, Feng Feixue retreated backward by quite a few steps.\u201cRushing Heaven Chop!\u201dXiao Chen did not wait for her to stabilize herself before rushing over, pointing the saber tip towards her head. This move that put Xiao Chen in a such sorry state earlier was not working on Feng Feixue.What caused Xiao Chen to be mildly disappointed was that even though Feng Feixue was retreating, she was doing so in a much more relaxed manner than Xiao Chen did. As the lotus flowers blossomed, the air was filled with a radiance, following Feng Feixue as she retreated by three steps.\u201cRushing Thunder Chop!\u201dXiao Chen shouted out in midair, and a clap of thunder crackled behind him. The might of thunder and wind followed him as he moved. This move was something that Xiao Chen had used many times, only executed in a different manner. Xiao Chen could clearly feel the difference between the two.Release!\u00a0Feng Feixue shouted lightly in her heart. Two fiery-red lotus flowers appeared in her eyes. The folding fan that was originally giving off a faint glow in her hands turned complete dull, looking like it was completely ordinary, and its brilliance was reserved.She swung it up lightly, catching onto Xiao Chen\u2019s saber as it descended from the sky. There was no heaven shaking sound or any Qi waves that would result from a collision. It just smoothly blocked Xiao Chen\u2019s thunderous saber.She managed to scatter away the aura that had built up to its peak. This was similar to someone having cold water poured on him as he was about to climax.Xiao Chen landed on the ground feeling incomparably depressed. He did not even have the opportunity to use the Rushing Thunder Second Chain Chop. The taste of being beaten up by someone like this was unbearable.The red lotus flowers in her eyes faded away and Feng Feixue smiled mildly, \u201cHow is it? you have experienced the might of the complete technique for yourself. It is not something an incomplete technique can compare to, right?. The Heavenly Qin School still has many more Martial Techniques like this. With the talent you displayed here, your cultivation is sure to advance by leaps and bounds.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, this set of Rushing Thunder Saber Technique still has a Rushing Thunder Third Chain Chop. Even I\u2019m not able to use it. After you go there, you would be able to learn it immediately.\u201dXiao Chen recovered his calm and sincerely felt that it was funny. This Feng Feixue was like a wolf grandmother, continually enticing him.[TL notes: I have to admit, I was very surprised at the use of this term \u2018Wolf Grandmother\u2019 and had to look it up. Apparently it is referring to the wolf in Red Riding Hood, where it pretended to be the grandmother and kept trying to get little Red Riding Hood to come nearer so it could eat her.]Based on his instincts, he was sure that Feng Feixue did not have any bad intentions. It was a pity that, although Feng Feixue\u2019s cultivation was high, she was not able to hear the sound of the saber.Xiao Chen walked to the side and picked up the saber Feng Feixue threw aside, \u201cMiss Feng, can you hear its voice?\u201dFeng Feixue was stunned for a while, and was slightly confused before she said, \u201cYou are talking about listening to the sword, and communicating with it? I am not able to do it.\u201dThe ability to create a resonance with weapons had nothing to do with cultivation, and relied entirely on one\u2019s comprehension.Many of the ancient leveled seniors of the Heavenly Qin School were not even able to comprehend that level. It was natural for her to not be able to hear the sound of the saber, as that was not her primary weapon.Xiao Chen cupped his hands in thanks, \u201cI sincerely thank Miss Feng for the recommendation. However, I, Xiao Chen, am only looking for a place where I can hear the sound of the saber. I already have my own plans; I can only accept your kind intentions.\u201dXiao Chen turned around and left after he said that. Feng Feixue looked at the image of his back as he left, frowning slightly. Thinking in her heart,\u00a0If he is not going to the Imperial Capital, then this is going to be difficult. With this course, there would be no way to guarantee his safety.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 76:\u00a0Advancing to Martial MasterXiao Chen walked quickly to his courtyard. He had comprehended some things during the earlier battle. The Essence in his body was continually flowing throughout, and this was a sign that he was about to make a breakthrough.After using the Low Grade Spirit Stone, his cultivation had already reached the peak of Superior Grade Martial Disciple. Furthermore, during the Trial in Gloomy Forest, he had further solidified his cultivation as a Superior Grade Martial Disciple.After he came back, he felt that he was already one step into the Martial Master realm. All he had to do was to wait for an opportune moment, and he would be able to immediately make a breakthrough.Once inside his room, he sat cross-legged and entered into a state of cultivation. Sinking his consciousness down he saw the white clouds, which had increased to eight when he became a Superior Grade Martial Disciple, around the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit. At this moment they were glistening, and their luster was very bright. It was as though they were about to explode.Indeed, he was about to make a breakthrough. Xiao Chen felt happiness in his heart. Although he had guessed long ago that he would break through to Martial Master before the Promise of Ten Years, he would only feel truly assured when he actually broke into the Martial Master realm.The Purple Thunder Divine Incantation circulated rapidly in his body. Xiao Chen\u2019s heart was as calm as water. While Xiao Chen was immersed in this wondrous state, the surrounding Spiritual Energy streamed into his body continuously.His consciousness was controlling the racing Spiritual Energy in his body. Under the guidance of the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation, the Spiritual Energy circled around the meridians of the whole of his body before entering into the Dantian.The little Azure Dragon in the Dantian opened its mouth and sucked in this Spiritual Energy. There was a satisfied expression on its tiny dragon face. After a while, it spat out pure Essence from its mouth.Xiao Chen controlled this Essence, making it flow out slowly through his meridians, then he pervaded his bones and muscles with it, tempering his body.Aside from that time when he used the Spirit Stone, this was something that Xiao Chen would do every time he made a breakthrough. Due to the fact that he condensed his Martial Spirit quite late, he had used most of the Spiritual Energy he absorbed in the early stages to temper his body.This was an advantage that would be very useful in battle. Xiao Chen did not want to give up this advantage. If he continued on like this, it would only be a matter of time until he was able to reach the level of having tendons of bronze and bones of steel.The Purple Thunder Divine Incantation circulated nonstop in his body. After 49 cycles, Xiao Chen could sense that exploding feeling in his Dantian was becoming more and more intense.Taking a deep breath, he stopped circulating Spiritual Energy in the regular cycles and proceeded to circulate it in the great cycle, attempting to break through to the Martial Master realm.Under Xiao Chen\u2019s circulation, the Spiritual Energy in the room poured into his body like water. Xiao Chen absorbed Spiritual Energy like this for an hour before finally starting to circulate it.This Spiritual Energy, that was much stronger and denser than most regular Spiritual Energy, was slowly circulating in his body. Xiao Chen patiently and unhurriedly advanced forward bit by bit, following the order of acupoints along the meridians.Another hour went by, and the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation finally completed a great cycle. The turbulent, river-like Spiritual Energy rushed into the Dantian.The Azure Dragon opened its mouth excitedly, as though it was eating a delicacy, continually absorbing this large amount of Spiritual Energy. The white clouds surrounding it turned even brighter; it seemed like it would explode in the next moment.\u201cBooom!\u201dThere was an explosion of sound coming from near Xiao Chen\u2019s Martial Spirit after an unknown amount of time. The eight white clouds had erupted, and the area near his martial Spirit was in a state of chaos. However, Xiao Chen did not feel any discomfort. In fact, it was more like he had been suppressed to the extreme and had finally obtained release.This was a feeling that Xiao Chen had experienced before during his previous breakthrough. However, it did not feel as comfortable as it did now. The pores all over his body opened up and streams of black impurities flowed out.After half an hour, Xiao Chen controlled his consciousness and sank it down slowly to check out the area near his Martial Spirit. the originally chaotic area had become clear.When his consciousness arrived at his Dantian, it seemed like it had arrived at a whole new space. The white clouds of the past were gone, and there was now only a pool of clear water where his Martial Spirit used to reside. Even that tiny Azure Dragon had disappeared.What was going on? Where was the Azure dragon?\u00a0Xiao Chen was full of doubt as he thought in his heart.\u201cPu Tong!\u201dSuddenly, there was a splash coming from the pool. A lovable dragon head popped out from the small pond; it was swimming around happily in the crystal waters.When Xiao Chen\u2019s consciousness noticed the splash of water, he observed it carefully. After about 15 mins, Xiao Chen was full of joy.This pool of water was actually Xiao Chen\u2019s new method of storing Essence. When he had observed it earlier, just one droplet of the splash contained the same amount of Essence as ten percent of a white cloud.Xiao Chen calculated in his heart;\u00a0there should be about two handfuls of water in the pool in this space. If each drop of water contained the same amount of Essence as one tenth of a white cloud, there would be plenty of Essence available here.Regardless of refining medicine or battling with someone, he no longer had to worry about the consumption of his Essence anymore. Xiao Chen even had a rash impulse to try and see if he could execute the Return of the Azure Dragon.If he were able to, then in the Promise of Ten Years, he would be unrivaled. With the Heaven Ranked Martial Technique, even Martial Grand Masters would not be able to defend against it.Xiao Chen suddenly opened his eyes, and two beams of purple light shot out from them. Xiao Chen did not know what these purple beams of light meant. Every time he made a breakthrough, such a phenomena would occur in both his eyes.Shaking his head, Xiao Cheng did not bother to think about this any further. Seeing the disgusting black impurities on his entire body, he could not help but smile bitterly. Looks like every time he broke through a realm, he would have to change his clothes.Xiao Chen felt very uncomfortable covered in these sticky impurities. Thus, he quickly went to take a bath.After he was done with his bath and changed his clothes, Xiao Chen\u2019s entire body felt relaxed and alert. His face was radiating with health and vigor; he even felt that he was filled with an inexhaustible energy.\u201cSecond Young Master, where did you go to? I have been looking for you for a long time,\u201d when Bao`er saw him from outside the yard, she ran over hurriedly.Xiao Chen smiled, \u201cWhy are you looking for your Young Master? I went to take a bath earlier.\u201dBao`er checked out Xiao Chen with her eyes after she heard this, revealing a slightly expression that resembled drunkenness. She immediately blushed and said in a soft voice, \u201cSecond Young Master, you seem to have become even more good looking.\u201dCould it be that when I break into the Martial Master Realm, one\u2019s aura would change as well?\u00a0Xiao Chen thought with some doubts.However, there had never been any girls who had praised him like that. Xiao Chen smiled awkwardly, \u201cYou still have not told me why are you looking for me.\u201dBao`er woke up to reality and hurriedly said, \u201cMiss Feng asked me to hand this book to you before she left. She also asked me to pass on a message to you, \u2018If you change your mind in future, you can look for me any time.\u2019\u201dXiao Chen smiled bitterly in his heart; this girl had not given up on him yet. He received the book from Bao`er, and took a look. The expression on his face immediately changed slightly. This was actually the hand written copy of the complete manual for the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique.\u201cHow long has Miss Feng been gone?\u201d Xiao Chen asked as he put the book aside.Bao`er replied in a lovable manner, \u201cShe left about two hours ago, I believe.\u201d\u201cLooks like I cannot catch up to her\u2026\u201d Xiao Chen said with some regrets. Xiao Chen did not like receiving grace from another person for no reason at all.Looks like I will have to repay this debt of gratitude in the future, Xiao Chen muttered to himself as he looked at the hand written copy of the complete manual for the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique....After returning to his room, Xiao Chen stored the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique manual in his Universe Ring. He did not immediately take a look at it, as he still had something else he wanted to do.Xiao Chen took out the half meter long piece of wood and cut off a segment that was as large as his thumb. Then he began to carve it carefully. The Life Bestowal Spell was a very strong Immortal Spell. Although he had not succeeded in using it properly before, Xiao Chen had never thought about giving up either.Now that he was a Martial Master, the most urgent thing in Xiao Chen\u2019s heart was to continue attempting to succeed in this endeavor.He recalled every single detail of the battle between\u00a0Yue Ying\u00a0and Ye Chenzhou as he carved each nuance of Yue Ying\u2019s appearance, stroke by stroke.\u201cHu!\u201dBefore long, Xiao Chen had finished carving it and gently blew the wood shavings of the sculpture away. He picked it up and observed it carefully. The appearance of the wooden sculpture was almost exactly the same as what Xiao Chen remembered. However, he kept feeling that he was missing something.The wooden sculpture of the girl had a stern expression on her face. She was frowning slightly; she was not angry, but was radiating might. For a dead, inanimate object, it seemed to be radiating a stern might into the surroundings, just like a queen.Queen? Something clicked into place in Xiao Chen\u2019s mind. It was as though there was a cog in his mind that finally started to move. He seemed to have discovered something that he had not noticed in the past.\u201cRight. Queen! Why would Yue Ying be the queen?\u201d Xiao Chen suddenly said joyfully.He finally understood where he had gone wrong. He was too focused on how she looked when she was in battle... Just like a queen who ruled everything under the heavens. Thus, when he carved her, he had carved her in the image of a queen.However, Yue Ying was not a queen. The image of her looking very awkward when her stomach growled appeared in his mind. He remembered the moment she blushed when she called him a scoundrel.Now, this was a person made out of flesh and blood. As his cultivation was insufficient to perform the Life Bestowal Spell, he had to make up for it by making carvings. He had to carve out an image of Yue Ying that was true to life, or else, it would just be form without substance and it would not turn into a powerful weapon.Xiao Chen cut out another piece of Spiritual Wood, once more about the size of his thumb. His hands moved very fast as he carved out the image of the girl, thoroughly merging the image of her as she battled with her look when she was injured.Although it was easy to think of this, it was difficult to carry out. Xiao Chen carved then rejected his work endlessly. It was only when the half a meter long piece of wood was only left with a tiny segment that Xiao Chen managed to complete a piece of work with which he was satisfied.The absolute beauty was holding a golden spear, and her mighty and stern face had a faint smile on it. It did not have that earlier, threatening feel to it. Instead, there was the warmth of a girl.Of course, these were not the parts that Xiao Chen was the most satisfied with. The part that he liked most was that this absolute beauty was wearing only a red bra.\u201cI wonder if she would kill me on the spot if she saw this piece of work?\u201d Xiao Chen smiled to himself in a slightly ridiculing manner as he held the wooden sculpture in his hands. Maybe even she did not know that this was her true self.Casting away the idle thoughts, Xiao Chen focused and decided to use that Dragon Qi that Yue Ying had given to him to merge into the sculpture.If this still failed, then that Dragon Qi, which could save his life in a crucial moment, would be wasted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Dragon Qi travelled via the meridians and flowed out of his body, appearing on Xiao Chen\u2019s right hand.The energy contained in this Dragon Qi was very strong. This was the true Dragon Qi that had been passed down for thousands of years in the Great Qin Nation. Xiao Chen was surprised that Yue Ying was willing to give him a strand of it.If this Dragon Qi was completely used, even a Martial Saint would be severely injured. It was not an exaggeration for her to say that it would be able to protect Xiao Chen\u2019s life.\u201cHu!\u201dXiao Chen carefully infused the Dragon Qi into the wooden sculpture. A stream of golden light appeared at the feet of the wooden sculpture, and when the last bit of Dragon Qi was infused within, the entire wooden sculpture gave off a resplendent golden light.Xiao Chen took a deep breath. With a slight thought from him, the clear water around his Martial Spirit began to gradually surge up. A thick Essence flowed slowly to his right hand. He raised it and tapped on the forehead of the wooden sculpture with one finger.\u201cHu Chi!\u201dThe boundless Essence streamed into the wooden sculpture through that finger; it gave off a faint radiance. Xiao Chen\u2019s Essence was continually exhausted, as though incapable of being completely filled up. After 15 minutes, the clear water in his Dantian had already reduced by half.Xiao Chen was surprised in his heart,\u00a0To think that this Life Bestowal Spell would exhaust so much Essence. No wonder it was impossible to succeed before becoming a Martial Master.With the amount, purity, and strength of the Essence of a Martial Disciple, it was impossible to meet the requirements of this spell. Furthermore, the sculpture he made was not up to par. This naturally resulted in him failing.\u201cShua!\u201dWhen the amount of Essence in Xiao Chen\u2019s body was reduced to a quarter, the wooden sculpture suddenly turned large with a \u2018shua\u2019 sound. The Yue Ying that was only wearing a bra and holding a long spear came to life in front of Xiao Chen.She gently swung the golden spear in her hands, and nine golden dragon shadows appeared behind her back. With a \u2018boom\u2019, the dragon shadows flew all around in a chaotic manner before finally entering into her long spear.Xiao Chen was full of joy. With just a thought, Yue Ying turned into a beam of light and shot towards his hand, turning into a wooden sculpture once again.Success!\u201cAfter trying for countless times, I finally succeeded once. In the future, if I run into any Martial Saint expert, I will be able to hold my ground,\u201d Xiao Chen muttered joyfully to himself as he grasped the wooden sculpture tightly....It was less than half a month to the Promise of Ten Years. There were surging undercurrents within Mohe City.Mohe City, in a Secret Room of the Tang Clan:The Tang Clan Head, Zhang Clan Head, the mysterious old man in blue clothes, and a few consecrates of the two clans were there.The Zhang Clan Head\u2019s face was full of anxiety as he said, \u201cElder Leng, when can you pass the Returning Essence Pill to me? For the great undertaking of the Leng Clan, I have already risked everything. Now that my eldest son has been crippled, you must do something to help him.\u201dThe blue clothed Martial Saint smiled gently, \u201cElder Zhang, there is no need to be anxious. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to tell you how precious the Returning Essence Pill is, as it can help to recondense the Martial Spirit. Yesterday, I received news that my clan head has specially requested one from the Misty Sword Sect. It will probably arrive tonight.The Zhang Clan Head revealed an expression of joy as he said, \u201cIn that case, many thanks to Elder Leng. I am eternally grateful.\u201dThe blue clothed man waved his hands, \u201cThere is no need to stand on ceremony. We still need to rely on your son, as well as the son of the Tang Clan Head. Helping you is equivalent to helping myself.\u201dWhen Tang Tian, who was standing beside him, heard that the Zhang Clan head had managed to obtain a Returning Essence Pill, he felt some dissatisfaction in his heart and he said, \u201cElder Leng, my eldest son died at such a young age. Why do I not see you making compensation for that?\u201dThe expression on the blue clothed man\u2019s face changed slightly, \u201cElder Tang, it\u2019s not right that you say such a thing. With regards to the matter with the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox, I have held up my end of the bargain; I have done everything I should have. The one who killed your son was Xiao Chen.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, as far as I know, the talent of your eldest son is merely average. Normally, you wouldn't even care about him.\u201dTang Tian\u2019s face turned dark. The words of the blue clothed man were indeed true. He was not able to find any words or retort to that, and could only snort coldly without saying anything else.When the blue clothed man saw the situation, the expression on his face turned warmer, smiling, \u201cElder Tang, you don\u2019t have to be too anxious. After the Promise of Ten Years, when we obtain the Seven Horn Mountain, our Leng Clan will start up a new sect. By that time, the position of Supreme Elder will definitely be yours.\u201dWhen Tang Tian heard this, his expression became warmer, \u201cHowever, the three participants from the Xiao Clan are extremely strong. Not to mention the terrifying Xiao Chen, there is still Xiao Jian, and Xiao Yulan. The two of them are Martial Masters. I\u2019m afraid that even if Zhang He recovers his strength, we will still be unable to beat them.\u201dThe blue clothed\u00a0man smiled coldly, \u201cIs Xiao Chen very strong? I\u2019m not so sure. He was just lucky, and managed to kill one injured Martial Grand Master. He is not even a Martial Master, so how strong can he be?\u201d\u201cFurthermore, even if he is very strong, he would first require the opportunity to even attend the competition. Otherwise, no matter how strong he is, it will be useless.\u201dTang Tian and the Zhang Clan Head exchanged a look with each other, \u201cCould it be that Elder Leng is planning to take action personally, and cripple that fellow? However, doesn\u2019t the Xiao Clan have a Martial Saint expert as well?\u201dThe blue clothed man said indifferently, \u201cIn another two days, the Leng Clan Head will bring three Martial Saint elders to Mohe City personally. This Promise of Ten Years is something that was established by the Mohe City Lord. It is not appropriate to sabotage this in the open, but it is still possible to play some tricks behind their backs.\u201d\u201cAs for that Martial Saint from the Xiao Clan\u2026 Haha\u2026 He is just an Inferior Grade Martial Saint. My Clan Head could destroy him with just the wave of his hand.\u201dThe clan heads of the Zhang Clan and Tang Clan were both shocked in their hearts. This meant that, including the blue clothed man, all five Martial Saint experts of the Leng Clan would be coming. With their strength, they would be able to sweep away the Xiao Clan simply by relying on these five people....Now that Xiao Chen had succeeded at the Life Bestowal Spell, he focused his remaining time on consolidating his cultivation as an Inferior Grade Martial Master and drawing Talismans.A Martial Master had an abundant amount of Essence, so Xiao Chen attempted to create Grade 3 Talismans a few times and found that the success rates were higher than before. If his Purple Thunder Divine Incantation could advance to the third layer, then he could guarantee a 90% success rate.The days passed just like that, and in the blink of an eye, another week had passed.\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, are you there?\u201dXiao Chen was currently in his room drawing a Grade 3 dual attributed attack Talisman. He immediately put down what he was doing when he heard Xiao Yulan\u2019s voice.The instant Xiao Chen put down the brush, the Spiritual Energy in the Talisman completely faded away. Then it rose up into the air and burnt up, turning into ashes. This was normal for drawing talismans; if one was unable to finish it in a breath, then all the work put in was wasted.Xiao Chen felt that it was a pit in his heart. This was a Grade 3 Icefire Talisman, and it was just hair\u2019s breadth away from completion. If he was lucky, it could have succeeded.Xiao Chen was mildly surprised when he opened the doors. Aside from Xiao Yulan, there was also Xiao Jian, Xiao Ling`er, Ye Lan, and the other people from the Trial of Gloomy Forest with her.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why did you all come here?\u201d Xiao Chen said with some surprise.Xiao Ling`er had a big smile on her face as she said, \u201cElder Brother Xiao Chen, do you still not know? The First Elder gave us a one day holiday today, allowing all of us to go out. We all decided to take a walk around Mohe City, but we were missing you.\u201dXiao Chen suddenly understood something. This move of the First Elder was correct. After all, this was a bunch of young people. If they were locked up in the house, they would be stifled and something might go wrong.However, some suspicions appeared in his heart.\u00a0With so many people going out, what if something happened?Xiao Ling`er could tell that he was worrying about something. She raised her lily-white hands and pointed towards a certain direction, \u201cTake a look in that direction; there is a consecrate or something over there protecting us. We will be fine.\u201dXiao Chen looked in the direction she pointed and discovered that Liu Fengyin was standing outside the courtyard resting with his eyes closed. Behind him, there were also a few of the Xiao Clan\u2019s Martial Grand Masters following him.Xiao Chen laughed involuntarily in his heart. The First Elder was actually willing to send a big portion of the Xiao Clan\u2019s elite forces just for the group of them.\u201cLet\u2019s go then,\u201d Xiao Chen stopped hesitating and followed the group of them to Mohe City.In Mohe City, there were crowds moving around everywhere. It was as bustling as it had been in the past.The group of them followed the crowd and wandered around the streets, shopping everywhere. Xiao Chen suddenly discovered, regardless of the world, the girls all had a strong desire for shopping.Aside from Xiao Chen and Xiao Jian, out of the ten of them, the other males had bags of varied sizes hanging all over them. Ye Lan was the most miserable out of the lot; he was responsible for the things that Xiao Ling`er purchased. In every possible place where something could be hung, there was something hanging on him.\u201cLet\u2019s go to Cultivator's Plaza to take a look!\u201d Ye Lan finally could no longer take it, and made the suggestion in the hopes that it would distract Xiao Ling`er from shopping further.Cultivator's Plaza\u2026 Xiao Chen thought in his heart,\u00a0The Promise of Ten Years that was taking place seven days later would be held in Cultivator's Plaza. If they go there to check out the situation first, it would definitely be beneficial for them when the duels start.\u201cCousin Yulan, how about we go take a look? The duels are in seven days, and it might be good to check out the location in advance.\u201dXiao Yulan smiled faintly, \u201cWe will follow what Cousin Xiao Chen says.\u201dYe Lan and his other male brethren all looked at Xiao Yulan with gratitude and released their breath in relief. Only Xiao Ling`er seemed dissatisfied, as she was grumbling that she had not purchased enough things yet. When Ye Lan heard this, he felt very down, and he could not even muster up the mood to cry.Cultivator's Plaza was the center of Mohe City. In the center of the plaza, there was a hundred meters tall statue. This was a statue of the emperor of the Tianwu Dynasty from ten thousand years ago.Every city in the continent would have a Cultivator's Plaza; each of those Cultivator's Plazas would have a huge statue in the middle.\u00a0The likenesses of the people carved into the statues at each location\u00a0were basically all of the famous Martial Emperors of the past.Around the statue, there were 16 arenas made of Heavenly Mountain Stones. One of the arenas was particularly eye catching; its size and height were much larger than the surrounding ones.These arenas were all operated by the City Lord. This was a norm in the Tianwu Continent, and there would normally be plenty of people here. However, it currently was a prohibited zone, not allowing anyone to go in or out.Every year, there was a large scale competition that was held in Mohe City\u2019s Cultivator's Plaza. It was organized by the City Lord personally. Aside from winning generous prizes, one could also raise their reputation, and possibly be seen in a good light by the major Clans or the City Lord.This was the most bustling period in Mohe City. Furthermore, this competition coincided with the Promise of Ten Years of Mohe City\u2019s three major clans.\u00a0Imagining the\u00a0kind of bustling scene... It would be horrifyingly crowded.Thus, the City Lord\u2019s manor had sealed up the Cultivator's Plaza half a month ago and begun rehearsals, as well as conducting repairs in order to guarantee that nothing adverse would happen.However, this restriction was for the outsiders. For the Xiao Clan group, it was not a problem. All they had to do was report their identities, and the City Lord Manor\u2019s people would not stop them.The group walked towards the statue of the Tianwu Emperor in the center of the plaza. In front of the emperor of ten thousand years ago even the restless people in the crowd all quieted down.Just at this moment, Xiao Chen suddenly felt two gazes filled with killing intent staring at him. He turned his head and saw Tang Feng and Zhang He at an arena not far away, staring at him with a cold gaze. Apparently they were dueling with each other earlier.Zhang He was still actually able to use Martial Techniques?\u00a0Xiao Chen was sure that he did not see wrongly. The two of them were indeed dueling earlier, and Zhang He had even used a Martial technique.What\u2019s going on?\u00a0Xiao Chen\u2019s heart was filled with doubt. As he was thinking, Tang Feng and Zhang He jumped down from the arena and started to walk towards him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With the approach of the Promise of Ten Years, the three clans attached heavy importance to the protection of their participants.In front of the Tianwu Emperor\u2019s statue, under the bright sun, the people of the Xiao Clan were standing across from the people of the Zhang Clan and Tang Clan.\u201cXiao Chen, it\u2019s been a long time,\u201d Zhang He said slowly as he walked up to the front.When Xiao Jian first saw Zhang He, the flames of anger lit in both his eyes. He clenched his right fist tightly, and it gave off a cracking sound. When he thought of the scene from that day, his \u00a0heart suffered torment.Hearing Zhang He\u2019s voice, he could no longer restrain himself, \u201cZhang He, do you dare to have a duel with me?\u201dZhang He smiled coldly, \u201cWho do you think you are? I am talking to Xiao Chen, why are you interrupting me? Just a piece of trash... Do you think that you are still Mohe City\u2019s number one person?\u201dWhen Xiao Jian heard this he was startled, and angrily said, \u201cZhang He! Don\u2019t go overboard\u2026\u201dXiao Chen looked at Zhang He coldly as the Lunar Shadow Saber suddenly appeared in this hand. His feet shifted slightly, then his aura changed abruptly. There was harmony between himself and the saber; only he and the saber existed.\u201cDraw!\u201dThere was a flash of saber light as Xiao Chen suddenly made his move. Zhang He was startled; he had not expected that Xiao Chen would make a move against him in front of everyone without even saying a single word.He rapidly moved his body backwards. It was a pity that this saber was too fast. Furthermore, it was under the situation of a surprise attack.He utilized the movement technique, Heavenly Roc Spreading Wings, to its extreme. However, a bright red wound still appeared on his right arm, and blood instantly flowed out.The Zhang Clan and Tang Clan elders immediately rushed forward anxiously. However, when they saw Liu Fengyin standing silently behind, no one dared to take another step.The elders of the Xiao Clan also immediately rushed forward. In an instant, their bows were drawn and arrows ready. The atmosphere was extremely tense.Zhang He said angrily, \u201cXiao Chen, you actually dare to injure me in front of everyone!\u201dXiao Chen put aside his saber and stood up straight. Smiling indifferently he said, \u201cWith regards to the barking of dogs, I have always taken action instead of trying to reason with them. Could it be that if a dog bites me, then I should bite it back?\u201dThis insult did not contain any obscenities, but it managed to infuriate Zhang He completely. Xiao Jian instantly felt a significant relief of his anger.\u201cBrother Zhang, there is no need to get into a conflict with them here. They won\u2019t be able to continue bragging for long,\u201d Tang Feng, who was beside him, advised.Zhang He calmed himself down and thought about the things his father briefed him on that morning. Then he said to Xiao Chen, \u201cXiao Chen, I\u2019ll make you pay sooner or later. The humiliation of that day... I will return it\u00a0manifold.\u201dXiao Chen said nothing. Instead, the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation circulated rapidly in his body and his right hand suddenly pointed at Zhang He; a small thread of purple flames fired out.Due to the fact that Xiao Chen shot out this thread of flames in a hurry, he did not revolve it around his finger first before firing it; thus, the strength of the flames was not strong. The flames brushed by Zhang He\u2019s head before dissipating. All this happened in an instant; it was as though nothing had happened at all.\u201cPu!\u201dAll of a sudden, there was a stream of fire that went by his head.\u00a0The hair that Zhang He had painstakingly grown over the past month burned up again.Xiao Chen did not infuse much Essence into this flame, so while it was very quickly executed, it also disappeared very quickly too; it was extinguished after just two seconds. However, Zhang He\u2019s hair was completely burned. There was a certain burning stench coming from his head and azure smoke coming off it.The surrounding people quickly scattered and hid. The Xiao Clan\u2019s crowd all started to laugh out loud. Even some Tang Clan disciples who were with them, secretly snickered.\u201cXiao Chen!\u201d Zhang He shouted out with a\u00a0cracked voice. He could no longer keep his emotions calm.Under instruction from the elder leveled cultivators, some of the Zhang Clan disciples beside him were holding on to the raging Zhang He, preventing him from rushing out.Tang Feng was unable to continue just watching. He held the Ice Fire Bow in his hand and said to Xiao Chen, \u201cXiao Chen, don\u2019t go overboard. Don\u2019t you think this is too much?\u201dOverboard? Too much?\u00a0Xiao Chen smiled coldly in his heart.\u00a0After pointing to my nose and threatening me in front of so many people, you actually say that I\u2019m going overboard? Does the world revolve around them in the eyes of these people?Xiao Chen said coldly, \u201cI said it before, I will not try to reason with a dog. When a dog barks at me, I will take action instead of trying to reason with it.\u201dSeeing Tang Feng\u2019s state of disbelief, Xiao Chen sighed quietly in his heart,\u00a0Indeed, everything in this world is decided by strength.If his opponent did not see that Liu Fengyin was here, he would be the one humiliated. He did not believe that Zhang He came over to greet him because he had not seen Xiao Chen for a long time and had missed him.Zhang He and Tang Feng obviously wanted to make use of their advantage in numbers to thoroughly humiliate him. Only, they did not expect that Liu Fengyin would be present too. Thus, they ended up suffering a huge disadvantage.After a long time, The burnt odor on Zhang He\u2019s head faded away. He truly no longer wished to remain here. He appeared to want to say something before he brought his people away from this place.However, when he thought of what happened earlier, he suppressed the words he wanted to say. Instead, he glared at Xiao Chen fiercely.Xiao Yulan and the others were no longer in the mood to shop after that bunch of people caused such trouble. Before they left, Xiao Chen looked at the hundred meter tall statue of the Tianwu Emperor behind him.Thinking to himself,\u00a0He had the supreme Heavenly Flame that was capable of burning down the entire continent. With his own personal strength, he was able to unite the continent and establish his own dynasty. These were the legends about the Tianwu Emperor.Even after ten thousand years, after the Tianwu dynasty was destroyed, the people were still unable to forget the Tianwu Emperor. This was how awe inspiring the Emperor of that generation was.During his generation, there were many other outstanding people. However, they were all overshadowed by him, turning into stepping stones for him before their existences were finally lost in the river of time.Would I, Xiao Chen, be like the Tianwu Emperor after ten thousand years? Standing tall for a long time, achieving immortality? Or would I become a stepping stone for others?\u2026It was late at night, the moon was high, and stars filled the sky.Xiao Residence, Within Xiao Chen\u2019s Courtyard:After Xiao Chen came back, he immediately continued to draw talismans. As night approached, he examined the hand written Manual of the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique carefully.Ever since this book was handed to Xiao Chen, he had not had the time to take a look. At this moment, after he began looking it over, he was immediately absorbed in it.Rushing Thunder Chop\u2026 It was originally just a Superior Grade Yellow Ranked Martial Technique. However, the next few moves that were chained after it increased its might by several times, causing it to reach the standard of a Superior Grade Profound Ranked Martial Technique.He had inherited the Battle Sage Origin\u2019s Changing Character Formula from the Thunder Emperor. As long as a Martial Technique was executed in front of him once, he would be able to imitate at least 80% to 90% of it.Although its power would be slightly decreased, once he comprehended the essence of it, it would even be possible to surpass the original might of the Martial Technique.The Rushing Thunder Chop was something that Xiao Chen had practised for quite awhile. After he saw Feng Feixue use it that time, he immediately understood the essence of this Rushing Thunder Saber Technique. Thus, he was able to rapidly and completely replicate it using the Changing Character FormulaNow that he had the complete manual of the Changing Character Formula, his comprehension of its essence went up by another level. He was even able to comprehend the final move in the saber technique, the Rushing Thunder Third Chain Chop.\u201cPu!\u201dIn the silence of the night, suddenly there was a muffled scream. This was the cry of a person who had his mouth covered shortly before his death.Although the sound was very soft, after Xiao Chen became a Martial Master, his five senses were raised significantly. He was slightly startled in his heart,\u00a0Could it be that the Zhang Clan and Tang Clan came to kill them?\u201cBang! Bang! Bang!\u201dThe sounds of battle grew louder and louder. Miserable cries echoed continually. Xiao Chen hurriedly released his Spiritual Sense, and in that instant everything in the Xiao Clan was visible to him.Via his Spiritual Sense, there were three shadows killing openly. The speed of the three was \u00a0extremely fast, and practically no one was a match for them. The elite guards of the Xiao Clan were as weak as paper to them; with just a light hit, they would be shattered into pieces.Martial Saints! There were actually three Martial Saint Experts. Xiao Chen was startled and his heart was thrown into turmoil,\u00a0Why would there be three Martial Saints Experts appearing in Mohe City?The faces of the three of them were masked, and they did not indulge in the battle. They were very fast, and they only dealt with the people directly in their way.Xiao Chen checked the direction they were travelling in and suddenly realized their targets were Xiao Yulan, Xiao Jian, and himself. These were all the participants of the Promise of Ten Years.It was indeed the work of the Zhang Clan and Tang Clan. Seeing the disciples that died miserably, Xiao Chen clenched his fist furiously. He was bleeding in his heart; there was a strong killing intent in his heart.Where was Liu Fengyin?Xiao Chen turned his attention to another area and he saw Liu Fengyin\u2019s figure. He was currently occupied by a blue clothed person. He was already having difficulties protecting himself and was unable to get away.At an even further location, the First Elder led a group of Martial Grand Masters. However, they were delayed by a powerful Martial Saint. That person did not kill them, but when someone came to provide assistance, he would immediately hold them back.There were actually five Martial Saint Experts here. The situation was bad. Xiao Chen hurriedly left his room and rushed to Bao`er\u2019s room.\u201cYoung Master, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Bao`er said with a panicked expression as she walked out from the room; she had heard the miserable cries of the people coming from the outside.Xiao Chen was about to explain when suddenly an overwhelming killing intent came over. That shocking aura was about to put pressure on someone, even though they were not near yet.Xiao Chen pushed Bao`er back into her room and quickly told her, \u201cQuickly go back to your room. Remember, regardless of what you hear, do not come out.\u201d\u201cRemember, regardless of what you hear, you absolutely must not come out.\u201dAlthough Bao`er was slightly confused, she had never seen Xiao Chen reveal such an anxious expression before. Thus, she obeyed his words and ran back to her room.Suddenly, a figure appeared on the\u00a0walls\u00a0of the courtyard. There was a sword dripping with blood in his hands. A black cloth covered his face, preventing people from seeing what he looked like; His eyes were glowing, glaring at Xiao Chen.\u201cPu Ci!\u201dThe black clothed person waved his sword, and a 66 centimeter long blue sword Qi was sent flying at Xiao Chen. This was the true sword Qi, a characteristic of a Martial Saint sword user, unlike the sword Qi that Zhang He used by means of his Holy Sword Martial Saint.[TL note: 66 centimeters is 2 zhang. It's a Chinese unit of measurement where 3 zhang is one meter.]The sword Qi surged over, and very soon it arrived in front of Xiao Chen. Xiao Chen knew he could not defend against this, so he hurriedly retreated backward.\u201cBang!\u201dXiao Chen\u2019s front foot shifted and the sword Qi slashed the area where he was standing just a moment prior. With a loud exploding sound, a deep pit was created on the ground.Streams of Qi waves scattered in all directions, and dust flew everywhere. Xiao Chen was still in midair, and had not yet landed, when he was caught up in the Qi wave. His body was blasted backward, crashing onto the ground with a loud \u2018bang\u2019.This was the might of just one sword slash. A Martial Saint Expert was indeed strong. Xiao Chen was very startled in his heart. The figure on the wall suddenly disappeared.In the next instant, he reappeared above Xiao Chen, his sword emitting a 66 centimeters long sword Qi. The might of this strike was matchless as it descended down from the sky.At this moment, no matter how powerful a Martial Technique was, it would be useless because there was no time for him to use them at all. Xiao Chen\u2019s hand moved quickly and the wooden sculpture, that was carved from the Spiritual Wood, was thrown up above his head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When her long spear moved slightly, the surrounding space seemed to freeze up.Yue Ying blew a long whistle and the nine dragon shadows behind here surged forward. The streams of dragon shadow and the supreme might of the dragon entered the spear, causing its golden glow to rise to its peak. The spear was sent towards the sword strike the black clothed man sent from the sky.\u201cBang!\u201dAs the golden light came in contact with that 6.6 meters long sword Qi, it gave off a loud sound. A Qi wave that was visible with the naked eye blasted out in all directions.After the black clothed man landed, he quickly backed off. He looked at Yue Ying, who had suddenly appeared, with a cautious expression. He could not understand... How did a girl with a strength at least equal to a Martial Saint appear beside Xiao Chen?\u201cWho are you? How are you related to the Xiao Residence?\u201dYue Ying did not answer, nor was she able to. She raised the spear in her hand, and nine streams of dragon shadow flew up again. The black clothed man struck out in retaliation, fighting with Yue Ying at close quarters.Seeing the two of them fight, Xiao Chen did not know whether to join the fight or retreat. This Life Bestowal Spell may be strong, but it could not be sustained for long. Against a Martial Saint Expert, it definitely would not be able to kill him.If he left here now, it would mean leaving Bao`er here alone; that was too dangerous.\u201cChi!\u201dSuddenly, a white colored firework rose high in the sky above Xiao Yulan\u2019s courtyard. Xiao Chen\u2019s heart stopped for a second; he had a bad feeling about this. His hurriedly sent his Spiritual Sense in that direction.In the middle of the courtyard, many Xiao Clan disciples laid on the floor, dead. Xiao Yulan was lying in the middle, and her face was pale as fresh blood continuously flowed from the corner of her mouth. It was unclear whether she was alive or not. There was a black clothed man leaving rapidly at the back.Cousin Yulan! Xiao Chen felt a pinch in his heart. He wanted to execute the Lightning Evasion to hurry over to take a look.\u201cThinking of running? That\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d the black clothed man saw that Xiao Chen was intending to leave. He hurriedly used his sword to brush away Yue Ying\u2019s attack and leaped forward fiercely. A lightning fast sword strike was chopping towards Xiao Chen.Xiao Chen hurriedly executed the Lightning Evasion, retreating backwards quickly. His eyes were bloodshot as he shouted, \u201cYou bastard, don\u2019t force me!\u201dThe black clothed man laughed coldly, \u201cJust an insignificant Martial Master. What qualifications do you have to say this to me?\u201dAfter he said this he ignored Yue Ying, who was rushing over to attack him, and raised his sword to kill Xiao Chen. The earlier white firework meant that one of them had already succeeded.Feeling anxious in his heart, he did not wish to delay this. Even if he had to suffer an attack, he wanted to severely injure Xiao Chen.Xiao Chen continued to retreat backward as he casually threw out a grade three talisman. The talisman rapidly opened up in midair before turning into an intense fireball, exploding in the air.With the talisman as the center, a large amount of flames and shock waves blasted out in all directions. The air was instantly burnt up as an earth shattering, surging heatwave engulfed the area.\u201cBoom!\u201dA biting cold energy exploded out from the black clothed man\u2019s body. The flames that were nearest to his body were immediately dispersed. The black clothed man felt disdain in his heart. It seemed this powerful flame was not even worth mentioning in his eyes.However, the talisman in the air did not disappear when the flames were dispersed. It continued to hover, giving off a bright radiance, before exploding again.\u201cHu!\u201dAn extremely cold Qi blasted out into the surroundings. This air seemed to have frozen up. The surrounding temperature instantly decreased by more than a hundred degrees celsius. The cold air caused one to tremble when they breathed.The black clothed man quickly stopped, feeling shocked in his heart, but he did not panic. He circulated the Essence in his body, and instantly expelled the cold Qi from himself.\u201cPi Ci!\u201dThe heatwave that was dispersed earlier suddenly came surging back from all directions, interacting with the cold Qi in the air. The black clothed man suddenly felt uneasy. There was an endless cold Qi on his left side and a surging heatwave on his right.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe incompatible elements came in contact with each other. When the two opposite energies reached a certain level, they exploded abruptly. It was much stronger that the earlier ones. With the black clothed man as the center point, there was an explosion.The black clothed man was caught off guard, and was blasted out. Although he appeared to be in a sorry state, he did not suffer any major injuries.Before he was able to stand stable, nine streams of golden dragon shadows were heading towards him rapidly. These nine dragon shadows contained the Dragon Qi that Xiao Chen infused within Yue Ying\u2019s sculpture. Its strength was not weak. If struck by it, even a Martial Saint would suffer a serious injury,\u201cMartial Technique, Pushing Clouds Gazing At SunThe black clothed man did not dare to be careless as he hurriedly executed his own Profound Ranked Martial Technique. A bright radiance blossomed from his sword blade, cutting apart the darkness as though he was slicing apart dark clouds. The sword blade was as bright as the sun.The strong Martial Techniques of the two of them collided with each other. The stone table in Xiao Chen\u2019s courtyard was shattered into dust as a result of the energy waves.Xiao Chen was not in the mood to continue zealously fighting. He sent out his Spiritual Sense again and discovered that Xiao Yulan\u2019s originally open eyes were already closed. His complexion turned even more pale. There were a few people rushing over from the side, picking her up in a fluster, and bringing her to the Xiao Clan\u2019s dispensary.Xiao Chen\u2019s heart was now completely at a loss. He wanted to immediately send over a Blood Replenishing Pill. He raised his legs with the intent to leave.\u201cI said before, you cannot leave!\u201d the black clothed man threw off Yue Ying again, and chased after Xiao Chen.Just then, another firework rose high into the sky. Another person had succeeded. According to the plan, it was time to retreat. However, he still had yet to even touch Xiao Chen\u2019s body.Xiao Chen\u2019s eyes were bloodshot as he shouted lividly, \u201cYou bastard! I said not to force me any further! Did you not hear me?\u201d\u201cMartial Technique, Wind From All Directions!\u201dThe black clothed man raised his sword and countless sword shadows appeared everywhere. A whirlwind was formed, blowing up all the dirt on the ground instantly.\u201cHu!\u201dThe whirlwind came to the black clothed man, causing him to fly high in the air. He shouted angrily in the sky and the sword shadows all returned. The light on his sword grew longer by a fold.\u201cHeavenly Lightning Shield!\u201dWith the assistance of the whirlwind, the speed of the black clothed man was incredibly fast. Xiao Chen would not be able to evade in time; he could only use the Heavenly Lightning Shield to defend. A shield, made out of electricity and in the shape of the \u2018\u91d1\u2019 character, instantly wrapped around Xiao Chen.\u201cBang!\u201dThe sword light attack struck the Heavenly Lightning Shield and gave off a muffled sound. There were tiny cracks appearing in the Heavenly Lightning Shield and after a short moment, it was completely broken down.The huge force of the sword light immediately blasted Xiao Chen flying. A bloody wound appeared on his right shoulder. If Xiao Chen\u2019s Heavenly Lightning Shield had not blocked that attack, it would have been sufficient to chop Xiao Chen into halves.As Xiao Chen took out a Blood Replenishing Pill and placed it in his mouth, he smiled bitterly to himself. In front of absolute strength, all strategies and tricks are useless, no matter how ingenious they are.Just like now, he could imitate the Wind From All Directions. However, before he would be able to fly up in the the air, he would be sliced into two halves.Only by using the Return of the Azure Dragon could he possibly injure this person. Or else, even when he was killed, he would not be able to injure him at all.\u00a0In front of absolute strength, one could only use a strength that was stronger.With just a single thought, Yue Ying\u2019s body glowed with a magnificent golden light. The nine dragon shadows continuously circled around her, and she issued a dragon\u2019s hiss.The black clothed man looked coldly at Yue Ying. He did not pay too much attention to her. After exchanging blows with her, he had already figured out her weak point. She was not agile enough, she did not have the movement techniques and reactions of a Martial Saint Expert, only her strength was at the Martial Saint level.Seeing blood flowing from the wound on Xiao Chen\u2019s right shoulder, the black clothed man said to himself indifferently, \u201cJust one more strike and I can leave this place.\u201d\u201cBoundless Azure Sea!\u201dSuddenly, a boundless sea appeared behind Yue Ying. An azure dragon broke out from the sea and roared loudly. It circled in the sky for a while, before rushing at the black clothed man.It actually was an Earth Ranked Martial Technique,\u00a0the black clothed man thought in shock. It\u2019s a Martial Technique from the Imperial courts; how did this girl obtain it?\u201cBang!\u201dWhat a fast speed!\u00a0This was the final thought in the black clothed man\u2019s head before he was hit by the azure dragon\u2019s attack. With a loud sound, a three-meter pit appeared on the ground. Countless cracks extended out in all directions.\u201cRumble...!\u201dWhen the cracks extended to the walls of the courtyard, the walls immediately crumbled. In the next instant, all the buildings in the courtyard collapsed. This was because the foundations were damaged, causing all of them to fall over abruptly.Xiao Chen protected himself with his two arms in front of him. After he was forced by the Qi wave a few steps, he managed to slowly stabilize himself. He looked towards Bao`er\u2019s room with some worry and discovered that she was trapped beneath a beam. Xiao Chen looked at the scene with eyes filled with fear and worry.As long as everything is fine,\u00a0Xiao Chen breathed out in relief.After Yue Ying used this move, she immediately turned into a beam of golden light and flew to Xiao Chen\u2019s hands, turning back into a wooden statue.Seeing that the glow of the wooden statue had dimmed significantly, Xiao Chen felt distressed in his heart. The Boundless Azure Sea can only be used two more times before the wooden sculpture was used up.Within the deep pit, the black clothed man slowly stood up. Blood trickled out from the corner of his mouth. He had not expected that he would actually get injured on this mission.With a gentle leap, the black clothed man was standing back on the ground. What caused him to feel surprised was that he was no longer about to sense that Martial Saint Expert.He suddenly thought of something and spoke to Xiao Chen, \u201cThe person earlier\u2026 That is\u00a0some kind of secret treasure,\u00a0right? Now that the secret treasure has vanished, you still did not leave? I\u2019m surprised.\u201dXiao Chen gently waved his hands and the Lunar Shadow Saber, laying on the ground in the distant corner, flew back into his hands. An electrical glow radiated from the saber blade, and the energy of the Rank 6 Demonic Core was released completely.The eyes of the black clothed man brightened and he said indifferently, \u201cI will be taking this Demonic Weapon!\u201dXiao Chen looked coldly at the black clothed man walking slowly toward him. The Essence in his body was circulating according to the methods of the Dragon Subduing Slash. The Essence circulated rapidly as he stored up strength and waited for an opportunity to use the Return of the Azure Dragon.\u201cBang!\u201dJust as Xiao Chen was about to use the Return of the Azure Dragon, there was the sound of ground breaking coming from the distance. A human figure broke through layers of barriers, and flew high into the sky.Martial King?The two of them stopped what they were doing, but the expressions on their faces were different. Xiao Chen knew that he was saved. However, the black clothed man did not hesitate to quickly flee, executing his movement techniques to the extreme.The human figure in the sky was the Xiao Clan Head that had been in isolation training, Xiao Xiong. There were rumbling sounds coming from around him continuously. In an instant, he flew to the front of the black clothed man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the next instant, he landed behind the black clothed man. When the black clothed man heard the sound, he immediately turned around and slashed out with his sword.With a \u2018hu\u2019 sound, Xiao Xiong immediately moved to the back of the black clothed man again and struck out with his palm, attacking his back.\u201cKa ka!\u201d this was the sound of his bones breaking.The black clothed man took a deep breath in pain, and when he turned around again, all he saw was a shadow flashing by; Xiao Xiong had moved to his back once again and struck him with his palm once more.\u201cPu Ci!\u201dThe black clothed man spat out a mouthful of blood.\u201cBang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\u201dXiao Xiong\u2019s body position kept constantly changing as he continued sending out palm strikes against the black clothed man\u2019s body. As for the black clothed man, he was not even able to touch the corner of Xiao Xiong\u2019s clothes. Blood kept flowing out of his mouth; he was completely helpless, and was not able to retaliate at all.\u201cHu! Hu!\u201dSuddenly, the strong Martial Saint in the distance who was obstructing Xiao Qiang and the others, flew over, sending a palm strike at Xiao Xiong.Xiao Xiong gave up on the black clothed man and exchanged blows with that person. \u201cBoom!\u201d There was a muffled sound as small ripples appeared in the surrounding air.The two of them retreated backward a few steps before they began exchanging blows with each other again in the next instant. Their hands and feet were moving everywhere, the wind from their palms was like thunder; their speed was incredibly fast.Xiao Chen, who was standing at the side, could not even see the shadow of the two of them; he could only hear the unending explosive sounds, and the ripples through the air. Xiao Chen was secretly shocked in his heart; even if it were a Martial Grand Master coming in contact with the ripples in the air, they would immediately be shattered into dust.Xiao Chen turned his gaze to the now incredibly weak black clothed man. His face revealed a dark smile as he walk towards him, slowly.\u201cWhat are you thinking of doing\u2026?\u201d That black clothed man said anxiously when he saw Xiao Chen walking over with an equally dark expression on his face.He was severely injured by Xiao Xiong earlier, but with his battle prowess now, even an Inferior Grade Martial Disciple would be able to kill him easily.Xiao Chen could not be bothered to talk crap with him. He kicked him flying toward the ground. The black clothed man grunted in pain. Just as he was about to speak, Xiao Chen stomped down on him ruthlessly. The black clothed man shouted out in pain as he swallowed back everything he wanted to say.The strong and mighty Martial Saint was stomped on by an Inferior Grade Martial Master like Xiao Chen. The black clothed man felt incredibly sullen in his heart.\u201cXiao Chen, let go of my hand now! Or else, I will kill you in the future!\u201d the black clothed man shouted out loudly.Xiao Chen ruthlessly stomped on his face with his feet as he smiled coldly, \u201cDo you think that you still have the opportunity to do so? I told you before, do not force me. Did you not hear me earlier?\u201dAfter he said that, Xiao Chen stomped ruthlessly on his face a few more times. The cloth covering over his face fell off, revealing the face of an old man.Even though his face was covered in Xiao Chen\u2019s footprints, Xiao Chen did not have the intention of killing him so simply; that was letting him off too easily.When he thought of the dead disciples of the Xiao Clan, and Xiao Yulan whose status was currently unknown, Xiao Chen\u2019s heart raged in anger. A cold gleam filled his black pupils as he picked up the black clothed man.\u201cPa! Pa! Pa!\u201dSlaps after slaps were delivered to his face. The originally extremely pale face of the black clothed man was slapped until became red and swollen.After Xiao Chen was done slapping him, Xiao Chen raised his foot and kicked him flying again. Wielding the Lunar Shadow Saber in his hand, Xiao Chen dashed rapidly to the front. With a flash of the saber, it pierced towards the heart of the black clothed man.\u201cHu!\u201dThe two men battling with Xiao Xiong suddenly scattered. In a flash, a palm strike was sent at Xiao Chen. When Xiao Chen heard the rustling of the wind, we quickly evaded. That person did not continue to pursue him; instead, he picked up the black clothed man and dashed forward quickly.Just one more strike and I could have killed him!\u00a0Xiao Chen felt dissatisfaction as he watched the two men leave the place.Xiao Xiong did not chase after the two men. While looking at Xiao Chen, he said, \u201cCome with me!\u201dThis was the first time Xiao Chen saw his father from this world with his own eyes. He was not used to this, but he dared not disobey his words, so he obediently followed him.\u201cSecond Young Master, are you alright?\u201d Bao`er asked worriedly when she came out from the rubble of the house and saw the wound on Xiao Chen\u2019s shoulder.Xiao Chen said indifferently, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Follow me for now. It\u2019s not safe here.\u201dThe two of them followed Xiao Xiong, and before long, they saw Xiao Qiang leading a big group of cultivators who were rushing over. When Xiao Qiang saw Xiao Xiong, he immediately knelt down and said, \u201cThis old man is incompetent, causing our Xiao Clan disciples to be gravely injured. Clan head, please punish me!\u201d\u201cWould Clan Head please punish us!\u201d The large group of people behind all knelt down and said.Xiao Xiong frowned. He stomped heavily on the group with his right foot. The crowd only felt a gentle breeze pulling their bodies up.\u201cFirst Elder, go count how many deaths there are and save all those who are still alive without sparing any effort. Regardless of the grade of herbs, as long as they are in the dispensary, you may use them.\u201dXiao Xiong faced Xiao Qiang and carried on saying, \u201cThis matter cannot be blamed on you. I am at fault too. I will wait for you in the great hall.\u201d\u2026Xiao Residence Great hall:Xiao Xiong sat on the chair in the middle of the great hall and looked at Xiao Chen, \u201cI hear that you have obtained the inheritance of the Thunder Emperor?\u201dXiao Chen nodded his head in acknowledgement and handed the Lunar Shadow Saber over to Xiao Xiong.Xiao Xiong took the Lunar Shadow Saber and examined it carefully. After a long while, he smiled warmly, \u201cTo think that your cultivation talent was so mediocre when you were young. Now that you have obtained the inheritance of the Thunder Emperor, your accomplishments might possibly become the highest in the Xiao Clan.\u201dXiao Chen took back the Lunar Shadow Saber and then muttered to himself irresolutely for a while before finally speaking out the doubt that he had in his heart, \u201cFather, since you have already become a Martial King, why did you not chase after those two persons?\u201dXiao Xiong sighed, \u201cYou probably saw that I was flying in the air and thought that I was already at the Martial King realm. Actually, my current realm has only reached peak Martial Saint.\u201d\u201cThe Leng Clan head, who fought with me at the end, also knew that. I am only able to fly because of my wind attributed Martial Spirit, despite my cultivation only being at peak Martial Saint. However, my speed is much slower than that of a true Martial King.\u201dXiao Chen suddenly understood,\u00a0So there was actually such a reason; this all makes sense now.Just at this moment, Xiao Qiang brought a few people over and greeted Xiao Xiong respectfully, \u201cI have already tallied up the numbers of the dead and injured. There were a total of 150 people injured, of which 90 had died. Out of the 90 dead, there were three Martial Grand Masters.\u201dEveryone present took a deep breath of cold air when Xiao Qiang said this. There were actually that many casualties. A big portion of these people were the elite disciples of the Xiao Clan, many of whom were of the Xiao Clan\u2019s descent.Furthermore, there were Martial Grand Masters amongst the dead. As Martial Grand Masters, they could be considered as the finest fighting force in Mohe City. Even the Xiao Clan did not have many Martial Grand Masters.\u201cClan Head, should we inform City Lord Dugu? By doing this, they are going overboard! This is war!?\u201d One of the Xiao Clan elders said angrily.Xiao Qiang said helplessly, \u201cThe people who made a move were the Leng Clan. With Misty Sword Sect backing them, City Lord Dugu cannot do anything against them. Furthermore, they all masked themselves, and they left behind no evidence at all.\u201dXiao Xiong said, \u201cWhat about Yulan and Xiao Jian? Are their lives in danger?\u201dXiao Xiong\u2019s expression turned sullen, \u201cTheir Martial Spirits were severely injured. They will not be able to fight for at least half a month.\u201dHearing this news, the everyone\u2019s complexions in the great hall changed. The Promise of Ten Years was going to start in a week, but these two people who were confirmed for the competition were not able to fight.This move of the Leng Clan was too vicious... To directly injure the participants of the Xiao Clan. Furthermore, according to the rules, once they confirmed their participants, they could not change them. This meant that the Xiao Clan could only send out Xiao Chen to fight.When Xiao Chen heard this news, he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart,\u00a0At least their lives are not in danger.\u00a0\u201cFather, I wish to take my leave for a while to go see Cousin Yulan.\u201dXiao Xiong nodded his head, then he seemed to suddenly remember something and said, \u201cWait for a moment.\u201dXiao Chen stopped walking and asked with some doubts, \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d He was unsure why, but he felt some fear towards this man, who was his father in name only.Xiao Xiong walked to Xiao Chen\u2019s front and said, \u201cDon't move, let me see your Martial Spirit.\u201dMartial Spirit again, Xiao Chen was surprised.\u00a0The First elder had also checked his Martial Spirit multiple times. Now Xiao Xiong wanted to check his Martial Spirit too?! What was going on?After a while, Xiao Chen felt a stream of gentle Essence, along with a consciousness, entering his body. Xiao Chen sank his consciousness down and used it to hide his original Martial Spirit, then he used his consciousness to imitate a purple flame.After Xiao Xiong saw that, the expression on his face turned much warmer, \u201cA Martial Spirit made out of pure purple flames. I will give you a few fire attributed Martial Techniques another day.\u201dCold sweat covered his back as Xiao Chen nodded his head in thanks. The doubts in his heart grew greater, he must know something,\u00a0Is he afraid of the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit in my body?Xiao Residence, Within the Dispensary:After Xiao Chen asked around and obtained the location of Xiao Yulan\u2019s room, he rushed over in a hurry.\u201cCousin Yulan, are you asleep? I am Xiao Chen,\u201d Xiao Chen said from outside the doors.\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, come in. I\u2019m not asleep yet,\u201d a weak voice came from inside the room, but the voice sounded happy.Xiao Chen pushed open the door and entered. He saw Xiao Yulan, dressed in a white nightgown, struggling to sit up. There was a faint smile on her pale face, but her knitted eyebrows revealed that the action was painful for her.Xiao Chen quickly rushed over, took out a Blood Replenishing Pill and gave it to her, \u201cCousin Yulan, don\u2019t move yet. Take this Blood Replenishing Pill first. Although it will not heal the injuries of your Martial Spirit, it should heal your internal injuries very quickly.\u201dShe blushed slightly as she received the Blood Replenishing Pill, and swallowed it unhesitatingly. She immediately felt a cooling sensation, and the pain from her internal injuries was immediately reduced significantly.\u201cThank You, Cousin Xiao Chen.\u201dXiao Chen smiled gently, \u201cThere is no need to be so courteous. Back then, you saved me once. Giving you a Blood Replenishing Pill is nothing compared to the fact that you saved my life. This is truly nothing.\u201d\u201cIf there is nothing else, then I shall be leaving first. Cousin Yulan, have a good rest.\u201dHearing these words, Xiao Yulan felt a pang in her heart,\u00a0Was it only just to repay that gratitude?Seeing that Xiao Chen was about to leave, Xiao Yulan suddenly said, \u201cCousin Xiao Chen, wait for a bit.\u201dXiao Chen stopped. Feeling something was off, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dXiao Yulan wanted to say something, but after thinking for a long time she did not know how to start the conversation. Her pretty face blushed before finally saying, \u201cCousin Xiao Chen, I can\u2019t sleep. Can you stay here and chat with me?\u201dXiao Chen was mildly surprised, but he smiled and said, \u201cSure, of course I can.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 81:\u00a0Ninth Heaven\u2019s Thunder FormationXiao Clan, About 1000 Meters High in the Sky:Xiao Chen executed the Gravity Spell and flew high in the sky; his hair and clothes fluttered about in the cold wind.He released his Spiritual Sense, and the dark night was unable to obstruct his senses. The entirety of the Xiao Residence appeared in Xiao Chen\u2019s mind.Ever since he came out of Xiao Yulan\u2019s room, he saw many injured Xiao Clan disciples leaving the dispensary. His heart was unable to find peace; it was only five Martial Saint Experts, but they were able to slaughter the Xiao Clan without significant resistance.Actually, Xiao Chen had the opportunity to prevent this tragedy from happening; there were many records of formations on the Compendium of Cultivation. All he needed to do was to lay down a large formation and it would definitely be able to obstruct those five Martial Saint experts.However, the amount of energy this formation required was far more than what his current cultivation level could provide. Furthermore, he had thought that within Mohe City it would be impossible for the Xiao Clan to suffer from such a huge attack.It seemed that his previous thought was too naive. The attraction of Seven Horn Mountain was much greater than he had imagined.Suddenly Xiao Chen opened his eyes and descended slowly towards the ground, landing on a piece of high ground in the southwest of the Xiao Residence. He used his senses again and muttered to himself, \u201cThis should be the Qian position; the Qian position represents the heavens, and the Kun position represents earth. With the Qian position settled, the other position should be easy to find.\u201d[TL notes: \u4e7e Qian and \u5764 Kun are positions on the Eight Trigrams. The meanings are explained above, but when the two characters are placed together it means heaven and earth, or universe. This is where the name of the Universe Ring came from, the Qiankun Ring.]After he muttered that, Xiao Chen took out some Talisman Paper, a brush, and the purple fluid made from a mixture of Spirit Beast\u2019s blood and Demonic Core. Then, he took out a small knife and made a small cut on his hand.Xiao Chen circulated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation, infusing the Essence in his body into his blood. Instantly, the blood that flowed out from the cut in his hand gave off a faint glow. As it dripped into the purple fluid, he gave off a golden light.His face slowly turned pale and his lips turned purple; Xiao Chen felt dizzy, but he gritted his teeth and persisted.This is the Ninth Heaven\u2019s Thunder Formation. It was not something that he should be able to lay at his current cultivation level. In order to forcibly do it, he had to use his own blood essence.When the purple fluid in the ink bottle completely turned a golden hue, Xiao Chen stopped circulating the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation. His complexion improved when he stopped the bleeding from the wound.Holding the brush in his right hand, Xiao Chen dipped it into the amber-colored Spiritual Fluid. He had a solemn expression as he drew rapidly on the Talisman Paper.The Talisman Paper gave off a brilliant, yellow glow as he did so. When Xiao Chen finally completed his last stroke, the Talisman Paper immediately burst out in a golden light, then it folded itself up rapidly and landed in Xiao Chen\u2019s hand.Xiao Chen held the Talisman in his right hand as he drew an equally gold-colored circle on the ground with his left hand, then a faint golden \u4e7e (Qian) character appeared within the circle.The right hand holding the Talisman pointed towards the ground, and with a quick wave of his hands he quickly threw it into the golden circle.\u201cBoom!\u201dThere was a sudden clap of thunder, and a streak of lightning tore across the sky. As though guided by something, it went directly inside the glowing circle. The light faded off and the ground looked normal again, as if nothing had happened to it.However, via Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense, he could tell that the Talisman, which was filled with Xiao Chen\u2019s blood essence, was brimming with the boundless energy of heavenly thunder. It just required a thought from him and it could be immediately activated.\u201cQian, Zhen, Li, Xun, Kun, Dui, Kan, Gen\u2026 The next position is the Zhen position. It\u2019s corresponding nature is thunder. I have to find the location where the thunder attribute is the most dense. I also have to look for locations that correspond to the other positions of the Eight Trigrams,\u201d[TL notes: \u4e7e Qian, \u9707Zhen, \u79bb Li, \u5dfd Xun, \u5764 Kun, \u5151 Dui, \u574e Kan, \u826e Gen. These are the eight positions.}Xiao Chen said to himself. He had already found the suitable position for the Eight Trigrams when he was in the sky earlier. All that was left for him to do was to find the location with the densest thunder attribute.Two hours later, Xiao Chen inserted a Talisman full of his blood essence into each of the eight positions: Qian, Zhen, Li, Xun, Kun, Dui, Kan, and Gen; as well as their corresponding nature: heaven, thunder, fire, wind, earth, marsh, water, mountain.Xiao Chen closed his eyes gently and, within his Spiritual Sense, a majestic formation appeared around the surroundings of the Xiao Residence. There was faint flickering lightning high in the sky, and the entire Ninth Heaven\u2019s Thunder Formation was finally completed. Xiao Chen raised both his hands to feel this boundless and surging force of heaven and earth. With just a hand seal, even if there was a magnificent army with thousands of men and horses, he had the confidence this could destroy them all.When he opened his eyes, a strong sense of fatigue overwhelmed his brain. Xiao Chen felt dizzy and his legs trembled. After a while, he could no longer withstand it and he fell unconsciousness onto the ground with a \u2018pu tong\u2019 sound.\u2026Mohe City, Tang Clan, Within the Secret Chamber:The Zhang Clan Head and the Tang Clan Head as well as the five Martial Saints that just returned from the Xiao Clan were present...\u201cClan head, let\u2019s not wait for the Promise of Ten Years. After I recover from my injuries, let\u2019s go destroy their Xiao Clan. That Xiao Chen is too vicious,\u201d the Martial Saint humiliated by Xiao Chen said angrily.The blue clothed man said, \u201cLeng Zeyu, did you not see that the Xiao Clan head already came out of isolation and is a Martial King? Do you think we stand a chance?\u201d\u201cYou as a Martial Saint are not even able to handle an Inferior Grade Martial Master. I truly feel ashamed for you.\u201dLeng Zeyu\u2019s expression darkened as he said angrily, \u201cLan Chaoyang, what do you mean? If you truly ran into a Martial King\u00a0expert, you probably would not be alive.\u201d\u201cWhat I mean is\u2026\u201d Lan Chaoyang sneered, \u201cyou are not focusing on the that fact you were beaten up and are recklessly giving commands.\u201d\u201cAlright! Stop fighting!\u201d the Leng Clan Head, Leng Zhengyun suddenly said. His voice was not loud, nor did it carry any emotion, but the two people arguing did not dare to say anything else.Leng Zhengyun glared at Leng Zeyu, \u201cZeyu, stop speaking nonsense in the future. Although Xiao Xiong played a part, the responsibility of the failure of this operation lies with you. This is because you took too long to do your job.\u201dLeng Zeyu felt dissatisfied and pouted, but he did not dare to retort to that, \u201cI understand. It was my fault. I did not grasp the opportunity.\u201dLeng Zhengyun shifted his gaze to Lan Chaoyang, \u201cChaoyang, in this matter of the Seven Horn Mountain, without a doubt, your contributions are the greatest. However, do not carry over your personal grudges into this operation.\u201d\u201cFounding a sect... What this means is that my Leng Clan is betting our wealth and foundations on this. I do not wish for anything to go wrong. If we end up failing, you know what I will do\u2026\u201dLan Chaoyang lowered his head and said, \u201cI understand. I just could not resist. I will pay note of it in the future.\u201dWhen Leng Zhengyun saw the attitudes of the two man, the expression on his face turned warmer. He said, \u201cWhen a big ordinary clan reaches a certain stage, and wants to progress further, there are only two paths: starting a sect, or turning into a Noble Clan.\u201dLeng Zhengyun carried on, saying as he sighed, \u201cOur Leng Clan does not possess any god given bloodlines, thus the only path we can take is that of starting a sect. If it were not for the fact that there is only Seven Horn Mountain within the Qizi County, I truly would not have wished to take actions against the Xiao Clan.\u201dThe envy of a god given bloodline could be seen in Leng Zhengyun\u2019s words. If he had such a bloodline, then he would not have to bet the efforts of hundreds of years of the Leng Clan\u2019s effort to take action against the Xiao Clan.The risk involved was not something an ordinary person could understand. Although the Xiao Clan\u2019s might could no longer compare to what it had been in the past, they were still not an existence that anyone could just trample over.Tang Tian stood at the side, listening for a long time. Now that he had the chance, he said somewhat worriedly, \u201cElder Leng, is Xiao Xiong really out of his isolation and now a Martial King?\u201dThe Zhang Clan Head standing at the side was also very concerned about this. The two clans had been fighting against the Xiao Clan for a very long time. They were very clear on what Xiao Xiong was like. When they heard that Xiao Xiong was now a Martial king, they felt fear in their hearts.When Leng Zhengyun heard this, he smiled indifferently, \u201cBrother Tang, you don\u2019t have to worry. Xiao Xiong has indeed come out of his isolation, but his cultivation is only at peak Martial Saint. His Martial Spirit is a wind attributed Martial Spirit, thus he was able to fly.\u201d\u201cIn another three days, the final Martial Saint elder of my Leng Clan will be leading fifty Martial Grand Masters over in case anything happens. However, I hope that we will not need to utilize this force. It is best if your two clans can defeat the Xiao Clan in the Promise of Ten Years. That would save us a lot of trouble.\u201dWhen the two clan heads heard this, they breathed out in relief. Then, Tang Tian suddenly remembered something, \u201cI heard earlier that Xiao Chen was not injured. If this is so, then according to the rules of the competition, our two clans do not stand much of an advantage.\u201dAccording to the rules of the Promise of Ten Years, the Xiao Clan, Zhang Clan, and Tang Clan would have to select three participants beforehand. On the day of the competition, one of the two Clans must challenge the Xiao Clan. The victor of this battle then battles against the final clan. The final victor receives the rights to Seven Horn Mountain.Tang Tian said, \u201cWith Xiao Chen\u2019s strength, even when going one against three, we might not win. The result is still unpredictable, especially after letting him rest for a day before battling the other clan.The Zhang Clan Head stood beside and nodded his head in agreement. When Leng Zeyu heard this, he had an unnatural expression on his face. Now that there was such a situation, the responsibilities all fell onto him.Leng Zhengyun\u2019s expression did not change as he said indifferently, \u201cThat is not a problem. I will think of something when the time comes. Even if we lose, there is still our final move. I just hope we don\u2019t have to resort to that.\u201d\u2026The next day, Within the Great Hall of the Xiao Clan:Before the morning dew evaporated, the elders of the Xiao Clan all gathered in the great hall.The Xiao Clan head, Xiao Xiong, sat on a chair in the middle. He said to Xiao Qiang beside him, \u201cFirst Elder, what do you think of our current situation?\u201dXiao Qiang immediately replied, \u201cThe situation now is very clear. The Leng Clan is working with the Zhang Clan and Tang Clan against us. Without any external assistance, cannot resolve this.\u201dThe few others beside also agreed with this. Without any external assistance, not only would the Xiao Clan lose the Seven Horn Mountain, it would be difficult for the Xiao Clan to even survive.Xiao Qiang continued, \u201cActually, Miss Feng is currently in Mohe City. A few days ago, she came by the Xiao Clan to visit.\u201dWhen Xiao Xiong heard about Feng Feixue, the expression on his face instantly turned incredibly scary. He said in a sullen voice, \u201cWhat is she doing here? Did that aunt of hers tell her to come here and see our sorry state?\u201dXiao Qiang quickly explained everything that had happened that day. After Xiao Xiong heard this he said, \u201cI will not interfere with their choice, but it is impossible for me to seek help from the Feng Clan. Call for someone to send Xiao Chen over.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 82:\u00a0Promise of Ten YearsBy the time Xiao Chen woke up, the sun was high in the sky and it was already noon.\u201cI forced myself too much. I estimate that I am going to need three days of rest in order to fully recover. I have exhausted too much of my blood essence,\u201d Xiao Chen got up and massaged his Taiyang Acupoint as he headed toward the gates of the Xiao Residence.[TL notes: The Taiyang Acupoint is at the side of the forehead.]When the two guards watching the gates saw Xiao Chen appear, they immediately ran over saying joyfully, \u201cSecond Young Master, you finally returned. The Clan head has been looking for you the whole morning. You better go to the great hall quickly.\u201dXiao Chen was startled,\u00a0They were looking for him for the whole morning... There must be something urgent.\u00a0After saying his thanks, he rushed over to the great hall.At this moment, most of the people had already gone, leaving only Xiao Qiang and Xiao Xiong behind. Xiao Chen immediately rushed over and said, \u201cMy apologies. I\u2019m late.\u201dXiao Xiong looked at Xiao Chen with doubt in his eyes, and asked, \u201cWhy is your complexion so poor? Where did you go, and what did you do last night? I heard that you were in Yulan\u2019s room, and only came out very late.\u201dXiao Qiang, who was standing beside him, looked at Xiao Chen with a stunned face. It was obvious he wanted an answer too. Xiao Chen\u2019s current appearance looked as though he had performed a certain act. Furthermore, with his previous reputation, it was difficult for people to not think of that.Xiao Chen felt ashamed in his heart and hurriedly explained, \u201cFirst Elder, please do not misunderstand. Last night, after chatting with Yulan, I left immediately. The reason why my complexion is so poor is because something went wrong with my cultivation.\u201d\u201cNever mind. That is not important. The reason why I called you here was to discuss the matter of the Promise of Ten Years\u2019 duels.\u201d Xiao Xiong saw that Xiao Chen wanted to continue to explain himself, thus, he interrupted him.Seeing the First Elder\u2019s expression, Xiao Chen really wanted to explain in detail the events of the previous night. However, since Xiao Xiong said that, he did not dare to carry on explaining.Xiao Xiong continued, \u201cYou should be familiar with the rules of the Promise of Ten Years\u2019 duels. The participants that were selected can no longer be changed. Xiao Jian and Xiao Yulan are unable to participate in the duels. If this is too much pressure for you, I will not force you to do this.\u201d\u201cI am not just saying some words of formalities. Even if we lose Seven Horn Mountain, we can still get it back in the future. I hope you will consider carefully before you give me an answer. After all, you are my son,\u201d Xiao Xiong\u2019s words were sincere, and did not contain any hypocrisy.Xiao Chen considered in his heart for awhile before saying, \u201cI will not give up. Regardless of the situation, I must make an attempt.\u201dHe had already made his decision in his heart. Regardless of the results of the Promise of Ten Years, he was planning to leave the Xiao Clan. if he left the Xiao Clan without doing anything, he would not feel at peace in his heart.Xiao Xiong looked at Xiao Chen with a profound gaze before slowly saying, \u201cCome with me. First Elder, please come along as well. It is time we used the wealth that the Xiao Clan has accumulated in the past few hundred years.\u201dXiao Qiang\u2019s heart trembled. He knew where they were going. The expression on his face turned solemn and respectful.Xiao Chen followed the two of them, and travelled for quite a distance. Along the way, they used secret passages that were hidden behind objects and obstacles.Xiao Chen had even been to some of these places before. He just never discovered the secret passages. It was a completely different world behind them. Finally, the two people in front stopped before the doors to an underground room.Xiao Qiang and Xiao Xiong each took out a key part and combined them together to form a single key. They used this key to open the door to the underground room. Then, Xiao Chen followed both of them inside.The underground room was actually a secret treasury. The harvests that the Xiao Clan obtained over the past hundreds of years were all stored here. There were Spirit Weapons, Secret Treasures, Battle Armors, Medicinal Pills, Martial Techniques... Everything that was needed could be found here.Xiao Chen was shocked in his heart, he had not expected there to be such a large treasury underneath the Xiao Residence. The Spirit Weapons here were all Profound Ranked, the highest of which was Superior Grade. There were also many profound Ranked Martial Techniques, as well as many Grade 4 and Grade 5 Medicinal Pills.However, Xiao Chen possessed the Lunar Shadow Saber ( considered to be a heavenly weapon), the Wooden Carving that was comparable to a high grade Secret Treasure, and the Martial Technique inheritance of the Thunder Emperor. To the other members of the Xiao Clan, the items in the treasury would cause them to go wild with joy. However, Xiao Chen was not very interested in them.Xiao Xiong picked up a set of Battle Armor and said, \u201cAs for Martial Techniques and Spirit Weapons, you should not be lacking. This Profound Ranked Battle Armor is made from the soft skin of a Demonic Beast\u2019s abdomen. In times of danger, this could save your life.\u201dXiao Chen took the Battle Armor and looked it over. This Battle Armor was extremely thin; it was only a little thicker than normal clothing, and it would not hinder his movements when worn.This is a pretty good item,\u00a0Xiao Chen thought joyfully in his heart. It was difficult to purchase this kind of Battle Armor in the market, and it was also something that Xiao Chen needed.\u201cAlright, as for the other thing, they would probably not catch your attention,\u201d Xiao Xiong paused for a while, looking at Xiao Chen before continuing, \u201cJust simply choose a few items. Consider them your compensation.\u201dXiao Chen did not reject, and casually selected a few items. After he wore the Battle Armor on his body, he left the place.Six days of time went by quickly, and the duels of the Promise of Ten Years were finally officially starting.In the past six days, Xiao Chen researched the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique. Most of his current Martial Techniques were learned as a result of the Battle Sage Origin\u2019s Changing Character Formula. It was difficult for him to comprehend the essence behind them.However, he had the complete manual of the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique. Of course, he had to do his best to learn everything within it with the remaining time available, especially the Rushing Thunder Third Chain Chop; its might was close to that of an Earth Ranked Martial Technique.Just as the sky turned bright, Xiao Chen quickly got up. The Xiao Clan\u2019s people were already gathered at the entrance.\u00a0When Xiao Xiong saw that Xiao Chen arrived, he immediately brought the group to depart for Cultivator's Plaza.The annual Martial Competition of Mohe City had already started three days ago. However, everyone knew that the true highlight was the Promise of Ten Years, the battle of Mohe City\u2019s three great clan.There was a huge crowd in the plaza, and the people of the three great clans moved closely to each other as they made their way through the crowds. On the platform in the plaza three pavilions were constructed specially for the three great clans; they were able to see the entire plaza from it.\u201cThe Xiao Clan\u2019s people are here. Wasn\u2019t it said that two of their participants were injured and cannot participate? Why do they still dare to show their faces here?\u201d\u201cLook at the dark expressions on their faces. Looks like the news of two of their participants being injured is true. Are they just here to try their luck?\u201d\u201cYou know what? Xiao Chen is not injured, so the Xiao Clan still has hope.\u201d\u201cXiao Chen? No matter how strong he is, he is not able to stand against the tactic of several persons taking turns in fighting him to tire him out. I think the Xiao Clan is bound to lose.\u201dThe varied discussions of the crowd all entered into the ears of the Xiao Clan\u2019s people, causing their dark expression to turn even more sullen.\u201cBrother Xiao, it\u2019s been a long time. You finally came out of isolation!\u201d Just as the Xiao Clan\u2019s people were about to ascend to their pavilion, the Zhang Clan Head and Tang Clan Head walked over.Xiao Xiong smiled indifferently, \u201cIndeed, it\u2019s been a long time. Tang Tian, the alliance of the Zhang Clan and the Leng Clan was within my expectations. I did not expect that you would be involved as well.\u201dTang Tian smiled coldly, \u201cWe can\u2019t let Seven Horn Mountain remain monopolized by an outsider clan.\u201dThe Zhang Clan Head opened his mouth to speak, \u201cXiao Xiong, we are not here for a casual chit chat. We are here to discuss something with you. We have a suggestion for you to consider.\u201d\u201cHow about we resolve the hundreds of years of grudges between our clans? As long as Xiao Chen can defeat Tang Feng and Zhang He today, then the remaining four people will not come out to battle. We will consider it as the Xiao Clan\u2019s victory.\u201dXiao Xiong\u2019s brain worked very hard as he thought about this. The Zhang Clan Head meant that he would send only two people to battle with Xiao Chen, but the condition was that both the battles had to occur today.Their intentions were clear. They wanted to use the tactics of exhausting Xiao Chen, to not give him the opportunity to rest. However, this meant that he could fight four battles less.When Xiao Chen heard this suggestion, his eyes brightened and joy filled his heart. He did not have many Martial Techniques, and if he were to fight too many battles it would become apparent to his opponents. This fit Xiao Chen\u2019s intentions perfectly.Seeing Xiao Chen nodding his head in the dark, Xiao Xiong said, \u201cWhat a joke! You think that I would agree to this? After getting the Leng Clan to injure our Xiao Clan\u2019s participants, you come up and give me such a suggestion? Do you think that I, Xiao Xiong, am a fool?\u201dTang Tian smiled, \u201cXiao Xiong, do you think you have any other choice? This is the best scenario for you already. From six battles being reduced to two battles, I don\u2019t see any need for you to reject this.\u201dThe Zhang Clan head said, \u201cBrother Xiao, I have already sent for someone to call the City Lord over, so think about this carefully.\u201dAfter a few moments, Dugu Feng arrived, and when he saw Xiao Xiong he hurriedly said, \u201cCongratulations Brother Xiao on coming out from your secluded training. I heard that two of your participants are injured, is this true?\u201dWithout waiting for Xiao Xiong to reply, Tang Tian put forth his suggestion to Dugu Feng. After Dugu Feng heard the suggestion, he muttered to Xiao Xiong, \u201cAccording to the rules of the competition, once the participants are selected they cannot be changed. Xiao Xiong, if two of your participants truly cannot participate, how about you accept this suggestion?\u201dFinally, under Dugu Feng\u2019s suggestion, Xiao Xiong was \u2018pressured\u2019 into accepting this suggestion. Xiao Chen, who was standing at the stand, wiped the sweat off his forehead. The acting skills of Xiao Xiong were too realistic, even he was almost fooled.Dugu Feng stood on the top of the tallest arena in Cultivator's Plaza. Facing the crowd he said, \u201cToday is the final day of the Martial Competition. I believe that most of you are here for the competition of the Promise of Ten Years. Now, I would like to announce something.\u201d\u201cBecause two of the Xiao Clan\u2019s participants were injured and cannot take part in the competition, after some discussion, the three clans decided to change the rules at the last minute. As long as Xiao Chen of the Xiao Clan can consecutively defeat Zhang He and Tang Feng, the Xiao Clan will be considered to have won the duels. As long as they lose just one of the matches, they will lose their rights to Seven Horn Mountain.\u201d\u201cTo think that the news of two participants of the Xiao Clan being unable to participate is true,\u201d someone below said in shock.\u201cHaha, this alteration may seem advantageous to the Xiao Clan, but actually they are planning to use the tactic of tiring out Xiao Chen. Looks like the Tang Clan and Zhang Clan have formed an alliance.\u201d\u201cIndeed, I heard that the Xiao Clan suffered from the attack of some experts in the middle of the night. I suspect that the two clans were the culprits behind that.\u201d\u201cHow stupid are you? Why is there even a need to suspect it? There is no need to think about it; it was definitely done by the two clans.\u201dEndless discussions and arguments entered into Xiao Chen\u2019s ears, but his heart remained as calm as still water as he slowly walked past the crowd and headed towards the arena. The shadow of the Tianwu Emperor statue was cast over the arena, giving the arena an additional solemn feel.I have to win today\u2019s battle. I will not become a stepping stone for others. After ten thousand years, I will be like the Tianwu Emperor, standing tall and towering over others without falling,\u00a0Xiao Chen muttered to himself in his heart.When he neared the arena, Xiao Chen pushed off gently with his feet and landed stably on the arena. As he did this, his eyes were resolute. In the other corner, Zhang He had been waiting for a while. His gaze was cold.The first battle of the Promise of Ten Years officially begins!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His Martial Spirit not only recovered, but it became even stronger.\u201d\u201cI wonder if he can defeat Xiao Chen this time? It could be said that they were evenly matched the last time.\u201d\u201cIf Zhang He\u2019s Martial Spirit is destroyed again, I wonder if it is possible to save it again.\u201d\u201cYou guys don't understand. After a Martial Spirit recondenses, its might and strength is increased by many times. To think that the Zhang Clan was able to obtain a Returning Essence Pill. I wonder how they did it?\u201dBefore the two of them started fighting, the sounds of discussions coming from the crowd could be heard. The referee walked up and told the two of them, \u201cExchange salutations.\u201dXiao Chen and Zhang He exchanged salutations, \u201cDuel, Start!\u201d\u201cZhi!\u201dRight after the referee said those words, Zhang He immediately executed Heavenly Roc Spreading Wings Movement Technique. An illusion of a heavenly roc appeared behind him, giving off a loud bird cry,He flew off the ground and hovered in the air. Zhang He brandished his sword in his hands and four streams of sword Qi screamed in the air, heading towards Xiao Chen.Xiao Chen\u2019s eyes were calm as a gentle breeze blows his fine black hair and clothes fluttered in the wind. He made poking motions in the air four times, and four streams of purple flames appeared on his finger tips; the flames revolved around his fingers once and then flew towards the sword Qi.\u201cBoom! Boom! Boom! Boom!\u201dThe sword Qi and the purple flames clashed in the air, giving off four explosive sounds before dissipating in all directions. Zhang He casually waved his hand and sent out a Qi wave, scattering the flames in front of him.The Heavenly Roc Spreading Wings Movement Technique was extremely fast; Zhang he was able to instantly move to the front of Xiao Chen. Xiao Chen was barely able to see Zhang He\u2019s figure moving. Actually, Xiao Chen did not have any decent Movement Techniques.\u201cZhi!\u201dThere was another loud bird cry. When Zhang He was near Xiao Chen, his body moved strangely to one side, leaving behind an afterimage. As a matter of fact, Zhang He was already behind Xiao Chen.Xiao Chen closed his eyes and sent out his Spiritual Sense. A gentle breeze blew as Xiao Chen\u2019s feet remained steady and unmoving. Suddenly, the Lunar Shadow Saber burst out in light and with a flick of his wrist, the Lunar Shadow Saber moved towards the back and blocked.\u201cBang!\u201dXiao Chen\u2019s saber managed to intercept Zhang He\u2019s slash as it came from behind him. It was very precise, in the eyes of others, as though he had grown eyes on the back of his head.Zhang He was mildly astonished, but he still remained in the air. Moving very nimbly, he switched to another position and arrived to the back of Xiao Chen\u2019s left side.Suddenly, Xiao Chen\u2019s Lunar Shadow Saber was switched to his left hand and before Zhang He could make his move, a resplendent glow appeared on the Saber blade and chopped towards Zhang He; Xiao Chen\u2019s feet still had not changed position.Zhang he was shocked, he could attribute the earlier block as a coincidence. However, with Xiao Chen taking the initiative, it was clear that Xiao Chen was able to see the attacks coming from behind him.Spreading apart both his hands like a huge bird, Zhang He retreated into the air. As he was about to land on the ground after making a somersault, the tip of his sword came in contact with the ground and gently sprung back into the air.\u201cHu!\u201dHe executed the Heavenly Roc Spreading Wings Movement Technique to the extreme, moving through the air like a sharp arrow, shooting towards Xiao Chen; the tip of his sword surging toward him.\u201cDang! Dang! Dang! Dang!\u201dIn an instant, the two of them exchanged countless blows. Despite Zhang He executing the Heavenly Roc Spreading Wings Movement Technique to the extreme, Xiao Chen still did not move. He dealt with every blow as they came, and was not flustered at all.After Zhang He stabbed out with his sword again, he flew backward. Seeing that Xiao Chen still had his eyes closed, he felt very helpless in his heart. The Movement Technique that he was so proud of, was actually useless against Xiao Chen.In the previous battle, Xiao Chen was not able to catch up to his speed; he was only able to use the Heavenly Lightning Shield and passively defend. Now, he was able to hold his ground without moving and deal with Zhang He\u2019s moves.\u201cFlight On Wings, One Line Chop!\u201dZhang He shouted angrily, as a simple and reserved sword move chopped down towards Xiao Chen. Since he was not able to use speed to suppress Xiao Chen, then he would use force to do so.Suddenly, Xiao Chen opened his eyes. A gleam flashed in them as he watched Zhang He descending from the sky. He smiled indistinctly and his feet pushed off the ground gently, leaping into the air.\u201cFlight On Wings, One Line Chop!\u201d\u201cBang!\u201dThe saber light and sword light collided with each other, giving off a horrifying Qi wave in the air. Zhang He retreated backward by several steps. Seeing that Xiao Chen only had his movements affected slightly, he was extremely astonished,\u00a0To think that I would actually lose to Xiao Chen in a competition of force.\u201cZhi!\u201dThe heavenly roc behind Zhang He cried out loudly again; Zhang He pulled to a stop in midair, cutting off the momentum of falling. He looked at Xiao Chen, who was in the air, and his grin faintly revealed derision.Even if you are slightly stronger than me, you should not go against me in the air. I have the Heavenly Roc Spreading Wings Movement Technique. Let\u2019s see how you will resist the\u00a0gravitational pull.\u201cFlight On Wings, Disordered Dance of a Thousand Years!\u201dZhang He shouted loudly and executed the Martial Technique he was so proud of against the falling Xiao Chen. He hoped to defeat Xiao Chen in the air and not give him the chance to land.Xiao Chen smiled faintly in his heart and a stream of energy came from the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit. He brandished his saber and did a somersault, his body using the energy from the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit to abruptly rise higher.Zhang He\u2019s Martial Technique immediately lost its target. Zhang He raised his head to discover that Xiao Chen was already above him; Zhang He was startled.\u201cFlight On Wings, Disordered Dance of a Thousand Years!\u201dAlthough it was the same Disordered Dance of a Thousand Years, when compared against Zhang He\u2019s Disordered Dance of a Thousand Years, Xiao Chen had the advantage of position. The Disordered Dance of a Thousand Years executed from above him completely\u00a0suppressed\u00a0Zhang He.In an instant, the figures of the two of them kept changing position. Countless saber lights and sword lights flew around. The sounds of the sword lights and saber lights clashing with each other rang out incessantly. Within an instant, they had exchanged hundreds of blows.\u201cWith the difference in their positions, Zhang He is going to be at a huge disadvantage. Surprisingly, Xiao Chen had a Movement Technique that allowed him to rise higher into the air.\u201d\u201cIndeed, he possibly had revealed an \u2018opening\u2019 on purpose. Or else, why would he suddenly decide to battle him in the air?\u201d\u201cIt is very possible.\u201dAs the crowd discussed the fight, the people of the three great clans were also anxiously watching the fight below.In the Xiao Clan\u2019s pavilion, Xiao Yulan was watching the two people in the air very apprehensively, her eyes filled with worry. After they executed the Disordered Dance of a Thousand Years, they moved very fast. With Xiao Yulan\u2019s current cultivation level, it was difficult for her to see the situation clearly.\u201cFather, how is the situation?\u201d Xiao Yulan asked the First Elder.[TL notes: Not sure if I mentioned this before, but in the past, the author said that the first elder was her grandfather. After a while it seems that he became the father instead. I will use father from now on, and will change the previous chapters to father to keep things consistent.]Xiao Qiang smiled faintly, \u201cAll\u2019s good. Xiao Chen has the advantage.\u201dThe people of the Zhang Clan and Tang Clan were both in the same pavilion. The Zhang Clan Head had an unsightly expression on his face, \u201cTo think that he fell for such a simple trap. Zhang He is too shortsighted.\u201dTang Tian consoled him, \u201cHe only lost the advantage temporarily. It has not reached the moment where victory will be decided. Furthermore, this way, we can expose one of Xiao Chen\u2019s skills.\u201dTang Feng, who was standing beside them, grasped the Ice Fire Bow tightly as he stared at the two people in the sky. He smiled coldly, \u201cThis kind of skill will only become a sitting duck in front of my Ice Fire Bow.\u201d\u201cBang!\u201dWithin a short moment, the two people in the sky exchanged more than 1200 moves with each other. As they finished up the Martial Technique, Xiao Chen ruthlessly planted his foot onto Zhang He\u2019s body, pushing off with some force and causing him Xiao Chen to soar higher into the sky.Zhang He fell onto the ground with a \u2018bang\u2019. There were many holes on his shirt created by saber lights, leaving behind many bloody wounds. He looked at Xiao Chen, who was soaring higher into the sky, and his eyes were full of shock.What was he trying to do?Zhang He quickly got up and cast aside the doubts in his heart. Currently, his momentum was at rock bottom. If he could not regain any of it, he would be thoroughly suppressed by Xiao Chen.\u201cHeavenly Roc Spreading Wings, Chasing Stars Catching Moon!\u201dThe illusion behind Zhang He\u2019s back suddenly let out a sharp bird cry. His clothes fluttered around non-stop as a sound-wave burst out in all directions.The spectators who were closer to the arena instantly felt their eardrums tremble, making them feel dizzy. The people with lower cultivations even vomited blood and fainted.\u201cThis bird cry has already achieved the charm of a divine bird cry. To think that Zhang He still has so many cards to play, even after being injured.\u201d\u201cBack in the days of\u00a0that expert, he used the divine bird cry to cause people to bleed from their seven orifices and to die from the rupturing of their internal organs. Although Zhang He has not reached such a level yet, it is already pretty good for him to be able to make people faint,\u201d the crowds below discussed.After Zhang He used the Chasing Stars Catching Moon Movement Technique, he was like a sharp arrow fired from a bow. He sprang up from the ground and chased after Xiao Chen. Despite making his move later, he managed to catch up with Xiao Chen in an instant.Xiao Chen frowned slightly; he was astonished at the Heavenly Roc Spreading Wings Movement Technique. With Zhang He\u2019s current cultivation level, he was able to reach such a standard. One could only imagine the might and strength of that expert from back then.Xiao Chen had no other choice but to give up on his original plan. He originally wanted to use the Meteor Burst; if Zhang He had been late in catching up to him, he was confident that he could have used the Meteor Burst and ended this duel instantly.Xiao Chen twisted his body and avoided a stream of sword Qi that Zhang he sent out. He quickly descended towards the ground. His Movement Technique was not as good as Zhang He\u2019s; there were no advantages to going against him in the air.Seeing the statue of the Tianwu Emperor in front of him, Xiao Chen\u2019s eyes brightened. Xiao Chen moved quickly in the air and avoided the sword Qi of Zhang He as he descended towards the statue of the Tianwu Emperor.After a few moments, Xiao Chen stood on the sword of the Tianwu Emperor. After he stabilized himself, Xiao Chen finally had the opportunity to make a counter attack. He turned around to face Zhang He, who was chasing him, as he shot out four Grade 3 Flame Talismans.Zhang He made stepping motions in the air, and the image of a heavenly roc appeared; the image of the heavenly roc looked very real. Zhang He stood on it and moved towards the left, evading a talisman that was shot at him.\u201cBang!\u201dJust as Zhang he thought that everything was fine, the talisman suddenly exploded in the air. Surging heat waves emanated in all directions, with the talisman as the center.\u201cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u201dThere were another three explosive sounds as the other three talismans exploded continuously, filling the sky with thick flames. A boundless heat wave blasted out in all directions. Similar to dark clouds, it covered up the bright sun, looking like a large cloud made of flames.Seeing the thick clouds filling up the sky, the crowd below were all astonished. The Zhang Clan Head was frightened until his face could show no expression. He trembled as he said, \u201cIs this a Secret Treasure? The Xiao Clan actually still has such a Secret Treasure...\u201dTang Tian and his son, who were at the side, were also incomparably shocked. The thick flames actually covered the entire sky above the arena; the blaze had a matchless might and power. Even from far away, they could feel the horrifying heatwave.\u201cClear Sky Holy Sword, Eight Desolate Sweeps!\u201dJust as the crowd thought that the situation was very bad for Zhang He, a resplendent sword light suddenly appeared in the sky, scattering away the thick flames completely. The sunlight from above shone down on them once again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sword Zhang He grasped in his hand gave off a resplendent sword light. The heavenly roc that suddenly appeared below his feet actually allowed him to float, temporarily.The aura of the Clear Sky Holy Sword Martial Spirit kept rising. A boundless sword intent appeared in his eyes. When Xiao Chen looked into Zhang He\u2019s eyes, he actually saw the scene of an ancient battlefield;\u00a0he was nearly entranced in it before he quickly recalled his wits.Zhang He looked at Xiao Chen, who was standing on the sword tip of the Tianwu Emperor\u2019s sword, \u201cXiao Chen, actually, I have to thank you. If you had not shattered my Martial Spirit, my understanding of the clear sky would not have advanced by another level.\u201dXiao Chen held onto the Lunar Shadow Saber as he stood stably on the sword residing in the hand of the Tianwu Emperor\u2019s statue. Smiling faintly, he said, \u201cI thought you were about to thank me for the few new hairstyles that I\u2019ve given you. Why are you wearing a hat? I feel that your current hairstyle is very nice. There is no need to cover it up.\u201dZhang He felt anger burning, and the sword intent in his eyes started to slowly dissipate. Just when the sword intent was almost completely gone, he felt that something was wrong and hurriedly closed his eyes.When he opened his eyes again, the boundless sword intent appeared again; his state of mind had returned to its previous calm. He looked at Xiao Chen indifferently and said, \u201cNot bad. At this moment, you are able to use words to break my sword intent. You are indeed a good opponent.\u201d\u201cHowever, no matter how strong you are, you will eventually only be a stepping stone to my Dao of becoming a Sword Sage. For I have completely comprehended the Clear Sky Sword Intent.\u201dAlthough Xiao Chen felt it was a pity that Zhang He managed to quickly recover his sword intent, he also felt disdain for Zhang He. He was able to break his Sword Intent just by using a few words, and yet Zhang He still dared to brag about completely comprehending the Clear Sky Sword Intent.\u201cHu!\u201dZhang He rode on the heavenly roc and flew over. Xiao Chen pushed off with his feet gently and leaped up into the air, avoiding Zhang He\u2019s attack. However, he discovered that Zhang He\u2019s attack was just a feint.Zhang He rushed to the head of the Tianwu Emperor, and the heavenly roc beneath his feet disappeared. He landed with a \u2018bang\u2019 sound and a relieved expression appeared on his face.So he had exhausted too much of his Essence and needed to find a place to land,\u00a0Xiao Chen mocked him in his heart.\u201cFlight On Wings, Moon Bright Like Fire.\u201dZhang He stood on the head of the Tianwu Emperor statue and immediately executed the third move of Flight On Wings. A mysterious phenomenon occurred. The sky, which previously had a sun shining fiercely in it, was now covered by the darkness of night and a full moon slowly rose into the sky.Suddenly, two human figures flew in from the horizon. One was male and the other was female; they were holding swords and appeared to be \u2018deities\u2019. They looked very elegant and graceful, as they held their swords and danced under the moonlight.Xiao Chen was shocked in his heart,\u00a0Why were there two people now? The last time Zhang He executed that Moon Bright Like Fire, there was only one human figure. To think that it actually turned into two people now.\u201cThe Clear Sky Sword Intent is indeed formidable. To think that Zhang He was able to comprehend the true essence of Flight On Wings so quickly.\u201d\u201cIndeed. Legend has it that the Sword Sage who created the Flight On Wings created it because of his longing for his dead wife.\u201d\u201cI wonder how strong the might of Moon Bright Like Fire will be this time? The might it showed previously was already quite horrifying.\u201d\u201cThis is only the third move of Flight On Wings. Given that he comprehended it to this level, its might should be equivalent to the level of an Earth Ranked Martial Technique.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see how Xiao Chen will defend himself from the might of an Earth Ranked Martial Technique this time. If Zhang He can completely bring out the might of this technique, he could even kill a Martial Grand Master easily.\u201dThere were many knowledgeable people below the arena discussing this. When the Zhang Clan and Tang Clan in the pavilion saw that Zhang He was able to execute the Flight On Wings to this level, their expressions slowly became relaxed.However, the expressions of the people in the Xiao Clan\u2019s pavilion turned grim. Xiao Yulan asked worriedly, \u201cWhat is going on? Why does that person\u2019s Martial Technique have such a strange mysterious phenomenon. Will Cousin Xiao Chen be all right?\u201dXiao Xiong stared at the full moon that hung high in the sky, as well as the human figures that flew over. After a while, he sighed, \u00a0\u201cThe appearance of the mysterious phenomenon has nothing to do with the cultivation realm. It is completely reliant on the understanding of the Dao of the Sword. I believe that amongst the younger generation of Qizi County, no one can surpass this brat from the Zhang Clan in terms of understanding the Dao of the sword.\u201dXiao Chen stood on the sword tip as his Spiritual Sense extended towards the full moon in the sky. However, that moon seemed as though it was really in the sky. No matter how hard he extended his Spiritual Sense, he was unable to reach it.Suddenly, the two human figures stopped moving in the sky and the sky immediately quieted. Xiao Chen felt as though he was being locked down by two strong Sword Intents. He could feel a dangerous sensation.\u201cKill!\u201dZhang He raised his sword and pointed it at Xiao Chen. A boundless Sword Intent surged over.A heavy rumble rose in the air.Feeling Zhang He\u2019s killing intent, the two figures pointed their swords towards the sky and gave off two streams of resplendent sword light. After that, the two streams of sword light merged together and chopped downwards towards Xiao Chen.Seeing the very powerful sword light, the people below the arena quickly fled in all directions. If this sword light chopped down like that, then there would be plenty of people who would be injured.\u201cShua!\u201dXiao Chen threw a wooden sculpture, which appeared in his hand, into the sky. The wooden sculpture instantly turned into a girl holding a golden spear.\u201cBoundless Azure Sea!\u201dA boundless sea appeared behind Yue Ying; an azure dragon leaped out from the sea. The golden spear trembled as the azure dragon roared angrily and rushed towards the sword light in the sky.\u201cBoom!\u201dThere was a loud startling sound. The sword light was instantly dispersed by the azure dragon. The azure dragon roared angrily again, and continued to rush forward, clashing against the boundless \u2018night sky\u2019.\u201cChi!\u201dA hole immediately appeared in the \u2018night sky\u2019 and a column of sunlight shone in from the hole. The hole grew larger and larger, and after a few short moments the sunlight was shining on the ground once again. The full moon and human figures completely vanished.Xiao Chen casually waved his hands and the wooden sculpture returned to his hand. He felt extremely unfortunate; he could only use it one more time.The \u2018night sky\u2019 disappeared and Zhang He vomited a mouthful of blood. His expression showed incredible weakness as he knelt on one knee on the head of the Tianwu Emperor.\u201cIt\u2019s finished. Zhang He\u2019s mysterious phenomenon was broken. He is now unable to turn this around after suffering the backlash,\u201d the people below the arena exclaimed.Xiao Chen leaped lightly onto the head of the Tianwu Emperor, and ruthlessly kicked Zhang He off towards the ground without bothering to engage him in useless chatter.The statue of the Tianwu Emperor was hundreds of meters tall. If Zhang He fell from it, he would be severely injured, even if he did not die. The Zhang Clan Head shouted out in surprise as he leaped out from the pavilion, intending to catch Zhang He.However, Xiao Chen did not wish to give him the opportunity to do so. Leaping down, he kicked Zhang He\u2019s chest heavily again. Zhang He cried out painfully as he vomited out another mouthful of blood.The huge force caused Zhang He to crash onto the body of the Zhang Clan Head. Thus, the two fell towards the ground. As they were about the hit the ground, the Zhang Clan Head did a somersault and landed firmly on the ground. However, Zhang He landed heavily on the ground with a loud bang and died.The Zhang Clan Head\u2019s complexion was ashen as he looked at the dead Zhang He. Xiao Chen\u2019s kick was too ruthless. He kicked him at the Dantian, crippling Zhang He\u2019s Martial Spirit.The Zhang Clan Head pointed a trembling finger at Xiao Chen and said lividly, \u201cXiao Chen! To think that you are so ruthless! You\u2026\u201d Towards the end, he was so angry that he could not say anything else.Xiao Chen smiled coldly, \u201cI am ruthless? Am I as ruthless as you? Allying with the Leng Clan and murdering more than a hundred people from my Xiao Clan. Should I show mercy to Zhang He so that he can come and hurt my family and friends in the future?\u201dShifting his gaze to the referee at the side, Xiao Chen continued, \u201cYou are able to declare the victory already, right?\u201dThat referee was stunned for a moment before coming back to his senses, \u201cThe Xiao Clan won this round. Would the Tang Clan participant please step up to the arena?\u201d\u201cTo think that Xiao Chen was actually able to defeat Zhang He with ease... How unimaginable.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, unimaginable? His final move was clearly a Secret Treasure. It is not him who defeated Zhang He, it was his Secret Treasure.\u201d\u201cA defeat is a defeat. Why look for excuses?\u00a0Could it be that Secret Treasures are not part of one\u2019s strength? Of the ten experts in the nation with the abilities to suppress the entire nation, there is one who relies on a Secret Treasure. Even so, there is no one who dares to speak out against him.\u201dMany people felt that it was incredulous that Xiao Chen was able to defeat Zhang He so easily. No one expected that Xiao Chen had a Secret Treasure that was so powerful.Looking at Xiao Chen, Tang Tian frowned deeply. He said to Tang Feng, \u201cI\u2019m afraid he did not exhaust even half his Essence. If you find that the situation is disadvantageous for you, then immediately admit defeat.\u00a0\u2018While the green hills last, there'll be wood to burn.\u2019\u00a0Do not be like Zhang He. The Returning Essence Pill is not easy to obtain.[TL note: \u2018While the green hills last, there'll be wood to burn\u2019, this is a Chinese idiom for \u2018Where there's life, there's hope.]Tang Feng nodded his head. He grasped the Ice Fire Bow tightly as he leaped off the pavilion directly. After that, he landed firmly on the arena. When he landed on the arena, there was no sound at all; it was clear that he had an extremely brilliant Movement Technique.\u201cI have never heard of this Tang Feng before. I wonder how strong he is?\u201d\u201cI believe he will not last even five minutes. Looks like the Xiao Clan is going to win again.\u201d\u201cIndeed. Zhang He was not able to win, even with his strength. If they are going to rely on this unheard of person, they will not stand a chance.\u201dAll these years, the people of the Tang Clan were very low key. Aside from scarce rumors, no one knew about his true strength.Xiao Chen and Tang Feng\u2019s expressions did not change when they heard the discussions coming from below. However, Xiao Chen did not let his guard down. Instead, he raised it.In Gloomy Forest, Tang Feng only fired three arrows. Furthermore, he was hiding his strength. Even so, Xiao Chen defended against them with some difficulty. According to Xiao Chen\u2019s senses, Tang Feng was now a Martial Master, so his strength would have a qualitative increase.Under the instructions of the referee, the two of them exchanged salutations and the duel officially began.\u201cShua!\u201dXiao Chen did not hesitate as he stomped on the ground. His figure moved like lightning as he flew forward. When going against a long ranged opponent, naturally, one must get near and use short ranged attacks to deal a fatal blow.Xiao Chen was fast, but Tang Feng was faster. In the instant he started moving, Tang Feng shot three ice arrows.An electrical light was given off by the Lunar Shadow Saber. Xiao Chen generously fed his Essence into the saber as he chopped at the three ice arrows.\u201cBang! Bang! Bang!\u201dHe accurately chopped down thrice, hitting each ice arrow. The ice arrows disintegrated into fragments, but Xiao Chen's movements did not slow as he rushed at Tang Feng.Tang Feng calmly drew his bow and continuously fired out ice arrows. His footsteps had a strange pace to them; it was as though he was taking a stroll. It felt incredibly free and at ease.\u201cBang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\u201dXiao Chen chopped down on numerous ice arrows along the way, exhausting a large amount of Essence. After a tremendous amount of effort, he finally arrived where Tang Feng was initially standing. However, he discovered that his distance from Tang Feng was unchanged; he was still as far away as when they began.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xiao Chen smashed it to bits as well, as per his usual custom. Just as his saber touched the arrow, Xiao Chen felt something was wrong this time. This was not an ice arrow, but a fire arrow.\u201cBoom!\u201dBy the time Xiao Chen realized this, it was too late. The fire arrow exploded with a loud \u2018boom\u2019; an intense flame expanded fiercely in all directions.Xiao Chen used his Essence to cover the surface of his body, turning it into an Essence shield. Xiao Chen then quickly retreated backward, but he was too close to the source of the flames. The surging shockwaves generated by the explosion ruthlessly struck him.The powerful shockwaves knocked Xiao Chen flying backward. Xiao Chen was astonished; if he had not taken measures against it, this shockwave would be powerful enough to knock him out of the arena. The moment he landed outside the arena, he would automatically lose.\u201cChi!\u201dXiao Chen stuck the Lunar Shadow Saber into the Heavenly Mountain Stones, creating a long and large crack on the ground. This reduced the speed of his backward motion.After that, he somersaulted towards the back and then stood up again. Before Xiao Chen obtained a stable footing, two arrows made of flames arrived in front of him.Tang Feng, who was in the distance, plucked on his bowstring lightly. Before Xiao Chen could do anything, the two arrows made of flames exploded.\u201cBoom! Boom!\u201dBeing caught off guard, Xiao Chen had no time to put up an Essence Shield. He was immediately knocked flying by the terrifying, swelling heatwaves.The robes he wore grew tattered, and blood leaked from the corner of his mouth. Xiao Chen\u2019s body fell towards the ground outside the arena. The people below the arena quickly scattered.\u201cThis fellow concealed his strength. He actually has a dual attributed Martial Spirit. Furthermore, he is able to switch between ice and fire so quickly. His strength cannot be seen through.\u201d\u201cIndeed, no wonder Xiao Chen was caught off guard and got struck. The rarity of such a dual attributed Martial Spirit is comparable to the Spiritual Martial Spirits.\u201d\u201cIf Xiao Chen fell, would the duel end here?\u201dThe crowd in the distance discussed. No one expected Tang Feng to be so strong. It gave the crowd an unexpected surprise.Just as he was landing, Xiao Chen used the Lunar Shadow Saber to spring off the ground and flew back to the arena. However, there were another three flame arrows that welcomed him.Xiao Chen immediately expanded his Spiritual Sense and sent it into the core of the flame arrows. He found a\u00a0bright spot burning within the flame arrows, which was then imprinted on Xiao Chen\u2019s brain.So that\u2019s how it is,\u00a0Xiao Chen thought suddenly. He finally understood the reason why the flame arrows exploded. As long as he was able to destroy the light core in the flame arrows instantly, they would not be as terrifying.\u201cShua!\u201dXiao Chen brandished his Lunar Shadow Saber, and a saber light moved as fast as lightning through the air. In the next instant, the burning bright spot was shattered. The flame arrows were shattered with a loud sound, and turned into sparks, before fading into ashes.Indeed! That was how it was,\u00a0Xiao Chen smiled to himself,\u00a0It is time to use a killing move.Lightning Evasion!There was a flash of electricity, and suddenly, Xiao Chen appeared behind Tang Feng. The Lunar Shadow Saber was pointed towards his back as he chopped down ruthlessly. A boundless electrical light surrounded the saber blade as it caused a clap of thunder.Tang Feng was not surprised that Xiao Chen appeared suddenly; he already knew that Xiao Chen had this mysterious\u00a0\u2018Martial Technique\u2019. He turned his body slightly and avoided Xiao Chen\u2019s attack. Before Xiao Chen could recover for his move, he fiercely attacked Xiao Chen\u2019s chest from an inclined position.\u201cInclined Body Strike!\u201dThis was a Martial Technique that used the body as a blade. It focused one\u2019s Essence onto the shoulder and attacked the enemy like a lance. If one was struck by it, it could instantly cause one to be severely injured. This was a strong Martial Technique with an extremely high destructive power.Xiao Chen did not expect that Tang Feng had such strong combat abilities. He was caught off guard again, and was hit ruthlessly. The huge force penetrated through Xiao Chen\u2019s Battle Armor and was transmitted into his body. His internal organs were jolted.Using the recoil of this strike, Tang Feng\u2019s body flew rapidly towards the back. He pushed off the ground lightly, and his body pulled further away from Xiao Chen. While he was in the air, he already began drawing his bow.\u201cShua!\u201dAfter he landed, the ice arrow on the bow shot out with a \u2018shua\u2019 sound. The string of movements was very fluid; they were very natural and unforced.There was a cold gleam and the arrow instantly appeared in front of Xiao Chen. The blood and Qi in Xiao Chen\u2019s body was still churning. He was temporarily unable to use his Essence, and could only turn his body to evade.The arrow brushed by the side of Xiao Chen\u2019s face and flew behind him. The wind from the arrow caused a small, bloody wound on Xiao Chen\u2019s right cheek.Xiao Chen watched as ice arrows continuously flew at him. He felt very frustrated in his heart. This situation where he could only passively defend made him very sullen. After avoiding another arrow, Xiao Chen\u2019s left hand made a hand seal.A streak of lightning from the sky descended near Tang Feng. Tang Feng hurriedly stopped doing what he was doing and evaded toward the back. However, just as he stabilized himself, another five streaks of lightning crashed down loudly.With Xiao Chen\u2019s previous cultivation as a Martial Disciple, he could continuously send out three streaks of lightning. Now that he was a Martial Master, he could continuously send out\u00a0six\u00a0streaks of lightning.The six streaks of lightning gave Xiao Chen some buffer time. He used this time to ponder deeply on countermeasures against this situation. Xiao Chen felt he could only deal with this quickly by using close combat methods.He had to think of a way to get close. A wooden sculpture appeared in Xiao Chen\u2019s left hand. He sighed in his heart,\u00a0I can only sacrifice you.\u201cShua!\u201dXiao Chen threw the wooden sculpture at Tang Feng. A faint radiance expanded out from the wooden sculpture. A boundless dragon\u2019s might instantly filled the entire arena.Tang Feng\u2019s heart tightened; an arrow that was flickering with a spiritual light suddenly appeared in his hand. He\u00a0nocked\u00a0it to the bow quickly, and fired it at the wooden sculpture.The arrow was like a fierce tiger coming out; it gave off a prolonged hum in the air. The Essence in the air was infused into the arrow, causing it to turn incomparably resplendent.\u201cBoom!\u201dBefore Xiao Chen\u2019s wooden sculpture could be completely activated, the arrow flashed by gracefully and shattered it into countless pieces. Sawdust scattered everywhere, and Xiao Chen\u2019s trump card was gone, just like that.\u201cThat is the Essence Light Arrow from Heavenly Craft Manor. It is worth ten thousand gold. They only make a hundred of those every year. To think that the Tang Clan was able to obtain one.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that Xiao Chen\u2019s Secret Treasure was shattered just like that. That Secret Treasure managed to break Zhang He\u2019s mysterious phenomenon earlier... It must have been of a very high grade.\u201d\u201cThis is interesting now. I wonder if Xiao Chen still has other trump cards to play? If he does not, then it is very likely that he will be shot to death in a sorry manner.\u201d\u201cIndeed. A long ranged attacker, armed with exquisite Movement Techniques and excellent close combat skills. Within the same cultivation realm... He is practically unrivaled.\u201dThe situation on the arena changed once again, so the people below the arena discussed it once more. In the pavilion of the Tang Clan and Zhang Clan, the Zhang Clan Head asked out of amazement, \u201cBrother Tang, where did you obtain this Essence Light Arrow from? I heard that it is difficult to obtain, even for the Royal Family.\u201dTang Tian smiled faintly, \u201cHow could I have obtained it? It was given to Tang Feng by Leng Zhengyun last night. He gave him a total of three Essence Light Arrows.\u201dThe Zhang Clan Head revealed an elated expression, \u201cLet\u2019s see if Xiao Chen will continue to behave so savagely. Without a Secret Treasure, let\u2019s see how he is going to deal with the remaining two Essence Light Arrows.\u201dIn the pavilion where the Xiao Clan resided, after Xiao Qiang saw the Essence Light Arrow, his face was filled with a shocked expression, \u201cClan Head, I\u2019m afraid that we do not stand a chance anymore. How about we get Xiao Chen to give up?\u201dXiao Xiong's gaze was focused far away. He did not reply to Xiao Qiang\u2019s question and said, \u201cDid you notice the Movement Technique that Xiao Chen used to rise higher in the air in the previous battle?Xiao Qiang had a stunned expression for a while before exclaiming in surprise, \u201cYou mean to say, that is\u2026\u201d\u201cIndeed, that is the Azure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art,\u201d a complex expression appeared on Xiao Xiong\u2019s face. \u201cUnfortunately, this Movement Technique was lost long ago, or else he would not be in such a sorry state.\u201dXiao Xiong looked at Xiao Chen, who was in the arena. A warm look flashed in his eyes, and the image of a pretty girl appeared in his mind. He muttered to himself, \u201cIf it were not for that promise, you probably would not even be willing to enter the threshold of the Xiao Clan. Who exactly am I to you in your heart?\u201dThe First Elder, Xiao Qiang, carefully thought about the meaning of Xiao Xiong\u2019s words and deciphered it slowly before saying, \u201cClan Head, it has already been a thousand years. There is no need to be so worried. How about just letting go and gambling on it?\u201dXiao Xiong revealed a desolate expression. He smiled bitterly when he heard this, \u201cGamble? What am I going to gamble with? The lives of thousands of young and old of the Xiao Clan? I cannot afford that price, and neither do I dare to.\u201dXiao Qiang felt dissatisfied and wanted to say something more, \u201cClan Head, a thousand years have passed. This might be a chance\u2026\u201dXiao Xiong waved his hands and interrupted Xiao Qiang. He said indifferently, \u201cI\u2019m going to leave for a bit. If Xiao Chen\u2019s life is in danger, stop the duel immediately.\u201dAfter he said that, he leaped up high into the air and flew towards the Xiao Residence. His speed was very fast, and strings of explosions could be heard coming from the area near him. After a while he became a tiny black dot, disappearing from the people\u2019s eyes.\u201cMy god! That is the Xiao Clan Head. He actually can fly.\u201d\u201cCould it be that he is already a Martial King? Oh my God! With such a cultivation, he is unrivaled in Qizi County.\u201dThe Zhang Clan Head and Tang Clan Head looked at the disappearing Xiao Xiong, their faces clearly indicating that they did not understand. Tang Tian asked in doubt, \u201cThe duel is not over yet, why is he leaving so early? Could it be that he is aware of Leng Zhengyun\u2019s arrangements?\u201dThe Zhang Clan Head smiled indifferently, \u201cThat may be so. I\u2019m sure he already guessed that Xiao Chen\u2019s defeat is inevitable. Thus, he left in advance to make preparations.\u201dTang Tian still had doubts in his heart, \u201cI hope it is so. If we can win this duel, that would be the best. I do not wish to resort to that final move.\u201d\u201cFather, what\u2019s going on with the Clan Head? Were you discussing about Cousin Xiao Chen earlier?\u201d looking at the distant Xiao Xiong, Xiao Yulan sensed that something big was going to happen. She had no idea what it was though. It was completely baffling her.Xiao Qiang waved his hands and did not give her an answer, \u201cWatch the duel. Xiao Chen still has a chance. You don\u2019t need to think about these things.\u201dIn the ancestral hall of the Xiao Clan, Xiao Xiong knelt in the center and faced the hundreds of tablets within, saying in a sullen voice, \u201cHonored ancestors of the Xiao Clan. I, Xiao Xiong, am useless. I am not able to revitalize the glory of the Xiao Clan. If there were to be any punishments, please let them all fall on me. It has nothing to do with our descendants.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked at the remnants of the wooden sculpture on the ground and was filled with disbelief.He had heard of the Essence Light Arrow before, but he did not expect that it would appear in such an insignificant place like Mohe City... Or that such a heaven defying object would break his Life Bestowal Spell.\u201cChi! Chi!\u201dCountless frost crystals appeared behind Tang Feng, like stars made of ice. The temperature in the arena lowered significantly. Tang Feng had a solemn expression on his face as he held the bow with his left hand and drew the bowstring with his right. His right hand emitted a boundless radiance.Xiao Chen\u2019s heart trembled in fear; he saw this move in Gloomy Forest. However, this felt slightly different. The frost crystals behind Tang Feng suddenly disappeared, and countless sparks appeared. The cold air was swept away and a boundless heatwave surged in.\u201cMartial Technique, Icefire Flowing Cloud Arrow!\u201dInstantly an arrow made of intertwining ice and fire appeared on the bow. The arrow formed slowly and was fired out with a \u2018sou. The ice and fire were flowing around continuously on the arrow.It left behind a resplendent tail of light as it drilled through the air like a colorful ribbon; it looked extremely beautiful.\u201cBoom!\u201dThis was the fastest arrow that Xiao Chen had ever seen Tang Feng shoot. In one moment the arrow was still being formed on the bow, and in the next, it had turned into a magnificent streamer flying towards him.\u201cHeavenly Lightning Shield!\u201dIn such a situation, where he could not avoid the oncoming attack, Xiao Chen instantly executed the Heavenly Lightning Shield. The electrical light formed into a \u2018\u91d1\u2019 shape, and wrapped around Xiao Chen.\u201cCha!\u201dHeavenly Lightning Shield was instantly punctured. The Icefire Flowing Cloud Arrow pierced through with great momentum and hit Xiao Chen\u2019s right chest. The Qi and blood in his body churned. Xiao Chen could taste something sweet in his mouth as he vomited out a mouthful of blood.Tang Feng frowned slightly. When he saw that the Icefire Flowing Cloud Arrow did not pierce through Xiao Chen\u2019s body, he was slightly astonished.Tang Feng\u2019s right hand plucked the bowstring lightly, and an invisible energy was transmitted to the Icefire Flowing Cloud Arrow. After that, the energy arrow made of ice and fire exploded loudly.The Heavenly Lightning Shield was extremely weak from the inside, so it was instantly blasted apart. The huge energy of the intertwined ice and fire blasted Xiao Chen into the air, causing him to vomit another mouthful of blood.Xiao Chen felt that his entire body was in pain. He had never suffered such a severe injury before since coming to this world. He quickly took out a Blood Replenishing Pill and put in into his mouth in midair.\u201cSou! Sou! Sou!\u201dTang Feng did not wait for Xiao Chen to fall back down as he fired out three Icefire Flowing Cloud Arrows. Xiao Chen was wearing the Battle Armor, so the Icefire Flowing Cloud Arrows were not able to penetrate into his body.Xiao Chen was like a target board that was being blasted higher and higher by Tang Feng. The string of three explosions, and the surging shockwave, was like fireworks in the air. The resulting shockwave knocked Xiao Chen to a height of more than 200 meters.Tang Feng wiped the sweat off his forehead and revealed a cruel smile. Up until now, he did not dare to relax. Blasting Xiao Chen into the air was part of the tactics he had come up with long ago.Regardless of one\u2019s method, there was no way for one to be as agile as on the ground. This way, that person would become a living target. It could be said that Tang Feng already had victory in his grasp.\u201cXiao Chen is finished, he is now a living target.\u201d\u201cIndeed. Xiao Clan, quickly admit defeat. I can\u2019t bear to watch this any longer. He has been continuously shot at from the start to now.\u201d\u201cThe Xiao Clan is not surrendering yet; they still might have some trump cards to play.\u201d\u201cWhat other trump card is there? His Secret Treasure is already gone... What other divine object can he take out?\u201dEveryone discussed this, but most of them could not bear the current situation. No one expected that Tang Feng would be so strong. Originally, no one thought very highly of him. To think that he would actually corner Xiao Chen into such a situation.In the Xiao Clan\u2019s pavilion, Xiao Yulan\u2019s eyes were filled with tears as she looked at Xiao Chen. She said, \u201cFather, let\u2019s admit defeat. We can give up Seven Horn Mountain. Cousin Xiao Chen is about to die.\u201dBehind her, Xiao Ling`er, Ye Lan, and the others also had red eyes. No one had expected that Xiao Chen would put his life on the line like this... that the battle would be so cruel.\u201cIt is not time yet,\u201d Xiao Qiang said quietly. Xiao Yulan and the rest did not know about the Battle Armor Xiao Chen was wearing.In the Zhang Clan\u2019s and Tang Clan\u2019s pavilion, the Zhang Clan Head looked at Xiao Chen who was being shot continuously in the air. His face was filled with an elated expression, \u201cCongratulations! Your clan\u2019s Young Master is about to win. The Leng Clan will be rewarding you greatly.\u201dTang Tian\u2019s expression became relaxed. He leaned on the railings and smiled faintly, \u201cIt does not matter anymore. Not having to resort to that final move is the best result.\u201dXiao Chen, who was in the air, closed his eyes. He had an extremely calm expression. He carefully thought about every detail of this battle. He had been in too much of a rush to get close from the start.His Lightning Evasion had been revealed long ago, yet he still used it as a killing move. That was naive of him.Despite knowing that his opponent used long range attacks, he still used the Life Bestowal Spell. The battle against Zhang He had made him too confident.Every thought in Xiao Chen\u2019s brain was moving as fast as lightning.\u00a0Xiao Chen was trying his best to find a countermeasure for this situation. If he descended quickly, he would still be Tang Feng\u2019s live target board. He might as well rise higher into the sky and risk his life.[TL note: Interesting fact: Our brains works by electrical impulses. Hence, every thought we have is literally as fast as lightning. Some even say that it works by the vibration of electrons, and apparently that is faster than light. Of course, all these are not exactly proven.]After thinking up to this point, Xiao Chen roared angrily. The Azure Dragon Martial Spirit in his Dantian area leaped out of the pool of clear water with a loud sound. A stream of pure energy was transmitted to Xiao Chen\u2019s body.Using this energy, Xiao Chen brandished his saber upwards and his body climbed rapidly higher. Every time he waved the saber, he rose by ten odd meters.Unexpectedly, Xiao Chen discovered that this method also allowed him to evade the arrows that Tang Feng fired.Tang Feng, who was on the arena, watched as Xiao Chen rose higher and higher. After seeing him evade quite a few arrows, he frowned deeply.The arrows he shot out were not real arrows; they were made of fire and ice. If the distance was too far the accuracy would not decrease, but the speed would decrease significantly.An Essence Light Arrow appeared in his hand once again. He aimed it at Xiao Chen as he slowly drew the bowstring back. He focused his essence, energy, and spirit to their extreme. Streams of killing intent locked onto Xiao Chen.[TL note: \u7cbe\u6c14\u795e, essence, energy, and spirit is a traditional Chinese concept of how the body works. In Daoist tradition, there are three important aspects of everyone: Essence (\u7cbe), Energy (\u6c14) (Qi), and Spirit (\u795e). Essence is the condensed form of energy, representing the physical body; Energy (or Qi) is the formless energy running parallel to the physical body, representing the energy body; and Spirit represents the mental/thought/reason/cognition/aware mind, representing awareness and consciousness. Through the cultivation of Essence, Energy, and Spirit, Daoists believe that they can achieve physical health, longevity, and ultimately realize Dao.]Xiao Chen had kept his Spiritual Sense released. The moment Tang Feng released his killing intent, Xiao Chen felt it immediately. His heart trembled, and he quickly executed the Lightning Evasion.Executing the Lightning Evasion in mid-air consumed a large amount of Essence, but Xiao Chen did not hesitate. This killing intent made him feel an aura of death.\u201cSou!\u201dAt the instant Xiao Chen left, something flashed by underneath his feet gracefully. In the clear sky, it looked like a streak of lightning.When the glow flashed by, Xiao Chen had already appeared above a thousand meters in the sky. To the people below, he was merely a tiny black speck.\u201cWhat is Xiao Chen trying to do? With his cultivation level, it would exhaust a huge amount of Essence to execute such a flying technique. This is not something that a Martial Master can do.\u201dIn the Tang Clan\u2019s and Zhang Clan\u2019s pavilion, Tang Tian looked at the black speck in the sky and said worriedly.The Zhang Clan head smiled indifferently, \u201cBrother Tang you don\u2019t have to worry. It is obvious that he is trying to evade Tang Feng\u2019s arrows. He has no other choice. However, he would have to come down eventually.\u201d\u201cWhen that happens, even if he is not shot, he will fall to his death.\u201dIn the Xiao Clan\u2019s pavilion, the crowd also did not understand what Xiao Chen\u2019s intentions were. Only Xiao Qiang frowned in his heart but he was not very sure either, \u201cCould it be the Descending Divine Dragon Chop? However, this Martial Technique was already lost by the Xiao Clan long ago. Even if he truly has the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit, it is impossible to learn it.\u201dTang Feng\u2019s expression turned grave when he saw the black speck that was Xiao Chen. His earlier relaxed state was now completely gone.The third Essence Light Arrow was slowly nocked onto the bowstring. He aimed at the black speck in the sky as the aura of his body continued to surge upward. This was his final Essence Light Arrow. If he was not able to hit Xiao Chen with it, then he would be in trouble later.\u201cRoar!\u201dJust as the crowd was discussing what Xiao Chen was attempting to do, a powerful dragon\u2019s roar came from the sky. The aura of the ancient Holy Beast, the Azure Dragon, slowly pressed down from the sky.Everyone in the audience felt a pressure on their shoulders. It was an intangible pressure that pressed heavily on them. Their legs could not help but tremble.\u201cMeteor Burst!\u201d[TL note: Meteor Burst is Xiao Chen\u2019s name for Descending Divine Dragon Chop. He thought that he invented the move.]Xiao Chen roared loudly and an incorporeal dragon shadow appeared behind him. He descended towards the ground like a meteor, cutting through the air and separating streams of\u00a0Qi waves.\u201cSou!\u201dTang Feng had already completely drawn the Ice Fire Bow. With a \u2018shua\u2019 sound, the Essence Light Arrow was fired in the same manner as Chasing Stars Catching Moon, firing towards Xiao Chen in the sky.However, Xiao Chen was surrounded by a layer of an incorporeal Qi field. This was the Qi field created by the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit after executing the Meteor Burst.The Essence Light Arrow, which had a large amount of energy, was brushed to the side by the Qi field even before it got near to Xiao Chen, eventually vanishing into the sky.Tang Feng had a gaze filled with disbelief. Heavenly Craft Manor had used Superior Grade Frost Iron and a large amount of Moonstone to forge this Essence Light Arrow. To think that it could not even penetrate this Qi field.Before Tang Feng had the time to be astonished, Xiao Chen used the supreme dragon\u2019s might as he chopped down at him ruthlessly. Tang Feng executed his Movement Technique to the extreme and immediately leaped away by about ten meters.\u201cBoom!\u201dThere was a heaven shaking sound; the arena made of Heavenly Mountain Stones was loudly shattered. The surging shockwave caused countless pieces of rubble to fly off of the arena. The cultivators below the arena quickly used their Movement Techniques to try and evade.Even so, there were many people that were struck by debris. The large force caused these people to vomit blood. The scene was extremely chaotic.\u201cDescending Divine Dragon Chop! It is really the Descending Divine Dragon Chop!\u201d Xiao Qiang shouted excitedly. He did his best to see the situation on the arena, but dust was flying everywhere. No one could see the situation clearly.In the Zhang Clan\u2019s and Tang Clan\u2019s pavilion, Tang Tian had a face of displeasure as he said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that he would fall to his death? Why did such a scenario happen?\u201dThe Zhang Clan Head\u2019s expression was extremely unsightly. He did not know how to reply at this moment.When the dust on the arena slowly cleared away, everyone finally managed to precisely see the scene. Tang Feng was pale and in a corner, hanging on the walls of the arena in a sorry state. He was suspended up high, and trembling.One of his hands was doing its best to hold on, to not let his body fall down, while the other held the Ice Fire Bow tightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 87:\u00a0The Winner is King?Xiao Chen grasped the Lunar Shadow Saber tightly. His face was a little weak. The Meteor Burst exhausted a large portion of his Essence. In addition, he was injured previously. Thus, he was currently on the verge of collapsing. He was only holding on by sheer willpower and would faint in the next moment.\u201cHa!\u201dSuddenly, Tang Feng shouted out loudly. His right hand did everything possible to pull himself forward, and he flew up high in the air. When he landed, his body swayed unsteadily; it was obvious he had suffered severe injuries.Xiao Chen pushed off the ground with his feet fiercely, and his body flew forward. The electrical light of the Lunar Shadow Saber radiated in all directions; the full might of the Rank 6 Demonic Core was released, ruthlessly hacking at Tang Feng.\u201cQiang!\u201dThe Ice Fire Bow in Tang Feng\u2019s hand moved forward slightly and blocked Xiao Chen\u2019s saber. Withdrawing his bow and moving around slightly, the Ice Fire Bow attacked Xiao Chen from an odd angle.The two of them exchanged moves once again. Tang Feng used his bow as a weapon and, coupled with his excellent Movement Technique, he was able to keep things on even footing in close combat with Xiao Chen.Xiao Chen was secretly fearful in his heart; he did not expect Tang Feng to have a Martial Technique that would allow him to use the Ice Fire Bow as a close combat weapon.After Xiao Chen retreated backward by two steps, his right foot took a step forward, and his stance changed slightly. Suddenly, his aura rose. Tang Feng was slightly afraid and wanted to dodge to the side.\u201cDraw the Saber!\u201dElectricity crackled on the blade of the saber, and a streak of light flashed across.\u201cArclight Chop!\u201dThe tip of the saber was raised slightly, and an electrical light condensed on the saber blade. It drew out a lingering arclight in the air; the electricity on the arclight jumped around continuously.Tang Feng wanted to make a move to block it, but he discovered there was no weak point in this technique. The angle that the arclight came from had sealed off all possible angles of attack for him.When he finally decided to retreat, it was too late for him to completely evade. The arclight created a long wound on his chest. The leaping electricity surged into the wound and entered Tang Feng\u2019s body.The electricity easily circulated within Tang Feng, and his footsteps temporarily became disarrayed. He was extremely alarmed. He held the Ice Fire Bow in front of his chest and plucked the bowstring fiercely.\u201cBo!\u201dA great wave of flames, which brought along a boundless heat wave, swelled towards Xiao Chen.\u201cRushing Heaven Chop!\u201dXiao Chen leaped up high into the air, soaring towards the skies and directly breaking apart the wave of flames, finally piercing towards Tang Feng. The Lunar Shadow Saber had a reserved brilliance to it; it was not remotely fancy.Tang Feng\u2019s complexion was ashen as he decisively rolled backward. He did not have Feng Feixue\u2019s ingenuous Movement Techniques and could only choose to roll backward in a sorry state.\u201cRushing Thunder Chop!\u201dThere was an explosion behind Xiao Chen; it was shockingly loud, causing everyone\u2019s eardrums to tremble and making them dizzy. At this moment, Xiao Chen\u2019s aura rose to the extreme, bringing along the boundless atmosphere and might of thunder from the\u00a0nine heavens as he rushed forward.[TL note: The nine heavens is a chinese way of saying the sky; it refers to the central sky and its eight directions.]Tang Feng had just risen when he saw Xiao Chen descending as though he were a thunder god. He hurriedly grasped the Ice Fire Bow and raised it above his head, intending to block Xiao Chen\u2019s strike.He was very confident in the workmanship and the materials of the Ice Fire Bow. It was an Inferior Grade Profound Ranked Spirit Weapon, and furthermore, it was forged using Superior Grade Frost Iron.\u201cKa! Ka!\u201dThe huge force behind the Lunar Shadow Saber hacked down on the Ice Fire Bow. After a few crunching sounds, a crack appeared on the Ice Fire Box despite Tang Feng\u2019s confidence in the bow\u2019s durability.\u00a0It was actually going to break!\u201cRushing Thunder Second Chain Chop!\u201dAdding a chain after the boundless might of the Rushing Thunder Chop, Xiao Chen subsequently landed on the ground and seized the opportunity to execute a Rushing Thunder Second Chain Chop. Tang Feng was surprised and quickly used his bow to defend.\u201cBang!\u201dThe Ice Fire Bow broke on the spot. The Rushing Thunder Saber Technique executed five saber strikes in a go, and at this moment the violent energy that had accumulated thus far exploded out,\u00a0blasting\u00a0Tang Feng away.Tang Tian, who was in the pavilion, quickly jumped out and caught Tang Feng. His fingers moved as fast as lightning and poked a few spots on his chest. Then, he hurriedly took out a Medicinal Pill and fed it into his mouth.Only after Tang Tian inspected Tang Feng\u2019s wounds did his expression turn warmer. Looking at Xiao Chen, who was still in the arena, he said in an indifferent manner to the people who rushed over, \u201cLet\u2019s Go!\u201dDugu Feng slowly walked to the arena and announced, \u201cIn this year\u2019s Promise of Ten Years, the Xiao Clan is victorious once again. The rights to Seven Horn Mountain belong to the Xiao Clan. I hope the other clans will honor this result.\u201d\u201cCousin Xiao Chen, are you all right?\u201d Just as Dugu Feng finished his announcements, Xiao Yulan and the others rushed onto the arena.Xiao Ling`er\u2019s eyes were full of sparkles as she said, \u201cElder Brother Xiao Chen, now you are the hero of the Xiao Clan.\u201dYe Lan, Xiao Jian, and the other Xiao Clan disciples all surrounded him as well, congratulating him. The people below the arena felt that this result was too surprising; Xiao Chen\u2019s comeback was too sudden.Xiao Chen looked at the coward while feeling joy in his heart. With the effects of the Blood Replenishing Pill, his internal injuries were already half healed. However, due to the fact that he had overdrawn on his Essence, his body was finding it difficult to manage.Xiao Qiang parted the crowd and brought a few elders over. His expression was not that of joy obtained after victory. He first inspected Xiao Chen\u2019s injuries and then said, \u201cHurry back, the Clan Head has something to say to you.\u201dWhen they arrived, the Xiao Clan\u2019s people came with an extremely unsightly expression. Now that they had won the Promise of Ten Years, their expressions were much more relaxed.\u2026Mohe City, Tang Clan, Within A Secret Room:Tang Tian looked ashamed as he said to Leng Zhengyun, \u201cMy son is too useless and has wasted three of brother Leng\u2019s Essence Light Arrows.\u201dThe news of the two clans\u2019 defeats had already reached Leng Zhengyun\u2019s ears. When he heard Tang Tian\u2019s words, Leng Zhengyun said indifferently, \u201cIt does not matter. Man proposes but God disposes. It is enough that we did our best.\u201d[TL note: Man proposes but God disposes, this means that we as human can do everything we can but when fate/God intervenes, we become helpless.]Leng Yunze, who was standing at the side said, \u201cClan Head, please make the decision. The sixth elder already brought fifty Martial Grand Masters and hid them around the Xiao Clan grounds. We are just waiting for your command.\u201dTang Tian stood at the side and said, \u201cOur Tang Clan can provide fifty Martial Grand Masters for Brother Leng to command.\u201dThe Zhang Clan Head followed up by saying, \u201cOur Zhang Clan can provide twelve Martial Grand Masters for Brother Leng to command at any time.\u201d\u201cI await the Clan Head\u2019s order to destroy Xiao Chen. I will not hesitate,\u201d the four Martial Saints behind Leng Zhengyun said in a loud voice.Leng Zhengyun closed his eyes and thought about it for a long time before suddenly opening his eyes. His eyes were stern as he said in a heavy tone, \u201cBrother Zhang, how long would it take for your clan\u2019s Martial Grand Masters to gather?\u201dThe Zhang Clan Head smiled, \u201cI have already made arrangements. The twelve Martial Grand Masters of the Zhang Clan are already waiting outside the Tang Clan residence.\u201dLeng Zhengyun nodded his head and continued to make arrangements, \u201cBrother Zhang. Brother Tang. Aside from the Martial Grand Masters, how many cultivators are your two clans able to provide?\u201d\u201cThe Zhang Clan has a total of seventy Martial Masters and a hundred Martial Disciples.\u201d\u201cThe Tang Clan has a total of eighty Martial Masters and two hundred Martial Disciples.\u201dThere was a radiant look in Leng Zhengyun eyes as he said, \u201cGood! The two of you, send one person to lead these cultivators and stand guard on the road to the City Lord\u2019s residence. They must block the City Lord\u2019s people for two hours. Two hours later, after we have succeeded, they won\u2019t be able to salvage the situation.\u201dThe Zhang Clan Head and the Tang Clan Head had unsightly expressions on their faces as they said, \u201cGoing against the City Lord\u2019s people\u2026 Are you not afraid of his retaliation?\u201dLeng Zhengyun looked at the two of them and said in a grave tone, \u201cDo you think that us going to the Xiao Clan Residence is not already going against the City Lord? Do you think that the City Lord is unaware that we went to the Xiao Clan to injure their participants the last time?\u201d\u201cIf my Leng Clan did not have a strong backer, do you think that Dugu Feng would compromise?\u201dWhen the Tang Clan Head and Zhang Clan Head heard this, they breathed out in relief before saying, \u201cWe will do as Brother Leng says.\u201d\u201cDepart after half an hour. Exterminate the Xiao Clan; leave none alive,\u201d a look of determination and ruthlessness appeared on Leng Zhengyun\u2019s face.\u2026Mohe City, Xiao Clan, Within the Great Hall:Xiao Chen followed Xiao Qiang and the others to the great hall. Within the great hall, Xiao Xiong had a sullen expression as he sat upright on the wooden chair.Xiao Xiong smiled at Xiao Chen, \u201cXiao Chen, you have succeeded and won the duel for the Xiao Clan.\u201dHowever, after Xiao Xiong finished saying this, Xiao Chen felt that something was wrong. The surrounding Xiao Clan elders all had a complex expression on their faces. They did not have the expression of joyful people who had just won a competition.Xiao Xiong muttered to himself irresolutely for a long time before suddenly saying, \u201cXiao Chen, is your Martial Spirit the Azure Dragon Holy Beast? Tell me the truth.\u201dHow did he know?\u00a0Xiao Chen\u2019s heart sank. His thoughts were in a whirl. After a long time, he finally made a decision. This was something that would happen eventually; he could no longer hide from this.Xiao Chen looked at Xiao Xiong calmly and fearlessly, \u201cIn reply to father, my Martial Spirit is indeed the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit. Is there something wrong with that?\u201d[TL note: In reply to father: I believe this is a very formal way of replying to one\u2019s senior, in this case father.]\u201cAzure Dragon\u2026\u201d an elder who was beside them was about to explain, when suddenly there was the sound of killing coming from the front yard of the Xiao Residence. There were miserable cries; everyone\u2019s expressions changed.Xiao Chen trembled with fear in his heart as he quickly sent out his Spiritual Sense. Suddenly, his eyes turned red as he said fiercely, \u201cBastards! To think you actually dare to come. I shall make sure none of you will return.\u201dXiao Chen left the great hall and quickly executed the Gravity Spell, flying into the sky. He rushed ahead of Xiao Xiong and the others to the front yard.In the front yard, there was a group of cultivators from the Leng Clan maniacally slaughtering people. The weakest of this group were at least Martial Grand Masters; aside from them, there were six Martial Saints. The people from the Xiao Clan had no means of retaliating.\u201cPuci!\u201dA Xiao Clan disciple in the Inferior Grade Martial Disciple realm was struck by Tang Tian\u2019s palm and vomited a large mouthful of blood. His heart was shattered by the force of that palm strike;\u00a0he was stone-dead.\u201cDon\u2019t kill me! Wuwu\u2026\u201d a Xiao Clan girl was dashing towards the back, chasing after her was Leng Yunze. His face had a taunting expression on it, as though he were playing a game of cat and mouse; he chased after her slowly and was not in a rush to make any moves.\u201cBang!\u201dJust as the girl thought she could escape, Leng Yunze suddenly made his move. The gleam of a sword flashed by, and the head of the girl flew into the air.The perfect body, which was missing its head, still continued running forward for a few steps before stopping. The eyes on the head were opened wide, clearly full of shock.Leng Yunze looked indifferently at the body on the ground as he continued to send out sword Qi, slaughtering the other Xiao Clan disciples. With his cultivation level, there was practically no one who could defend against any of his moves.\u201cKill them all; leave none alive. Break through the front yard quickly,\u201d the Leng Clan Head said coldly, as he casually broke the neck of a Xiao Clan disciple.Countless cries of misery came from the ground and crept into Xiao Chen\u2019s ears. The entire Xiao Clan front yard was like hell. His eyes were red as he executed the Gravity Spell to its fullest, rapidly landing on a big door separating the front yard and the courtyard.[TL note: I am honestly not too sure about this, but the impression I got was front yard \u2192 courtyard \u2192 backyard \u2192 inner hall (where the great hall and ancestral hall are).]\u201cLing`er quickly leave. You arrived at the gate already. After you enter the backyard you should be safe,\u201d Ye Lan shouted to Xiao Ling`er as he did his best to hold back the attacks of a Martial Grand Master.Xiao Ling`er\u2019s eyes were full of tears as she cried out, \u201cYe Lan\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ye Lan ignored the wound, as he said anxiously to Xiao Ling`er,\u00a0\u201cQuickly go! If you don\u2019t go now, then it will be too late.\u201dJust as Ye Lan said this, the Martial Grand Master craftily changed the angle of his saber and pierced toward his chest. Ye Lan\u2019s heart went cold, and his eyes filled with despair.\u201cBang!\u201dIn the blink of an eye, Xiao Chen instantly executed the Lightning Evasion. The Lunar Shadow Saber chopped at the head of the Martial Grand Master. If he wished to continue attacking, then his own head will be forfeit.The Martial Grand Master had no other choice but to withdraw his attack. After checking out Xiao Chen, who appeared suddenly, she revealed an expression of joyful surprise, \u201cI caught a big fish. I wonder how the Clan Head will reward me after I kill you?\u201d\u201cCaptain Xiao Chen, weren\u2019t you in the great hall? Leave quickly! This place is too dangerous,\u201d Ye Lan exclaimed in shock as he looked at Xiao Chen, who had saved him.Xiao Ling`er saw Xiao Chen materialize unexpectedly, and after being pleasantly surprised she chimed in, \u201cElder Brother Xiao Chen, you should leave quickly. This place is too dangerous.\u201dXiao Chen stared at the Martial Grand Master in front of him and did not turn his head around. He said indifferently, \u201cYou should leave first. Trust me. I\u2019m your captain right?\u201d\u201cStill not leaving? Are you trying to cause me to be distracted?\u201d Xiao Chen said sternly, his expression turning cold as he saw that the two of them had not moved yet.\u201cTake care, Captain!\u201d\u201cElder Brother Xiao Chen, you must be careful,\u201d the two of them exhorted him before hurriedly turning around and dashing away.Sensing these words with his Spiritual Sense, Xiao Chen did not bother to waste time on the person in front of him, and retreated to the gate between the front yard and the courtyard.This was the only entrance leading to the courtyard and the great hall. As long as Xiao Chen defended this spot completely, then no matter how strong these people were, they would not be able to get in.After this delay, a few Xiao Clan disciples managed to withdraw from the front yard. When the front yard was completely cleared of Xiao Clan disciples, the Leng Clan Head led a group of Martial Saints, and more than a hundred Martial Grand Masters, to the front of Xiao Chen.\u201cClan Head, this is Xiao Chen,\u201d Leng Yunze explained to Leng Zhengyun as he looked at Xiao Chen angrily.Lan Chaoyang said in an indifferent manner, \u201cJust an Inferior Grade Martial Master. To think he could actually escape from Elder Leng\u2019s hands... How unimaginable.\u201dWhen Leng Zhengyun heard these words, he frowned slightly before saying in a stern tone, \u201cThe two of you, deal with him quickly. If you are not able to deal with him within three moves, I will give you a demerit and will punish you later.\u201dXiao Chen\u2019s eyes were bloodshot as he looked at the crowd in front of him.\u00a0The hands of all these people were stained with the blood of the Xiao Clan disciples. They should all be killed!Suddenly a boundless killing intent exploded out from Xiao Chen\u2019s eyes. His right hand quickly formed a hand seal and the blood essence that was buried deeply in the talismans was instantly activated, creating a strange connection.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe clear and boundless sky was suddenly covered in dark clouds, rolling around endlessly, and the crackle of thunder rang out unceasingly.In an instant, the sky turned dark!In eight directions of the Xiao Residence, scarlet pillars rose up into the sky. Xiao Chen immediately flew up thousands of meters in the sky.Countless lightning bolts surrounded him as claps of thunder resounded, turning Xiao Chen\u2019s face to flash between dark and bright. He was like a thunder god standing in the sky, giving of a supreme might.Xiao Chen cautiously controlled the electricity around him, and the Ninth Heaven\u2019s Thunder Formation unceasingly pulled in that armageddon-level energy frantically. If Xiao Chen was even slightly inattentive in his control of this energy, he would suffer from a rebound and be immediately blasted into dust.\u201cClan Head, what is going on?\u201d this new situation instigated indescribable panic in the people from the Leng Clan.The lightning in the dark clouds was like a sharp blade that carried a deathly aura, ready to descend at any time.Leng Zhengyun revealed an extremely grave expression; after a long time, he said in a dazed manner, \u201cThis is a formation,\u00a0a\u00a0formation that has not been seen since ancient times. Why is there someone who can lay a formation?\u201d\u201cQuick! Shoot him down! Or else we will all die here,\u201d Leng Zhengyun suddenly shouted out.A group of cultivators aimed their bows toward the sky, but the arrows that sped towards Xiao Chen did not get anywhere near him. Before they came remotely close, they were smashed to smithereens by the lightning in the clouds.Outside the front yard, Xiao Xiong led the Xiao Clan\u2019s elite members and rushed over. Seeing Xiao Chen in the sky and the countless lightning bolts in the dark clouds, his complexion changed, \u201cThere is no more need to rush forward. That is the long lost formation from the ancient times. If we step into it, we will be killed by mistake.\u201dWhen Xiao Qiang heard those words, his complexion changed, \u201cThe formations of the legends require a person to be of a high cultivation realm. Will the Second Young Master be able to sustain it?\u201dThe expression on Xiao Xiong\u2019s face was incomparably grave. He turned his head to Liu Fengyin and said, \u201cElder Liu, if anything happens to Xiao Chen, please bring him away the moment it is possible. This is my plea to you; you must agree to this.\u201dLiu Fengyin just nodded his head and said nothing, agreeing to Xiao Xiong\u2019s request.Leng Zhengyun looked at the arrows that were turned into dust, and a trace of fear appeared in his eyes. After a long time, he shouted out loudly and bent his knees. Pushing off the ground fiercely, he leaped into the sky.Before Leng Zhengyun made a move, the countless lightning bolts in the dark clouds, under the direction of Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense, broke through the sky and struck Leng Zhengyun immediately.The strong electrical energy crushed Leng Zhengyun down, causing him to land heavily on the ground. His body was charred black and was seizing continuously.\u201cClan Head, are you alright?\u201d the people beside rushed over to help him up. They checked his wounds and fed him Medicinal Pills.After Leng Zhengyun ate the Medicinal Pill, his complexion became better. He said weakly, \u201cQuick, run! Before the Eye of the Formation is formed. Leave here quickly! Don\u2019t bother about me. My internal organs have all been shattered by the electricity already. There is no more chance for me to survive.\u201dRight after Leng Zhengyun said that, he fainted,\u00a0\u201cClan Head! Clan Head! Are you alright?!\u201d\u201cMight of the brilliant sky, guided by Qi. Thunder gods of the nine heavens, head my call and Smite!\u201dXiao Chen\u2019s hands ceaselessly made hand seals as the lightning in the sky surged. It was like there were thousands of horses and men. It was vast and mighty, without boundaries, and its aura shook the heavens.Just as Xiao Chen\u2019s voice sounded out, countless lightning bolts descended towards the ground. They crashed down loudly, the dark and gloomy sky flickering and flashing brightly every time there was a thunder clap.\u201cAh!\u201d a Martial Grand Master was struck by lightning and in the time it took for him to let out that miserable shriek, his flesh became badly mangled, and he died on the spot.\u201cQuick! Run!\u201dEveryone was frightened by the horrifying might; they all rushed backward in panic.Xiao Chen smiled coldly in his heart,\u00a0You think you can run?\u00a0With the assistance of the Ninth Heaven\u2019s Thunder Formation, his Spiritual Sense covered the entire Xiao Residence and left a hidden mark in the body of everyone in this crowd. The lightning would automatically chase after the people with hidden marks in them.\u201cBoom! Boom! Boom! Boom!\u201dAfter countless lightning bolts descended, the place became like hell. The sounds of miserable cries rang out without end. Every time there was a crash of thunder, that meant a life was reaped.Xiao Chen had no pity for them in his heart. When he thought of that girl earlier, the girl whose body kept running for a bit even after her head was chopped off, his heart was unable to remain calm.Using his Spiritual Sense, he made a quick scan of the sky, and he quickly discovered Leng Yunze. This fellow was jumping around and actually managed to dodge a few lightning strikes.The corner of Xiao Chen\u2019s mouth curled up as his body flashed through the sky, arriving at the front of Leng Yunze.Seeing Xiao Chen appear suddenly, Leng Yunze was startled in his heart; he said in a stern voice, \u201cXiao Chen, you actually dare to appear in front of me, how reckless\u2026\u201dXiao Chen said nothing; he merely stretched out his finger. A lightning bolt as thick as a bucket descended from the sky. Before Leng Yunze could finish what he wanted to say, he was struck by lightning and turned into meat paste, giving off a barbecued smell.Xiao Chen laughed coldly, as he kicked Leng Yunze\u2019s body into the air. With a flash of his saber, Leng Yunze was chopped into two halves.Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense continued to expand out as he proceeded to find the Martial Saint Experts. The Movement Techniques of these people were shocking; they were actually able to evade the fast lightning bolts.\u201cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u201dUnder Xiao Chen\u2019s direction, another few lightning bolts, which were also as thick as buckets, struck those Martial Saints. None of them managed to escaped, and they were all turned to mush.After half an hour, Xiao Chen slowly descended from the sky. There were charred bodies everywhere in the front yard. None of the offending Martial Grand Masters and Martial Saints had escaped.The dark clouds scattered, and the eight scarlet light pillars in the Xiao Residence\u2019s surroundings slowly sank into the ground. The instant the light pillars disappeared, the horrifying energy of heaven and earth also disappeared, and sunlight shined on the ground once again.A piercing pain shot through Xiao Chen\u2019s brain. Veins could be clearly seen on his pale countenance. Amidst the pain, Xiao Chen could feel the energy in his body rapidly decreasing.\u201cBoom!\u201dAn explosion occurred in his Dantian area. Xiao Chen\u2019s cultivation actually decreased by a realm, turning him back into a Superior Grade Martial Disciple once again.After the pain in his brain slowly disappeared, Xiao Chen ate a Qi Returning Pill. He smiled bitterly to himself,\u00a0To kill this group of people, I have wasted the cultivation of an entire realm.However, he did not regret it at all. For such a bunch of people as these, even if Xiao Chen\u2019s cultivation level dropped back to Spirit Refinement, he would not hesitate to use the Ninth Heaven\u2019s Thunder Formation.\u201cShua! Shua!\u201dXIao Chen could hear the sound of footsteps rushing over, as Xiao Xiong led the Xiao Clan\u2019s people. Xiao Qiang rushed forward and checked the condition of Xiao Chen\u2019s body. There was a startled expression on his face, \u201cTo think that you actually dropped a cultivation level. This is too strange. It is simply unheard of.\u201dWhen Xiao Xiong saw that Xiao Chen had not suffered from any major injuries, he breathed out in relief. He returned back to the previous topic, \u201cXiao Chen, is your Martial Spirit the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit?\u201d\u201cSo what if it is, and so what if it is not\u2026\u201d Xiao Chen only felt incredibly fatigued. When confronted with this question again, he had already lost all patience for it.Xiao Xiong\u2019s expression turned cold; he had never expected that Xiao Chen would use such a tone to speak to him. Speaking in a sullen tone, \u201cIf it is so, then you can leave already. Never come back to Mohe City. The further the better.\u201dXiao Chen was startled. Although he had already planned to leave the Xiao Clan after the Promise of Ten Years, he never expected that there would be such an ending... that Xiao Xiong actually wanted to banish him.Xiao Yulan was astonished and said, \u201cClan Head, Xiao Chen has just done a great service for us, why are you chasing him away?\u201dXiao Xiong took out a stack of banknotes as well as two bottles filled with Medicinal Pills. He said to Xiao Chen, \u201cHere are banknotes worth one hundred thousand silver taels and two bottles filled with Grade Three Medicinal Pills. Keep them.\u201dYe Lan suddenly knelt on the ground, \u201cClan Head, please retract that order. Don't chase Second Young Master away.\u201dXiao Ling`er also suddenly knelt, \u201cEldest Uncle, don\u2019t chase Elder Brother Xiao Chen away. He is now the hero of our Xiao Clan!\u201d\u201cClan Head, please retract that order! Don't chase Second Young Master away.\u201d Those people who were with Xiao Chen in the Trial of Gloomy Forest as well as the people who were just saved by Xiao Chen all knelt down.Xiao Xiong said angrily, \u201cWhat are you all doing? Rebelling?\u201dXiao Chen said nothing and slowly walked over, helping everyone up.Afterwards, there was a \u2018bang\u2019. In front of everyone, Xiao Chen knelt in front of Xiao Xiong and kowtowed heavily in front of him.\u201cThis kowtow represents my gratitude to you. Without you, I, Xiao Chen,\u00a0would not have been born into this world.\u00a0Regardless of the decision you make, I will not blame you.\u201d\u201cBang!\u201d Xiao Chen kowtowed heavily again, saying, \u201cThis kowtow, is to thank the elders of the Xiao Clan for the care you have shown me after I arrived into this world.\u201d\u201cBang!\u201d\u201cThis kowtow is for the the brothers and sisters who pleaded for me. Real men have gold under their knees; they may only kneel to heaven and earth, and their parents. I, Xiao Chen, am not worthy of you kneeling for me.\u201dAfter Xiao Chen said this, he dashed away frantically, not taking the money and pills that Xiao Xiong prepared for him. He continuously used the Lightning Evasion, and his figure quickly disappeared from everyone's views.Chasing after him was Xiao Yulan. As she watched Xiao Chen gradually getting further, her eyes filled with tears and she sobbed silently.Outside Mohe City, Xiao Chen looked at the tall city walls and used the Life Bestowal Spell to make a small bird. He took out a recipe he had prepared in an envelop long ago and tied it onto the bird\u2019s legs, sending it to Mo Fan\u2019s residence.The recipe was of a Medicinal Pill that could treat broken legs. Due to the fact that Xiao Chen was not able to find the ingredients, he was not able to refine it.Since he was leaving Mohe City, he could only give him the recipe. He also made a request of him in the letter, hoping that he would protect the Xiao Clan for the next three years.Although Xiao Chen was unable to see thorough Mo Fan\u2019s strength, it was at least that of a peak Martial Saint. With his protection, even if the Xiao Clan met with a calamity, they should be able to sail over it.Watching the small bird gradually disappearing into the sky, Xiao Chen said in a somewhat sentimental manner in his heart,\u00a0Goodbye, Mohe City!When he turned around, he saw a face that somewhat surprised him. Xiao Chen did not know why, but the depressed feelings he had in his heart lightened when he saw that beautiful and elegant figure.\u201cFeng Feixue, is this part of your calculations? That I would be chased out of the Xiao Clan today? So you have been waiting for me here.\u201dWearing men\u2019s clothes and holding a fan in her hand, the elegant Feng Feixue smiled faintly when she heard this, \u201cI do not have any other intentions; I just wanted to send you off, as well as to give you something.\u201dHer hands made a quick motion and suddenly a Martial Technique manual flew towards Xiao Chen. Xiao Chen suspiciously received it and looked at the words on the cover, slowly reading it out loud, \u201cAzure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art!\u201dXiao Chen was astonished in his heart. The expression on his face did not change as he smiled faintly, \u201cTo others, this Martial Technique would be worthless. To me, this is a priceless treasure. I do not believe that you would give me something so good for free.\u201d\u201cJust be direct and tell me of your requests. The thing that you are giving me is something that I really need. As long as I am capable of doing it, I will do it to the best of my abilities.\u201dFeng Feixue felt that Xiao Chen\u2019s words were very interesting. This was the first time she saw a man that dared to be so direct with her. She smiled, \u201cIn the future, when I run into difficulties, I want you to come and help me. I will not tell you about how you will help yet, but you are definitely able to do it.\u201d\u201cDeal! In the future, if you can find me, I will come when you call.\u201d After saying that, Xiao Chen turned and walked away without looking back.Seeing Xiao Chen agree to it so fast, Feng Feixue was stunned. By the time she reacted, she discovered that Xiao Chen was already a distance away. She shouted loudly, \u201cXiao Chen! Are you not afraid that I\u2019m taking advantage of you?\u201dXiao Chen, in the distance, did not stop or slow down. He held the Martial Technique manual and waved his hand. His voice resounded slowly, \u201cI trust you!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Something big happened in Hunluo Prefecture, in the Qizi County.\u201dOn the second floor, a cultivator wearing coarse robes was chatting with his\u00a0four companions, who were all grouped around him. He looked wild and strong, and his eyebrows were especially thick, giving him an air of heroism.This inn was known as Liushang Pavilion, the biggest inn in White Water City. There was a total of five floors, with each floor becoming progressively more expensive the higher a person climbed.[TL note: Liushang has the meaning of flowing smoothly.]The third floor and above required, besides a great reserve of silver taels, that one had sufficient status; wealth without status did not make one eligible to enter the higher floors.Furthermore, the fifth floor of Liushang Pavilion was a legendary place that only entertained distinguished guests of similar rank to that of the White Water City Lord, and was normally not open for business.Regular citizens normally dined on the first floor, while regular cultivators preferred to dine on the second floor. Since White Water City was close to the Savage Forest, it was rife with cultivators. Therefore, the second floor of Liushang Pavilion had the most traffic.When his companion beside him heard that, he curiously said, \u201cI have heard a little about this matter. There was a youth in Qizi County who killed ten Martial Saints and more than 200 Martial Grand Masters in a single day.\u201dAnother cultivator pitched in and said, \u201cWhat I heard was 50 Martial Saints and 500 Martial Grand Masters.\u201dWhen a certain youth beside the window on the second floor heard this, he choked and spat out the mouthful of wine he had swigged just now. He muttered to himself in his heart,\u00a0Rumors\u2026 Oh rumors\u2026 At the rate they are spreading and growing, I\u2019ll soon be capable of killing Martial Kings with one palm strike.The youth wiped away the stains around his mouth and picked up a piece of wood and a carving knife from the table, deciding to rather focus on his carving. The sunlight shined through the window onto his handsome face, giving it a faint golden glow.The youth had an extremely serious expression on his face, which was complemented by a bearing so meticulous as to allude to the object in his hand being not a wooden carving but a priceless and precious treasure. His solemn, respectful, and focused expression gave him a certain charm and grace.A white fox rested beside the youth. It looked absolutely adorable and was happily wolfing down a bowl of fish porridge. Before long, the bowl of fish porridge was empty.It carefully climbed onto the table and licked the empty porcelain bowl, patting the right arm of the youth with its right paw.The youth stopped what he was doing and looked at the Spirit Fox. He discovered that it was looking at him in a pitiful manner, with big round eyes that were misting up. Its other paw was clearly pointing at the empty porcelain bowl.When the youth saw this, he smiled faintly, \u201cXiao Bai\u2026 Xiao Bai\u2026 You are truly a glutton.\u201d\u201cWaiter! Serve me another bowl of fish porridge, and give me the large one,\u201d the youth shouted loudly, placing the order.Shortly after, the waiter ran over with a large bowl of porridge. Although he moved fast, his hands and feet were very stable. It was obvious that this waiter had cultivated martial arts to some degree.\u201cDang!\u201dThe porridge was placed stably on the table without a drop of it spilling out. The waiter smiled and said, \u201cThe fish porridge, as ordered. If the Sir has any other requests, do let us know.\u201dThe youth waved his hands and and threw out a silver ingot as his tip. The waiter joyfully received it and quickly left after expressing his gratitude.When the Spirit Fox saw the new serving of fish porridge, its pitiful expression immediately disappeared. It completely forgot about the youth's existence as it rushed to the fish porridge with a joyful expression on its muzzle.The youth chided it playfully, \u201cWhen there is food, you immediately forget about your master.\u201d Having said that, he paid it no further mind and continued to focus on carving the piece of wood in his hand.This youth was the very Xiao Chen of Mohe City from the rumors. After he left the Xiao Clan, his immediate destination was Heavenly Saber Pavilion, seeking to enter their ranks in hopes of finding a way to awaken Ao Jiao, who was currently asleep inside the Lunar Shadow Saber.However, after he left, he had a taste of just how massive this world was. Even the scale of the Great Qin Nation completely exceeded his imagination.The Great Qin Nation, aside from the Imperial Capital and the Royal Court, had three provinces: Dongming Province, Xihe Province, and Nanling Province. Each province had three prefectures, and each prefecture had seven counties. The size of each county was already equivalent to half the size of his country in his previous life. One can only imagine how huge the size of the Great Qin Nation was.[TL note: Given that the MC used Taobao and this is a chinese novel, my guess is that this country in question refers to\u00a0China.]The Mohe City that Xiao Chen came from was only an extremely ordinary city.\u00a0There was still the Qizi County, Hunluo Prefecture, and Dongming Province above it.The Heavenly Saber Pavilion was in the Xihe Province, relative to the Dongming Province; one was in the east and the other in the west. They were separated by tens of thousands of kilometers. Xiao Chen had already been on the road for two months. Along the way, he had discovered that every year, in the tenth month, the Heavenly Saber Pavilion would conduct an entrance exam in order to recruit new disciples.The criterias of this entrance exam were very stringent. Xiao Chen calculated the time he had left. It was now the seventh month of the year, which was just three months away from the entrance exam of the Heavenly Saber Pavilion.He intended to train himself through practical experiences for three months before leaving for Heavenly Saber Pavilion. This was to prevent himself from failing the entrance exam and having to wait for the tenth month of the next year to retake the test.This White Water City was the capital of Sishui Prefecture, which sat on the borders of Dongming Province. Upon leaving the city, one could find the holy ground for\u00a0training, Savage Forest. Furthermore, it was relatively closer to Xihe Province. Thus, Xiao Chen decided on carrying out his training in White Water City.\u201cTong! Tong! Tong!\u201dThe sound of footfalls began to emerge from the stairs to the second floor, followed shortly by the arrival of a crowd of people chatting merrily with one another before they made their way towards the third floor.When the cultivators on the second floor saw who they were, they all fell silent. The earlier incredibly noisy floor instantly turned soundless. Everyone kept their heads down and maintained a low profile as they ate in silence.One of the individuals in the crowd wore embroidered clothings and was very handsome. He was very pleased with the atmosphere on the second floor. He then turned and spoke to the girl beside him in a low voice.No emotion could be seen on the girl\u2019s face. She just politely replied to the other person\u2019s words, and there was no expression of joy at all. In this very moment, her eyes lit up when she saw the Spirit Fox beside Xiao Chen at the window side.This made her stop in her tracks, and the light in her eyes grew brighter. She slowly walked towards Xiao Chen\u2019s table; at a single glance, it was clear her gait had a certain grace and her disposition a certain beauty.\u201cFriend, is this Spirit Beast for sale?\u201d the\u00a0girl\u00a0looked at the Spirit Fox for a long time until she could no longer resist asking. Her voice was melodious and delicate, and anyone who heard it would feel comfortable, while rooting those faint of heart with the desire to comply to her every whim.Xiao Chen had noticed the figures of this group of people long ago. He raised his head and looked towards the girl. He praised her silently in his heart.\u00a0This girl wore a green dress, and her eyebrows were picturesque; she had white teeth, bright eyes, and an almond shaped face with peach-like cheeks. All these combined with her exquisite green dress gave off the feeling of a refreshing beauty.However, Xiao Chen had seen too many beautiful girls. The elegant fairy-like Feng Feixue or the irreproachable, sweet-tempered Xiao Yulan were not any whit inferior to this girl. Furthermore, there was that absolute beauty and femme fatale Yue Ying who made all others pale in comparison.Xiao Chen quickly withdrew his gaze from her body and said indifferently, \u201cIf\u00a0you truly understood, then you would not even mention buying it. Please leave.\u201dHer heart trembled, as she thought it possible that Xiao Chen would reject her, but she had not expected Xiao Chen to be so direct, not showing any mercy.Her pretty face looked distracted for a moment, and then she had an apologetic smile on as she said, \u201cIt is indeed by oversight. I underestimated the feelings of this brother towards his Spirit Beast. Only\u2026 does Brother have no intentions of selling it at all? \u00a0If you tell me what you want, I will definitely think of a way to use it to exchange for the Spirit Beast.\u201dWhat grand words,\u00a0Xiao Chen smiled coldly to himself.\u00a0This girl is indeed not simple. She\u2019s actually able to see through the bloodline of Xiao Bai... that it is\u00a0the progeny of the Six-Tailed Spirit Fox.As long as a naturally born Rank 6 Spirit Beast could\u00a0mature, it would be like having a strong Martial King expert at one\u2019s side. Within Dongming Province, a Martial King was someone who even the big noble clans would do their utmost to recruit.It was even to the point where, to some people, the number of Martial Kings a clan had under their banner represented the strength of that clan.Xiao Chen guessed in his heart that she was probably clear on how he was only a Superior Grade Martial Disciple and thought that Xiao Chen had obtained the Spirit Fox by chance and was therefore oblivious to its value.\u00a0Thus,\u00a0she wanted to try and take advantage of that.Thinking of this, Xiao Chen put down the wooden carving in his hand and smiled pleasantly, \u201cYou have to keep your word. As long as I ask for it, you will definitely do it?\u201dThe girl saw that Xiao Chen was giving her some leeway, immediately feeling joy in her heart. She smiled brightly, \u201cOf course I will keep it. As long as you ask for it, I will definitely do it.\u201dHer words were very grand, but she expected Xiao Chen to be merely an ordinary Superior Grade Martial Disciple. One that had not seen much of the world and would not be able to ask for something of too high a price. With her clan\u2019s strength behind her, she was confident she could satisfy Xiao Chen\u2019s request.A sincere and serious look appeared on Xiao Chen\u2019s face as he said, \u201cThen give me a Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon. How\u2019s that? It\u2019s a fair deal, and both of us will not suffer a disadvantage.\u201dThe girl\u2019s expression turned cold. She knew that Xiao Chen was messing with her. She looked meaningfully at him and then left slowly without saying anything else.\u201cBrat, you refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit. It is your fortune that Miss Duanmu wanted to buy your thing. Yet you spoke such nonsense. Are you seeking death?\u201d behind the man dressed in embroidered clothing, a person dressed in servant's clothes said fiercely and viciously to Xiao Chen.When the girl heard these words, she frowned slightly. It was clear that she was not pleased. The man dressed in embroidered clothing saw that his servant had made her unhappy in his attempt to suck up to her and hurriedly\u00a0called\u00a0for him to stop.He turned his head to face Xiao Chen and said, \u201cI\u2019m Jiang Muheng. If you change your mind, you can come and find me at the Jiang Clan at any time.\u201d\u201cMiss Duanmu, let\u2019s go up first. Young Master Hua is still waiting for us on the fourth floor.\u201dThe group of people left Xiao Chen\u2019s table and headed towards the fourth floor. Xiao Chen extended his Spiritual Sense out and slowly followed this group of people.\u201cGo back and check on the background of that brat. If he does not have any notable background, then just snatch the Spirit Fox away. It is rare to come across something that Miss Duanmu likes.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, is killing permitted?\u201d\u201cUp to you, but everything must be done cleanly. I do not wish for Miss Duanmu to have any suspicions about this.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, Young Master, it shall be done by tomorrow morning. It\u2019s only a Superior Grade Martial Disciple. I can squash him with just one hand.\u201dWhen the group of people went up to the fourth floor, Jiang Muheng had dragged his servant over to a corner and told him of his plans. However, he did not expect that Xiao Chen had noticed something was afoot and had used his Spiritual Sense to memorize every word he had just said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This guy offended the Young Miss of the Duanmu Clan. He is probably going to die.\u201d\u201cOffending the Duanmu Clan is nothing. The one he has to be careful of is the eldest son of the Jiang Clan. That youth caused Duanmu Qing to be humiliated in the Jin Clan\u2019s territory, so Jiang Muheng is definitely not going to let him off the hook.\u201d\u201cThis youth is definitely a foreigner. He actually managed to offend both the top noble clan of Sishui Prefecture and the top noble clan of White Water City.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, he is only a Superior Grade Martial Disciple. His death is only a matter of time.\u201dAfter seeing what happened earlier, the cultivators within the second floor waited for that group of people to leave first before looking at Xiao Chen, shaking their heads and sighing.Xiao Chen did not mind and just smiled indifferently. He continued carving the piece of wood in his hand. When the final\u00a0stroke\u00a0was done, he blew at the wooden carving with satisfaction.Xiao Bai did not know what was going on and raised its weird eyes and looked all around. As nothing of interest caught its eyes, it continued to happily eat its fish porridge.\u201cPeng! Peng!\u201dA fatty from the second floor, adorned with glittering jewelry, walked towards Xiao Chen. There were loud booming sounds as he trod on the floor, causing everyone to wonder if he would create a hole in it.He beamed brightly as he walked over, and his tiny eyes were reduced to an even tinier, curved slit. Originally, this was supposed to portray a face radiant with happiness, but his face seemed wretched instead.\u201cFriend, may I sit down and have some wine?\u201d right as he said that, he immediately sank his\u00a0plump ass down\u00a0without even waiting for Xiao Chen to reply. Beaming broadly, he continued, \u201cFriend, you are very straightforward, accepting my request so quickly.\u201dThere were all sorts of rings on his finger. There were jadeite, white jade, gold;\u00a0you name it, he has it. He held a folding fan made of gold in his hand, which matched his jewelry-adorned clothes.It was a get-up that screamed of wealth. It was as tacky as it could be, to the point where it was extremely vulgar.Xiao Chen picked up his wine cup and lightly took a sip. He did not mind the intrusion and smiled, \u201cAre you here to buy this Spirit Fox as well?\u201dWith a \u2018shua\u2019 sound, that fatty opened up his gold folding fan and began fanning himself, acting cultured and elegant. Unfortunately, with his get-up, it looked extremely strange instead.If Feng Feixue, who used a folding fan as well, saw this fatty, would she smack him to death with a palm?\u00a0thinking of this, Xiao Chen could not help but smile.The fatty fanned himself vigorously for a while, as if to exhibit a certain atmosphere before composedly replying to Xiao Chen\u2019s question, \u201cI\u2019m not that silly. Although that girl from the Duanmu Clan was able to make out the bloodline of this Spirit Beast, she was unable to see that this Spirit Beast had already made a blood contract.\u201cAs long as you are not dead, even if someone bought the Spirit Beast, it would run back by itself. Whoever buys it is just stupid.\u201dXiao Chen was astonished \u2013 this fatty had great insight. He could not help but ask in a serious manner, \u201cI have not asked you for your great name yet.\u201dWhen the fatty saw that his words had astonished Xiao Chen, he laughed cockily. The fat on his face jiggled. When Xiao Chen saw this, he was alarmed, afraid that these two pieces of flesh would fall off.\u201cHa ha, my family name is Jin and my name is Dabao. What do you think? Sounds domineering, right? My dad gave me the name Jin Da, but I felt that it was too ordinary so I added the Bao word.[TL notes: The Chinese like to give their names and family name separately.]Xiao Chen began sweating profusely in his heart; Jin Da, Jin Dabao\u2026 they were indeed father and son. Xiao Chen laughed incredulously, \u201cHa ha. Brother Jin, your name is indeed domineering.\u201dJin Dabao was very satisfied with Xiao Chen\u2019s behaviour, smiling as he said, \u201cBrother, stop dawdling, give me your name as well. The moment I met you, I felt that we were very similar.\u201d\u201cXiao Chen.\u201dJin Dabao rubbed his lower chin as he muttered to himself in a soft voice, \u201cXiao Chen\u2026 This name sounds quite familiar. Forget it, my head hurts thinking about it.\u201d\u201cBrother Xiao, to tell you the truth, I\u2019m quite interested in the wooden carving in your hand. I wonder if you would allow me to check it out.\u201dRight after he said that, his right hand moved in a careless manner and the wooden carving on the table immediately appeared in his hand. Xiao Chen was astonished once again, and he carefully reviewed Jin Dabao\u2019s earlier movements in his mind.If I knew what he was thinking in advance, I would be somewhat confident in stopping and preventing him from obtaining the wooden carving.Xiao Chen continuously re-enacted the situation in his mind, but he was not able to stop him even after numerous simulations. This fatty\u2019s speed might not seem fast, but it had a natural feel to it.It looked incredibly casual, just like a friend greeting you before taking away your things from right under your nose as though it was normal.Actually, this was a type of concealment and misdirection. If he did not wish for you to know, then it was highly likely that he, the perpetrator, would elude you even after you realized your item was missing.Jin Dabao was just an Inferior Grade Martial Master, but Xiao Chen put up his guard around him, classifying him as a terrifying person.Jin Dabao kept rubbing the wooden carving as he held it. There was a twinkle in his eyes, which looked extremely disgusting. It was as disgusting as possible, an appearance with the semblance of a male pig in love. This was the only, single way for Xiao Chen to describe him.Xiao Chen could no longer bear to continue watching and snatched the wooden carving back. He was afraid that, if this fat person kept rubbing it, the wooden carving would be abraded till it was flat.Damn it!Xiao Chen held it in his hand and took a look: the chest area of the Yue Ying carving had been worn completely flat, to a point where the bra was completely gone and no longer visible. Xiao Chen was speechless,\u00a0How disgusting does this idiot have to be for him to be able to do this?Seeing Xiao Chen lose control of himself, Jin Dabao did not show even a trace of shame as he laughed twice before looking at Xiao Chen vulgarly, \u201cHow unexpected! So Brother Xiao actually shares the same interests. To think you are actually capable of making such a realistic carving of the goddess in my heart, and one that seems even more realistic than the actual person at that.\u201d\u2018Are you selling this wooden carving? Wait! That won\u2019t do, carve a new one for me. I will exchange an Earth Rank Spirit Weapon for it.\u201d\u201cThe words of I, Jin Dabao, are like gold. I definitely keep my word. I also conduct business in a fair manner. I will not be like a certain girl, trying to cheat and play you for a fool.\u201dEven if I carved another one for you, you would rub it till there is nothing left \u2013 not even dregs!\u00a0Xiao Chen thought in his heart. Looking at the wooden carving that had its depiction of a chest rubbed flat, Xiao Chen remembered that Fatty Jin\u2019s sweat was still on it. He suddenly felt incomparably disgusted.He fiercely threw the wooden carving out of the window before firing out a stream of purple flames, shattering the wooden carving in the air into bits. After wiping his hands furiously, Xiao Chen finally found a modicum of solace.\u201cMy goddess!\u201d the fatty exclaimed. He had rushed to the window and seen what had happened to the wooden carving. His face distorted into an expression of matchless grief and heartbreak.Xiao Chen could not be bothered with him. He only left behind a bank note and prepared to leave.\u201cBrother Xiao, don\u2019t go, don\u2019t be in such a hurry to leave.\u201d Albeit having stood by the window earlier, Jin Dabao suddenly arrived in front of Xiao Chen in a flash. His face was wreathed in smiles as he tightly held onto Xiao Chen.Xiao Chen wanted to fling aside his hand, but he found that this fellow was not just heavy in an ordinary sense. In a situation such as this where Xiao Chen did not use his Essence, he was completely unable to move Jin Dabao at all.The helpless Xiao Chen could only stop resisting, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t even think of getting me to carve that for you, I will not agree to it.\u201dJin Dabao beamed as he said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, that\u2019s fine. Even if business talks fall through, we can still be friends. I feel that we have an affinity to each other. I would like to treat you to some wine, is that fine? Let\u2019s go to the fourth floor.\u201d\u201cMy treat!\u201d The fatty patted his chest as he said boldly.Xiao Chen was pestered by him to the point where he had no other choice, adding, \u201cWe only drink, no business talks. After the drink is done, I\u2019m leaving.\u201dJin Dabao let go gleefully, \u201cNot a problem, not a problem. Come! Let us go to the fourth floor immediately. It is more peaceful there.\u201dXiao Chen slowly followed him to the stairs. What surprised Xiao Chen was that the three cultivators of Liushang Pavilion standing in front of the stairs had extremely respectful expressions on their face when they saw the fatty.Unobstructed, they had a smooth passage to the fourth floor. The fourth floor of Liushang Pavilion was different from how Xiao Chen had imagined it would be; the decorations were very simple,\u00a0and there were no extravagant furnishings.However, the simple decorations did not give off a monotonous and dull feeling. Instead, it caused people to feel refreshed, putting them in a happy mood.\u201cDing dong, ding dong!\u201dFrom behind a screen on the fourth floor, there was a melodious sound coming from a zither. It was like the song of a nightingale fresh from the forest, or the tender twittering of a fledgling swallow returning to its nest. It was like the noise of heavy rain for a moment, and then... it petered out into a quiet whisper.It started like a thunderstorm and then ended on a mournful tone.The splendid music of the zither caused Xiao Chen, who knew nothing about music, to be enchanted. The mellow music matched the elegant decorations of the fourth floor, unwittingly entrancing its listeners.Xiao Chen opened his mouth, giving words of praise, \u201cThe decorations of the fourth floor are truly a great work of skill. All of it is extremely elegant and must have been done by an expert.\u201dWhen Jin Dabao heard this, he felt great in his heart. He elegantly opened that folding fan made of gold and fanned himself for a bit. Smiling, he said, \u201cThe humble me is not that talented. Thank you for your praises, Brother Xiao. The decorations of the fourth floor were designed by me. All the branches of Liushang Pavilion in the nation are laid out like this.\u201dXiao Chen was speechless, as he could not establish a connection between this fatty and the elegance of the fourth floor. After a long time, he said, \u201cPretend I never said that.\u201dLead by Jin Dabao, the two of them made their way to a table by the railings. The\u00a0field of view\u00a0here was very wide, and they could clearly see the people walking on the street.\u201cWaiter! Bring two bottles of good wine, as well as some side dishes. Oh, and a bowl of fish porridge, too,\u201d Jin Dabao immediately shouted out after he took a seat.The efficiency of the Liushang Pavilion\u2019s service was very high. It took but a moment for the waiter to provide them with all of their side dishes. Jin Dabao had a fragrant bowl of fish porridge placed in front of him.When Xiao Bai caught whiff of the fragrant smell, it immediately jumped onto the table and made a dash for the fish porridge. Jin Dabao found the little fox to be interesting and stretched out his\u00a0hand\u00a0to pat its head.With a quick flash, Xiao Bai evaded Jin Dabao\u2019s plump hand. It used both claws to slowly push the bowl of fish porridge towards Xiao Chen, and it even raised its head to roll its eyes at Jin Dabao.Jin Dabao was actually looked down upon by Xiao Bai, He laughed somewhat awkwardly and took a mouthful of wine before saying to Xiao Chen, \u201cBrother Xiao Chen, you have a pair of miraculous hands! I have a plan for us to get rich. As long as you cooperate, we will immediately be rolling in money.\u201dXiao Chen nodded his head with some interest. \u201cTell me more.\u201dFatty Jin chuckled as he vulgarly moved closer to Xiao Chen\u2019s ears and unraveled his plan to Xiao Chen in a soft voice. When Xiao Chen heard it, he could not help but smile bitterly,\u00a0\u201cI now realize that you\u2019re as gutsy as you are fat... no, perhaps to a greater degree.\u201dFatty Jin chuckled, \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t say anything and I don\u2019t say anything, who would know it was done by the two of us.\u201dXiao Chen was just about to reject when a manservant ran over and said to Xiao Chen, \u201cDear guest, the customer at that table has requested for your presence.\u201dLooking in the direction of his finger, Xiao Chen saw that the group of people the manservant was talking about were Jiang Muheng, Duanmu Qing, and\u00a0the others.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who do you think I am?\u00a0Xiao Chen thought coldly in his heart.Xiao Chen wanted to ignore him, but when he saw that the manservant did not leave he asked, \u201cWho asked you to pass on the message?\u201dThe manservant replied honestly, \u201cThe First Young Master of the Jiang Clan. Young Master Jiang Muheng said he wanted to invite you over for some wine and introduce you to his friends.\u201dXiao Chen picked up his cup and drained it in one gulp. He said indifferently, \u201cTell him to come over himself. Honestly, I do not actually know him.\u201dThe manservant revealed an unsightly expression; he did not know what to do. If he passed on this message, those people would definitely be upset at him. Furthermore, those people were not the kind of people who ought to be provoked.Fatty Jin laughed, \u201cSince when are the people of Liushang Pavilion so gutless? Just follow the instructions of this brother and pass on the message exactly as he said it.\u201dSince Fatty Jin said something, the manservant had no other choice but to do as he was told.This fatty truly has bad intentions. He is clearly helping himself, trying to quietly stir up conflicts between myself and them,\u00a0Xiao Chen thought to himself. However, he did not mind this since Jiang Muheng did not respect him. There was no need for Xiao Chen to belittle himself.Fatty Jin raised his cup and toasted Xiao Chen, \u201cBrother Xiao, you are very bold. Do you know who those people are?\u201dXiao Chen said indifferently, \u201cTell me the details.\u201dFatty Jin raised his cup and then pointed at one of them, \u201cThat is Duanmu Qing, her clan is the top Noble Clan in Sishui Prefecture. They are one of the three powers of Dongming Province and have an innate bloodline. Their hereditary Martial Spirit is the Ice Phoenix; it has already been passed down for thousands of years.\u201d\u201cThe male sitting to her right is Hua Yunfei. The Hua Noble Clan is also one of the three powers of Dongming Province. Their clan\u2019s Martial Spirit is a gushing holy river. However, his Martial Spirit had a mutation. The holy river turned into a horrifying blood river.\u201d\u201cThe last one is even more terrifying; he is the last disciple of the Misty Sword Sect Master, Chu Chaoyun. Haha! I suppose I do not have to introduce the Misty Sword Sect, since they have existed for even longer than the Holy Lands.\u201d\u201cHowever, the most frightening is not one of these people. Instead, it is that fellow called Jiang Muheng; he is from the Bai Clan, the strongest power in White Water City. As they said, it is better to deal with King Yama than the little demons. You did not give him face in front of these people; with his character\u2026 haha!\u201d[TL notes: It is better to deal with King Yama than the little demons: this means that the lackeys are even more difficult to deal with. According to Chinese folklore, King Yama is the one in hell.]The meaning of Jin Dabao\u2019s final two laughs was obvious. Xiao Chen was very clear on the consequences of offending that lackey. However, he had the ability to protect himself and was not afraid.He only had a few doubts in his heart,\u00a0Why did the younger generation of the three powers of Dongming Province come to White Water City?\u00a0Xiao Chen asked, \u201cYou should know why this group of people are here, right?\u201dFatty Jin fanned himself and put on an appearance of knowing what was going on. He smiled, \u201cIt would be useless to tell you. Aside from Jiang Muheng, all of them have already surmounted the Martial Master Realm and are already Martial Grand Masters. With your current cultivation level, it is best you do not know.\u201dFatty Jin stopped halfway through; it was clear that he was trying entice Xiao Chen to continue asking him, then pretending that he was put on the spot and had no other choice but to divulge what he knew. He wanted Xiao Chen to owe him a favor.Although Xiao Chen was curious, it was not to the point where he had to know at any cost. Furthermore, it was clear that this fatty was no ordinary person. Thinking of the plan he mentioned earlier, Xiao Chen felt it was better that he did not mix with him too much. Who knows? He might die as a result of this fatty and would not even know about it.Seeing that Xiao Bai already had its fill, he smiled faintly in his heart and prepared to take his leave.\u201cThis brother, do you dare to state your name?\u201d just as Xiao Chen was about to say something, Jiang Muheng led two servants over, walking with a gloomy face.Xiao Chen took a look behind him and discovered that the group seated at the table across had already finished their meal. Duanmu Qing and the other two had already left. He thought about it for a moment and guessed Jiang Muheng\u2019s motive.Since they had already left, Jiang Muheng no longer needed to maintain his previous elegant demeanor.Seeing that Xiao Chen did not immediately answer Jiang Muheng\u2019s question, a cultivator behind him pointed at Xiao Chen and said, \u201cHow arrogant! You did not even give our Young Master face when he invited you over to have a drink. Who do you think you are? Looking down on the Jiang Clan of White Water City.\u201dXiao Chen got up and formed a fist with his right hand; it gave off a reserved purple light. Without saying any useless words or wasting any time, he directly punched the chest of this cultivator.With a loud bang, the purple light burst out fiercely and a huge force knocked the servant flying back. The servant kept trying to grab onto something with his hands, but he was not able to do so.\u201cBang!\u201dThe servant landed on a table, smashing it into two halves. However, the huge force did not weaken, and the servant continued to roll on the floor before finally crashing into the wall. He vomited a mouthful of blood before fainting.Xiao Chen dusted his hands off and stared at Jiang Muheng. He smiled indifferently, \u201cMy apologies. When a dog barks at me, I will always take action instead of trying to reason with it. Let me answer your question now. My name is Xiao Chen. It\u2019s the Xiao with a grass \u2018head\u2019 and the Chen of Morning.\u201d[TL note: Sometimes in China, when introducing their names, people will explain which chinese characters make up their name, as there are many characters that have the same sound. In this case, the Xiao is written as \u8427; the grass head refers to the top of the character for grass \u8349. You will notice that they share the same \u2018top\u2019 or \u2018head\u2019. As for Chen \u6668, morning in chinese is Zao Chen \u65e9\u6668.]\u201cGoodbye!\u201d Xiao Chen leaped over the fourth floor railing once he said that, directly jumping out. When the Spirit Fox on the table saw that Xiao Chen had left, it hurriedly jumped after him.When Xiao Chen saw that Xiao Bai jumped after him, he was startled. He immediately turned his body over in midair and caught the Spirit Fox, hugging it. He scolded it, \u201cYou jumped when I jumped... Are you not afraid of falling to death?\u201dXiao Chen carried the Spirit Fox and took a deep breath, before leaping in mid air and landing on the roof of a house. The total distance he vaulted down was about a hundred meters. After a few more bounds, he disappeared from the crowd\u2019s view.\u201cBrother Xiao, you still have not told me if you agree to my plan?!\u201d Fatty Jin leaned on the railing and shouted towards the distant Xiao Chen in a loud voice.Jiang Muheng punched out suddenly, his fist landing on the table where Xiao Chen was drinking at earlier. The table immediately broke into four pieces, and the tableware shattered with tinkling sounds upon hitting the ground.After the customers on the fourth floor saw what happened, they were no longer in the mood to continue eating. They threw down stacks of banknotes and left after they paid their bills.Jiang Muheng stood where he was with an ashen complexion; as he watched Xiao Chen leave, his eyes were full of anger. He had\u00a0never seen anyone so arrogant in White Water City before.How dare he actually injure his man in front of him and then calmly report his name, before leaving immediately? The people on the fourth floor were all of some status in White Water City. Probably by the next day the entire White Water City would see him as a joke.\u201cFirst Young Master, you have to take revenge for me!\u201d The servant in the corner woke up in a dazed state; he was not clear on the current situation and grumbled as he walked with a tremble towards Jiang Muheng\u2019s side.\u201cBang!\u201dJiang Muheng was currently angry, and he raised his leg to kick the servant away.\u00a0He scolded himself ruthlessly, \u201cYou trash! You caused me to lose all my face.\u201dJiang Muheng turned around, wanting to leave this place immediately; he wanted to use his clan\u2019s spies to find out Xiao Chen\u2019s place of residence. He wished he could hack Xiao Chen into thousands of pieces immediately.\u201cYoung Master Jiang, please wait for a bit. It seems that you have not paid your bill yet,\u201d Fatty Jin blocked Jiang Muheng with a gleeful face.Jiang Muheng could not be bother with him and just took out a wad of banknotes, throwing it on the floor. Fatty Jin took a quick look and smiled, \u201cYoung Master Jiang, the amount does not seem to be correct. Take a look. You have damaged two of my tables and chased away all the guests on the fourth floor. 3000 taels of silver would not be enough!\u201dJiang Muheng looked at Jin Dabao in disdain and took out a few gold banknotes, throwing them angrily on the floor before trampling on them before cursing out, \u201cDamn fatty!\u00a0Is that enough?!\u201dJin Dabao saw the gold banknotes, and his eyes lit up. His eyes narrowed as he said, \u201cThat is definitely enough, Young Master Jiang is indeed Young Master Jiang.\u00a0This amount is a huge sum! Take care! I will not send you off further. You are welcome to come and smash my tables again.\u201d\u201cAh! Look at my mouth. I start rambling when I get happy. Don\u2019t be angry; I meant we welcome Young Master Jiang to come back for a meal.\u201dJin Dabao did not mind Jiang Muheng\u2019s mockings at all. He only knelt down and happily picked up the banknotes on the floor, piece by piece. Every time he picked up a piece, the expression on his face seemed as though he became more and more drunk.\u201cYoung Master, let me pick them up. This shameless chore is not befitting of your status,\u201d a manservant of Liushang Pavilion said, after he could no longer bear to continue watching.Jin Dabao pushed aside the manservant, saying, \u201cGo to the side. Do you not see that I am enjoying myself? Not everyone can meet a foolish spendthrift who is willing to compensate ten thousand taels of silver for two tables, like I did. Haha!\u201dThe sounds of the\u00a0zither\u00a0on the fourth floor had stopped at an unknown time. From behind the screens a young girl in a pink dress walked out leisurely, carrying a zither.She was a beautiful woman, with her hair tied into a bun at the top of her head and fastened with a hair pin; her skin was as white as snow, and it seemed so fragile that even the wind could break it. These things made her seem incomparably fresh and pure. However, when she walked over leisurely, a flirtatious expression appeared on her naturally. It was very charming, making her look tender, beautiful, and alluring.When Fatty Jin saw this girl, he immediately stopped picking up the money. He immediately leaped over. If Xiao Chen was here, he would definitely have the same impression of a male pig in heat.\u201cMiss Xiaoxiao, I did not expect that you would be here. Dabao missed you so much!\u201d Fatty Jin\u2019s plump body was moving fast, as though he was flying. He spread open his arms and ran toward the girl. If Xiao Chen saw this, he would blush with shame.\u201cDang!\u201dThe seven-stringed zither in Xiaoxiao\u2019s embrace moved forward slightly, stopping on the fatty\u2019s lower jaw. Fatty Jin immediately covered his mouth in pain, kneeling on the ground.Xiaoxiao hugged her zither as she looked at the fatty on the ground. Smiling coldly, she said, \u201cFatty Jin, you really do not change your ways. Always using the same moves every time.\u201dFatty Jin stood up gleefully. Unfortunately, his lower jaw was now swollen. His originally vulgar look actually managed to turn even more vulgar when he smiled.\u201cFortunately, this fatty has hard teeth. Otherwise, if I were jabbed by you like this every time I would have lost all my teeth.\u201d After Fatty Jin got up, he shamelessly laughed.As he spoke, he unconsciously walked to Xiaoxiao\u2019s side and placed a fat hand on her tiny shoulder. Xiaoxiao was currently looking in the direction where Xiao Chen had just left; it seemed as though she did not notice the fatty\u2019s actions.The fatty\u2019s heart rate sped up several times; this goddess was right in front of him, and he could finally touch her. The fat on his face quivered.\u201cHu!\u201dXiaoxiao suddenly turned around, and the seemingly ordinary zither headed towards the fatty\u2019s face. A strong wind followed it as it ruthlessly struck towards him. The fatty was startled and quickly ducked to evade.Seeing Xiaoxiao glaring angrily at him, the fatty straightened himself and smiled, \u201cI could not help myself. Every time I see Miss Xiaoxiao there is this impulse in me. This is a normal reaction for men. Miss Xiaoxiao, please do not pay any mind to it.\u201dImpulse my ass, how can there be someone as shameless as you?\u00a0Xiaoxiao scolded the fatty furiously in her heart ten thousand times. However, she knew that with the fatty\u2019s thick skin, the more you scolded him, the more smug became. The best method was to just ignore him.Xiaoxiao looked around for a clean table before she took a seat and said, \u201cDamn fatty, how is that youth from earlier related to you?\u201dWhen the fatty heard this, he was startled and extremely astonished. He said in an incredibly serious tone, \u201cCould it be that your Elder Brother Jin, alone, is insufficient to satisfy you? Xiaoxiao, your appetite is too big.\u201d\u201cCa!\u201dXiaoxiao could no longer resist any more, so she slapped the zither with her palm. The zither rose into the air and caused a Qi wave to smash ruthlessly into the fatty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He evaded toward the side, revealing a speed that did not match with his body.\u201cHu!\u201dThe zither attacked incessantly, and with a boom, it created a hole the size of a bowl in the wooden walls of Liushang Pavilion. The walls of Liushang Pavilion were made from Peak Grade sandalwood. An entire wooden plank of it would cost thousands of taels of gold.When the fatty saw such a big hole, his heart bled. He ran to the front of the hole and measured the size of it with his hands, trying to calculate how much money he had lost.\u201cDamn! I lost at least half the money I just picked up,\u201d the fatty cried out in agony after he measured the size of the hole.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe zither, which had already flown out earlier, flew back in with a \u2018shua\u2019 sound. This time, it did so with a larger force, creating another hole in the wall.The fatty was incredibly heartbroken; he said in a hoarse voice, \u201cCrap! There goes the other half\u2026 Seems like I did not earn anything today in the end.\u201dThe zither returned to Xiaoxiao\u2019s hands once again before she took a seat on a bench. Her eyes were closed and a drunk expression could be seen on her pure white face as she caressed the strings of the zither gently.\u201cDing!\u201dShe suddenly opened her eyes and both her hands rapidly plucked the zither strings. An impassioned melody of a powerful army struggling in a battlefield suddenly rang out. Its volume slowly became louder, and very soon it pulled everyone into a fired up state, as if they were in a battlefield.\u201cTong! Tong! Tong!\u201dStreams of sound waves spread out in all directions as the zither string rang out. The fatty thought silently in his heart,\u00a0Crap! My mouth created trouble for me again.Just as he thought that, all the antique porcelain used as decoration on the fourth floor began shattering. Not a single piece managed to escape.At the end, the zither sounds gradually grew even louder as the killing intent got heavier. Aside from the table that Su Xiaoxiao sat at, everything on the fourth floor soared up into the air.\u201cBang!\u201dSu Xiaoxiao finished the melody on a heavy note, causing all the table and chairs in the air to shatter. Countless amounts of sawdust were scattered in the air, settling down only after a long time.The fatty\u2019s face, which usually had a smile on it, was currently drained of blood, looking very pale. It seemed as though he might collapse at any time; it was extremely funny.A manservant at the side hurried over to support him. He said in a soft voice, \u201cYoung Master, don\u2019t be too upset. When the manager knew that Miss Su Xiaoxiao would be coming, he guessed that you would definitely anger her. So he replaced all the antiques with counterfeits in advance.\u201dThe fatty\u2019s eyes opened wide as he said, \u201cReally? The manager understands me really well.\u201d\u201cReally.\u201dWhen Fatty Jin heard this, his spirits lifted up and the smile returned to his face. However, he still had a bitter expression, \u201cThe others are fake, but the two holes are definitely very real. There is no way for that to be fake. In the end, I still made a loss!\u201d\u201cDamn Fatty! Still not coming over?\u201d Su Xiaoxiao put aside the zither and scolded him. Her mood had only improved after causing all this destruction.Fatty Jin did not dare to throw any tantrums and hurriedly rushed over. His face was full of smiles as he said, \u201cMiss Xiaoxiao, what orders do you have for me? This Fat Brother will guarantee your satisfaction.\u201dSu Xiaoxiao frowned slightly and glared at him, \u201cThat youth from earlier, how is he related to you?\u201dThe fatty did not dare to run his mouth this time and replied honestly, \u201cI just met him today and wanted to do some business with him. I only know his name is Xiao Chen and do not know any other details.\u201dXiao Chen?\u00a0When Su Xiaoxiao heard this name, she thought of a certain possibility. A smile immediately appeared on her face; this careless smile was like flowers blossoming; nothing more beautiful can be imagined. When the fatty at her side saw this, he was dumbstruck.When Su Xiaoxiao saw the fatty\u2019s foolish appearance, she could not help but feel disdain in her heart. She asked, \u201cHow much do you know about the ancient remains that the Bai Clan talked about?\u201dJin Dabao recovered his wits and replied, \u201cI know a little about it. The Bai Clan\u2019s people obtained a map of an ancient treasure site, but they did not have the strength to enter. So they invited the three great powers of Dongming Province to explore the ancient remains together.\u201d\u201cHowever, someone in the Bai Clan leaked the information. So this news was spread to everyone. The great powers of Xihe Province and Nanling Province also sent people to rush over. Even the Imperial Court sent someone to come over.\u201dSu Xiaoxiao was astonished in her heart. The allure of the remains left by the ancient powers was too great. It seemed like it would be difficult for her to attempt to benefit from this.West of White Water City, In a Small Isolated Courtyard:A sturdy wooden pole stood upright in the courtyard. Xiao Chen grasped his Lunar Shadow Saber tightly and focused on\u00a0looking\u00a0\u00a0at the wooden pole, raising his aura to the extreme.\u201cChi!\u201d \u201cDrawing the Saber!\u201dXiao Chen\u2019s expression changed, and he suddenly unsheathed the Lunar Shadow Saber. He struck the wooden pole at an inclined angle, and a section of the wooden pole that was as thick as his arm was sliced off.\u201cShua! Shua! Shua!\u201dXiao Chen quickly hacked out three more times. When the fourth strike landed, the wooden pole wobbled for a little before it went crashing to the ground.It was just four simple saber strikes, but Xiao Chen\u2019s forehead was covered in sweat. He wiped the sweat off and muttered to himself, \u201cIt\u2019s still insufficient. It has already been half a month, yet there is no progress.\u201dThis small isolated courtyard was purchased by Xiao Chen after he came to White Water City. After he settled down, he immediately started to review all the Martial Techniques and Immortal Spells that he had learned. He realized that the things he had learned were too varied and messy.He decided to retrain himself and not rush to restore his cultivation back to Inferior Grade Martial Master from Superior Grade Martial Disciple. He figured that he might as well use this opportunity to strengthen his foundations.All the Martial Techniques he developed using the Battle Sage Origin\u2019s Changing Character Formula were temporarily pushed to the side, focusing on the truths that were contained in the Battle Sage Origin\u2019s Changing Character Formula.He now saw that he had not even begun to understand the essence of it and had only scratched its surface. He was not able to use it as though it was a part of himself.After using those techniques for a long period of time, with his current cultivation, he found that it was doing more harm than good to him. In the long run, it would cause him to thoroughly lose himself, lost in these Martial Techniques that came from foreign sources.Thus, he wanted to focus on the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique and Azure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art. He cultivated the Azure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art in a quiet place in the Savage Forest.As for the cultivation of the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique, there were no major requirements for it. Thus, whenever he came back to rest, he would go into the yard to practice.The Rushing Thunder Saber Technique was about doing everything in one breath, to raise the aura to the extreme, and use the Rushing Thunder Chop as the initiating move. The accumulated energy would be released out explosively.This was an extremely bold and powerful Martial Technique. If he could execute it all the way up to the Rushing Thunder Third Chain Chop, the explosive energy would be raised to the peak and then increased by many folds before finally exceeding a regular Earth Rank Martial Technique.However, he discovered that this Saber Technique had a fatal flaw\u2014the first strike. If it was unable to cause the opponent to retreat, then the techniques that followed could not be executed anymore.The aura would be used up and could not be used to form the following techniques.Xiao Chen thought of the swordsmen of Ancient China from his previous life. He felt that their methods of training Saber Techniques made sense, so he decided to follow their methods to practice in this world.This wooden pole that stood upright may be as thick as an arm, but it was actually very light. It was a special wood of the Tianwu Continent. With just the strength required to move a feather, it was possible to move it.Within this extremely short period of time, what Xiao Chen wanted to do was to be able to rapidly cut the wooden pole, but the wooden pole had to still remain standing. What appeared to be a simple saber strike actually exhausted a large amount of his concentration.Of the slightly more than one month\u2019s time that he spent in White Water City, Xiao Chen spent most of it practicing the first move of the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique\u2014Drawing the Saber. Every day, the number of times he brandished his saber numbered at least a thousand.Initially, the moment he touched the wooden pole, it would fall. Slowly, he became able to hack at it once. Then he was able to continuously execute four saber strikes. From that point on, his progress became stagnant.Shaking his head, Xiao Chen erected the wooden pole once again and continued to practice the first move of the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique. Unwittingly, the sun above his head had sank to the west.The sunset dyed the clouds that filled the sky red, turning the entire sky a fiery color. Xiao Chen continued to repeat the same action tirelessly; he did not even notice as time flowed by.Only after the sky turned completely dark did Xiao Chen stop what he was doing. His shirt was completely wet with sweat, and the soreness of his arms was all he felt.Without resting immediately, Xiao Chen sat down on the ground cross-legged and entered into a state of cultivation. When the body reached its limits, if one cultivated then, they would often experience an unexpected result.After an hour, the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation had circulated for many cycles in Xiao Chen\u2019s body. Suddenly, he opened his eyes. The sweat in his body had already entirely evaporated into steam, the blood in his body was boiling, and the soreness in his arms completely vanished.\u201cHu!\u201dXiao Chen got up, took a long breath out, and stretched his arm out. In a split second, all the bones in his body gave off crackling sounds. After all these, he felt a very comfortable and invigorating feeling.\u201cPu!\u201dXiao Bai, who had been standing on the stone table all the while, quickly jumped down when it saw that Xiao Chen had completed his cultivation. Its eyes were filled with intelligence and gave off a gleam in the night, as it rushed towards Xiao Chen\u2019s embrace.Xiao Chen smiled faintly and picked it up. After he teased it for a bit, he put it away in the Spirit Blood Jade.Just as Xiao Chen prepared to go to sleep, a faint killing intent came from the distance. Xiao Chen frowned and extended out his Spiritual Sense in the direction of the killing intent.In the dark of night, a human shadow holding a broad saber leaped from roof to roof, heading towards Xiao Chen\u2019s courtyard rapidly.When Xiao Chen saw the person\u2019s face clearly, he smiled coldly to himself. This person was Jiang Muheng\u2019s other servant, the person who claimed he could kill Xiao Chen with one palm.The power of the Jaing Clan was indeed great in White Water City. Before even half a day had passed, they had actually managed to find the place where he stayed. It seemed like he would not be able to stay here long term.Seeing that human figure come closer, Xiao Chen slowly moved to a corner of the\u00a0wall\u00a0close to the door. He withdrew the aura of his body completely, and the black Lunar Shadow Saber could not be seen in the dark of night.\u201cDong!\u201dThe human figure jumped from the roof and landed firmly on Xiao Chen\u2019s courtyard wall. He did not come down in a rush, and released his perception.He felt that it was strange he could not sense anyone in the courtyard. He muttered to himself, \u201cCould it be that the information was wrong? No, that can\u2019t be right. It perhaps this kid has not returned yet. I will go down and hide myself.\u201d\u201cDrawing The Sword!\u201dIn the instant he jumped down, a resplendent electrical light suddenly lit up in the darkness of night. A saber light carrying a peerless aura moved quickly and gracefully. Before the man could react to it, his body was chopped in two halves.This saber strike was strangely incredibly fast, and even though the man\u2019s body was cut into two halves, it did not separate in the air immediately; he did not even feel any pain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the next instant, he revealed a horrifying expression as he looked at his own legs running.He turned his head around; the instant the electrical light faded, he saw Xiao Chen's ice cold gaze.Xiao Chen fired out a stream of purple flames and burned the body to ashes. After that, he packed up some stuff in his room and immediately left the courtyard.The next morning, Xiao Chen came out of a desolate inn. He was wearing a black cloak, shrouding his entire body in shadows as he slowly made his way to Liushang Pavilion.A get-up like Xiao Chen's was not too strange amongst cultivators. Thus, when he walked over to Liushang Pavilion, it did not attract anyone's attention.He casually found an empty table and took a seat. Xiao Chen called the waiter over, \"Please get your boss to come over. Tell him there is some business for him.\"The waiter looked at Xiao Chen and found it funny,\u00a0Can the boss of Liushang Pavilion simply be seen by anyone when they want to?\"My apologies, our guest. I believe that you do not understand our rules.\"Xiao Chen smiled faintly and took out a 500 silver taels banknote, as well as a wooden carving. He handed them to the waiter saying, \"Please do me this favor and run this errand. When your boss sees this wooden carving, he will not blame you.\"The waiter opened his eyes wide in glee as he received the silver banknotes, \"Esteemed guest is a frank and straightforward person. I will go now, but I can't say for sure if the boss will see you or not.\"Xiao Chen picked up the tea cup on the table and gently took a sip. Smiling as he said, \"That's fine, so long as you report the results to me. Whether it succeeds or not, I will not blame you.\"Not long after the waiter left, the heavy footsteps of Jin Dabao could be heard coming from the second floor. Seeing Xiao Chen's get-up, he was secretly astonished before he came running over gleefully, \"Brother Xiao, why are you dressed up like this? Are you on the run? If you are, you can come and find me. I have my ways. Where do you want to go? Just name it.\"Xiao Chen said nothing; his right hand, which was holding the teacup, suddenly made a move and with a 'shua' sound he grabbed the wooden carving in the fatty's hands back. He placed the wooden carving down, and then he grabbed the teacup that was slowly falling.Jin Dabao's eyes narrowed and carefully evaluated Xiao Chen. He was astonished in his heart. He did not expect that Xiao Chen would be so fast when he made his move. He was carelessly caught off guard.Xiao Chen put the teacup down and said indifferently, \"Brother Dabao, you don't have to worry about the matter of me being on the run. I am only here to talk business. I am a straightforward person. I only have one question for you... Are you willing or not?\"Jin Dabao had a smile on his face again, \"Of course! Why not?\"Xiao Chen said, \"Then let's talk about the details. The wooden carving you saw the last time... I will not be carving that again. The carving that I would cooperate with you on is the one you just saw.\"Fatty Jin frowned and said in a manner that seemed like he was somewhat put on the spot, \"I say, Brother Xiao, for these two wooden carvings, the difference in price for with and without the additional clothes is not just one or two times.\"\"Then we are at an impasse. I have my bottom line. I will not sell the carving of Princess Ying Yue with just her bra on. Goodbye,\" Xiao Chen got up, and then proceeded to walk toward the door.Fatty Jin hurriedly got up and held Xiao Chen back. Smiling, he said, \"Brother Xiao, don't be in such a rush. Did I reject it? I was deliberating on the price. Sit down and talk. Please sit.\"Xiao Chen smiled to himself in his heart; he had anticipated that this fatty would be tempted by this transaction. He had accurately guessed that Jin Dabao would not let him leave just like that. When dealing with such calculative people, he could not take his conscience into account. He had to show off his strong side, or else he would be the one suffering a disadvantage.Seeing that Xiao Chen sat down once again, Fatty Jin said, \"Brother Xiao, how about this? You are a very straightforward person, so I will not beat around the bush. We will follow the plan mentioned previously. You supply the goods, and I'll handle the sales. After that, we will split the profits 30-70 in my favor.\"Xiao Chen thought for a while, \"I do not like the way profit is split. It takes too long for money to come in. Just state a price; how much would you be willing to purchase a wooden carving for?\"Fatty Jin muttered to himself irresolutely before saying, \"How about one hundred taels of gold per wooden carving?\"Xiao Chen was astonished. To think that he could sell it for such an expensive price. One hundred taels of gold was equivalent to ten thousand taels of silver. The cost of making the wooden carving was almost negligible. The profit margin was way higher than what Xiao Chen expected.The silver taels that he currently had on him were obtained in Linlang Pavilion by selling the Fasting Pills. It was a much more complicated process to refine medicine; in comparison, creating wooden carvings was a lot easier.In the introduction of the Life Bestowal Spell in the Compendium of Cultivation, it had some specific records on making wooden carvings; Xiao Chen's carving skills came from there.In this world, where the martial way reigned supreme, there were very few people who would venture into and research auxiliary skills like this. Xiao Chen's handiwork was unique in this world.He originally wanted to reject Fatty Jin's proposal, but after the assassination attempt last night, he felt a sense of urgency in his heart.The path of cultivation required a large amount of money. Not to mention expensive medicinal pills, good armor, and Spirit Weapons alone would require a cultivator to pay a huge price.One of the important reasons why the disciples of the huge noble clans cultivated faster than the rest was because they had access to good medicinal pills and quality equipment.Although Xiao Chen could earn money from refining medicinal pills, he was still unable to refine any high grade ones. Furthermore, the process of refining medicinal pills also required a large influx of money.Also, Xiao Chen intended to refine more equipment in future. That required a large amount of money as well, so he was actually very much in need of money.When Fatty Jin saw that Xiao Chen did not say anything, he thought that the price he quoted was too low. He said, \"Brother Xiao, are you not satisfied with this price? This is already the best price I can give you. I am not taking advantage of you; this is the highest I can go.\"Xiao Chen recovered his wits and smiled, \"No that's not it. I was just a little astonished. How in the world are you selling it for you to be able to purchase it at such a high price?\"\"Shua!\"The gold folding fan in the fatty's hand opened quickly. Xiao Chen knew in his heart that when he did this action, it was time for him to start bragging.Indeed after the fatty fanned himself vigorously, he smiled cockily, \"Brother Xiao, you probably do not know, but this princess has a very strong influence in the Imperial Court and the Imperial Capital. It is not exaggerating to call her a goddess. Not only is her strength at the peak, she has the appearance of a fairy.\"\"This fatty has already noticed this long ago. Using this business opportunity, I have found people to write quite a few books on her. It could be said that every male within the Imperial Capital has a copy.\"\"Under the influence of these books, as well as some other inspiration, I had already thought of the idea of having wooden carvings long ago. Unfortunately, I could not find a craftsman suitable for the job. Thus, when I saw brother Xiao, I felt that there was an affinity between us. I have been searching for someone like you for a long time.\"Xiao Chen was secretly astonished in his heart,\u00a0This Fatty is truly a business genius, to think that he could devise such an innovative marketing method.After that, he suddenly thought of something. He asked in a probing manner, \"Brother Dabao, those books of yours\u2026 They are not erotic novels right?\"Fatty Jin smiled somewhat awkwardly, \"Those\u2026 ummm\u2026 they can't really be called erotic novels\u2026 I can only say that they are novels that have some romance and fantasy elements to them.\"Xiao Chen felt ashamed in his heart,\u00a0I knew it. This fatty would definitely not do it in a morally upright manner.\u00a0He asked somewhat worriedly, \"Are you not afraid that the Imperial Court will find out about you doing this?\"Fatty Jin smiled in a vulgar manner, \"There is no need to worry about this at all. The officer in charge of investigating this has some dealings with me. We even privately discussed some of the details of the novels. The novels we have are serialized; if he closed us down, he would no longer be able to read them.\"Xiao Chen had to admire him from the bottom of his heart this time. He took out the wooden carvings that he had made previously and handed them over to Fatty Jin, \"I had made these in the past. There should be about a hundred of them. Give me a price!\"Fatty Jin said nothing, an excited smile filling his face as he took every wooden carving and carefully inspected them, one by one. He looked very serious as he did this.On the fourth floor of Liushang Pavilion, Jiang Muheng and Duanmu Qing were seated at a table alone.Jiang Muheng smiled elegantly, \"Miss Duanmu, I have already made a deal with that owner of the Spirit Fox. My servant has already gone to retrieve the goods. He should be sending them to you anytime now.\"Duanmu Qing smiled mildly, \"How much did you spend? I will pay you double. I will not let you suffer any disadvantages.\"Seeing the hard to come by smile of Duanmu Qing, the joy on Jiang Muheng's face deepened, \"I did not spend much. Miss Duanmu doesn't have to bother with that. As long as you are happy.\"Duanmu Qing was mildly startled, \"That person from yesterday wanted a Heaven Ranked Spirit Weapon before he was willing to sell it. Young Master Jiang, did you play any underhanded tricks?\"Jiang Muheng panicked in his heart. He said in a serious manner, \"Miss Duanmu, although my clan has some power in White Water City, normally I would not bully someone. Furthermore, with Miss Duanmu around, if I did any such things, wouldn't that be equal to me looking down on the Duanmu Clan?\"Duanmu Qing found this funny in her heart, but she did not say anything. The two of them continued to wait, but after a long time the servant that Jiang Muheng mention did not arrive.\"I think something must have happened. Let's talk about this another day. I shall be leaving first,\" Duanmu Qing finally lost patience and headed down the stairs.Jiang Muheng scolded the servant ruthlessly in his heart. Throwing out a stack of silver taels banknotes, he chased after her.Jiang Muheng chased her all the way to the second floor before finally catching up. He hurriedly shouted out in a loud voice, \"Miss Duanmu, let me explain.\"Duanmu Qing Stopped walking and said politely, \"Young Master Jiang, there is nothing to explain. This is not some important matter, you don't have to worry about it.\"Seeing Duanmu Qing's expression, Jiang Muheng knew that his plan had backfired. He could not help but to feel anxious.Just at that moment, Fatty Jin had finished counting all the hundred wooden carvings. He put them aside with a happy expression and took out a stack of gold taels banknotes. He said, \"Brother Xiao, please count it.\"Xiao Chen immediately put aside all the banknotes and got up, \"There is no need to count, it was good doing business with you. When I have more, I will bring them to you.\"Just as he turned, he coincidentally met Jiang Muheng's gaze. When Jiang Muheng saw Xiao Chen, dressed in a black cloak, an astonished look appeared on his face.\"Xiao Chen!\"After the astonishment, came boundless rage. Jiang Muheng found it completely unexpected that he would actually run into Xiao Chen here. He flew into a rage born of humiliation as he walked towards Xiao Chen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94:\u00a0Inherited Martial SpiritJiang Muheng did not expect to run into Xiao Chen here today. When he thought about the matters of the previous day, as well as what happened earlier, the old grudges added together with the new. Jiang Muheng could not hold back the anger he suppressed for a long time.Even with Duanmu Qing beside him, he could no longer be bothered to maintain his elegance. Only one thought remained in his head, which was to kill Xiao Chen on the spot, to make him pay for all the humiliation that he suffered.When Xiao Chen saw Jiang Muheng suddenly, he felt mildly astonished, as well. However, he calmed down almost immediately. He noticed Jiang Muheng did not bring any of his servants with him.\u201cYoung Master Jiang, we meet again,\u201d Xiao Chen had a faint smile on his face, there was no fear on it at all. Instead, it was like greeting an old friend. Xiao Chen was smiling as he headed over to him.Jiang Muheng cursed out at him, \u201cMeet your\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish cursing, he saw a black saber appear in Xiao Chen\u2019s hand. The position of Xiao Chen\u2019s feet shifted and he quickly took up a stance.\u201cDrawing The Saber!\u201dA saber light reflected in his eyes. Jiang Muheng had never seen such a quick saber before; neither had he seen such a tyrannical person. Who would \u00a0think that Xiao Chen actually dared to make a move on him in White Water City?In this critical moment of danger, he executed his strength as a Martial Master to its peak and retreated backward desperately. His quick movement saved his life; this saber did not hack him into two.And yet, there was a saber wound as deep as a finger on his chest. A stream of fresh blood spurted out into the air. The resulting force from the saber caused his body to fly backward.A large hole was torn in the chest of Jiang Muheng\u2019s shirt; a piece yellow paper drifted out of it. When Xiao Chen saw this, he quickly grabbed it.Jiang Muheng, who fell to the ground, wanted to stand up when he saw Xiao Chen grab the piece of paper. However, he discovered his wounds were too severe.Blood flowed out unceasingly, and he did not have any strength to even stand. He could not help but panic in his heart. He coughed blood into the air as he shouted, \u201cMiss Duanmu, that is the copy of the map to the ancient remains!. Do not let him keep it!\u201dWhen Duanmu Qing heard this, her face turned frosty. She waved both her hands and streams of cold Qi flowed behind her before they finally gathered in the middle of her hands.A palm filled with cold Qi smashed ruthlessly towards Xiao Chen. This opponent was very strong, so Xiao Chen did not dare to receive it head on. He pushed off the ground with his feet and his body soared into the air, launching down from the second floor.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe table behind Xiao Chen immediately turned into ice before it explosively shattered, turning into countless ice shards.What a tyrannical cold Qi. When the cultivators on the second floor witnessed the situation, they were completely astonished. They hurriedly paid their bills; they did not wish to be dragged into this battle for no reason at all.\u201cBang!\u201dWhen Duanmu Qing saw Xiao Chen descend to the first floor, she pushed off the wooden floor fiercely and her body immediately dropped to the first floor as well, landing beside Xiao Chen.\u201cDamn It! Are you trying to destroy my shop?\u201d when Fatty Jin saw the huge hole on the floor, he could not help but curse loudly.Once Duanmu Qing landed, she fired a stream of cold Qi at Xiao Chen\u2019s back. The cold Qi rapidly congealed in the air, taking the shape of a small bird.\u201cChi!\u201dDuanmu Qing formed a hand seal with both her hands and the Ice Phoenix Martial Spirit in her body cried out. The bird flew into the air and its eyes gleamed. Its size and speed immediately doubled.Xiao Chen instantly stopped moving as he felt a dangerous aura coming from behind him. His mind went blank as he recalled his normal state when practicing with the saber. He focused as his right hand grasped the lunar Shadow Saber tightly. His aura soared to its peak.\u201cDrawing The Saber!\u201dJust as the ice bird was behind Xiao Chen by half a meter, Xiao Chen suddenly spun around and made his move. The Saber gave off a reserved light and with a \u2018shua\u2019 sound, it split the ice bird in half right down the middle.Where the ice bird was split in half, one could see it was very smooth; there was no trace of bumps or roughness. Base on this, one could tell how fast this saber was.A trace of astonishment flashed in her heart, though her beautiful eyes had no trace of fright in them. There was no change in her facial expression.Following the instant Xiao Chen made his move, there was a flurry of movement and the doorway of Liushang Pavilion was choked up. The guests on the first floor were mostly ordinary citizens. When they saw Xiao Chen jump down from the second floor; they knew there was going to be a battle and they all settle their bills and ran.Duanmu Qing looked at Xiao Chen without expression as she said indifferently, \u201cHand over the map and I will not kill you.\u201dXiao Chen held onto his saber and stood straight, smiling coldly to himself. If an ordinary Superior Grade Martial Disciple was struck by the ice bird, Duanmu Qing\u2019s earlier attack, they would be dead, if not severely injured.Seeing that he was able to destroy the ice bird in one move, then saying she would not kill him, Xiao Chen could only say this girl\u2019s scheme was not ordinary.Xiao Chen said nothing. Instead, he raised his left hand into the air and five streams of purple fire formed in the sky. After revolving in a \u00a0circle, they were fired rapidly at Duanmu Qing.Duanmu Qing\u2019s face instantly turned frosty as she saw Xiao Chen did not know what was good for himself.\u00a0To think he actually made a move against me!\u00a0She snorted and the temperature around her dropped; a boundless cold Qi rose up from the ground.When the five streams of purple flames met the cold Qi, their speed immediately slowed. However, what surprised Duanmu Qing was that these five streams of flames did not immediately stop. Instead, they were like small fish, swimming forward slowly.Although their speed was slow, they would not retreat. With just a thought from Xiao Chen, the five streams of flames merged together, forming a single huge flame; its speed increased explosively.The cold Qi that filled the air could no longer stop the progress of the flame. The look in Duanmu Qing\u2019s black eyes became even more frigid. The cold Qi that was around her started to condense slowly.\u201cDrip! Drip!\u201dThe water droplets formed by the cold Qi continuously dripped on the wooden floor around Duanmu Qing. The water droplets rapidly gathered together and froze into hard ice.\u201cDang! Dang! Dang!\u201dThree ice walls formed from that piece of ice and appeared in front of Duanmu Qing. The purple flame smashed explosively through the first wall and continued on to the second.Xiao Chen\u2019s brain worked fast as lightning; after the purple flames smashed through the first ice wall, he could obviously feel the strength of the flame had been significantly reduced. He knew this flame would not deal any significant damage to Duanmu Qing.Since he was not able to gain any advantage, he had to leave. Once Xiao Chen made up his mind, he immediately headed to the nearest window. It was clearly ridiculous for a Superior Grade Marital Disciple to go against a Martial Grand Master.\u201cBang!\u201dAfter the purple flame smashed through the third wall, it immediately vanished into thin air. Duanmu Qing watched Xiao Chen rushing away; her gaze became even colder and her fine black hair fluttered in the air.\u201cIce!\u201dDuanmu Qing shouted and her shirt and long skirt started to flutter; her fine black black hair floated up. She spread her perception throughout the first floor of Liushang Pavilion. A violent cold Qi erupted out of her body.\u201cShua!\u201dEverything in the entire first floor was covered in two inches of thick ice. In an instant, the first floor became a shining ice palace.The originally open window had been covered by a thick layer of ice. Xiao Chen\u2019s rapidly moving body smashed violently against it with a loud bang. The ice did not even tremble. The backlash of smashing into the frozen barrier caused him to crash to the ground.He moved very fast when he was bounced back by the ice. All he felt now was the soreness of his shoulder.This was a innate bloodline? The power of of an inherited Martial Spirit?\u00a0Xiao Chen looking around the glittering environment. He thought to himself in astonishment, This was simply too horrifying.Duanmu Qing walked over slowly. Her hair turned completely white. Her glower turned cold; there was not a shred of emotion on her face.\u201cHand over the map and I will not kill you,\u201d she opened her mouth and said. As she spoke each word, the temperature of the ice palace plummeted further.The Purple Thunder Divine Incantation circulated rapidly within Xiao Chen\u2019s body, resisting the inexhaustible cold wind inside the ice palace.Just as Xiao Chen hesitated on whether he should hand over the map, Xiao Bai jumped out from the Spirit Blood Jade. It stood in front of Xiao Chen and took a deep breath. Its snow white belly bloated up and it spat out a white colored light ball.\u201cDamn it!\u201dXiao Chen cursed in his heart as he watched Xiao Bai\u2019s movements. He pushed off the ground violently, not sparing any of his Essence. The electricity on the Lunar Shadow Saber kept arcing around unceasingly.\u201cHa!\u201dXiao Chen shouted and headed to the earlier window. The Lunar Shadow Saber struck the ice wall violently. A small crack appeared on the rigid ice under Xiao Chen\u2019s fully powered strike.\u201cBang! Bang! Bang!\u201dHe felt incredibly anxious. Xiao Chen put aside his saber and punched at that crack forcefully. He finally created a large hole in that hard wall. Xiao Chen could not be bothered about the details and directly squeezed through it.When Duanmu Qing saw Xiao Chen trying to escape, a icy gleam flashed in her eyes. She was about to make a move when the light ball that Xiao Bai spat out arrived before her.Against this ordinary-looking light ball, Duanmu Qing paid little attention to it and casually sent out a palm strike against it.\u00a0Just an infant Spirit beast, how strong could its attack be.The instant Duanmu Qing\u2019s hand struck the light ball, a resplendent glow lit the entire ice palace. The light was even more glaring than the sun. It was so bright that no one could stand to look at it directly.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe glow faded and a horrifying energy spread out in all directions. In that instant, the ice palace that Duanmu QIng created was broken apart instantly.\u201cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u201dAll the pillars in the Liushang Pavilion shattered. In the next instant, the entire Liushang Pavilion crushed down. The entire building turned to ruins.Xiao Chen, who had just escaped, did not have enough time to evade. He was struck by the shockwave and was blasted into the sky, vomiting a mouthful of blood.A white figure escaped the rubble of Liushang Pavilion. Xiao Bai quickly ran to Xiao Chen. It had a dispirited expression; its usual liveliness was absent.After seeing its current appearance, Xiao Chen\u2019s anger dissipated significantly. He carried it in his embrace and rushed forward. The danger had not passed yet. Through his Spiritual Sense, he noticed a strong aura swelling up in the rubble of Liushang Pavilion.\u201cChi!\u201dA bright phoenix cry resounded throughout the entire White Water City. A stream of ice burst through the rubble of Liushang Pavilion and flew into the air before becoming \u00a0a huge Ice Phoenix.The Ice Phoenix stretched its wings out and a horrifyingly strong perception was spread out in all directions. Locking on Xiao Chen\u2019s figure, it took to the skies.In the instant Duanmu Qing became the Ice Phoenix and flew off, a smaller figure, carrying a zither, emerged from the rubble and vaulted towards the two people.After a long time, a fatty covered in dust stumbled out from the rubble. He swore as he stood and looked at the chaos, the completely destroyed Liushang Pavilion. He cursed in dissatisfaction, \u201cWho in the world did I offend?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How strong exactly is her opponent?\u201d\u201cIndeed, despite being thousands of meters away, the pressure of this Martial Spirit, that had existed since the Tianwu Dynasty, is this heavy.\u201d\u201cHaha! You all probably do no know. From what I heard from the people that came out of the \u00a0Liushang Pavilion, the person that forced Duanmu Qing to materialize her Martial Spirit is only a Superior Grade Martial Disciple. It seems he is an outsider.\u201cThat\u2019s not possible; Duanmu Qing is a Martial Grand Master. A Superior Grade Martial Disciple is an ant to her. Why did she materialized her Martial Spirit, and probably even used Martial Techniques?\u201d\u201cHis words are absolutely true. I came out of Liushang Pavilion. That person is actually only a Superior Grade Martial Disciple. First, he injured Jiang Muheng, then he snatched away a map of the ancient remains. Finally, he escaped from Duanmu Qing\u2019s pursuit.\u201dThe Ice Phoenix radiated a cold light as it flew to the sky, soaring above the nine heavens. Everyone within White Water City was able to see it clearly. All the cultivators were discussing it.White Water City, Jiang Residence:The final disciple of the Misty Sword Sect Leader peered at the Ice Phoenix in the sky. The expression on his face changed slightly as he muttered, \u201cWho is it? To actually be able to force Duanmu Qing to materialize her Martial Spirit?\u201dJust as he finished speaking, a sword made of light appeared below his feet and brought him to the sky. He became a shadow as he rushed off in the direction of Duanmu Qing; soon he vanished into the sky.In another room within the Jiang Residence, the Hua Clan\u2019s successor, Hua Yunfei, revealed a playful smile when he saw Duanmu Qing in the sky. After Chu Chaoyun flew off, he said, \u201cInteresting, I want to see who it is that managed to attract the attention of these two geniuses of Dongming Province.\u201dWithin the room, a few Hua Clan elders advised, \u201cSuccessor, our purpose in coming here this time is only for the remains of the ancient people. It is best that there are no complications.\u201dHua Yunfei smiled indifferently, and said in an arrogant manner, \u201cIt is rare for a mutated Martial Spirit to appear in our Hua Clan. It is destined for our Clan to rise up; no one can stop us. So, what if there are some small complications? Don\u2019t follow me.\u201dJust as he said this, he became a red river and flowed towards the sky. It seemed like a blood cloud covered the places that he went. The sky was hidden, creating an ominous feeling.Within the room of the Duanmu Clan in the Jiang Clan, a pretty girl looked at Duanmu Qing and asked worriedly, \u201cSecond Elder, is Miss Duanmu in danger? Should we be assisting her?\u201dThe incomparably graceful and luxuriously dressed Second Elder looked very calm as he spoke gently, \u201cThere is no need. if she cannot deal with this little problem, how is she going to rule our Duanmu Clan?\u201dAt the same time, the Jiang Clan Head, Jiang Mingxun, was rapidly making arrangements within the great hall of the Jiang Clan.\u201cSecond Elder, immediately set out on a journey and receive the important guest from Nanling Province. Whether our Jiang Clan can gain an opportunity will depend on this guest.\u201d\u201cThird Elder, go to Liushang Pavilion and bring that trash, Jiang Muheng, back. Throw him into isolation for a month.\u201dDue to Xiao Chen\u2019s saber strike, there were surging undercurrents in White Water City; there was a drastic change in the situation.However, regardless of how shocking the situation was or whether the situation changed drastically, Fatty Jin\u2019s currently felt persistent grief. This was a grief that belonged only to him, repeatedly dampening his spirits.\u201cYoung Master, please stop standing. You have been standing for an hour already. If you keep standing, you will fall sick,\u201d a manservant consoled the grieving Jin Dabao in the midst of the rubble of Liushang Pavilion.Although Liushang Pavilion had completely collapsed, there were no major injuries or deaths. The guests from the first and second floors had fled long before the explosion happened. The cultivators on the third and fourth floors had considerably higher cultivations and were able to jump to safety in an instant.The waiters and menservants in the pavilion were all very astute. When there were signs of trouble, they all ran out and only appeared again after things were settled.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dJust as the fatty was about to lecture him, a tiny moan sounded out. Jin Dabao quickly reacted and looked towards the origin of the sound.Pulling aside a few heavy wooden boards, Jin Dabao saw a severely injured Jiang Muheng. Xiao Chen made a deep cut on his chest. It was even possible to see the\u00a0internal organs in his chest cavity. At the moment, his wounds have not healed; blood was still flowing out slowly.The collapse of Liushang Pavilion, combined with the fact that he was already severely injured, meant Jiang Muheng was on his final breaths. He could not stop moaning and looked extremely pitiful. He no longer had the elegance he had before.The moment Fatty Jin saw this, his grief vanished and he said to Jiang Muheng, with a smile filling his face, \u201cIsn\u2019t this Young Master Jiang; why are you in such a state?\u201dJiang Muheng\u2019s face was pale, he was extremely weak, and his voice was very soft as he muttered intermittently, \u201cSave\u2026 me\u2026\u201dJin Dabao cupped his ears and leaned forward, saying in a loud voice, \u201cYoung Master Jiang, can you speak louder? Oh, I heard it. Save you? No problem.\u201dJin Dabao had a gleeful look on his face as he took out a porcelain bottle and jiggled it in front of Jiang Muheng, \u201cYoung Master Jiang, can you see this? This is a peak grade Golden Salve; refined by a Rank 7 Alchemist. All you have to do is to scatter this on your wounds. No matter what kind of wound, it will be able to heal it.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, this medicine does not have any side effects; it will not leave behind any scars. It is absolutely the best choice for an elegant young master like you,\u201d Fatty Jin spoke in a manner that was filled with temptation as he extended out the bottle to the front of Jiang Muheng.Jiang Muheng\u2019s expression revealed joy as he extended out his left hand with difficulty. He wanted to take the porcelain bottle but Fatty Jin quickly pulled his hand back.The joy on Jiang Muheng\u2019s face vanished. He looked at Jin Dabao, his gaze filled with doubt. He did not know what was going on.Jin Dabao\u2019s face made it seemed he was in a difficult position, \u201cYoung Master Jiang, the moment I met you, I felt that we have been brought together by fate. Normally, I would just give this Golden Salve away and would not even complain about it. However, as you can see, this Liushang Pavilion turned into a pile of rubble because of you.\u201d\u201cYou have cut off the path of fortune for this fatty. I am now extremely broke. Doesn\u2019t your Jiang Clan own a street for commerce west of the city? Let me have it, so I can reopen Liushang Pavilion. What do you think? All I need is a word from you, and you can have this peak grade Golden Salve. I\u2019ll even apply it for you, personally.\u201dThis fatty was truly shameless. His Liushang Pavilion was merely just a restaurant. Its profits over the period of one year in White Water City would be at most 5,000,000 taels of silver.However, the commerce street of the Jiang Clan had countless business there. Just the rent received alone was 20,000,000 taels of silver. Fatty Jin spoke as though the Jiang Clan was gaining in this transaction.Jiang Muheng\u2019s lips moved; his voice was very weak. Jin Dabao cupped his ears again and leaned forward as he said, \u201cYoung Master Jiang, please speak loudly; I can\u2019t hear you. What did you say?\u00a0Screw\u2026 your\u2026 mother\u2026?\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201d After the fatty heard this, his smile immediately vanished. He had a wooden expression as he said, \u201cThis fatty is being kind hearted and wanted to save your life. All I wanted was a street and yet you cursed me like that. This fatty is very upset.\u201d\u201cGetting snubbed despite showing good intentions really feels horrible. Let\u2019s go. With this fatty blocking the way, let's see who dares come over. Even if the Jiang Clan\u2019s people arrive, they won\u2019t be able to take you away.\u201dJust as the fatty got up and took a step, his pant leg was snagged by a hand. Jin Dabao had long anticipated Jiang Muheng would not give up so simply.He hurriedly put on a smile and turned around, \u201cYoung master Jiang, did you change your mind? Your voice is too soft. I\u2019m listening but don\u2019t you curse at me again. Or else, this fatty will get angry.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 What\u2019s your name\u2026? Come quickly and\u00a0crouch down over\u00a0here\u00a0so I can use you as a table. Young Master Jiang has agreed already.\u201dIn an instant, brush and paper appeared in the fatty\u2019s hands. A manservant crouched on the floor as he sucked on the brush as though he was very learned. Then, he dipped the brush in ink and started to scribble wildly.[TL note: Scribble wildly, \u72c2\u8349: This is an excessively free cursive style in Chinese calligraphy.}After he drew up the contract, he placed it under Jiang Muheng\u2019s hand and smiled, \u201cYoung Master Jiang, please imprint your handprint and signed it. What nice handwriting\u2026 even though Young Master Jiang is so injured, your penmanship is still excellent. You are the perfect model of someone from a noble clan.\u201dWhen Jiang Muheng signed the contract, the fatty immediately rolled it up and took out the peak grade Golden Salve. He slowly scattered it on Jiang Muheng\u2019s wounds.The pained expression on Jiang Muheng\u2019s face slowly faded. As he was seriously hurt, the moment he relaxed, he fainted.\u201cHahaha! How great! I lost a gold mine only to gain a treasure mountain!\u201d Fatty Jin laughed maniacally as he held\u00a0the contract.The manservant at the side saw that Fatty Jin had truly applied the peak grade Golden Salve on Jiang Muheng. He did not understand and asked, \u201cYoung Master, did you really apply the peak grade Golden Salve made by a Rank Seven Alchemist?\u201d\u201cYes, is there a problem?\u201dThat manservant said with a tone of doubt, \u201cThis is not your usual style. I thought Young Master would just simply use a Rank 3 medicine, skimping on the materials.\u201dFatty Jin put aside the contract and he took out his gold folding fan, hitting the manservant\u2019s head ruthlessly. He laughed loudly, \u201cWhat do you know? How many foolish and rash people, like Jiang Muheng, do you think there are in the Great Qin Nation? Don\u2019t the Jiang Clan still have three more streets?\u201d\u201cThis fatty will treat him now, and the next time I can go to him and cheat him out of another street. This small amount of money is nothing.\u201dThe manservant spoke in awe, \u201cYoung Master is truly wise! This is throwing a line to catch a big fish, right? Why did I not think of that?\u201d[TL note: Throwing a line to catch a big fish. This means adopting a long term plan to secure something big.]\u201cDon\u2019t ask any more of these kinds of stupid business questions,\u201d the fatty commanded a pretentious manner.After he said this, he opened his gold folding fan and fanned himself vigorously. He inclined his head upward by 45 degrees and looked at the clouds floating above. He sighed in sorrow, \u201cSometimes, having such a high intelligence is such a bane! Who in the world can understand me\u2026 life is truly as lonely as snow!\u201d\u201cWa!\u201d Just as Fatty Jin finished his words, all the waiters and manservant at the rubble of Liushang Pavilion could not help but vomit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He felt heartbroken as he looked at the incredibly weak Xiao Bai, who had fainted in his embrace.The attack Xiao Bai executed was the most powerful attack in the Mysterious Nine Heavenly Revolution Transformation. It compressed the essence of the body nine times before releasing it out in an explosive manner. It caused a lot of damage to the body.Once, when Xiao Chen wax training in Savage Forest, he ran into a Rank 4 Spirit Beast. At a very critical moment, Xiao Bai used this move.It was then Xiao Chen realized the might of this technique, as well as the harm it does to the body. Thus, he scolded Xiao Bai severely, telling it to never use it. Who knew\u2026 it would actually use it today?Raising his head, he saw Duanmu Qing, who turned into the Ice Phoenix, chasing tightly after him. From another two directions, a figure riding a sword and a blood cloud caught his attention.Remembering the fatty\u2019s introduction, Xiao Chen could guess the identity of these two people. He smiled faintly and said to himself, \u201cThe three geniuses of Dongming Province are chasing after me; they think too highly of me.\u201dXiao Chen executed the Azure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art to its extreme and leaped around in a zigzag fashion. From afar, it looked like the shadow of an azure dragon, soaring into the sky.As long as he entered Savage Forest, Xiao Chen had the confidence to throw off his pursuers. He had trained within Savage Forest for more than a month and was extremely familiar with it.\u201cBoom!\u201dJust as Xiao Chen was about the enter the outer periphery of Savage Forest, Duanmu Qing suddenly transformed into a stream of flowing ice and landed in front of Xiao Chen.The flowing ice moved as though it was water, changing its shape continuously. After a short period of time, it took human form. Duanmu Qing\u2019s beauty appeared in front of Xiao Chen.Her white hair fluttered all over the place and there was a fire lit in her eyes; she looked like a transcendental goddess. She spoke slowly in a frigid voice, \u201cHand over the map and I will not make things difficult for you.\u201dXiao Chen did not reply and quickly used Lightning Evasion to run. If he had wanted to give it to her, he would have already done so at Liushang Pavilion.Now that he was at the edge of Savage Forest, he had to make an attempt. Although Xiao Chen did not know what map this was, seeing how anxious she appeared, it was clear that it was not some ordinary map.\u201cHau! Hua!\u201dThe blood river in the sky descended to the ground. Hua Yunfei appeared behind Duanmu Qing.\u201cChi!\u201dChu Chaoyun, who was riding on the sword, landed rapidly and firmly on the ground. The sword underneath his feet morphed into a beam of light and flew into his forehead.The three of them were in no rush to chase after Xiao Chen. Hua Yunfei looked at the two of them, revealing a trace of a demonic smile as he said, \u201cMy friends, since Miss Duanmu still has not caught this fellow yet, let\u2019s do this.\u201cThe three of us will work together to chase after him. Who ever who obtains the map will have to share it with the others. What do you think?\u201dThere were no changes in Chu Chaoyun\u2019s expression; his current emotions could not be seen through. He said, \u201cI agree. Our three clans have turned up without invitation. Jiang Mingxun has been resisting the pressure we place on him, refusing to lead the way. He must be waiting for help.\u201d\u201cI hear that the Ji Clan from Nanling Province is arriving soon. When they arrive, there will be another strong opponent. If we can snatch the map and rush ahead of the Jiang Clan, our three clans can disregard the Jiang Clan and work together to search.\u201dDuanmu Qing\u2019s white hair slowly turned black again; the fiery look in her eyes seemed to have calmed down and became more welcoming. She pursed her red lips and responded, \u201cSure.\u201dAfter the three of them spoke, they immediately entered Savage Forest. Each of them using their own methods to chase in the direction Xiao Chen fled.After the three of them left, Su Xiaoxiao appeared,\u00a0carrying her zither. She said softly, \u201cIt really is the Azure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art. I did not see incorrectly the last time. The head of the four Holy Beast, the Azure Dragon, has reappeared in this world.\u201dAfter she said this, she did not enter Savage Forest. She looked to be deep in thought. After a long time, she quickly rushed towards White Water City.Not long after Su Xiaoxiao left, the Jiang Clan\u2019s first elder, Jiang Yunze, rushed over, leading a group of cultivators. This group of cultivators were all Martial Masters; there were 200 of them.Jiang Yunze looked at Savage Forest in front of him and said, \u201cSplit yourselves into 20 groups, each group consisting of ten people. After you discover the target, take action immediately. Ten Martial Masters going against a single Inferior Grade Martial Disciple... there should be no danger of anything going wrong.\u201dAfter he said this, he took out a few portraits and handed them out, \u201cSavage Forest is very large. It is possible that we might not find him by simply relying on our numbers. If you meet any cultivators that are training in the forest, hand this portrait to them and ask for their assistance in capturing him.\u201dIn the outer perimeters of Savage Forest, Xiao Chen was rapidly dashing through the woods. His Spiritual Sense was extended out. The situation within 800 meters of himself was reflected in his mind.The entire Savage Forest extended out for thousands of kilometers. Just the outer perimeter itself was more than a thousand hectares. Aside from Spirit Beasts, there were many hunters and cultivators who came to train. By hiding in Savage Forest, his pursuers would be searching for a needle in a haystack.\u201cHu Chi!\u201dA group of gray wolves appeared in Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense. The gray wolves were Rank 3 Spirit Beasts that moved in a group. There would be at least 20 of them every time they appeared. Xiao Chen knew they were not easy to deal with and he prepared to go around them.Xiao Chen withdrew his Spiritual Sense and used it to sweep through the\u00a0area to\u00a0either side. Just at that moment, there was the sound of footsteps. Xiao Chen trembled in his heart; he did not know who they were. He quickly hid in a bush to the side.\u201cThis fellow really knows how to hide. After searching for so long, there is still no trace of him.\u201d\u201cI wonder how this fellow offended the Jiang Clan\u2026 to think that\u00a0he\u00a0was actually able to cause the Jiang Clan to set a bounty of 1000 gold taels on him, announcing it to the entire city.\u201d\u201cI heard this fellow had stolen a treasure map from the Jiang Clan. It is the map of the ancient remains according to recent rumors. If we get it, do you think we can go try our luck?\u201d\u201cHaha! Just based on your cultivation as a Medial Grade Martial Master? I would advise you not to dream too big. That map is just a copy, the original is still in the hands of the Jiang Clan. The three great powers of Dongming Province are here already. I\u2019m afraid, even before you come close, you would be killed. We are better off not playing any tricks and behaving, handing the map over to the Jiang Clan and earning some hush money.\u201d\u201cYou're right. This treasure is very enticing. Without our lives, we would not be able to enjoy it. Let\u2019s keep searching; I'm very sure I saw that fellow running in this direction.\u201dXiao Chen, who had hidden in the bush, was startled.\u00a0To think the Jiang Clan\u2019s influence is so strong. They are able to pull all the cultivators in Savage Forest over to their side. Seems like I\u2019m in trouble; I have to quickly rush over to that place.One of the cultivators held a steel knife in his hand and walked over to the bush where Xiao Chen hid. He used the steel knife to clear the thorny undergrowth that was in his path unceasingly.I\u2019m about to be discovered; I can\u2019t go on like this,\u00a0seeing that person get nearer, Xiao Chen thought in his heart,\u00a0I have to take the initiative and make my move.\u201cHua!\u201dXiao Chen launched out of the bush and, taking advantage of the moment the person was startled, he used his saber to slice him into two halves. After that, he quickly rushed towards the remaining five cultivators.\u201cHe killed Lao Jiu! Quickly! Kill him!\u201d When the crowd saw that Lao Jiu was cut into two halves with a single move, they were shocked. Lao Jiu was a Medial Grade Martial Master... to think that he could be killed in one move by this person.\u201cDrawing the Saber!\u201dXiao Chen executed the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique, the electrical light of the Lunar Shadow Saber shined in all directions. The energy of the Rank 6 Demonic Core was displayed fully. The saber light flashed in the sky and a cultivator in the front was chopped into two halves as well.\u201cArclight Chop!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d When a cultivator to the side saw that another of his companions was killed by Xiao Chen, his eyes became bloodshot and he ignored his own well being. He Brandished his sword with the intent to kill Xiao Chen, facing the Arclight Chop head on.\u201cPu Chi!\u201dOnce the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique was initiated, the user could not retreat, or else his aura would drop to a very low point. He would not be able to raise his aura back and use the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique for a short period of time.Xiao Chen did not evade his strike. The sword slashed across Xiao Chen\u2019s chest leaving a wound, dripping with blood. However, before this person could feel pleased about it, he was cut into two halves by the Arclight Chop.\u201cRushing Heaven Chop!\u201dXiao Chen held the Lunar Shadow Saber and soared into the air. He pierced through the chest of a person in front of him. The huge force instantly exploded that person\u2019s body into tiny pieces.\u201cRushing Thunder Chop!\u201dThunder crackled in the sky; Xiao Chen used the might of the heavenly lightning and came crashing downward. One of the people below used his saber to block. The blade of the saber snapped with a loud bang; the Lunar Shadow Saber easily sliced his body in two halves, from head to legs.\u201cRushing Thunder Second Chain Chop!\u201dXiao Chen spun around and gathered all the energy of the previous four strikes, releasing it explosively in the Rushing Thunder Second Chain Chop. The person who was getting ready to sneak attack Xiao Chen from behind was shattered to powder by the tremendous force behind the saber.Seeing the six corpses on the ground, Xiao Chen did not feel any unease in his heart. Since these people wanted to kill him to get the map, they should be prepared to get killed, themselves.He took out a Qi Returning Pill and placed it in his mouth. Xiao Chen looked at the scar on his chest and frowned slightly. If Tang Feng did not destroy his Battle Armor when he shot him, this saber would never be able to injure him.After leaving Mohe City, Xiao Chen discovered the Profound Rank Battle Armor, which Xiao Xiong gave him, had lost its spirituality, becoming an ordinary soft armor. In order to not hamper his movements, Xiao Chen threw away the Battle Armor.With Xiao Chen\u2019s strength, he could have taken his time and killed this group of people without wasting much of his Essence.Xiao Chen was worried that it would drag on for too long and attract more trouble. Thus, he used his more Essence demanding Rushing Thunder Saber Technique, so he could deal with the problem as fast as possible.He took out a Blood Replenishing Pill, crushed it and scattered it on his wounds. Then, Xiao Chen opened the bags of the six cultivators.These were cultivators that had trained in Savage Forest for a long time. There was a large amount of Spirit Cores and herbs. Xiao Chen counted them; there was a total of four Rank 3 Spirit Cores and five Rank 4 herbs. The others were just some items of low value. Xiao Chen casually threw them away.These are worth some money.\u00a0Xiao Chen revealed a smile on his face as he put the Rank 3 Spirit Cores and Rank 4 herbs into the Universe Ring.On the following journey, Xiao Chen decided that even if his Essence was exhausted rapidly, he would keep his Spiritual Sense extended out. As long as he detected someone, he would avoid them. Does not matter whether they have any malicious intent or not; he would go around them.When it was near dusk, Xiao Chen arrived at a desolate place in the outer periphery of Savage Forest. Upon arriving there, Xiao Chen\u2019s tense mood finally relaxed. He also withdrew his Spiritual Sense.He took large steps as he walked into the forest before him. As his figure moved into the forest, it had a very odd pace to it. After an extended time, Xiao Chen\u2019s figure suddenly and mysteriously disappeared into the forest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Immortal and Martial Dual CultivationCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 97:\u00a0Bitter TrainingWithin the forest, Xiao Chen seemed to have disappeared into thin air. When Xiao Chen reappeared, the scene in front of his eyes had a devastating change.There was a gushing waterfall in the distance, flowing down from a mountain stream into a long river below. At the river bank, there was a large and spacious area. Just by standing on the bank, one could a smell the clean and refreshing air.This river was known as Zhuang River. There were many rivers in Savage Forest; this river was just one of the unremarkable many. Xiao Chen was at was the source of the river.This place would not be easily noticed by those who did not know of it. Practically no one paid any attention to this place but Xiao Chen\u2019s Spiritual Sense could detect something unusual in this area.In the cave behind the waterfall, there was a large stone. The Spiritual Energy was extremely dense there. If one cultivated on top of it, they would be able to be faster by about 50 percent compared to cultivating outside.After Xiao Chen accidentally discovered it, he immediately laid down an illusion formation in order to misdirect others. This area was originally very desolate; when Xiao Chen was laying the formation, he went about it in an unhurried manner, not worrying at all.This illusion formation took Xiao Chen a total of ten days to complete. As long as no Martial King came here, no one would be able to discover this place. Even if they came to the surrounding area by accident, they would unconsciously go around it.Now that Xiao Chen was here, he was completely safe. He casually found a flat rock and sat cross legged. He slowly circulated the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation and entered into a state of cultivation.The sun rose and scattered its light on the land; the night passed, uninterrupted. Xiao Chen opened his eyes and took a deep breath. He jumped down from the rock and washed his face at the riverside.In the morning, the waterfall had stopped gushing and the surface of the river was as calm as a mirror. Xiao Chen raised his leg and stepped on the surface of the river; his body miraculously stopped on the surface of the water.Xiao Chen\u2019s heart was as calm as the water as he circulated the mental cultivation methods of the Azure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art. He closed his eyes and slowly walked on the river\u2019s surface. Every step he took sent ripples through the water.In the ancient legends, the dragon was the overlord of the sky and seas. It could submerge itself in the abyss, overturn the seas and rivers, and summon the wind and rain; there was nothing it could not do. When it flew up into the nine heavens, it could ride on the clouds, summon the wind and lightning in an instant, and fly thousands of kilometers in a flash.The Azure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art was such a movement technique. When practiced to great perfection, the legend of riding on clouds or overturning the seas and rivers could be easily accomplished.In the past few days, Xiao Chen had been practicing the Azure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art in the middle of Zhuang River. He initially did not make any progress; however, now he was in the small success stage and was able to walk on the water\u2019s surface slowly.Xiao Chen walked slowly on the water, comprehending the profoundness of the Azure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art. When the sun rose to its peak, the sound of water falling could be heard.The energetic waterfall began to gush once again. The calm river surface became turbulent. Xiao Chen opened his eyes and a grave look appeared in\u00a0his gaze.From this moment forward, at this time every day, the training truly started. If Xiao Chen was careless, he would instantly drop into the water, getting soaked in the process.The river water was flowing rapidly. Xiao Chen stood on the surface. Every step he took against the flow, he exhausted a large amount of Essence. However, his body still swayed left and right on the water.\u201cPu Tong!\u201dWhen Xiao Chen walked about a hundred steps, he could no longer maintain it and fell into the river. The turbulent water flushed Xiao Chen\u2019s body down the river rapidly.The peaceful Zhuang River now revealed its malevolent side. The turbulent water carried a huge force; it was pushing on Xiao Chen\u2019s body, making it exceptionally difficult for him to maintain balance as he flowed downstream rapidly.This was not the first time this had happened to him. Xiao Chen did not panic and was very calm. Holding his breath, his body slowly sank to the bottom of the river.The Essence in his body circulated as he waited to take action after he accumulated some strength. He pushed off the riverbed with his feet and his body shot up like an arrow, leaping out of the water.When he fell toward the water again, he somersaulted in the air and landed firmly on the river\u2019s\u00a0bank.Looking at the rushing river, Xiao Chen felt gratitude. If a regular cultivator was not in a good state of mind, it would be possible for them to die in the turbulent water.Xiao Chen was feeling very uncomfortable as his whole body was dripping wet. Xiao Chen dried his face and removed his clothing. Then, he took out a set of dry clothes from the Universe Ring and changed into them.At this moment, it was no longer suitable to practice the movement technique. Xiao Chen did not waste any time after that. After eating some dried rations, he took out a wooden pole and stood it upright on the ground.He held the Lunar Shadow Saber and stood under the blazing sun, practicing the first move of the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique. In his opinion, he had to be able to chop at the pole at least twenty times before the wooden pole fell over for it to be considered to be in the great perfection stage.He was currently able to do it four times; that was barely considered to be in the small success stage. There was still a long way to go before hitting the large success stage.\u201cShua! Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua!\u201dAfter practicing for two hours, Xiao Chen was able to make five consecutive cuts. The light wooden pole wobbled for a moment but it did not fall over.\u201cFinally, there is some progress! I can make five consecutive chops!\u201d Xiao Chen said joyfully as he wiped the sweat from his forehead and the handle of his saber.After leaving Mohe City, Xiao Chen realized that there were too many geniuses in this world. He pretty much amounted to nothing.Just in Dongming Province alone, before reaching the age of 16 or 17, the successors of the three great powers had cultivated to Martial Grand Master already.This was a realm that most regular cultivators would not reach in their lifetime. However, they were able to do it easily before the age of 16 or 17. It can only be said, when constantly comparing oneself to others, it will only make one angry.When the scope was widened to include the entire world, there were countless scary geniuses. Xiao Chen\u2019s current achievements were simple, not even worth mentioning. He was like a drop in the ocean, totally unremarkable.Since he had arrived in this world where strength reigned, he was not resigned to being ruled over by others, to become a stepping stone for others, and sink into the dregs of history.Without a strong talent, he had to put in many times the effort, just like the Thunder Emperor from a thousand year ago. He was born in a poor family, but he relied on only himself to trample over all the geniuses of the noble families.He had obtained the inheritance of the Thunder Emperor; even if he could not be bothered with his own pride, he had to care about the legendary reputation of the Thunder Emperor. Since he did not have this kind of demonic talent, he had to put in hundreds or thousands times more the effort.He erected a wooden pole once again and focused himself. He continued tirelessly practicing Drawing the Saber. The number of wooden poles which laid on the ground continued to increase.After an hour, Xiao Chen sheathed his saber and rested for awhile. He then walked slowly to the river\u2019s bank and gazed at the gushing waterfall in the distance; it had already weakened significantly.\u201cKill!\u201dHe shouted lightly and jumped violently onto the surface of the turbulent water, running at a rapid speed on its surface. Ripples surged through the surroundings; the water splashed two meters high beside him.Xiao Chen kept running, not stopping to rest even for a moment. When he reached underneath the waterfall, he shouted loudly and leaped up high into the air.A spear made of Qi appeared in front of him. With a \u2018shua\u2019 sound, it sliced apart the cascading water. Xiao Chen landed on a rock behind the waterfall. This was the cave that was behind the rush of water.It was only about two meters deep and the air was very humid. The water that flowed down over the entrance of the cave was like a curtain of water. It was very similar to the Water Curtain Cave in his previous life.[TL notes: \u6c34\u5e18\u6d1e, Water Curtain Cave, is a reference to a Chinese legend of a monkey born from a rock and eventually turning into a deity. Many of you might have read about this before, it's the legend of Sun Wukong in Journey to the West. The Water Curtain Cave is where this monkey lived in his early days.]In the cavern was a very smooth and flat rock. Xiao Chen revealed a faint smile and slowly sat upon it. He immediately entered into a state of cultivation; the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation circulated unceasingly in his body.The dense Spiritual Energy in the surroundings poured into Xiao Chen\u2019s body continuously. The Spiritual Energy was so dense that it was like a fog; it was almost as though it would liquefy.Xiao Chen only circulated it with a cycle and the meridians in the body were already saturated with Spiritual Energy. That was a sense of extreme excitement rising from the area where his Martial Spirit was.Xiao Chen knew this was a sign of advancing in cultivation realm. As long as he was willing, he could immediately recover his cultivation as an Inferior Grade Martial Master.However, Xiao Chen did not do that. Back then, after using the Ninth Heaven\u2019s Thunder Formation, his cultivation fell to Superior Grade Martial Disciple. He then thought about it carefully and felt that this was not a bad thing. Instead, it was an opportunity for him to establish a firmer foundation.He only spent a few months to progress from Spirit Refinement to Inferior Grade Martial Master. To an ordinary cultivator, this was something inconceivable. Regardless of the situation, he never did establish a proper foundation.It was important for the foundation of a tall building to be done properly. Only by establishing a proper foundation, would the tall building not collapse.The path of Martial Cultivation had the same principles. If Spirit Refinement was to be compared to digging out a foundation, then Martial Disciple was the equivalent to laying the foundation.Xiao Chen had spent considerably more time than others in the Spirit Refinement Realm; he spent a total of 15 years. The foundation that he dug was much deeper than others. Now, all he had to do was to lay his foundation once again and make a foundation that was unbreakable.With just a thought, Xiao Chen infused the large amount of Spiritual Energy he absorbed into his flesh and bones, slowly tempering his body.After the Essence circulated in his body for nine cycles, Xiao Chen\u2019s eyes shot open. There was a sticky black substance covering his body. Xiao Chen leaped out of the entrance of the cave into the gushing waterfall, washing away the impurities that were eliminated from his body thoroughly.He immediately felt undoubtedly refreshed; he was carefree and relaxed. He could not help but shout loudly. His aura exploded out to the extreme. The water droplets that clung to his body instantly evaporated.\u201cBoom!\u201dXiao Chen landed heavily on the surface of the water. A huge force extended out from the bottom of his feet. In the next moment, a three-meter high splash soared around him.Pushing off with his feet lightly, Xiao Chen returned to the river bank. The sun was setting on the boundless horizon; night had arrived. One day went by so quickly.A small white figure rushed over from the outside of the illusion formation. When Xiao Chen saw it, he revealed a smile. No matter how boring or lonely this cultivation session was, he would still have Xiao Bai to accompany him.After recovering for a night, Xiao Bai regained its high spirited nature. It had escaped from the Spirit Blood Jade long ago.Xiao Chen was not too worried about its safety. Xiao Bai\u2019s speed was incredibly fast after cultivating the Mysterious Nine Heavenly Revolution Transformation. Even Xiao Chen would be left in the dust.When it ran over to Xiao Chen, there was a herb in its mouth. It placed it in Xiao Chen\u2019s hand as though it was paying tribute. Xiao Chen did not find this strange; Xiao Bai was quite sensitive to such natural treasures with a Spiritual Nature. Every time it went out, it would normally return with some harvest.Xiao Chen carefully inspected the herb in his hand. His eyes lit up as he said in joy, \u201cRank 5 Spirit Herb \u2014 Vanilla Rue! This is a stalk of superior grade 30 year old herb. It is worth thousands of gold taels.\u201dHearing Xiao Chen\u2019s joyful words, Xiao Bai exposed a very human-like smile. Obviously, it was very pleased.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The days in the mountain valley passed very quickly. In the blink of an eye, Xiao Chen had cultivated for a week in front of this waterfall.In the meantime, Xiao Chen unceasingly practiced the Azure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art. When the river became turbulent, he would go to the riverbank and practice the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique. At dusk, he would cultivate the Purple Thunder Divine Incantation, continuously strengthening his foundation and tempering his body.\u201cHua!\u201dOn this day, Xiao Chen leaped out from the cave behind the waterfall. He landed heavily on the water\u2019s surface, creating a huge splash; water droplets flew everywhere. The waves soared to the sky.He pushed lightly off and Xiao Chen returned to the riverbank. After a week of cultivating, the Essence in his body turned purer and denser. It was comparable to that of a Superior Grade Martial Master.After resting for a short while, Xiao Chen looked at the exit of the illusion formation.\u00a0Normally, Xiao Bai would have returned by now. Why is it not back yet?Xiao Bao was naturally loved by the forest; it had a special relationship with the woods. Ever since they came to Savage Forest, Xiao Chen was not able to control it; it would always run out on its own.Xiao Bai, who cultivated the Mysterious Nine Heavenly Revolution Transformation, was unrivaled in the periphery of Savage Forest. However, Xiao Chen still worried about it. If it ran into the inner reaches of Savage Forest, it would be problematic.Just as Xiao Chen hesitated on whether to go out and search for Xiao Bai, a white figure appeared in his vision. Before Xiao Chen could smile, he discovered there was something wrong with Xiao Bai.It was slower than usual. When it got near, he discovered there was a lot of bleeding wounds on its snow white pelt. The red blood against its snow white fur was very prominent.Xiao Bai peaked at Xiao Chen\u2019s gaze, as though it was afraid and did not dare to come near, as if it was a kid who had done something wrong. Xiao Chen had a sullen expression as he picked Xiao Bai up, carrying it.After carefully inspecting its wounds, he sighed in relief. These were only superficial wounds. Next, he took out a Blood Replenishing Pill and crushed it before slowly applying it onto Xiao Bai\u2019s wounds. He then went to the riverside and washed the blood from Xiao Bai\u2019s body.\u201cSee, if you dare to keep running outside what will happen? Now, you know how dangerous it is.\u201d Xiao Chen lectured Xiao Bai as he placed it on a patch of soft grass.The Blood Replenishing Pill\u2019s effect was quite good. After it completed permeated the wounds, Xiao Bai immediately began to heal and slowly form scabs. When it saw Xiao Chen lecturing it, it got up in a somewhat indignant manner and gesticulated while making \u2018ziya ziya\u2019 sounds.Although Xiao Bai was unable to speak human language, Xiao Chen was able to understand roughly what it was saying because it had signed a blood contract with him. It saw a stalk of Spirit Herb in the outer periphery and wanted to pick it, as it did normally.Who knew there was a four legged snake resting nearby It was extremely fast. Before\u00a0Xiao\u00a0Bai managed to get near, it was injured by the claws of the four legged snake. Xiao Bai was startled and quickly rushed back.Xiao Chen thought about it; from Xiao Bai\u2019s description, this four legged snake should be the Rank 4 Spirit Beast \u2014 Black Legged Snake. However, why would there be a Rank 4 Spirit Beast in the outer periphery of Savage Forest?A Rank 4 Spirit Beast was the equivalent to a human Martial Grand Master. Rank 3 Spirit Beasts were rarely seen in the outer periphery of Savage Forest. Yet, for a Rank 4 Spirit beast to appear to be guarding a stalk of natural treasure, it showed that the natural treasure was of a very high rank.Xiao Chen looked at Xiao Bai and asked it seriously, \u201cAre you sure you were in the outer periphery of Savage Forest?\u201dXiao Bai nodded gravely.Xiao Chen thoughts moved rapidly; this stalk of natural treasure was obviously not ordinary. It was quite possibly like the Red Nascent Fruit in the outskirts of Seven Horn Mountain. That place could be the location with the densest Spiritual Energy in the entire outer periphery of Savage Forest.If it were under normal circumstances, Xiao Chen would have made up his mind to get it. A Rank 4 Spirit beast was only as strong as a Martial Grand Master. However, a Spirit Beast was just a beast; its thoughts were not as flexible as a human\u2019s, nor could it use Martial techniques or Spirit Weapons.If he paid a certain price, Xiao Chen had the confidence to deal with this Black Legged Snake. However, the problem was he did not know if the people of the Jiang Clan have returned yet. If they were still around, and the Jiang Clan caught wind of his movements, it would be very difficult to escape.\u201cSeeking fortune amidst danger, the path of cultivation has always been filled with boundless danger. The key is to take a gamble,\u201d Xiao Chen made his decision and stopped hesitating. After Xiao Bai recovered to a certain extent, he said, \u201cXiao Bai, lead the way; I\u2019ll take revenge on your behalf.\u201dXiao Bai cried happily and led Xiao Chen out of the illusion formation. The scene in front of Xiao Chen suddenly changed. The huge tree and the silent forest appeared before Xiao Chen\u2019s vision.Xiao Bai\u2019s speed was especially fast; if Xiao Chen did not execute the Azure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art, he would not be able to catch up. One man and one beast traveling very fast. Xiao Chen ignored all the Spirit Beasts that they encountered and left them behind.After arriving at a small ravine, Xiao Bai froze. Xiao Chen extended his Spirit Sense into the ravine. At the end of the ravine, in an extremely well-hidden crevice, Xiao Chen saw a seven colored petal.\u201cSeven Leaf Flower!\u201dXiao Chen was incomparably astonished... to think there would be a Seven Leaf Flower growing here; it was too shocking! The Seven Leaf Flower was a true natural treasure.\u00a0It had a total of seven different colored flower petals at its most mature state.\u00a0Every ten years, a new petal would grow.Once the seven petals grew and twenty years thereafter, there would be a rainbow colored Seven leaf Fruit. Xiao Chen extended his Spiritual Sense to the Seven Leaf Flower and observed it carefully. He discovered, with disappointment, the fruit in the middle of the flower petals had been picked by someone.They only left behind the different colored petals. Even though the Seven Color Fruit had been picked, the remaining flower petals were still useful to cultivators.Each petal could temper the cultivator\u2019s body once. After the tempering of the Seven Petal Flower, the body of the cultivator would undergo a qualitative change.Xiao Chen withdrew his Spiritual Sense and asked Xiao Bai, \u201cWhen you came earlier, was the fruit still there?\u201dXiao Bai continuously made \u2018ziya ziya\u2019 sounds. After Xiao Chen listened to it, he could not help but ask curiously, \u201cWhen Xiao Bai came earlier, it was still here? Why is it gone now?\u201dWhen he scanned the entire ravine earlier, he did not see the Black Legged Snake. Xiao Chen was sure that the Seven Leaf Fruit had been snatched by it. With a thought from Xiao Chen, he released his Spiritual Sense again. He carefully observed and searched every corner of the ravine.Finally, on a slope in the ravine, Xiao Chen discovered a trace of the Black Legged Snake. It was hiding behind a huge stone. The sparkling and translucent Seven Leaf Fruit was laying in front of the Black Legged Snake.The Black Legged Snake\u2019s eyes were closed. There was a golden Spiritual Energy wafting from the Seven Leaf Fruit. The body of the Black Legged Snake was two meters long; below the body of the snake were its four legs. Its body was as thick as a bowl, and it was covered in blackish gold scales.It opened its mouth wide and sucked in all the golden Spiritual Energy. It wore an extremely cheerful expression.Xiao Chen was astonished in his heart, \u201cThis Black Legged Snake is not stupid; it knows that the Seven Leaf Fruit contains a shocking amount of Spiritual Energy that it cannot swallow in one bite.Xiao Chen executed the Gravity Spell, landing lightly on the side of the ravine where the Seven Leaf Flower was. A faint fragrance emitted from the Seven Leaf Flower. Xiao Chen revealed a faint smile. He grabbed the roots and pulled gently, carefully picking it and placing it into the Universe Ring.\u201cHu!\u201dHe landed lightly on the ground and extended out his Spiritual Sense once again. The Black Legged Snake was drunk on the Spiritual Energy of the Seven Leaf Fruit. It did not notice the situation at all.The corners of Xiao Chen\u2019s mouth curled in a cold smile. He used his Spiritual Sense to lock onto the side of the Black Legged Snake, then he shouted lightly.\u201cLightning Evasion!\u201dThere was a crack of thunder in the ravine; lightning streaked across the air. Xiao Chen suddenly appeared beside the Black Legged Snake. His Lunar Shadow Saber gave off a resplendent electrical light.The Drawing the Saber that he practiced many times was executed without hesitation. \u201cKeng!\u201d The Lunar Shadow Saber chopped violently on the spine of the Black Legged Snake. This location happened to be the weakest point of the snake.A 66 cm long gash appeared on the blackish gold scales. The black blood of the Black Legged Snake spurted out like a fountain.He actually did not manage to chop it in half. Xiao Chen was very surprised. He thought that he could take advantage of it was not paying attention and deal with it in one blow. He never expected that he would be able to only wound it.Under the intense pain, the Black Legged Snake\u2019s mouth gaped wide, to a point where it seemed exaggerated. It gave off a painful hoarse sound as its huge tail thrashed towards Xiao Chen.The tail of the Black Legged Snake hit as hard as a hammer; it twisted itself to an inconceivable angle and attacked from above. The twinkling black liquid from the tip of its tail was actually venom.Xiao Chen was overwhelmed with shock and he quickly retreated backward. The snake tail struck the spot where Xiao Chen was like a hammer. The huge force created a half a meter wide pit.\u201cBang!\u201dAfter the snake tail landed, it swept across horizontally, rapidly heading toward Xiao Chen. Xiao Chen was startled; he never expected that the snake tail could move with such a fast speed.His body stopped in midair and rose higher by 3.3 meters, evading the huge tail flying at him. Before Xiao Chen could relax, he saw the tail circling around in the air. The length actually tripled and headed towards Xiao Chen.\u201cBoom!\u201dNot only did its length triple, its speed was also increased significantly. Xiao Chen had never seen such a strange thing in his life. He was caught off guard was struck by the tail.The huge force behind the snake tail caused Xiao Chen to be flung to the ground. Xiao Chen\u2019s body had undergone many rounds of tempering and was showing the early signs of an iron body.After Xiao Chen was struck by the tail, he felt his insides churn a little. He did not suffer from too much damage. If an ordinary Martial Master was struck by this, he would have died from his internal organs rupturing.Xiao Chen landed on the slope and rolled down at a great speed. That Black Legged Snake dashed to him quickly with its four feet. Its two-meter long body was headed toward Xiao Chen at a rapid speed.Xiao Chen shouted lightly and stopped himself from rolling. He pushed off with his right foot, leaping into the air before landing firmly on the ground.When the Black Legged Snake saw that Xiao Chen immediately landed in a clear area within the valley, it realized that Xiao Chen was not slower than itself.It opened its mouth and spat a black liquid at its opponent.Xiao Chen flicked his finger and a purple flame condensed at his its tip. After circulating once, it was fired at the venomous fluid. \u201cPu Ci!\u201d The venomous fluid was instantly struck by the flame.After giving off \u2018chi chi\u2019 sounds, the venomous fluid dissipated into thick black smoke and blossomed in all directions. The speed of the black smoke\u2019s spread was extremely fast. In a blink of the eye, it covered half the space in the ravine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He took out a black flannel handkerchief and used it to cover his mouth and nose. This flannel was made from the skin of Spirit Beasts; it was able to filter out most gases.The black flannel was not some precious treasure; most cultivators who enter Savage Forest would normally carry one. Xiao Chen preferred to be prepared, just in case. The first time he entered Savage Forest, he had one already prepared.The thick smoke pervaded the air; his surroundings were covered in fog. His vision was severely impaired. Xiao Chen extended out his Spiritual Sense, immediately catching wind of the Black Legged Snake\u2019s position.Seeing that Xiao Chen was inside the poisonous cloud, the Black Legged Snake thought his vision was limited. It quickly ran over to Xiao Chen and ruthlessly used its huge tail to smash forward.Xiao Chen retreated hastily. The huge tail quickly extended, chasing after Xiao Chen.Xiao Chen used his Spiritual Sense to lock onto the huge tail. He discovered, after the tail extended, the originally dense scales had thinned out.Chance!\u00a0Xiao Chen thought to himself.\u00a0This Black Legged Snake must think that he was not able to see it in this thick smoke. That must be why it was so daring and attacked him without restrain.\u201cKill!\u201dXiao Chen shouted loudly and quickly executed the Azure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art. He leaped off the ground and reached a height of 10 meters instantly. The shadow of a dragon appeared behind him and he executed the simplified version of the Descending Divine Dragon Chop.The Black Legged Snake felt a dangerous aura and it quickly withdrew its tail. However, the speed of the Descending Divine Dragon Chop was incredibly swift.Xiao Chen managed to ruthlessly chop at a spot where the scales were quite sparse as it only managed to withdraw its tail halfway. The tail of the Black Legged Snake was instantly chopped in half.\u201cPu Ci!\u201dAt where the tail was chopped off, blood spurted out like a geyser.\u00a0The blood of this fellow is probably venomous as well.\u00a0If I get some on me, it would be problematic.\u00a0Xiao Chen hurriedly retreated backward.Earlier, Xiao Chen had attacked the weak spot of the Black Legged Snake. The proverbs say, when attacking, attack where it hurts the most. Although Xiao Chen\u2019s full powered strike did not hack it in two earlier, it still managed to cause severe harm.At this moment, the weapon it relied on, its tail, was severed by Xiao Chen. On top of the previous injury, it was like a tiger without its fangs. It was no longer a danger to Xiao Chen.The Black Legged Snake also understood this. It cried out painfully and its four feet pushed off the ground, launching itself at Xiao Chen with its jaw opened wide. It no longer cared for its own well-being; this was a suicidal attack aimed at taking Xiao Chen down with it.Xiao Chen became sullen. This was the final attack of the Black Legged Snake. Its speed was extremely swift there was no way to evade it. If He could not chop it in half with one move, the counterattack of the Black Legged Snake would cause him severe damage.In the time it took for a spark to fly, Xiao Chen\u2019s mind went black. He recalled the state he had while he practiced his saber technique. He thought to himself slowly,\u00a0Do not panic; just treat it like the wooden pole I normally practice on.\u201cDrawing the Saber!\u201dThe electrical light on his Lunar Shadow Saber shone brightly. When the Black Legged Snake was less than half a meter away, Xiao Chen abruptly made his move. The saber flashed by and the Black Legged Snake was severed in half from its head to the stump of its tail.Xiao Chen rolled to the side and evaded the venomous blood that splashed down. The two halves of the Black Legged Snake landed heavily with a thud.The poisonous cloud in the ravine slowly dissipated. Xiao Chen removed the flannel and headed for the huge rock where the Black Legged Snake had rested earlier. He carefully placed the Seven Leaf Fruit in his Universe Ring.Xiao Chen did not let the corpse of the Black Legged Snake go to waste either. Everything of the Black Legged Snake was considered a treasure. The blackish gold scales of the snake were tough and hard to break, they are great materials for forging Battle Armor.Its four legs can be used to brew wine and refine medicinal pills. They had excellence effects. Xiao Chen took out a sharp knife and cut them off.\u201cWeng Weng!\u201dAfter Xiao Chen packed everything and prepared to get up to leave, he heard a buzzing in his head. Suddenly, he felt dizzy and his limbs go stiff. He was on the verge of collapsing.Crap! The poisonous cloud must have permeated my skin. I have to find a place quickly and expel the poison. Or else, I\u2019ll be in deep trouble.\u201cShua! Shua!\u201dSounds of footsteps came from outside the ravine. Xiao Chen extended his Spiritual Sense. He felt his heart tighten; it was the Jiang Clan\u2019s people; they had not left yet.The sounds of the earlier battle must have alerted them.\u201cIt really is that fellow... to think he actually dares to show himself.\u201d\u201cBecause the First Elder could not manage to find him, he was scolded by the Clan Head severely, causing us to be scolded by the First Elder as well. We have to capture him this time.\u201d\u201cSend the signal; hurry and inform the First Elder and the others.\u201dThese words entered Xiao Chen\u2019s ears. He did his best to keep his eyes open and maintain a clear mind. He looked towards the direction of the ravine and saw ten cultivators, all of which were Martial Masters.\u201cKill!\u201dOne of them shouted loudly; he held a thick machete and rushed towards Xiao Chen. He saw Xiao Chen was only a Superior Grade Martial Disciple. Although he felt something was wrong, he made the first move to gain the credit.\u201cDrawing the Saber!\u201dXiao Chen exhibited the Azure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art to its extreme. His body transformed into a beam of light. Executing the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique, the Lunar Shadow Saber suddenly glowed.There was a flash from the saber and the Jiang Clan cultivator that made a move was struck dead instantly. Xiao Chen looked at the remaining nine Martial Masters. He did not retreat and instead rushed forward, brandishing the Lunar Shadow Saber.\u201cBang!\u201dAfter he took a few steps, the cultivator that was struck suddenly split into two halves and fell to the ground with a thud, spurting out blood.The remaining nine Martial Masters were startled and frightened. They did not expect Xiao Chen, a Superior Grade Martial Disciple, to kill a Martial Master with one strike. This was simply inconceivable.\u201cWhat are we afraid of? No matter how strong he is, he is still just a Superior Grade Martial Disciple. There are nine of us; there is no need to be afraid. Furthermore, the First Elder is on his way. All we have to do is to delay him,\u201d one of the Jiang Clan cultivators told the others.Another of them agreed, \u201cIndeed, there is no need to fear him, just a Superior Grade Martial Disciple. No matter how strong he is, he is still weaker than us by an entire cultivation realm.\u201dXiao Chen did not speak. The situation was dire; he did not dare tarry. He was desperately burning through his Essence. The ten while clouds by the Azure Dragon Martial Spirit were bubbling rapidly, sending the tempered pure Essence to his entire body.\u201cDrawing the Saber!\u201dThe saber flashed and Xiao Chen made another move. Under the execution of the Azure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art, his body moved around gracefully. The cultivator that spoke first was instantly chopped in half.\u201cArclight Chop!\u201d\u201cRushing Heaven Chop!\u201d\u201cRushing Thunder Chop!\u201d\u201cRushing Thunder Second Chain Chop!\u201dWithin the ravine, thunder crackled and the wind strongly blew. Saber lights flew everywhere as Xiao Chen executed the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique with his full strength.Although Xiao Chen was currently a Superior Grade Martial Disciple, he was once a Martial Master.After cultivating for the past few days, the Essence in his body was much purer and stronger than the Jiang Clan cultivators. Furthermore, he had the Heaven Ranked Azure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art Movement Technique and the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique, they were comparable to an Earth Raked Martial Technique. These people were simply no match for Xiao Chen.Each time the saber flashed, someone would die. After the five moves of the Rushing Thunder Saber Technique were used, only four Jiang Clan cultivators remained.The four cultivators could just roughly make out Xiao Chen\u2019s figure; they were not able to see how Xiao Chen instantly killed those six men. Seeing the deathgod-like Xiao Chen, an intent to flee grew in their heart; they made a break for the outside of the ravine.Seeing the four flee, Xiao Chen did not chase after them. He headed out of the ravine. The most important thing for him now was to find a safe place and force the poison out.Because he was circulating his Essence with all his might, the poison in his body was temporarily suppressed. However, this was an extremely dangerous situation. If he was not able to force the poison out before it made a counterattack, the poison would do lethal damage to his body.Just as Xiao Chen left the ravine, he felt a strong aura chasing after him.\u00a0The Jiang Clan\u2019s expert is here; I have to increase my pace.\u201cBrat! Where do you think you can run?\u201dBehind Xiao Chen, the ashen face of the Jiang Clan\u2019s First Elder, Jiang Yunze, appeared and he shouted loudly. He catapulted himself from the ground and landed on a big tree.Leaping off again, he headed towards Xiao Chen. His speed doubled and was actually able to catch up with Xiao Chen, despite his pace. He sent out a palm strike, targeting Xiao Chen\u2019s back.Feeling the palm strike coming, Xiao Chen spun around and sent out a palm strike as well. Although Xiao Chen spat out a mouthful of blood, he borrowed the force from Jiang Yunze\u2019s strike and retreated backward at an even more terrifying speed.Jiang Yunze could not help but feel anger,\u00a0This brat actually used the force of my palm strike to increase the distance between us!\u00a0Thinking back to when he was scolded by Jiang Mingxun the day before, Jiang Yunze shouted lividly and chased after him.Feeling that Jiang Yunze was catching up to him again, \u00a0Xiao Chen complained incessantly in his heart. If it was an ordinary day, he would have left him in the dust already. However, because he had to use his Essence to suppress the poison, he had no way of utilizing the Azure Dragon Cloud Soaring Art to its full extent. His current speed was much slower than usual.I have to think of a way,\u00a0Xiao Chen thought anxiously in his heart. He saw Jiang Yunze get closer and he stopped suddenly. Then, he slowly executed the Gravity Spell.By using the Gravity Spell, he would be slower. However, he would be able to fly into the sky and escape from his pursuers on the ground. Once he was in the sky, whether he would still be targeted or not, Xiao Chen would not care.Jiang Yunze saw Xiao Chen stop suddenly and felt joy in his heart. He increased his pace and rushed towards Xiao Chen. He brandished the saber from behind his back. This time, he would not give Xiao Chen the chance to borrow the force of his attack to escape; he would kill him in a single slash.\u201cHu!\u201dThe saber flashed, and just as the saber was about the hit Xiao Chen, Xiao Chen suddenly rose in the air. The execution of the Gravity Spell was completed. He flew higher and higher, and soon, he was 200 meters above the ground.\u201cIt's actually a flying Martial Technique! What exactly are the origins of this person,\u201d a Jiang Clan cultivator rushed over and uttered in shock as he watched Xiao Chen flying in the sky.Jiang Yunze glared at Xiao Chen with a cold gaze. He said in a sullen voice, \u201cNo matter his origins, he stole the map of the Jiang Clan and injured the First Young Master severely. He has to pay the price for that. Bring me the bow!\u201dA cultivator hurriedly took out a long bow with a cold gleam and handed it to Jiang Yunze. The bow gave off a faint radiance as well as a faint Spiritual Energy.This bow was actually a Spirit Weapon. Jiang Yunze seized an arrow and nocked it. He drew back the bow string till the bow resembled a full moon. A cold gleam flashed on the arrowhead as he aimed at Xiao Chen.\u201cSou!\u201dThe arrow gave off a \u2018weng\u2019 sound as it flew from the bow. It was fast and graceful as it headed towards Xiao Chen. Hearing the sound of the arrow splitting the air, Xiao Chen heaved a long sigh in his heart. Even if he was at his peak, he was not fully confident of evading this arrow.Xiao Chen did his best to dodge to the side, however, this arrow still pierced his right chest. If he had not checked what Jiang Yunze was doing with his Spiritual Sense and knew to dodge, this arrow would have pierced his heart.A bleeding hole, the width of a finger, appeared on his right chest. Blood flowed unceasingly. Xiao Chen hurriedly took out a Blood Replenishing Pill and popped it into his mouth as he felt an unbearable pain.Xiao Chen did his best to maintain the Gravity Spell as he continued to fly forward unsteadily. The poison that had been suppressed started to act. His staggering motions made it look as if he would fall from the sky at any moment.\u201cI finally found you after searching for a week.\u201d Hua Yunfei was standing at the top of a distant tree. He looked extremely handsome with his long hair and clothes fluttering in the wind.He looked at Xiao Chen and exposed a malicious smile. He transformed into a blood river, gushing towards Xiao Chen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
