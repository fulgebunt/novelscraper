Under the starry sky of Cloud Fall Mountain\u2019s summit, the cool breeze blew gently and all was still.Su Luo\u2019s gentle eyes carried a hint of happiness as she tenderly stared at the man before her eyes: \u201cYun Qi, as soon as I quit the organization, we\u2019ll settle down here okay?\u201dYun Qi\u2019s sharp eyebrows and sparking eyes brought about an intoxicating tenderness: \u201cGirl, you\u2019re going to quit just like that?\u201dSu Luo turned around to overlook the distant night sky, then turned around wearing a beautifully bright smile: \u201cIn these past ten or so years, if I wasn\u2019t training, I\u2019d be killing while always on the verge of life and death. There wasn\u2019t even a peaceful day. Now I\u2019m already weary of this kind of lifestyle so I want to hurry up and break away from it. Don\u2019t tell me that you don\u2019t think the same?\u201dWhile speaking, Su Luo took out a small brocade box and waved it in front of Yun Qi: \u201cGuess, what\u2019s in here?\u201dSu Luo\u2019s eyes sparkled as her expression filled with happiness.Immersed in the future beautiful life she yearned for, she did not see a treacherous radiance flash in Yun Qi\u2019s eyes.\u201cThe Dragon Ring? So you\u2019ve already gotten a hold of it? How could it be possible? When did this happen?\u201d Yun Qi\u2019s up turned eyes narrowed with an intoxicating gentleness.\u201cRight when you were still on your mission in the West, I was lucky, so I got it. So now, you\u2019ll quit with me, okay? Su Luo held Yun Qi\u2019s hand with hopeful eyes, \u201cAfter returning the Dragon Ring to the organization, we\u2019ll then settle down here and happily live our lives here, okay?\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d He gently kissed Su Luo\u2019s smooth forehead and forcefully held her within his bosom as he tightly embraced her.As she nestled on his collarbone, Su Luo closed her eyes and blissfully smiled.They were childhood sweethearts of ten or so years who had hand in hand, walked through a hail of bullets. He was her most important family member, and also the person she trusted the most. She has already conceived his baby now, so once they quit the organization\u2026. All of a sudden, Su Luo\u2019s entire body stiffened as her confused eyes filled with bitter pain. She opened her eyes wide with incredulous despair.She pushed Yun Qi away and looked down.A sharp dagger had pierced through her chest. As blood unceasing flowed out from the dagger to wet the thin white skirt, the blood spilling out from the chest was similar a Red Spider Lily in full bloom; passionate yet strange.As an assassin, the accuracy of Yun Qi\u2019s dagger did not have the slightest trace of error.Su Luo stumbled to kneel on the ground filled with unorderly crushed rocks as her beautiful eyes brimmed with surprised despair and disbelief. She honestly did not think that the man she trusted the most, who claimed that he loved her, would ruthlessly send her a dagger as her birthday present and stab her in the back!The execution was emotionless and relentless.Why\u2026. She opened her mouth but could not utter a single sound because of her despair.Yun Qi coldly ridiculed her as the corner of his mouth curled up: \u201cSu Luo, you\u2019re an absolute idiot. You know too many of the organization\u2019s secrets, did you really think that the organization would let you off? And to even think about quitting, you\u2019re too naive! Not only that, you\u2019re so naive that you would believe that I\u2019d actually quit with you?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d Su Luo bitterly smiled in despair.As per Yun Qi\u2019s words, she really was too naive to actually believe that he would quit the organization with her.\u201cDon\u2019t be this stupid in your next life!\u201d Yun Qi picked up the small brocade box that fell on the floor. After coldly glancing at the hopelessly suffering Su Luo, he turned around decidedly left.\u201cYun Qi, are you sure you\u2019re not too naive?\u201d Su Luo\u2019s cold voice resounded behind his back.Yun Qi halted in his steps as Su Luo suddenly laughed out loud: \u201cWhat did you think was in that brocade box?\u201d Yun Qi opened the brocade box and his complexion suddenly changed, \u201cWhere\u2019s the Dragon Ring? Where\u2019d you hide it?\u201dThere was a wealthy employer who put forth three billion US dollars and entrusted the organization to look for this Dragon Ring. If it could not be found in the end, not only would they not receive the money, the organization\u2019s reputation would also be severely tarnished.Su Luo stood on the edge of the steep cliff and looked down at the deep darkness. The corner of her mouth revealed a satisfied yet bleak smile that was as beautiful as the unstable blooming of a Queen of the Night: \u201cYun Qi, you\u2019ll never be able to obtain the Dragon Ring. Also, don\u2019t bother to cry at my tombstone or else you\u2019ll taint my reincarnation cycle.\u201dWhile speaking, Su Luo abruptly leapt and her entire person plunged down into the darkness of the cliff.And beneath the cliff, were raging waves of seawater that beat against the shore.\\nNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was so painful that her heart had almost stopped beating.In a daze, she slowly opened her heavy eyelids. Seeing the dirty white gauze mosquito net above her head and a shabby quilt, she momentarily could not react.\u201cSu Luo you cheap slut, why aren\u2019t you dead yet? Why did you even bother to wake up! Die die die!\u201d A sharp, ear-piercing voice furiously shouted near Su Luo\u2019s bed.Su Luo realized that she was strengthless from head to toe. She weakly turned towards the direction of the voice.There was a beautiful girl who looked to be around fourteen or fifteen years of age dressed in light purple fine gauze. Inserted in her hair that was rolled up in a bun was a precious butterfly hairpin and a jade hairpin. Her small face was slightly round and she had very delicate facial features.The little girl was very beautiful, yet she was very malicious in her actions. At the moment, she was holding a needle that was usually used to sew the soles of a shoe. The needle was thick and glinted in the cold light.With a sinister look in her eyes, she ruthlessly stabbed at Su Luo\u2019s body. She stabbed at the flesh hidden underneath the clothes so unless someone tore them open, outsiders would never be able to see them.So painful! This is simply torture!Su Luo wanted to say something, but discovered that her mouth had been gagged by a rag. She wanted to resist, but found out that she didn\u2019t even have the strength to lift a single finger.Seeing that Su Luo had awoken, the malicious girl turned to face the other slightly larger girl and coldly commanded: \u201cThird Sister, quickly beat, quickly beat her to death!\u201dSubsequently, this Third Miss did what she was told and forcefully swung the palm of her hand to slap Su Luo\u2019s face.Su Luo\u2019s eyes gleamed with a frosty light: This maltreatment, these slaps; I, Su Luo, will remember all of them!Su Luo could no longer take the continuous assault and finally sank into the darkness.\u201cMiss\u2026. Uuu\u2026. Miss, you must not die\u2026..\u201d The sound of the young female\u2019s mournful weeping was miserable and it seemed that her throat had become hoarse due to her weeping.Awakened by the sound of weeping and feeling that someone was forcefully shaking her, Su Luo faintly woke up.\u201cM-Miss?\u201d Lu Luo who was sadly weeping raised her gaze and met Su Luo\u2019s line of sight. Accompanied by the eye contact, her face immediately turned to that of pleasant surprise.At this time, Su Luo also clearly saw the little girl before her eyes. She was approximately fourteen or fifteen years of age with facial features that could be considered to be graceful, but at the moment, her face was covered with red and swollen fingerprints. Both eyes swelled like a peach and she appeared to be in a tight spot.Her vision shifted to the interior of the room. She discovered that the table was missing a leg, the chair was worn-out, and there wasn\u2019t even a cup to drink water from the teapot. It seemed as if the entire room was a house in the slums of Africa.Suddenly, Su Luo mind ached as memories flooded in like the surging of the tide.Looks like she really did cross over.This place was not a dynasty that she was familiar with, for was the Blue Sky Continent that never appeared in China\u2019s history and was a world that respected those with martial might.The continent consisted of four countries. They were individually named Eastern Ling, Western Jin, Southern Feng, and Northern Mo. Together, the four countries drew a circle and in between them, was the legendary Dark Forest that was rampant with magic beasts. Unless one was a martial artist, entering was simply unthinkable.As of now, Su Luo was in the Manor of the Eastern Ling Empire\u2019s Great General. Her father was Su Zian, the Great General who protected the empire and she, was the publically known strawbag fool of an idiot, the good-for-nothing Fourth Miss.In the Blue Sky Continent, every child had to take an innate talent test at the age of five and this exam was so important that it was enough to determine a person\u2019s entire life.Before this exam, Su Luo was the pride of the Su Family because at during her birth, even the heavens intervened with worldly phenomenons; a multicolored sky paved the roads in rainbow as a divine bird circled around the entire imperial capital. At that time, everyone believed that Su Family\u2019s Fourth Miss would become someone of importance.But on the day of the aptitude test five years later, this Su Family\u2019s Fourth Miss who most had the greatest of expectations for, unexpectedly appeared to be nobody. Her innate talent was at a good-for-nothing zero and it was fundamentally impossible for her to practice martial arts!As a result of the expectations being too high with the disparity too wide, Su Zian threw Su Luo into the side courtyard under a fit of rage, leaving Su Luo to decide her own life and death. Su Luo\u2019s mother had also been abandoned and finally perished from depression.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Su Luo gazed at the slow moving white cloud as a trace of a grim smile flashed in her eyes.During the modern age, she, Su Luo had experienced ten or so years of the devil\u2019s training. Even if her innate talent was zero, she could still break through and a piece of the sky would one day be hers!She still recalled what had happened the day she crossed over, that scene of the two girls torturing her.\u201cMiss, Third Miss and Fifth Miss are taking a stroll in the gardens. The two did not bring any maids and I do not know what they are discussing.\u201d Lu Luo entered carrying a small box, placed it on the table and took out the dishes one by one to arrange them on the table.A plate of rotting vegetable leaves, a bowl of molding dried tofu, and two bowls of rice.\u201cNot eating, I\u2019m stepping out first.\u201d Su Luo pushed away the bowl and chopsticks as a hint of coldness flashed through her eyes. She, Su Luo had no skill aside from her love of holding grudges. And if a grudge existed it most certainly, must be avenged.Inside the Flower Garden, Third Miss Su Wan and Fifth Miss Su Xi strolled along the Lotus Pond.Fifth Miss Su Xi was born from the first wife so her status was high. Her innate talent had also astonished many at a young age; she was the darling of the entire Su Family.Like Su Luo, Third Miss Su Wan was born from a mistress but her mouth was sweet and she usually used it to fawn over Su Xi. She gave priority to Su Xi so the two appeared to have quite a good relationship.A faint sound came from Su Wan: \u201cFifth Younger Sister, I heard that damned girl woke up again?\u201dSu Xi sneered: \u201cHer life is so cheap but when poisoned, she wasn\u2019t poisoned to death and when beaten, she wasn\u2019t beaten to dead. How hateful!\u201dSu Wan asked again: \u201cThen what do we do? Doesn\u2019t it mean that the marriage is still\u2026.\u201dSu Xi fiercely fisted: \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, I\u2019ll definitely kill her next time!\u201dAt the moment, they were walking along the Lotus Pond. Su Xi walked along the inside while Su Wan walked on the outer side.Su Luo held a stalk of rice straw in her mouth as she listened in to their discussion that plotted against her life. A glimmer of coldness flashed through her eyes. She\u2019d like to see who would dare mess with her again!I heard that Su Xi\u2019s innate talent was extremely high and was already at the second step of the Warrior. Although she did not have the ability to take her revenge now, collecting a little bit of interest was no problem at all.Su Luo hid behind the parasol tree as her eyes slyly gleamed.With a whip of her sleeve, a small pebble coincidentally tumbled near Su Wan\u2019s foot.Su Wan faced forward, so why would she take into account what was underneath her foot? She took a step and her balance immediately became unstable as she swayed in Su Xi\u2019s direction.When one was about to fall, they would inevitably activate their instinct of grabbing anything near them that they could possibly hold on to, and Su Wan was fortunate enough to firmly grasp at Su Xi\u2019s sleeve.What was quite unfortunate was when the two stumbled and tried to regain their balance, a shadowless foot suddenly kicked Su Wan in the buttocks!The assault that came out of the blue took Su Wan by surprise so she once again, firmly grabbed onto Su Xi\u2019s dress.Suddenly, the pair flew towards the canal with a bang and heavily fell in while looking like drowned rats.As for Su Luo, she had already returned to hide behind the parasol tree with both hands clutching her chest as her eyes flowed with bright lights and vibrant colors. She waited there to watch the good show.She want to see how marvelous the internal conflict between two close collaborators would be.In this unexpected accident, Su Xi was actually an innocent bystander. But who told her to stubbornly want to offend the Su Luo who should never be offended?She had been dragged in by Su Wan and plunged head first into the water. Her disposition was originally that of a pampered child so she immediately shouted in anger and swung her hand: \u201cThird Elder Sister, what are you doing? Slipping and falling on your own is fine but why\u2019d you have to drag me in with you!!!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But she was certain that she fell into the canal because someone had ruthlessly kicked her bottom.Su Wan tightly head onto the right cheek that had been slapped and cried without tears: \u201cFifth Younger Sister, it\u2019s not that I wanted to fall, someone kicked me.\u201dSu Xi sneered: \u201cWe\u2019re the only two here, who did you think kicked you? Why haven\u2019t you gone up there and given me a cloak to wear?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d Su Wan miserably lowered her eyelids.The gauze fairy robe was now tightly plastered on her body and her figure was clearly displayed in such fine detail that her inner red undergarments were distinctly seen. If she went out like this and was seen by someone, wouldn\u2019t she lose too much face?\u201cHow about we call for someone?\u201d Su Wan weakly proposed after thinking for quite a while as she held her head.\u201cNo! If a man answered our call, what will we ever do if we\u2019ve been completely seen? Go quickly!\u201d Su Xi had cruelty written all over her face!\u201cN, no\u2026.\u201d Su Wan desperately shook her head and refused to agree no matter what.\u201cThen strip off your clothes and give them to me for me to wear!\u201d Su Xi panted with rage and started to pull at Su Wan\u2019s outer clothing.\u201cFifth little sister, stop, please stop\u2026.\u201d Su Wan tightly hugged her stomach, as if she was unwilling to let go even if she died. She only had one layer of outer gauze and inside that were her undergarments!\u201cThen why don\u2019t you hurry and go?!\u201d Su Xi relentlessly pushed Su Wan in the direction of land.The Su Wan standing ashore with her clothes plastered all over her body had her two little grapes blown by the wind. They immediately became erect by the wind as if they were arrogant warlords.She shivered due to the cold and ran as if her life depended on it.However, at the same time, it was not known why but the trees suddenly ignited in flames.Distant cries sounded out: \u201cFire\u2026. The trees are on fire\u2026. Quickly, we must extinguish the fire\u2026.\u201dThe little grove just happened to be near the lotus pond. Its surroundings were obvious at a glance. There were no fake hills or fake stones; it was fundamentally impossible to take cover.Soon after, a countless number of people bounded in that direction. Scared out of her wits, Su Wan paled as both of her hands protected her chest and quickly spun around in place.\u201cRun! Run quickly!\u201d Su Xi loudly urged from within the lotus pond. If you don\u2019t run now, it\u2019ll be too late!But it was already too late now.The sound of numerous footsteps closing in was heard afterwards. Su Wan trembled in fright and she subconsciously went in the direction of the canal to jump in once more.With a bang, the splashing of waves rose high in the air.Su Luo almost laughed out loud.But this decision of Su Wan\u2019s shouldn\u2019t be considered to be foolish. After all, the pond\u2019s water wasn\u2019t deep and one could stand in it with both legs. Not only that, within the pond bloomed many water lilies. If they hid behind them, if one wasn\u2019t seriously trying to find them there, it was extremely unlikely for others to discover them.\u201cWhy did you come in again!\u201d Su Xi raged so hard that her hair almost stood up on end. She swung heavily to slap at Su Wan\u2019s face.Su Wan was also unhappy: \u201cFifth little sister, don\u2019t be so unreasonable!\u201d She should also be a little angry, right?Su Xi viciously glared: \u201cUnreasonable? Who\u2019s unreasonable? If you didn\u2019t drag me in here, would I be in this situation? You. Keep this in mind, once I get out, I\u2019ll definitely will not let you off!\u201d\u201cBut I didn\u2019t do it on purpose, someone really did push me in!\u201d\u201cWho pushed you, I\u2019d like you to bring them out for me to see!\u201dIgnoring the numerous footsteps, the two sisters started to immediately quarrel in the canal.With an evil smile, Su Luo coldly watched this hard to come by show of the two sister\u2019s savage fight. She looked forward to what would follow next on this program, for it would certainly be marvelous. Only then would it not waste the fire that she had run to set.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His beautiful face slightly curled up into a curve as his intelligent eyes brimmed with overflowing interest; one hundred percent interest.It seems like today\u2019s visit to the Great General\u2019s Manor was indeed not a bad decision. Chancing upon this sort of show was actually unexpected. He was never aware of the fact that the Great General\u2019s daughters were so amusing.The rumored stupid idiot was actually this quick-witted and clever; and the one who was typically praised to the skies had been reduced to such a state.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s gazed travelled towards Su Luo\u2019s direction and rubbed at his bright and clean chin in interest.This girl was so young, but her mind was extremely clever to produce such a crafty scheme. Her skills were pretty good to look at too.As for her appearance\u2026. Nangong Liuyun examined this girl in detail.No more than fourteen or fifteen with a careless smile on her face. A pair of charmingly beautiful clear eyes that flowed with brilliant light and vibrant colors. But there was a separate layer inside her eyes that reflected a grim determined darkness. It was as dark as an abyss and it also appeared to be impossible for one to tread into the depths of her heart.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s eyes flashed with a trace of playfulness, he arrived at a conclusion: This girl is definitely sinisterly cunning, enjoys plotting against others, likes to hide in secret places from others, and she was a person who would still wear that slight smile even if she killed another person.She was precisely the same as him, it was just too interesting.Although Nangong Liuyun suddenly sensed that he found one of the same type, a wonderful feeling of finding the similar type of person that could only be found after searching everywhere throughout the entire world, this kind of unprecedented feeling he had towards Su Luo made him immediately brim with interest.At the moment, Su Luo suddenly sensed a trace of wrongness. She discovered that there appeared to be a scorching gaze that firmly locked upon her.Su Luo raised her head to scout, only to discover an impeccably handsome youngster reclining atop the tallest parasol tree with a playful arc that curled at the corner of his mouth.Only to see him dressed in a gorgeous white robe with light phoenix-like eyes that slightly narrowed. He was an unrivaled beauty of the mortal world and on his face, the curled corners of his mouth evoked a demonic charm. He was reclining against the tree\u2019s highest branch and was supported atop it. The blossoms of pure white translucent Snowball gently fluttered about from the Snowball tree. That scenery was as romantic as it was beautiful, and at the moment, he resembled a pretty boy who had just came out of a manhua.His bright eyes were clear and penetrating, as if he clearly understood everything. While his gaze stared fixedly at Su Luo, the corners of his mouth carried a trace of a charmingly wicked smile, and the meaning behind this smiling expression seemed to be rather deep.\u201cSee something good?\u201d He opened his mouth and asked, with an expression that seemed to contain pure joy.Although these were merely three words, it held a double entendre.He could be referring to this amusing play or it was possible that he was asking whether his looks were good, or perhaps he was asking about both.Su Luo narrowed her eyes.When did this guy appear? Before or after she came here? She actually did not sense him at all.Was her vigilance too low, or is it that his martial art cultivation was too high? Since she knew that she was always on guard, it must be that his martial arts were too high.The corner of Su Luo\u2019s mouth slowly bent as she coldly replied, \u201cSeen enough?\u201dIn regards to a person who had appeared without being invited but still was calm and unruffled while watching her play, Su Luo possessed a trace of hostility.Surprise flashed in Nangong Liuyun\u2019s heart and his pitch-black inky phoenix eyes met with Su Luo\u2019s beautiful eyes. All of a sudden, he discovered that the frequency of the pulsing heartbeat within his chest became a bit faster than its former speed.The corners of his mouth sketched a playful smile: \u201cWhat a treacherously sinister woman.\u201dSu Luo slightly raised her eyebrows. Wearing a smile that was not yet a smile, she answered in turn: \u201cWhat a gentlemanly man of high morals.\u201dA blossoming laugh came from Nangong Liuyun after hearing Su Luo\u2019s retort. It was a gentle and melodic low sound that was demonically charming, \u201cNo, no, this king is the same kind of person you are.\u201dSu Luo once again sneered at his implication, which also meant that she was sneering at herself.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Come? If she came after he had told her to come over, wouldn\u2019t she lose a lot of face?What\u2019s more, the forking branch on that tree barely had any space, where would she sit if she went over there? Could it be that he wanted her to sit on his lap?But before she reached a conclusion, the scene before her suddenly blurred, her body moved, and in another blink of an eye, she was already atop the tree. Not only that, she was actually settled within the arms of this man she had just met!How could Su Luo possibly let someone else take advantage of her whenever they pleased? She subconsciously lifted her dagger to slice at the other party\u2019s artery in the neck \u2014\u2014 However, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s reaction ought to be considered to be quite fast. Su Luo\u2019s hand had not even streaked across, and he had already single-handedly forced her hand behind her back.This posture, caused Su Luo\u2019s well-rounded bosom to stand erect as it impressively bulged and swelled.Su Luo had never expected such a large discrepancy between her martial arts and this guy\u2019s. She was right in front of him, but she could not even deal one blow!Nangong Liuyun laughed with unrestrained wickedness. His slender and smooth finger leisurely stroked Su Luo\u2019s creaming complexion. His elegantly pink lips lifted into a wicked smile as it carried a hint of unbridled arrogant air.\u201cGirl, the current you is no match for this king. What, do you still want to continue?\u201d Nangong Liuyan\u2019s rich and low voice carried a trace of wicked charm that was extremely pleasant to hear.\u201cLet me go!\u201d Su Luo warned in a stern but low voice because in the corner of her eyes, she saw that the approaching people had almost arrived.\u201cGirl, we\u2019re free and bored, how about we play a game?\u201d Nangong Liuyun happily asked in his enchanting low voice as his eyes filled with pure interest.Su Luo cautiously thought about it and thought that it wouldn\u2019t be different from what was happening now, so she coldly nodded: \u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s gamble on the two in that pond, if they could hide without being discovered, it would be your win. If they cannot avoid discovery, it would be this king\u2019s win. How about it?\u201d\u201cWhat would be at stake?\u201d Su Luo was extremely poor, so she couldn\u2019t gamble with money, but she could use a sleight of hand.\u201cWinner is king, loser\u2026. warms the bed?\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s eyes pricked in extreme interest at his own proposal.Su Luo\u2019s expression chilled. She coldly glanced at Nangong Liuyun with an frank expression, as if she was looking at an idiot.Nangong Liuyun looked hurt as he covered his chest and weakly suggested: \u201cWinner lies down\u2026. loser falls down?\u201dSu Luo was completely speechless! Was this man not the least bit ashamed? It\u2019s only the first time they\u2019ve met, alright? It was the first time they have ever spoken, but how could he be so frank? Even she, a modern woman, felt herself blush.\u201cThis won\u2019t do, and that also won\u2019t do.\u201dNangong Liuyun languidly fiddled with the hair beside her ear as he spoke in a calm and composed manner, \u201cCould it be that you insist on the winner being king\u2026 and the loser becoming queen? If you insist, that is also something not impossible.\u201dSu Luo rolled her eyes in displeasure.\u201cBecome king, become queen. You\u2019re not the crown prince right? Yet you\u2019re not worried about the wind of rumors cutting your tongue.\u201d Su Luo coldly ridiculed him with a roll of her eyes and bluntly said: \u201cIs it really that complicated over there? If I win, you\u2019ll have to owe me a favor. If I lose\u2026.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to give this king a kiss.\u201d Nangong Liuyun quickly answered with not one bit of loss.Why does this man act as if he\u2019ll die if he doesn\u2019t get to take advantage of me? I seriously want to give him a good thrashing!Su Luo glared and as a result, allowed him to clearly see her rage.His eyes laughed with careless leisure, but at the same time, it contained a kind of incomparable sharpness that he was unable to conceal. This person effortlessly released an air that suppresses another and exuded an aura of a domineering king.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just a mere kiss can\u2019t hurt right? The modern her played around sometimes, so it wasn\u2019t as if she wasn\u2019t experienced.The current her didn\u2019t have anything and just happened to need a sucker to drop in her door.Thus, the two treacherous male and female with ulterior motives began their first confrontation.Su Jingyu\u2019s party hurriedly approached.Su Jingyu was the eldest son of the Su Family. Born from the first lady with a not too shabby innate talent; he was twenty years old yet was already a third step expert, a level that most of the younger generation wished to be at.He didn\u2019t come alone but instead brought along a formidable group of people. The spectacle was quite grand.Su Xi was mad to the point of no return but there was no way out of the situation. Fearful of exposing any clue of her being there, she hid her entire body behind the lotus flowers. In her heart, she had already yelled at Su Wan to within an inch of her life.She never expected that she, Su Xi, would one day be put in such a difficult situation!If the one coming was only Su Jingyu, then it was fine, but he just had to bring along His Highness, the crown prince, and other sons of various noble families. If she were to go out now and was seen by them while looking like this, it was guaranteed that not even a quarter of an hour would pass before news of this would spread throughout the entire imperial capital. When that time comes, how could she, Su Xi, ever intermingle with others in the imperial capital?Su Xi furiously glared at Su Wan and pledged that after she goes out, she would never let this Su Wan bitch get away with it!Su Wan was also mad to the point of being half dead. She too, never expected that her luck to take a turn for the worse.The situation before her eyes was taking a turn for the worse and the people who were coming were increasing by the moment. If they were to be discovered like this\u2026. should they say that they were taking a swim?But it was spring, and not even summer.What to do, what exactly should she do? Su Wan\u2019s anxiousness was comparable to disorderly ants.Su Luo curled the corner of her mouth into a contemplating smile as she looked at the entourage of youngsters in bright clothes.This was actually unexpected. She never would have thought that the crowd of people who came over would actually let Su Xi and Su Wan rack their brains, to then stealthily shrink back behind the lotus flowers. Su Luo then understood that the status of those in that group ought to be considerably high.The one at the head ought to be the crown prince. He wore a brocade robe of canary yellow with a soaring dragon on his belt. His eyebrows seemed to be meticulously groomed, and his high bridged nose was above thin pale lips that were curled up to display an incomparably privileged air of haughtiness. As he wore this unbridled arrogant flair, he appeared to be both cruel and soft. It only took one look to see that his temper was not good.Su Jingyu wore a dark green brocade robe with a crystal jade belt. He had a bright handsome face, sharp eyebrows and starry eyes, but at the moment, his eyebrows were tightly knitted into an unpleased expression.The crown prince bursted into laughter after seeing the small fire: \u201cJingyu, what is your manor doing? Isn\u2019t this just playing with fire?\u201dThis was not limited to just the crown prince. The younger male generation of various noble families that were behind the crown prince also began to laugh immediately afterwards.Because what was before them was a truth that was indeed worthy of being called a joke. Not only that, it only took a glance to clearly see that it was deliberately done on purpose.Where was the fire here? It was clearly a hoax.What was present before their eyes now, was just a medium sized bonfire. It was burning atop a pile of withered grass that was easily combustible, and was covered with a layer of fresh green leaves. It was known to all that if wood was not completely dried in the sun, the plume of smoke would be especially large after a period of ignition. And in doing so, it was obvious that the other party had done this to lure them here.At this time, Su Jingyu also had some suspicions in his heart. The pretty space between his eyebrows opened up as he broke into a smile and said to the crown prince, \u201cIt\u2019s probably a servant who accidentally started this.\u201dThe crown prince stroked his chin as his gaze swept back and forth at the scene before him: \u201cOh? The General Manor\u2019s servants are actually this heaven-daringly audacious?\u201dSu Jingyu\u2019s heart stopped, and then hurriedly explained: \u201cIt could also be the result of my younger sister\u2019s playful mischief. Since it is alright now, let\u2019s go back? Jingyu is a bit unsure of the homework Teacher assigned today, and it just so happens that I could ask Your Highness, the crown prince, for a bit of guidance.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This matter was too strange. He had a hunch that if he stayed here any longer, something he wouldn\u2019t want to see would occur.The crown prince and him both studied at the imperial captial\u2019s Advanced Institute and were even in the same department. The two were in the wind element department. With that added to Su Jingyu\u2019s painstakingly ass-kissing, he and the crown prince had become close as a result and was already in the crown prince\u2019s clique.The crown prince laughed bleakly: \u201cTo have the impertinence to play this kind of prank in the Great General\u2019s Manor, they truly have a heavens amount of nerve to do so. Jingyu, you must investigate this closely.\u201dThe five surrounded the highest tree\u2019s forking branch as the lush vegetation hid Su Luo and Nangong Liuyun\u2019s figures. The two\u2019s breathing were extremely light, so they had not discovered them yet.Suddenly, Su Luo felt warmth at her nape. A hot lingering breath near the edge of her earlobe.Before she had time to react, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s low voice playfully asked: \u201cDo you want to see an even more marvelous scene?\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Su Luo shifted her body forward and looked up at him from a distance as she turned her head around to look at his shiny glittering eyes that glinted with resplendent starlight.His phoenix-like eyes now resembled the luster of seawater, calm and serene. The delicate skin on his face was as beautiful as porcelain china. It was as if he was one of Shangri-la\u2019s exiled immortals; allowed to look at, but not allowed to be trifled with.Nangong Liuyun sized up the girl before his eyes at a close range.Bright eyes white teeth, creamy white skin, a small face without any makeup that could defeat one that wore it, looks as if she was the morning dew of spring\u2019s sunshine and was a refreshing person. Especially those eyes that contained a stream of sparkling water; when her beautiful eyes wandered, they brimmed with a touching vividness.Her eyes were clear and indifferent while her expression had an even more prominent apathy to it. The corner of her mouth was curled into a cold arc like a white cloud that had transformed into misty nothingness. She was like the calm tide without the slightest ripple or wave.A thought suddenly flashed in Nangong Liuyun\u2019s mind. If I smash this deep tranquility in her eyes, wouldn\u2019t that be quite amusing?All of a sudden, he raised his strong and powerful slender arm, and used the other white and smooth finger to lift Su Luo\u2019s pointy chin as the thick shadow of vegetation covered Su Luo.And it was at this critical moment that Su Luo used a mere palm to separate his and her lips.\u201cThe game\u2019s outcome has not been decided yet, why are you so anxious?\u201d With a smile that was not yet a smile, Su Luo took a sidelong glance before asking that in a low voice.\u201cOutcome? That would only take a thought.\u201d The edge of Nangong Liuyun\u2019s pink lips perked up into a playful smiling expression. He slightly raised his dense sword-like eyebrows and stopped moving. Suddenly, a screech came from not too far away.At this moment, the crown prince and Su Jingyu had already turned around. But they had only walked a few steps before hearing a sharp painful shout from the lotus pond area that momentarily stopped every one of their footsteps.Su Luo was puzzled. She looked into the distance and saw a clear vision of fresh blood on Su Wan\u2019s forehead. She couldn\u2019t help but be stupefied in place for a moment. Afterwards, she turned to glare at Nangong Liuyun as she gritted her teeth in extreme anger with a pause in each word: \u201cYou. Cheat. Ted!\u201d\u201cWas there a rule that said we can\u2019t cheat?\u201d Nangong Liuyun started to shamelessly act dumb.Su Luo helplessly rolled her eyes at Nangong Liuyun, but the guy actually let out a resplendent light laugh. The handsome face that was beautiful beyond compare was similar to a Queen of the Night in full bloom, an alluring rare sight.The Su Wan who had been hit by a pebble subconsciously screamed out loud. She covered her bleeding head as her entire body almost jumped up from the shock.She\u2019s seriously a pig! And was the most stupid one too!Su Xi was so angry that she wished she could slap this Third Elder Sister, who had attracted trouble after trouble to her, to death. She originally believed that today\u2019s misfortunes had be enough, but never expected that the god of bad luck would still be so kind to her!\u201cWho\u2019s there?!\u201d Su Jingyu asked in a loud voice towards the empty lotus pond.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He stared unblinkingly at the lotus pond with sparkling eyes.\u201cCome out! If you don\u2019t come out, I\u2019ll attack!\u201d Su Jingyu stood in front of the crown prince to protect him, ready to attack the enemy at anytime.As expected, this kind of action gained a favorable impression from the crown prince. He patted Su Jingyu on the shoulder, indicating that he could deal with this by himself.Inside the lotus pond.At the moment, Su Xi was at a complete loss. If she came out now in front of the crown prince, she would lose too much face. She had coveted the title of Crown Princess for a very long time. If she came out now, she would never possess it.Fine, since this disaster had been caused by Third Sister, then she\u2019ll have to personally go settle this herself.\u201cAfter they leave, remember to give me that cloak! Or else I\u2019ll beat you to death!\u201d After being in the water for so long, Su Xi\u2019s lips somewhat trembled. After saying that, she lifted Su Wan\u2019s belt and tossed her ashore.Su Wan\u2019s \u201cAhhh\u2014\u2014\u201d was similar to a dying pig\u2019s screech. She carried water droplets on her body as she flew across the sky in an arc until finally falling to the ground with a bang. Her jade body laid in a disarray on the bank as she completely wet the ground\u2019s soil.What was even more unfortunate was that her belt had been pulled out by Su Xi. She was originally relaxed but now that she had encountered such a loss and landed on the ground for a period of time, her belt dispersed as the front of her clothes immediately opened to suddenly reveal the bright red undergarments inside her clothing and her slender jade legs.The undergarment that covered her chest was opened wide in exposure as the jade peaks of her bosom\u2019s mountains became faintly discernible, and invited crime.Su Jingyu\u2019s eyes were wide open. It was simple unbelievable! His mouth was opened so wide that even an hen\u2019s egg could be stuffed in.No matter what, he never would\u2019ve expected why his third younger sister would suddenly appear on the bank, and would even appear in such a humiliating way. What\u2019s more, she appear like this in front of the crown prince.Could it be that she was expressing her feelings of affection for the crown prince this way?This is simply just\u2026 simply just\u2026. too shameless!Blue veins popped up on Su Jingyu\u2019s forehead. He took off his outer clothing and tossed it onto Su Wan\u2019s body and covered up that shameless body as he roared coldly: \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you gotten up yet?\u201dHe felt like he had never lost this much face in front of the crown prince before and now, he felt like his face had combusted.Unfortunately, Su Wan did not answer his words. She still laid in the same place in front of everyone as they stood in a circle and watched, because at the moment, Su Wan had already fainted.\u201cYour Highness, my younger sister\u2019s mischief has stirred up trouble and has accidentally offended you. By all means, please do not be offended.\u201d Su Jingyu gnawed his back teeth and forced himself to adopt a rigid smiling expression as he tried to mediate the situation.He said that on one side as he gestured at his servants to hurriedly carry his third younger sister on the other.The crown prince heartily laughed and appeared to be in a joyful mood. He clapped Su Jingyu on the shoulder like an older brother and smiled: \u201cThat was your family\u2019s astonishingly gifted little sister? The way she came out was quite\u2026. Hmm, special?\u201dThe crown prince had actually seen Su Xi before, but because Su Wan had been flung up, her face had been covered with disheveled hair. Since she had crawled up like a water ghost, the crown prince had not distinctively seen her face before Su Jingyu covered Su Wan\u2019s face with his robe.So the crown prince did not actually see which Su Manor\u2019s young Miss it was.But the words the crown prince had said, had their own intentions.The words the crown prince had said made Su Xi, who was in the lotus pond, become so depressed that she raged with fire! She angrily stomped her foot in the water.What\u2019s wrong with the crown prince\u2019s eyes, that was obviously Third Elder Sister alright? How could it be her, Su Xi! Even though she was secretly happy that the crown prince had remembered her, how could she forgive that he had mistaken that sorry of a figure for her.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

My fifth younger sister is gentle and ladylike with an extraordinary innate talent. She doesn\u2019t even have enough time to cultivate so how could she be mischievous enough to cause trouble.\u201dA peculiar light flashed through the crown prince\u2019s eyes: \u201cOh? Then who that was the one earlier?\u201dSu Jingyu was at a loss. He secretly scolded himself for being a dumbass, why did he say that it was one of his family\u2019s sisters and not just randomly blame one of the servant girls? Now that the crown prince is looking into the matter, how was he going to respond?Father always regarded Third Sister highly. Not only that, Third Sister was always close with his mother and sister. If it was possible to not sacrifice her, he mustn\u2019t offer her up to be slaughtered.All of a sudden, a bright light sparked in Su Jingyu mind as he realized a way in which he could get the best of both worlds. Due to his emotional excitement, he slightly raised his voice: \u201cActually\u2026. I won\u2019t keep Your Highness in the dark, that girl is in fact\u2026. actually\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou talk and break off again as if you\u2019re unwilling to speak the truth. Don\u2019t tell me that girl is actually\u2026.\u201d The crown prince\u2019s deep abyssal eyes flickered as his voice lowered and appeared to carry some sort of suggestion.\u201cYes, Your Highness is brilliant. That girl is in fact my good-for-nothing Fourth Sister!\u201d After Su Jingyu said those words, he immediately relaxed and felt as if the sky had brightened. Even the gently blowing wind had a fresh and clean smell to it.Fourth Sister?The Su Luo who sat atop the forking branch seriously wanted to explode and burst into obscene language.Her rigid elder brother, who was suppose to be a person of high morals, was actually this shameless! To actually blame this on an innocent, dragged her into it, and made her a scapegoat! And even said that the scandalous person was actually her!Now she finally understood where her notorious reputation came from. As long as any one of the sisters made an error, they would tell outsiders that it was her fault and fasten the culprit hat on top of her head.Su Luo\u2019s eyes glittered with frost and snow. They were infused with a deep cold radiance. Good, very good. Su Jingyu you have been put into memory by this lady. This lady here is extremely petty. As for this vengance, just you wait.Nangong Liuyun looked at the girl\u2019s flickering complexion in amusement as his rosy-red lips perked up into a smile. His abnormally enchanting low voice carried a hint of sensuality: \u201cGirl, you\u2019re not going out there to clear up the misunderstanding?\u201d\u201cIf I go out now, that big brother of mine would certainly be startled, then dismiss me as if I was a servant girl. Would you believe that?\u201d Su Luo\u2019s smile was as beautiful as a flower while her white teeth glinted with a cold radiance.\u201cBut if you don\u2019t go out, this crown princess position of yours would never be considered. Would you believe that? Nangong Liuyun\u2019s red lips were the color of blood; it was a bright dazzling color. His eyes clear and deep eyes could directly penetrate one\u2019s heart.Crown princess? Su Luo went deep into thought and finally discovered the truth from the memory of the former owner of this body.It was actually real. Because it had been said that the original Su Luo was the reincarnation of a bird god, as a result, the empress engaged her to the crown prince. After all these years, even if her reputation was so poor that the wedding contract was so shaky that it was about to collapse, it still had not yet been officially terminatedSo Su Jingyu\u2019s lie, which framed her in front of the crown prince, first brushed away any suspicions about Su Xi and Su Wan\u2019s involvement on one hand, second, settled the difficult problem the crown prince raised, and third, naturally helped his precious sister in opening a path to her future.Because only when she, Su Luo, made way on that road, would Su Xi have the chance to become crown princess.Su Jingyu ah, Su Jingyu\u2026.

Furthermore, her position of the crown prince\u2019s fiancee was on the verge of being withdrawn.

With a wave of his sleeves, not even his shadow was left.The people in front of the Lotus Pond had already left.A gentle breeze made ripples on the water\u2019s surfaceIn the lotus pond stood a shivering Miss Su Xi.Waiting from afternoon till dusk, then from dusk to nightfall, Su Xi waited until her face become pale, lips turned purple, but her third sister still did not come to bring her clothing.Poor Su Xi did not know that when she pushed Su Wan, she used too much force and thus knocked Su Wan out into a dead faint.Su Xi in the lotus pond become so angry that she almost start stomping her feet. In her heart she started to hate Su Wan. She silently vowed that after she goes back she will not let Su Wan off.Waiting until the night became completely black, using the cover of darkness, Su Xi finally jumped out of the lotus pond and onto the ground.Suddenly, nearby a bloodcurdling scream cried : \u201cGhost!!\u201dFollowing the sound of the scream, Su Xi slowly turned her head toward the sound, her face hideously distorted, eyes crimson from anger.She had been picked on enough for today!She turned around and was about to unleash her anger at the luckless footman when she realized that the footman had already passed out after being scared silly by the \u201cghost\u201d. Now with no way to unleash her frustration, Su Xi turned her eyes away and used the cover of the darkness to quickly flee toward her courtyard.The remotest small courtyard in Su Manor.Su Luo had a sliver of grass in her mouth, with both hands behind her head, as she laid on the roof with both feet propped up, giving off a leisurely relaxed impressionShe leisurely reviewed what happened this morning. When thinking about how both Su Xi and Su Wan was embarrassed she become happy. Thinking about future fights and grievances between the two made her even happier.While thinking, suddenly an unparalleled face flashed across Su Luo\u2019s musingEspecially that pair of bewitching eyes, black as ink, with bright light shining from the obsidian iris full of pride.Although his laugh seemed to be careless, it hid the strength and majesty of an eagle; compelling, disdainful yet at the same time, gave off a strong domineering attitude.She described the guy to Lu Luo, who immediately become so excited that the bowl in her hand started to shake.She excitedly said: \u201cMistress, if my guess isn\u2019t wrong, then the one you meet is His Highness Prince Jin!

If that was true, then \u201cwinner becomes king, loser becomes queen\u201d is not something he would careless throw around. With his talent, it wouldn\u2019t be hard for him to steal the throne.While Su Luo was still engrossed in these thoughts, a magnified face suddenly appeared before her eyes.The narrow and elegant face, under the perfectly shaped eyebrows with a pair of black godlike eyes, looked like the work of a master sculptor.She recently saw this perfect face this afternoon, so she could not have mistaken this person\u2026. Unless this was an illusion?Su Luo was thinking about using her hands to rub her eyes but a large pair of hands grabbed hold of her delicate hands.

Am I right?\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s thin masculine red lips bent into a silly smile.Su Luo stared at him unblinkingly as she stressed each sentence. \u201cIt is said that Nangong Liuyun is coldly arrogant, haughty, cruel, stern, and obsessive about maintaining his personal space. If anyone touches his hand, no matter who it is, he will cut off their hand. If someone accidently bumped into him, no matter whom, he would make mincemeat out of them\u2026. Are you really that Prince Jin?\u201dSu Luo\u2019s gorgeous eyes gazed at the large hand holding her own. Her voice was crystal clear as the corners of her mouth tilted into a relaxed smile.Nangong Liuyun leisurely glanced at Su Luo with a pair of piercing eyes that glowed like the eyes of a wild wolf; frigid and searing.At the moment, he was unlike the lazy laidback person from the afternoon. Now, he seemed more serious and vigilant.At this moment, a gust of freezing wind started to surround the courtyard all the way up to the roof. This wind seemed to condense the surrounding air into ice and made it hard for people to breath.His forbidding atmosphere containing a barely suppressed killing intent, chilling bloodthirsty, and a \u201csubmit to me and prosper or oppose me and perish\u201d kind of domineering air. It seemed like if he stamped his foot, this entire Eastern Ling Empire would be shaken by a level three earthquake.Under his forceful and domineering gaze, Su Luo\u2019s gaze was as clear as water. Its surface was as calm as ice; placid, tranquil and composed.Suddenly, his mouth curved into a bemused expression and then the weather immediately changed from hazy frost to clear blue skies. The ice seem to melt into bubbling spring water full of blooming flowers.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s laugh was like the cherry blossoms in March; gentle, beautiful and intoxicating.His smooth white hands gently held her delicate jade-like hands as he smiled tenderly. \u201cGirl, what are you afraid of? It\u2019s not as if this king is going to eat you.\u201dIn this staring contest of clashing wills, no one was able to get the upper hand in this silent war.

We are even.\u201dWho knew that Nangong Liuyun would stick out his slender forefinger, and started to firmly shake it in front of Su Luo\u2019s eyes while laughing evilly. \u201cNo, it\u2019s more correct to say that you beat this king and this king beat you.\u201d After saying this he indulgently rubbed her hair.\u201cYou are purposefully being unreasonable. No one would interpret the result of the bet that way.\u201d Su Luo angrily responded.\u201cIn the beginning, you didn\u2019t say that we can\u2019t interpret the result of the bet this way.\u201d In actuality, the one being unreasonable really was Prince Jin.Su Luo tried to suppress her anger. This ruthlessly cunning fox, if he was living in modern era, how many people would be trapped by him?\u201cBe good, come here.\u201d Prince Jin beckoned with his elegant slender fingers.She wasn\u2019t a little dog! Su Luo calmly crossed her chest, as her lips began to curve up into a faint smile.As Prince Jin watched her actions, he raised his beautiful eyebrows. A pair of dark eyes like a bottomless lake fervently gazed at Su Luo.Just when Su Luo was about to frown, she suddenly felt dizzy. When she opened her eyes again, she found that she had already dropped into his arms. Her eyes lifted upwards and was caught by his pair of alluring eyes.When she meet that pair of outrageously gorgeous eyes, her heart suddenly started to skip in ba-thump ba-thumps.That pair of outrageously gorgeous eyes, was unbelievably calm and even more unspeakable intense.It was as if the gaze held in for 10,000 years.Su Luo\u2019s throat seem to be blocked; it seemed as if she couldn\u2019t say a single word.It took her a while to gather her bearings and she secretly warned herself about it in her heart.Prince Jin leaned forward. His hot breath lingered around her sensitive earlobe as his pair of cold falcon-like eyes that contained a hint of mystery, started to shine with a dazzling and beautiful light.\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d before Su Luo could finish saying \u2018what are you about to do\u2019, Su Luo felt a shadow move toward her lips. It was aggressive, fast and unstoppable.\u201cUu\u2014\u2014\u201d Her lips had been seized by a hot and soft sensation. Su Luo\u2019s could only feel her mind going blank, followed by a dizziness\u2026.In front of her eyes was a magnified face. This outrageously handsome man was uninhibitedly kissing her with his eyes closed.His strong and overbearing kiss was like an attacking thunderstorm that plundered her mouth.Su Luo tried to resist by attempting to remove his hands, but she was unable to do so. Instead, the opposite occurred. Prince Jin\u2019s steel-like grip become even tighter that she almost cried out in pain.The fervent kiss was earth-shattering, overbearing, and intense, but was at the same time, tender and gentle.Su Luo almost lost herself for a moment when she melted into his gentle, yet passionate embrace.The lack of oxygen forced her lips open as she gasped for breath. Her eyes were hazy from intoxication\u2026 When she finally recovered her mind, the light in her eyes sharpened!\u201cSlap\u2014\u2014\u201d She heavily slapped him across the face.This guy, who does he think he is, how could he forcefully kiss her like this?An angry aura that filled the air came from someplace hidden nearby. But with a casual wave of Prince Jin\u2019s hand, the outrage in the air became tranquil.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And how extraordinary was his talent? Su Manor\u2019s strongest elder was only a 5th step expert, but their master Prince Jin is only 18 years old and was already at the 6th step!From infancy till now, His Highness Prince Jin had never been so ill-treated before! Yet now, somebody actually hit him! This good-for-nothing girl without a trace of spiritual power actually dared to be so arrogant and belligerent!Nangong Liuyun stretched out his slender fingers to slowly rub the cheek that was slapped as his pair of haughty, frigid falcon-like eyes gave off a threatening air.In the hidden depths of his eyes, there was a diabolical glint that was as smooth as a mirror, unusually cold, and unfathomable when he intensely gazed at her beguilingly.Because of his stare, her heart grew fearful.A sense of panic flashed across Su Luo\u2019s heart, but quickly it calmed down. With her head held high and chest out, she meet his eyes refusing to yield.Suddenly, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s frighteningly handsome countenance changed when his mouth slowly begin to tilt up and burst open into a smile similar to a blooming Queen of the Night; flirtatious and magnificent.\u201cClap\u2014\u2014 Clap\u2014\u2014 Clap\u2014\u2014\u201d The crisp sound of applause surrounded her until Nangong Liuyun\u2019s used his pair of pretty hands to pull Su Luo into his arms with just a tug.\u201cGirl, your fierce self confidence makes it hard for people to figure out how to deal with you. Should this king applaud your courage or laugh at your stupidity?\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s pair of devilishly enchanting eyes held a hint of frustration. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that in this country, attacking a 5th step expert would get you the death penalty? You have already been sentenced to death, do you understand that?\u201dWhat the heck? She can\u2019t protest against being forcefully kissed? What kind of law is this? Why is it so biased for the strong elite?Nangong Liuyun seemed to understand her unspoken words and vaguely smiled. \u201cIn this world that respects the powerful, the fist is law. It\u2019s not fair right? But who told you to be a good-for-nothing.\u201dSu Luo clenched her fists, unwilling to let go.Nangong Liuyun gave her a harsh lesson in reality. Gave her a clear understanding that in this world, only a powerful fist would allow someone to have the right to speak.Nangong Liuyun slightly narrowed his eyes; his nefariously alluring eyes scanned Su Luo from top to bottom. Then, he stroked her hand and touched her head.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Did he think that she was a doll?Under the moonlight, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s pair of beautiful ink-black irises held a hint of mystery. He suddenly stood up, pulled on Su Luo\u2019s hands, and charmingly said. \u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019m going to take you somewhere.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d Su Luo looked at him with a perplexed expression.At this moment, his eyes shone brightly with traces of flickering excitement. It was almost like he had suddenly found an explanation to something he was puzzling over.\u201cThe Spirit Testing Temple.\u201d Nangong Liuyun swiped aside a fine silken strand of black hair from her forehead. His perfect jawline was clearly distinct while his charming voice forcefully compelled her, making it impossible to refuse.\u201cThe Spirit Testing Temple? What are we going to do there?\u201d Su Luo knew this place, because that day when she received her results from the spirit testing temple, was when her life had drastically changed.\u201cWhat do you think people do at the Spirit Testing Temple?\u201d Nangong Liuyun suddenly released the sound of a warm chuckle. His voice was friendly and relaxed; the sound was extremely beautiful, especially in the silence of the night sky.\u201cBut doesn\u2019t the Spirit Temple only allow people to enter on the first of the month?\u201dNangong Liuyun playfully chuckled a few times. While poking at her smooth forehead, he indulgently said. \u201cSilly girl, you must get used to the fact that some people, like this king, were born to receive such privileged treatment.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(1)His jet-black hair poured down his back in silken threads in an indescribably stunning way. His tall, well-defined stature was elegant, and his slender body carried such noble bearing. Dressed in loose robes that gracefully danced in the air while the jade belt around his waist fluttered along with the wind, it was as if he was floating like an immortal.His eyes filled with confidence and arrogance, as he emitted the noble and domineering air of a towering aloof god while his entire body exuded a brilliant light that dazzles the eyes.It seems as if just by standing there, he could control the entire world, with its majestic mountains and endless rivers, in the palm of his hand.\u201cWhy are you taking me there?\u201d Su Luo mumbled. She always believed that the motive behind the seemingly innocent courting behavior was used to either rob or rape. She was always wary of such behavior.\u201cDidn\u2019t you always want to go?\u201d Prince Jin sucked on his crimson lips as his charming nefarious eyes drew her in. \u201cThis king has already collected his bet, you don\u2019t want to collect yours?\u201dAt this moment, Su Luo recalled that she could still suggest a condition.So she may as well participate in this game of words, since it\u2019s not as if she was the one who put forth that condition out loud, right?\u201cLets go!\u201d Before Nangong Liuyun finished speaking, he had already hugged Su Luo to his chest. His body seem to grow wings as he rapidly flited through the air, almost as if his foot never touched the ground. He was like a dragonfly skimming the water\u2019s surface that only left a reflection.The wind rushed by her ears. Su Luo became curious and decided to open her eyes. She saw the passing scenery while flying through the air. Looking downwards, it seemed as if she could see the entire capital.\u201cNot afraid?\u201d While effortlessly carrying her in the sky, Nangong Liuyun could actually talk smoothly without gasping for breath. Evidently, the level of his martial arts was high, high enough to be at an unfathomable peak, and unfathomable enough to be bottomless.\u201cI like it.\u201d Su Luo truly enjoyed this kind of soaring across the horizon type of feeling. It was as if she could see every living thing in her vision as she looked down. She took a deep breath as her hand balled into a tight fist.Unfortunately, she was a natural good-for-nothing, doomed to be unable to achieve the same height as Nangong Liuyun.It seemed as if Nangong Liuyun could understood her silent wishful thoughts when he charmingly smiled and spoke with his enchantingly deep voice, \u201cOnce the test results are out, who says there wouldn\u2019t be a reversal in the outcome?\u201d\u201cIf only!\u201d Su Luo secretly encouraged herself in her heart.In the distance, the outline of the temple could finally be spotted.The temple was established at the very core of the imperial capital and its location was even more orderly than the imperial palace. From top to bottom, one could only see sharp pointed roofs, a wide plaza with a fountain at the center, and in front of the fountain were rows of master ranked sculpted statues.Tiger, leopard, jackal, wolf\u2026. Even the continent\u2019s magic beast sculptures could also be found here.\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d Nangong Liuyun gently floated down with Su Luo and the two directly landed in front of the temple\u2019s entrance.Nangong Liuyun didn\u2019t even need to show his title plate because the elderly gate-keeper had already respectfully saluted him before concentrating on opening the temple gates.In accordance to what Nangong Liuyun had said, his face was the best name plate.He led Su Luo into the hall on the third floor.The first floor was where commoners were assessed.The second floor was where military officials were tested.And those who could enter the third floor were extremely few, for only members of the imperial family were entitled to enter there.The third floor\u2019s lights shone with a mysteriousness feeling. It was rich and luxurious, exquisite and beautiful, with a huge jade table in the center of the wide hall. And atop of the table, was a crystal ball merely the size of a grapefruit.The crystal ball flickered with sparkling fluorescence. It was clear, translucent, and its brightness was similar to an eye\u2019s, as if it was able to reflect the deepest part of a person\u2019s heart.Innate spiritual strength was separated into seven different colors: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. Red was the weakest, and purple was the strongest. Since the beginning of the continent\u2019s history, it was so rare to possess purple colored innate talent that you could count them using your fingers and it probably only happened once every several hundred years.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If she still didn\u2019t have it, there\u2019s no reason at all for her to be disappointed.The crystal ball\u2019s radiance was similar to that of translucent spring water, and it radiance even allowed nervous people to calm down.\u201cClose your eyes and don\u2019t think of anything. Just go find the spiritual energy residing inside yourself.\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s deep voice was as gentle as the slowly flowing stream of water from a little brook, that gives her a sort of delightful feeling.Su Luo nodded her head as her expression became calm and peaceful, she entered into a different kind of unconsciousness.Behind the crystal ball were seven crystal pillars that were roughly around ten meters tall and as clear as water located in a lake where the bottom can be seen.At the moment, they were devoid of any colorful pigments but if someone\u2019s innate spiritual strength was high enough, these crystal pillars would begin to change color starting from the first.The colors on the seven crystal pillars were separated into red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue and purple. Only when the first red colored pillar was completely filled would the second orange color begin to show.At the moment, Su Luo felt her spiritual energy flowing out of her palm like the rushing tides.The crystal ball began to glow and even became more and more radiant, more and more dazzling, and was so bright that it almost pained one\u2019s eyes.Nangong Liuyun simply stood by Su Luo and his eyes froze for only a moment\u2014\u2014Suddenly\u2014\u2014A blazing red ray of light hit the first crystal pillar.In less than a second\u2019s worth of time, the first crystal pillar whooshed and was already filled with red colored spiritual energy.The second pillar also whooshed, and was completely filled.Nangong Liuyun was originally standing in a relaxed position with his arms across his chest while wearing a mysterious smile but now, his posture somewhat faltered as he became stunned at the unceasingly brilliant colored pillars!Wasn\u2019t this speed a bit too fast!?Based on Nangong Liuyun\u2019s former knowledge, even if your innate talent was extremely good, this crystal pillar will still continue to be filled at the speed of a little brook, slow and unhurried. He had never before seen the immediate whooshing he was seeing now that was like a rocket\u2019s lift off into space.Red\u2026..Orange\u2026..Yellow\u2026..Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh. In less than a minute, Su Luo had already passed through three crystal pillars. Furthermore, judging by her face that wasn\u2019t red from panting for breath, she had not even reached her limit.Nangong Liuyun stood still and stared at the girl in the midst of the dazzling aurora of brilliant light as his eyes revealed a hint of odd fascination.Currently, her body was enveloped by a layer of pure brilliance. Her long, jet-black hair glittered with a glossy luster and seemed as if it would break the delicate skin that resembled beautiful porcelain chinaware.She calmly stood there for a long time, wearing a content smile as she radiated brilliant rays of light like spring morning\u2019s dew, refreshing and moving. She was so enchanting that it seem as if she stole a person\u2019s soul thus holding their gaze in enthrilledSu Luo was completely unaware of Nangong Liuyun\u2019s thoughts, and was also completely unaware of the fact that her innate talent had flabbergasted Nangong Liuyun to such an extreme extent. At this time, she was still unceasingly releasing her spiritual energy.Green\u2026 The green colored crystal pillar had also become completely full.It was as if the spiritual energy could not be stopped, for it quickly climbed up to the cyan pillar!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Because even on this continent, very few were able to reach blue ranked innate spiritual strength.However\u2026.. What left Nangong Liuyun completely speechless was that her spiritual energy acted like a naughty child. It climbed slowly but surely while trying to reach the summit and actually\u2014\u2014Actually lit up that crystal pillar.The purple colored crystal pillar\u2014\u2014 In the history of the Eastern Ling Empire the number of people who lit up that color could be counted on one hand, but this girl Su Luo, actually reached purple colored spiritual energy!Yet this kind of girl had been treated as a good-for-nothing for the past decade; bullied, abused, and neglected. It was simply a tragic waste of talent!At this moment, if not for Nangong Liuyun\u2019s noble upbringing, even he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold back the curse words.What happened years ago? Why did such a talented girl get labeled as a good-for-nothing? This matter must be thoroughly investigated. A freezing cold expression flashed across Nangong Liuyun\u2019s eyes.Ten minutes, thirty minutes, and one hour later\u2026. The spiritual energy she sent into the crystal ball was like the endless sea. Even after so long, her expression showed no trace of fatigue.In this world that only respected the strong, talent and innate spiritual strength determined everything\u2026 Each of these seven colors represented a person\u2019s future levels of success.Purple was subdivided into high class, middle class and low class.Overtime, the purple spiritual energy slowly rose pass low class to reach middle class, and finally reaching\u2026.High class!High class purple!Nangong Liuyun\u2019s normally serene and unflappable face, now carried a dumbfounded expression.Originally he thought that Su Luo reaching blue colored spiritual energy was not bad, but in the end, she reached purple colored high class. It was too inconceivable and that innate talent was so strong to the point of being frightening.However\u2026. However, that purple colored spiritual energy was still slowly rising and continuing its freakish climb. Its silent climbing speed wouldn\u2019t overtake an ant, but he had never heard of this happening in reality.It was getting close, getting closer to the summit\u2026.However, at this moment, the situation suddenly changed!Just when the crystal ball was about to be completely filled, the seven colored crystal pillars suddenly became black, as if they had crashed, and all the colors dissipated.At this moment, the seven crystal pillars returned to their original transparently clear color, and not a hint of color was left to be seen.Su Luo suddenly felt a metallic sweet taste in her throat as a stream of blood burst from the corner of her mouth\u2014\u2014\u201cLuo Luo!\u201d Nangong Liuyun seemed like he teleported in front of Su Luo, his speed was as fast as dispersed smoke. He held Su Luo in his bosom, with an anxious and panicked expression.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Su Luo leaned into his embrace and weakly shook her head. \u201cWhat happened earlier? What exactly was the result of the test? Is it still the same good-for-nothing result?\u201dAfter all, she was still concerned about her good-for-nothing innate talent.A crooked smile perked from the corner of Nangong Liuyun mouth. He playfully tapped her smooth forehead and answered with his low voice. \u201cIf you are a good-for-nothing then everyone under the heavens are idiots.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026. I\u2019m not a good-for-nothing?\u201d Su Luo\u2019s mood suddenly became less tense as her electrified gaze looked expectantly toward Nangong Liuyun.\u201cCough, cough.\u201d At the moment, Nangong Liuyun didn\u2019t know how to break the news to Su Luo. \u201cAh, actually, there might be a little problem with this crystal ball\u2026.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His mouth held a hint of tenderness that even he didn\u2019t realize: \u201cSilly girl, don\u2019t you know that the green color represents the wood element while orange color denotes the fire element?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying?\u201d\u201cCorrect, you have two elemental attributes and they are wood and fire.\u201d A touch of envy appeared in Nangong Liuyun\u2019s eyes.\u201d A lot of people worship the dual elemental combination of earth and fire.\u201d\u201cWhat are you so jealous of?\u201d Su Luo asked, perplexed. She already heard from Lu Luo before that the legendary Prince Jin is a tri-elemental practitioner, then why would he envy her dual elements?\u201cGirl, you really don\u2019t know how blessed you are.\u201d Nangong Liuyun considerately helped her off the floor and resettled her onto a cushioned lounge to the side. To clear up her confusion he started to explain. \u201cIf it were any other elements, even having two is nothing special, but the appearance of both wood and fire elements in the same person, do you know what this means?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Su Luo blankly stared him. She really knew next to nothing about this world that respected the powerful.\u201cWhen the wood and fire element appear together, it heralds the emergence of Apothecary talent. Girl, do you know about Apothecaries? Her lost expression look so adorable that he furtively stroked her little pink cheeks.Su Luo glared at him and indifferently said: \u201c Please explain.\u201dNangong Liuyun laughed heartily: \u201cPeople with multiple elements are already rare, but the condition of having dual wood and fire elements to become an Apothecarist is even more scarce. Thus, Apothecaries are rare existences in this world with extremely exalted status. Take you as an example, if your father knew about your talent he would utilize everything to support you. Let alone have the courage to bully you, people would even be afraid to criticize you.\u201d\u201cApothecaries are that useful?\u201d Su Luo tilted her delicate face and carefully asked.Of course, ever heard of the Limit Breaking Immortal Pill? With just one pill, one would be able to breakthrough the bottleneck to reach the next level. Now do you still think Apothecaries are useless?\u201d Nangong Liuyun gently rubbed her head.\u201d Now do you understand how awe-inspiring your talent is? Does your heart feel a little better now?\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Su Luo looked at hands, then glanced at the clear transparent crystal ball.

However, she did not mention this matter to Nangong Liuyun.After returning to the Manor, Su Luo laid on her bed and thought about today\u2019s events.The scheme that made Su Wan fall in the water, which also dragged in Su Xi, made the two sisters fight with one another, and made them suffer tremendously.As she drifted into thought, a handsome face suddenly popped up in her mind for no reason at all.An incomparably handsome appearance, extremely high innate talent, extremely strong martial arts, and was even the empire\u2019s respected prince. He didn\u2019t treat her that badly, and figuratively speaking, Nangong Liuyun wouldn\u2019t be that bad of a partner.The corner of Su Luo\u2019s mouth unfolded into a faint and bitter smile.So what if Nangong Liuyun was serious about her? Her heart had been broken long ago, and was nearly destroyed. How could she fall in love with another once more?Yun Qi, how are you doing in that world? I had swallowed the Dragon Ring so you would never be able to find it, heh. Would Sister Ming forgive you?Without warning, a sparkling teardrop tumbled down her fair delicate face and moistened her cotton pillow.Yun Qi had given her an unprecedented blow and ruthlessly smashed her faithful devotion into pieces. Su Luo knew that if she fell in love with another in this lifetime and trust another in that way again, that would be a truly difficult feat.Nighttime. It seemed as if the sky had been wrapped by black armband. As for the time before daybreak, the night sky was at its most darkest of black, as if thick black ink had been spilled on it.The Su Luo who had sunk into deep sleep did not know the speed of how this day arrived so fast.Early morning, the first appearance of the red sun unhurriedly climbed upwards in the distant eastern sky. As daylight surfaced, the whole sky was tinged in red hues, evidently prophesizing a clear and bright day. However, many felt that today, was Su Luo\u2019s most disastrous day.After having breakfast, Lu Luo suddenly rushed over in an urgent manner, with tears in her eyes and a face full of panic.\u201cMiss, how could you still be so calm and relaxed? Something major has occurred!\u201d Due to her rushing here as quick as possible, she gasped for breath.Su Luo poured a cup of water for her and faintly smiled. \u201cDifferent situations call for different actions, take your time. Slowly drink this water and then talk.\u201dHow could Lu Luo possibly have time to drink water? She was so anxious that her forehead was littered with beads of sweat. In a panic, she said: \u201cMiss, how could this be a good thing? At dawn, the crown prince personally brought men here and said that he wanted to annul your engagement!\u201dOh? So it\u2019s like that? And she thought something bad had happened. Su Luo calmly poured water for herself and unhurried drank it as if she was currently sampling the world\u2019s most valuable tea.Seeing her calm and collected expression, Lu Luo became angrier, \u201cMiss! Hurry up and think of a way. You were originally engaged to the crown prince yet was still bullied to that state. If this engagement was annulled, what would the future hold for you\u2026\u201dLu Luo still did not know that her former cowardly owner had already been switched with a more stronger soul and was so worried that she was about to start crying.Su Luo smiled at her and secretly spoke to herself. This marriage thing would sooner or later be annulled. If the crown prince doesn\u2019t come in to annul the engagement, she would personally go to annul it later on. The crown prince wanting to annul the engagement fits well with her plan, so why would she go out to prevent it?At this moment, chaotic footsteps came from outside the door. A middle aged woman came in, looked down at Su Luo with a disgusted glance, and coldly said: \u201cFourth Miss, Madam requests that you go to the main hall. She wants to discuss an important matter with you.\u201dThis woman was Madam\u2019s most efficient nanny. Known as Nanny Gui, she was at the second step of the Warrior so she was always aloof even in front of Su Luo. Just by facial indications alone, it was as if she was the master and Su Luo was the inferior one.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The original soul that inhibited Su Luo\u2019s body suffered countless losses at the hands of Madam Su and and Nanny Gui.Nanny Gui coldly smiled and scornfully said. \u201c Fourth miss, you\u2019re joking right?\u201d\u201cThis Miss never jokes.\u201d Su Luo replied seemingly crossed her arms over her chest and seemed serious replied.Nanny Gui narrowed her eyes and a vicious light flashed across her eyes. \u201cSince Fourth Miss does not appreciate my kindness, then this servant will no longer be polite.\u201dAlthough she said she was the servant, there was no trace of respect in her expression and her actions were even more ruthlessly disrespectful. She casually took a few steps forward and appeared by Su Luo\u2019s side. Her strong hands, like those used to catch baby chickens, extended toward Su Luo\u2019s throat.Su Luo\u2019s eyes contained a frigid light.Even a servant dare to hit her? Looks like Nanny Gui is impatient to die.Right at this time of imminent peril, when the burly hands were about to seize Su Luo as Nanny Gui\u2019s eyes flashed with victory, the situation suddenly reversed!\u201cAHHHH\u2014\u2014\u201d A miserable scream broke from Nanny Gui\u2019s mouth and she looked as if her right arm was in pain as she covered it. The pain was so fierce that cold sweat started dripping off Nanny Gui\u2019s face.Of course Nanny Gui was in extreme pain. Since Su Luo was knowledgeable about human anatomy, when she fought, she directly hit the critical points on Nanny Gui\u2019s right arm. Her movements were clean and neat without a hint of sloppyness.Su Luo crossed her arms across her chest and calmly looked at her with a taunting, cold smile on her face.\u201cH-how do you know\u2026. this isn\u2019t possible!\u201d Nanny Gui looked astonished and was obviously aghast.\u201cOh?\u201d Su Luo faintly sneered.Nanny Gui painfully took a deep breath. She secretly cried to herself; illusion, it must be an illusion. Forth Miss is a good-for-nothing who doesn\u2019t know any martial arts. How could she possibly beat me?Thinking up to here, Nanny Gui released a evil laugh. \u201cSince Fourth Miss refused my polite request unless I force you to, then don\u2019t blame this old servant for being impolite!\u201dNanny Gui used her other hand, curved into a steel claw, and reached toward Su Luo\u2019s neck. She didn\u2019t believe that she could not grasp the weak Fourth Miss, who did not know martial arts, with this method.Suddenly, a black shadow flashed across Nanny Gui\u2019s eyes. Su Luo\u2019s figure had already disappeared from her line of sight.However, in that short time, Su Luo aimed her foot at Nanny Gui\u2019s butt and kicked.It was this exact Buddha Mountain Shadowless Kick, that kicked Su Wan into the lotus pond yesterday. This kick was even more powerful now; it directly sent Nanny Gui into the wall three meters away.Afterwards, a loud violent crash resounded.The wall had not been repaired for many years now. Thus, it wasn\u2019t very solid. The wall shook violently a few times and did not collapse, but some powdered mud broke from the wall and dropped to the ground. At this time, Nanny Gui had already passed out from hitting the wall.Su Luo\u2019s display of power stunned Lu Luo so much that her jaw dropped to the floor.\u201cM-M-Miss?\u201d Lu Luo was so surprised that she could not speak in complete sentences.Looking at the Miss who, with one kick, sent Nanny Gui into a dead faint, Lu Luo firmly rubbed her eyes. She still could not believe her eyes.\u201cOh.\u201d Su Luo softly sighed. With one hand under her chin, she pondered over how she was going to deal with this old witch.From Su Luo\u2019s previous memories, she recalled that these past years, Nanny Gui continuously bullied her. Even worse, she deliberately asked the kitchen to send pig feed for her to eat! When she was sick, instead of giving her medicine, she replaced the medicine with urine! The original Su Luo angrily protested but Nanny Gui actually used large needles to poke her!This kind of old witch, it\u2019s best she dies!Just based on that hit, she should be out cold for a few days.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her face brimmed with joy.She was wearing a wide crimson sleeved flowing fairy top with a loose grass green pleated skirt decorated with misty flowers. Wrapped around her waist was a golden silk belt that blinds the eyes. She was like a freshly blooming lotus; youthfully delicate, lovable and charming.Everything was beautiful except for one small glaring mistake; there were too many gold and silver jewelries on her body. It seemed as if she was wearing all the beautiful jewelry from the jewelry box; it was flamboyant, vulgar and tacky.Today was the day Su Xi looked forward to for a long time.Early in the morning, she was excitedly sitting in the main hall, shifted from left to right, but Su Luo still had not arrived. She finally couldn\u2019t wait any longer and personally went looking for Su Luo.She was just about to ridicule Su Luo, when she saw Nanny Gui laying on the floor, uncertain if she was dead or alive. An alarmed feeling flashed through her heart; her wide eyes glared at Su Luo and angrily said. \u201cNanny Gui kindly come to invite you, what exactly did you do to her?\u201dSu Luo innocently spread her hands. \u201c I didn\u2019t touch her at all.\u201d But I did kick her with my feet.Su Xi didn\u2019t hear the deception in Su Luo\u2019s words. She wrinkled her eyebrows in displeasure.\u201cThen how could she have ended up this way without reason?\u201d Su Xi angrily asked.In her eyes, her mom\u2019s right hand Nanny Gui was obviously more important than this Fourth Elder Sister Su Luo.Su Luo\u2019s innocent face, containing an expression of \u2018you ask me who am I to ask\u2019, gently moved her lips. She thought about it and hesitantly said. \u201cJust when Nanny Gui was walking she accidentally hit the wall. After that, she fainted. It was really weird.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible! Fourth sister, when you lie, don\u2019t you even write a rough draft?\u201d Su Xi sneered again as her shady eyes stared at Su Luo.Su Luo helplessly replied: \u201cWho really knows? Even if you don\u2019t believe me, there is nothing I can do. But recently a lot of unlucky things happening in the manor is real. This morning, I heard the servants outside saying that a ghost came out of the lotus pond. They say that the ghost, looks ferocious, with a wide bloody mouth\u2026.\u201dLotus pond being haunted\u2026. These words stabbed at Su Xi\u2019s heart. Because if it was really haunted, than that ghost was her, Su Xi.\u201cShut up!\u201d As Su Xi thought about yesterday\u2019s embarrassment, her face start to color with anger. She quickly change the subject. \u201cOkay, since Nanny Gui wants to faint, then let her faint. Quickly. ome with me to the main hall to greet the crown prince.\u201dSu Xi did consider the possibility that Su Luo did the deed, but not even a single trace of battle was in the room. Also Su Luo was a good-for-nothing, how can she possibly be a match for Nanny Gui, who was a second step Warrior? So she directly ruled out the possibility that Su Luo was the attacker.SInce it couldn\u2019t be explained clearly, then she\u2019ll just ignore it and drop it.Su Xi allowed no explanation and dragged Su Luo out with her. She was afraid that Su Luo would run away if she let go. If that happened, then the person who would suffer a loss would be her, Su Xi.Because breaking off this engagement required Su Luo to be physically present; it required her to hear the imperial decree with her own ears to complete the ceremony.Su Luo coldly turned her head and glanced at Nanny Gui.She originally worked hard for Su Xi, but in the end, didn\u2019t she just get casually discarded? She wondered how Nanny Gui would feel after waking up and finding out about how Su Xi easily abandoning her.Su Manor Main Hall.The main hall was extremely large. The floor was covered in red carpet. There were two rows of eight seats on each side, each was made from the precious Purple Fir Wood and gave off a natural gorgeous, luxurious and expensive air.The reason why the Purple Fir Wood was expensive, was because it only grew in the Dark Forest, where many magical beasts roamed. Thus, the transportation cost for the wood was prohibitively expensive.Only similarly powerful and wealth families like the Su Manor could extravagantly afford to make furniture out of the wood.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Today he was dressed in a yellow brocade robe, patterned with six golden dragons that ferociously bared their fangs and brandished their claws.The crown prince was wearing a flat rectangular crown with nine tassels. Each tassel was composed of a golden string threaded through with small silver pearls. The light from the tasseled crown revealed a wild, frivolous and tyrannical face.His lips were puckered as if sucking on something sour, and his nose was hooked like an eagle\u2019s beak. His seemingly calm gaze hid a sharp eagle like deadly edge.From the beginning, his pair of matchless indifferent eyes never glanced at Su Luo. It was as if just glancing at Su Luo, would dirty his honorable eyes.Holding a cup of fragrant tea, his posture was elegant and noble. Perfectly composed, he coolly sipped the fragrant tea with a lofty attitude and indifferent demeanor.Sitting beside him at a lower seating was Great General Su, Su Zian.This was the first time Su Luo saw the father of her body\u2019s original owner.She only saw a forty year or so person covered in an ink colored robe who had a cold and frigid expression. This person gave off a piercing imposing and detached aura; especially his stern eyes that contained an endless harsh chilliness.He turned his severe imposing face and shouted at Su Luo. \u201cHow can you be so lacking in manners? Why aren\u2019t you saluting the crown prince?\u201dAt this time, Su Xi had already sweetly given the proper ceremonial salute to the crown prince. She had already intimately walked to the crown prince\u2019s side, affectionately and sweetly saying crown prince brother this and crown prince that.The crown prince lifted his eyes, a dismissing glance landed on Su Luo\u2019s face. He indifferently asked. \u201c You are Su Luo?\u201dTo be honest, the girl standing in front of him didn\u2019t look too bad.Clothed in a white butterfly muslin gown that swept the floor, which showed off her shapely figure; ink black hair tied with a light purple ribbon, and a few strands of escaped hair playfully draped across her shoulder. Her face devote of cosmetics, was so fresh that it was even moving.Su Luo softly replied. \u201c Yes.\u201d Her clear voice was calm and collected, cold and agile, with not a single superfluous word.She bravely held the crown prince\u2019s gaze with her dark iris that looked like dotted ink.The crown prince slightly frowned, because Su Luo\u2019s eyes were too pure and too bright. The gaze that was as pure as water, seemed to be like a blinding light that could instantly see through all the secrets hidden in his heart.The crown prince sulked, silently taking her measure, and tightly wrinkled his forehead. As his hands held the teacup, his mouth hooked up into a nefarious sneer. \u201cBecause of you, this king has been ridiculed for more than ten years. Tell me, what sort of punishment do you deserve?\u201dShe never thought that this crown prince would be so unscrupulous and shameless. He was ridiculed by others for more than ten years, but what did that have to do with her? He even threw all the blame onto her.If it was the past weak and powerless Su Luo, then this matter would have been dropped. But would the current Su Luo suffer such a loss? Obviously not.Su Luo coldly smiled. \u201cThen may I ask the crown prince, back then was it Su Manor who pushed for this engagement?\u201dObviously it was your dear Queen mother who saw Su Manor\u2019s Fourth Miss\u2019s good omen and hastily decided on the engagement. For fear that Su Luo would be stolen by others. If you want to find a culprit to blame than you should go look for the Queen, why are you looking for me?This is like picking up soft persimmons and nitpicking it for being soft. Did he really believe that she would not rebel?\u201cSu Luo!\u201d The color on Su Zian\u2019s face begin to change as he violently shouted.What\u2019s wrong with this girl? She didn\u2019t have such courage before and every time she saw the crown prince, she would be submissive and could barely breath. Now she even dared to talk back to the crown prince? Who give her this right?The crown prince\u2019s mouth curved into a cold smile as a pair of beautiful piercing eyes held a deep iciness and austerity. \u201cShrewish sharp mouth, a crafty and skillfully argued speech, and every word spoken is vulgar and rude.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How could this subject even compare?\u201dThe crown prince\u2019s brow wrinkled slightly as his eyes filled with annoyance and another bone chilling coldness.He carelessly played with the thumb ring on his finger, and shot a smile that was not quite a smile at Su Zian, and said. \u201c The Great General really did educate a such great daughter. She really knows how to praise this king, this king really admires that.\u201dAlthough his words sounded like praise, those words were like a sharp sword that brutally stabbed toward Great General Su\u2019s chest.Su Zian\u2019s complexion changed as he waved his hands toward Su Luo and angrily thundered. \u201cWhy are you not quickly apologizing to the crown prince?\u201dSu Luo revealed a terrified expression, and at the same time, looked despondent. She glanced at the raised hand, raised her small palm sized face, innocently asked. \u201cFather, is daughter\u2019s praise of the crown prince wrong? Is the crown prince not wise with amazing martial arts? Not eloquent in speech? Not distinguished and carefree? Are you implying that the crown prince picks on others, bully the weak, and oppress the people?\u201dSu Zian\u2019s face darkened a little bit after each sentence Su Luo uttered, until the very end when his face could be described as being covered by a dense black cloud.It could be said that every word Su Luo used, if alone, was correct but put together, it had the opposite meaning. This was Su Luo playing words games. How could Su Zian, a military man, win against her, who was an experienced veteran?At this time, Su Luo snorted in her heart. Break off the engagement? Even though this lady also wants to break off the engagement, this lady is still in a bad mood because you were the one who mentioned it.You wanted to break this engagement, but do you think it\u2019ll just break like that because you want it to break?\u201cClap.. Clap.. Clap..\u201d The crown prince suddenly stood up, and steadily, step by step, slowly walked to Su Luo\u2019s side. His condescending manner, eyes full of nefarious light, looked at her up and down.While carrying a evil and callous atmosphere, a touch of interest suddenly flashed in his gaze. Outside of his expectations, Su Luo indifferently stared back at him.But Su Luo\u2019s heart secretly become more alert. This crown prince was suspicious and capricious; if she mishandled him, then she will suffer a loss.\u201cHahaha, amusing. This is really interesting.\u201d The crown prince suddenly started to laugh loudly. He turned toward Su Zian and said. \u201c Great General Su, this king did not speak wrongly. You really did raise an interesting daughter.\u201dWhat could Su Zian possibly say? He could only laugh along with the crown prince. In the end, whatever the crown prince says, would always be right.Su Xi and Su Jingyu\u2019s expression changed in an instant.What does the crown prince mean? He praised Su Luo as amusing and looked at her with interest. Could it be that this engagement won\u2019t be cancelled?Although Su Luo\u2019s heart was secretly on guard, she was still confident about her judgement. Regarding the crown prince\u2019s feminine and viscous type of person, he was only interested in what benefit him. He would never give up Su Xi, a piece of fat meat that was about to reach his mouth, on account of Su Luo.At this moment, Su Jingyu took a step forward. His tone was a bit gloomy as he said. \u201cYour highness, the crown prince\u2014\u2014\u201dThe crown prince waved his hands, revealing that faint half smile, and that flirtatious threatening, yet matchless handsome countenance. \u201cThis king understand your meaning. Rest assured, today this engagement will be canceled, but\u2014\u2014\u201dHe condescendingly said to Su Luo. \u201c You must really want to marry this king, right? This king is not that unreasonable. I can give you a chance right now.\u201dSu Luo coldly throw him a glance as she secretly laughed in her heart.The crown prince nobley sat down on the luxurious soft cushion, and arrogantly continued. \u201cIf you can answer the question asked by this king, this king promises you, to give you the position of concubine.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It can not be awarded to just anyone, and your subject\u2019s daughter is afraid that she can\u2019t assume the responsibilities.\u201d\u201cWhat an audacious woman!\u201d Before the crown prince could speak, the imperial bodyguards at the crown prince\u2019s side, had already furiously shouted as the tip of their long swords pointed straight at Su Luo\u2019s vital point, the throat. As long as the crown prince give the order, the sword point would, without difficulty, pierce her throat.Su Luo\u2019s back was perfectly straight. Her eyes remained cool as she calmly stared at the crown prince, and tauntingly said: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? In the presence of so many people, is our wise, good at martial arts, clever and farsighted crown prince trying to intimidate his subject\u2019s daughter? Easy to say but not good to hear.\u201dThe crown prince was humiliated into anger. He coldly snorted: \u201cIntimidate my subject\u2019s daughter? You\u2019d need to be worthy of it first! Since you failed to appreciate my kindness, why should this one give you face?\u2019That said, the crown prince coldly waved his hand, and issued an order.Very quickly, a palace eunuch walked forth while holding an imperial edict in his hands, and loudly started to read: \u201cFrom heaven\u2019s mandate, the Emperor\u2019s imperial order says\u2026 The Fourth Miss of Su family behaves improperly\u2026 and was not brought up virtuously\u2026 Thus, it is impossible for her to assume the position of the crown princess. This thereby invalidates the engagement set years ago. Henceforth, there is no mutual responsibility for them to participate in this wedding, please rise\u2014\u2014\u201dAn imperial decree, was even more difficult to alter.At this time, it was rare that both Su Luo and Su Xi breathed a sigh of relief at the same time.The crown prince coldly glared at Su Luo, leaned near her ear, clenched his teeth, and said in a low voice: \u201cGirl, in the future, do not appear in front of this king!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Su Luo seems to be shocked and scared silly enough to repeat: \u201cYour highness the crown prince, your reason for breaking off the engagement, it\u2019s because, it won\u2019t\u2026 won\u2019t raise up?\u201dOnce the words left Su Luo\u2019s mouth, a deafening silence instantly surrounded the air. Everyone quickly stopped breathing, casted their eyes down, and did not dare to look at the crown prince.But the corner of her eyes and the tip of her eyebrow, were unable to conceal her smiling expression that clearly explained everything implied within those words.What a great clever and eloquent loathsome girl!!! The crown prince\u2019s face looked as if it had been whipped and was terrifying as dark clouds; it was as if a storm was imminent.This really was nothing more than Su Luo\u2019s scheme to slander. It was the so-called open conspiracy. As the name implied, it was to openly, without tricks, arrange a conspiracy.If the crown prince was to punish her, it would clearly show that he was trying to cover it up and thus, make it more conspicuous. Was it really because he lacked the confidence and stamina?But if the crown prince did not punish her, he would lose face.No matter what the crown prince did, he did not have any ground to stand on. No matter how he answered, he would not be able to clear up this misunderstanding.It\u2019s like yellow mud dropping from inside his pants from the crotch area. Even if it was not poop, it was still considered to be poop.The crown prince\u2019s face went from blue to red. He fiercely stared down at Su Luo, until finally, he harshly flinged his sleeves and strode away.Su Jingyu admonished Su Luo with displeasure: \u201cTerrible girl, how could you speak like that? How can you speak to the crown prince like that? The crown prince did not punish you because of him being merciful, you should reflect on it!\u2019After he finished speaking, Su Jingyu pacified Su Xi with a glance, then quickly followed the departing crown prince.As for what exactly he was trying to pacify, perhaps only he knew.\u201cHow\u2026 How could you\u2026 \u201d Su Zian unwaveringly glared at Su Luo. He stared at her like he wanted to swallow her whole, \u201cHow could you be this shameless!\u201dSu Luo sneered in her heart. On the surface, her lips were flat, as if she had been wronged, \u201cBut\u2026 But honorable father, the crown prince he, he really said that\u2026 \u201dWhen the crown prince leaned close to her ear and said something earlier, only the two of them knew what had been said.

What was the point of deliberately putting on an air of the dignified patriarch now? Was he really taking her for a fool?Pretending to have been wronged, Su Luo looked at Su Zian. \u201cFather, is it because I don\u2019t know propriety that the crown prince doesn\u2019t want me?

He heavily flung his sleeves as his expression became angry due to shame. \u201cIf you worked harder, how could you have ended up in this position? Who can you blame?What was wrong with this daughter today? The words she said were as cowardly as usual, but these words could actually make him choke.\u201cWhat if my innate spiritual talent now reaches the purple rank? Will father value me then?

Not to mention purple rank, just a blue rank, no, even cyan. If you really have cyan talent then I, your father will personally kneel down before you and pour water for your tea!\u201dSpeaking of Su Luo\u2019s spiritual talent, it was the most humiliating topic for Su Zian.At that time, because of this good-for-nothing Su Luo, he was mocked by his colleagues for half a year. This matter became his nightmare; even now, when this affair gets mentioned, he couldn\u2019t help but feel deep hatred.Su Luo raised her palm sized small face that looked lovely and pitiful, and weakly asked. \u201cBut father, if I accidently become a wood and fire dual elementalist, and also incidentally become an Apothecary, would you treat me very well?\u201d\u201cWood and fire dual element?\u201d Su Zian stared at Su Luo as if observing an idiot. He did not have the heart to laugh at this stupid daughter of his.But she was still quite pitiful to be born a natural good-for-nothing.He could only reply, \u201cWood and fire dual element? Luo Luo, ah. You really want to become so strong that you became crazy just from thinking about it, right? Do you even know how rare it is for a wood and fire dual element to appear? The reason why our Su family can achieve such a position we have now, could be because of your grandfather\u2019s Sea Stabilizing Divine Needle, but the most important reason, was because our Su family had a wood and fire dual element Apothecary. Do you understand? Also, about becoming an Apothecary, stop indulging in your wild fantasies!\u201dAlthough the Apothecary in the Su family was still only an Intermediate Apothecary, he was still someone that various powerful families were trying, with utmost effort, to win over. The reason why the royal family wanted to woo the Su family was mostly because of the Su family\u2019s Apothecary.This Apothecary was none other than Su Zian\u2019s biological older brother.He was infatuated with refining medicine all year round, and worked hard for a few decades, only to finally ascend to become an intermediate Apothecary.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Su Luo\u2019s vision fell upon the center of her fair hands. The results of the assessment told her that the talent within these hands were no less inferior than anyone else\u2019s. Not only that, it was actually the talent of a genius among geniuses, a kind that rarely appears once every few hundred years.Even though\u2026. a slight problem had appeared at the moment. But she would definitely find the reason.Her innate talent must not be left buried. She wanted to stand on top of the world and let those people who trampled over her regret raising their head to look down at her.Seeing the dazed Su Luo, another fit of anger emerged inside Su Zian\u2019s heart.This disappointment of a daughter, I seriously suffocate from anger every time I look at her.\u201cThere is nothing more for you here, leave quickly.\u201d This father impatiently waved his hands, like he was chasing off a beggar, and dismissed Su Luo.\u201cOh.\u201d Su Luo walked a few steps, then stopped to turn around and stare deeply at her father. Suddenly, a smile manifested on her face, a smile like the sweet and alluring Queen of the Night that was dazzling to the eye. \u201cHonorable father, today you told me to leave, but you must not regret it afterwards.\u201d\u201cHumph. Father indeed has regrets; Father\u2019s deepest regret was that he allowed you, a shameful good-for-nothing, to be born back then.\u201d Su Zian did not speak and it was actually Su Xi who answered. She taunted her by sneering with her lips as she arrogantly raised her chin.Su Xi sneered with a towering arrogance as she observed Su Luo. Her arrogant expression looked as if she had been observing a little ant. \u201cSu Luo, it is important to know one\u2019s own limits. Since you are the lowest of all losers, then scram and go back to your lowly livelihood that\u2019s no different than a dog\u2019s. Hurry up and scram! Just seeing you makes me angry!\u201dWithout the crown prince present, Su Xi\u2019s gentle ladylike manners completely disappeared as she exposed her spoiled and unreasonable true nature.Even though Su Xi hurled abusive words at Su Luo and said that she was a dog, Su Zian did not refute a single word. This was sufficient to illustrate where Su Luo\u2019s existence in this family placed in his heart.Su Luo did not bother to trade insults with Su Xi. She only took a deep glance at Su Zian. The deep meaning in her eyes fixed onto Su Zian until his heart grew nervous.Just when Su Zian was about to speak, Su Luo immediately turned around without hesitation. With big strides, she left this coldly indifferent and suffocating place.While walking, she secretly laughed grimly in her heart. Su Zian, since you chose this today, don\u2019t even think about borrowing my, Su Luo\u2019s light in the future.Su Zian was completely unaware of what he had lost after his previous cold apathy towards Su Luo.If he knew that he would be losing a purple ranked innate spiritual strength genius of a daughter, a wood and fire dual elemental Apothecary, perhaps he would regret it until his intestines became greenish black.Sadly, the world did not have medicine for regret. He used cold detachment and neglect to make this bitter fruit and he could only personally swallow it himself.In the company of Lu Luo, Su Luo slowly walked out of the Main Hall.At this time, the sun outside was at its strongest, glaring and dazzling to the eye.Su Luo\u2019s face carried a bland smile. The engagement had finally been cancelled. She could also finally release a breath of relief. As for the crown prince\u2019s hatred toward her\u2026 Presumably, the crown prince would be very busy, so he should not have time to look for her.Suddenly, Lu Luo\u2019s eyes lit up as she pointed at the side of an underbrush where a dazzling jade pendant laid. \u201cMiss, there\u2019s a purple fish jade pendant over there.\u201dLu Luo picked it up and handed it to Su Luo.Su luo looked at the purple fish jade pendent and felt that it was somewhat familiar. Suddenly, an epiphany flashed within her mind as a sly and narrow smile slowly appeared. Her eyes shined with starlight, and the corner of her mouth also curled into a mysterious smile.\u201cMiss?\u201d Lu Luo did not understand. While staring at the purple fish jade pendent, why was her Mistress smiling so treacherously?\u201cGood Lu Luo, I really must thank you!\u201d Su Luo gave her enormous praise.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A few remaining stars hung in the desolate sky as they produced a weak radiance.Suddenly, a black shadow appeared through the night sky and approached like the wind. His robe elegantly fluttered, like a beautiful fallen immortal.In a short time, this human shadow quietly landed in the remotest courtyard of the Su Manor.\u201cCome in.\u201d Very quickly, an unsurprised clear and cold voice came from the room.When Nangong Liuyun entered, he saw Su Luo with a book in hand. She was earnestly reading in the candlelight.Today she wore a white muslin gown; it was simple and plain. It seemed as if she was pure and impervious, but also outstandingly sharp.The hazy candlelight shrouded her body, as if it was covered in a faint layer of radiant mist. She looked blurred, cold and pure as well as noble and faint.Due to her killer instinct, even before the door was pushed open by Nangong Liuyun, Su Luo had already detected his presence.While Nangong Liuyun, step by step, walked toward her back, it seemed as if Su Luo\u2019s had eyes behind her back. She calmly put down the book in her hand and gestured. \u201c Sit.\u201dThe corner of Nangong Liuyun\u2019s mouth curled into a devilish enchanting smile. If he sat after being told to sit, wouldn\u2019t he be losing face?Thus, Nangong Liuyun refused to sit down on the perfectly good chair. Instead, he chose to sit on the tiny space by Su Luo\u2019s side, and closely squeeze in next to her.\u201cNangong Liuyun, behave. Don\u2019t get fresh with me.\u201d Su Luo\u2019s shapely eyebrows wrinkled slightly. She did not like to be in physical contact with people, so she wanted to push him away.But her hand was stopped in mid-air, because Nangong Liuyun was already using his large hands to wrap it around hers.Men and women were born with a disparity in their physical strength.Su Luo peevishly glared at him, but his face beamed with a cheeky grin.\u201cDon\u2019t be so stingy, I\u2019m really worn out.\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s slender and smooth finger hooked onto Su Luo\u2019s bright and clean tapered chin. The corner of his mouth was set into a roguish and enchanting smile as he spoke in a deep and husky voice. \u201cFor you, this king could be said to have rushed past a thousand li, or even travelled ten thousand li, and this is how you compensate this king?\u201d(TL: li = Chinese mile = .5 kilometers)Three days ago during the test at the Spirit Testing Temple. Su Luo\u2019s body had been covered in a mysterious, and freakishly abnormal spirit force.At that time, Nangong Liuyun left after escorting Su Luo home. He only left behind a few words, that after three days, he would come back and give her an explanation.Su Luo knew this matter would be difficult, so she already remembered this favor in her heart. She would definitely return this favor in her own way.With him lifting up her chin, Su Luo\u2019s vision coincidentally landed on his face.Suddenly, she stared at him blankly.His description of rushing past a thousand li, and traveling a distance even further that could possibly reach ten thousand li, did not seem to be an exaggeration.The Nangong Liuyun from three days ago was full of god like charm, was vibrantly handsome, pretty with extraordinary beauty, leisurely amorous, with incomparable grace.Though the him now still was as pretty as before, and was still extraordinarily handsome, he looked completely travel worn and grimness coated his face. Looking carefully, his lower eyelids had a hint of a blue-green color, and traces of exhaustion could be seen all over his face.Even when exhausted, the depths of his eyes still rippled with devilish charm and an enchantingly light smile. His obsidian-like eyes glistening with light, and every leisure gesture exuded the highest quality of a king\u2019s domineering air. What was also difficult to hide, was his extremely refined elegance and charisma.Su Luo\u2019s heart was slightly moved.To say that her heart was completely unmoved at this time, would obviously be impossible. After all, she was not made out of wood and completely lacked emotion. But to say that it was love would truly be out of the question.In fact, Su Luo had yet to realize how difficult and dangerous this thousand li trip Nangong Liuyun made to Sinking Sunset Peak truly was. It was simply beyond what the current her could imagine.But Nangong Liuyun still continued to roguishly and enchantingly smile. Not a hint of these hardships could be seen on his face, to the point where Su Luo could not even guess at the real difficulty of this trip.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This king personally lifted his foot to fish around for information but your expression is still neither cold nor hot. How can this be allowed? Come, give this king a kiss first.\u201dWhile Nangong Liuyu was speaking he already took the opportunity to lean into her.Not waiting for the touch of his soft lips, Su Luo immediately pushed him away: \u201cNangong Liuyun. You are the dignified, stately Prince Jin, the rumored legendary outstandingly talented genius. How can you be so shamefully? Aren\u2019t you afraid of being made fun of if this were to be leaked out?\u201d\u201cSilly girl, this king only treats you like this, so how could other people know?\u201d Nangong Liuyun happily laughed while pinching Su Luo\u2019s pink cheeks.This girl\u2019s fuming expression was so adorable and so lovable, that he had to pinch her again.Su Luo glared at him unhappily. \u201cSit properly, stop trying to touch me.\u201dBut Nangong Liuyun had been running around for three days, so he didn\u2019t have a chance to get intimately close to her then, how could he so easily let go of such an opportunity? The corner of his mouth hooked into a nefarious smile as his enticingly enchanting deep and beautiful eyes captivatingly stared at Su Luo.This demon!Su Luo\u2019s face had a speechless expression. Suddenly, the corner of her eyes bent slightly as it flashed with cynicism. \u201cNangong Liuyun, is it because you didn\u2019t find an explanation that you are purposefully trying to distract me?\u201dGoading him was really useful.\u201cReally, clever girls are no fun.\u201d Nangong Liuyun sighed. Although he did not win an inch while wanting a mile, he also did not plan on releasing Su Luo. He suddenly became serious, looked at Su Luo cautiously, and slowly stressed each word. \u201cGirl, tell me, recently, do you often get dizzy spells?\u201dSu Luo saw a never before seen serious expression on his face and her heart faintly trembled with fear. What\u2019s going on? The formerly harmonious smiling expression had now become this deadpan. She was still not used to such an abrupt shift .Su Luo thought about it, nodded her head, and answered: \u201cIndeed, sometimes I get headaches.\u201dNot only that, she would also get very dizzy and sleepy to the point that she really wanted to go sleep\u2026 and after falling asleep, it was hard to wake her up.Su Luo suddenly had a feeling that it was as if she might have a serious illness.\u201cDoes your dantian feel bloated? Does it feel hard when you touch it?\u201d Nangong Liuyun hastily followed up with another question.(TL: Dantian \u2013 a point below the navel where one\u2019s qi/energy pools at.)But he had a strange and complicated expression on his face. Su Luo had never seen this earnest and serious concentration on his face. This serious expression also seem to hold a touch of hope in it.His large hands that were holding Su Luo suddenly tightened. It was sufficient to prove that he was anxious in his heart.Something that could make the legendary Prince Jin anxious to this extent should not be a trivial matter. Then, what exactly is happening to her body?Su Luo\u2019s heart felt as if it was being pressed down upon by heavy boulders. Suddenly, it felt somewhat suffocating.But then, she thought about it again.How much worse could it get? She was already a good-for-nothing. At worst, she just won\u2019t be able to practice martial arts in the future.Su Luo slowly exhaled her muddy feelings. She calmly looked at him, casually said. \u201cYes, sometimes I feel bloated, what does that mean?\u201dPreviously, she just assumed that her menstrual cycle was about to begin so she did not pay it too much thought. After all, this body was about 15 years old, getting her period was normal.But now, it seemed to be clear that they were not related.Momentarily, their surroundings became really quiet, quiet to the degree that a falling leaf could be heard.At this moment, time seemed to have stopped.Even the surrounding air seemed to contain an apprehensive stiffness.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only after quite some time did he slowly ask another question. \u201cHave you seen a ring before, a ring with an engraved dragon on it?\u201d\u201cDragon Ring?\u201d Su Luo abruptly cried out in surprise.Of course she had seen the Dragon Ring, how could she forget the Dragon Ring?In her previous life, the Dragon Ring was her last assignment. And it was also because of this Dragon Ring that she could ruthlessly thwart Yun Qi one last time.Back then, when she had been shaking the brocade box in front of Yun Qi, the box actually contained wedding rings. She had personally bought them with the intention of marrying Yun Qi.But unfortunately, Yun Qi had mistaken it for the Dragon Ring, and carelessly fell into her trap.At the last moment, before death, Su Luo swallowed the Dragon Ring, and immediately jumped off the cliff. Underneath the cliff, were the turbulent ocean waves.Even if she died, she would never give Yun Qi the opportunity to obtain the Dragon Ring.But why did Nangong Liuyun know about the existence of the Dragon Ring, enough to even ask about it?Back then, a wealthy guest had spend three billion US dollars to set up an assignment to look for this ring. What is so wonderful about this ring?Was her spirit traveling through space and time related to the Dragon Ring?All of a sudden, Su Luo became somewhat perplexed.\u201cYou know about the Dragon Ring?\u201d A complicated emotion flashed within Nangong Liuyun\u2019s pupils. His gaze closely watched Su Luo seemly afraid to miss any trace of emotion on her face.\u201cIndeed, I have seen it before, so what?\u201d Su Luo\u2019s expression had become cautious when she callously replied.But now, if asked to take out the Dragon Ring, it would be impossible.And even if they dissected her body, they still may not find the Dragon Ring. After all, the body that swallowed the Dragon Ring was not this current body.\u201cYou have swallowed it before, right?\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s expression had a touch of excitement.She never thought that with one phrase, Nangong Liuyun would be able to go straight to the crucial point.But why is he so excited?Su Luo warily looked at him. The corner of her mouth upturned into a smile, her hands linked into her arms, as her pair of liquid eyes held a frosty expression.She could only uneasily smile while observing him, and did not saying a word.\u201cDon\u2019t be so nervous, how could I harm you?\u201d Nangong Liuyun playfully squeezed her cheeks.This girl\u2019s cheek is pink and tender; with skin that glistened like amber, snowy white with spot of pink, it seem as if water can be squeezed out. It really feel good in my hand.Seeing Su Luo\u2019s frown, his pair of phoenix eyes brimmed with devilish allure and a charming smile. \u201cSilly girl, what kind of wild things are you imagining? The Dragon Ring has spiritual protection. If it is swallowed by the host and the host did not die from immediate bodily explosion, this means that the Dragon Ring has already recognize this host as its master. Even if others dissected this master, they still would not get the Dragon Ring because the master and the Dragon Ring would have already merged together.\u201dObserving the pleasantly smiling Nangong Liuyun, Su Luo spread out her hands. \u201cSorry, but being cautious and prudent is part of my nature, it may be hard to change that.\u201d\u201cBeing cautious and prudent is appropriate and would never need to be changed. Moreover, this king likes your ice-cold indifference that could repel a person a thousand li away.\u201d Nangong Liuyun overindulgently tapped her lovable and charming nose.\u201cAre you deliberately looking to be abused?\u201d Su Luo seemed puzzled. He doesn\u2019t want the ones delivered to his doorstep and rather pester her?\u201cIt\u2019s because you did not realize how captivating you are to people, silly girl.\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s deep black cold pupils exuded a faint luster.

He arrogantly waved his hands and childishly tilted his head away while carrying a tone of dislike. \u201cNot intimate enough.\u201dThis guy\u2026!Su Luo grinded her teeth.

Not even a bit of fun.\u201d\u201cThen go find some girl who\u2019s fun.\u201d Su Luo ignored him, and then turned her head away.\u201cHow could that be possible?

Where a light punishment would be a chopped hand, and a heavy punishment where they would become mincemeat?This alluring and devilish charming, lazy and lecherous, all smiles, sloppy appearance, was truly truly, that aloof and remote super talented person?This was not logical!Has this guy\u2019s soul also been switched? Su Luo speculated and was unable to stop herself from staring at him.Due to Su Luo\u2019s unblinking gaze, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s heart become apprehensive. He shivered a little and weakly asked: \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d\u201cI want to dissect you and have a look to see if your soul has been switched.\u201d Su Luo sullenly replied.\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cWhat are you ehing about?

She had simply gleaned some knowledge from asking Lu Luo in the past few days.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s pair of dark translucent eyes glistened. His lips were dark red and moist. Moreover, its devilish charm and soft attractiveness was as red as the bloody red color of the Japanese rose. He carefully restrained her shoulders and stressed each word. \u201cIt means that you, Su Luo, in addition to the dual elements of wood and fire, you also possess the space element, now do you understand?\u201dNangong Liuyun had a face that was practically full of defeat. He had truly been defeated by Su Luo\u2019s luck.Space element huh. How rare was it in this continent? It could be described as extinct.\u201cSpace element mage?\u201d Su Luo was somewhat confused. She looked like a curious doll as she earnestly asked. \u201cIn this world, wasn\u2019t there only five major elements: wood, fire, wind, water, and lightning? How could there be an additional space element?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because, space mages had already disappeared from the continent a few hundred years ago. So later on everybody would just omitted the space element. Thus, what was originally the six major elements became the five major elements.\u201dNangong Liuyun was speechless, how could a person\u2019s luck be so good to such an extent?Innate spiritual talent at the high class purple rank.Elemental mage of dual attributes.With the great luck of them being the wood and fire dual elements. Now she could proudly practice to be an Apothecary.Moreover, she also was a long-lost mage of the space element!Ah, space element\u2026. just thinking about it would definitely make one drool.Although there were spatial rings still being passed down in this continent, the spatial ring, a storage device, simply could not be compared to a space mage\u2019s own space. They were two completely different concepts.Spatial ring was only a device for storage, but if one were to talk about a spage mage, his space is contained within his body. It would be comparable to making their own world. Additionally, this small world would gradually grow larger along with its owner\u2019s cultivation. In the end, nobody could tell to what extent it could become.Another point was that in this world, only space mages were about to produce spatial rings.Since space mages disappeared from the continent, the spatial rings were currently exceptionally expensive.Take Eastern Ling Empire for example. In the entire Eastern Ling Empire, only his majesty the Emperor had a spatial ring that only had a small area for storage.This was the so-called an ordinary man is innocent, but having a cherished item would get him into trouble.If people were informed that this girl was actually a space mage, in all probability, the continent\u2019s numerous powerful forces would act at once upon hearing this news, and vie to be the first to snatch her.And it was not only the well known and influential forces, there were some hidden aristocratic families who would not be able to resist the temptation of monopolizing her.After all, if they had a space mage, then it would mean the birth of new spatial rings. Although this is a matter further in the future, the thing these aristocratic families do not lack are time and patience.Su Luo literally has a mountain of treasure at her disposal but was currently powerless to defend it. Fortunately, the only people who are currently aware of this matter were the two of them.Nangong Liuyun solemnly said to Su Luo. \u201cGirl, this Dragon Ring matter, you absolutely can not let anyone know. Otherwise, even this king would not be able to protect you.\u201dSu Luo was an assassin in her previous life, so it was natural for her to know about the complexity of human nature and their greed. She nodded her head and seriously replied. \u201cI will naturally not speak about it. But what is the relationship between the Dragon Ring and my problem with my wood and fire dual elemental power?\u201d\u201cThe relationship between them is complicated.

As for this Celestial Spirit Water\u2026\u201d Nangong Liuyun paused a little as a nefarious and charming smile appeared, enticingly stared at her with a hidden meaning. \u201cIt is in fact as far away as the end of the earth, yet is also right in front of your eyes.\u201d\u201cOh? Could it be in Su Manor?\u201d Su Luo\u2019s curly, thick silky black eyelashes fluttered like butterfly wings. She looked as beautiful and naughty as a fine porcelain doll.She did not even have half a favorable impression of the Su Manor. If really was here, then it would just be simple and convenient.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s smile seemed to be able to charm all living things; it was enchanting and wild. He looked confident and at ease as he waved a fan. \u201cWhat a smart girl. You hit the mark with one guess. The Celestial Spirit Water just happens to be inside your Su Manor, and it\u2019s also Su Manor most heavily guarded treasure.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s actually here, what are we waiting for? There\u2019s no time to lose.\u201d Su Luo\u2019s clear eyes lightly smiled again.Since it\u2019s Su Manor\u2019s precious treasure, then she won\u2019t be impolite and kindly accept it.\u201cYou\u2019re going to find your honored father to ask for it?\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s beautiful pair of eyes harbored a sinister charm.A breeze gently brushed away Su Luo\u2019s beautiful jet black hair, making her seemed almost gentle, beautiful and sweet tempered. But the expression in her eyes was as incomparably apathetic as before. The words she said matched her expression. \u201cAsk for it? How could I asked for it? I\u2019m obviously going to steal it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s actually not necessary. You can just tell your honorable father that you have wood and fire as dual elements and is a future space mage. Once he knows that, he\u2019ll be happy for you. Then wouldn\u2019t the Celestial Spirit Water would be handed to you?\u201d\u201cAre you seriously stupid or are you pretending to be stupid?\u201d Su Luo hit him without reservation. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re actually stupid but I\u2019m certainly not stupid. My family\u2019s honorable father is cold, detached, unkind, and selfish without regard for others. Forget about whether or not he would actually believe my words, so what if if he believed them? In his heart I\u2019m only a tool to be exchanged at for his benefit. As long as someone is wealthy enough to give an offer that can tempt him, he would not hesitate to sell me. Also, Nangong Liuyun, don\u2019t use this method to incite me. It\u2019s meaningless.\u201d\u201cWhat a sharp girl.\u201d Suddenly, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s gentle laugh appeared. The sound was kind, indolent, and extremely pleasant to hear. While laughing, he used his fan to gently tap Su Luo\u2019s bright forehead.As expected, this girl did not disappoint him.If it was a normal girl who had been bullied for more than ten years, who woke up one morning to find out that her innate talent was actually extraordinary and peerless under the heavens, the first thing she would do was announce it to the whole world.But Su Luo, she was the same,Yet with her kind of unwavering determination and patient nature, he was certain that she would walk very very far in the distant future\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When facing him, she never knew what one would call mercy. Who told him to be such a scoundrel?\u201cSince you understand, then this king\u2019s heart is at ease.\u201d Nangong Liuyun patted her head, with his eyes containing a simile not yet a smile sort of meaning.He really was worried that this girl momentarily could not contain her excitement and speak about this matter to Su Zian.After all, he was very clear about what kind of person Su Zian was.Fortunately, even though this Su girl had been bullied for so many years, she was not timid, nor did she have an inferior complex. Instead of being spoiled or disgraced, shocked or perturbed, she was calm. It even seemed like if Mt. Tai were to collapse, her expression would remain the same.This kind of temperament should not have appear in a fifteen year old girl, but she was able to do it.She was indeed worthy of being the girl that he, Nangong Liuyun fancied. As expected, she was clever enough.Nangong Liuyun nodded his head, with a comforting expression.\u201cThere is no need to delay. Since I have already decided to steal the Celestial Spirit Water, then another day may not be as good as today, is today good enough?\u201d Su Luo said with a calm and elegant expression. Her white muslin robes danced gracefully, making her look like a quietly elegant beautiful celestial being, as her fair skin shined with the luster of ice and gems.She tilted her small palm sized face and fixed her gaze on Nangong Liuyun. With her beautiful eyes that had the expression of tempest tossed water, lips that seemed to contain red powder, she was indescribably alluring.Facing such a charming and captivating small face, Nangong Liuyun discovered that he could not utter a word of refusal to participate in her scheme. He closed his fan and tapped it on the table. \u201cOkay, whatever you say goes.\u201dIn his eyes, Su Manor was not an impenetrable fortress. The most powerful existence in Su Manor was the guardian of the Hidden Treasure Pavilion who was merely a sixth step expert.And he, was currently also at the sixth step. They should be equally matched, and neither should overpower the other.Consequently, the two discussed the appropriate strategies and started their preparations.They put on pitch-black clothing appropriate for the night and stuffed their hair into a black scarf. Even their faces were covered with a layer of black cloth.Their bodies were entirely shrouded in black, for only a pair of fresh, quick-witted and tempest tossed eyes were exposed.Just when they were about to leave, the corner of Su Luo\u2019s mouth hooked into a shallow smile, as a crafty and sinister expression glowed from her eyes.She retrieved the purple fish jade pendant from under her pillow, and raised her slender eyebrows with a particular excitement. After that, she stuffed the jade pendant close to her bosom, and then turned to blink at Nangong Liuyun. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThis jade pendant actually belonged to Su Jingyu. If it was accidently left in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion\u2026 Ouch! Just thinking about it would make one\u2019s blood boil wildly; with 10,000% excitement!Even if she didn\u2019t get anything from this trip, with just this jade pendant, she would earn back her initial investment.She just happened to want to anger her selfish and greedy father to death. Who told him to be so cold, detached and heartless?She just happened to use this to frame Su Jingyu. Who told him to bully and frame her?Since he started it first, then don\u2019t blame her for finishing it.Nangong Liuyun saw Su Luo\u2019s eyes jump with excitement and a smile flashed from the depth of his eyes.Even though at this time, he could not guess at what this girl was thinking of doing, he still knew that this girl liked to toy with people she had a grudge on. It was unknown who would be out of luck this time.It looks like, if he wanted to chase this girl into his hands, then he would have to expend a lot of effort.Sure enough, really smart and clever girls were hard to fool. Nangong Liuyun was itching to beat his chest and stomp his feet.No matter what, this girl would eventually be sleeping in his bed in the future. If chasing fails, then he would use deception. If deception fails, then he would continue to chase\u2026 After all he had plenty of time. In the future, he would just latch onto her.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The few remaining stars hanging upon it were dim. The moonlight was obscured by very thick clouds, with feeble light seeping through.In brief, it could be summarized into one short phrase: a moonless high wind night. It was the best day to commit a crime.In the dark of night, two black silhouettes quietly disappeared from the farthest and smallest courtyard in Su Manor with a leopard\u2019s gracefulness.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s speed was like lightning. Even though he was carrying Su Luo, he was still extremely fast.The heavily guarded Manor of Great General Su, the protector of the country, was a place that made others flinch in fear. Yet he actually appeared to look casual, confident, and at ease; as if he was taking a leisurely stroll through his own back garden.Nangong Liuyun was at attention, was sober and calm, and was also on sharp alert. He seem to be capable of anticipating danger in advance.He lead Su Luo; sometimes they walked, and sometimes they stopped here and there. They occasionally hid in the shadows, hid in flowering shrubs once in a while, and sometimes flew on the top of trees. He was always one step ahead of the guards and was always well hidden when the patrol walked by.Su Luo carefully memorized the route they walked in and the patrols they encountered with narrowed eyes and pupils dilated from the exhilaration.It had been a long time since she felt this kind of blood boiling excitement.What \u201cleave the organization and live in seclusion within the forest and mountains\u201d? As expected, in her bones, she really liked this type of crisis ridden dangerous situation; it truly made a person\u2019s heart accelerate.The corners of Su Luo\u2019s mouth tiled into a smile of exhilaration.Soon they arrived at the Hidden Treasure Pavilion.The Hidden Treasure Pavilion was forbidden ground built in Su Manor\u2019s backyard. This place was not an area that a normal person could get close to.The Hidden Treasure Pavilion was only three stories high. The outside looked very plain and old; it completely lacked any magnificent and luxurious feelings.At this time, the interior of the Hidden Treasure Pavilion was pitch-black. Not a trace of lamplight could be seen, and its main entrance was locked with a special mysterious iron padlock.The mysterious iron padlock shone with a sliver of cold light under the moonlight.The gate was not protected by a guard and was also soundless.Nangong Liuyun made a simple gesture towards Su Luo, signaling that he would lure the opponents out for Su Luo to take the opportunity to enter and plunder.In her previous life, Su Luo did a lot of similar stuff like this, so Su Luo clearly understood and nodded her head.Nangong Liuyun indulgently patted her head. Under Su Luo\u2019s glowering gaze, he lifted his mouth into a devilishly charming smile, took the lead, and walked out.His movements were very fast. He was like a flash of light and onlookers could scarcely see his figure. Even if they could see it clearly, they would only see a clump of shadows, and perhaps believed that their vision had become hazy.His footsteps were even more agile. He was like a dragonfly that skipped on water; his footsteps seemed as if they never touched the ground.Nangong Liuyun turned his body around like a sparrow hawk; his foot stepped off the ground and flew towards the second floor of the Hidden Treasure Pavilion. But right at this moment, in the depths of the darkness, a strong wind suddenly headed directly toward him.He\u2019s here!Nangong Liuyun\u2019s handsome face that was hidden behind the mask spread out into a smile. He did not retreat. From the pit of his stomach, he raised together a red-hot halo directly into his palm. Borrowing the power of the wind to strongly strike, he maneuvered it to mount a sneak attack against that person.The sneak attack was mounted against none other than the guardian of the Hidden Treasure Pavilion.This was a black robed elderly man. Only a body enveloped in the black robe could be seen; even his head was covered by a black mantle, and his face could not be clearly seen. But one could feel his ice-cold and murderous eyes.If one spoke about seniority in the family hierarchy, this was Su Luo\u2019s second great uncle.He was Su Luo\u2019s grandfather\u2019s second little brother. Since he was a child, he grew up immersed in martial arts. When he was young, he wandered the world but now came back, returned to the family, and guarded the Hidden Treasure Pavilion all year round.It was also because of this sixth step expert for a guardian that there were only visitors and no successful robberies of any kind. Instead, they all lost their lives.Therefore, from then on, the Hidden Treasure Pavilion only had this sixth step expert for a guardian.This was Su Manor\u2019s secret. Outsiders were not aware of this, but naturally, Nangong Liuyun was an exception.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She could only use her peripheral vision to see a little.Su Bowu coldly stared at Nangong Liuyun as a trace of murderous intent flashed across his eyes: \u201cThe Treasure Pavilion is sacred ground. Unauthorized people should turn around and leave immediately.\u201dNangong Liuyun laughed but his eyes were freezing cold. His manner was completely different from how he acted in front of Su Luo, \u201cAnd if I insist on entering?\u201d\u201cKill without regard!\u201d Su Bowu\u2019s voice was heartlessly grim and unfeeling. It faintly penetrated the dark night with a hair raising feeling of horror.His voice revealed his self-assured confidence.Over the years in the Su Manor, the Hidden Treasure Pavilion was always very safe because it was protected by this sixth step elder. Throughout the entire Eastern Ling Empire, there were very few who were stronger than a sixth step expert; they could all be counted on one hand.This was why Su Bowu could have such confidence.Prince Jin\u2019s entire body was hidden beneath a layer of black garments; the corner of his mouth curled up into a smile as his eyes flashed with an insolent fierceness: \u201cKill without regard? Then let\u2019s see who will kill whom.\u201d\u201cSuch arrogance! Since you want to die so much, then this old man will grant your wish!\u201d Su Bowu\u2019s mouth curled into an icy sneer, as his eyes now brimmed with murderous intent. A pair of eyes with a sinister gaze stared at Nangong Liuyun as if he was looking at a dead man.After guarding the Hidden Treasure Pavilion for so many years, it was not as if he had never seen a thief before, but he had ever guarded against such an arrogant thief before.Su Bowu had just barely finished speaking when a pair of scorching hot Iron Sand Palms was sent to attack Nangong Liuyun. The wind send by the palm carried a flaming blaze that was hot enough to roast a person.Su Bowu was a fire attribute mage. As a young man, he travelled across the entire world and his Iron Sand Palms were famous throughout the entire Eastern Ling Empire.He was obviously infuriated by Nangong Liuyun since his first move was a killing strike.Each move was heartless and unfeeling with a strong intent to kill.Nangong Liuyun did not panic; the corner of his mouth slightly smirked as his eyes coldly pressured. His entire body was covered in thick unyielding power and awe-inspiring dignity.The Iron Sand Palm brought a flaming blaze that aggressively headed toward him with threatening heat.Nangong Liuyun turned both of his hands and clasped them together. As soon as he separated them, a huge round ball of water was pulled from the center of his palm and ejected forward\u2014\u2014When the Iron Sand Palm meet the ball of water, it was immediately extinguished.A touch of astonishment flashed across Su Bowu\u2019s eyes. He never thought that this thief would have such high martial skills; unexpectedly, the thief was able to break through his most famous move.\u201cGood, since you\u2019re wholeheartedly begging to die, then have a taste of my Hell Fire!\u201d Su Bowu\u2019s voice barely ended before both his hands successfully agglomerated individual fireballs. One after another, the fireballs attacked Nangong Liuyun and completely surrounded him in all directions.\u201cAh\u2014\u2014\u201d Nangong Liuyun was unable to suppress a sudden cry of pain. His right hand held onto his left arm as he fiercely glared at Su Bowu. \u201cAs long as the mountains stand and rivers flow, till we meet again!\u201dThe sound of his voice had not dropped and he simply withdrew using a strange skill. But there was clearly a trace of shakyness to his stature, and he seem to be heavily injured.\u201cYou want to come and go as you please? What kind of place do you think Su Manor is? Stay!\u201d Su Bowu coldly snorted a few times and countless number of small fireballs shot towards Nangong Liuyun.But it seemed as if Nangong Liuyun had eyes on the back of his head. He strangely dodged and side-stepped, and just couldn\u2019t get hit.This time, he really angered Su Bowu!He coldly snorted a few more times, and immediately moved his body to give chase!But outside of his expectations, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s speed did not seem to slow down as he aimlessly fled all over Su Manor.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His heart become even more furious as he fiercely vowed to capture this shameless little thief and give him some serious punishment.But how could he possibly know that Nangong Liuyun was not wounded, and was merely just initiating the stratagem of moving the tiger from the mountain.The two person in pursuit were not quiet, and attracted a lot of people\u2019s attention.Poor Su Bowu closely pursued without letting go, so he did not know that Su Luo on the other corner began to move.Su Luo saw that all around her was quiet. There was not even a trace of a human shadow, and the corner of her mouth slowly raised into a sly smiling expression.Indeed, this was the great Nangong Liuyun; his use of moving the tiger from the mountain was really entertaining.At first Su Luo thought that Nangong Liuyun really did get hurt, but after seeing him having the relaxed frame of mind to throw her flirtatious glances while running away, she was reassured.The mysterious iron lock was made by the number one cleverest craftsman in Eastern Ling; the lock\u2019s core was complicated and hard to solve, but this was merely to resist and unnerve others.Having opened a variety of complex modern locks, Su Luo could not be stumped by this lock.She retrieved a small thin hairpin and use it to fiddle around within the keyhole, both eyes vigilantly watched her surroundings, ears listening for movements in all directions.Caution and prudence was her entire body\u2019s instinct.She wholeheartedly used all three of her senses; her hand movement did not seem to slow down for she was quite familiar with this fiddling movement.\u201cClick\u2026.\u201d in less than ten seconds, the legendary unconquerable mysterious iron lock fell into ruin in Su Luo\u2019s hand.Thus, Su Luo quietly opened the lock, then hung it back on the door, and entered the room. Then she quietly closed the door with an movement that resembled moving clouds and flowing water, and smoothly completed in one go.This lock was said to be made by the world\u2019s number one cleverest craftsman, but under Su Luo\u2019s omnipotent ability to open all locks, it collapsed at the first blow, and it was quickly cracked.Entering the first floor of the Hidden Treasure Pavilion, Su Luo would not dare to light a lamp, because once a lamp gets lit in the room, assuredly, it was telling people: thieves are here, quickly catch them!Fortunately Su Luo\u2019s vision was superb; to others this scene was pitch-dark, but for her, the line of sight was only slightly blurred.The first floor lobby contains lots of shelves made out of pear tree wood. Every nook was also lined with small iron boxes and trunks.Su Luo looked at it one by one. She discovered that they just common gold, silver, and pearl jewelry, while the iron boxes were full of gold and silver bars.Although this stuff was very useful, she was only one person, and essentially cannot take them away.Su Luo sighed with some regret and several reluctant-to-part backward glances at the valuable gold and silver treasure. Finally, she firmly turned around and nimbly stepped on the staircase, walking up step by step.The stuff on the second floor was a little better than those on the first floor. It was full of rare medicinal herbs; Ginseng as thick as the back of one\u2019s hand, thousand year old Lingzhi Mushroom, Sky Mountain Snow Lotus and other types of very old medicinal herbs.The air permeated with a dense herbal aroma.Su Luo felt around for a long time at that place, but still did not find the Celestial Spirit water that she need.She secretly become anxious; she did not know where this treasure is hidden.After much contemplation, the possibility that it was on the third floor was the greatest.Su Luo\u2019s foot briefly touched the ground. With lithe agility, she reached for the staircase and after one sweeping movement, her figure flashed pass and arrived at the entrance to the third floor staircase.She knew that now she needed to increase her pace.Don\u2019t know how much longer Nangong Liuyun can stall Su Bowu.If Su Bowu were to mentally recover, he would clearly see through this stratagem of moving the tiger from the mountain and return. She would then bump into him head on and this good-for-nothing would not be able to beat him.Or if her father Su Zian heard the movements inside Su Manor, with meticulous care would come and inspect the Hidden Treasure Pavilion. Then she really will be exposed, at that time she won\u2019t even know how to cry.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If it was not here, then she did not know what else she could doThe space on the third floor was much smaller than the two floors below.Also, the shelves were crowded with books. This gave Su Luo much more work to do.When Su Luo took a closer and more careful look, she realized that they were not martial art secrets, but some general history of the continent and as well as some of the principles and practice of the six major elements.How strange, these were common books, why treasure them enough to put it on the third floor?Logically, wouldn\u2019t the third floor have the most precious treasures?Su Luo was a bit confused.Eh?\u2014\u2014 As Su Luo\u2019s eyes fell off the shelves, her body suddenly paused and her eyes flashed with a trace of excitement.With her carefully honed killer instinct, she noticed that the books in the front of the shelf seemed amiss.This collection was placed in a purple wooden box, a total of nine were standing vertically on the shelf.The reason why it was so strange, was because the other books were covered in dust. But these books\u2026They seemed to be touched often by somebody; the surface of the book was smooth and clean.It was also possible that the owner cherished it a lot and would wipe it oftenSu Luo\u2019s mouth dropped into a sly smile.This was it.Su Luo\u2019s hand played around with the box. However, there was not the slightest reaction.How come?Su Luo slightly wrinkled her eyebrows as she thought about it, and then decided to take the books out one by one.She would move one book out, stop, then carefully listen if anything happened.When she got to the sixth book, she suddenly felt the book was stuck. But no matter what she did, she couldn\u2019t get it out.When she took another careful look over the book, she suddenly laughed. As expected, this book was the most important.Suddenly, the book she was holding had been abruptly taken out.\u201cWooosh\u2014\u2014\u201d A small sound suddenly resounded in the dark, Su Luo discovered that the sound came from below her feet.Su Luo faced the direction the sound came from and took a look.At this time, one meter in front of her, the floor slowly opened, revealing a small black hole about the size of ten square centimeters; something that you wouldn\u2019t see if you weren\u2019t looking carefully.Su Luo went over, crouched down, and was surprised to see a small palm-sized box.The small box was made of rosewood, surrounded by a faint rosewood fragrance.The small box was not locked, so Su Luo could easily open it.Inside the box was a small jade bottle.Su Luo looked at it carefully. It was a flawlessly white jade bottle, with no labels on its surface; just from its exterior, it was fundamentally impossible to see anything.Su Luo slowly opened the bottle and sniffed it. Suddenly, an unknown fragrance spread out.It was fresh and elegant; this smell made people relax.This kind of fragrance was exactly the same as what Nangong Liuyun had described.Turns out this was Celestial spirit water.It was really acquired too easily.But this was also thanks to Su Luo\u2019s professionalism from the past. If she wasn\u2019t so careful in all aspects, even if she searched the entire Hidden Treasure Pavilion, it would\u2019ve been impossible to find.Su Luo took the small bottle of water together with the box into her arms.It was not because she liked the rosewood box, but because she had another use for it. Not only that, it would be very useful too.Now that she had already gotten what she wanted, it was natural to quickly leave.But before withdrawing, that purple fish jade pendant shall be of great use.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Framed me? Then I\u2019ll let you experience what it\u2019s really like to be wrongly accused and to be framed!Giving him a taste of his own medicine; Su Luo was very familiar with this type of thing.Looking at that tiny black hole, Su Luo\u2019s mouth tilted into a smirk, and then ruthlessly tossed the jade fish pendant into the hole. Moreover, she did not even bother to close the mechanism and immediately prepared to leave.But at this time, suddenly from outside the sound of hubbub could be heard.Faintly, torch light could be seen coming closer.Su Luo moved close to the window and looked out, her heart tensed.What bad luck. Su Zian really did bring people over.Looks like he was not that stupid. He finally thought to check on the Hidden Treasure Pavilion.Originally, if she did not find the Celestial Spirit water in the Hidden Treasure Pavilion, Su Luo planned to conceal herself in the hidden corners on the third floor.Humans had innate habits. If Su Zian saw the disorder on the third floor, his first reaction was to check on the most precious treasure in his collection and look to see if it was stolen. This way, Su Luo who was hiding in a dark corner could clearly see the place where he stashed the treasure.But now, since she had already obtained the Celestial Spirit water from the box, she did not have to waste more effort.But Su Luo could totally imagine it. When her cheap father walked up to the third floor and sees the disordered scene in front of him, it was very likely that he would be so furious that he might even die from anger.Just thinking about this made Su Luo\u2019s mood especially happy.Seeing that the pursuing force was about to arrive, Su Luo did not panic then. Many years as an assassin had trained her to possess formidable courage and wisdom.She did not go downstairs. Rather, she nimbly climbed out the window, and with a leopard cat grace and quickness, quietly slid down the pillar.With an effort that lasted a blink of an eye, she now stood at the foot of the wall.At this time, she did not flee in the direction of her distant courtyard, but towards Su Jingyu\u2019s courtyard.On the pathway not far from Su Jingyu\u2019s courtyard, Su Luo unfortunately came across a person. This person was none other than the person Su Luo ruthlessly kicked into the wall three days ago, until she fainted dead away, Nanny Gui.Nanny Gui had just regained consciousness today. She struggled to get up because she want to go to Madam\u2019s courtyard, tattletale to the Madam about who severely wounded her, and also had to tell Madam to carefully guard against that Fourth Miss.So at this time, Nanny Gui, with the support of a maid, slowly walked toward Madam\u2019s courtyard step by step.Madam\u2019s courtyard was very close to Su Jingyu\u2019s courtyard. This narrow cobblestoned path was the only route, so she and Su Luo met face to face on this narrow path.As a result, when Su Luo violently charged out of the side path, she saw Nanny Gui at first glance.\u201cAHH\u2014\u2014\u201d When the little maid saw the masked person in black cloth, she subconsciously shouted out loud.Nanny Gui originally could resist for a while, but who told her not to heal first from her serious wounds? Her head was knocked until it was confused and dizzy; her butt ached to the point that it felt as if it would cracked wide open. Thus, she did not have the strength or time to put up any resistance. Su Luo chopped towards her with a knife in hand and immediately killed off Nanny Gui.Originally, Su Luo did not wish to kill Nanny Gui, but she could see at a glance that Nanny Gui was unsettled and this old witch was currently heading toward Madam\u2019s courtyard; she was going there to tattletale.The current Su Luo did not have the slightest spirit strength, so on this continent, she didn\u2019t even have the strength to protect herself. Consequently, she had keep a low-profile at the moment.

Thus, Su Luo made a preemptive strike to kill Nanny Gui, and the death would end all her troubles.In any case, Nanny Gui\u2019s offense was the former mistreatment of this body\u2019s original owner, so she should have died long ago!Moreover, since she was now dead, this would also get rid of Madam\u2019s right hand man. Acting upon her own matters would be much easier in the future.This was a move that would let her gain many benefits, which was why Su Luo in one strike hacked Nanny Gui to death without the slightest of hesitation .However, Su Luo let the little maid go and only knocked her unconscious.Because it was useful to leave the maid alive, as at a future time, she might be expected to testify.After disposing those two, Su Luo rapidly sped up as her figure flashed away like lightning.Her footsteps temporarily stopped, then darted toward Su Jingyu\u2019s Heaven and Earth courtyard. Her small body was like that of an leopard cat, light and nimble.Not long after, she arrived at the Heaven and Earth courtyard.Tonight, Su Jinyu did not go out, and instead stayed in his room to cultivate.\u201cThere\u2019s an assassin!\u201d Su Luo lowered her voice and deliberately shouted out.She purposefully created a racket outside so the people in the courtyard could see a black shadow leaping in.\u201cThere\u2019s an assassin, capture the assassin!\u201dThere was no end to the people swiftly calling out the same warning.Su Jingyu\u2019s brows tightly knitted because in his eyes, this noise disturbed his cultivation.But the clamor outside seemed to have the tendency to only get bigger and bigger.He had no choice but to stand up and walk out his door.And at the exact time he walked out, Su Luo nevertheless, took advantage of the confusion and quietly flashed into the interior of the room.Seeing that not a soul was in sight, the corner of her mouth raised into a wicked sneer. In regards to the next item in this program, she was really really enthusiastically looking forward to it.Su Jingyu ah, Su Jingyu. You were the one who walked out to give me this opportunity. When that time comes, you can\u2019t really blame me.Su Luo swiftly removed the small box from her bosom and picked up the bottle of Celestial Spirit Water. She was just about to close the box when right at that time\u2014\u2014Borrowing the bright candlelight, she saw a slip of old-fashioned paper pressed underneath the box. She picked it up to get a closer look and discovered that the paper looked like a map. But it had crooked lines and was hard to comprehend.And also this map was incomplete. It ought to be only a quarter of the original map.What kind of map is this? It\u2019s also suffused in yellow. It seems to be really old. Su Luo frowned as a trace of uncertainty flashed across her eyes.But it was placed together with the Celestial Spirit Water so presumably, it was also something precious. After all, she could not let Su Jingyu off so lightly.Based on her \u201ctake any advantage presented and not taking would be stupid\u201d moral principle, Su Luo simply collected the map into her bosom.Then she took off her black cloth, the cloth wrapped around her face and hair, and even the brocade box. All of it were stuffed together under the bed.Her actions were extremely fast; the matter was completed before the time it takes a flint to light a fire.As she looked at the things stuffed underneath the bed that deliberately exposed a little bit of black cloth, Su Luo\u2019s mouth hooked into a cold smile.Su Jingyu, is it fun to wrongly accuse someone? Then I\u2019ll let you really have fun playing this game. Hopefully, you won\u2019t play to death this time, because your little sister still has a lot of fun tricks waiting for you.Su Luo took one last glance at the room. After confirming that she did not leave any errors, she lept out the window and her small body rapidly vanished into the blackness of the dark night.On the other side, after Nangong Liuyun received Su Luo\u2019s signal, he quickly followed behind her in a spontaneous fashion and the growing tail of people headed toward Su Jingyu\u2019s Heaven and Earth courtyard.Since this was a framing, then she clearly must let this play be acted out fully.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At this moment, he was just about to enter the Hidden Treasure Pavilion.However, when he saw the chains hanging on the door, his facial expression became very ugly.This chain was made by the best craftsmen in the capital. It could only be opened by the key hanging on his body.But right now, this lock had been opened by someone else. Moreover, it was hanging in an obviously mocking manner.Su Zian\u2019s expression now became abnormally stiff. He pushed opened the door and loudly shouted with anger: \u201cLight the lamps!\u201dVery quickly, the guard at his side handed him a lantern. Soon after, he lit the candles in the room.The first floor looked messy and was in disorder. It only took a glance to clearly see that someone had rummaged through it.This thief was incomparably arrogant and brazen; he didn\u2019t even bother to put stuff back in place!He stepped onto the second floor.It was obvious that the second floor had also been rummaged through but it didn\u2019t seem as though anything was missing.But if this was the case\u2026 Su Zian\u2019s countenance became even more unsightly, because he knew that this thief must be an expert. If he was not impressed with the first and second floor, then his goal pointed to the third floor.Sure enough!When Su Zian walked to the third floor and saw the situation in hall, his brain immediately buzzed with noise. A sweet taste entered his throat and a mouthful of blood had almost been spat out on the spot.It only took him one glance to see the small black hole in the floorboard! It was the place where the Celestial Spirit Water was stored.Aside from his ancestors, only he knew about this place, but now it had been opened by someone else!Su Zian could only feel his limbs go numb, and he was almost unable to stand properly.Steadying his mind, he boosted his spirits to look forward and discovered that the wooden box stored there disappeared without a trace.So hateful, so aggravating!Su Zian was so infuriated that he threw up a mouthful of blood on the spot.The Celestial Spirit Water placed in that small box was the Su Manor\u2019s most precious treasure!But what angered him even more in addition to the Celestial Spirit Water, was the hidden treasure map. That hidden treasure map was actually the most precious thing!It was a map to open the legendary Secluded Necropolis of the Gods. Even the most powerful experts on the continent were searching for it. Although it was only a fragment, if this hidden treasure map were to appear, then the entire country will be in chaos.And now it had been stolen along with the Celestial Spirit Water.Su Zian\u2019s entire body trembled with fury and could not say anything for a while. He felt like he was going to go crazy.\u201cSearch! We must find the thieves!\u201d Hack them into pieces! Su Zian was so angry that he trembled from head to toe.Suddenly, his eyes saw something in the black hole. After picking it up, he saw a purple fish jade pendant.Could this purple fish jade pendant be left by the thieves?What is this? Steal something and leave something as a calling card? What arrogant brazen thieves!Su Zian believed that if this thief was standing in front of him right now, he would definitely strangle him to death.Unfortunately, he did not know that the thief he hated until his teeth itched, was actually his good-for-nothing daughter who did not know any martial arts.\u201cTake this jade pendant to the Mercenary Union. Ask them to find all the information regarding this jade pendant as soon as possible!\u201d Su Zian believed that if he found the origin of this jade pendant, then tonight\u2019s thieves would not be able to hide.He must find the thieves and let them see that Su Manor was not a place where they could come and go as they pleased!But at this time, the guard\u2019s manner seemed hesitant. It seemed as if he wanted to speak but stopped.\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you left yet!\u201d Su Zian angrily roared.\u201cGreat general, this jade pendant\u2026. This, this humble servant has seen it before.\u201d The guard hesitantly hummed and hawed.\u201cYou\u2019ve seen it before?

If he wronged the young master, then that would mean\u2026 At this time, he was so regretful that he want to slap himself in the face. If only he did not say anything a moment ago.\u201cSpeak!\u201d Su Zian kicked toward the guard and heavily flipped him to the ground.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026. It\u2019s the young master!\u201d The guard spat out a mouth of blood because of the kick. He covered his stomach and loudly exclaimed, \u201cThis jade pendant belongs to the young master!\u201d\u201cWhat did you say!\u201d Su Zian severely kicked him again, \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have named anyone?

That thief disappeared after entering young master\u2019s courtyard?\u201d Su Zian\u2019s cold expression became terrifying. He grabbed the servant\u2019s collar with a cruel and fierce expression, \u201cRepeat what you just said!\u201dThis guard did not know what had happened here; he was only here to report what had happened so when Su Zian lifted him up by the collar, he had a puzzled expression on his face, but he still disjointedly repeated. \u201cThis servant is not lying, that thief really did disappear in young master\u2019s courtyard. Also\u2026 Also Nanny Gui was killed on the path not too far from Young Master\u2019s courtyard, there is also a maid as proof\u2026.\u201dNow, almost all of the evidence pointed to Su Jingyu.However, Su Zian still would not believe it.Su Jingyu was the son he highly regarded. He was none other than the Su Manor\u2019s successor; he simply did not have a reason to do this!Not possible, this is absolutely impossible!No matter what was said Su Zian could not believe that the son he had personally educated would betray him.But the thief really did disappear into the Heaven and Earth courtyard, so he had to personally go and clear up this matter.Su Zian took a group of people and the grandiose parade of people darted towards the Heaven and Earth courtyard.As they arrived at the Heaven and Earth courtyard, he found Su Bowu confronting Su Jingyu.\u201cJingyu!\u201d Su Zian coldly stared at him, \u201c What do you think you are doing? Deceive your teacher and wipe out the tribe?\u201dSu Jingyu was just about to fight with Su Bowu, but after seeing Su Zian, he hurriedly said toward Su Zian: \u201cFather, you\u2019re finally here, you must help and make the decision! I really don\u2019t know what happened, but Second Grand Uncle keeps on vigorously insisting that I am a thief.\u201dSu Zian looked at Su Bowu.Su Bowu sneered : \u201cIf it\u2019s not you then who? That thief is hiding in your courtyard. If you are innocent, then why won\u2019t you let people search it?\u201cSecond Uncle\u2026\u201d Su Zian was just about to speak, but was interrupted by Su Bowu.\u201cZian, Second Uncle personally saw the thief run into the Heaven and Earth courtyard. Even if Jingyu is your son, he can not escape this responsibility.\u201d That thief was heavily wounded and walked with wavering steps; he simply could not have run far. If not for Su Jingyu strongly blocking the path, then he would have already caught the culprit.Su Zian\u2019s entire face filled with grief as he finally closed his eyes, and painfully said: \u201cSecond uncle\u2026 The Hidden Treasure Pavilion was robbed.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say!\u201d Su Bowu\u2019s facial expression suddenly changed. It become ugly, \u201cWhat was stolen?\u201d\u201cCelestial Spirit Water, and also\u2026 the hidden treasure map\u2026.\u201d Su Zian was so depressed that he wanted to hit the wall!Su Bowu\u2019s expression become even more ugly. He unsteadily swayed and almost spit out a mouth full of blood.He only realized now, that the opponent had used the stratagem of moving the tiger from the mountain!The opponent tricked him away and afterwards, another person took the opportunity to sneak into the Hidden Treasure Pavilion.

If you are proven to be innocent, then nobody can wrongly accuse you.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he waved his hands, expression full of dignity: \u201cGo in and search!\u201dAt the sound of the order, a troop of over twenty guards immediately flocked in and quickly dispersed to search each of the rooms in the Heaven and Earth courtyard.Su Zian and Su Bowu were also not idle; the two\u2019s gazes swept over the courtyard like lightning, afraid of missing any information.After searching the outer courtyard rooms, Su Zian followed the guards and stepped into the inner bedroom.They searched once but nothing was found.Su Zian\u2019s eyes held a complex expression. He was grateful since this matter had nothing to do with his son, but was depressed because he couldn\u2019t find any clues.But right at this moment, a guard suddenly shouted out loud: \u201cWhat is that?\u201dHis finger pointed towards under the bed. There was a faint black shadow there; it was faintly discernable under the gloomy lamp light.\u201cTake it out and let\u2019s have a look!\u201d At this time, Su Zian\u2019s expression became ashen.That guard obeyed the command and quickly laid on the ground. He stretched out his hand and pulled the thing out.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Su Zian saw the bundle of black clothing and his facial expression become as dark as the black clothing; so black that his original color could not be seen.At this time, his mind echoed with a buzzing sound, as he crumbled even faster than a lost battle would make him.He never would have thought, that this search actually found something\u2026His line of sight lowered, and he actually saw a familiar small wooden box.Suddenly, Su Zian and Su Bowu\u2019s facial expression\u2019s instantly turned pale.Because both of them recognized it; this little box was the box that the Celestial Spirit Water was stored in.But now the box was completely empty. Not even mentioning the Celestial Spirit Water, even the hidden treasure map that was tucked underneath disappeared without a trace.Su Zian\u2019s eyes fixated on Su Jingyu like a viper. In a single move, he clutched his throat and loudly shouted with anger: \u201cUnfilial son! Quickly speak, where did the Celestial Spirit Water go? Also, where is the hidden treasure map? Quickly speak!!\u201dAt this time, all the evidence and all the coincidences pointed to Su Jingyu. Even if he had a hundred mouths to argue, it was beyond his ability to deny.Su Jingyu was extremely innocent, and was also very much at a loss: \u201cFather, what are you guys talking about? What Celestial Spirit Water? What hidden treasure map?\u201d How could he recognize every word when apart, but did not understand when they were put together?\u201cYou\u2019re still pretending to be innocent in front of this daddy, speak! Where is the Celestial Spirit Water? Was it not you who drank it? Quick speak, if not, your daddy here will choke you to death!\u201d At this time, Su Zian was truly infuriated.That Celestial Spirit Water was a treasure that could promote a cultivator\u2019s rank, his old father wanted to use it to break through to the seventh step, but kept saving it. And now, it had actually been stolen by another!If his old father could break through to the seventh step rank, then their Su Manor would jump up to become Eastern Ling Empire\u2019s number one family.But right now it was gone\u2026 Everything was gone. He wasn\u2019t sure if his old father, after coming out from closed door practice, would be angry enough to spit blood.\u201cFather\u2026 I really don\u2019t know.

Only this remote small courtyard was as silent as the depths of the night.After Nangong Liuyun got rid of the people tailing him, he grinning happily as he ran off to find Su Luo.At this time, he had already changed out of the night clothes covering his body.He was dressed entirely in a fast flowing soft gorgeous robe made of golden silk. The soft golden silk robe was embroidered with fragments of gold that glittered with the luster of gems. The luxurious soft robe\u2019s hem was like a warm cloud spread out in an arc, layer upon layer, it flowed with light that restrained the shadows.The soft breeze brushed by, and the wind-borne light tassels under his jade belt willfully danced about.Both of his hands encircled in his arms. He was laid-back, confident and at ease while reclining under a very tall and straight Chinese snowball viburnum tree.April was overflowing with the beginning of spring; this great big cherry tree proudly stood upright in the courtyard. Sections of captivating red snowball viburnum flowers fluttered about. The sweet fragrance overflowed in four directions and the dense mist was mesmerizing.The him at this moment, was as handsome as the main male character walking out of a painting. His silhouette was like a sculpture from ancient Greece; sharp, and distinct. It was gentle and languid. His enchanting light smile held such devilish charm.\u201cHow was it? This king\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t that bad right?\u201d Nangong Liuyun reclined under the Chinese snowball tree. His slender hands encircled in his arms and he lightly smiled as he enchantingly stared at Su Luo.\u201cBarely passable.\u201d Su Luo sat on the stone chair in the courtyard. A pot of clear tea was placed on the stone table in front of her. Tea fragrance curled upwards and lingered into a dense mist.This time, she was dressed in a pure white bright robe with a butterfly playing on daffodils. Her jet black hair was held back with a light purple ribbon and a few silken strands of beautiful hair mischievously hung down from both shoulders, revealing a sparkling and translucent gloss. The garment lining blew by teasingly, touching the delicate beautiful skin that seemed to be made of porcelain.Facing her neither warm nor cold attitude, Nangong Liuyun not only did not mind, but instead raised his face and leaned in. He leaned in to the closest distance possible. Hot air fluttered to her ears with a deep and affectionate voice: \u201c Good girl, did you get the Celestial Spirit Water?\u201d\u201cOf course, didn\u2019t you see who set out on this campaign?\u201d Any missions Su Luo went on, never had a record of failure. Even if it was now the olden times and the difficulty had been increased numerous times, it was still not too difficult for her.She handed him the Celestial Spirit Water. The expression in her eyes seem pleased with herself, \u201cI actually thought it would be heavily guarded, but it\u2019s only like this.\u201dNangong Liuyun indulgently pampered her and used his long and smooth slim fingers to poke her forehead: \u201cKeep bragging. If not for this king having drawn away that old man, do you really think it would have been this simple?\u201d\u201cOh right, what kind of map is this? Have you seen it before?\u201d Su Luo sulkily rolled her eyes. Then, she handed that inundated yellow piece of paper to Nangong Liuyun.She had no idea what the crooked weird words on it meant.Nangong Liuyun took it and carefully looked at it.His expression originally held a hint of crooked smile, but after a quarter of an hour, his expression began to slightly change.Something that can change the expression on Prince Jin\u2019s face was presumably not a simple thing.Su Luo curiously blinked her beautiful vividly touching eyes: \u201cWhat?

A short time later, he used a little more force to rub her head: \u201cGirl what did you eat when growing up? How could you be so lucky?

Her slender fingers poked him in the arm: \u201cI\u2019m asking you a question. Quickly, speak, could it be that this is a real hidden treasure map?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s undeniably the real deal.\u201d Nangong Liuyun said with certainty, his tone seemed to lack strength; it was very clear that he still had not recovered his thoughts from the blow.\u201cThen it is really valuable?\u201d Su Luo raised her palm sized small face as her beautiful eyes reflected the flowing water\u2019s radiance.\u201cHow could the word valuable be used to describe it?\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s facial expression did not agree, \u201cThis is simply a priceless treasure. The Celestial Spirit Water can\u2019t even be mentioned on equal terms with it.\u201d\u201cIs that true or fake?\u201d Su Luo immediately become exhilarated. She doubtfully looked at her own pair of white tender hands. These hands\u2019 luck was really that godlike?\u201cHow could I lie to you? This fragment is one piece of the Secluded Necropolis of the Gods\u2019 map. Secluded Necropolis of the Gods\u2026 That is an existence which transcended endless years. Rumor has it, people coming out of there, even those considered most ordinary, can exterminate a country on this continent in one move.\u201d\u201cOne of the most ordinary of persons from there, could destroy a country in only one move?\u201d No matter how calm Su Luo was, she still cannot avoid opening wide her beautiful misty eyes.This, how could this let people live? Su Luo simply could not imagine it. Even if an extremely strong person came over, how could he annihilate a country with only one move? This is simply\u2026 unimaginable!\u201cThis is indeed what the legends say.\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s pair of beautiful eyes became deep and mysterious. He faintly said. \u201cIt has been said that there was a struggle between experts of the Secluded place many years ago. They all died in the final charge; the bodies of the extremely strong practitioners were buried in the Secluded Necropolis of the Gods.\u201dNangong Liuyun paused. A pair of beautiful abstruse eyes seriously gazed at Su Luo, \u201cIncluding all the divine artifacts they had on their person; those were also buried in the Secluded Necropolis of the Gods.\u201dDivine artifacts carried by extremely strong practitioners\u2026.Su Luo sucked in a mouthful of cold air.Let\u2019s first not speak of extremely strong people; if speaking about even one random ordinary person that came from the Secluded place, that person could annihilate this entire city\u2019s strongest experts in one move.And now, divine artifacts of extremely strong practitioners were buried there in the Secluded Necropolis of the Gods\u2026 Even thinking about it would make one\u2019s mouth water.\u201cI really want to go there and dig for treasure, ahh.\u201d Things like unearthing treasure was something she really loved to do.\u201cThat\u2019s something you have to wait for.\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s jet black eyes faintly glowed like obsidian.

At that time he thought back to the words he said today with a tearful expression\u2026 and directly said that he was the emperor of predictions.\u201cWhether someone has good luck depends on a person\u2019s character.\u201d Su Luo vaguely taunted Nangong Liuyun with those words, \u201cOh yeah, since I now have Spatial Grass and Celestial Spirit Water, then at what time will we go look for the dragon\u2019s blood?\u201dAs a result of tonight\u2019s fight between Nangong Liuyun and Su Bowu, Su Luo understood that in this world, having real strength was the way of a king.Delaying the opening of her space would delay her wood-fire dual element cultivation, which would really making things difficult for her.This kind of feeling was like being fully aware that you had a treasure mountain but did not have the key. It was really depressing.Nangong Liuyun stroked her head, his phoenix-like eyes slightly narrowed as he spoke in a slightly doting and indulgent tone: \u201cWhen do you want to go?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk after this matter settles down a little.\u201d Su Luo sighed; she seriously gave herself a difficult problem.Sunset Mountain Range was not that close; a round trip, even if it was a smooth one, would still take a month to complete.If she was to suddenly disappear now, her cheap father would switch his suspicious gaze onto her; that was anything but reassuring.Looks like she had to think of a way, to secretly disappear for a period of time.Su Luo\u2019s beautiful eyes narrowed, lost in contemplation\u2026.But Su Luo never would have thought that before she could think of a solution, there was already someone who had voluntarily delivered themselves to her door and helped her solve the problem.This person was not a stranger; it was Su Luo\u2019s third elder sister, Su Wan.On that day, Su Luo went for a walk after eating lunch.Coming back, she discovered her courtyard had been smashed into smithereens by someone. Her only maid Lu Luo was smacked until her complexion was red and swollen, and her body was beaten black and blue.And at this time, Su Wan was still there showing off her martial prowess one lash after another, whipping Lu Luo as if she was whipping a dog!\u201cStop!\u201d Su Luo\u2019s eyes narrowed as she loudly shouted.Su Wan turned her head around and saw Su Luo. She disdainfully swept her over and then used her whip to lash toward her!Su Luo clenched her hand and grabbed the tail of the whip as her eyes flashed with a hint of coldness: \u201cAre you courting death?\u201dThe corner of Su Wan\u2019s mouth revealed a mocking expression: \u201cSu Luo, a noble person should know her stuff. How can you, an ordinary person, speak like this to me? Are you thinking of courting death?\u201dSu Wan was now a first step martial artist. Although it wasn\u2019t sufficient to be near the top, she felt superior compared to the good for nothing Su Luo.Su Luo coldly smiled: \u201cThen can I ask this noble first step marital artist, your eminence coming to my small courtyard, is to get rid of anger against whom?\u201d\u201cSu Luo, you\u2019re still trying to hide it even now? Humph! That day at the lotus pond, you saw it didn\u2019t you?!\u201d Since that day, Su Wan was continuously humiliated and insulted by Su Xi; she really was unable to live through those kind of days.Later on, she accidentally learned that day Su Luo actually passed by that place from the mouth of a maid. When she recalled how sorry she looked and was seen by Su Luo, a whiff of anger could not be suppressed and belched out.But Su Wan would never think that not only had Su Luo passed by that place, she was actually the originator of the incident.If Su Wan knew, then perhaps she might even have have the heart to kill Su Luo.In front of others, Su Wan was gentle and kind, but in front of Su Luo, she would undoubtedly reveal her true nature. She was just simply too lazy to pretend!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Oh, third elder sister, are you talking about that day when you fell into the lotus pond? During that time, you rushed out, but suddenly encountering the big fire, you jumped in again. In the end, you got thrown out by someone, and as a result, embarrassed yourself in front of countless people from the aristocratic families\u2019 younger generation. Was it this matter you were referring to?\u201d\u201cYou\u2014 you really saw that,\u201d Su Wan angrily shrieked.\u201cYes, I was also looking at it freely and honestly. What\u2019s it to you? Third elder sister, since it\u2019s something you did, why would you be afraid of it being seen by others?\u201d The corner of Su Luo\u2019s mouth rose into a taunting grin. Her beautiful eyes were emitting bursts of frigid rays of light.A person\u2019s evil nature could really be frighteningly hideous, and she specialized in picking up a soft touch to pinch.When Su Xi bullied her in this way, she dared not to resist, because in Su Xi\u2019s eyes, she was just a good-for-nothing. If her heart became angry she would unleash it on Su Luo. This could only be called really \u2018intolerably bullying\u2019!But this was not the first time. In fact, this kind of stuff had occurred many times in the past!\u201cSu Luo! You deserve to die! You wretched good for nothing bitch!\u201d Everything she had experienced that day, had become pain that would be carved into Su Wan\u2019s heart for a lifetime. When she recalled what happened that day, she really want to choke Su Xi to death.Su Wan, no matter what, could not pull back her whip.When the whip drew close enough, Su Luo grabbed the whip\u2019s tail, and stressing each syllable she said, \u201cSu Wan, you are nothing but a first ranked martial artist. You are also born of a concubine, yet you always act like a stuck-up in front of me, feeling superior and harshly lording over me. A first-ranked martial artist, what\u2019s so great about that?\u201d\u201cA good for nothing like you will never understand the world of practitioners. Go die!\u201dSu Wan abandoned the whip, then with one palm, very harshly slapped toward Su Luo.Su Luo laughed coldly in her heart. She stook a step back and avoided the surprise attack. Afterwards, the whip in her hand turned over, changing directions, and very harshly whipped toward Su Wan\u2019s face.Swoosh\u2026The crisp sound of the whip resounded.This lash not only landed on Su Wan\u2019s face with ferocious strength, it even send her flying away for a few meters.At this time, Su Luo\u2019s facial expression was very cruel and ice-cold, similar to a demon from hell, that could make a person\u2019s heart tremble.Slowly her mouth arched into an ice-cold sneer. \u201cBeing an ordinary person and striking the face of a first ranked martial artist\u2026 it feels very invigorating.\u201dAt this moment, she quietly and motionlessly stood there for a long time. The wind gently raised her garment. The corner of her skirt fluttering like the dazzling cherry blossom.Su Luo\u2019s cruel and ice-cold words, when posed in such cold and threatening manner, sounded near Su Wan\u2019s ear.Su Wan, who was whipped flying, smashed very heavily into the corner of the wall. She immediately issued a miserable scream.A distinct whip mark appeared on her face. The whip mark cracked open and blood kept flowing. The wound looked horrible.Su Wan touched the wound with her hands. Her eyes were full of astonishment, but she unwaveringly stared at Su Luo, full of hatred. \u201c You\u2026.\u201dWatching Su Luo\u2019s cold eyes was like looking at a thousand-year-old cold ice; they were completely lacking in emotion. A hint of fear flashed through her heart, like a small part of a cold idea frantically initiating from the bottom jumped up.How can it be like this? Su Luo she\u2026.she is only a good-for-nothing. How could\u2026.how could she have such a cruel expression in her eyes? Her deterrent force at this time unexpectedly is stronger than even our imposing grandfather\u2019s, this, how was this possible?Su Wan\u2019s heart became bewildered and unsettled.Also at this time, Lu Luo was completely shocked.This was awe-inspiring. It made people want to revere the young lady. Her black hair was adrift from being wind-borne. Her small face may have been extremely beautiful, but it was also full of callousness and the determination to vanquish; This released an imposing manner that made people afraid to look at directly.At this moment she was dazzling like the convergence of all the sunlight.This person\u2026this person is really the mistress? She really served this person from childhood to adult? Is she really that idiot mistress that allowed others to bully her?\u201cWhat\u2019s so great about a first ranked martial artist, if she was still whipped flying by this good-for-nothing? So, over the years, what were you so proud off?\u201d Su Luo crouched down, eyes full of arrogance; while speaking she was playing with the whip and mercilessly mocking Su Wan.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Obviously you have been hit, but to still continue to ask,\u2019you actually hit me?\u2019\u201dSuch a brazen insult, caused Su Wan\u2019s lungs to almost explode from anger. Her face trembled, and stressing each syllable through gritted teeth, she said: \u201c You\u2013court\u2013death! \u201c\u201cThe one courting death is you!\u201d Su Luo took out the whip, and mercilessly whipped her body, lash by lash. Her eyes were shining with a brilliant light that could leave a person in a state of terror. \u201cThis whiplash is for the previous Su Luo! This whip is lashed for Lu Luo! This whip is lashed for the ants that were crushed to death by you\u2026.\u201dSu Luo\u2019s justifications was full of fantastic oddities of every description, but she could always find a reason to whip Su Wan. It\u2019s like at a wine table, people will always find a justification to force the other to drink until they become drunk.In almost no time, Su Wan\u2019s body was covered with lash marks; her clothes had become ragged, worse than a beggar\u2019s.\u201cSu Luo! I will never let you off! Absolutely never!\u201d Su Wan crawled up. While hugging her exposed body, she urgently began to take steps to run out.As she made her way, she staggered along. She fell down and then crawled up, crawled up and then fell down. She looked like a very sorry figure.Watching Su Wan\u2019s figure from the back as she ran away, Su Luo\u2019s pupils manifested a sneaky, crafty grin.\u201c Miss, this, this is not good right?\u201d Before, Su Luo would always act in the role of the bullied. Today however, it\u2019s reversed, with her whipping another. Lu Luo was not used to this type of change, so it was also a little terrifying.\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about it? Bullying others is always better than being bullied.\u201d Su Luo sat at the stone table set in the courtyard. And with a calm manner, unruffled in the midst of chaos, she poured herself a cup of tea.\u201c But, but this\u2026\u201d Lu Luo stammered as she said, \u201cThe third miss left to tattle to the master. What can we do?\u201dWasn\u2019t the mistress afraid of the master before? In front of him, she would always be a yes-man, almost unable to speak a complete sentence; now however, it seem as if she is not even a little afraid?\u201cMy cheap father, right now, won\u2019t be in a relaxed enough frame of mind to deal with other people\u2019s business. He has something keeping him busy at the moment.\u201d This matter was also something Su Luo found for him.Besides, her father may be cheap and old, but he was also not stupid. In this world where the strong were respected, Su Wan was a first rank martial artist who couldn\u2019t even beat an ordinary person. Under these circumstances, what\u2019s the use of supporting this daughter? Wouldn\u2019t it just be a waste?Her cheap,old father can calculate very well in regards to this matter. It was really unnecessary for her to worry about anything.Sure enough, Su Wan, while covering her face full of whip wounds and weeping endlessly, ran to find the great Su general Su Zian. However, she encountered being given the cold shoulder that she had previously never before experienced.Su Zian impatiently suppressed his temper and listened to Su Wan\u2019s tale of receiving unjust treatment. He exhaustedly rubbed between his eyebrows to relieve the stress, but, in the end, he was unable to tolerate any more; he settled it straightforwardly with one sentence, \u201c You are a first rank martial artist and unable to defeat a good for nothing, yet you still have the face to come here to cry?\u2019Su Wan was suddenly startled. She raised her small, crying face like the rain bearing pear blossoms. Face full of disbelief, she stuttered, \u201c Father\u2026.but this\u2026..but this\u2026.she hit me\u2026.\u201dSu Zian was busy trying to catch the thief that stole the hidden treasure map, so how could he have the frame of mind to manage a struggle between daughters of the family, \u201cOkay, all right, Su Luo was really wrong in this matter, but you are wrong too. If there was no business, what were you doing in her courtyard?\u201d\u201cZi Wu!\u201d Su Zian wearing a cold expression, thundered out a command.From outside of the door a guard came in.

His gaze landed upon Su Wan\u2019s face and a flash of astonishment shone from his eyes. Afterwards, with some disgust, he turned his face away and finally left following the command.Isn\u2019t it merely solitary confinement? To let her go this lightly? This is absolutely inconceivable!Su Wan was so angry that she almost cried. She shouted and crawled toward Su Zian and was even about to hug his thigh.It was a pity that her face was smeared with blood coupled with tears, sweat, body clothed in rags. And when she had rolled around the floor before, it had become truly filthy. Her entire being looked no different from that of a malicious spirit.Su Zian\u2019s eyes flashed with loathing.This daughter is also a useless tool!Only knowing how to stir up trouble, but never thinking of a way to help lessen his burdens!A touch of anger flashed across Su Zian\u2019s heart as he recalled that, just a few days ago, this was the very same Su Wan who had heavily lost face in front of the crown prince.Although everyone outside said it was Su Luo, but as for the actual truth, as a father, how could he not know?Su Zian turned his back on her by withdrawing his thigh and in a cold voice said. \u201cYou will also go back and stay in your yard for three month, carefully reflect upon yourself, study well from your fifth younger sister\u2019s example!\u201dIsn\u2019t this locking her in confinement? Su Wan\u2019s expression was full of unwillingness and discontent.And to also learn from Su Xi example? In this Su Manor, the most arrogant and willful person who still took rash actions, isn\u2019t it actually Su Xi? Su Wan was so despondent that she almost spit out blood.\u201cDaddy\u2026\u201d Su Wan still desired to beseech him while weeping.But Su Zian waved his hand. In a cold, furious voice, he said, \u201c Zi Xi! Drag the third Miss back to her courtyard and carefully watch her!\u201dEach and everyone of them won\u2019t save me from worrying! Su Zian\u2019s fist heavily smashed towards the table made from pear-tree wood. Immediately the deep imprint of a fist appeared on the table.The veins on Su Zian\u2019s forehead were beating, like his heart was jumping around.Father is about to come out of closed-door practice, but the Celestial Spirit Water has completely disappeared; and also that piece of hidden treasure map. Where exactly could it be?!Jingyu, that stinking brat. He won\u2019t confess even facing death, and from his mouth Su Zian was unable to obtain any useful information.Su Zian was so vexed that his full head of black hair was almost all pulled out.A thief in the family is really hard to guard against. It was a pity that Su Zian did not know, this thief from the family was not Su Jingyu, but was in fact the one whom he firmly believe to be a good-for-nothing fourth daughter.Su Zi Wu with his cold, dark face walked into the courtyard and passed on the Su generals commands.Su Luo sweetly and obediently demonstrated that she would properly stay in her courtyard to contemplate. Everyday she would appear to properly think things over, and learn from her fifth sister Su Xi.Su Zi Wu slammed the door shut, then heavy locks were used to keep the door sealed.Afterwards, even delivering her meal would be done by passing it over the wall.\u201cMiss\u2026 this\u2026 \u201cIsn\u2019t this punishment a little light? If it was the way it was in the past, the master would have definitely made people whip the mistress.\u201cI told you earlier, you don\u2019t need to worry alright?\u201d Su Luo gave off an appearance of a prophet with supernatural accuracy. She comfortably lay down on the soft couch, eating dessert in one hand and flipping through the book of the history of the continent in the other hand.These days, Su Luo had flipped through all the books on the history of the continent, she also read some books about herbs.After all, in the future her cultivation would have to include apothecary skills. Moreover she would soon enter Sunset Mountain Range. Based on the luck of her hands, she felt she would have extraordinary opportunities.Lu Luo whose face was full of happiness took care of Su Luo. \u201cMiss, these next few days we need to properly stay in the courtyard, so do not stir up trouble, okay?\u201dThis time her father had given her a rather light punishment, though it was not known why. The next time, surely, it would not be so simple.Who knew that Su Luo would toss the book into Lu Luo\u2019s lap. With a gaze that was all smiles, she said to her \u201c This Miss officially informs you, Lu Luo girl, these three months, you will have a good stay in this courtyard and reflect in place of your mistress.

In a blink of an eye, it had arrived.The gorgeous, extravagant carriage had the curtains surrounding it were cut from real silk and inlaid with an obscure red plum blossoms embroidery.The carriage was made from pear tree wood, and it\u2019s two walls were engraved with golden flowers. The gilding was inlaid with jade that were formed into, exquisite carvings along with other cut gems. From the top of the carriage rows of pink tassels, that surrounded the gig, dangled and spun around in the wind creating a gorgeous atmosphereWhat made more people turn around was the white horse.This was not just any insignificant, ordinary horse.If one looked closely, it could be seen that his body was covered in greenish-blue scales, yet its body was still like that of a horse. It looked like an unusual divine spirit horse. Furthermore it\u2019s running speed was faster than a Thousand Li Blood-Perspiring Treasure-Horse* by several folds.Almost in a blink of an eye, it stood quietly not moving in front of Su Luo.The greenish-blue scales on its body gleamed. Nodding its head and shaking its tail, the horse raised both hooves and whinned toward the sky, giving off the appearance of a true divine spirit horse.\u201cCould this be a Dragon Scaled Horse?\u201d Su Luo exclaimed in surprise.These days she had been focused on studying the history and general knowledge of this continent, so she currently had some knowledge about common species.\u201cHow could it not be?\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s indulgent, devilish, charmingly-low voice carried a hint of laughter.His sedan chair was obscured by a curtain of jade beads, but she could faintly see Nangong Liuyun gracefully reclined on the soft cushion inside the horse carriage. She could see that he was dressed entirely in a gorgeously flowing, soft robe made of golden silk threads It\u2019s hem was curved like a warm cloud, twisting and turning, draped across the edge of the soft couch with layers folded upon layers. Even the flowing light dispelled all of the shadows and created a pretty flirtatious and compelling atmosphere.Even for a moment, Su Luo found it hard to believe her own eyes.According to her knowledge, the Dragon Scaled Horse was a type of demon beast, with extraordinary strength. Even the most ordinary, run of the mill Dragon Scaled Horse\u2019s strength was equivalent to a person of fifth ranked martial artist.What kind of strength was someone of a fifth rank? Take for example, Su Xi. This little genius was still only at the second rank. Su Jingyu is merely at the third rank, and, as for the grand general that protects the country, Su Zian, he had not even passed the fifth rank.Just with this single small Dragon Scaled Horse, one could be compared to an important general that protects the country. Among all the powerful people, only Nangong Liuyun had this horse in the entire Eastern Ling Empire! Nobody else had one, ah.Not only that, he did not raise this Dragon Scaled Horse as a battle companion but instead used it as he wished to draw a carriage.Its use was extremely extravagant. He was indeed deserving of being called his legendary highness, Prince Jin.\u201cCome here.\u201d Nangong Liuyun beckoned with his slender, pale-white fingers from within the carriage. a hypnotic smile as intoxicating as blooming cherry blossoms in March, appeared on his face.His words were unhurried and careless but held a kind of strength that couldn\u2019t be ignored.Su Luo, who wanted to test the speed of a Dragon Scaled Horse, voluntarily lifted the jade bead curtain and sat inside.Compared to the carriage\u2019s gorgeous extravagant exterior, the interior space was much more delicate, beautifully detailed, and refined.The interior wall was inlaid with all kinds of gemstones:, amber, pearl, and high quality crystals that were priceless and unique. These gems emitted a faint luster, which generated the excess light that sweep away the haze and blur of any shadows.\u201c Such an extravagant carriage room. You must have milked many people dry of their blood, sweat and tears. Am I right?\u201d Su Luo while admiring the luxurious carriage interior, clicked her tongue in wonder.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s face was like the full moon of Mid-Autumn , pure white and sleekly smooth, were accentuated by a pair of beautiful eyes like resplendent obsidian jade. He muffled a light laugh, \u201c what about it? Are you going to play the part of the righteous heroine that comes to the aid of those suffering injustice?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have that much spare time.\u201d Su Luo waved her hands. She sat and, doing as she pleased, picked up the white jade teapot and gracefully poured herself a cup of fragrant tea. As she finished pouring she gave praise, \u201cas expected of his highness, Prince Jin. you really know how to live life to the fullest.

She wanted to resist, but she soon discovered that she was helpless in his grasp.Suddenly\u2026.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s palms appeared on the back of her head, locked itself there, and heavily seized her petal-soft lips.His tongue was hot and soft, but also seemed to contain a formidable strength. It sharply entered to explore the inside of her mouth and closely chased after her tongue.Earnest yet persistent.He closed his black as ink eyes and stood fast, as he evenly drank in her sweet flavor.Since the beginning, she had been resisting. Even under such overwhelming assault, she still passionately resisted.But he secured her hands behind her back. The back of her head was once again powerfully in his grasp, and her entire body become weak and limp, unable to move a single step.This kiss was full of burning lust and strongly felt of honeyed desires.Perhaps it was due to a body\u2019s instinctive chemical response; or maybe it was because of his superb skill. Whatever the cause, slowly, her stiff body started to soften, and steadily began to harmonize with Nangong Liuyun\u2019s forceful, wantonly plundering kiss.Currently, Su Luo\u2019s brain activity had flat lined.The past betrayal she experienced in the other world\u2026 the pain that tore her heart and split her lungs\u2026she couldn\u2019t think of anything. All rational thoughts had fled, and her body slavishly listened to the commanding kiss and feedback this signal to her brain.After what seemed like an eternity\u2026.. their lips parted. The corner of his mouth held a sliver of white, silken thread. Giving off a coarse and wildly erotic appearance.All along, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s vision was locked onto Su Lu. It was hard to read anything from the midst of his beautiful eyes. However, they seemed to still hold remnants of passion.Su Luo\u2019s fair and delicate face, without any warning, had become red.Her subconscious mind wanted to push him away. Nangong Liuyun, however, suddenly gave off a wicked laugh.Once again, his lips, like swan feathers, gently played across her cheeks, her earlobes, her eyes\u2026.Both of Nangong Liuyun\u2019s lips resembled a blazing ball of fire,wantonly setting everywhere aflame. Where ever he kissed, a fervent blaze, that could scorch anything it touched, would spread there.Su Luo\u2019s temperature increased little by little until it finally engulfed her entire body. Su Luo suddenly felt as if she had been set on fire\u2026..Memories from her previous life came back thick and fast. On top of the cliff, that impossibly hard to forget sense of betrayal rushed forth like the tide\u2026.A sense of panic suddenly flashed across Su Luo\u2019s heart. Subconsciously, she abruptly used all her strength to push Nangong Liuyun away\u2014-Nangong Liuyun, who was immersed in the passion and desire, was completely taken aback. He did not expect Su Luo would take such an action, so, without the slightest bit of guard, he heavily fell backwards\u2026.\u201cBang\u2026.\u201d a loud sound echoed, as the back of Nangong Liuyun\u2019s head knocked against the hard interior wall, producing an echoing sound that was sharp and clear.The surrounding area become very quiet all of a sudden. The air was saturated with a feeling of awkwardness.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s expression was covered with haze, like tranquility before a tempest. His pair of eyes, black and deep as ink, seemed cold and overcast with a somewhat scary, deadly look. These eyes locked onto Su Luo, and his handsome appearance condensed into a thick layer of frost.Su Luo was dumbfounded. She unconsciously covered her red lips, wanting to laugh but afraid to laugh. Within her there was not only embarrassment but also a thread of regretHow could she have known that this strong and overbearing man was so frail, with one push he would fall?\u201cThat uhmm\u2026.Are you okay?\u201dSu Luo saw him firmly glaring at her. He seemed to want to stare until he reached the bottom of her heart. This made her become apprehensive. She could only feebly stand by her question.Her response was Nangong Liuyun\u2019s silence and that pair of cold black and fierce eyes.Su Luo slowly moved closer to him, and somewhat awkwardly, scratched her head. She even shook his sleeves with a hint of embarrassment. Being at a loss, she continued to ask, \u201c\u2026.Does it hurt?\u201dIt should have been very painful, right? Just now, the sound from the impact was so severe that it could scare people.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s deep dark eyes were cold and remote, and moodily measuring and watching her he replied. \u201cWant to give it a try?\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She couldn\u2019t help but think it was ridiculous. She slid a few steps back to be far from where he sat.\u201cCome here\u2014\u2014,\u201d said Nangong Liuyun with one hand supporting the back of his head. The other lush and jade-like hand beckoned towards Su Luo.But the gaze he fixed upon Su Luo was with his deep enchanting and boundless pupils. His light, phoenix-like gaze narrowed. It seemed to hold a touch of laughter inside of it. From its disappearing, beautiful nature their hidden depth revealed an insufferably arrogant and noble haughtiness.That effortlessness exuded the highest quality of a tyrannical king. It was a gaze that, just by seeing it, people would find it hard to defy such elegance and charm that resemble nature itself.Su Luo perceptively shook her head.She was not a fool. If she went over now, then wasn\u2019t it voluntarily delivering herself to his door for him to ravage? Of course she didn\u2019t want that!However, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s beautiful, elegantly thin, rosy-pink, lips started to rise His mouth suddenly issued out a whistling sound. It was a crisp whistle that was loud and resounding.Suddenly, the Dragon Scaled Horse galloping at lighting speed, by scattering open its four hoofs, abruptly raised up both front hoofs. It followed up with a mighty whine.However because of the stop, the horse carriage suddenly began to twist, and, not in the least bit on-guard, Su Luo got violently thrown back\u2014\u2014Without the time to react, she had again fallen back into Nangong Liuyun\u2019s embrace.Before she could sit back up, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s slender, powerful hands dared to clamp like steel around Su Luo\u2019s wrist. His enchanting and devilishly sly lips turned upwards, carrying a trace of arrogance and haute.His pair of dark, obsidian-like eyes, shone luminously and firmly locked onto Su Luo\u2019s face. The corner of his mouth raised into a wicked laugh. Such a laugh made Su Luo somewhat scared within the depths of her heart.\u201cYou, what are you doing!\u201d Su Luo unconsciously hugged her plump, well-endowed bosoms. Her stammering tone betrayed her guilty conscience.\u201cYou said you won\u2019t come over. Yet didn\u2019t you just take the initiative to deliver yourself into my arms?\u201d His eyes contained an evil and stern smiling expression.\u201cObviously this is due to the fact that you cheated!\u201d Su Luo bitterly threw him a glance.He and his Dragon Scaled Horse had conspired to set her up . So instead of distancing herself, she could have been said to have thrown herself into his arms. It really was truly preposterous!\u201cSo what?\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s smile was really infuriating His eyes turned into peach blossom as they started to shine brightly, \u201cIf you have the ability you can also go and catch such a horse. Ah, but right now you should be compensating this king for his time.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Su Luo felt she was extremely unlucky at this point.Nangong Liuyun supported his forehead with one hand, and allowed his soft fine black hair to flow down swiftly. He really did carry such a devilish charm that despite acting wild and rash, it was making him out to be the ultimate lure.He unhurriedly spoke with a deep and alluring voice. His beautiful, dark eyes resembled a sinister pit of darkness and profoundly mysterious that did not allow people to see into his thoughts.\u201cHow about serving this king.\u201d The corner of Nangong Liuyun\u2019s dark eyebrows raised slightly. As he glanced around: inside of his eyes flashed prettily and flirtatiously, with a touching smile.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s pair of snow-white hands gracefully swirled the wine cup made of jade celadon. While taking a light sip from time to time, his appearance was happy and content.\u201cHow do you want to be served?\u201d Su Luo expressed that she completely did not know.Nangong Liuyun with a joyful expression shot her a quick glance. His entire body leaned on top of the soft cushion, giving off an lazy impression. From his long and narrow elegant almond-shaped eyes emerges a smiling expression. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dSu Luo thought about it, picked up the white jade wine jar, artfully poured a cup of wine, and handed it to Nangong Liuyun. \u201cOnce you drink this cup of wine, with one stroke we\u2019ll write off what happened in the past! Come, let\u2019s drink.\u201dNangong Liuyun, unable to take his eyes off Su Luo, used his beautiful eyes suspiciously to size her up. Suddenly, his mouth formed into an extremely charming, devilish smile, and using Su Luo\u2019s hands , his red lips inhaled the amber colored grape wine in one mouthful.But, his pair of gloomy deep eyes were always burningly fixed on Su Luo.The corner of his mouth was perfectly curved, and a scarlet drop of wine rolled down it. This gave off a pretty and flirtatious charm but also cold and blood-thirsty.Being watched attentively by such a wild and coarse wolf-like stare, Su Luo\u2019s heart secretly shouted to herself, \u201cnot good!\u201d She turned around wishing to retreat, but who would have known that Nangong Liuyun already single-handedly clasped onto the back of her head, immobilizing her body. After that, a dense shadow came to envelope her.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They firmly imprisoned Su Luo, and under their command she was unable to budge\u201cLet go\u2026.wuhhh\u2026.,\u201dSu Luo just opened her mouth when a full-bodied strong alcoholic drink was forcefully poured into her mouth.The bright-red grape wine was following the corner of her mouth, and drop by drop, it tumbled down.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s appearance, from head to toe, emitted a majestic and imposing manner. No matter how much force Su Luo employed, he still had not moved a whisker\u2019s width.Su Luo\u2019s struggle in front of him was as negligible as dust.The feverish kiss was earth-shattering strong and overbearing.Su Luo\u2019s mind became an area of blank space, and in a split second, she almost lost herself.Forcing Su Luo to swallow that mouthful of red wine, Nangong Liuyun intimately closed in. He tenderly touched the edge of her lips and wandered there, lingering.The soft kiss was as if a feather was caressing along her mouth.The tip of his tongue\u2019s scorching heat burned her, and removed any resistance to the red-colored drops of wine at the corner of her from mouth being sucked clean.Both of their extremely beautiful faces were almost within reach; close enough to feel one another\u2019s scorching, hot breath.All around them, there was nothing but quiet and silence.The only thing that could be heard was the Dragon Scaled Horse\u2019s rapidly running gallup that gave rise to a biting, cold sound of the wind.Nangong Liuyun tenderly cupped the palm sized small face in front of his eyes, scrutinizing every delicate detail, with his obsidian eyes radiating a fascinated expression while leaving behind a strong sense of passion.This kind of passion and intimacy made Su Luo feel very uncomfortable. It made her involuntarily think about the betrayal in her previous incarnation.Su Luo clearly and coldly turned her head, suppressing the severe waves of nausea in the pit of her stomach. Little by little she adjusted to the extreme ****Nangong Liuyun, however, did not let her go. A pale, moist finger detained her bright, clean, and tapered lower jaw. His voice carried unprecedented seriousness, stressing each syllable to asked, \u201c Am I that loathsome?\u201dHis gaze from the beginning was firmly locked upon her face. As a result, he couldn\u2019t have missed the disgust that flitted around inside of her eyes and her feeling of distress, just a moment ago.Abruptly the mood dropped until it had reached the freezing point.Su Luo slowly pushed him away. Her gaze went through the window curtains that had been tossed aside\u2026Looking towards the distant and remote sky.\u201cI\u2019ll ask again, am I really that loathsome,\u201d Nangong Liuyun asked persistently from behind her back.Was he loathsome? Su Luo asked herself honestly. Ever since waking up in this world, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s assistance toward her has been an undoubtedly enormous boon.. Although he sometimes liked to \u2018raise and lower his hand\u2019*, towards her, there was never any malice.But, how could she tell him about that matter from her previously life.That matter, that person, she really doesn\u2019t want to mention it.A trace of sadness, difficult to perceive, emerged from Su Luo\u2019s dimly lit eyes as she said, \u201cMy broken heart has nothing to do with you, so don\u2019t ask anymore.\u201dShe did not expect that this sentence would act like a fuse, as all of a sudden, it had ignited Nangong Liuyun\u2019s fury.He pulled Su Luo in one grasp, an action that was rude and unreasonable, seized her chin, and let her look at him face to face. He very fiercely interrogated, \u201cIf your broken heart had nothing to do with me, then who was it related to?\u201dA moment ago, as the sadness that flited by her eyes, he seemed to understand but also not understand. But what he was confident of was, that those words to Nangong Liuyun, definitely was not a good thing.Su Luo\u2019s certainty and air of arrogance was aroused. Her stare obstinately forged ahead, \u201cNangong Liuyun, who are you to me? Isn\u2019t your control rather too wide?\u201dNangong Liuyun smiled instead of being angry. a pair of beautiful, star-like eyes were cold as ice. As he resumed detaining her lower jaw, he stressed each syllable, making a vow. \u201c You are this king\u2019s wife. This point will never change!\u201d\u201cDid I agree to this?\u201d Su Luo\u2019s thin eyebrows had been incited, and her eyes held a shallow, mocking smile.Su Luo\u2019s long hair fluttered in the wind. Her face faintly smiled. Her meaningful glance lacked both stormy waves and swelling water. Neither joyful nor sad, the depths of her eyes hid a horrifying expression.Nangong Liuyun stared blankly, as he became stumped for words. After just a moment, a mysteriously cold look emerged from its serene and hidden depth. A resplendently light smile appeared from a pair of brilliant red fulsome lips, which emitted a gem like luster. The corner of his mouth hooked up into devilish flattery. He emphatically and self-confidently said, \u201cYou, Su Luo this lifetime must be mine, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s wife!\u201dA pair of glittering obsidian eyes, flashed an expression. That disdainfully look at all living things, revealed a regality, insufferable arrogance and overbearing haughtiness.\u201cLet\u2019s wait and see.

The entire way it traveled at lightning speed, so what originally would have been a ten day journey, unexpectedly ended when they arrived within two days instead.The Sunset Mountain Range was the Eastern Ling Empire\u2019s largest forest containing magical beasts. It was located in the northwest part of Eastern Ling Empire, and covered an area approximately as large as the size of a province.Inside the forest, trees have undergone countless years of nourishment. These ancient trees were not only lush and flourishing, they also reached high into the sky. The magical beasts roamed this land, without fear, and people without martial art skills would not dare to enter inside.But the Sunset Mountain Range\u2019s arteries were not completely devoid of life. Inevitably there were martial artists who went inside. Perhaps to learn through experience and cultivate, or maybe even to hunt magical beast or to forage for medicinal herbs.The extravagantly gorgeous horse carriage slowly came to a halt. Stopping at a small village on the northern edge of the Sunset Mountain Range called Bridgehead village.Normally people who wanted to enter the Sunset Mountain Range would rest for a night in Bridgehead village. Here they could replenish and prepare the supplies necessary to enter Sunset Mountain Range.\u201cEat more green vegetables, because once we go in, there will only be roasted meat .\u201d In a private room, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s chopstick picked up slices of chicken and placed it in Su Luo\u2019s bowl. Inside his eyes, they were nearly overflowing with a dazzling smile.The argument from two days ago, as far as he was concerned, already seemed like a puff of wind. Once it had been blown then it was gone like a puff of smoke. After the events of that day, he quickly returned to acting the way he was before, scheming about the hunting trip, such that Su Luo could not lift her face.Su Luo glanced at him and said, \u201c you should also eat.\u201d\u201cIf you get it for me, then I will eat it.\u201d Nangong Liuyun leaned close to her, with a shameless smile on his face.However in that very moment, a noisy scuffling sound came through from the outside. Among the noise was also accompanied along with the yells and cryings of a little girl, who seem to have lost her head out of fear.Su Luo looked down from the open window.At that time a dispute was breaking out on the first floor lobby.One could only see a thirteen to fourteen year old girl really crying miserably. And at her side, her white-bearded grandfather had just been grabbed by the collar and hoisted high into the air.\u201cYou guys let go of my grandpa. You guys quickly release my grandpa. Grandpa will quickly be strangled to death by you guys\u2026waaaa\u2026.\u201d The little girl was crying so hard that she almost was unable to breath.Yet the person choking her old grandpa was a wealthy young noble. Though his entire body clothed in splendid brocade garment, it was a pity he had been born a sharp beak and monkey cheeks on his face.He dragged on the final sound of a syllable, and leisurely sneered. With a face that held a very ferocious appearance, \u201cDead old man, you see clearly right? Our plate of food has a fly in it. Come now, tell me, how will you deal with this?\u201dThat elderly man being strangled was already around 70 to 80 years old. His hair white as frost, and he had a face full of wrinkles. With his eyelids drooping, his answer did not come quickly.Misery filling his eyes, he trembled, swayed, while he entreated the man, \u201c My lords, our inn is always clean, how could we have flies? This\u2026this surely was a mistake somewhere.\u201d\u201c A mistake? Is this not a fly? Speak you! How are you going to deal with this?\u201d That wealthy young noble, with one foot on top of the bench was still grasping the old man\u2019s collar with one hand.Behind him was a row of hired thugs, each and every one of them with a dragon\u2019s vitality and a tiger\u2019s ferociousness. Their gazes opened wide as a circle. They were extremely formidable. So much so that they gave off a powerfully deterring aura.\u201cThese dishes\u2026.just regard it as this little old man\u2019s gifts to all of you, free of charge. What do you think?\u201d The old man\u2019s face had an unspeakable sadness.\u201cGifted to me free of charge? What do you mean? Is this not acting as if we are freeloading?\u201d That wealthy young noble was very dissatisfied. \u201cYou see clearly it\u2019s your house\u2019s dish that has a fly! Ah, See? Did you see it?\u201dHe lifted the elderly man\u2019s head and pressed it down onto the table, almost burying his entire face into the dish full of food.Misery filling the elder man\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes, yes, yes, you lords say how it should be handled, and it will be done in that way\u2026\u201dThe frequent sound of the wealthy young noble\u2019s cold laughter could be heard as it resounded. \u201cYou know, this is not because we deliberately extorted you. It\u2019s because your food had a problem. So, upon seeing that you provide 50 tael* of silver, then this matter will end from this point on.\u201d\u201c50 taels?\u201d An expression of such shock flashed across the elderly man\u2019s entire face that it was almost hard to believe.*1 tael = 50 grams (very heavy)\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Can\u2019t pay out for that amount?\u201d The wealthy young noble laughed maliciously while casting sidelong glances at the old man.The elderly man grimaced in response.\u201d Young master Zhao, I beseech you. Please be magnanimous ah\u2026 Even if you were to sell both grandparent and grandchild, I still wouldn\u2019t have 50 taels.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t have it? Hey, hey.\u201d That young master Zhao began to make a groping motion towards the girl\u2019s face, \u201cThis girl looks pretty good. White and tender soft. Hmmm\u2026 after growing up a little more she will probably be an incredible beauty. Well, since this is the case, then just let this girl stand in for the 50 tael. Seeing that you are so poor, we\u2019ll just let it pass and take a little loss.\u201dYoung master Zhao was clearly taking convenient advantage of the situation, and yet, in speech, he still tried to flaunt how well-behaved he was. He nauseatingly emphasized his own charitable kindness.Su Luo\u2019s gaze become cold. Seeing the elderly man\u2019s expression and the surrounding people\u2019s reactions, this young master Zhao must be the number-one, local tyrant. There must have been a frighteningly powerful man behind him.Su Luo\u2019s thin eyebrows wrinkled. However she did not plan to take action and come to their aid at this time.At this moment, from the corner of the lobby, a loud shout suddenly rang out. The sound of a lovable voice seemed to arise throughout the floor.\u201cYou guys are these shameless and disrespectful to the elderly. All you do is specialize in bullying and humiliating the small and weak. Forcefully snatching woman from ordinary families. You are all truly extremely vile!\u201d In the wake of the young master\u2019s exploits, the voice barley just dropped in like a splash of cold water. A slender silhouette stood up from its seat and came out. A young lady, in the prime of her youth, was holding the shaft of a flexible double-edged sword in her hand. The sword blade glittered like frost and snow, issuing cold, austere energy.This young lady was about fifteen to sixteen years old. Her upper body covered in blue with green jade and a smoky colored jacket with open slits. The bottom was a light-blue, pleated skirt patterned with flowery water and mist.The skin on her small face was like a clear, crystalized amber. The snow-white complexion revealed a trace of pink still carrying a little baby fat. It was offset by a pair of a large, pea-sized dimples, a refreshingly clean look that was capable of charming any person it was directed at.On the table behind her, sat five to six young men and young ladies of the same age. They gave off an image of an organized group from a school that was sent out to learn from experience.Moreover, Su Luo felt that the young lady in front of her eyes seemed a bit familiar. Her surname should be Liu.She appeared to have played very well with Su Xi. Before with Su Xi she had even acted jointly to cause her harm.Su Luo, with one hand supporting her chin, was full of interest, as she watched the development of the play below. She actually didn\u2019t expect that Miss Liu, with the same character as Su Xi, could be so willing to perform such a good show as to save a person.This, after all\u2026what reason could there be for this?Young master Zhao stroking his lower jaw and full of interest, began sizing up the young lady in front of his eyes. \u201cOi, little beauty, are you demanding to throw yourself into my arms?\u201d\u201cShameless!\u201d Miss Liu shouted, and with one thrust of her long double-edged sword she whooshed over.Miss Liu gracefully displayed her long, double-edged sword dance naturally, causing it to glitter like frost and snow. The sword thrusts appeared like blooming flowers in all directions with a vigorous and strength-born presence. This aura seemed to be teeming with the desire to kill.Young master Zhao\u2019s originally teasing expression very quickly became motionless. A serious expression began to appear on his face. The two people intertwined to fight, unable to distinguish who\u2019s better.Even though downstairs was bustling with noise and excitement, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s gaze had, since the beginning, always been locked onto Su Luo. Smiling and tweeting like he was singing a song, \u201cYou see? now the limelight was snatched by someone else.\u201dHe could see Su Luo\u2019s sympathy towards that granddaughter, and this was the reason why his comment carried a teasing air to it.\u201cNangong Liuyun, in your eyes, am I just an idiot?\u201d Su Luo exasperatedly rolled her eyes.\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s pair of bright, resplendent diamond-like eyes were fixed on Su Luo.\u201cThat young master Zhao\u2026 With one look you could already determine that he was the local gang leader. That Miss Liu may be able to save them once, but what about a second time or a third time? She can not protect them, once she leaves. So, when she does leave, those thugs will bring more people to tear down this restaurant. This is not called rescuing people but to bring them more harm.Su Luo\u2019s beautiful eyes roamed around, with an indifferent expression, the corner of her mouth hooked into a distinct cold arc, like the splendidly gorgeous firework fading faintly into nothingness.Pausing a bit, she once again sneered. \u201cBesides, even more so, when looking at her current status; it would be pretty good, if she end up not inviting more trouble for that pair of kinsfolk.Nangong Liuyun humorously watched Su Luo, and an expression full of appreciation flashed across the depth of his eyes.His Luo girl definitely does not know that her manner of speaking, frankly and with assurance, was so radiant it illuminated her entire persons with a colorfully splendid light.Also only with such a clever mind as hers, could at the moment of rescuing someone, thoughtfully consider the entire situation. Only then will a person truly succeed in helping another in solving their trouble, rather than bring about a more difficult problem.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her other hand successfully completed the motion of drawing an arc in the air, and together a rain of arrows, hiding the sky and covering the earth, attacked toward the body of young master Zhao.Quite clearly, this Miss Liu was not only a martial artist but also a water element mage.Due to the nature of the intense close-quarters combat, young master Zhao still hadn\u2019t set up any defenses. An ominous woosh of the wind sounded, as no less than seven water arrows, similar to sharp swords, pierced every part of young master Zhao\u2019s body.Young master Zhao had an incredulous expression on his face. When he had toppled to the ground, he died while refusing to close his eyes*.Miss Liu joyfully threw a glance in the direction of the second floor, and afterwards with a conceited manner, she walked away and returned to her team members.\u201cYoung master!\u201dThe row of bodyguards behind young master Zhao had just seen their own young master killed, so each and everyone of their eyes were bloodshot from rage. Baring their teeth, they truly wished to split in their enemy\u2019s eyes and pop their veins until it exploded with their own two hands.All of them did not give any regards to their lives and threw themselves toward the young Miss Liu. Having pledged with their lives to eviscerate her with their machetes, they attacked with the hope of avenge their own young master!However, the schoolmates in Miss Liu\u2019s company were not vegetables. They were all brilliant students from the best Imperial Mage school. They could all hold the title of legendary geniuses.Consequently, a battle royal was about to unfold .The restaurant\u2019s owner, was that pair of grandfather and grandchild. Their eyes were full of alarm mixed with despair, when they saw young master Zhao go down.At this time, the restaurant\u2019s door had already been closed by someone. When the patrons in the lobby saw the situation was going to run amok, at any second; as fast as they could, each and everyone of them run upstairs.They all gathered at the entrance of the staircase on the second floor. Those few who knew about young master Zhao\u2019s background, felt they had really encountered calamity and expressed mutual faces of those who were truly out of luck.But not everyone knew about young master Zhao\u2019s background, so among them, one piped up and asked.A middle-aged fellow\u2019s face, who knew the truth about young master Zhao, forced out a bitter laugh. \u201cBecause of this situation, we can only be considered to have thoroughly encountered bad luck. You outsiders wouldn\u2019t know. Young master Zhao was the local provincial governing official\u2019s son. His only son. We never thought he would die this way.\u201dA person interrupted saying, \u201c his merely a senior provincial official\u2019s son. What\u2019s so amazing about that?\u201dIn Eastern Ling Empire, if all of the senior provincial officers were added together one would find there were no fewer than 20 or 30 of them.The middle-aged fellow continued to laugh bitterly. \u201cThis place is a small town on the edge of an artery of Sunset Mountain Range. Someone who is the senior provincial officer here, how could he be an ordinary useless official, who would normally only be fit for gorging and boozing? This honorable senior provincial official\u2019s martial art ability is deep and unmeasurable. It\u2019s said that he is at least above the fifth step! \u201d\u201cFifth step\u2026.\u201dThe bystanders immediately become mutes.Fifth step\u2026 how many fifth step expert could be found in the entire Eastern Ling Empire? Even the great general that protects this country, the Su general, is only at the fifth step.\u201cAi, that young lady is also really\u2026!!! If you\u2019re going to save people, then just save them! Why did she also have to go and kill young master Zhao?!?\u201d\u201cIf this type of scum in the community is not to be killed, could it be that you wanted to leave him alive to continue to endanger other fellow villagers?\u201d\u201cThen you could have still killed him in secret. Right now, the old uncle and his granddaughter is implicated in this debacle, and Zhao Official also likes to cover up for his son. This begs the questions of how those two kinsfolk could live day to day in the future, ah? Is this really saving them or harming them?\u201cThat\u2019s exactly it. That young lady looks so beautiful and smart. How could she act so impulsively? She and her companions, however, are better off. When the time comes they can slip away and leave the town. But then again, what can those two kinsfolk live on?\u201dHowever, at this time, the two kinsfolk that everyone was talking about were crying on each other\u2019s shoulders, with faces full of suffering and despair.Su Luo\u2019s eyes were pure ice, faintly breathed out a sigh. \u201cMe and my big crow\u2019s beak*, all that I said has hit the mark\u2026.\u201dNangong Liuyun rubbed her head, a pair of deep beautiful eyes lazily watching the people below fighting as if their lives depends on it.

With a simply motion of his fingers, he could have countless young ladies voluntarily delivering themselves to his door. Only this girl, without exception, would not be taken in by his deception.But this way was even better, as it further aroused his determination to chase after her. He must get her.Su Luo irritatedly threw him a glance.Honestly speaking, Nangong Liuyun had an extraordinarily beautiful and youthful appearance.A pitch-black and profound set of pretty, arrogant eyes. He had bright eyes and white teeth, one distinctly light, thin pair of lips, which seemed as if they were plumped from the taste of cinnabar. There was also his highest quality of languid, devilish charm. He had a seemingly unsurpassed grace and bearing, priceless beauty, and was both leisurely and romantic.\u201cThen carefully watch the play, and don\u2019t let your mind randomly wander off.\u201d Su Luo with a somewhat reluctant expression shot him a cold stare. She then turned her face away from him, thus she did not see the wry smile that flashed through the depths of his eyes .At this point in time, the fight in the lobby had long gone past its climax. And only now, it had came to an end.Those people who chose to become bodyguards, generally did not have a high level of martial arts skill, so this very fight had already been predetermined to be Zhao family\u2019s defeat.Even though they had many men and great strength when swarming with these numbers, but how can they hope to last against these little geniuses from the Imperial school: that had came out to improve through experience?Very quickly, the bodyguards from Zhao family had all been decapitated. One could call them so dead that they could never die again.At this time, the blood flowed through the lobby like a river, from the mess of about a dozen fallen corpse. The tragic sight was simply a spectacle too horrible to endure.Miss Liu ran over, pulled up the pair of kinsfolk that were crying so hard that they could no longer stand on their own. Wearing an excited expression, she said. \u201c Rest assured, in the future nobody will dare to bully you guys! Quickly, stop kneeling and stand up. Get up!\u201dMiss Liu on one side believed she had conferred her kindness to these people; and on the other side, her meaningful gaze had not forgotten to aim itself towards the second floor where Su Luo was.Her expression was noticed by Su Luo right away, but Su Luo did not say anything. She only used the corner of her eyes to glance at Nangong Liuyun.Looks like it\u2019s another disaster that will come out because of this evildoer Nangong Liuyun.It went without saying, sometimes the accuracy of a woman\u2019s intuition was really scary.Miss Liu saw the two kinsfolk from before, blankly kneeling in the original place with a numb expression. She can\u2019t help stomping her foot! \u201cI told you not to keep kneeling. Rooting out the strong to give people peace is the duty of us martial artist. You guys don\u2019t have to be so grateful towards me.\u201d\u201cPah\u2014\u2014\u201d Su Luo could not hold back any longer, as she had almost spitting out a mouthful of water.It turned out, this Miss Liu actually thought that those people kneeling and refusing to get up were because they were too grateful for her actions. However, they really didn\u2019t know of a good way to tell her the truth.\u201cWho?\u201d Miss Liu\u2019s ears were sharp, and hearing the sound of ridicule, thump, thump, thump, she ran up. Her eyes directly locked onto Su Luo. \u201cWas it you, before, who was laughing at me?\u201dHowever, by the time she saw Su Luo\u2019s face, her eyes opened really wide, as if extremely shocked.\u201cYou, you are\u2026.\u201d Miss Liu simply could not believe it.\u201cDo I know you? \u201c Su Luo innocently blinked her eyes. Her clear and attractively beautiful eyes seemed to show traces of being perplexed.Miss Liu seeing the Su Luo infront of her eyes, only saw swathes of three che* length white misty muslin gown tailing on the floor, and her face without a touch of cosmetics. Frankly, even by adding cosmetics, one would still be unable to cover up her absolutely stunning complexion, which was like an otherworldly fairy floating on top of the earth.No, not possible.This person was definitely not Su Xi\u2019s good-for-nothing fourth elder sister. It must be a person that resembles her. Besides just based off on that idiot Su Luo, how could she have the qualifications to sit by the side of his highness Prince Jin?That\u2019s right, in fact when Miss Liu saw the Dragon Scaled Horse outside the doorway, she already recognized his highness Prince Jin who was perfect beyond compare. It was actually the case, that in order to give his highness Prince Jin an ideal impression, she had quite uncharacteristically acted to help that pair of kinsfolk.She believed, that this kindness from her will definitely grow into a favorable impression in his highness Prince Jin\u2019s heart. Afterwards\u2026..she would have pretended as if she accidently encountered his highness Prince Jin. She believes she can only rely on this method to get close to the male god of her heart.Also as a result, when Su Luo let out a derisive laugh; she was able to seize the opportunity, directly dashing to arrive on the second floor.*che word for Chinese foot is equivalent to \u2153 of a meter\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She somewhat bashfully stared at Nangong Liuyun. \u201cPrince Jin, is your highness also going to the Sunset Mountain Range?\u201dNangong Liuyun was clothed in a azure brocade robe with the wings of golden serpents embroidered on its cloth. His pair of long, slender, white hands gracefully swirled the wine cup made of jade. From time to time, he would take a sip, with a happy and content demeanor; it was almost as if Miss Liu did not even exist in front of his eyes.Even when Liu Ruohua saw Nangong Liuyun\u2019s icy expression and dismissive manner, she was still not discouraged, she hurried said, \u201cPrince Jin, your, your highness doesn\u2019t remember me? I am Ruohua ah, Liu Ruohua. That time at the Imperial Mage school, your highness gave me pointers on how to cultivate \u2026.\u201dNangong Liuyun\u2019s phoenix-like eyes narrowed and swept her a slight glance. Although he was smiling, the depth of his matchless eyes seem to be indifferent. After quite a while an icy voice delivered, \u201cAre you finished speaking?\u201dLiu Ruohua nervously nodded her head, and prudently observed Nangong Liuyun\u2019s expression.According to Su Xi\u2019s remarks, Prince Jin was the Nine Pagoda Palace\u2019s celestial being. Even looking at him once was blasphemy. Now that she could stand, face to face in front of him, Liu Rouhua felt extremely nervous. Her heart felt like it was about to jump out of her throat.The corners of Nangong Liuyun\u2019s mouth curved up. His eyes were obviously laughing, but their pupils were ice-cold and indifferent. With a trace of impatience in his tone, \u201cthen scram.\u201dHe stingily did not provide her with any superfluous word.Liu Ruohua\u2019s face immediately turned red. She was floundering as she stood there, not knowing what to do.This was such a rare opportunity to get close to his highness, Prince Jin. How could she so easily let it go? By the next time they meet, who knows if there will be such a chance?Liu Ruohua made a fist, inwardly trying to muster up some encouragement for herself. Her stiffed face squeezed out a glittering, bright and beautiful smile. \u201cPrince Jin. Is your highness also planning on going to Sunset Mountain Range? My team is also heading there, so perhaps it would be better if we go together\u2026..\u201dNangong Liuyun\u2019s slender white, jade-like fingers idly fiddled around with his ruby thumb ring. Having heard what was said, his eyes lifted slightly, throwing a dismissive glance her way.This glance, coldly arrogant and distinctively remote yet also with an indomitable air that terrorized all before him; like a sharp sword\u2019s murderous aura, strong enough to make people tremble with fear.That glance made Liu Ruo\u2019s eager heart shrink and clogged to the point where it felt as if a huge boulder was blocking its flow. Unfinished words were swallowed back through her throat and into her stomach. She did not dare to even speak half a phrase more.Her ashen-white face could only feel the cold sweat flowing down, drop by drop.Nangong Liuyun returned his gaze back to watching Su Luo; the smiling expression from the depths of his eyes was dazzling and alluring. His pale hand, smooth as jade, picked up a chopstick full of green vegetables and placed them into Su Luo\u2019s bowl, with a smile that was eagerly attentive and fawning. \u201c How could you attend to the play on such an empty stomach. Now, be obedient and eat another stalk of vegetable.\u201cSu Luo really wanted to roll her eyes.Thinking, she really wanted to ask. \u2018Dear beloved Prince Jin were your royal highness trying to draw more enmity towards me? Did you not see, just across from me, the veins on that young lady\u2019s pair of hands rose up, itching to strangle me?\u2019But Su Luo deserving to be called Su Luo, under Liu Ruohua\u2019s dagger-shaped eyes filled with jealousy. She very calmly and collectedly picked up that stalk of vegetable; unhurriedly nibbling on it, as if it was the most delicious delicacies in the world.When Nangong Liuyun saw that she did not refuse, his face was happy like a blooming flower. Once again he personally held a bowl while ladling the Wild King Mushroom soup into the bowl, with an integrating and saccharine smile. \u201c Come, you should also drink this soup. It\u2019s tasty and nourishing, and it\u2019s not bad.\u201dOpposite of them, like a lonely pestle shaped bundle of wood-pile, Liu Ruohua was so stunned that she almost fell to the floor. She simply could not believe it\u2014\u2014She even wanted to rub her eyes to clearly see this perfect example of male god smiling with such a silly expression in front of her eyes.

His frosty eyes were like a pool of ice, remote and cold as he turned his back on her and knitted his eyebrows. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you scrammed yet?To Nangong Liuyun, there were only two kinds of people: there were people he liked, and the others, who were all considered outsiders.If you were able to be incorporated by him into his universe, he would absolutely shield you and be partial without any need for justification.If you were unable to enter his world, he would always seem courageous but also very scathing, callous, cruel and bloodthirsty.Currently in his eyes, there is only Su Luo. Everybody else was just fleeting like floating clouds.Liu Ruohua bowed her head with respect before his majesty , but her hands were clenched into a fist.Yes, there was no mistake! This gloomy, cold, indifferent person was like Asura, that seemed to come straight out of the center of hell. He was definitely his highness Prince Jin..But, how could he\u2026\u2026Nangong Liuyun\u2019s words were extremely harsh, and most normal women would have already been crying and sent fleeing by now; but Liu Ruohua was different. She already knew about Nangong Liuyun\u2019s cold and callousness, so even if Nangong Liuyun\u2019s words were extremely offensive, she still would not budge.Su Luo looked at Liu Ruohua in a calm composed manner. A thread of admiration flashed across her eyes.She never thought that a person\u2019s face could be so thick-skinned. No matter what happened to her, she could not be driven away. At the same time, she was also a little curious, to what degree of outstanding had Nangong Liuyun reached, in order to make this young lady so persistent? .\u201cAre you full yet?\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s voice sounded similar to nature, like the babbling of running water that warms the heart.\u201cNot yet.\u201d In fact Su Luo could not eat anymore. But in order to watch this spectacular show, she pretended that she still wasn\u2019t full yet.How could Nangong Liuyun not know what she was thinking about? His distinctly jointed slim hand stroked toward her nose like fine jade. He gave a spoiled and indulgent smile. \u201cIf you can\u2019t eat more, then don\u2019t force yourself. If you want to watch the play, then this king will order them to perform it for you to watch\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Su Luo gave a simple refusal . With one shove, she pushed Nangong Liuyun away from being so close to her.Liu Ruohua was dazzled by his smile.She could never have imagined that the ice-cold cruel highness Prince Jin could laugh. Nor could she believe that his laugh would be so tender-hearted that there would even be a hint of fawning feeling.But, but that damn woman dared to reject him. She had even pushed his Royal Highness away.Oh Heavens ! @$^er! Was she really this ignorant, or had this world just gone mad? To think there would exist a woman who would want to push his royal highness, Prince Jin away?!? Was she retarded?At this moment, Liu Ruohua was about to collapse from jealousy. Her eyes earlier were pure and bright. But now it was glowing red from jealousy and laced with a bloodthirsty killing intent. She murderously glared at Su Luo, whom she wished she could hack into itty bitty pieces.Su Luo hardly took it lying down and welcomed her murderous stare. Her mouth hooked into a distinctly cold arc, like indescribably brilliant fireworks that faded into misty nothingness.Su Luo\u2019s eyebrows declined slightly, cynically staring back at Lu Ruohua as if to taunt her.Liu Ruohua, aren\u2019t you very capable? Didn\u2019t you rely on the fact that you are this country\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s daughter, and together with Su Xi, treat the past Su Luo as a dog?What about now? You must be very jealous right? Going mad huh? Really want to kill someone eh?Liu Ruohua bit her lower lip, stressing each syllable, she asked furiously, \u201cwho are you?\u201dSu Luo shrugged, like Nangong Liuyun, she aired an identical attitude of disregard.Liu Ruohua rushed forwards. She grabbed Su Luo\u2019s hands and looked at her wrist. Suddenly her eyes widened, with cruel and cold eyes like the edge of a blade, gritting her teeth said. \u201cYou are Su Luo! You can not deny it.

All of a sudden, she let out a muffled groan.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s facial expression became brash and ruthlessly tyrannical in a flash. His sharp, hawk-like eyes erupted with a dense air of fury and a penetrating, icy-coldnes. If one were to look at him in that instant, they would not be able to tell what he did but would only see the overbearing shadow of his sleeves as they flew past\u2014\u2014As for afterward, well\u2026 there really weren\u2019t any afterwards.Because at this time, Liu Ruohua was already gone from this private room on the second floor.The only thing anyone could see was her meager, thin body, similar to a feathered arrow being shot, jettisoned towards the first floor lobby. She crashed hard and tumbled in excess to the ground, diving face first from the sky. All four of her limbs were tangled together, as she almost passed out from the pain.It was not known if Nangong Liuyun intentionally did it. But when each and everyone of Liu Ruohua\u2019s school companions attempted to perform a mid-air interception, with both of their hands extended, not a single one of them was able to catch her.Moreover, at the time that Liu Ruohua was hurled down; she, by chance, landed on top of young master Zhao\u2019s corpse. She opened her eyes and meet eye to eye with young master Zhao\u2019s wide, open eyes that were full of grievance and a sinisterly twisted expression.\u201cAaahhhHHHH\u2014\u2014.\u201d Liu Ruohua was so frightened that she shrieked. Her entire persons jumped up, forgetting about her foot, which was engulfed in fresh blood; delayed her from being freed from its viscous and stickiness.So it came to pass that the sole of the unfortunate Liu Ruohua\u2019s foot kept on slipping. Once again, having awful luck, she fell to the ground\u2026.At the time she was falling down, a long double-edged sword just happen to be standing there, at her side\u2026..Presently, her whole body, face, and hair were covered entirely with blood\u2026Filthy and with a putrid odor that made people very unwilling to be near her.\u201cRuohua, are you okay?

His eyes were completely filled with shock.Currently, Liu Ruohua\u2019s right hand was severed off at the base of the wrist, and fresh blood continuously gushed out of the wound. It was extremely frightening to look at.Su Luo\u2019s beautiful eyes were serene and deep. A trace of bemusement flashed across her pupils. With a smile that was not quite a smile, she glanced at Nangong Liuyun. \u201cOh\u2026 How terribly cruel, neatly severed at the wrist. This way\u2026 isn\u2019t it too extreme for not having any tender, protective feelings for the fairer sex?\u201dDespite her comments, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s sophisticated scheme were much deeper than he led on.When he had thrown Liu Ruohua down from the second floor, without exception, all of the subsequent reactions were within his calculations.Including when she had sprung up from being frightened, fell, and had her own right wrist fail toward the cold double-edged sword\u2026.Every single step, was all superlatively accurate and it was practically calculated without a flaw.This kind of Nangong Liuyun was, no doubt, supremely terrifying.To chose him as an enemy, was the most stupid decision one could make.A secret trace of concern flashed from the bottom of Su Luo\u2019s heart\u2026.If he sincerely must have her, then how should she deal with it?\u201cSimple, kindhearted, good girls should not take joy in other people\u2019s misfortune eh?\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s fine white fingers gently stroked her right wrist. A trace of pity flashed through his eyes, and his devilishly charming voice sounded downcast. \u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201dHis deep eyes were only fixed upon her. The depths of his pupils were like the an untouched spring pool on top of a snowy mountain: lustrous and translucent, permeating with a desire towards her that was almost too hard to bear.Su Luo was afraid to look into the deeper meaning in his eyes and very quickly turned her face away while faintly saying. \u201cIt has already stopped hurting.\u201dShe want to draw back her hand, but Nangong Liuyun, in one grasp, had already restrained it.

Slowly and gently he caressed them as if touching a matchless treasure.The hollow between his palms felt deep and profound, giving Su Luo a sense of security that she had never experienced before.Everything around them seemed to be very quiet.

In the end, he swallowed the last part of the sentence and was unable to make another sound.J-J-Jin, his highness, Prince Jin\u2026.How could it be him?Nangong Liuyun leisurely leaned on the wooden chair. From his extremely stern, noble, and handsome face an expression of toying with someone slowly emerged. A nefarious and demonically alluring smile appeared as his gaze became dense and overcast with ice that could penetrate into the very bone marrow of the people who saw it. \u201cThis king caused the injuries. What about it?\u201dHe was currently issuing a kind of incomparable imposing manner, like a giant taking one step and making the earth tremble and mountains shake. Such an insufferably arrogant manner and unrestrained ego.Liu Wei was suffering from shock and terror. He had never thought that he would actually encounter his highness Prince Jin here. Moreover, just a moment ago he had gone so far as to loudly insult his highness. He was really\u2026 truly damned!As he considered all these factors, his forehead became covered with sweat, flowing down drop by drop. His face was so ashen-white that it was frightening to behold.Nangong Liuyun looked disdainfully out of the corner of his eyes, his gaze shone with cold electric light. \u201cAnything else?\u201dAt this very moment, he seem like a giant with a head that carried the sky and feet on the ground. High beyond belief, while at the same time,possessing a seemingly regal grandeur.How could Liu Weiming dare to sputter even half a word more? His rigid face nevertheless squeezed out a smile, the depth of his eyes full of alarm, eagerly answered. \u201cNo, nothing your highness please don\u2019t mind me and enjoy your meal\u2026 take your time\u2026.\u201dIn front of Prince Jin, he was scared to even exhale audibly. He lowered his eyelids, very quickly bowed and retreat out of the room. He also very mindfully closed the door after himself.Behind him there were people who did not recognize Prince Jin. They still hot-bloodedly wanted to rush in but were restrained by Liu Weiming\u2019s firm death grip.Because Liu Weiming quite clearly understood, if the action was taken by Prince Jin, then he was afraid that Liu Ruohua\u2019s wrist was severed in vain. Even if her own father personally sought out redress, he would also return without success.Besides, having offended his highness Prince Jin but to only lose one arm. That should be considered getting off lightly, no? Liu Ruohua had no other choice than to take this as a lesson in demanding too much good fortune for oneself.Out of all the people she could have offended\u2026 against all expectations! Who told her to go and rile up the living version of the Hell King, Yama, his highness Prince Jin?Seeing Liu Weiming straight away retreat out with deference, Su Luo was somewhat surprised.She knows that Prince Jin\u2019s reputation was quite great. It had even, at some times, appeared to be quite scary. However, she could never have believed that he would actually be terrifying to such a degree.The other side had their wrist chopped off and was so afraid that they couldn\u2019t even breath heavily, so where would they find the courage to dare to demand justice?Was Nangong Liuyun\u2019s reputation always this frightful? Su Luo, with one hand supporting her bright and cleanly tapered chin, curiously looked at Nangong Liuyun from top to bottom. She carefully took his measure, as if it was the first time that she meet him.\u201cYou want to look at me that much? Want a more in-depth look?\u201d Nangong Liuyun laugh was really infuriating. He pulled Su Luo\u2019s hand to touch inside the cloth covering his chest.No\u2026 it was the exact same. Not even a tiny bit terrifying. Su Luo subconsciously shooked her head.\u201cAre you shocked,\u201d said Nangong Liuyun as he ruminatively rubbed her head.He knew what she was thinking about. His tender and gentle side was only displayed in front of her, so how could she ever possibly imagine his savage side in front of others.\u201cIn the end which side your is real self? Su Luo\u2019s face held a quiet, content, and untroubled smiling expression, like the dewy pear blossom: refreshingly clean and alluringly beautiful.\u201cWhich side do you like?\u201d Nangong\u2019s thin, pink lips, with a quisitive demeanor raised somewhat slightly.

Su Luo was not going to play the fool again.Just then, a fit of noisy quarrelling could be heard coming from the first floor lobby.Numerous soldiers had encircled the entire restaurant and formed a densely packed, impenetrable formation such that not even a fly could escape.After the senior provincial official Zhao found out the news about his son\u2019s death, his entire body almost collapsed. He secured a pike to his back, then straddling the back of a horse, he sped over to the restaurant at a whirlwind\u2019s speed.Just when Liu Weiming and his companions were discussing when they should take their leave, the troops Official Zhao brought just happen to conveniently arrive to detain them at the door.Both sides were at a standoff, as neither was willing to yield.Liu Ruohua carried the weight of young master Zhao\u2019s murder such that even her death could not wipe out the crimes.* Official Zhao\u2019s heart was already set on getting revenge for his son!He obstinately clung to one course of action; today he must fetch Liu Ruohua\u2019s head which sat on top of her neck\u2026 Even the fact that her father was the Prime Minister could not change Official Zhao\u2019s original intentions.But how could Liu Weiming and his companions agree to this? Each and everyone of them was from one of the large and influential families of the imperial court. The elders\u2019 governmental positions of everyone of their families, when presented, were all higher than Official Zhao\u2019s.Thus, both sides started to battle it out.Official Zhao could not be compared to his useless, spineless-coward of a son. He was after all a formidable fifth ranked martial artist. Just one masterful feint from his lance would be very difficult for even a few people to withstand.In the end, because of this domineering strength, Liu Ruohua\u2019s party finished having suffered a crushing defeat.Official Zhao\u2019s long pike rested on top of Liu Ruohua\u2019s shoulder, as its sharp tip murderously glittered like frost and snow.Official Zhao\u2019s grim appearance was similar to a demon\u2019s that had come from Hell. His face was covered with a dense aura of death as he ominously said, \u201c kill yourself or be killed, pick one.\u201dAt this time, Liu Ruohua\u2019s blood from her severed wrist had already stopped flowing. Her face was ashen-white like a piece of white paper, and she could barely even stand upright. However, she was not even a bit panicked. Coldly smiling, she said, \u201cyou, but an insignificant official, dare to threaten this young lady? Believe it or not, in no time at all, this young lady will have you in shackles and thrown in jail!\u201dOfficial Zhao\u2019s expression remained somber, and his whole persons was ice-cold and violently ruthless. \u201cWill you kill yourself or do you want to be killed?\u201dHis expression was terribly frightening. It could even be compared to a devil that had fought its way out of a blood-soaked arena of purgatory, frigidly cold without a trace of emotions.Official Zhao had spent his whole life obsessed with practice and cultivation, thus he had neglected to discipline his son, leading to this tragic event. Consequently he blamed himself. Still to shield his pride from own shortcomings, he absolutely would not let the murderer of his son escape.Even if she was a woman, even if she was the Prime Minister\u2019s daughter!Liu Ruohua saw the merciless killing intent on Official Zhao\u2019s face, and a trace of fear flared from her heart. But she calmly remained unyielding and maintained a cold expression \u201cYou want to kill me? Have you asked his highness Prince Jin, yet?\u201dHis highness Prince Jin? Suddenly a thread of shocked terror appeared on Official Zhao\u2019s face, who had been caught up in the frenzied circumstances.His highness Prince Jin was absolutely a stunning existence in the hearts of martial artist.Since the beginning of the continent\u2019s history, his innate skill was counted as number two. At less than twenty years of age, he had already advanced to the sixth rank. Rumor has it that he was already at the peak of the six rank, and not far from entering the threshold of the seventh rank.Such a genius who wouldn\u2019t worship? Moreover, who would dared to be his enemy?\u201cHis highness Prince Jin?\u201d Official Zhao frowned, repeating the last sentence. Was it because his useless son committed an offense against his highness Prince Jin, that had provoked his death?*death could not wipe out the crimes \u2013 dreadful crimes that rankled even after the perpetrator is dead.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He is currently upstairs. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can go and check yourself!\u201dIt seemed there were times when even Liu Ruohua could use her brains.If you examined each individual word she had said, you would find that everyone of them had been true. But if put together it would create nothing short of a suspicious misunderstanding by implying that his highness Prince Jin and her group were travelling together as part of the same party.Liu Ruohua only wanted to take advantage of Prince Jin\u2019s *tiger skin*, so Official Zhao would have no other option than to relinquish his enmity and let her go.This could only work, because she understood clearly what his highness Prince Jin\u2019s status was in the hearts and minds of martial artist.Sure enough, Official Zhao\u2019s expression appeared to loosen a tiny bit.Liu Ruohua\u2019s gaze darted towards the tightly closed window, and doors on the second floor. She persisted in her deception, \u201cif you were to kill me, his highness Prince Jin would never let you get away with it! You don\u2019t get it?!? My father and his majesty the emperor already have a secret mutual understanding. Before too long I will be Prince Jin\u2019s imperial concubine. Hump\u2026you dare to kill me!??\u201dOnce these words were spoken, everyone was in an uproar.There was a multitude of people standing in a circle watching. Each and everyone of them started to frown. They certainly did not wish for his highness Prince Jin to take such a brain-dead, bossy , handicapped with a severed-hand woman as wife.Official Zhao\u2019s wrinkled brows became even more tight. The pike resting upon Liu Ruohao\u2019s neck was trembling slightly.Su Luo was lazily reclining on the chair. A pair of clear and bright eyes were fixed on Nangong Liuyun. The tip of her eyebrows rose slightly in a provoking manner.She somewhat tauntingly said, \u201cyo, your highness Prince Jin. It\u2019s your highness\u2019s turn to be the hero and rescue the beauty now. Why isn\u2019t your highness quickly rushing down to save your future princess? If you don\u2019t go now the beauty\u2019s head will surely only be able to reside away from her body.\u201dBut Nangong Liuyun only pulled Su Luo into his embrace, as the corner of his mouth lifted into a devious arc. A blazing hot breath puffed near her ears. \u201cWhat is wrong? Are you feeling jealous because of this king?\u201d\u201cI, Su Luo eat sweets, eat salt, but never do I*drink vinegar*.\u201d Su Luo\u2019s expression was like a smile but not a smile. Her meaningful glance was just as it had been before; matchless beautiful and indifferent. \u201cCould it be your highness Prince Jin really won\u2019t go?\u201d\u201cGo, how could this king not go?\u201d Nangong Liuyun tugged Su Luo up from her seat. \u201cIf this king did not go now, the future princess of this king will get angry.\u201dSu Luo was walking by Nangong Liuyun\u2019s side but could not see his expression. At this moment Nangong Liuyun\u2019s thin lips were narrowed in a cold, demonic manner. A pair of beautiful eyes that were both compellingly pretty and flirtatious. seemed to release an intense and harsh killing intentTwo people, one on the left and another on the right, leisurely took the staircase down.The entrance to the staircase was originally crowded full of people. But at this time the people automatically made a path for them.Nangong Liuyun acted as if they were alone, all the while guiding Su Luo along. Step by step treading on the wooden staircase, his bearing was relaxed and carefree. The crowd was watching on either side, but in the eyes of Nangong Liuyun and Su Luo, they were nothing but single heads of Chinese cabbages.\u201cYour highness Prince Jin!\u201d Liu Ruohua saw Prince Jin coming down, and a complex expression darted across her eyes. It was not just a look of being pleasantly surprise. It was also filled with expectancy, apprehension, and every flavor of uneasy emotions. But her final expression was very firm.It was because she did not lie, and her father definitely had said this exact sentence before, that she was betrothed to his highness Prince Jin. Furthermore his majesty the Emperor seemed to have given his consent by nodding.Official Zhao watched as his highness Prince Jin step by step walked down.Although he had never seen him with his own eyes, but he was definitely certain. The outstanding youth in front of his eyes, was absolutely the legendary rumored Prince Jin.Presently his highness Prince Jin was just like a dragon that had hidden away inside the abyss. His usually hid away so deep there was not a chance of him being seen. But once he showed himself, he certainly would startle the heavens and move the earth!Official Zhao frown tightened even more. He must avenge the death of his only son, but also does not want to offend his highness Prince Jin.\u201cIs his highness Prince Jin here to urge peace?\u201d Official Zhao\u2019s expression was cold. His gaze, like electricity, was unwaveringly fixed on Nangong Liuyun.\u201cThis king has no other meaning.\u201d Nangong Liuyun smilingly said. \u201cHowever, open your eyes wide and look clearly. The person here is this king\u2019s future princess, so develop your brain and don\u2019t believe what anyone says. You didn\u2019t even know that you had just been swindled.\u201d*tiger skin \u2013 reputation*drink vinegar \u2013 the Chinese characters apart literally say eat vinegar, together the characters represent being jealous.

All of a sudden it was as if it had pushed Liu Ruohua into the abyss of Hell.\u201cYour highness Prince Jin!\u201d Liu Ruohua was so anxious that her tears flowed like a river, \u201cYour highness you can\u2019t do this, please your highness can\u2019t\u2026 I beseech your highness to save Ruohua, I beseech your highness\u2026.\u201dOnly Prince Jin could save her now, but it was quite obvious that his highness Prince Jin had never ever shown any benevolence. Infact, it was because of this that he was widely known as being ice-cold and cruel.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s pair of eyes seemed to be embedded with a thin layer of frost. His lightly colored lips evoked a disingenuous, demonic smile. His tone was soft and gentle yet carried a strong air of harsh killing intent. \u201cIn the future, you shouldn\u2019t run your mouth so as to confuse other people with your lies. Otherwise this king\u2019s future princess will be very unhappy\u2026then the consequences will really be quite severe.\u201dSu Luo rolled her eyes toward the sky. This man! Would it kill him for once if he did not try to take advantage off her?Liu Ruohua nevertheless at once apparently understood something critical. She abruptly kneeled down and vigorously kowtowed in front of Su Luo. \u201cThe honorable fourth Miss Su, Su Luo.Before, it was me whose actions were inexcusable to you. I now kowtow to you and I implore you to please save me. I beg you.\u201dShe was a daughter from the Prime Minister\u2019s stately residence, a person who had always been in the heart of thousands- no tens of thousands of peoples. How could she have ever been subjected to such insults? This was indeed a tiger fallen out of the grasslands and being taken for a fool by a dog. Once she returns to the imperial capital, at that time she will never let these people get away with this humiliation! Liu Ruohua secretly held these grudges deeply within her heart.But, what kind of person was Su Luo? While others had been studying in elementary school, she had already killed people with her own hand.And what was the most important part that a person learned after having trained to be an assassin? It was, of course, their state of mind.Su Luo\u2019s face was now calm and elegant. Her eyes contained clear spring water that spread in ripples. She was dressed in a graceful snow-white gown that accentuate her simple elegance, like that of an immortal.She only had a very apologetic smile, then without saying a word, she was pulled away by Nangong Liuyun.\u201cWait!\u201d Liu Ruohua, seeing that Su Luo was about to leave, her expression suddenly became stiff, and a trace of panic passed through her heart. She immediately yelled loudly towards what she could see of Su Luo\u2019s back.Su Luo stopped her footsteps but did not turn her head.From the back, her shoulders seem to be curved by a knife. Her waist naturally well balanced, flesh shone like polished amberstone and her aura was like a serene orchid. Her whole persons was refined and gorgeous just like an immortal fairy that was above the common populace.\u201c I can tell you a secret, so you have to let me live!\u201d Liu Ruohua\u2019s tone suddenly became lofty and arrogant, once again.\u201cNo need,\u201d Su Luo faintly smiled, then, once again, she slowly strode away.\u201cW-wait! It\u2019s related to your personal background!\u2019 Liu Ruohua coldly smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you are not interested in knowing your own background? Do you really think that the Su general is really your true, biological father? Do you really feel that the Su family really are your roots? Let me tell you the truth, because it\u2019s not!\u201dSu Luo\u2019s beautiful eyes were completely neutral and pure. Her pink lips hooked into a minute sneer.In her previous life and this life, the thing that she loathe the most was being blackmailed.\u201cThank you for bringing this to my attention. However even if you die, the people of the Su family are not dead. I will naturally go and ask them.\u201d Su Luo\u2019s facial expression remained motionless, but a trace of suspicion blazed through her heart.\u201cBah! In this world, outside of me, nobody will tell you! The Su family, the people in the Su family simply do not know!\u201d Liu Ruohua\u2019s expression was full of confidence and certainty.Su Luo frowned slightly. She recalled the original owner of her body\u2019s bitter experience in Su Manor. That was basically an inhuman way to live. Su Wan had also been given birth by a concubine, and her talent was also very poor; but her treatment compared to Su Luo\u2019s were completely opposite.Could it be, that there had been some other reason in the universe that was related to her background?Nangong Liuyun, step by step, walked toward Liu Ruohua. His star like eyes overflowed with treacherous cunningness and grim radiance, so frigidly cold that the area around them reached subzero temperatures..\u201cOkay,\u201d his alluring red lips curved up into a cold expression full of demonic insincerity, ice-cold and heartless. \u201cNow you can say it.\u201dNobody knew what Liu Ruohua whispered close to Nangong Liuyun\u2019s ears, because Nangong Liuyun\u2019s expression from start to finish was indifferent and ice-cold.

Ancient trees reaching high into the sky, and all kinds of rare birds, animals and exotic beasts; that, at any given time, were being born or dying.The mountain ranges covered an area the size of a province. Close to the deepest part of the mountains near its center, there were also countless varieties of precious and rare medicinal herbs.All magical beast were aware of their territories. The more powerful a magical beast was, the closer their lair and territory would be to the center of the mountain ranges. Thus, very few people could get close to the center. Because this went on for tens of thousands of years, it allowed the numerous rare and precious medicinal herbs to accumulate.Nangong Liuyun was guiding Su Luo into the forest through a winding path on the east side.\u201cHow much longer will it take before we get to see an Armored Back Dragon?\u201d Several fine locks of hair on Su Luo\u2019s forehead were curved slightly, emphasizing a pair of large, vividly fresh eyes that were as sparkling and translucent as jade. They gave off an indescribable feeling that was both touching and full of life.Two days had already passed since they arrived in the mountains. But in these two days the only magical beasts that they encountered were weak ones. If it hadn\u2019t been rabbit types then it had been deer types. This means they were still circling around the outer periphery of the forest.\u201cThe Armored Back Dragon is near the center of the forest. It will take another three or four days to get there.\u201d Nangong Liuyun lovinging rubbed her head. His pair of beautiful eyes hid a touch of tenderness. Then he was asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you tired now?\u201dHe was dressed in a large, white embroidered robe. The Chinese-styled robe was simple and elegant imprinted with patterns of obscure crescent moons. That tempting flowing robe set off his body as an invitation to the pearls among the womanly flowers. He was enticingly charming to all things living.Being so close to him, Su Luo could smell the light fragrance of the jasper flower on his body. A kind of gentle flavor that held the summer heat. It was an extremely nice scent.\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Su Luo somewhat regretfully pointed to the medicinal herbs around them. \u201cLook, hundred year-old Lingzhi mushrooms and hundred year-old Ginseng are everywhere, but we can\u2019t take any of them along. It\u2019s such a waste. If only my space was opened, then I could definitely take all of these precious medicinal herbs.\u201d\u201cThe effectiveness of these herbs is just too low.\u201c Nangong Liuyun shooked his head, with a disdainful expression and then said. \u201cWait until we enter the center of the forest, then you will understand. At that time, this king guarantees that you can collect to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d\u201cOh, by the way, the group of people that have been constantly following behind us: It won\u2019t be a problem, right?\u201d Su Luo\u2019s beautiful eyes roamed around and the corner of her mouth lifted into a decidedly cold arc. It resembled a dazzling fireworks that had faded into something faintly discernible, and then to nothingness.Two days ago, after Nangong Liuyun saved Liu Ruohua. In response, that small group followed tightly behind them as they entered into the Sunset Mountain Range.However, they followed neither near nor far behind. They also did not come forth to greet them*.Su Luo\u2019s eyes flashed with a trace of suspicion.She still had no idea what Nangong Liuyun was thinking. Why would he unexpectedly acquiescence to having them following behind? Even though, they did left a distance of about one hundred meters in between them.But according to Nangong Liuyun\u2019s previous disposition, shouldn\u2019t he have already, with a bored expression, driven those people away?\u201cEven though they are waste of lives, they also may have their uses. Therefore it\u2019s best to make the most use out of them while we can, so as not to randomly squander such an opportunity for exploitation.\u201d This was Nangong Liuyun\u2019s response.This response only served to make Su Luo even more confused.He enjoyed the view of this girl\u2019s beautiful eyes wandering around like rushing water in front of his eyes. After much thought, her expression remained ever perplexed. Nangong Liuyun felt that this expression was really cute.Nangong Liuyun gave a mysterious smile, as he touched her head fawningly, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out very soon.\u201dHis tone of voice was gentle,indolent, and quite nice to hear.In the forest, ancient trees reached high into the sky, surrounded by verdant and lush vegetation. The area of this ancient, primordial forest was a sight to behold.From far away, you could hear the deafening sounds of magical beasts roaring through the tress.The cause of Su Luo\u2019s befuddlement, was that Nangong Liuyun did not walk in a straight line toward the center of the forest. Rather he kept strolling around in twisty circles, as if he was looking for something.\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s pair of eyes shone like the sunlight, reflecting off a bright luster as clean as the clearest pond. It was as if some glorious stones had gathered together all the brilliance while simultaneously carrying a hint of gentleness and warmth.Even though Su Luo had an astonishing amount of talent, at this moment, she was nothing more than an ordinary person that had zero spiritual strength. In the midst of this primordial forest, where magical beasts run amuck, who knew what things one could encounter.*them* \u2013 refers to Su Luo\u2019s group\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Don\u2019t tell me that you think I don\u2019t have even the slightest capacity to protect myself?\u201dRight now she did not really have any spiritual strength, but her previous life had provided her with more than ten years of hellish training. Moreover her career as an assassin wasn\u2019t just some useless walk in the park either.The kind of blood-thirsty instinct to slaughter had perfected a single-minded, fearless, and tenacious heartSuddenly, a meaningful smile that was not quite a smile surfaced from the depth of Nangong Liuyun\u2019s eyes. He was currently hand in hand with Su Luo, when he suddenly pulled her behind his back and stopped in his tracks, not moving.His beautiful lily-white hands were holding Su Luo\u2019s hands. His gaze was languid and devilishly charming, yet it seemed to continuously hold a look of a ruthless tyrant.All of a sudden, his mouth elicited a sinister smile and he unhurriedly let loose but two words. \u201cIt\u2019s coming.\u201dWhat was coming?Su Luo\u2019s heart was full of curiosity. From his tall, straight, and well-favored back, she peaked out, following his gaze and looked toward the front.From a distance about more than one hundred meters away, she saw an enormous coiled python.The python was no less than ten meters long; its lower body was coiled into a crude crater. The scales that covered its body was a gorgeous rainbow color. Its bloody mouth gaped wide open, like a sacrificial bowl; and its split tongue was the size of an averaged-sized snake, which gave off a vengeful and malevolent impression!\u201cWild Serpent, fourth ranked magical beast with a very strong attack power and highly poisonous.\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s dark red lips softly informed, giving Su Luo the detailed explanation.If it were any other, he naturally would not have said a word.\u201cHiss\u2026.hisssss\u2014\u2014.\u201d The large python\u2019s mouth hissed its snake-like tongue, then its mouth let loose a dense green fog.At this time, a spotted deer, momentarily passing through without checking, became contaminated by the miasma. Not long after it had come in contact with the poison, the entire body of the spotted deer started to seize.It was as if its body was covered in some kind of corrosive, for even the naked eye could watch the rapid rate of decay as it slowly claimed the deer. By the time it finally collapsed, there was only a white skeleton left.On the ground the dense green ink like substance was similar to a carbonated juice, continuously releasing small air bubbles. The air still had a strong stench of rot.From start to finish, the spotted deer\u2019s decay -which started from being robustly alive to being a corroded puddle of melted flesh and bare bones-, took no more than ten minutes.\u201cSuch a toxic poison,\u201d Su Luo suddenly had a feeling of absolute horror.This poison was absolutely more terrifying than the most concentrated sulfuric acid. Despite this, the snake venom could indeed be great stuff for wiping out any trace of corpses. This function was why people would often journey far from home to obtain it.Su Luo asked herself honestly, in the event that she came across such a large python. If she wanted to beat it. It would nearly be impossible.Of course, if she fought with the thought of mutual destruction, it\u2019s not like she wouldn\u2019t have the ability to battle against it.In a brief moment, this giant python had given her a vivid lesson.The existence of the Wild Serpent taught her, that once she entered Sunset Mountain Range, she must think of how to proceed carefully by adapting to the matters at hand. If she want to walk out safely and intact. In the forest she must take care with each and every step with constant vigilance.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s pair of deep eyes were like a night-black pearl in the middle of the deep sea, shimmering with luminous radiance. He smilingly said. \u201cGirl. Neglect the fundamentals and concentrate on the details. The most useful part of this Wild Serpent is not really its poison.\u201d\u201cCould it be its central monster core?\u201d Isn\u2019t it said that a snake\u2019s inner core can solve the riddle of hundreds of poisons?Nangong Liuyun\u2019s dark red lips curved up into a mysterious smile. His eyes were overflowing with brilliant lights and vibrant colors. \u201cVery soon you will know.\u201dThe person who loved to keep people on tenterhooks the most was him. Su Luo somewhat frustratedly pouted her red lips.Before, what Liu Ruohua told him regarding her background, he had unexpectedly kept it a tightly held secret. He wouldn\u2019t even reveal even half a sentence to her.At this moment, the Wild Serpent had already discovered their presence.Its mouth, splitting out a snake-like tongue, slithered and crawled toward them, with fangs bared giving off a sinister appearance.However, what astounded Su Luo the most, it had unexpectedly\u2026.unexpectedly completely ignored her and Nangong Liuyun. It directly passed them and moved towards their rear.This in turn made Su Luo, who had been looking forward to Nangong Liuyun battling it out with the Wild Serpent, somewhat disappointed\u2026.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But when discussing black hearts, whose could be more sinister than Nangong Liuyun\u2019s?Nangong Liuyun\u2019s eyes were as clear, bright and dazzling as cut diamonds. Their appearance was extremely good at hypnotizing people\u2019s wills with an unusually violent, ruthless, and tyrannical power. He patted Su Luo\u2019s head, and a sly nefarious smile smile started to form from the depth of his eyes. \u201cObediently watch the play. It will be absolutely marvelous, and this king guarantees thatSatisfied? Really? Then I must watch carefully. Su Luo crossed both of her arms over her chest. Calmly and at ease, she leaned on one side of Nangong Liuyun\u2019s body with a pondering smile in her eyes.When Liu Ruohua and her team saw the Wild Serpent, an expression of wild ecstasy flashed across their eyes!The reason they had come to Sunset Mountain Range had been to collect items, and one of their tasks was the acquisition of a Wild Serpent\u2019s monster core core.Consequently, before they had entered Sunset Mountain Range, they spent a large sum of money to buy some Crimson Hearted Flower. Nothing was better than the Crimson Hearted Flowers to attract Wild Serpents.What they don\u2019t know was that this was the reason why Nangong Liuyun had allowed them to continuously followed him.Because Nangong Liuyun knew that if only relying on his own luck, he may not have good enough luck to bump into a Wild Serpent. But since Liu Ruohua\u2019s group brought with them the Crimson Hearted Flowers, the chances that they would encounter one were near definite.Wild Serpent\u2019s inner core could neutralize hundreds of poisons, especially the miasma in the air around the forest. Therefore Nangong Liuyun must prepare this item for Su Luo.Liu Ruohua\u2019s team had a total of six people: two women and four men. Their cultivations levels was around the second to third ranks.The six of them together attacked the Wild Serpent.In a matter of moments, water arrows, fireballs, wind blades\u2026countless attacks were concentrated on the Wild Serpent\u2019s body.The Wild Serpent spit out its venom, and a dense, dark-green fog saturated the air in all directions. These bursts of loathsome noxious gas spread towards them.Its speed wasn\u2019t really that fast, but its face appeared to emit a malevolent smile, giving off a calm and composed serpent\u2019s hiss.Both sides\u2019 strength were seemingly comparable . Thus, they fought each other for a long time without success. No one side could prevail over the other, so for the moment, it was extremely difficult to determine the victors and the defeated.Suddenly under the sunlight, the flowery crown of top of the Wild Serpent started to shine and flicker. The multi-colored rays of light it seemed to flash, were as bright as the moon and would bring anyone an absolutely horrifying feeling of alarm and panic.\u201cNot good,\u201d loudly shouted Liu Weiming with an ashen face. \u201cThis Wild Serpent is about to have a breakthrough. Everyone, quickly increase your efforts to kill it. We can\u2019t wait until it have advanced to the fifth rank, otherwise the only road left for us is death!\u201dThe Wild Serpent was very vengeful, so if you attacked it and didn\u2019t kill it, it would always give chase after you until it had finally killed you.When comparing the strength of a fifth ranked versus a fourth ranked Wild Serpent, the difference was like heaven and earth, a distance that was just too huge.A fourth ranked Wild Serpent they could still fight. However, once the fifth rank was reached, they would only be tyrannized.But, his discovery was a step too late.The entire body of the Wild Serpent was shrouded by golden rays of light, and the dark-green fog continued to fill the air in all directions. Once again, a loathsome stench of poison floated around the forest in disarray.In an instant, the flowery crown on its head seemed to transform into a jade horn.The jade horn was exceptionally dazzling, and, under the sunlight, it glistened so much that it lit up its surroundings. It existed as a continuous flow of brilliance like an infinite number of lightning strikes .\u201cHeavens! This Wild Serpent actually knows lightning magic!\u201d Liu Weiming face became pale. He felt like he was about to go mad.The lightning system\u2019s attack and firepower was the strongest among all the elements, and it was also very rare. Also among magical beasts the cultivation of the lightning element was even more rare. Who would have known? One of their tasked items would be a freak of nature of such an extent!\u201cHiss\u2026.Hisssssss\u2014\u2014.\u201d The jade horn on the Wild Serpent\u2019s head flashed with brilliant rays of light with traces of thunder and lightning.Liu Weiming shouted loudly, \u201cRetreat! Quickly retreat!\u201dHowever, it was already too late.They could only watch as the jade horn on the head of the Wild Serpent\u2019s strong firepower, pointed at its target and instantly struck home.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Bing..bing..bing\u2026sprayed the bullets. Sparks flew and dragon-snakes danced in the air; the battlefield situation was extremely fierce.Liu Weiming was the first one to be hit and could only see him momentarily stunned. His entire body was as rigid as steel, his hair was charred black and standing straight up. He was truly a very sorry figure at the moment. .The second person to be hit was none other than Liu Ruohua. Because she had been wounded before, the marks of blood on her body were still not dried yet. Thus the Wild Serpent\u2019s attention was even more attracted to her.Very quickly this team was being taken advantage of by the Wild Serpent.The Wild Serpent was not in a hurry to kill off this team. It laughed malevolently, as its remote and icy-cold expression locked on to them. Its eyes was so eerie that they penetrated into the depth\u2019s of their souls.A pair of icy eyes glared at this team making everyone of them absolutely horrified. They were shivering in terror, and their hearts were extremely panicked.\u201cTeam\u2026Team leader. Quickly think of an idea!\u201d\u201cTeam leader, Save us!\u201dAt this moment, almost all of them were urging Liu Weiming to act. After all, he had spoken with his highness Prince Jin. It was for this reason that he was viewed the most suitable to speak on their behalf.Liu Weiming was still very anxious; seeing the two people watching the play not far away, a complexed expression flashed across his eyes.He knew, with his highness Prince Jin\u2019s cold and detached personality, he probably would watch them all get swallowed up by the Wild Serpent. Afterwards, he might even turn around confidently and with ease walk away.Compassion, sympathy, benevolence\u2026these virtues would not appear on his body.At this time, the Wild Serpent was splitting out scarlet snake bombs , Liu Weiming\u2019s neck went back and forth. Finally, Liu Weiming\u2019s feet weakened at the knees, and he anxiously shouted, \u201cYour highness Prince Jin, save us! I beg your highness please! If your highness don\u2019t take action now, we will definitely die!\u201dNangong Liuyun languishly reclined against an ancient tree. His phoenix eyes narrowed and the corner of his mouth lifted into a resplendent demonic smile. His bright blood-red lips shone like they were scattered throughout with glossy and shimmering gems. However, it remained silent not saying a word.Seeing that his highness hadn\u2019t the slightest thought of taking action, Liu Weiming and his companions were becoming very anxious.There was only one life, so once they were dead, there was nothing. Each and everyone of them was an arrogant, spoiled child of the heavens. How could they just die in such a helpless manner?One after another, each and everyone of them shouted for help towards Nangong Liuyun.\u201cAhhhhhh\u2014\u2014!!!\u201d Suddenly a desperate cry bursted out from among the crowd.As it turned out it was from a youngster among the team. His entire right leg had been swallowed by the Wild Serpent in one bite.Immediately his leftover half of leg\u2019s blood rushed forth like spring water. It was so painful that he was rolling around on the ground.Furthermore, the tooth of a Wild Serpent contained highly toxic poison, it possessed violently strong corrosive properties.One could only see the youngster rolling around on the ground grabbing his right leg, as fresh blood was covered in countless tiny poisonous bubbles that burst forth. It seemed as though it was spreading from the bottom up.His entire body was in pain from the corrosion; it ought to be more painful than lingering at death\u2019s door from receiving a thousands cut or at least not far behind.As this youngster rolled around on the ground, he let loose another terrifying screaming. Finally he just couldn\u2019t stand it, he pulled out a dagger and thrust it straight into his own heart.Watching the youngster who had immediately become a white skeleton after his last breath. Then recalling how just moments ago he had been so vividly alive among them, Liu Weiming and company momentarily had a sense of sympathy for their like-minded comrades in distress.Even though it concluded this way, Nangong Liuyun deep, dark eyes were just like the quiet ocean under the white clouds, tranquil and unfathomable.It was as if the death of the youngster was not even a bit gruesome to him.Only until this moment, did Liu Weiming and company truly understood how cold-blooded and heartless his highness Prince Jin really was.In the beginning they fancied the notion that they were lucky to be following behind his highness Prince Jin. Even more, they earnestly hoped that at the time, when they came across danger then they can obtain his helping hand.Naive, they were truly too naive.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His expression was like the deep blue ocean under white clouds; they were so profoundly mysterious, that nobody could guess what he was thinking about in his heart.However, Su Luo, who was of a similar type to him, realized his intentions, and her beautiful eyes vividly began to analyze the situation in full. A trace of interest flashed from their depths.\u201cName a price. Everyone should be able to say how many silvers each of their lives is worth.\u201d Su Luo had an indifferent expression.Nangong Liuyun evoked an expression that was like a smile yet not a smile. His handsome countenance was pretty yet threatening.Sure enough, the person who had understood him the most was his Luo girl.\u201cUhhh\u2026.\u201d Liu Weiming would never have thought that the reason his highness did not lend a hand was because he was waiting for them to offer him money. This was too\u2026.\u201cIf you want to live then quickly give me a quote, otherwise, who knows which of you next will be eaten alive by the Wild Serpent.\u201d Su Luo\u2019s beautiful eyes narrowed and an unspeakable cunning evil smile appeared in its depth.At the same time her heart was being filled with secret curses and unspoken criticism.Nangon Liuyun you are too much. He obviously was targeting the jade horn on the Wild Serpent\u2019s head. No matter what they did, he would have killed the Wild Serpent. But still he insisted on letting these people spend money on purchasing their lives.What\u2019s even more, this Wild Serpent had only come out because Liu Weiming and company drew it out. Nangong Liuyun was really *grabbing feathers from a flying goose*, calculated to the end.Sure enough, he had said he never invested in losing businesses; at least this point was indeed true.\u201cUnder my name I have five stores, I can offer you all of it\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cI will use two Manors with large gardens to exchange\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cI, I have one thousand taels\u2014\u2014\u201d Liu Ruohua saw the Wild Serpent kept rotating around her, trembling with fear she shrieked loudly.\u201cSo in the end your life is only worth one thousand taels? it\u2019s so very cheap.\u201d Su Luo with both hands encircled around her chest, with a smiling expression that was not quite a smile, the words coming out of her mouth had a double meaning.\u201cOne, one ten thousand tael! ahh\u2014\u2014my foot\u2014\u2014\u201d Liu Ruohua was so scared that she started to cry loudly.It was unknown if Nangong Liuyun was satisfied with the ten thousand tael, or if it was because he felt that leaving Liu Ruohua alive had a little more use. In short, just when the Wild Serpent was about to bit off Liu Ruohua\u2019s thigh\u2026.He acted.You could only see that Nangong Liuyun\u2019s entire body started to shine with golden rays of light. After that, it rapidly spread to the center of his palm. Finally it followed along his fingers and shot outwards.Like the golden tip of a double-edged sword.\u201cswoosh\u2014\u2014\u201dThe sound rung, the golden tip ruthlessly pierced toward the Wild Serpent\u2019s heart.It passed right through the heart, leaving a cup sized wound on its heart.Beforehand, Liu Weiming and company had released their strongest magical powers together. All types of fireballs, water arrows, wind-blades techniques had smashed toward the serpent but could not break through the Wild Serpent\u2019s defense; nor, could it get through the creature\u2019s scales to cause even a trace of injury to its skin.Yet Nangong Liuyun could so easily dispatch it with merely a shot of golden double-edged sword tip.Like a knife cutting through tofu, it pierced straight through the very center of the Wild Serpent\u2019s heart, and left through its back.The Wild Serpent let out a loud painful howl, and then its enormous serpentine body segment by segment tumbled heavily to the ground. It produced a huge noise that lasted for a long while, as it kicked up a giant cloud of dust from the ground.When it fell to the ground, it eyes refused to close, and even in death, it seemed to still be holding grudges within its expression.The serpent head appear to be malevolent and terrifying.One- one move?But he just used only one move?And it was just a slight wave of his sleeves?Liu Weiming, Liu Ruohua, and the rest of their company had opened their eyes wide. Staring firmly at Nangong Liuyun, their mouth opened in an \u2018O\u2019 shape and could not say a word.They all knew that Nangong Liuyun was very powerful, but they couldn\u2019t have imagined he would be so strong to such an extent.Together, with the six of their strengths combined, they couldn\u2019t even wound the Wild Serpent, yet Nangong Liuyun with just a wave of his hand was able to kill the Wild Serpent.*grabbing feathers from a flying goose* \u2013 a Chinese idiom meaning to seize any opportunity.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Especially Liu Ruohua and another girl Li Wan, whose eyes, in addition to being filled to the brim with vigor, also emitted infatuated obsessiveness from their expressions when looking at Nangong Liuyun.\u201cCut it off.\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s appearance was picturesque, and his eyes were like a cold heavenly body; its depth appeared to let loose icy rays of indifference. His nonchalant voice commanded.The crisis had been removed, so everybody let loose sighs of relief.Liu Weiming wiped off a handful of perspiration from his forehead. Cheerfully and diligently, he ran up to carefully cut off the jade horn, and differentially presented it to Nangong Liuyun with both of his hands. Somewhat indecisively he once again hesitated as he said. \u201dYour highness, do you want this jade horn?\u201dWith regards to such a high level expert like his highness Prince Jin, this jade horn won\u2019t be considered very useful right?Nangong Liuyun lifted an eyebrow and shot him a quick glance.A pair of icy eyes, whose depth was able to mesmerize people, slowly made their intentions clear. Suddenly his scarlet, blood-red lips lifted into a devilishly alluring sneer.Liu Weiming\u2019s lungs felt as if they had been blocked by a boulder. An oppressive feeling, to the point where he couldn\u2019t breath.He cowered, trembling from head to toe and covering his chest in fear. He was unable to speak a single word.Nangong Liuyun threw him a faint, sideway glance and handed the jade horn to Su Luo. His eyebrows gently rose, carrying an limitless indulgent spoiling manner. His smile was full of tender feelings. \u201cIt looks quite nice, take it and play with it as you wish.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want it.\u201d Su Luo\u2019s pair of clear and bright eyes unenthusiastically looked at him. She nevertheless quite bluntly refused. \u201cWithout effort the rewards is undeserved.\u201dDon\u2019t want it! Liu Weiming and his group of people were practically weeping blood from their heart!Was this young lady\u2019s brain scared stupid? This was the Wild Serpent\u2019s jade horn. Its JADE HORN!Numerous people, in an attempt to obtain it, had risked their lives and died trying; but she had actually said that she didn\u2019t want it!In this case, it was even more true that constantly comparing oneself to others will only make one angry.How could his highness Prince Jin unexpectedly and biasedly treat her so well? Liu Ruohua bit her lower lips, nearly chewing the gums of her mouth to pieces. She was so envious that she nearly went insane.Nangong Liuyun still had the indulgent spoiling smile that filled his eyes. He gently rubbing her head. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want it then just throw it away. It\u2019s not as if it\u2019s some valuable stuff.\u201dThrow\u2026. throw it away?!?!In a split second, almost all of their eyes were concentrated on the jade horn lying on top of Su Luo\u2019s white slender palm. Their eyes clearly were expectantly waiting for her to throw it away without delay.Su Luo saw their eager expressions turn expectant to the point where they began to salivate. Her heart secretly felt that it was laughable, but her mouth only said. \u201cSince this being the case\u2026then well\u2026. I\u2019ll first help you take care of it. Whenever you think of it then I\u2019ll return it to you.\u201dNangong Liuyun was noncommittal.But once the words were spoken, Liu Weiming\u2019s type of people\u2019s disappointment was one that you could imagine.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s body showed a cold, indifferent intention. His expression was alienating and unsympathetic, coldly looking in disgust at Liu Weiming. \u201cInner core.\u201d .Liu Weiming\u2019s expression was as usual, however his heart was secretly whining about his bitter luck.With his highness Prince Jin\u2019s type of strength, how could he still cared about the inner monster core of the Wild Serpent? He originally thought to take advantage of the confusion to remove the inner core, because this was one of their tasked item.But since his highness Prince Jin mentioned it by name, how could he dare to even covet it silently?He dug out the inner core and after washing it cleanly, he placed it into a box made of white jade. Only then did Liu Weiming differentially presented it to Nangong Liuyun.Liu Weiming got up his nerves, took courage and weakly asked. \u201cYour highness, this inner core\u2026.Does your highness want to sell it?However, what made them envious was Nangong Liuyun again directly handed the small jade box to Su Luo.Keeping silent nevertheless provided the best answer.\u201cBut\u2026.but that is our tasked item, and also the Wild Serpent was drawn out by us!\u201d Liu Ruohua felt aggrieved and argued noisily in a loud voice.She felt it was really unfair.

What kind of thing is that?\u201dHe doted on little Luo Luo because she will be a part of his family. Who needed others to make thoughtless remarks? Was it because these people were tired of living?Liu Weiming threw at Liu Ruohua a harsh glare and said in a stern voice. \u201cWhat nonsense are you saying? If it weren\u2019t for his highness Prince Jin lending a hand, we would have already been completely wiped out. You still think that you can take the spoils of war for free?\u201dSu Luo secretly pondered: This Liu Weiming was actually not so foolish. He was able to *judge the hour and size up the situation*. Also his words left some leeway.If he didn\u2019t think of taking it for free, then was he going to use some means to exchange for it?Su Luo was shaking the inner core inside the jade box, with a smile yet not a smiling expression that contained some self-evident meaning.Liu Weiming with a cajoling smile, asked. \u201c Miss Su, this inner core is something that we have a reason to acquire and must insist on obtaining it. I don\u2019t know if you would be willing to be parted from it?\u201dHowever, before even waiting for Su Luo to reply, Nangong Liuyun directly seized the jade box. Then he picked up the sparkling and translucent inner core that could shone through flesh or bones and placed it into his mouth.\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201d At that moment, everybody was unable to make sense of what they were seeing and also, what was the intent behind his highness Prince Jin\u2019s act.However in the next moment, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s unyieldingly powerful palm took hold of the back of Su Luo\u2019s head. His other hand was wrapped around her slender waist. A dense and heavy shadow started to loom ever closer to Su Luo.\u201cOh\u2014\u2014\u201dIn the next instant Su Luo was being kissed, the type that was like an electric shock that rendered her limp and numbed her limbs when it swept through her entire body.The kiss had came too suddenly, it also seemed to have been timed perfectly.The surrounding area had become silent with only the gentle sound of the wind. Only the roars of dragons and whistles of the tigers sounded from afar, could be heard.Liu Ruohua had almost chewed her lips to a pulp.Li Wan\u2019s meaningful glare was about to bore a hole through Su Luo.With His highness Prince Jin\u2026How could this be possible!His highness Prince Jin was a matchless noble existence, he was liken to the gods of heaven in their nine pagoda palace. How could Su Luo this slut, be worthy of him!?Everyone had their eyes opened wide in disbelief.Yet at this moment, Nangong Liuyun was kissing Su Luo with reverence and was dragging it on lingeringly, unruffled by their sentiment.Thus the inner core of the Wild Serpent was delivered directly into Su Luo\u2019s mouth.Su Luo was choking on it and she started to cough, in a panic she pushed Nangong Liuyun away.Nangong Liuyun did not try to prevent her from doing it, he only heart-warmingly and tenderly watched the slightly panicked Su Luo.His mouth had hooked into a smugg and toying with someone for amusement kind of smiling expression.His star shaped eyes, below his sword like eyebrows held a devilish enchanting charm and seemed to be covered with a layer of haze. It was hard to make out, but it was still glistening and dazzling in a way that brightens up a room.Su Luo very fiercely glared at Nangong Liuyun, but those eyes gave off a beautiful mist: making people who see them founding it to be clever, and to give them a special feeling.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s wicked hands stroked toward the side of his own lips, wishing to use his fingers to continue caressing her abdomen.Su Luo had lifted her skirt and heavily stepped on his foot.Nangong Liuyun was loudly begging for mercy. His face brimming with a resplendent and careless smile. His bright and clear laughter was echoing around.Su Luo heard his laugh and was even more humiliated into anger.\u201cLuo girl, this time you are mistaken about this king\u2019s action.\u201d Nangong Liuyun immediately lifted up his hands in surrender, showing off his obedience and said. \u201cThe Wild Serpent\u2019s inner core\u2019s poisonous nature is extremely fierce, only by using this method will you be prevented from being harmed by it.\u201dIt seemed somewhat reasonable, Su Luo\u2019s beautiful eyes was moving around. She menacingly arched her eyebrows. \u201cThis time I\u2019ll let you go! Next time I\u2019ll pay more attention and take note of it!\u201dBetween the two of them, they seemed to be at *swords drawn and bows bent*. However in another\u2019s eyes it seemed as if they were having a flirtatious exchange, this scene was extremely ambiguous.Liu Weiming with an extremely disappointed look gazed at Su Luo.The inner core was already swallowed by her, it could never be taken back.In fact, how could he have known, that Nangong Liuyun since the beginning had calculated and planned for getting his hand on the Wild Serpent\u2019s inner core. Otherwise with regards to his personality why would he have let those people follow behind him?So till the end, no matter what, this inner core would eventually be delivered into Su Luo\u2019s mouth.Just at this time, from the distant horizon, waves of melodious heavenly music could be heard.*judge the hour and size up the situation* \u2013 figuratively meaning: to take stock of the situation.*swords drawn and bows bent* \u2013 figuratively meaning state of mutual hostility or at daggers drawn\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were divided into two rows and were quickly treading towards them in the air.A rush of wind, like the clear sound of moving water, brushed by. Swathes of captivating red cherry blossoms, floated down like a snowfall being carried by a breeze. Fluttering about and sprinkling behind sparkling and translucent snow-like petals. This scene was exceptionally beautiful and aesthetically pleasing.Everyone of them was clothed in a white silken dress, with straight and proper postures. Although their individual features were by no means considered beautiful: each and everyone of them was slender, simple, and neat. Too elegant and exquisite to be from this earth; their entire bodies seemed not to have been touched even a little by the vulgarness of the mortal world. They seemed like immortal beings flying by in a realm high above the common populace.Their ten fingers were slender, their waists were slim, and their footsteps were lithe and lively like an approaching wave of ageless fairies. They also looked like elfin spirits who just started to dance so beautifully that they could mesmerize one to the point of not being able to turn away.In their midst, there was a flowery litter so refined and lavish that it would stifle people into silence. It was carried by four maidens in a nimble and lively manner.In almost no time, this flowery litter gently landed. It steadily and securely halted in front of Nangong Liuyun.Such a grand show gave off an imposing loftiness that was the mark of high status. Who knew which divine place was the person in the flowery litter from? Su Luo\u2019s heart was secretly curious.She lifted her eyebrows and looked at Nangong Liuyun. She saw the corner of his mouth at this moment started to raise slightly. Inside that smile contained a gorgeous resplendent brilliance, as if the corner of his eyes and the tip of his eyebrows were both carrying a smiling expression.Su Luo could say with certainty that this person was Nangong Liuyun\u2019s old acquaintance. Moreover he was very happy to see this person.Su Luo\u2019s eyes faintly narrowed, but her face remained calm and collected. As time passed in her heart, she became even more interested in the person in the flowery litter.The flowery litter halted and was lowered. A slender, fair hand lifted itself to part the hanging curtain of green jade beads that surrounded the litter.From the interior, a fairy-like girl in the prime of her youth unhurriedly strolled out.One could only see her body, clothed in white that was as pure and holy as snow. Her dress stood against the wind with the skirt flying naturally like a winter snow fairy that drifted above the mundane world of man. Also there were splendid lights that radiated from her; its brilliance could blind someone.Her long hair dangled down to her ankles. The fine black hair danced carelessly along with the breeze, similar to an immortal fairy on the verge of leaving with the wind. She rode the wind evanescently, like a dying firework slowly fading into nothingness..Her eyelashes were just like butterfly wings, sweeping up and down while painted in a thick and rich black color. Her eyes resemble misty water droplets and maintained an unmatched grace and peacefulness. Her neck was delicate and graceful, her skin like crystalized amber with ice colored flesh and bones formed from jade.This was a woman at the pinnacle of feminine beauty, as if she was a beautiful spirit emerging from an orchid hidden away in an empty valley. It was as if thousands of living things collected their best features and integrated into her entire body: in an attempt to shame the people in front of her, into feeling the helpless nature of their inferiority.Currently, she stood filling the surrounding with her presence. Her lips were like a puckered red cinnabar, with a simple and neat complexion that displayed such a rare beauty. As she silently watched Nangong Liuyun, she seemed to be holding in a thread of light laughter.Her eyes seemed to be apathetic and alienating, but they were also covered in a layer of watery mist. Behind the watery mist was an expression full of tender-hearted feelings.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s always chilly and cruel icy eyes appeared to have become like a thin seam that cracked open. His beautiful eyes were pitch-black as ink and serene. With its hidden depth that held his source of demonic charm, his smile widened with an overflowing exuberance.He treated her very familiarly and also seemed to hold her very close and dear; completely different from the approach he used on Su Luo.\u201cWhy did you come?\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s snowy eyes appeared to show a slight concern.\u201cDidn\u2019t you also come?\u201d Her smile was very pretty. Her butterfly wing like eyelashes gently blinked, sweeping up and down. Her beautiful eyes were hazy like watery mist, I could still see the pity.The two of them laughed and spoke quietly as if in their own world and other people were just superfluous.Liu Ruohua stood by Su Luo\u2019s side, now the sneer on her face was very much oblivious. She attempted to cruelly taunt Su Luo. \u201cYou really think that his highness Prince Jin will like you? Did you not examine whether you match up to him.\u201dSu Luo\u2019s dark black eyes under the sunlight illuminated a clear reflection of cold, gorgeous color and luster. She threw a quick glance at her with a smile that was not a smiling expression. \u201cThe result of meddling in other people\u2019s business wouldn\u2019t be very wonderful.\u201dWhile speaking, her line of sight landed on Liu Ruohua\u2019s right hand that was cut off at the wrist and wrapped up in gauze.The depth of Liu Ruohua\u2019s eyes was full of a vicious hatred. But soon, she gave a cold and dark laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? The two of them are a true match, made by Heaven and arranged on Earth (1).

Despite the notion that you don\u2019t care about something, others seem to stubbornly insisted that you do. What\u2019s more, at the same time, they tried to deride you for not caring.\u201cOpen your eyes and look closely. That person is the Jade Lake Palace\u2019s young princess. People call her Jade Lake\u2019s fairy. Regardless of whether its innate talent, accomplishments in martial arts, or even family background, none of it is something you a good-for-nothing can compare. You still don\u2019t get it right? In everyone\u2019s eyes those two were made for one another like a pair of Jade Annulus. There won\u2019t exist a even more suited pair then them.\u201dLiu Ruohua\u2019s eyes were filled to the brim with maliciousness and a mocking disdain that seemed to take joy in calamity and delight in disaster (1). If she couldn\u2019t be with him, then Su Luo, this lump of mud, even more shouldn\u2019t think about it!\u201cReally?\u201d Su Luo\u2019s expression was indifferent, apparently unconcerned.She nonchalantly seized up the the immortal fairy not far from her. This was the most suitable companion in the legendary rumor?They stood facing each other, and it seemed like a painter\u2019s masterpiece of being in love and inseparable in the human world inked on a picture scroll.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s phoenix eyes were narrowed, his features were picturesque with red alluring lips. A head of fine, jet-black hair poured down in torrents. A faint, flirtatiously fiendish charm exuded from his entire persons, which was currently giving off a very languid air.Clothed in a dark, mysterious robe traced with hidden patterns of bright embroidery. The hem of his brocade robe was lifted gently by gusts of wind. It was elegantly and gracefully dancing in the breeze like a brightly-colored butterfly.The Jade Lake fairy\u2019s features were fine and slender like sculpted gems. Her lips were a frosty cherry color and emitted a bright, glossy sheen. Her neck was delicate and graceful. Her skin was like ice that glowed with the luster of gems. Dressed in an snow-white, inviting skirt she gave the appearance of a simple and elegant immortal with a manner that was exceedingly untouched and above the common people.One individual was handsome and outstandingly talented. The other individual was devastatingly beautiful capable of causing the downfall of a city or state. One was devilish charming and the other rose from the perfection of nature.Although Liu Ruohua was annoying, but her words were not false. Nangong Liuyun and the Jade Lake fairy were indeed the perfect match like a pair of Jade Annulus made by Heaven and arranged by Earth (2).Su Luo folded both her arms and narrowed her beautiful eyes slightly. Just in this way, she unconcernedly stood in her original place for a long time, motionless while quietly watching them.Currently, it seemed as if suddenly Nangong Liuyun just thought of something. He glanced back and beckoned to Su Luo.However, Su Luo only raised her dainty, slender eyebrows, returning his look with a smile that was not a smile.What was the meaning of this? Does he think that merely by summoning her with just a wave, that she would just go to him? Was she, Su Luo, in his eyes just so contemptible?That Jade Lake\u2019s holy maiden laughingly looked over. Her shapely eyebrows resembled crescent moons. The black painted eyebrows against the backdrop of her white powdered face, gave off a gem like luster of someone inseparably in love.Her shoulder seem to be carved like a sculpture with a naturally balanced waist. Her flesh was glowing like crystalized amber and had a serene presence like that of a secluded orchid. A pair of limpidly bright and intelligent eyes watched Su Luo.It was so beautiful that it was practically earth-shaking and made people suffocate. It made people feel inferior such that they were unable to bear it, thus lowering their head in terror.The corner of Su Luo\u2019s mouth rose slightly in welcome and betrayed not a bit of weakness in any regard. A pair of beautiful pure and deep eyes was so clear as to be moving, as if it can see through everything.Considering her imposing manner, why would Su Luo who walk out from the middle of foul wind and bloody rain (3) for more than ten years be afraid of her?The two of them silently looked eye to eye.For a while, the surrounding area was quiet, and the spectacle seemed to hold a little awkwardness.However just at this time, an unforeseen event was suddenly born!Suddenly from the depths of the mountain range came an extremely sharp burst of chirping. As this sound pierced through the sky, it resembled gold grinding on stone. To hear it made people\u2019s eardrum sting with extreme pain. A buzzing sound echoed through the area. Their heartbeats throbbed violently with the blood vessels bursting open so energetically that it caused people to almost faint.At this moment, everyone was shocked. Everyone all looked toward the direction where the sound came from.In the distance a mysterious force seemed to circulate. The earth and sky radiated with brilliance. All of a sudden a flaming red-colored lightning streaked across the horizon, and the flash quickly passed.Afterwards, vast stretches of flame soared like a raging blaze emitting resplendent light. It was as if it desired to envelope chunks of the entire sky and burn them fiercely.\u201cPhoenix! Fire Phoenix!\u201d Nobody knew who pointed to the horizon at the brutal image that quickly flashed by, while excitedly shrieking loudly.\u201cDragon! There is also a divine dragon!\u201d Again someone else immediately followed with a excited shout.1) took joy in calamity and delight in disaster \u2013 Chinese idiom for to rejoice in other people\u2019s misfortune / Schadenfreude.2) made by Heaven and arranged by Earth \u2013 Chinese idiom for of an ideal/perfect match made in heaven or to be made for one another.3) foul wind and bloody rain \u2013 Chinese idiom for reign of terror or carnage.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Who would have thought that their silhouettes would actually simultaneously appear today?The so-called dragon that Su Luo had to kill was only an Armored Back Dragon. That kind of dragon and this divine dragon of legend were fundamentally two different concepts.The appearance of the Phoenix and Divine Dragon excited everyone greatly, but their current situation was extremely unfavorable.This was because the bloody battle being carried out by the two divine beasts was causing trouble for the magical beasts in the Sunset Mountain Range below them.At this moment, almost all the magical beasts were wildly dashing outwards in order to avoid any troublesome accidental encounter and attempting to keep away from the two divine beasts locked in battle.Currently, there were countless number of magical beasts violently charged towards them at full speed like the tide. It was aggressive and impossible to block.\u201cThis situation isn\u2019t good.\u201d Nangong Liuyun\u2019s tempting purple eyes held a dense coldness.\u201cIndeed, a wave of magical beasts is coming.\u201d Jade Lake\u2019s holy maiden answered indifferently.\u201cA wave of magical beasts!\u201d The expressions on each and every other person\u2019s had changed greatly, and their eyes were filled with terror.Even though they had never experienced a magical beast stampede, they had already been warned by their teachers about how terrifying it was.Whenever a magical beast wave appeared, martial artists at the scene would almost always barely escape, but at the same time, this fortuitous encounter was an occurrence that happened once in a century.Because whenever a magical beast wave happened, a peerless treasure would always inevitably appear.It was extremely possible that what those two almost-extinct divine beasts were fighting over, was a heavenly treasure.\u201cAt the center of the forest\u2026\u201d The Jade Lake\u2019s holy maiden\u2019s beautiful eyes were indifferent as she suddenly turned her head. She wished to continue talking, but then stopped. She tilted her head as her beautiful eyes exchanged meaningful looks with Nangong Liuyun.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s charming eyes looked at Su Luo, and the bright radiance in the depths of his eyes dimmed for a split second.Every time a magical beast wave occurred, although it was dangerous, it was still a rare, hard to come by opportunity.If it was in the past, he would naturally go onwards and explore. However, the one next to him was Su Luo who had no spiritual power. He could guarantee his own safety if he had to withdraw, but he could not say that she would certainly come out unscathed.Su Luo had on a completely carefree expression. With her clear eyes that could vividly see everything, she casually glanced at him. \u201cYou can go, don\u2019t worry about me.\u201dAfter saying that, a trace of loneliness suddenly flashed through her heart.Even though Liu Ruohua was hateful, what she had said was right. With her current strength, she didn\u2019t even have the qualification to stand by his side.He and the Jade Lake\u2019s holy maiden were the ones in their own world. Their strengths were appropriately equivalent and their identities were compatible. And she, seemed to be an disregarded tiny insignificant existence that could only look up towards them from an extremely low point of view in their presence.This kind of feeling was extremely unpleasant.A trace of sympathy flashed through Nangong Liuyun\u2019s clear and intelligent eyes. He rubbed her little head. \u201cHow can I not care about you. What nonsense.\u201dAfter finished speaking, he turned his head and smiled towards the Jade Lake\u2019s holy maiden. \u201cBe careful. No matter what, a mere treasure is not as important as your life.\u201dHe said it in a warm and gentle tone of voice, completely unlike the ice-cold cruel way he uses with others.\u201cThank you for the warning.\u201d Jade Lake\u2019s holy maiden\u2019s pure eyes were touching and her faint laugh was like a cool breeze gently passing by; without any startling ripples or extremely varying emotions.As light as water, her gaze gently landed on Su Luo\u2019s face, yet a terrifying piercing cold feeling suddenly went down Su Luo\u2019s back?Is this woman\u2026really as she\u2019s portrayed herself: like lifeless water? Without sorrow or joy, and free from mortal vulgarity?A hint of suspicion flashed through the depths of Su Luo\u2019s heart as her heart sensed a sort of bad premonition.Su Luo did not dare to say that her sixth sense was infallible, but it had never been wrong for all these years.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He picked up Su Luo and whirled his body around, flying towards the nearby small wooden house on top of a tree.Liu Ruohua and her companions imitated Nangong Liuyun one after another. Everyone of them used both their hands and feet together to quickly climb up the millennium old ancient trees. They tightly hugged the tree branches, hopping that they could escape this wave of magical beasts.Jade Lake\u2019s fairy turned her body around and looked toward Nangong Liuyun with a detached expression. She saw his silhouette carrying Su Luo in his arms. Her elegant and vibrantly beautiful eyes seem to be covered in a layer of watery mist, nobody understood the meaning hidden in the depth of her eyes that were as pitch-black as ink.Her face lacked expression, and her red lips slightly opened into an arc, evoking a trace of an impassive smile. Her jade arms clenched at her thin, misty green, full-length, muslin gown that swept the floor as if it was leaving behind a trail of running water. Immediately, the light muslin danced in the breeze like fireworks that become faintly discernible before fading into nothingness.The Jade Lake\u2019s fairy whirled and immediately flew away in a graceful and naturally relaxed manner.Around a dozen maidservants by her side were shrouded in icy-cold expressions as they coldly launched their gazes at Su Luo. Soon after, they too, followed her and flew away.Su Luo\u2019s thin eyebrows hesitantly knitted. Her intuition told her that this Jade Lake\u2019s fairy smile was somewhat\u2026 mysterious?Sure enough, just when she had flown a short distance away, numerous vultures suddenly surrounded them in a circle.The vulture king seem to be fixated on the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy, and each maneuver was filled with malicious ruthlessness.The vulture king was a seventh ranked magical beast. It was also a flying type magical beast; compared to similarly ranked land type magical beast, it was even more difficult to handle.At this time, Jade Lake\u2019s fairy\u2019s circumstances appeared to be extremely dangerous.The vulture king was in hot pursuit of the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy, as it followed tightly behind her. It seemed that the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy was about to lose her life under the sharp claws of the vulture king\u2014\u2014Nangong Liuyun\u2019s star shaped eyes held a complicated light, and his expression fluctuated between brightness and darkness, while being profoundly mysterious.Suddenly, he hugged Su Luo to him, and left a passionate kiss on her bright and clean jade like forehead. His serious expression condensed into an austere stare directed toward Su Luo. \u201cBe good. Just stay here and wait for me. Don\u2019t go anywhere else.\u201dBefore the words completely left his mouth, and without waiting for Su Luo\u2019s reply, his body had already elevated to midair. Fast as lightning, he rushed toward the place where the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy was.\u201cNangong Liuyun you keep on saying that you like me, but when all\u2019s said and done, in your heart she is still more important.\u201dThe corner of Su Luo\u2019s mouth rose into a faint and bitter laugh such that even she did not realize. A poignant and acerbic meaning was mixed within her bitter laughter.Now Su Luo finally understood why the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy was smiling before with such a hidden meaning.This woman, her appearance and martial arts, were both viewed as at the top. In addition, her sophisticated shrewdness and scheming was also very deep. And on top of that her extraordinary family background\u2026 Gods were truly generous in their treatment of her, providing her with a gifted advantage.As expected, this kind of talented person was really Nangong Liuyun\u2019s perfect match. How could she, Su Luo, the unfavored, good-for-nothing, common woman from a Great General\u2019s Manor be considered as something?Su Luo coldly smiled, set aside all her negative mood and started to size up the small tree house.The small tree house was very clean, roughly about ten square meters of space. Inside the tree house, besides the woven mat spread on the floor there was nothing else.Su Luo motionlessly and quietly sat in the small tree house.Perhaps it was because of the loneliness of a person being isolated in the way she was, but Su Luo\u2019s thoughts had a strong feeling of disappointment.In her previous life, she had been a renown assassin, who was the cause of the sentencing and the obliteration of numerous people. The vast majority of the people were just a mark to her.But ever since having arrived in this world, she frequently felt as though she was being thwarted by the gods.Here she was, only a member of the ordinary people. She could rely on her previous incarnation\u2019s skills to defeat a first ranked Su Wan. However, if she were to genuinely battle it out with the second ranked Su Xi, she may not necessarily be able to win.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But from within her smile, Su Luo could clearly read her state of mind; and it showed a kind of\u2014\u2014disdain.She had exuded an air of contempt. As if to say, just by a slight move of her finger; she could squish Su Luo like a bug.This type of impression made Su Luo feel extremely out of sorts.Within her heart a raging fighting spirit had been ignited!She, Su Luo was not a good-for-nothing; on the contrary, she was a super gifted genius with an affiliation for three elemental systems. If she was only given a chance, her future accomplishments would not be any bit inferior to others!Su Luo made a fist!This time, she must find dragon\u2019s blood in order to open up her space element. This way, her wood and fire dual systems wouldn\u2019t be firmly suppressed, giving her the opportunity to start cultivating.Otherwise, no matter how great her innate talent, it would still be useless.The person she was right now could be considered the richest individual under the heavens. There were mountains of gold and silver within her grasp, but, up until now, she couldn\u2019t find the keys to open the door. She could only gaze at the ocean and lament her inadequacy (1) from outside the door.Time passed slowly, bit by bit.However, Nangong Liuyun hadn\u2019t returned yet.She was not sure what had happened, because all of the magical beasts had run away. For at this time, the surroundings were very still and quiet. The stillness was strangely eerie, like the calm before the storm.Suddenly, the storm winds began to rise.The powerful gale whistled and screamed with blasts that made the entire earth tremble. The small tree house swayed and tottered in the wind\u2019s midst.Su Luo leaned forward and looked out the window.Laid before her was the scene, of a tornado as black as ink, moving rapidly while roaring towards her exact locationIt was similar to a giant creature that extended its bloody mouth wide open like a sacrificial bowl (2), with thunderous snarls, while baring its fangs and brandishing its claws (3). It was as if both heaven and earth allowed it to do whatever it pleases. Nobody could possibly prevent it.The tornado came hurtling past.The small wooden house teetered on the verge of collapse.In order to not be blown away flying, Su Luo tightly clutched a pillar.Suddenly, Su Luo became aware that under her foot she sensed bouts of earth quaking and the mountains shaking (4). She looked out the tiny window and couldn\u2019t help be somewhat flabbergasted.She discovered that her entire person, oh, it should be more accurate to say the entire small tree house had actually been lifted from the ground.Very quickly, the small tree house broke away from the thousand year old ancient tree trunk. It was uprooted and the tornado swept it up into midairHowever it could be deemed fortunate that the small tree house hasn\u2019t collapsed and fallen apart, rather it still stood firmly.But still, Su Luo\u2019s complexion had turned somewhat pale.She visually estimated that her current distance from the ground was roughly about a hundred meters. If she was to fall from such a height, she would become nothing but torn body and crushed bones (5) not even crumbs would remain.She have yet to cultivate flying techniques. If she fell down, then there was only one word\u2026death.Su Luo aggravatedly scratched her head.That damned Nangong Liuyun! He only knew how to be concerned about the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy, while leaving her as he pleased in a random spot at the original place.And also that damned tornado! Why sweep up the small wooden house where she was? Obviously there were still other small tree houses over there\u2026.Like this, she could also be chosen? In the end what kind of luck was this? Su Luo was hit by a moment of extreme speechlessness\u2026.The surrounding gale of the tornado rages on; however in the eyes of the tornado the breeze was still, and waves were quiet (6). At present, Su Luo sat in the faintly fluttering small tree house, just as if she was sitting in a hot air balloon.Now if someone was to see this, they would certainly be stupefied such that their chin would drop to the ground.Because the people of this world had never seen a house flying in the sky\u2026.Could this be considered the first time since the beginning of history?Just when Su Luo had became all too nervous, suddenly, a tiny spherical body was thrown into the small wooden house. It tumbled to the floor and rolled about until it finally stopped by Su Luo\u2019s feet.This spherical object\u2026.Su Luo meticulously looked it up and down. In her heart a trace of misgivings flashed through, it looked like a type of egg, moreover it was a very large egg.Could it be that even flying in the sky, she could still pick up an egg?Was it possible for the mother bird to be flying and laying an egg at the same time?At that moment, three black lines appeared on Su Luo\u2019s forehead.1) gaze at the ocean and lament her inadequacy \u2013 idiom: to feel powerless and incompetent (to perform a task)2) bloody mouth wide open like a sacrificial bowl \u2013 idiom: ferocious mouth of beast of prey; greedy exploiter; rapacious aggressor.3) baring its fangs and brandishing its claws \u2013 idiom: to make threatening gestures.4) earth quaking and the mountains shaking \u2013 could also mean: tremendous battle5) torn body and crushed bones \u2013 figuratively meaning to die horribly; to sacrifice one\u2019s life6) breeze was still, and waves were quite \u2013 idiom: tranquil environment; all is quiet; a dead calm (at sea)\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Su Luo\u2019s attention was, without exception, completely concentrated upon the egg.This egg was no less than the size of a soccer ball. The outer shell was white and glossy with colored rays of light like the luster of gems shining through. Occasionally a stream of light would also streak across the top.It gave off a dense and mysterious air.Suddenly, rustling noises could be heard from inside the egg, as if the small creature within was trying to break out of its shell and enter the world.Su Luo was immediately struck dumb.Impossible, right? How could this egg, against all expectations, just happen to hatch out of the blue like this in the sky?However, as if in response to her amazement, the top of the egg promptly split open and a thin crack appeared on the surface. Afterwards, the crack become wider and wider until crisp bump, bump, bump noises could be heard.Su Luo held her breath in rapt attention and her eyes opened wide while watching the spectacle before herShe saw, from the fragmented pieces of eggshell on the topmost part of the egg, a tiny head covered with some shattered pieces of eggshells, slowly but surely make its way out. It naively, adorably and unsteadily, rotated its tiny head.What kind of creature is this? Su Luo had never seen one like it before.But this little thing looked too adorable.A round puffy little head, simple and strong, that was absolutely adorable. Both of its eyes were closed tightly like a newborn, the corner of its mouth was dribbling out a lot of tiny little bubbles.It seemed somewhat dejected because, apart from its head, the rest of its body was still in the eggshell.She could only see its eyes were still closed. It had a rosy red moist little mouth which was very small, but its nibbling speed was very fast.The little thing looked like it was nibbling on a large piece of round bread. It first nibbled away at the eggshell near its mouth, then slowly extended to the surrounding area.It finally finished eating the entire eggshell, then used its nose to sniff around as if looking for something else.Throughout the entire process, its eyes remain closed, giving it a charmingly innocent impression.Su Luo\u2019s heart became curious. What is this little thing that just broke through its eggshell looking for?In the midst of her curious musings, the little thing took some shaky steps with its thin, delicate legs; and swayed drunkenly about, tottered to the side of Su Luo\u2019s feet. It extended two small paws and grabbed the lower corner of Su Luo\u2019s clothing. Its small body trembled and quivered while climbing into her lap\u2026.The whole time, Su Luo\u2019s body was completely stiff. She stared at this little guy with an extremely dumbfounded expression.At the moment, this little guy\u2019s plump and chubby little body was already laying on its back in her lap. Its little belly moved up and down with every breath, eyes still closed as it started to make tiny snoring noises.Its pair of paws still firmly clasped a piece of Su Luo\u2019s clothing. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn\u2019t pry its paws open.This\u2026 this little guy was a little too unselfconscious. Wasn\u2019t approaching her out of its own accord already acting a little too familiar?Does it think that she is its mother?Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh. Three strips of black lines appeared on Su Luo\u2019s forehead. Drip, drip drip. Her cold sweat poured down.Her eyes were fixed on this little guy that trustingly came of its own accord. She meticulously and carefully looked at it up and down.Speaking of which, what kind of species is this little guy?Say, is it a dog? It looks a little like it could be, but it didn\u2019t have fur.Say, is it a baby dragon? However, it was born to look like a plump ball with a foolish, blank expression that was too adorable. Entirely unlike the image of a divine dragon that would bare fangs and brandish claws (2) with a terrible and fierce malevolence.The most important thing is this: that egg just now, how did it roll to here in the first place? Was it caused by man or was it the Will of Heaven?Also, her small wooden house, how did it remain intact when it was in the middle of a roaring tornado? This was simply too unbelievable.In the midst of Su Luo\u2019s contemplation, the small wooden house suddenly began to tremble. She was shaken until the sky spun and the earth went around (3). Her head was woozy and her vision was spinning, making her dizzy. Finally, she felt the entire small wooden house fall straight down.\u201cOh damn it!?\u201d Su Luo secretly cursed in her heart as she firmly held on to the small wooden house.Next to her ear, the wind whistled loudly.Right now the situation was even more terrifying than being in a falling elevator!It was through great difficulty that she, Su Luo, had once again been reborn. How could she fall and die again, in this era?1) indulging in flights of fancy \u2013 Chinese idiom: to let one\u2019s imagination run wild; to have a bee in one\u2019s bonnet; unrealistic utopian fantasy2) bare fangs and brandish claws \u2013 Chinese idiom: to make threatening gestures3) sky spins and the earth goes around \u2013 Chinese idiom: giddy with one\u2019s head spinning, figuratively meaning huge changes in the world.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

During the descent, although the small wooden house was thrown about until it shattered into tiny pieces, Su Luo, a step ahead, had already rolled out of it hugging the little guy tightly.Su Luo\u2019s movements were very nimble. She tucked the defenseless little guy next to her bosom; used both hands to grab a tree branch; and light as a feather, floated past. Her movements were graceful, lithe and agile.Because of her ability to quickly dodge, when the shattered pieces of wood from the little wooden house fell down, it was unable to cause her the slightest bit of harm.However, this did not mean she was safe yet. Quite the opposite, there were other dangers that awaited her.Currently, not far from Su Luo\u2019s location, there was an extremely bitter battle taking place.One was a creature that looked very similar to the little guy; the divine dragon that Liu Ruohua and company previously shouted about.As for the other one, it could only be the phoenix bird, burning from head to foot in a raging inferno of flames.The two were fighting against each other to the point where it seemed that both sides would suffer from this winless situation.Dragon? Suddenly a thought flashed through Su Luo\u2019s mind.Her brain suddenly light up, she ruefully hit herself in the head.She had suffered untold hardships (1) to arrive at the Sunset Mountain Range, eliminated countless difficulties, and all for what? It was, of course, for dragon blood!Since the one that was just fighting was a dragon, then \u2026.. Su Luo\u2019s gaze landed on the charmingly naive little guy who was comfortably asleep in her arms.This guy should also be a dragon right? That\u2019s right. There could be no mistake. This was definitely a dragon! From before\u2026 that soccer ball sized egg was absolutely a dragon egg.While she can\u2019t get the divine dragon\u2019s blood, but this little divine dragon\u2026..was currently in her hands!hey, hey!The corner of Su Luo\u2019s mouth brought forth a sinister smile. This was indeed a perversion of \u201csearching everywhere, far and wide,\u201d given how easy it was to find.She realized that her luck was so good that it could only be described as defying Heaven\u2019s Will. She never expected that a dragon\u2019s egg would just coincidentally be dropped in front of her. Moreover it also spontaneously hatched. And what\u2019s more, it even reflexively volunteered to climb into her lap.Su Luo started to smile with pride.Her slender finger poked the little divine dragon in her arms. The corner of the little dragon\u2019s mouth began to froth and bubble as it, sleepily wheezes and snored in a sound sleep. It was completely unaware that it was being marked by someone.If the mother dragon knew about Su Luo\u2019s thoughts, it really would want to vomit blood.Just when her little dragon, that she had nurtured with great difficulty, was about to hatch, she ran into a phoenix that was seeking revenge. She could do nothing, and had no other choice than to randomly select a tiny place to store her little dragon egg.But how could she have known, that the random small wooden house she had selected was actually harboring such a person. Furthermore, by sheer chance, what the person needed most was dragon\u2019s blood?If the mother dragon knew of this, it very likely would become insane with anger. What was this called? This was practically called voluntarily delivering her child to the door of a tyrant and begging for it to be oppressed.Su Luo took out a dagger from within her boots, which glittered like frost and snow, radiating deathly cold rays of light.However, right when Su Luo was pondering where she ought to start cutting, the little divine dragon unexpectedly woke up.It opened its misty, watery little eyes; and its little paws started to rub the blurred drowsiness out of them. Its little face was filled with confusion.This stupidly cute expression, seemed to be able to enthrall any person with its adorable, bewitching sense of cuteness.Naturally when she saw it, even Su Luo\u2019s iron-hard heart also softened.Suddenly, the adorable little dragon opened its round eyes wide and instantly fixed its gaze onto Su Luo.Su Luo also silently gazed back at it.When it saw Su Luo, the little divine dragon seemed to become very excited. Its little mouth opened, issuing forth a sweet-sounding dragon cry.\u201cWeng\u2014\u2014\u201dThe dragon cry rang out next to Su Luo\u2019s ear, jolting her forehead with extreme pain and giving her a splitting headache.But also because of the sound of this dragon cry, her plans had been ruined.1) suffered untold hardships \u2013 Chinese idiom: trials and tribulations; with difficulty; after some effort.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only to see its treasured little baby was actually laying in the arms of a person from the insignificant human race. Moreover, that human was even wielding a dagger and making motions towards the baby with it!Oh, my god!The mother dragon let out a ear-piercing sound that resonated loud and clear. The sound volume blasted straight through the clouds into the sky.The mother dragon thought that it would be best to immediately release a dragon\u2019s breath to burn Su Luo to a crisp, until there would almost be nothing left. When the transformation to ashes was complete, the residual would float away light as a feather.However, Su Luo\u2019s good luck rested on the dragon hostage she held in her hands as this placed her in an advantageous position. Therefore, none of the mother dragon\u2019s long range attacks could be used.The mother dragon was afraid that while wounding the rat, it would hit the fragile jade vase.So, it refrained from shooting at the rat for fear of breaking vases (1).Suddenly, Su Luo saw the enormously large body of a divine dragon leaped in her direction. Such an awe-inspiring, dignified, powerful dragon jolted her heart and caused it to throb violently.A startled expression passed through her eyes. It was too late to think clearly. She hugged the adorable little dragon close, turned around, and just ran.This was definitely an unconscious action.Run, run, run\u2014\u2014Su Luo knew that if the mother dragon was to catch up to her, any hope of getting dragon\u2019s blood would be dashed.Not only that, her life would cease to exist beneath the flying claws of the violently raging mother dragon.The divine dragon\u2019s bursts of dragon roar, shocked Su Luo, making her blood rush forth. The power of the dragon roar was deafening, like a magnificent army with thousands of men and horses (2) surging forward.While the divine dragon was chasing after Su Luo to kill her, the fire phoenix behind was also chasing after the divine dragon. It was also because of the fire phoenix\u2019s interference that Su Luo had a slight chance to escape.It appeared like a blazing path that pierced the vast sky. Ten thousand thunder claps started to echo across the sky, its power to destroy also contained an endless murderous intent.Su Luo while running also took the time to look back. She only saw the dragon\u2019s malevolently cruel and vengeful expression. The light of bloodlust shining out from the dragon\u2019s eyes. The soccer ball sized scales glittered like snow and frost as if each piece contained an inexhaustible strength.\u201cDamn it!\u201d cursed Su Luo. Her expression changed slightly when she saw the distance between the divine dragon and herself shrinking.The divine dragon had long ago become enraged. If she was captured by it then her end would absolutely be quite tragic.Su Luo accelerated her pace. Her footsteps seemed to give birth to the wind. With powerful jumps, she rushed forward without looking back.Su Luo\u2019s heart was very agitated.With her current speed, she was sure that halfway down the road, the dragon will overtake her.How can she escape from it?The divine dragon chased her until she had to go up to Heaven or down to Hades (3) fleeing and still couldn\u2019t escape.In the meanwhile, the little guy in her arms was also restless. It apparently felt that they were playing a game. It stretched out its round, plump head and joined with its mother dragon in issuing dragon roars up here, down there (4).Su Luo was frustrated to death. She half threatened and half menacingly patted its head. \u201cDo not call out!\u201dThe adorable little dragon did not seem to understand the meaning of Su Luo\u2019s words. Its round, circular eyes were full of confusion. However, after seeing Su Luo\u2019s cruel and sinister expression, it weakly withdrew its neck and silently contracted its little head back into Su Luo\u2019s arm.However, after a short while, the little dragon reverted to its old ways. The little head once again came out to explore.\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to yell, go back!\u201d Su Lu said while tapping its head. The little dragon once again did what it was told and very obediently pulled back into Su Luo\u2019s arms.As a result, every time the little dragon would spring out, Su Luo would flick it back in.It would come out to explore and then once again be bounced back in.Due to this back and forth, the adorable little dragon was under the impression that Su Luo was playing a game with it. Ha, ha, ha, it laughingly chortled while playing along happily.Later on, Su Luo was too lazy to poke the little dragon so it became upset. The little dragon started to wail awooo awoo loudly. An expression of being wronged appeared on its little face, its eyes were gleaming with tears.The three black lines on Su Luo\u2019s forehead once again appeared.All she wanted was a little dragon\u2019s blood. It should have been easy, right? In front she had an adorable little dragon stirring up trouble, behind she had a large divine dragon pursuing closely and unwilling to let go\u2026The divine dragon\u2019s speed was like lightning.

The divine dragon was so infuriated, that both its eyes were red with anger. However it was still afraid of injuring the little divine dragon, so it won\u2019t dare to fire off a Dragon\u2019s Breath.The large divine dragon\u2019s eyes continued to burn with flames of fury. The huge dragon tail resembled a chain of thickly linked iron swinging dangerously around. In one spot it had swept, it snapped all the forest trees within ten meters of its body.Flying leaves swirled in the air as a giant cloud of dust rose.Although Su Luo was not swept up by the dragon tail, she was hit by flying fragments of wood.A piece of broken wood ruthlessly knocked against her back. When it did, Su Luo felt as if her back was about to split wide open. She felt as if a huge boulder had been pressing down on her chest, so heavily that made it nearly impossible for her to breath.She felt that the qi and blood in her entire body rolled over in waves. A sweet coppery taste materialized in her throat. Unable to keep it in, she sprayed out a stream of blood.\u201cPhoo\u2014\u2014\u201d The soles of Su Luo\u2019s feet swayed, almost unable to stand.Just at this time, a sense of an impending crisis rushed through her mind.This was caused by the divine dragon behind her, who was unexpectedly preparing to unleash Dragon\u2019s Breath. An awe-inspiring radiance streaked by, and the brilliant rays were like sharp swords launched toward Su Luo.Su Luo\u2019s complexion had immediately undergone a major change.She spared no effort (1) in rushing towards the tilting thorns, her speed was so quick that only an incomplete shadow was left behind.That slash of intense radiance was like the tip of a double-edged sword, that directly turned the trees within a hundred meters ahead of it into ashes. Even the ground was completely split open leaving a terrifying large fissure in the earth. The soil and mud were also turned into fine dust.Su Luo dangerously avoided this killing move. Yet an icy chill emerged from her heart, and her forehead was instantly covered in cold sweat.She was almost at the end of her rope and was barely hanging in by a thread.But fortunately, at this time the fire phoenix had already caught up with the divine dragon.Consequently, these two divine beasts\u2019 blood feud resumed. This provided Su Luo with a little opportunity that she could take advantage of.If the divine dragon did not fear of trouble in the rear (2), Su Luo knew she simply would not have been its opponent. Very likely she would have already been slashed to death by the divine dragon\u2019s claws without being able to run for more than several hundred meters.However in the recent past Su Luo seemed to be cared for by the goddess of fortune.Against all expectations, on the back heels of this divine dragon, the fire phoenix followed up and continued its battle with the dragon. Moreover, this fire phoenix had narrow-mindlessly (3) taken advantage of its difficulties. As a result the divine dragon had no other alternative than to face Su Luo with hateful regret while gnashing its teeth (4).Whenever the divine dragon was about to kill off Su Luo, the fire phoenix that had been following close behind would come out and cause a disturbance. This kind of situation repeated itself again and again, enraging the divine dragon until it nearly spat out blood.But now, even Su Luo also had a kind of urge to spit out blood.It\u2019s over!When Su Luo saw the barren cliffs and the precipitous rock faces ahead, she immediately wanted to start to cry but lacked the tears to begin.At this time, all three directions moving forward were blocked by an overhanging cliff and behind her the mother dragon pursued feverishly, unwilling to let go. Now she basically had nowhere to escape!What to do? Could it be that her hands were practically tied and set to be captured?Out of the question! Even if she was to return the adorable little dragon now, the divine dragon will absolutely not let her get away.At present she still had not arrived at the dead-end road, so surely there was still another chance to save herself.Sure enough, heaven never barred one\u2019s way (5).Su Luo\u2019s sharp eyes saw a perfectly straight dark green creeper vine hanging down the cliff.Su Luo gave it a few tugs and found that this rope-like creeper vine was apparently frequently used by people before her. She need not worry about the firmness aspect of the vine.It seems as if the Heavens really don\u2019t want me to die!Su Luo\u2019s heart immediately rejoiced.She tucked the adorable little dragon into her bosom, afterwards she used her hands to nimbly grab the creeper vine. She used both her hands and feet to rapidly climb up the tall overhanging cliff. It took her less than a quarter of the hour to reach the top.On top of the cliff was a flat plane covered by a meadow. A gentle breeze passed by and rustled a tidy area of the field into a rising and falling motion, like a jade green wave that rippled. This sight gave her the sensation of an untroubled heart, pleased spirit (6).Standing on top of the precipice and gazing into the distance. Su Luo could clearly see the feverish fight between the divine dragon and the fire phoenix not far way.It was as if they had claimed an area of heaven and earth for themselves.

Using one hand, she brought out the adorable little dragon from within her embrace while the other hand searched within her bosom for the jade box that she had prepared.The Celestial Spirit water she stole from Su Manor and the Spatial Grass she received from Nangong Liuyun were both stored in the jade box.The jade box had the ability to keep things fresh that resembled refrigeration. Even if the Spatial Grass was stored for a few decades, when it\u2019s taken out later, it would be as tender and fresh as if it had just been picked.However, at this moment, a look of astonishment flashed through Su Luo\u2019s eyes!Where was the jade box? Where was her jade box? Su Luo\u2019s face immediately become puzzled and unconvinced.She remembered very clearly that when she was alone in the small wooden house before, she had personally taken out the jade box to check. How could it have disappeared?Did she lose it when she fell down the ancient tree?Not possible. She clearly remembered the jade box was in her arms when she tucked the adorable little dragon in there, too. How could it have suddenly disappeared between that time and now?Could it be that she had dropped it on top of the overhanging cliff? Su Luo looked down and began to search everywhere from left to right and in all directions. Ultimately, she ended up laying on the ground and rummaging through the soil, but she still could not find a trace of the jade box.This could truly be called\u2026having picked up a sesame seed while losing a watermelon!Su Luo just wanted to cry but lacked the tears.Undoubtedly the dragon\u2019s blood is right in front of her, but the Spatial grass and the Celestial Spirit water had actually disappeared. What could be worse?While Su Luo was in the midst of dismay and going around in circles, the adorable little dragon from the beginning had been looking up at Su Luo with a pair of eyes which contained a bewildered and foolishly stupid expression. Its thin and delicate little paws grabbed onto Su Luo\u2019s trouser leg and a pair of small, short legs followed Su Luo in continuously circling around. Furthermore, it seemed as if it was chewing something in its mouth.A flash of insight appeared in Su Luo\u2019s mind; she suddenly remembered the scene of the adorable little dragon eating the eggshells from before\u2026..She couldn\u2019t be that unlucky right?A kind of ominous premonition emerged from within Su Luo\u2019s heart. She picked up the adorable little dragon and with slender fingers pried open its tiny dragon mouth.Following a close examination, three lines of bursting veins formed on Su Luo\u2019s forehead. For a split second she even had the desire to strangle the adorable little dragon.What did she see? She actually found pieces of the jade box in the adorable little dragon\u2019s mouth that had yet to be swallowed.She absolutely could not have mistaken that bright green characteristic of the jade.This little thing! It\u2026it actually ate the small jade box!Su Luo had a strong urge to flip the little dragon on its stomach in her lap and spank its butt.After a while of being mad at herself, Su Luo unhappily fixed her gaze on the adorable little dragon, as if attempting to kill it with her meaningful glare.However, the adorable little dragon seemed to be completely unaware of her glare. Instead, its head weaved to and fro, its sleepy eyes were drowsy from dozing off, the corner of its mouth was even splitting out tiny blue bubbles\u2026Su Luo was so infuriated that with a swish, she took out her personal dagger. She threateningly gestured everywhere along the small body of the adorable little dragon with the dagger and very fiercely said. \u201cCelestial Spirit water and the Spatial grass were swallowed but it shouldn\u2019t have been digested yet, right?\u201dThe adorable little dragon opened its misty eyes. Its face had a sluggish look of having just woken up. She only saw its little mouth move closer and then afterwards \u2014\u2014A crisp chomp sound rang out.Su Luo was once again dumbfounded.She rigidly fixed her eyes on the dagger handle used for self-protection and once again had a feeling of being driven irascibly mad!Damn it! Nangong Liuyun had said this dagger was made from top grade iron and also bragged about how exceptionally sharp it was. Unexpectedly\u2026unexpectedly it had become lunch for this little guy who in one bite chewed it apart.The adorable little dragon was munching away as if eating something very delicious like a cookie, with crisp crunching noises that gave off a sweet and flavorful impression.Su Luo was about to hit her forehead again.She felt that if she was to continue to stay together with the adorable little dragon, either she will be driven mad by this silly little dragon, or she will cut this silly little dragon into pieces. These were the only two possible roads she could take.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Originally she thought it was a treasure from the heavens; but she never would have expected that she had actually carried back a tiny demon!Before she believed that she was the goddess of fortune reincarnated as a mortal, but, now she felt that she was a villain that had killed the goddess\u2019s father and led to her decline.How did it end up like this? Spatial Grass and Celestial Spirit water were gone, doesn\u2019t this mean that she will never be able to open her space?The adorable little dragon apparently could detect Su Luo\u2019s anxiety, and it tilted its tiny head.Su Luo worriedly paced around with the dragon\u2019s swaying little legs following closely behind. It wobbled and shook while it fumbled after her from here to there. If strangers were to see this scene, they might be unsure whether to to laugh or cry.In the end, Su Luo crouched down, picked up the silly little dragon, looked it in the eye, and fiercely asked, \u201cLittle guy, you tell me. Should I stew you, or roast you, or stir-fry you?The silly little dragon was completely unaware it was about to be food.It tilted its head, and a pair of large, limpid, amber eyes foolishly watched Su Luo with a deep sense of puzzlement.\u201cDon\u2019t know how to speak right? Then I\u2019ll just take it as you agreeing with whatever I choose?\u201d Su Luo smiled while fishley surveying it. Holding her broken dagger and gestured over its little paws.As her mind became clear she began to realize something. Since Nangong Liuyun had obtained a blade of Spatial Grass, it should be the case that there was a second one.As for the Celestial Spirit water, since the Su family had been able to obtain it before, then there was sure to be more in this world. As long as she spend some time searching, then she definitely will find it.As for this dragon\u2019s blood, if not for a coincidence by chance, it would have been even harder to come by.What\u2019s more, this was actually divine dragon\u2019s blood, and much better when compared to the whatever inferior blood that came from the Armored Back Dragon.However, looking at the silly little dragon in front of her, Su Luo had her worries.This little thing, that had just hatched, was so thin and feeble, with delicate arms and legs. How could she take action?She had no desire to kill it; she only wanted to take a little blood from it. But she was worried that with one strike of her dagger would the adorable little dragon die?Just when Su Luo was indecisively wavering, suddenly the adorable little dragon leaned closer to her bosom, with eyes closed it reflexively sniffed around in her embrace like a piglet seeking milk to drink.Su Luo immediately became speechless.With one grab she pulled out the little guy and unhappily scowled, \u201cI\u2019m definitely not your dragon mother, so don\u2019t even think about poking around.\u201dThe silly little dragon opened its misty eyes, and it stupidly looked at Su Luo. Suddenly\u2014\u2014She only saw it opening its little mouth, a sharp and clear dragon\u2019s cry was uttered like a soft whistle\u2014\u2014Su Luo was immediately caught off guard, and her eardrums were in extreme pain from the shock. Her qi and blood rolled over into the pit of her stomach. She almost spitted out another mouthful of blood again.However, without waiting for Su Luo\u2019s reaction, the silly little dragon immediately opened its mouth and bit Su Luo\u2019s wrist!\u201cAhhh!\u201d A burst of acute pain almost made Su Luo jumped up.Although it had just hatched, dragon seeds are still dragon species, gifted and super strong. Its baby teeth were sharp, hard and strong. Su Luo\u2019s blood madly rushed forth from the bite wound on her wrist.She discovered that if she continued to stay with the silly little dragon, she sooner or later, would be spitting out blood. If she wasn\u2019t busy being infuriated to the point of spitting blood, then she would be jolted by its roars to spit blood, or just bleeding from its bite.Su Luo scowled at the silly little dragon, but it employed both of its limpid, waterclogged eyes and returned her gaze with a woebegone, pity-me expression. Moreover, both of its paws were clenched into tiny fists under its chin in an irresistibly cute posture.Looking at the pitiful appearance of the silly little dragon, Su Luo\u2019 breath was trapped in her lungs and was unable to explode out.Just at this moment, suddenly\u2014\u2014A band of intense, golden radiance enveloped the silly little dragon. She merely saw a small round lump of blood flew out of the silly little dragon\u2019s mouth. This blood had Su Luo\u2019s blood within it and also contained the little foolish dragon\u2019s own blood.She only saw that ball of blood unexpectedly take the form of a strange pattern of symbols. This design emitted an intensely dense and black air of mystery.Su Luo was dumbfounded as she watched this scene, she simply was unable to react.\u201cThis\u2026This really is\u2026.\u201d Previously, she had flipped through all the books on this continent\u2019s history and general knowledge, therefore a faint speculation appeared in her mind.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Afterwords, an enormous amount of knowledge immediately rushed into her head like a tide.The adorable little dragon had actually formed a contract with her? Moreover, it was a contract between equals, not one of subjugation.\u201cAdorable little dragon, what are you called?\u201d Su Luo could sense a thread of spiritual connection with the adorable little dragon, as if she can conduct a telepathic exchange with it.\u201cMah, Mah\u2026\u201d The young dragon\u2019s words weren\u2019t clear.\u201cMahMah? What kind of name it that? Forget it, I\u2019ll just call you Meng Meng (1) from now on, okay?\u201d Su Luo\u2019s slender figures rubbed the round and chubby head of the adorable little dragon.\u201cHa, ha\u2026\u201d The adorable little dragon seemed to be overjoyed. It laughed until its eyes become narrow lines.Without using any power, she had managed to subdue a little divine dragon. This gave Su Luo a feeling of being blessed, akin to the sensation of pies magically falling from the sky.Anyways, it was obvious that the goddess of fortune once again favored her.Suddenly, the scene in front of her eyes blurred. Su Luo dodged, but she had already entered a completely unfamiliar place.Su Luo carried the adorable little dragon and inquisitively looked around.Don\u2019t tell me, could it be\u2026.that this was her space?But this space was really small and only about ten square meters in size. Moreover, it only had a small fountain-like spirit spring and there was nothing else?Also, what made Su Luo even more depressed was that the adorable little dragon\u2019s body can enter. But as for her, only her spirit can enter.Her spirit entered the space, but her body was still outside.This made her somewhat depressed. It proved that her space was different from the legendary rumored space in one\u2019s body.The space spoken of in legendary rumors stated that the owner can enter with their physical body. This way, when in danger, the person at any time can avoid harm by entering their space. This indeed was the best treasure to bypass being killed for property while on a journey away from home.The reason why Su Luo dared to kidnap the adorable little dragon was largely in part due to her certainty that when the moment comes, she would have her space. When the divine dragon that chased and wanted to kill her arrived, she could hide in her space and thus her safety would be guaranteed.However looking at the current situation, she would have to take her time making a decision (2).Su Luo quietly examined this difficult to come by space.At this moment, the adorable little dragon had already taken some steps with its little short legs. Its entire body was on its stomach by the side of the spirit spring, with its little head leaning in to enthusiastically drink the spring water.The mouth of the spring was merely the size of a wooden barrel and the spring water was so clear that you could see the bottom. It also issued a faint but sweet fragrance.Su Luo drank a mouthful from the spirit spring and immediately felt as if the filth in her entire body had washed away, leaving nothing behind. Her entire body was relaxed and invigorated, her bright expression was full of crisp vital energy.But, this was not right\u2026Su Luo suddenly realized that this spirit spring compared to the Celestial Spirit water she stole from the Su Manor was exactly the same!She previously had tasted a tiny bit of the Celestial Spirit water, so now with just one drink she could determine it.Su Lu immediately felt as if a stone was lodged in her throat making her speechless.Before, in order to get that Celestial Spirit water, she had suffered untold hardships to steal it. She had been chased after by that conveniently cheap old father which caused her to run around the entire Manor. However, she never expected that after opening her space, the Celestial Spirit water available did not amount to mere bottles but instead contained an entire fountain of spirit spring.Wasn\u2019t the goddess of fortune smile down upon her too much? There was no way she could return the favor.While Su Luo was in the midst of her narcissistic thoughts, suddenly she had a very bad premonition. She became awared of a scathing murderous aura that was closing in from afar.She exited her space and tilted her head up to look. That divine dragon who was pursuing closely without letting go had arrived!Now, it sprayed a mouthful of Dragon\u2019s Breath directly towards her!Su Luo was so scared that her complexion quickly changed.She turned and just ran, similar to a cunning rabbit running at lightning speed.1) Meng Meng \u2013 Chinese pinyin for the character adorable.

She felt as lithe as a swallow, and her speed compared to before was faster by a large margin.Previously she was shaken until she spat out blood. She had run until utter exhaustion, but under a mouthful of spirit spring, these symptoms had now all disappeared.Run, run, run.Su Luo ran to the other side, grabbed the creeper vine and jumped off to swung all the way to the other side of the cliff.The divine dragon was tightly pursuing behind her, unwilling to let go.It breathed out a Dragon\u2019s Breath towards her, half of the cliff suddenly collapsed, numerous rocks began to rain onto Su Luo.Su Luo fell like a flexible Flood dragon (1), jumping right and left as she continued to dodge.When the chase got extremely close for comfort, Su Luo suddenly had a flash of insight that made her firmly slapped herself in the head.Her space had been opened already, so the adorable little dragon\u2019s blood held no more use for her. She can just return the adorable little dragon. How could she have been so stupid? How could she not have thought of this earlier?Su Luo\u2019s thoughts were well developed, but reality was very different.When she had come out, the adorable little dragon had been thrown into her space, so currently, Su Luo could clearly see the adorable little dragon with its tiny butt raised and its whole body lying in front of the fountain. It had its face in the spirit spring glup, glup, drinking it down. Slowly, the places where the spirit spring was located began to disappear.Inside Su Luo her mind and heart were in great pain.She hastily summoned the adorable little dragon in her mind, \u201clittle Meng Meng, good boy, nice boy, quickly come out now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d the adorable little dragon continued to drink.\u201cYour home\u2019s master is about to be beaten up by your mom! Quickly come out!\u201d Su Luo dodged left and right, while she continued to call anxiously.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d the adorable little dragon clutched the earth at the side of the spirit spring with its two small paws, dipped its head and continued to drink.On Su Luo\u2019s head, three lines of veins burst out.This disobedient little guy, when she escaped this, he\u2019ll see how she\u2019ll spank his little ass.On this road, Su Luo was being chased by the divine dragon while constantly zig-zagging and scurrying around in all directions. Finally, even she did not know where she had ended up.Suddenly, Su Luo sensed that there were people in front, and they were even people she was familiar with.Su Luo\u2019s eyes flashed with a secretive and evil look; then, with no guilt at all, she guided the divine dragon in their direction.Leading the trouble to the east (2), this was a trick Su Luo was very skilled at.Soon, Su Luo had gotten so close that she could see a five-person groupThe group was not just any random group. It was none other than Liu Ruohua\u2019s group.When Liu Ruohua turned her head to see Su Luo whole body\u2019s battered and exhausted appearance, obviously she looked very happy.She looked up, down and all over Su Luo; at last with an unbridled laugh she grinned, \u201cSu Luo, so it was you? We were only separated for so long, yet how did you become this embarrassingly disheveled?\u201dSu Luo absent-mindedly looked over at her, she blandly responded with one sentence, \u201cand you\u2019re not unkempt?\u201dCurrently, Liu Ruohua\u2019s clothing was filthy and tattered from head to toe. Her face was covered in scars from being scratched by tree branches, bloody all over, she was a complete mess.Her face was probably injured by the tornado from before.Liu Weiming looked at Su Luo, his eyes flashed with a complex look. He laughed with enthusiasm, \u201cMiss Su? How come his highness Prince Jin is not with you?\u201dSu Luo let out a sigh, \u201cHis highness Prince Jin had some business and left for a while, he will be back soon. Do you have some business that need him?\u201dWhen she heard this, Liu Ruohua let out a huge, maniacal mocking laugh. She pointed at Su Luo and said, \u201cYou little credit claiming whore! You think we don\u2019t know? His highness Prince Jin had already left chasing after the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy. He abandoned you, yet you still don\u2019t understand?

Ha, ha, ha, I\u2019m laughing to death. I\u2019m really dieing of laughter!\u201d Liu Ruohua laughed until tears came out. In her heart, her crazy envy of Su Luo completely dispersed into haze due to Su Luo having been discarded.Only Liu Ruohua\u2019s taunting laugh could be heard. She then sneered, \u201chow about you tell me. Didn\u2019t his highness Prince Jin go looking for the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy?\u201dSu Luo smiled coldly.Liu Ruohua\u2019s guess wasn\u2019t wrong. Didn\u2019t Nangong Liuyun really leave to go look for the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy?He deserted her, left her in the small wooden house. Wasn\u2019t it precisely because he wanted to look for the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy?Seeing the complicated mood on Su Luo\u2019s face, Liu Ruohua was happy to the extreme. She covered her belly while laughing heartily. She was laughing so hard that she could barely breathe. \u201cSu Luo, ah, Su Luo. Here I was under the impression that you had a lot of skills. After all, his highness Prince Jin was so loving towards you. You probably didn\u2019t expect that you being favored would last for a mere two days. Ha, ha, ha\u2014\u2014\u201dSu Luo only watched her laugh quietly, a secretive light appearing in her eyes. However it wasn\u2019t possible to see any changes on her face as it remained inscrutable.Liu Ruohua had enough of laughing, turned towards Liu Weiming and said. \u201cThe Wild Serpent\u2019s inner core is still on her body. Shouldn\u2019t we take it back?\u201dLiu Weiming frowned slightly, a trace of hesitance flickering across his eyes. After awhile, he finally said, \u201cDidn\u2019t she already swallow it?\u201dLiu Ruohua\u2019s face showed contempt for his idiocy while her eyes glared at Liu Weiming. \u201cAre you stupid?! How can the inner core of the Wild Serpent be so easily digested? Maybe it\u2019s still in her digestive track undamaged and intact! Being uncertain, why not just cut open her belly and then we\u2019ll know for sure, right?\u201dLiu Weiming was somewhat hesitant. After all, previously his highness Prince Jin had displayed a very caring manner towards Su Luo.Liu Ruohua let out a sneering laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? His highness Prince Jin has already abandoned her. Otherwise, why would his highness Prince Jin chase after the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy? Could it be that you think this slut can even be compared to the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy? If you were asked to choose, would you choose the precious, gloriously flowery fairy or this good-for-nothing? Don\u2019t tell me you feel that his highness Prince Jin\u2019s vision can\u2019t be compared to yours?\u201dLiu Ruohua\u2019s words coaxed at every step, penetrating deeply through each layer of resistance.Liu Weiming\u2019s expression had a frightful hidden depth. It issued a nebulous, deadly threatening air.He was aware that Liu Ruohua wanted to avenge a personal grudge, so she was trying to bewitch him, but he was still unable to refuse.The inner core of the Wild Serpent was indeed very important to him.As long as he could get the inner core, he would have the opportunity to become the personal disciple of Grandmaster Lan Hai. In that case, his cultivation road in the future would have propitious wind throughout the journey (1) as compared to harsh challenges one after another.A trace of a smile slowly emerged on Liu Weiming\u2019s face. It was an icy-cold and extremely dangerous smile.The dagger he hid in his sleeves suddenly moved.A trace of a sneer flashed through Su Luo\u2019s heart.A bunch of idiots!\u201cWhat are you guys thinking of doing?!\u201d Su Luo deliberately shouted out loudly and anxiously. \u201cIf his highness Prince Jin found out that you guys killed me, then he will never let you guys go!\u201d\u201cBragging like you have a tiger\u2019s pelt and actually hoisting it as a banner!\u201d Liu Ruohua measured her with a cold and threatening laugh. \u201cHis highness Prince Jin? First, let\u2019s not even talk about whether or not his highness Prince Jin would seek revenge on your behalf. Granted, even if he wanted to avenge you, he won\u2019t find you.

Before he could react, her figure was already ten meters away (1).Liu Weiming\u2019s dagger promptly met with empty air.A thread of surprise flashed through his eyes.He could feel that Su Luo\u2019s body did not contain a shred of spiritual power. This was sufficient to illustrate that she was simply an ordinary person that could not be more common and a waste of space.On the other hand, he, himself was already a third ranked mage.However, his sneak attack actually did not succeed? This gave him a strong feeling of having been thwarted.The corner of Su Luo\u2019s mouth evoked a smile that was nearly impossible to catch sight of.She smiled coldly. With her feet not even touching the ground, Su Luo turned her body and just ran. She could feel that the battle between the divine dragon and the fire phoenix was over. Now, the divine dragon is free to chase after her again in order to kill her.\u201cIf you have the ability then don\u2019t run!\u201d Liu Ruohua shouted then immediately gave chase!.\u201cIf you have the ability then don\u2019t chase!\u201d Su Luo turned her head around and made a face at Liu Ruohua.Telling her not to run, do they think that she was an idiot?A strong killing intent flashed through Liu Weiming\u2019s eyes.If a moment ago he had not made a move, then the matter would be over. Since he had already attempted an attack, he must now complete the task and eliminate all evidence.Otherwise, if Su Luo was to make sinister accusations in front of his highness Prince Jin later on, their lives would be forfeit.Even though his highness Prince Jin had tossed her aside and left, God knows when the temperamental Prince Jin would change his mind and go look for her again?At this moment, Liu Weiming eyes held a sinister blood-lust, overflowing with killing intent. The others watched as he ran so fast he seemed to be flying, tightly nipping at Su Luo\u2019s heels. He followed her closely, not giving her a chance to escape.Behind him, those four people without exception also chased after Su Luo to chip away at the task without abandoning it (2). Even if they were to die, they must behead her with their own blades.The distance between the two parties become shorter by the second as the chasing party drew closer with each step\u2026. closer and closer\u2026.\u201cHey, something is wrong\u2014\u2014\u201d Liu Weiming suddenly frowned. He sensed a dangerous atmosphere coming from behind them.He turned his head to look and his complexion immediately became pale white as paper. Both of his legs went limp, making it nearly impossible for him to stand.Seeing him like this, everyone turned their heads around to look\u2014\u2014\u201cHeavens, oh heavens\u2026.is that, is that a snake type beast?\u201d\u201cYou stupid airhead, thinking that it\u2019s a type of snake beast! That\u2019s a dragon! A divine dragon!\u201dOnce he said those words, everyone present stopped talking and were as silent as the dead.A divine dragon that legend said could destroy a city with a stomp of its feet, the Venerable divine dragon!It was simply too frightening.Even more terrifying was the fact that the divine dragon, behind them, was tenaciously chasing after them. Its eyes were full of a violent hatred and enmity as if they had stolen its child.But what caused the Venerable divine dragon to even feel that they were worth chasing, let alone chasing them with intent to kill?At this moment they simply did not have time to think, their brains just weren\u2019t functioning. They only knew to step forward and run, run, run\u2014\u2014Each ran as fast as they possibly could.If one of them could run past their companions, then that person would have a better chance of surviving.At this time, everyone was incomparably disheveled and unkempt.Running in front of them was Su Luo who was smiling with sinister treachery.Since Liu Weiming and the divine dragon both wanted to kill her, in that case, let them first massacre each other. After the winner has been decided, the survivor could then seek her to battle it out.Leading the trouble to the east (3), borrowing someone else\u2019s knife to kill another. These were tricks that Su Luo was most skilled at.In any case, Liu Weiming and companions had sinister and very savage intentions. Regarding this matter, she didn\u2019t feel even a tiny bit of guilt.Poor Liu Weiming and his companions who still didn\u2019t know that this divine dragon had been lured here.If they only knew that as long as they ran separate from Su Luo, they would escape being chased by the menacing divine dragon.However, people in times of danger will inevitably only have one thought: must firmly hold on to the target ahead and never let go.As a result, this doomed them to a tragic play.In contrast, Su Luo was very perceptive of human nature. She was certain that Liu Weiming and companions will make a move against her. Su Luo was also confident that they weren\u2019t aware that she had lured the divine dragon here. She was even more certain that when Liu Weiming and companions tried to escape the divine dragon, they would follow right behind her and become her protective shield.1) The author used three zhang: 1 zhang = 10 Chinese foot (chi) or 3.3 meters2) chip away at the task without abandoning it \u2013 to chisel away at sth; to persevere; unflagging efforts3) Leading the trouble to the east \u2013 idiom: meaning redirecting the trouble onto someone else\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now another had been killed by the divine dragon, so now there were only four people left in the team.The captain Liu Weiming, Liu Ruohua, Li Wan, and another youngster.The divine dragon kept getting closer, as if it was almost within a hand\u2019s reach\u2014\u2014\u201cAhhhh\u2014\u2014\u201d Another tragic cry sounded out.It was that of yet another youngster being consumed by the divine dragon\u2019s wrath in one mouthful, leaving not even a scrap behind.Su Luo was flying and running at lightning speed, but even she was unable to keep her heart from trembling.As she turned to see each and everyone of the human meatshields behind her about to be swallowed, she could only dread when it would be her turn.\u201cLet\u2019s split up and run! Otherwise, we\u2019ll all die!\u201d Liu Weiming was worthy of being named captain, for once he calmed down, he very quickly found the only solution.There was only one divine dragon, so as long as everyone scattered in all four directions, then at least three of the people could have a chance of escape.Liu Weiming sent Su Luo a quick glare full of hatred. He knew, Su Luo must die within Sunset Mountain Range. If she was to walked out alive, Heaven knows how his highness Prince Jin will deal with them once he learned the news that they had wanted to kill her.Even if they died, they wouldn\u2019t want his highness Prince Jin as an enemy.Therefore the best way was to get someone else to do his dirty work. He was going to borrow the might of the divine dragon to eradicate Su Luo!Having thought about this point, Liu Weiming, Liu Ruohua, and Li Wan exchanged glances. He made a hand gesture, consequently all three darted toward three different directions.She had no choice but to say Liu Weiming\u2019s method was truly correct. He had succeeded by a lucky stroke, and saved his own life and maybe even the lives of Liu Ruohua and Li Wan.Watching as those three people scattered, Su Luo\u2019s heart had a sense of loss. Alas, the human shaped meatshields were gone.Now her only hope was placed on the body of the adorable little dragon.The divine dragon gave chase and was getting closer and closer. Finally it cornered Su Luo at the base of an overhanging cliff.Three sides were sheer cliffs and a precipitous walls of rock. There were absolutely no routes of escape.Su Luo raised both of her hands, turned around. Her face had a very flattering smile, \u201c Heya, Venerable divine dragon, are you tired? Would you like to rest a bit?\u201dThe divine dragon\u2019s malevolently fierce face flashed, an unsympathetic and ice-cold pair of eyes had brought the atmosphere to a subzero temperature.

Its little face looked up, showing a pair of large winsome eyes with crocodile tears flowing down its face. It gave Su Luo a pitiful and wretched expression as if she had caused it to feel aggrieved.Within the space, Su Luo\u2019s spirit form glared at the little dragon with a fierce expression. \u201cIf you don\u2019t come out now, your mother dragon will kill me with one spray of Dragon\u2019s Breath! At that time you will also die! Let\u2019s play this game together!\u201dShe could not understand. Clearly on the other side was its birth mother, but the little dragon incorrectly kept looking at her and would not leave the space.Could it be that its own family was not as appealing as someone else\u2019s family? No wonder some kids, for whom exotic delicacies were the norm in their own family homes, preferred to eat ordinary vegetables dishes from other families.The adorable little dragon continued to use those pitiful eyes to look at Su Luo.Su Luo faked a fierce appearance and single-handedly picked up the adorable little dragon preparing to return it.But, both of the adorable little dragon\u2019s paws had a death grip on the edge of the spirit spring and refused to let go. Crocodile tears were falling from its eyes, as if to say that Su Luo was a human trafficker who kidnapped and sold children!Su Luo propped up her head with one hand. Whose family did this spoiled child really belong to? Please come and quickly carry it home because she couldn\u2019t afford to raise it.She merely want to return the little dragon to its original owner, so what was so wrong with that? The little dragon was making it seem as if she was sending it to the execution block.Finally, Su Luo was left without any other option. If the little dragon didn\u2019t show its face now, the divine dragon will definitely kill her with a mouthful of Dragon\u2019s Breath.As a result, Su Luo cajoled the little dragon using a gentle tone and displayed a friendly appearance. She clenched her teeth, put on a warm, tender smile and said. \u201cHow about I fill a large bucket with the spirit spring and you can take it home with you?\u201dThe adorable little dragon shook its head. \u201c \u2026.\u201d That wouldn\u2019t be nearly enough\u2026Su Luo was frustrated, but she, once again, put on a coaxing smile and said. \u201cThen how about\u2026.let\u2019s first go greet your mother dragon and politely ask about her health, okay? After all, she has not seen you since you hatched.\u201dThe adorable little dragon shook its head. \u201c \u2026.\u201d It was certain it would be be carried away!Su Luo only felt the space between her eyebrows burst with aggravation. Finally, she gave a secretive calculating smile and quickly picked up the adorable little dragon. \u201cYou think I won\u2019t be able to pick you up? Harumph, humph!\u201dIt came to Su Luo that within her space, she was the boss!When the adorable little dragon was lifted out of her space and appeared in her arms, the divine dragon had been in the midst of brewing a second Dragon\u2019s Breath.\u201cYour eminence, hurry and take it back.\u201d Su Luo cupped the adorable little dragon with both hands and hastily rushed forward to gave it back.She placed the adorable little dragon on the ground and motioned the little guy to hurry up and pay its respect.It should be said that the divine dragon had also suffered bitterly. After many trials and tribulations she birthed the egg then had to incubate it for a long time. Once the adorable little dragon was born, in spite of everything it refused to go home. It forced this new mother to chase after it and had succeeded in embarrassing her to death.The adorable little dragon, with wobbled and swaying steps, turned its head back every step and shuffled to the front of the divine dragon.The angry mother dragon used a water bucket-sized forefinger and poked its head causing the adorable little dragon to bend over like a roly poly and, with a loud thumping sound, fall backwards.That sight was comically funny and laughable, such that Su Luo almost laughed out loud.However, the divine dragon just indifferently swept her eyes toward Su Luo.That expression was cold as ice, and a frosty air started to climb up from the soles of her feet. All at once, Su Luo could not laugh anymore.The eyes of the divine dragon contained an endless killing intent, and its ferocious expression gave off a violently irate mood. It was about to let loose a wave of Dragon\u2019s Breath towards Su Luo.However just at this time, the adorable little dragon clutched at the divine dragon\u2019s finger and followed the path up its arm, wobbling and swaying as it climbed up. Finally its tiny buttocks sat on top of the divine dragon\u2019s nose, cleanly dispersing the Dragon\u2019s Breath its mother was brewing.In that moment, the divine dragon and the adorable little dragon had an appearance of mutual affection for one another, of a mother and child.Su Luo\u2019s heart moved. If she didn\u2019t leave now then what was she waiting for?If the divine dragon discovered that the adorable little dragon and her had formed a contract, she\u2019s afraid it would squash her to death with one slap of its claws.Hence, Su Luo walked quietly on the tips of her toe and retreated a few steps.

As a result she was very careful while making her way along the roads.She had already accomplished her goal for entering this mountain range. Although the process was very thrilling, her luck had been exceptionally good. There had been plenty of unforeseen perils and no shortage of danger. Not only had her space opened, she had also formed a contract of equals with the little divine dragon by a sheer accident among many implausible causes.However it was a pity, that the little divine dragon had been carried home by its mother dragon.Su Luo sighed, slowly searched for a path to leave the mountains. However what she did not know was, that on the other side, Nangong Liuyun was about to go mad in his search for her.Nangong Liuyun\u2019s face was pale and unwaveringly fixed on the trunk of the thousand year old ancient tree. His tightly clenched fist was blanched white!The ancient tree stood as before, but the wooden house that had been on the top had disappeared without a trace. For Nangong, it was as if someone had walked away, taking with them even the pots and pans, without even leaving a speck behind.As Nangong Liuyun stared rigidly at that thousand year old ancient tree, his eyes were ruthless, tyrannical and cold enough to freeze everything within his gaze. On his handsome face that was normally nefarious and devilishly charming, something had changed. Now his face was a wave of astral frost. His stare was violent like that of a wild beast\u2019s and filled with a cruel bloodlust.Nangong Liuyun could only feel a sharp pain bursting from the area near his heart. The ache was so painful that he almost suffocated.By his side, stood an exquisitely beautiful woman that was elegant and quiet, seemingly above the common populace.She was dressed from head to toe in only a snowy white gown. A graceful neck, a slender waist, and, just below, a skirt that seemed to flow with the breeze, as if wishing to transform into a beautiful wisp then disappear like snow melting into spring.This person was not a stranger. She was none other than the rumored Jade Lake\u2019s fairy.In a deeply concerned manner, the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy placed her hand on Nanong Liuyun who was kneeling on the ground. Her red full lips gently and humbly stated. \u201cThird senior brother (1), it\u2019s all Yao Yao\u2019s fault. Imposing on you until you sustained injuries, and also tiring you out until Miss Su disappear without a trace\u2026.\u201dNangong Liuyun\u2019s complexion was like a sheet of ice. He hadn\u2019t spoken a word, but his eyes were full of self-loathing and guilt.All of a sudden, he severely slapped himself hard, quickly followed by another slap!The strength his hands used could frighten people, and with only these two slaps, he was able to make himself vomit blood.\u201cThird senior brother!\u201d A thread of anguish flashed across Jade Lake\u2019s fairy\u2019s eyes.

If I didn\u2019t leave her, she wouldn\u2019t be\u2026.\u201d A thread of tormented pain flashed across Nangong Liuyun\u2019s handsome face which had lost all of its original devilish charm. His strained voice hinted that he was being choked by his own emotions.What happened here? How could Luo girl have disappeared? It was all his fault. He shouldn\u2019t have abandoned her in that moment of peril. If he didn\u2019t abandoned her, how could this have had a chance to occur!?!?In the midst of blaming himself, Nangong Liuyun ruthlessly smashed his clenched fist towards the trunk of that thousand year old ancient tree.The ancient tree, which had a width equivalent to ten people that were wrapped arm in arm, fell to the ground with a bang. A large cloud of dust rose concluding its thousand year lifespan.A trace of complex emotion crossed through the eyes of the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy. Her cloudy eyes were like a sublime mist, partitioning the darkness in the innermost part of her heart. She held a deeply concerned expression on her face as she said to him, \u201cthird senior brother. Don\u2019t worry too much. Who knows what happened to Miss Su? Maybe even now she is having a fortuitous meeting?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. She doesn\u2019t any spirit strength in her body.\u201d A touch of despair passed through Nangong Liuyun\u2019s eyes.His Luo girl absolutely do not know how to harness spirit power. Alone and being left behind, how could she survive in this Sunset Mountain Range when the entirety of its length and breath was filled with wild beasts? Maybe even now\u2026Every time he thought about it, Nangong Liuyun would feel waves of tormenting pain gripping his heart.\u201cThis won\u2019t do! I must go look for her now!\u201d Nangong Liuyun struggled to stand up because of insufficient strength he almost fell.The Jade Lake\u2019s fairy saw Nangong Liuyun\u2019s body faintly tremble, as if he could not even stand; but he still insisted on going to search for Su Luo. She was almost unable to conceal the complicated expression in her eyes1) Third senior brother \u2013 Chinese literal translation is third brother from the same teacher.

Her beautiful eyes moving cleverly around, her voice sounded justifiable and honest as she said. \u201cThird senior brother, looking at how badly injured you are, how can you go search for her? Even if you could find her, if she really was in danger, would you be able to save her?\u201dThe Jade Lake Fairy\u2019s words were reasonable and irrefutable. She had hit the nail on the head.Nangong Liuyun truly had suffered severe injuries.In order to save the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy, his abdomen had been slashed heavily by the king vulture\u2019s claws and had bled profusely. Once he was able to finally stop the bleeding, Nangong Liuyun had rushed here to look for Su Luo, only to find that she had disappeared.\u201cThird senior brother, right now your first priority is to recover from your wounds.\u201d The Jade Lake\u2019s fairy gazed at him in concern, \u201cBelieve in me, okay? I\u2019ll send people to look for her right now. I trust they\u2019ll find this Miss Su and bring her back quickly.\u201dNangong Liuyun struggled to get up, his wounds that he had worked so hard to close had re-opened. Suddenly, fresh blood spurted from the wounds like spring water wildly rushing forward.Due to excessive blood loss, Nangong Liuyun\u2019s lips had turned white as paper while his face displayed a haggard appearance.Nangong Liuyun firmly grabbed the hand of the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy. Although weak, he maintained his dignified manner and very seriously stated. \u201cWe must find her!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d The Jade Lake Fairy squeezed out a smile and solemnly nodded her head.Even Nangong Liuyun failed to notice the flash of frost that passed through her eyes.After he finished speaking, Nangong Liuyun sat down cross-legged and began exercising his powers to heal himself. He needed to nurse his body back to full health, his Luo girl was still waiting for him somewhere.The Jade Lake\u2019s fairy had successfully appeased Nangong Liuyun. Seeing him begin the healing process, her beautiful watery eyes showed a look of deep anticipation while her red lips displayed a slight superficial smile.Then, she turned to leave.Beside a cliff covered with a bottomless drop covered in dense fog.The magnificent Jade Fairy stood on the edge of the cliff. Her long hair which flowed down to her ankles was dancing in the wind, giving the illusion that she was on the verge of taking flight, like a fairy. However, at this time, she had an indifferent and icy expression on her face.Behind her stood a row of four young women led by a woman named Qin Ning. Qin Ning was the magnificent Jade Fairy\u2019s most trusted attendant.The magnificent Jade Fairy\u2019s beautiful, simple, and neat face had a shallow smile, \u201cDid all of you hear third senior brother\u2019s words? Now, the only task for you is to look for this Miss Su.\u201dQin Ning\u2019s reply was very direct. Glancing at the magnificent Jade Fairy\u2019s beautiful, cold, and expressionless face, she murmured. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cRemember, if still alive, I must see the person. If dead, I must see the corpse.\u201d The magnificent Jade Fairy unhurriedly spit out those words while stressing the last four. She continued to smile gently and gorgeously as before, so otherworldly beautiful that just a glance could drive all living things mad.Qin Ning had grown up together with the magnificent Jade Fairy, so once she heard the words she immediately understood their hidden meaning.A barely perceivable treacherous chill flashed in Qin Ning\u2019s eyes as she responded. \u201cThis servant will not fail to comply with the Young Mistress\u2019s command, if living then must see the person, if dead then must see the corpse!\u201dThe master and servant simultaneously laughed together, with mutual understanding.Qin Ning led the other three people and quickly walked away while sneering in her heart endlessly.A toad that wants to eat swan flesh! An insignificant idiotic girl dares to try to snatch a guy away from the Young Mistress. Is she looking to court her own death?That little slut! If she is dead, then it was over. If she wasn\u2019t dead, hehe, when the time comes, they will torment that slut until she wished she was dead. They will make her regret that she was ever born into this world.Qin Ning and the three women flew through the mountain range, following the crushed plants while flying as fast as lightning.When the divine dragon had previously chased after Su Luo, it had left behind a trail of destruction, making the route fairly obvious.Qin Ning moved along this road, continuously searching.Qin Ning and companions were rather lucky as they soon ran into Liu Ruohua.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After a little bit of questioning, she discovered that Su Luo had indeed been lucky enough to survive. She had even escaped from that tornado!Qin Ning gave her a sly and cold smile. It looks like their moment to earn some merit from the young princess was finally here.As a result of the directions provided by Liu Rouhua, Qin Ning was able to retrace the path that Su Luo had used when fleeing for her life. She was determined to hunt this Su Luo down. .Su Luo still didn\u2019t know that Qin Ning had brought people to chase after her with the intent to kill. Right now she was in the middle of cooking a few stolen magical beast\u2019s eggs over an open fire.During this entire afternoon, she had been constantly running away from those who wanted to kill her. Because of this, she had consumed a huge amount of her stamina; therefore she had to fill her stomach first. Besides, in this Sunset Mountain Range, who knew when her next meal would be at.Her journey\u2019s bitter experiences, after entering Sunset Mountain Range, made Su Luo realize that, in this world, strength was the most important thing to have. So she urgently needed to find a peaceful place to start her cultivation practices.Seeing her dual wood and fire elements encircling her body, Su Luo bit off a mouthful of magical beast\u2019s egg. Her heart was elated, she planned to find some basic wood, fire element books to practice with after leaving this place.Suddenly, Su Luo\u2019s hand that was holding the magical beast egg paused, a feeling of impending crisis assailed her thoughts.She had spent her entire previous life working as an assassin, so naturally Su Luo was most sensitive to this kind of murderous intent.She was absolutely sure she was not wrong about this!This was not the killing intent emitted by a magical beast but from a person!Su Luo saw the other few eggs still being cooked, without even having to think she picked them up and threw them into her space. She immediately headed into the forest and slipped away very quickly.Su Luo ran in a hurry for a full four hours (1). When she finally stopped, she quickly hid behind a sheer cliff.Now the sky had gradually darken towards night, the moon was casting its hazy shadow.Su Luo slowed down and quieted her breathing, she also slowed down her heartbeat. Her entire person was hidden in darkness blending in with the cliff within the dark night.Even master martial artist wouldn\u2019t be able to distinguish her from the face of the cliff.At that very moment, a maiden seemed to fly over from afar. Her clothes was white like snow, with a simple and neat appearance, a light blue-colored diaphanous outer layer covering her clothing. Her body gave off an exceedingly refined manner.Su Luo recognized her. She was not a stranger but one of the maids standing by the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy\u2019s side.Su Luo had an excellent memory. As long as she saw them before, even after a few years, she would be able to recognize them at once. This was especially true for someone she meet only half a day ago.\u201cSu Luo, I know you are over there, come out, no need to hide.\u201d This person was called Cui Yu, her call was cold and devoid of any mercy. In the darkness of the night, it conjured up quite a horrifying feeling.Su Luo sneered in her mind: if she really knew where Su Luo was then why was she still looking around in all directions?How could this be considered knowing where she was?Was she underestimating her as a good-for-nothing greenhorn who knows nothing?However, Su Luo thought this was odd. Why had this maid come looking for her? And also why was she carrying a strong killing intent on her body?Was it because\u2026.Su Luo thought of a possibility.That kind of person, clear as ice and clean as jade (2), a woman seemingly not profaned by the worldly dust. Would she actually order her underlings to kill her? Although it was unreasonable, it was also not impossible.Ke Nan (3) said it best, if you rule out everything that was impossible, then the remaining reason must be the truth, no matter how crazy it sounded.It seem that the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy\u2026.was also human!She originally thought that she was so temperate, so lofty and unsoiled, so exceedingly refined, and so above the common people. But as it turned out she was also a woman that would go frantically crazy over a man.Su Luo\u2019s heart smiled coldly.She must capture this girl and confirm her own guess, so she can determine who her her real enemy was.She, Su Luo was never a person to sit and wait for death, if others want to kill her then they must pay with their lives!Su Luo motionlessly hid somewhere below the cliff.Waiting for Cui Yu to get closer.1) Chinese divided our modern 24 hours cycle into 12 shichen.

Su Luo\u2019s body shifted as quick as lightning and within seconds had already arrived at Cui Yu\u2019s back. Su Luo\u2019s half broken dagger was wielded with deadly aim towards Cui Yu\u2019s throat.Su Luo\u2019s movements were precise and nimble, merciless and blood-thirsty, there wasn\u2019t a single wasted motion.Cui Yu proved to be a second ranked martial artist. She sensed danger approaching and slid to the left while attempting to stab the person behind with her sword.However, she was already a step too late.While Cui Yu was leaning left to avoid the dagger aimed at her throat, Su Luo had already anticipated Cui Yu\u2019s actions and had moved the dagger there in advance. Therefore, when Cui Yu leaned to the left, she ran directly into the dagger.A \u201cSshhluck!\u2014\u2014\u201d sound lightly echoed and a stream of blood rushed out like spring water\u201cAhhhh\u2014\u2014\u201d Cui Yu did not die immediately, but the pain caused her to roll around on the ground.The instant kill failed because Su Luo\u2019s dagger had lost half of its effectiveness. Half of the dagger had been chewed off by the adorable little dragon previously, therefore it was not sharp enough to kill Cui Yu instantly.Su Luo coldly watched Cui Yu rolling around on the ground in pain and quietly asked, \u201cWhy are you trying to kill me?\u201cYou must die!\u201d Cui Yu\u2019s facial features were malevolent, her expression twisted, but her chin was still unbending and arrogantly raised.\u201cJust tell me the truth and I\u2019ll release you from your suffering. How do you feel about this deal?\u201d Su Luo said with a bargaining tone as she squatted down and gave Cui Yu a smile that didn\u2019t reach her eyes.Cui Yu coldly turned her face away, not paying any attention to Su Luo\u2019s threats.In Cui Yu\u2019s eyes, Su Luo was just an ant. She would never admit that Su Luo was stronger than her.\u201cVery courageous of you!\u201d Su Luo pulled out the blood encrusted, half-broken dagger. Her smile was genial, like a warm breeze. It did not contain even a hint of anger. \u201cAs you already know, my dagger is very dull. It can\u2019t kill a person in one strike.\u201d\u201cHumph.\u201d Cui Yun firmly spat out.\u201cVery good! I admire your courageous spirit. I hope you can keep it up as we continue.\u201d Su Luo\u2019s face held a faint yet sly smile. She smiled with ease while the dagger mercilessly zoomed towards Cui Yu\u2019s finger.A finger was forcibly cut off.\u201cAhhh\u2014\u2014\u201d Cui Yu was in so much pain that her tears and mucus flowed out together. The agony almost made her pass out.Without waiting for Cui Yu to speak, the second finger was quickly severed and went flying off.The third finger\u2026.\u201cI\u2019ll talk! I\u2019ll talk!\u201d A trace of startled surprise flashed through Cui Yu\u2019s eyes.She did not understand. Even though Cui Yu is a practitioner of martial arts, she would not be able to use such a cruel method. How was Su Luo able to do it so skillfully and with such a gentle and soft smile, at that?It was as if what she was slicing off were not fingers but pieces of bread.This person was simply a monster!\u201cYou need not be so anxious. I haven\u2019t completely chopped them all off yet.\u201d Su Luo gestured with her hand as if to say she still wished to continue cutting off more.Cui Yu reluctantly but loudly said, \u201cIt was the Young Mistress that told us to kill you! For every grievance, someone is responsible. For every debt, there is a debtor. If you have the ability, then go look for the Young Mistress to seek your revenge!\u201d\u201cWhy would she want to kill me?\u201d As expected, it was the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy who wanted to kill her.Cui Yu stared at Su Luo as if looking at an idiot. \u201cDo you really not understand? Our Young Mistress from when she was little until now is deeply attached to his highness Prince Jin! They grew up together and since childhood, their mutual affection was unlike others! In everyone\u2019s eyes, the Young Mistress and Prince Jin was like a pair of Jade Annulus. As for you, his highness Prince Jin actually kissed you. Therefore, you can not be forgiven.\u201d\u201cJust because he kissed me, thus your Jade Lake\u2019s fairy wants to kill me?\u201d Su Luo coldly smiled. Her guess was indeed correct.\u201cYes! Because his highness Prince Jin does not allow others to get close to him. The only person who can even touch him is our Young Mistress! Now, there is a third wheel and that is you. Therefore, you must die!\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

More like \u2018exceedingly refined\u2019 cow dung; what \u2018being above the common populace\u2019s dirty emotions\u2019, they were all a bunch of dog shit!Nangong Liuyun was so stupid, that it made her want to laugh. He always bragged about being highly intelligent, but was unable to see clearly that the woman by his side had the heart of a snake and the methods of a scorpion.\u201cWhat about Nangong Liuyun? How is he right now?\u201d A hidden meaning passed through Su Luo\u2019s huge eyes, which sparkled and were translucent like jade. The corner of her mouth had a faintly mocking expression.\u201cHis highness Prince Jin and our Young Mistress are together!\u201d These words were correct but Cui Yu had not told the whole truth.Su Luo nodded her head.Nangong Liuyun, when you saw that the little treehouse had been wiped out, was your heart able to feel guilt and remorse?Being you were unsure of whether I am dead or alive, were you worried?Why was it that the one that was looking for me is not you?So once you have your Jade Lake\u2019s fairy, do I no longer matter to you?If I think about it this way, then the vow you previously made to me -and all that you said- are really laughable.As expected. If ever she depended on a mountain for support, then the mountain would collapse. If she leaned on a person, the person would run away. People ah\u2026she could only rely on herself.Su Luo\u2019s pair of eyes were like water, but she had an icy-cold expression that was intent on hearing the truth, \u201cTalk, how many people did your Jade Lake\u2019s fairy send out to kill me?\u201dSince they were already dispatched, the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy wanted to completely eliminate her. It seemed like this time, she really was surrounded by perils. It was extremely dangerous.Su Luo didn\u2019t know what was wrong with her. Could it be because her character was lacking?It had only been half a day, yet she had already encountered three cases of being chased by groups trying to kill her.She felt as if she should personally visit a temple and burn a stick of incense, pay respect to Buddha, or do anything to try and get rid of this rotten fortune. She simply had the worst luck.However, Cui Yu face\u2019s became unresponsive, and she turned her head away.\u201cDon\u2019t want to talk? Very good, extremely good.\u201d A sinister sneer appeared in Su Luo\u2019s eyes.Right now Su Luo\u2019s mood was really gloomy, and here was a person not afraid of death, delivering herself for Su Luo to vent on. This was really the only good thing going for her at the moment .Without as much as a hint of hesitation, her dagger directly chopped down!\u201cAhhhh\u2014\u2014My hand\u2014\u2014\u201d Cui Yu could only see that her entire wrist had been cut off with blood pouring out and spraying madly everywhere.\u201cYou\u2014\u2014\u201dShe hadn\u2019t even finished when Su Luo\u2019s dagger chopped down again!\u201cAhhhhh\u2014\u2014\u201dCui Yu\u2019s other hand was also severed, blood similarly madly rushed forth.\u201cI\u2019ll talk\u2026..I\u2019ll talk!\u201d Cui Yu was in so much pain that she almost died. Her complexion was as pale as paper, and cold sweat was falling down like rain.\u201cActually, you can still wait for a moment.\u201d Su Luo\u2019s smile was as friendly as a warm breeze, but in Cui Yu\u2019s eyes, she was like a demon from Asura\u2019s Hell, with an expression full of a terrible sinister intent.\u201cApart from me, there are three other people.\u201d Cui Yi was in so much agony that she could only grasp roughly for air. Her eyes unwaveringly glared at Su Luo, full of fierce, malicious curses. \u201cEveryone of their strength is stronger than mine, and they definitely will avenge me!!!\u201d\u201cReally? Then let\u2019s just wait and see.\u201d Su Luo stood up, towering above her and disdainfully looked down at her. \u201cUpon the fact that you revealed everything.

She immediately died and couldn\u2019t have been more dead.\u201cIt was you who committed suicide, I certainly did not make a move to kill you.\u201d Su Luo smiled while showing off her snowy white teeth.After that, she quickly began to clean up any traces that may be left behind.Wasting no less than one hour, she had erased all traces. Then, she advanced deep into the mountains.She knew that the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy wanted to kill her, so she only had three possible roads she could take.One way was to avoid the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy and find Nangong Liuyun.The Jade Lake\u2019s fairy wouldn\u2019t dare to kill her in front of Nangong Liuyun, but this method had a high degree of difficulty. In addition, she really didn\u2019t want to see him right now.The second way was to hide deep within this mountainous ancient forest, making sure that the other side could never find her.As for the third way, it was to kill everyone that the Jade Lake\u2019s fairy had sent after her.However that last option, with regards to the current Su Luo, was too unrealistic.The towering, majestic mountains extended endlessly into the distance.Su Luo continuously dove into the forests of the deep mountain. Along the way, she carefully erased any trace of her passing, hoping she would not be found by the other side.She walked for about two hours, when a sense of danger assaulted her mind. Su Luo now had a tingling feeling along her back.She knew, she was being followed by someone.Also the person this time, like Cui Yu had said, had martial arts that were at a much higher level than Cui Yu\u2019s.Su Luo hid deep within the ancient trees, and coldly looked towards the front.There was a woman wearing a light yellow-colored slip over her garments. Her breath was stronger than Cui Yu\u2019s, so she was probably a third ranked martial artist.Su Luo was able to kill Cui Yu because of her sneak attack, but this person was already at the third rank. This time, it would be difficult to handle!Su Luo blended herself into the night, as much as possible, reducing her presence.However.All of a sudden, she could only see this maiden called Er Huang smile coldly. Subsequently, she directly came at Su Luo with an attack.She had actually been discovered!The strength in that sword strike was not something Su Luo could block right now.Su Luo dropped to the ground and rolled away, evading that fatal attack.Right after, she lengthened her steps and dashed ahead.Su Luo knew that if she was to fight one on one, this person could easily and effortlessly knock her out.The current her could only evade and hide.Su Luo saw the creeper vine in the forest, and her heart rejoiced. She lifted up the creeper vine and entered a secret hidden cave.The cave was very narrow, with only a square meter of space. Su Luo\u2019s back pressed up against the cave\u2019s wall. She controlled her breathing and suppressed her heartbeat to its lowest speed, like a cold-blooded animal during hibernation. It could be sensed that she only had a trace of presence.Through the creeper vine, Su Luo\u2019s eyes narrowed into a slit. At the same time, her heart was full of wrath.Jade Lake\u2019s fairy, if you want a man, don\u2019t you know how to win him over by yourself? What kind of ability is it to kill an outsider like her!?!?Su Luo clenched her fist firmly, a furious intent flashing through her eyes. She vowed to wait until her strength rose. She would absolutely balance this account and properly return the compliment!However, right now, Su Luo could only rage inside and endure it silently.However, her attempt to forbear was too late.Because her emotions had been too stirred up, therefore, her vitality rose too vigorously. Consequently, that Er Huang maiden was finally able to detect a thread of difference.Seeing that the sword was about to strike towards her with a killing intent, Su Luo rolled on the ground, rushing out and leaving the small cave.She managed to escape this time\u2019s extremely close and thrilling death chase.However, a good thing didn\u2019t last forever. Very quickly, halfway on the road, Su Luo again detected that she had been locked on by Er Huang!This indeed, was the soul of the deceased having not dispersed (1)!Su Luo hid herself in a swamp. Her entire body was buried in the muddy ooze. She was covered in dried up decomposing tree leaves, with only a pair of eyes exposed at the surface.She stopped her breathing, and wished that this time she could escape.However, this Er Huang maiden stood at the edge of the swamp. There was an unkind fury on her face, like that of someone who had long endured, but was still unable to catch that person.1) the soul of the deceased having not dispersed \u2013 idiom: figuratively meaning the influence still lingers on; the spirit (of some doctrine) is still alive.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Su Luo took advantage of her every careless mistake to escape, causing Er Huang to become extremely frustrated and unhappy!Just like now, right when Er Huang was about to lock onto Su Luo, Su Luo\u2019s entire person once again seemed to have disappeared without a trace.Er Huang vented her anger by launching sword attacks at the swamp, the tip of her double-edged sword sparkled with golden lightning as it flipped endless pieces of mud into the sky.Within the sword tip, spirit strength accumulated. The light that came from the sword strike was strong enough to take a life.\u201cWhoosh\u2014\u2014\u201d A band of golden rays flashed by Su Luo\u2019s right side, striking her right arm. Su Luo felt a sudden acute pain. It was so agonizing that cold sweat broke out on her face.At that instant, Su Luo was under the impression that her right arm had been severed.It took another two hours before Er Huang\u2019s deranged venting of her fury had finally ended.Su Luo clenched her teeth while crawling out of the swamp. Her right arm was drenched in blood, the intense pain almost made her pass out.The magnificent Jade Fairy, you did well! This hatred has been engraved into my heart!Su Luo dragged her exhausted body forward until she found a creek to wash clean her wound. At the same time, she also washed her clothes that were covered with mud.Due to excessive blood loss, Su Luo felt that her head was spinning, her vision was becoming blurry, and her body was about to faint. She inwardly cried about the hardships in her heart. Right now, she really could not run anymore. If things continued this way, sooner or later, she would be captured by Er Huang.Suddenly, a light bulb went off in her head, as Su Luo remembered that she had her own treasured space.Although there was nothing in the space, it still contained the spirit spring. This spirit spring was a sacred commodity that had the ability to heal.Su Luo cupped her hands, drew the water from her space, and drank. The spirit spring water was like ambrosial nectar; rich, mellow, and full-bodied. Its pure aroma enticed and beckoned.Su Luo\u2019s previous weak mental state became a lot stronger. Her thought processes recovered completely and she no longer felt dizzy.After drinking her fill, Su Luo again withdrew a handful of water and sprinkled it on her wounds.Although the wounds were not healed immediately, the bleeding slowly stopped.Su Luo released a sigh of relief. At long last, she had come back from death\u2019s door. She had survived.However, before Su Luo could complete her sigh of relief, she suddenly felt danger approaching from behind.Su Luo rolled on the ground and avoided a vicious sword strike.The attacker was not Er Huang but Nen Lu.She was among the four people that were chasing Su Luo with the intent to kill.\u201cVile girl, so you were hiding here, causing your mother to search for you for a long time! Eat my sword!\u201d Without saying another word, Nen Lu directly thrust her sword at Su Luo.The long double-edged sword became numerous rays of light. In a manner of hiding the sky and covering the earth (1), it launched towards Su Luo.Momentarily, an unnatural gale which was not caused by the weather erupted.Su Luo simply could not deflect the attack, she could only rely on her speed to dodge.However, her body had suffered a severe injury and had also lost a large amount of blood, so she wasn\u2019t as nimble as before.\u201cSlash\u2014\u2014\u201dSu Luo was too slow to dodge, so she was hit with a piercing blow by the double-edged sword. The sharp pain that exploded almost made her faint on the spot. The wound that she had with great difficulty stopped from bleeding, once again burst open.Overwhelming pain washed over her.Su Luo clenched her teeth. She bit her bottom lip so hard that blood began to seep out.Su Luo could not fall. If she fell down now, she would definitely die!In front of her was an overhanging cliff. The drop from the cliff was deep, so deep that you could not see the bottom. It was also surrounded by heavy fog.Su Luo\u2019s eyes flashed with relentless determination!Even if she were to die, she will pull the other person down with her!However, Su Luo did fall down\u2026.She weakly fell to the ground, motionless as if she had died. Her body lacked even the tiniest sign of life.A cold smile appeared in Nen Lu\u2019s eyes. She walked to Su Luo\u2019s body, crouched down, and sneered. \u201cLittle slut, you have the impertinence to seduce his highness Prince Jin. Even if you die a hundred times it won\u2019t be enough! Rest assured and go. His highness Prince Jin will be well looked after by our Young Mistress.\u201dAfter saying this, she hoisted up Su Luo\u2019s corpse and quickly threw it over the cliff\u2019s edge.Big sister Qin Ning had said before: destroy not only the corpse, but also the evidence.However, at this moment, misfortune unexpectedly occurred.1) hiding the sky and covering the earth \u2013 idiom: figuratively meaning earth-shattering; omnipresent; of universal importance\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her body was hanging upside down, with her head facing the ground. That broken dagger ruthlessly stabbed towards Nen Lu\u2019s heart from her back!\u201cAhhhh\u2014\u2014\u201d Nen Lu let out a wretched scream, the fury in her heart was at its peak. She endured the intense pain and used all her strength to throw Su Luo off the cliff.However, Su Luo was stuck to her body like Niupi candy (1). No matter what she did, she couldn\u2019t threw Su Luo off.At the same time, Su Luo unceasingly stabbed her with the dagger.In less than a second, countless numbers of lacerations appeared on Nen Lu\u2019s body.However, Nen Lu wouldn\u2019t let Su Luo have an easy time of it either. She finally sent a heavy palm strike towards Su Luo.The pit of Su Luo\u2019s stomach was hit by that palm. Su Luo only felt a metallic sweetness in her throat, and then a huge stream of blood wildly sprayed out.At this moment, both of them were at the edge of the cliff. The bitingly cold wind screamed through the mountains, blowing on the two bruised and battered people, who were on the verge of collapse.The sound of Nen Lu\u2019s grim laugh echoed, as she sent one foot kicking towards Su Luo.This kick contained all of her strength. She had already calculated that this kick was enough to send Su Luo down the cliff, as a way to destroy the body while erasing all the evidence.However, just at this critical juncture, Su Luo grabbed onto and tightly hugged Nen Lu\u2019s leg which was kicking her.Because of the effect of gravity, both of them fell off the cliff.While they were falling, Su Luo used her strength to keep pulling and twisting, until she was on top, while Nen Lu was beneath her.Nen Lu was so angry that she wanted to do the same by imitating Su Luo\u2019s actions, but Su Luo\u2019s foot heavily kicked her downwards.Nen Lu\u2019s heart was so enraged that she swore, if there was a next life, she would definitely dismember Su Luo\u2019s body and chop it into ten thousand pieces!But there wasn\u2019t enough time for her to think much more. Now, the two of them had already dropped close to the bottom of the abyss.\u201cSplash\u2014\u2014\u201dBoth of them fell into the water, the deafening sound of water being displaced resounded, like being shot out of a geyser, water flew high into the sky. At that moment, both of them completely lost consciousness.Both of their bodies were brutally pulled by the current of the creek, continuously colliding with obstructions in the water. Nobody knew where this water flowed to.Unaware of how much time had passed, Su Luo\u2019s eyelashes, which were thin as a cicada\u2019s wing, trembled slightly. She slowly opened her eyes, and saw a rock above her head.She now discovered that the illuminations in all directions were very dim, and that she had been washed ashore by the creek water.Su Luo found that her entire body was in pain. It was so agonizing, that it was as if her body had been torn into tiny little pieces. The pain was so great that she was almost numb.Su Luo fetched a handful of water from within her space, and with much difficulty, she drank it. After a long while, she was slowly able to recover.She staggeringly stood up, and suspiciously took measure of her surroundings.This place was a crescent-shaped cave.A cave that had been abandoned for many years.Su Luo was so weak that she could barely stand, but she clenched her teeth and stood up. She swayingly staggered towards the inside of the cave.She supported herself using the cave\u2019s wall. With great strain, she walked more than a hundred meters into the cave, yet she still hadn\u2019t reached the end.This strip of dark tunnel was pitch-black and gloomy, as if leading to a borderless underworld. Everything was covered in darkness.However, without knowing why, it seemed as if a mysterious power was beckoning to her. It continuously coaxed her to continue walking deeper inside.She roughly walked about another three hundred meters. Su Luo kept breathing in mouthfuls of cold air. Where did this tunnel actual lead to? Could it be that there was no end to this path?She really didn\u2019t believe it.Su Luo\u2019s competitive heart was aroused. She dragged her exhausted body, step by step shuffling further into the cave. She walked a full thousand meters, when all of a sudden, her sharp ears heard the sound from the bubbling water of a creek.When Su Luo walked to the place where the sound was coming from, her eyes couldn\u2019t help but open wide, scanning the scene in front of her.At this moment, she thought her own eyes were seeing things.The dark tunnel ended in an unexpectedly large, circular space, which was no less than the size of a basketball court. This empty space appear to be very spacious.At the center of this place was a purple furnace shaped standing cauldron (2). Workbenches formed a circle surrounding the cauldron. Some crystal stones and medicinal herbs were sparsely arranged on the workbenches.1 Niupi candy is a sticky, stretchy caramel like candy usually cut into rectangles and covered in sesame seeds. Here is a Chinese site that shows how you can make it.2 The Chinese character is Ding \u2013 an ancient Chinese standing cauldron used for cooking, serving and storage vessel.

What amazed her was that there were about seven to eight corpses lying in various positions surrounding the workbench. Every corpse was air-dried and withered, as if the owner had passed away a long time ago.It was very clear that these people had been in a very intense fight.Su Luo was in the midst of frowning when suddenly, she sensed danger behind her. Su Luo immediately dropped and rolled on the ground to dodge.\u201cDidn\u2019t know that your survival skills were so great. Even the fall couldn\u2019t kill you!\u201d Nen Lu said as she leaned on the corner wall for support. Her face displayed a duplicitous and furtive smile, full of strong killing intent.In the beginning, Nen Lu was only following orders to kill Su Luo when she attacked the other. However, at this moment, Nen Lu was itching to dismember Su Luo into ten thousand tiny pieces for her own benefit.\u201cAren\u2019t you also still alive?\u201d Su Luo\u2019s smile was as light as a cloud and gentle like the wind. Nevertheless, a trace of apprehension appeared in her heart.The opponent was a third ranked martial artist, while she herself had no spiritual strength. They were both injured, but by observing Nen Lu\u2019s attack a moment ago, Su Luo realized that Nen Lu\u2019s injuries were much lighter than hers.Nen Lu was about to seize this opportunity to kill Su Luo when suddenly, her line of sight turned towards the interior of the room.With just this one look, she was so amazed that her mouth fell open. Then, an ecstatic expression appeared on her face.Nen Lu quickly walked into the room, full of excitement and with an incredulous expression.that looked at everything inside. She kept mumbling to herself. \u201cThis. This can\u2019t be real, right? Could it actually be Zi Huo\u2019s medicinal cauldron? Is it really Zi Huo\u2019s medicinal cauldron?\u201d\u201cWhat is a Zi Huo\u2019s medicinal cauldron?\u201d Su Luo asked, full of curiosity.At this time, Nen Lu already viewed Su Luo as a dead person, so she felt no need to conceal anything from her. Right now, Nen Lu really needed to let out the ecstasy in her heart or else she would go mad from holding it in.\u201cI told you you were a good-for-nothing but you refuse to accept it. You haven\u2019t even heard of Zi Huo\u2019s medicinal cauldron. Zi Huo\u2019s medicinal cauldron is a top-notch divine artifact pursued by all the Apothecaries in the world. If they use this medicinal cauldron to refine medicine, then the rate of success will increase by a hundredfold! Never mind, talking to you is simply like playing a lute to a cow (1). You don\u2019t even know what an Apothecary is, right?\u201dConfronted by Nen Lu\u2019s belittling expression, Su Luo coldly laughed in her heart. Sorry to embarrass you, but this great one actually has a wood-fire dual system and was preparing to level up as an Apothecary.At this moment, Nen Lu looked at Zi Huo\u2019s medicinal cauldron in wonder. Her sword was emitting mysterious rays of light as she murmured to herself. \u201cIt was said that during that time, Elder Zi Huo went into seclusion. Could it be that he finally died here?\u201d\u201cElder Zi Huo?\u201d Su Luo again asked, \u201cWho is he?\u201dNen Lu rolled her eyes. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even heard of Elder Zi Huo? This renowned Elder was the world\u2019s only Grandmaster level Apothecary. Do you know how many famous families and noble clans under the heavens wanted to curry favor with this renowned Elder? Yet you have actually never heard of this Elder Zi Huo. Your stupidity can\u2019t be cured. I really have nothing more to say to you.\u201dSu Luo knew that the continent\u2019s Apothecaries were divided into levels: Elementary Apothecary, Intermediate Apothecary, Advanced Apothecary, Elite Apothecary, as well as Grandmaster Apothecary.It was extremely difficult to advance to the next Apothecary level.However, Apothecaries were rare, thus making every Apothecary extremely precious.Su Manor\u2019s Apothecary was only an Elementary Apothecary, but due to his existence, he was able to ensure that Su Manor did not topple for the past few decades.She never expected that the Elder Zi Huo was the legendary rumored Grandmaster Apothecary. It was indeed hard to imagine.\u201cWow!\u201d Nen Lu, who was lingering in front of the bookshelf ahead, suddenly loudly shrieked, \u201cPrimeval pill recipes! Unexpectedly, \u300aObscure Pill Recipes\u300b(2) is also here! Oh heavens! Jackpot, I really hit the jackpot!\u201d\u300aObscure Pill Recipes\u300b was Elder Zi Huo\u2019s personal notes.

However after having flipped over the entire continent in their search, no one was able to find it. Yet, she would never have imagined that in her hunt for Su Luo she had unexpectedly lucked out. She found \u300aObscure Pill Recipes\u300b, and even Zi Huo\u2019s medicinal cauldron.At this moment, Nen Lu almost went mad with joy!She trembled with jubilation and extreme excitement. She almost jumped up for joy in her elation .She reached out for the\u300aObscure Pill Recipes\u300b, but very quickly she withdrew her hand.She didn\u2019t dare, she was afraid of death.This was because the corpses lying haphazardly on the floor told her that Elder Zi Huo was definitely a poison expert. His belongings definitely could not be encroached upon by just anyone.\u201cYou, come here!\u201d Nen Lu raised her long sword to Su Luo\u2019s neck, coldly glaring at her as if looking at a dead man.\u201cYou want to kill me to silence me?\u201d Su Luo lifted the corner of her lips in a slight smile that was not truly a smile.\u201cKill you to silence you?\u201d Nen Lu laughed out loud. \u201cI definitely will kill you to silence you. Otherwise, if even half a word of what happened here were to spread from your lips, great trouble will befall our Jade Lake Palace. Therefore, you must die.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Su Luo faintly smiled. Just great, she too had a similar notion.\u201cBut right now, you can\u2019t die yet.\u201d Nen Lu used the long sword to threaten Su Luo and bellowed, \u201cBring that\u300aObscure Pill Recipes\u300bover here.\u201dNen Lu wanted to appropriate everything here for herself, but she would not even dare to touch them.Obviously, she was being used as a lab rat! Su Luo felt a chill flashed across her heart; her gaze fell upon the corpses on the floor, one had a dagger stabbed into it.Icy-cold light reflected off the dagger.\u201cFine.\u201d Su Luo did not refuse. She walked over step by step, with a harmless smile on her face.\u201cQuickly pick it up!\u201d Nen Lu coldly commanded.She wanted to use Su Luo to test for poison, to see if this\u300aObscure Pill Recipes\u300bhad any poison on it.Right now, at this crucial moment, she must not die. Discovering Elder Zi Huo\u2019s cave, what other achievement could compare to it? Having this achievement, in the future, even Qing Ning that bitch, would be beneath her.Perhaps, she could take those things and escape to faraway places. This also was not a bad idea, such thoughts quickly flashed through Nen Lu\u2019s mind.Su Luo watched Nen Lu\u2019s constantly changing expressions, and a hint of sneer appeared in her eyes.An inexperienced naive idiot.But the expression on Su Luo\u2019s face remained unchanged, and when her hand touched the book, she silently mouthed, \u201cCollect.\u201dSuddenly, in an instant, the book vanished from the bookshelf.\u201cHuh\u2014 what happened? Where\u2019s the book?\u201d Su Luo pretended to be surprised, and with a expression of having lost her head out of fear, she screamed out loud.Nen Lu\u2019s whole face had a look of utter disbelief.She had kept a very close eye on it just now. Her line of sight never once leaving Su Luo\u2019s hand, yet she could only helplessly watch as that book, in an instant, vanished without a trace.What actually happened? The book was fine, how could it just disappear?This time, I must have seen a ghost!Nen Lu could confirm that during such a short time, Su Luo had no chance to pull off any tricks. It was a pity that no matter how much she speculates, she could never have guessed that Su Luo was unexpectedly a space mage, with her body carrying a portable space.That was why, Nen Lu\u2019s first reaction was to leap to the bookshelf and search for it continuously.At this time, Su Luo was bending over pretending to search for it, but she furtively pulled out the dagger.Seeing that Nen Lu\u2019s whole attention was focused on searching through the\u300aPrimeval Pill Recipes\u300b, the corner of Su Luo\u2019s mouth lifted into an ice-cold, unrestrained, demonic and sly smile.No sooner said than done \u2014\u2014\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was about to turn around when she noticed a shadow rapidly coming towards her. Nen Lu subconsciously tried to block the attack with her hand, tragically causing her right hand to be severed neatly at the wrist. The place of the cut was flat and smooth.Immediately, blood wildly gushed out from the open wound as if it wasn\u2019t vital to Nen Lu\u2019s life!\u201cAhhhhh\u2014\u2014\u201d Only after seeing the severed hand that had fallen on the ground did Nen Lu finally realize what had happened! She screamed out loud in agony.Su Luo was equally unsatisfied with this result.Originally, Su Luo had a well thought out plan: directly stab Nen Lu\u2019s heart through her back. With Su Luo\u2019s speed and accuracy, it wouldn\u2019t be possible for Nen Lu to escape death. Still, who would have known that at the last moment Nen Lu would manage to retain her life.If Nen Lu did an about face and ran right now, she would merely lose a hand but would preserve her life.It\u2019s a pity that Nen Lu was so blinded by her hatred of Su Luo at the moment so she was itching to make mincemeat out of Su Luo to appease the hatred in her heart. Consequently, Nen Lu didn\u2019t even take the time to think before picking up the long sword that had fallen with her dismembered hand while ignoring the pain she felt. She directly charged at Su Luo with a murderous strike.A cold smirk flashed across Su Luo\u2019s eyes. She took out a book from her space and tossed it toward Nen Lu with a smile on her face. \u201cCatch it! Don\u2019t lose it again.\u201d\u201c\u300aObscure Pill Recipes\u300b?\u201d Nen Lu\u2019s eyes opened wide. She stared with stunned amazement at the \u300aObscure Pill Recipes\u300bthat appeared in Su Luo\u2019s hand from out of nowhere. Her attention was momentarily distracted.However, this short split second of carelessness was enough for Su Luo!Immediately after she threw the \u300aObscure Pill Recipes\u300bin Nen Lu\u2019s direction, Su Luo had quickly shifted her body and arrived at Nen Lu\u2019s back like a ghost. While Nen Lu\u2019s attention was momentarily distracted, like a demon from hell, Su Luo raised the new dagger she had picked up and slashed Nen Lu\u2019s neck\u2014\u2014Immediately, blood gushed forth!Nen Lu was staring blankly at the \u300aObscure Pill Recipes\u300bin her hand. Her nails had whitened because she was ready to explode with rage.However, Nen Lu could only watch the unstoppable blood pour out of her neck. She glared at Su Luo with an expression of having suddenly realized something. \u201cSpace, space\u2026.mage\u2026.\u201dAfterwards, with an unreconciled expression, Nen Lu fell backwards. Her eyes were wide open with malevolence. Even in death, they wouldn\u2019t close due to residual resentment.Su Luo grabbed the \u300aObscure Pill Recipes\u300bfrom Nen Lu\u2019s clenched fingers, patted off the dust, and was all smiles as she said. \u201cCorrect, this young lady is a space mage. It\u2019s a pity you only realized it as you were dying. It. Was. Too. Late!\u201dAt this moment, Su Luo was very thankful for her space. In the beginning, she had felt that it was weak. Now, she had slowly discovered its exceptional qualities.After eliminating Nen Lu, Su Luo started to look around for treasure.She stood in front of the bookshelf. The shelves were full of advanced pharmacology books, many of which Su Luo couldn\u2019t comprehend.However, that didn\u2019t matter. She will take all the books back and slowly study them. Su Luo did not grab the books one by one. Instead, she placed the entire bookshelf into her space.Afterwards, Su Luo held her chin and started to circle around Zi Huo\u2019s medicinal cauldron. While circling, she took its measure by looking it up and down. She pondered this medicinal cauldron was nothing special but why was it so heavy?Yes, it was definitely quite heavy.

It was as if the thing was rooted to the ground.If others wanted to take away the medicinal cauldron, it would be extremely difficult. Who knew Su Luo would have the greatest treasure for traveling that others would kill for on her body?Su Luo placed her hand on the edge of the medicinal cauldron and murmured, \u201ccollect.\u201dThus, Zi Huo\u2019s medicinal cauldron, weighing over five thousand kilograms (1), vanished on the spot.Su Luo extended her senses into her space and become somewhat worried.She discovered that after circling the cave and taking everything, that little ten square meters of space had been stuffed full, with barely any space left for her to stand in it.How could she do this? That corner still had a pile of black rocks. She had neither an idea of what it was nor its purpose.Since she couldn\u2019t pack it, then she would just abandon it. She would wait until she was fated to come back here and collect it in the future, Su Luo thought sadly.Hence, she bent over to pick up a few pieces, planning to find someone to analyze it.After all. it was left behind by Elder Zi Huo, something left behind by him, how could it be simple?After throwing exactly three rocks into her space, all of a sudden, Su Luo felt a wave of dizziness. It was a pain that she couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of it, and that almost knocked her off her feet.But this kind of stinging pain left as quickly as it came, it was gone in the blink of an eye.At this moment, Su luo checked her space, and suddenly, her mouth formed an \u201cO\u201d shape.Unexpectedly, this was also possible?Su Luo discovered that her space had grown bigger, even though the change was not obvious. However, at the corner her space, it had actually grown by square meter.This kind of discovery made Su Luo ecstatic.The space can actually get larger?Su Luo\u2019s gaze fell upon the pile of round black stones.Just now, she had put in the medicinal cauldron, books and other materials, and yet the space did not change. However, after putting in those three black little stones, her space changed.Could it be that these rocks were able to increase the size of her space?Whether it was true or not, she could find out by trying again.Su Luo picked up a black rock and threw it in, one piece, two pieces, three pieces\u2026\u201cWhoosh\u2014\u2014\u201dSuddenly, Su Luo felt her head started to ache, it hurt so much that she broke out in cold sweat. But after she opened her eyes, she found that her space had indeed grown bigger by another square meter!It turned out to be true!This discovery allowed Su Luo to put her heart at ease.Without hesitation, she promptly swept up the remaining ten or so stones from the ground into her space, sweeping the floor clean.Hence, her space had widened again by another five square meters.Su Luo was secretly delighted. If there was an opportunity, she would go search for more of these black stones.At this moment, Su Luo had yet to find out what kind of energy actually resided in these black rocks, and how advantageous they would be to her cultivation in the future.However, just as Su Luo was about to leave, she realized that another person was at the entrance. That person was hugging her sword and reclining against the entrance, lips in a sneer, with eyes as cold as a viper unblinkingly staring at her.Su Luo felt her heart jump, silently bemoaning trouble.Just now,she had recklessly swept up all those treasures in the room. Had it possibly been witnessed by her opponent?Since Su Luo could not sense the other\u2019s presence when she arrived, this already proved that that person\u2019s martial skills were a lot better than hers.\u201cSu Luo, your cheap life still has such great luck in surviving!\u201d Er Huang held her double-edged sword, sneering nonstop as she approached Su Luo.Ever since Er Huang had lost Su Luo\u2019s trail, she had continuously searched. Later, she found traces of a fight at the edge of a cliff. Without another word, she shimmied down the creeper vine and searched enroute. Unexpectedly, she had discovered this cave that was a completely different world.However, the most important discovery was of Su Luo\u2019s body.Er Huang would never have imagined, that the legendary good-for-nothing, was actually a space mage that was considered to be extinct on the continent!1) A Chinese Jin = 0.5 kilogram or 1.1 pounds.

Just when she saw the end of the road, at this final juncture, she was intercepted by the enemy forces.This was truly the story of the praying mantis stalking the cicada, unaware of the Black-Naped Oriole bird behind. Moreover, she was the unfortunate hateful praying mantis.Nangong Liuyun had exhorted and warned Su Luo a great number of times before to be cautious and prudent. She must not let the matter of her being a space mage be revealed. Otherwise, her life would be in constant danger.Now, Su Luo\u2019s greatest hidden trump card had been discovered by the Jade Lake fairy\u2019s maid\u2026if this was to leak out\u2026.Su Luo\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. A homicidal determination to obliterate all evidence of her unwitting disclosure appeared in Su Luo\u2019s heart.However, her expression remained calm and collected. Icy rays from the depths of Su Luo\u2019s eyes shot a quick glance at Er Huang. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t go with you?\u201d\u201cDo you really think you have the leeway to choose?\u201d Er Huang condescendingly said while casting disparaging glances at Su Luo.Er Huang\u2019s current situation was like the Venerable Queen up high while Su Luo was merely a ant that she could easily trample on. Su Luo was just a lowly ant that completely lacked the strength to fight back.But, when Er Huang\u2019s vision landed on Nen Lu\u2019s body that was on the ground with eyes full of unresolved resentment staring sightlessly in death, a trace of shock passed through her eyes.Nen Lu had actually been killed?She and Nen Lu had grown up together. They had practiced martial arts together, so Er Huang was very familiar with Nen Lu\u2019s martial arts abilities and knew it was on par with hers. Never in a million years could she have imagined that Nen Lu would die under the hands of the good-for-nothing Su Luo.Nen Lu really had died with unresolved grievances.\u201cLooks like I really underestimated you, slut.\u201d Er Huang cast sidelong glances at Su Luo, gnashing her teeth as her rage burst forth.Er Huang was itching to finish off Su Luo with one sword strike. Regrettably, she could not kill Su Luo now. Su Luo was this continent\u2019s almost extinct space mage. Furthermore, she was also a space mage that did not have any power to protect herself.Er Huang secretly speculated that if she was to take Su Luo to an auction house and sell her, on the basis of this little slut\u2019s innate gift and appearance, shouldn\u2019t she be able to sell for an unpresented sky-high price?It would indeed be a fortune that could tempt a person\u2019s heart.Su Luo examined Er Huang\u2019s constantly changing sinister expressions and also turned her head to look at the corpse of the fallen Nen Lu. A bitter look appeared in Su Luo\u2019s eyes.Her secret having been discovered was disastrous. Due to this, Er Huang would certainly increase her vigilance. Su Luo\u2019s small tricks from before could not be used again.With a bitter smile on her face, Su Luo raised both of her hands in surrender. Er Huang had learned a lesson from Nen Lu\u2019s mistake and as a result had become very cautious.Er Huang took out a dark red blood-colored rope and tied both of Su Luo\u2019s hands behind her back. Er Huang had bound Su Luo so tightly that the joint looked seamless.\u201cBehave. Don\u2019t even think about escaping!\u201d Er Huang warned with a stern voice.Su Luo only made a slight movement. When Er Huang\u2019s icy-cold long sword sliced at her neck, a thin thread of blood slowly seeped out of the cut.Su Luo knew that if she resisted, on account of having killed two of the opponent\u2019s sister-in-arms, Er Huang would probably without a second thought either break or cut off her arms and legs.1) Five thousand kilometer Long March written in Chinese was ten thousand Li (2 Li = 1 kilometer) \u2013 This is a reference to the historical one made by the eventual communist leader Ma Zedong in October of 1934. Before World War II, China had a civil war/internal struggle for power between the Chinese National Party led by Chiang Kai-Shek and the Chinese Red Army of the Communist Party. Chiang Kai-Shek was about to eliminate the red army at Jiang Xi when Ma Zedong and Zhou Enlai led the long march to escape the encirclement. The march was a bitter one that lasted a year with only 10% of the original troops surviving till the end.2) The Chinese characters stated twenty five thousand Li = 125,000 kilometers; I took the figurative meaning here because the Long March was only 9000 kilometers.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
