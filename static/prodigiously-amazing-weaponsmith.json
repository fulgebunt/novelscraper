It was only that pair of chillingly cold eyes that revealed her killing intent.\u201cTen Directional Nightfall Formation! At such a large scale! This Sky Phoenix Jade Ring is merely an incomplete godly armament. I\u2019m afraid that you have wasted your efforts!\u201dThe white clothed male coldly sneered: \u201cDon\u2019t believe for a moment that I don\u2019t know the reason for your visit to the Northern Ice region. It\u2019s all for the sake of finding the Profound Ice Jade to repair the ancient godly armament right?\u201dBoth Huang Yue Li\u2019s heart and mind shook.There was only one person who knew of her trip to the Northern Ice region. That person was the Ling Sect\u2019s eldest young lady, Ling Qing Yu. Could it have been her who had betrayed her? But these two ladies had known each other for many years and had gone through many life and death situations, close bosom friends with many shared secrets between them. So how could it be?Her eyes quickly scanned through the figures of the surrounding people, the corners of her mouth rising.\u201cThe Demonic Sect, Cloud Sea Ancestor and Qi Xing Palace\u2026of the seven powers, three of these great masters have actually gathered here. The allure of the Sky Phoenix Ring is truly great. Unfortunately, even if I did hand the Sky Phoenix Ring to you, there is only one ring\u2026may I ask how will you three will divide it?\u201dThe expression of the white clothed male faltered and became unnaturally stiff. Hurriedly he went to cut her off.\u201cDon\u2019t try to stall for any longer. Before the might of the Ten Directional Nightfall Formation, all will become flames and ashes! All except the godly armament! Now hand the armament over. In respect of your master being the Number One Armament Refiner, I will spare your life if you pledge your loyalty to me!\u201dHuang Yue Li sarcastically laughed: \u201cPledge my loyalty? In your dreams! My, Huang Yue Li\u2019s life-never has relied on others to live!\u201dJust as those dominating words fell, the world lit up in a raging tower of flames. In a blink of an eye, the colour of the land completely transformed.When the white clothed male witnessed this, his complexion became unusually grave. Urgently he cried out: \u201cNot good! She wants to self-destruct!\u201d\u201cNot good!\u201d\u201cQuickly, stop her!\u201dChaotically numerous people attempted to stop her. Unfortunately by the time they had reacted, it was already too late.As an Emperor Profound Realm master, the detonation range of Huang Yue Li\u2019s was enough to wipe out a city. As for those within her immediate surrounding, they naturally would not be able to escape the blast and would be turned to ashes.It was also precisely at that moment was the icy land plunged into darkness accompanied with terrifyingly violent tremors that shook the entire land.About thirty metres away, a black clothed male stood in the air. His body was slim and graceful, with devastatingly exquisite looks that looked to be as perfect as a sculpture. Yet those desolately cold eyes disdainfully looked towards the commotion as he dispelled the incoming and powerful force.Ashen faced were all the people present.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u2026it\u2019s Clan Head Mu\u2026\u2026he\u2026\u2026\u2026he is attacking the formation!\u201d\u201cLooking to die! How could that be? Isn\u2019t he in closed training to ascend to the peak of the Emperor Profound Realm? How could he possibly appear here?\u201dMu Cheng Ying was the publicly acknowledged number one sword expert of the Tian Ling Continent, without compare. It was also widely known that he had been chasing Huang Yue Li for many years now. If it were not for the fact that they knew Mu Cheng Ying was in closed door training, they would not have dared to confront Huang Yue Li.Who could imagine that this man would spare at no effort to rush over thousands of miles to save her!The matchless and tyrannical Ten Directional Nightfall Formation could not withstand even a single blow. With a wave of his hand, the great formation shattered to pieces.\u201cQuickly, escape. Otherwise everyone here will lose their lives!\u201dAll those who had surrounded and attacked Huang Yue Li, turned and scattered.He did not have the time to care about them, and leapt directly to Huang Yue Li\u2019s side.Only, he was still too late.Mu Cheng Ying\u2019s stoic face, which never displayed his emotions, twisted into one of despair and heartbrokenness for the first time.He did not dare to believe his eyes; to believe that he had still come a step late. Helplessly, he looked at the glowing figure of Huang Yue Li.\u201cYue Li\u2014!!!\u201d\u201cWHY\u2026\u2026Why did you do this?! Why did you not wait for me to save you??!\u201dWithin the burning trance, a sliver of Huang Yue Li\u2019s consciousness returned. With that, the picture of Mu Cheng Ying\u2019s outstanding face was the final thing embed into her mind.\u201cI never thought you\u2026would\u2026come\u2026\u2026Thank\u2026\u2026you\u2026\u201dThank you for treating me like this.If there is another chance, I am willing to do whatever necessary to return your undying love.Unfortunately the price of detonating one\u2019s soul was truly great.

From within, came faint sounds.\u201cThird Miss, you\u2026\u2026you died so unjustly\u2026\u2026how could you not think this through properly\u2026\u2026\u201dThe crying made Huang Yue Li highly agitated and wanted her to shut up. Yet no matter how much she struggled, she could not muster any strength.An intense female shriek sounded out: \u201cStupid servant girl, hurry up and scram for this lady!\u201d\u201cI cannot! Fourth Miss, you cannot act like this! Third Miss\u2019 body has yet to turn cold and you already want to seize her property. These were all left behind by the old lord!\u201d\u201cWhat can you do about it? This slut has already died! Now those things of hers belong to my Bai family. Hurry and scram for me, or I\u2019ll give the order to whip you to death and let you accompany that slut of yours!\u201dThen Bai Ruo Yan proceeded to kick the eyesore of a serving girl as she commanded: \u201cMove everything away for me and be careful. You really couldn\u2019t tell that this slut would possess so many good things. Just this porcelain pill bottle, not even I possess one. Move everything out!\u201d\u201cYou really cannot Fourth Miss! All of my Young Miss\u2019 possessions have already been taken away. Only that vase remains, and that was something the previous lord left behind\u2026\u2026\u201d The faithful serving girl threw herself forward once again.\u201cLowly servant! Dare to block my way! Beat her to death!\u201dThis ear piercing dispute unceasingly entered Huang Yue Li\u2019s ears, sending waves of sharp pain coursing through her brain. Following the pain came a rush of memories that did not belong to her.It appeared that she had been reborn.The body of Bai Ruo Li was the Third Young Miss of the Wu Wei Manor, from the South Yue Country. Her father Bai Liu Feng once held the title of number one expert in the South Yue country, his prowess brilliant. From birth, she was above the masses, a greatly respected princess.Unexpectedly when she was three years old, her father disappeared when he was leading his troops. Her second uncle Bai Liu Jing then inherited the position, pulling down Bai Ruo Li\u2019s status by a thousand miles. Finally on her tenth birthday, she was revealed to be completely ungifted at cultivation, a complete waste.In this martial world, the strong ruled the Tian Ling Continent. Not being able to cultivate meant that you had reached the very bottom of the ladder. From then on, Bai Rou Li was utterly bullied and humiliated by her female cousins from her Second Uncle\u2019s side.The morning before yesterday, her second cousin hosted a birthday celebration. As for Bai Ruo Li who was rushing to attend the event, she was assaulted by a passing male, her reputation falling to rock bottom.Afterwards, Bai Ruo Li was extremely ashamed for the adultery rumors that had spread. That very night, she committed suicide by hanging herself.As for Huang Yue Li, she mysteriously and unknowingly awoke in this body replacing her.From outside the door, the sound of the whip smashing down on raw skin became increasingly clear. The blood curdling cries also became increasingly mournful.With large strides, Bai Ruo Yan advanced sneering: \u201cOh, my Third Sister isn\u2019t a princess for nothing. This jade pendant on her neck is a body recovering soul jade! It is such a waste to give to this useless trash such a rare treasure! It better if this miss had it instead!\u201dAs she proclaimed this, her hands had already reached towards Huang Yue Li\u2019s neck.However, just as those thin nails were about to come in contact with skin, the motionless young girl\u2019s eyes abruptly opened.Bai Ruo Yan froze. Making contact with that pair of profoundly black eyes, she felt as if she was staring straight into a dark hole, instantly taking all her breath away.She only felt her mind buzz a bit before it became completely blank!You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

From behind her, a cry of fright could be heard as the servants stuttered: \u201cG\u2026\u2026ggg\u2026\u2026ghost!!!\u201dDeathly pale was Bai Ruo Yan\u2019s face. So full of fright, her butt plonked straight pnto the floor. She was wholly unable to stand and could only furiously nudge her butt towards the door.Chuckling, the corners of Huang Yue Li\u2019s mouth rose up.This eye technique could not turn her into a ghost. Instead, it brought out Bai Rou Yan\u2019s deepest and darkest fears.It was hard to imagine that the seemingly arrogant and despotic Bai Rou Yan held such fears. Fears of the third elder sister, whom she bullied to return and haunt her.Truly as the saying goes, vile people have no courage!Just a moment ago she was calling slut this, slut that. Did she think that this stately princess was on the same level as a lowly servant? This easily bullied?If she did not properly return this favor, then she would be disrespecting the sincere care and concern this younger cousin has given her, over the past years.Alighting from the bed, Huang Yue Li leisurely approached Bai Ruo Yan.Bai Ruo Yan could only cry out in alarm: \u201cYou\u2026\u2026don\u2019t come near me! Leave! Get away from me!\u201dVoice hushed, Huang Yue Li\u2019s mouth curved into an extremely demonic smile: \u201cBai Ruo Yan, you were the one to murder me. Even if I become a ghost, I will not let you go\u2026\u2026\u201dForcing Bai Ruo Yan into a corner, her icy cold hand reached out and clasped her thin neck.Fearful screeches and cries could be as Bai Ruo Yan pleaded for mercy: \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u2026don\u2019t kill me! Don\u2019t kill me! The murderer was not\u2026me\u2026\u2026it\u2026it was Second Sister\u2026\u2026\u2026it was Second Sister and Second Madam! It has nothing to do with me, yes, I don\u2019t know anything!\u201dThe tinkling laughter that Huang Yue Li released sounded both sinister and strange.\u201cThen why\u2026\u2026what is the reason in coming to my room? Wanting to steal my property? It looks\u2026\u2026it seems to me that you are a shameless woman who would murder for riches. \u201d\u201cNo, no, no\u2026\u2026it really wasn\u2019t me.\u201dWhen she felt the tightening constriction of the ice cold fingers around her neck, Bai Ruo Yan fell into a state of panic. In a great flurry, she had revealed everything.\u201cIt really has nothing to do with me\u2026\u2026\u2026wu\u2026\u2026it was Second Sister who me told to come. It was her who told me to find a key and said that everything else would belong to me. Third Sister\u2026\u2026\u2026I momentarily possessed a greedy heart, please believe me. All debts would have its debtor. The one who spread those rumors about you committing adultery really had nothing to do with me\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHuang Yue Li snarled: \u201cDaring to eye my possessions\u2026\u2026you equally deserve to die!\u201dHer fingers tightened.This caused Bai Rou Yan to start shrieking again: \u201cPlease don\u2019t! Third Elder Sister\u2026\u2026Third Elder Sister, spare me. I will return everything back to you\u2026\u2026\u201dAs she said this, she flusteredly flung out all the items she had taken from within her clothes.\u201c\u2026\u2026I have returned everything to you. I beg Third Sister to be generous and spare me!\u201dSweeping across the thing scattered across the floor. She didn\u2019t loosen her hand and directly questioned: \u201cAnything else?\u201d\u201cAnything else?\u201dPuzzled, Bai Ruo Yan\u2019s eyes became blank as she tried to recall. Everything she had previously taken were all returned, so what was left?Since she was unable to remember anything else, she started desperately take out everything within her possession. She took out money, jewellery and even the hairpins on her head.\u201cThird Sister, I have taken out everything that was on me.

How could you possibly be this poor? Could it be that you\u2019re still hiding some items?\u201d\u201cThird\u2026\u2026Third Sister\u2026\u2026I really didn\u2019t hide anything\u2026\u2026\u201dKnitting her brows together, Huang Yue Li continued her interrogation: \u201cNo money? Touch your heart and ask yourself whether or not if you truly have no money left? Look around and view the damage you have caused. If you do not make the proper compensations, how can my spirit possibly allow you to walk away freely?\u201d She scoffed and looked at Bai Ruo Yan with narrowed eyes.Shuddering from those words, Bai Ruo Yan\u2019s words were shaky as she replied: \u201cThird Sister\u2026\u2026\u2026I really\u2026\u2026really don\u2019t have any money. Second Sister\u2026\u2026she has money, so\u2026\u2026so go and ask her\u2026\u2026\u201d She pleaded desperately.\u201cSeems like you really are poor. Why don\u2019t write up an IOU then.\u201dBai Ruo Yan blinked in confusion.\u201cWhat?\u201dLowering her head, Huang Yue Li swiftly wrote on a piece of paper and threw it towards Bai Ruo Yan.Due to fact that Bai Ruo Yan was overwhelmed with fear, she did not even stop to think for a moment why a ghost would ask for money. She didn\u2019t even read the contents on the piece paper, but proceeded to the snatch the brush and signed her name down immediately.Picking the paper up, Huang Yue Li scanned it before nodding in approval and said in a satisfied tone: \u201cFine, then we\u2019ll reluctantly let you owe the money for now. Take off your clothes and kowtow to me three times, then you can scram!\u201dBai Ruo Yan was momentarily stunned.\u201cWhat? Take off my clothes?\u201dEven if she could not think properly due to fear, she still knew that if a young lady took off all her clothes, there would be very severe consequences.Unfortunately when Bai Ruo Yan looked into Huang Yue Li\u2019s endless eyes, it was as if what remaining bit of consciousness she had left was sucked away.Under the control of the Clear Sky Eye, Bai Ruo Yan didn\u2019t not have the slightest resistance. Obediently, she acted according to Huang Yue Li\u2019s instructions.Listlessly, she undressed in front of Huang Yue Li and knelt to the ground. She then proceeded to kowtow three times.Dong! Dong! Dong!Clear, crisp knocks could be heard as she powerfully banged her head against the limestone floor.By the time she lifted her head up, her skin on her forehead was torn and blood was trickling down.Waving her hand, Huang Yue Li commanded: \u201cScram!\u201dHearing those words, Bai Ruo Yan leapt up and madly dashed towards the door as if she had received a great pardon. Bursting through the door, she furiously ran away.Outside, the serving girsl and nurse that Bai Ruo Yan had brought along with her were still immersed in their grand scheme as they surrounded Bai Ruo Li\u2019s serving girl and continued their torture.\u201cI\u2019ll whip this damn wretch to death! Dare to go against our Fourth Miss? You didn\u2019t even stop to look around before peeing. What status does your Mistress have!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! The ill star of the deceased Master and Mistress. Not to mention that she is a complete cultivation trash! If it weren\u2019t on the fact of being kin, Master would not have kept her. This is already showing great benevolence. But who knew, that she would dare to commit adultery with a random man. That\u2019s truly losing the face of this entire Manor! Even death cannot wipe such a stain away!\u201d\u201cJust a lowly and disgraceful thing, yet she still has the audacity to refuse and hand out the items that the previous Master had left behind? Hmph, moreover she still has the cheek to keep it all to herself. But now that she\u2019s dead, everything is settled. So everything here would naturally belong to our Manor!\u201cThird\u2026\u2026Third Miss\u2026\u2026she isn\u2019t that kind of person!\u201dEven though she was covered in blood and barely breathing, she stubbornly clung on to her last breaths and struggled in a weak voice in an attempt to clear her Mistress\u2019 name.It was at that moment that a sudden shriek erupted from within the room, followed by a loud bang as the doors flung open. Hearing the commotion, they all turned their head to only see a naked silhouette flying out.\u201cWho is it?\u201d Observing closely, the serving girls asked before crying out: \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u2026Fourth Miss. What happened to Fourth Miss? What happened?\u201dBai Ruo Yan looked completely disheveled. Her hair completely in disarray and matted with dust, not a single accessory was seen, and blood was trickling down her forehead. It was too hideous to look at. Still trembling, she cried out deliriously: \u201cGhost\u2026\u2026spare me Third Sister\u2026\u2026spare me\u2026it wasn\u2019t me who harmed you.

With large strides, she stood in front of Bai Ruo Yan and said: \u201cFourth Mis, don\u2019t panic. By this old maid\u2019s assumption, Third Miss isn\u2019t a ghost. Who dare to pretend in our manor to be some godly spiri\u2026\u2026ghost\u2026\u2026\u201dOnce again, Huang Yue Li\u2019s demonically black eyes glinted coldly. Looking towards her, the old maid felt her head became dizzy while her legs crumpled beneath her, kneeling to the ground.Softly, Huang Yue Li whispered: \u201cEveryone give yourselves twenty slaps then get lost!\u201dThe sounds of slapping ensued. Under the control of Huang Yue Li\u2019s eye technique, the various serving girls and maids started to diligently slap themselves. Pa! Pa! Pa! It sounded. By the end of the twenty slaps, everyone\u2019s faces had swelled up greatly, causing them to look like steamed buns!Following that, those people hurriedly stood up. They didn\u2019t even spare a glance at the bare naked Bai Ruo Yan, running away as if they had peed their pants.Quivering, shaking, Bai Ruo Yan staggered. All the while muttering \u201cghost\u201d as she tottered out of the courtyard.With slow and unhurried steps, Huang Yue Li followed behind them to the entrance.At the entrance to the street, many people came and left.With a clear and audible voice, Huang Yue Li shouted out: \u201cCome see. Wu Wei Manor\u2019s Fourth Miss is running around the streets naked! A high standing young lady with fair skin, great bodily features. Not bad and it costs no money!\u201dSuddenly, a naked lady burst out scaring all in the vicinity before drawing their attention.When everyone heard the loud shouts of Huang Yue Li, they couldn\u2019t help but well with great anticipation. Standing in a circle, people started to gather and surround Bai Ruo Yan from all sides. Not only was she trapped within the circle, more and more people started to gather and chatter amongst themselves.\u201cEh, this crazy lady actually looks quite decent, her body too. Just a shame, that she\u2019s a bit lacking in the brains. Nonetheless, I have a younger brother who is a bit retarded, thirty and he has yet to marry a wife. I wonder if I can take her home and match her him?\u201d\u201cWoah, you sure dream well! Didn\u2019t you hear what the person just said? She is Wu Wei Manor\u2019s Fourth Miss. Even if she was an idiot, do you think your brother can match her?\u201d\u201cWhat? How could this be? I only heard that the Third Miss of Wu Wei Manor was useless. Aren\u2019t the Fourth Miss\u2019 talents quite decent? How could she be an idiot? Not to mention, running around the street naked?\u201d\u201cBut, it seems like it really Fourth Miss Bai ah\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? What? You didn\u2019t see wrongly?\u201d\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t see wrongly! My uncle\u2019s next door neighbour\u2019s great aunt\u2019s younger male cousin from her mother\u2019s side\u2019s older sister-in-law\u2026\u2026is part of Wu Wei Manor\u2019s household. How could I possibly be wrong? This is precisely Fourth Miss Bai!\u201d\u201cTruly so? How could this high class, well-bred lady be running around naked?\u201d\u201cHow would I know that?\u201d\u201cHey, hey. I heard that these rich ladies from good households are slutty from birth and have unique hobbies. Not only do like to go around streaking, they also enjoy being beaten. I heard that some even enjoy eating sh**\u2026abnormal hobbies, normal folk cannot understand ah\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAi! Stop talking about, I\u2019m about to puke. Public morals are degenerating by the day\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter shouting till her voice turned hoarse, Huang Yue Li proceeded to sneakily hide herself.No one would have guessed that there are a young girl sitting at the back entrance of the Manor. Chin resting on her hands, she listened enthusiastically.\u201cTsk tsk. This small country South Yue isn\u2019t very strong and its cultivators are also beyond weak. Yet its streets\u2019 uncles are so informed, informed to point where they knew that some people enjoyed eating sh**.\u201dAt that moment in time, Bai Ruo Yan became clear headed again.Current Schedule : 6 Regular Happy Doses a week.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Very quickly she realised that she had unknowingly walked out into the street without a single article of clothing on her. Not to mention that she was currently being encircled by a large ground of people.Out of instinct, Bai Ruo Yan let out a loud scream. Frantically she tried to used her hands to cover herself up. Unfortunately, if she covered the bottom, she couldn\u2019t cover the top.Embarrassed to death she shouted out loudly: \u201cWhat are you doing? Perverts! Scram, all of you scram!\u201dAs she shouted this, she used all her strength to escape.When she had arrived at a lone corner, her foot suddenly slipped. Fortunately she narrowly avoided falling face down.The crowd behind her was still discussing away.\u201cYi? Don\u2019t run. I still haven\u2019t seen enough! Don\u2019t you enjoy being seen by others?\u201d\u201cF***, did you guys hear what she just said? She actually called us perverts? Who in the end is the real pervert?\u201dSeeing the main lead runaway, Huang Yue Li\u2019s eyes dimmed, rapidly losing interest. Standing up, she brushed the dust from off her butt and prepared to leave.Just as she was about to step into the doorway, she halted her steps.\u201cStrange. Why I do feel as if someone is watching me?\u201dTurning around, she quickly scanned for any peculiarities. Seeing none, she turned around again. As she was about to step through the doorway, an immense pressure descended upon her.Her entire being shook.The next second, a mysteriously clothed male appeared from around the corner.He wore a silvery white mask that covered the majority of his face. Only his perfectly chiseled jaw could be seen. His long, black hair hung loosely down, while his cold, thin lips curved upwards, giving off a slightly demonic impression.Just by revealing his lower jaw and his fair skin was enough to make one possess wild thoughts, guessing away at his appearance. What type of face lay under that mask. What outstanding features he possessed, enough for one to lose their soul.With a gaze of interest, he pulled on Huang Yue Li.Within those pupils held a intense power that cause one unconsciously to shudder.Huang Yue Li\u2019s instinct sensed danger.Even though her soul had exploded once and could not compare to before, she still could sense danger. It was definitely something ordinary people could not compare to.Raising her head, she gave the male an icy glare and snapped: \u201cHave you seen enough?\u201dStroking his chin, he replied: \u201cHaven\u2019t seen enough.\u201dThey all said that Wu Wei Manor\u2019s Third Miss was both a cowardly and weak good for nothing person; not a single good point. Presently with the truth in front of him, it seems that the rumors differed vastly.This Third Miss seemed to have used a secret technique to control that girl previously. Her spirit was quite powerful. Not matter how you look at it, she did not seem to be good for nothing.Moreover, she was quite two faced, quite nefarious\u2026\u2026\u2026This barbed wild rose, although it had yet to bloom had already opened his eyes.Seeing that he had no evil intentions, Huang Yue Li snorted: \u201cIf you haven\u2019t seen enough then take you time to look. This lady shall not keep you company!\u201dWatching her receding back, the usually frosty face of the man, revealed a rare smile.\u201cTruly a small fox\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026As soon as Huang Yue Li stepped into the courtyard again, she was greeted with the view of Bai Ruo Li\u2019s things. They were messily left about by the servants earlier.This caused her to wrinkle her brows: \u201cDo they even know about hygiene? They actually threw them everywhere, making me go to the trouble to tidy it up. If I had know earlier, I would have made them slap themselves somemore before allowing them to leave!\u201dIt was that moment that Cai Wei regained consciousness. She then immediately threw herself to Huang Yue Li\u2019s leg side. Clutching onto her leg, she began to wail loudly.\u201cMy Third Miss ah\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026you died so unjustly\u2026\u2026\u2026it\u2019s no wonder that you spirit did not leave and possesses consciousness\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dCurrent Schedule : 6 Regular Happy Doses a week.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just previously when she was being pressed again the wooden bench and getting beaten to death, she did not forget to protect her Mistress. It was just a shame, it seemed like her brain wasn\u2019t too good and thought she was actually a ghost?Cai Wei was still wailing away at her feet: \u201cThird Miss, if you were this strong while alive, how great that would be! If the old master knew that you were killed at such a young age, how heartbroken he would be\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dUnable to bear the increasingly tragic cries, Huang Yue Li yelled out in exasperation: \u201cStop\u2026\u2026stop! Stop! Don\u2019t wail for the departed anymore, your family\u2019s miss isn\u2019t dead yet! Can you not speak such depressing words!\u201dCai Wei abruptly raised her head and stuttered: \u201cWhat? Young Miss\u2026\u2026Young Miss isn\u2019t dead?\u201dLips curving upwards, Huang Yue Li smiled: \u201cOf course I not dead. If I died, then wouldn\u2019t those who cause my death be delighted? Those people who treated me unjustly are still living happily. How could I die just like that? I\u2019m well and alive!\u201dAfter raising her head, Cai Wei stopped to observe for quite a while before exclaiming out: \u201cYoung Miss, you didn\u2019t die\u2026\u2026you really didn\u2019t die! Your body is still warm!\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201d As Huang Yue Li flicked her sleeve and turned to walk back towards her room she proclaimed: \u201cIn the future, don\u2019t cry so easily and lose your Miss\u2019 face! Whomever bullies us, you should fiercely retaliate!\u201dEyes wide in shock, Cai Wei thought that a big change had happened. Not only was Third Miss\u2019 life was strong and survived this ordeal, her entire person seemed to have changed.In the past, when the second household came and bullied them, Third Miss would only secretly cry. She would lament that she had led a tough life from childhood; both parents dying when young and a wastrel at cultivation. She would so say that was reason why people bullied her.Now she says to hit them back. And she had just scared away the Fourth Miss who had reached the fourth stage of the Qi Profound Realm!Cai Wei moved to tears: \u201cGod really has foresight!\u201dShe was known throughout. As the daughter of the infamous number one expert of the Southern Yue Kingdom, how could the Third Miss be an easily bullied wastrel?\u201cWhy are still standing there making such a fuss at the entrance for? Hurry up and come in.\u201dHastily, Cai Wei pushed opened the doors and entered.Presently, Huang Yue Li had bent down to pick up a small white bottle. Pulling off stopper off, she held it under her nose and took a whiff while she reached out to open Cai Wei\u2019s mouth: \u201cAlthough those whips lashes had only caused superficial wounds, they still affected the muscles and bones. If you do not properly treat those wounds now, then they could cause problems in cultivation later.\u201dCai Wei\u2019s mind momentarily blanked out: \u201cYoung Miss, what did you just say? Cultivation? This lowly is but a servant, so I don\u2019t have the qualifications to cultivate. Even if I do have some bone and muscles injuries, it is okay.\u201dIgnoring these words, Huang Yue Li poured out three pea-sized pellets from within the bottle. She then instructed: \u201cTake these Blood Clotting Pills. By tomorrow morning, your wounds would have fully healed.\u201dCai Wei\u2019s eyes widen, just like they were popping out of their socket: \u201cThird\u2026\u2026Third Miss, these are high grade pills ah! Just one of these pills can cost up to two hundred taels! Even if you have the money, you may not necessarily be able to purchase it! This half bottle was something the Old Lord left behind for you. Quickly put them away! This is a precious family treasure!\u201dHuang Yue Li furrowed her brows: \u201cThey are merely the lowest of the lowest grade pills. Is there a need for such a reaction? Precious family treasure as well? Fine, if i tell you to eat them, then eat them and don\u2019t waste them. This lady is still waiting for you to serve me.\u201dWithout waiting for any remarks, she directly stuffed the pills into Cai Wei\u2019s mouth.Mustering all her strength, Cai Wei tilted her head to the side in attempt to dodge her family\u2019s Miss. Unfortunately she was still too slow. Before she knew it, her mouth was stuffed with the pills.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Tomorrow morning, clean up the courtyard. It has been completely trashed by those dirty people. You truly can not continue to live here.\u201dOn the other hand, Cai Wei still possessed that lifeless expression of hers. She really couldn\u2019t believe that she had just\u2026\u2026had just swallowed three high grade Blood Clotting Pills!!!Did the Young Miss not know how precious those were? Even if one was part of the royal household, they still wouldn\u2019t randomly give servants pills; let alone high grade ones! Not to mention that fact that she had swallowed three of them for merely a flesh injury!Even if you want to ruin the family, you wouldn\u2019t ruin it like this!Did the Young Miss think that medicinal pills were like cabbages, growing everywhere?Originally she thought that her family\u2019s Young Miss had become clear-headed. What she didn\u2019t realise was, she had only become more foolish??It was only when Cai Wei had blankly shuffled out of the room, did Huang Yue Li dawn on an extremely serious expression.She truly could not think of anything else as she pondered. Just how did she snatch an opportunity for rebirth!When was she was at the Extreme Northern Region, she was pursed by the masters of several powerful sects due to the godly Sky Phoenix Ring. Consequently, she was also humiliated by falling into their ambush, resulting in her choice of self-detonation.Logically speaking, the normal ending would be her soul dissipating. So how, how did she enter this body?Additionally, who betrayed her to fall into that trap?Even after considering all possibilities for quite some time, Huang Yue Li still could not come through with a suitable answer. Since she could not solve it, she put it aside for now.\u2018Nevermind. Since I was able to come back, it is still a good thing.\u2019\u2018Currently, the most important task I must do is to quickly strengthen myself and reach my previous power.\u2019Her current strength was pitiful beyond pitiful. Even an insignificant girl at fourth level of the Qi Profound Realm could act like a big shot in front of her. How could she possibly talk about taking revenge and wiping this grudge away?Furthermore, since she had taken possession of Bai Ruo Li\u2019s body, she must teach those scums who had killed Bai Ruo Li a proper lesson. That way, it would also a be a form of repayment to her.With a plan in mind, Huang Yue Li crossed her legs on the bed and began to meditate.Wu Wei Manor had thoroughly used all their power to suppress her. Even the cultivation manuals that their family had passed down through the age had not been given to her.Fortunately within Huang Yue Li\u2019s eyes, those cultivation manuals of the Bai family were much too basic and coarse.The first step in cultivation was to absorb qi. You must meld the profound qi within the heaven and earth into your body and meridians.One must then allow the profound qi to pass through all twelve of the meridians, completing one full circuit. This would cleanse the body of all the impurities within and entering the first level. Once you are able to do this, you have successfully entered into the ranks of martial practitioners, becoming one of the most elementary practitioners.This process was extremely tedious.Even to a first grade talent who had started from the young age of ten, would need at least three years to link up all their channels.As for Bai Ruo Yan, she was a second grade talent and was rare for someone of her age, fourteen, to reach the fourth level of the Qi Profound Realm. Due to this, she did not put Bai Rou Li in her eyes.In her previous life, Huang Yue Li was an inheriting disciple to one of the Four Great Hidden Sacred Grounds, the Fire Temple. She possessed the universally shocking ninth grade talent, enabling her to link all her meridians within a single night. In the history of the Tian Ling Continent, she was the second genius of that tier.She casually reminisced a bit about her past life\u2019s cultivation path before drawing on the qi around her.However, from the afternoon all the way to nightfall, she was not able to sense even a single thread of profound qi.With the passing of time, Huang Yue Li\u2019s expression also became increasingly ugly.Even when she had awoken, Huang Yue Li could sense that this body was very weak, bursting with weakness, super-ultra weak! But she had still underestimated the seriousness of the problem.One in two people usually possessed only a bit of talent. Even those who possessed first grade talent could, with time and effort sense a sliver of worldly profound qi. Not to mention that fact that she was currently cultivating with a peak level Saint Grade Upper Level method. In spite of all this, she could not sense anything??This Bai Rou Li really was peak grade trash!You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Reasonably, no matter how untalented she was, she shouldn\u2019t be a complete waste.Could there some sort of problem?Numerous possibilities flashed through Huang Yue Li\u2019s mind immediately. These possibilities were all related to curing talentless people. Unfortunately, she felt that all these would not have any effect.Just as she was frustrating over this problem, she heard a loud thunderous clap resounding in her ear!Following that, Huang Yue Li felt herself lose consciousness. When she came to, she found herself in a simple adorned room. Right in front of her, was a raging inferno.At the centre of the inferno, was an gigantic silhouette.She squinted her eyes, trying to discern what that was. Huang Yue Li\u2019s eyes popped out as soon as she recognised it-it was like those portrayed in the legends! It was a mythical phoenix!As its shimmering golden wings unfolded, it seemed as if they could rip apart space itself. As it lightly waved it\u2019s wings, the wind blew over like a raging tide, a pressure borne down it\u2019s surroundings, making it hard to breath.Raising its head, the phoenix let out a clear and melodious cry. Sweet and graceful it sounded, yet brimming with power as it emanated a domineering aura.Suddenly, the flames started to whirl about furiously as the golden silhouette of the phoenix gradually shrunk in size. Amidst the golden light, it morphed into the shape of a young man clothed in a long golden robe.He had a handsome yet devilish looking face, complemented with a complexion as fair as white jade. That pair of peach blossom eyes perfectly matched that defined nose and seductive thin lips. In regards to his five facial features, there was no flaw you could pick on.That long robe he wore was only casually draped across his body, fully revealing his upper torso. This gave off an air of languidness.Because Huang Yue Li had witness the entire spectacle, she knew that this loosely robed male was the incarnation of that Phoenix. With peerless strength, he was definitely not the man he portrayed himself to be; a harmless but good looking man.Looking at Huang Yue Li, a flash of discontent flashed across his eyes.\u201cGirl, what are not you showing the least bit of admiration towards this deity?\u201d\u201cHah?\u201d This statement left Huang Yue Li at a loss.The man went on: \u201cAs a revered deity, and with such striking elegance, dashing and charismatic, am I not the very personification of beauty itself to you?\u201dHuang Yue Li was left speechless. It was only after much thought and time did she finally find some words as she spat out: \u201cI have met narcissists, but I have never met someone who is shameless to such a degree\u2026\u2026\u201dThe man who had just morphed from a phoenix, although indeed exceptionally handsome and dashing, but if his good looks was to be said to be the very personification of beauty, that would be an overstatement.In her previous life, within the Emperor\u2019s city, were the Ten Great Gods. Each and every one of them possessed outworldly looks and charm. As for Mu Cheng Ying, he was the undisputed first rank.Expression changing, the male\u2019s eye narrowed.\u201cGirl, you dare disrespect this deity? Do you not know that if this deity wants to kill you, it would be as simple as squishing an\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026ant\u2026\u2026\u201dThe male was originally overbearing and arrogant. But as he was in the middle of his sentence, he suddenly came to a pause. Even his expression had changed greatly.Flabbergasted, Huang Yue Li asked: \u201cHey, what happened to you?\u201dUnder the dumbstruck gaze of Huang Yue Li\u2019s, the phoenix male rapidly transformed. Bit by bit, he shrunk in size; even his facial features underwent great change.Finally, he became a young a boy who was around three heads tall. You could still see the evilness within his face, but those big, round and watery eyes, with those marshmallowy cheeks clearly stated: \u201cBody - delicate, form - soft and strength - weak! Fresh, cute, soft skin!\u201dThe young boy looked down at his little hands, and panickedly cried out: \u201cFu*k! I had clearly absorbed Profound Qi for entire day. How could it only last for such a short time before I changed back!\u201dHearing those words, Huang Yue Li narrowed her eyes. Squatting next to the young boy, she raised her eyebrows and said: \u201cGood. In the end, you are just a small brat playing tricks. Tell me, why after cultivating an entire day, I am not even able to sense the slightest bit of Profound Qi!\u201dYou can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Pouting his bun-like face, he struggled desperately.\u201cLet me down! I said LET ME DOWN! Stinking girl! Country bumpkin! I\u2019m warning you, if you don\u2019t release me now and kneel down to beg for forgiveness, I will make you regret it!\u201dChuckling, Huang Yue Li replied: \u201cOh, your age is small, but your temper isn\u2019t. A naughty child is itching for a lecture. Watch out or I\u2019ll smack your butt!\u201dOn the young boy\u2019s adorable face, was an expression of apprehension. This caused him to use more effort in his struggle to escape. Shouting out: \u201cStinking girl! Just you wait! You also saw it, this little lord\u2019s true form was that formidable and majestic phoenix. Currently, it\u2019s because I don\u2019t possess enough Profound Qi resulting in my temporary small form. Wait until this little one has recovered. By then, I only need one finger to squash you!\u201d\u201cSo amazing?\u201dLips curling upwards, Huang Yue Li loosened her grip. This action nearly caused the plump, round body of the boy to fall and land straight on his bottom.The cute boy hurriedly grabbed onto her arm, not daring to let go. His entire body trembled non-stop, yet he still continued roaring: \u201cYou want to kill this little lord! Just you wait!\u201dHuang Yue Li replied: \u201cJust then, were you not the one who kept asking me to let you go? So why don\u2019t you want me to let go now?\u201dThe boy could only give her a deathly glare.Continuing, Huang Yue Li said: \u201cEnough, don\u2019t act anymore. I already saw through it, that phoenix image wasn\u2019t yours, was it?\u201d\u201cOf course that was me!\u201d\u201cThe phoenix is an ancient mythological beast, with matchless power. If you were really that matured phoenix, even if you were gravely injured, you would still be able to make me kneel and cough out blood from your gaze alone. Is there a need for such threats? I think that this is probably a memory of a past senior that you took to act like that, right?\u201dThe cute boy: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe two people had a standoff for quite sometime, before the boy finally admitted his defeat.\u201cOkay\u2026\u2026\u2026fine\u2026\u2026\u2026stinking girl. Looks like you still possess some brains\u2026\u2026even though\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026even though that image wasn\u2019t mine, it was still my older brother\u2019s!\u201dFlabbergasted, Huang Yue Li asked: \u201cThat was your older brother? That\u2019s not possible right? Anyone could see that was an expert, while you\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026children should just be honest. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame this older sister when she gives a proper lesson.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t lie!\u201d Infuriated, the child flared up as he spilled everything out. \u201cEven though my age is young, I am still a authentic, pure-blooded phoenix! When I grow up, I will be as dashing and as awesome as my older brother!\u201dStill unconvinced, Huang Yue Lie continued her questioning: \u201cYou spirit is this weak. No matter how you look at it, you do not seem to be an ancient mythological beast?\u201dSincerely and grievingly stated: \u201cI really am a phoenix. I am just still a child. When I was just born, there was a great battle. Bringing me with him, brother ran far away, far away. Later, we had met great danger. In order to protect me, brother sealed my soul in the Sky Phoenix Ring\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHold up, hold up. In other words, we are currently inside the Sky Phoenix Ring??\u201dHuang Yue Li couldn\u2019t help but cry out in shock.In her previous life, ever since she had found the Sky Phoenix Ring in an ancient remnant, she had used and tried all sorts of heavenly treasures and methods to make it recognise her as its master. Yet now, without rhyme or reason, it was activated?Puffing out his chest, the cute boy proclaimed: \u201cHumph! Humph! That\u2019s right! The Sky Phoenix Ring isn\u2019t some ordinary God Relic. Blood alone isn\u2019t enough for it to recognise a master, you must separate a part of your soul and let it merge with ring for it to work. Your luck isn\u2019t bad. When you detonated your soul, you allowed yourself to be recognised as its master!\u201dYou can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In other words, even though I destroyed my soul, yet I was able to snatch a chance to be reborn\u2026This was all due to the Sky Phoenix Ring?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u2026there is no method of saving someone when they destroy their soul. Even the Sky Phoenix Ring does not possess this ability. When you were detonating your soul, I was still unconscious. By the time I awoke, you were already recognised as its master. It was at this moment, Bai Ruo Li who possessed the heaven defying Flame Spirit Physique appeared. So I used what little amount of Profound Qi I possessed and rushed out.\u201dAbsorbing the information, Huang Yue Li felt as if her mind was submerged in a cloudy mist.The Sky Phoenix Ring, such a high grade Godly Relic was still unable to save a destroyed soul. So, in the end, how did she survive?Very quickly, she discovered another strange point.\u201cLittle brat, did you make a mistake? What physique did you say Bai Rou Li possessed? Clearly she was a peak grade trash!\u201dImmediately, the small boy put on a disdainful expression: \u201cWhat do you understand? This physique of Bai Rou Li\u2019s, even if you were to compare it in the God Realm, it would still be very dominating, extremely heaven-defying!\u201d\u201cTruly so?\u201d Huang Yue Li was full of doubt.Angry, the small boy bursted out: \u201cOf course! In your Lower Realm, a ninth grade talent is already a peak level genius. Yet in the God Realm, the peak grade talents all possess innate physiques! While within the various innate physiques, the Flames Spirit Physique is considered the highest grade amongst fire attributed physiques!\u201dWhile listening, Huang Yue Li nodded along, but she still did not fully believe him.\u201cWhat you say, makes much sense. Unfortunately this physique\u2019s ability to perceive Profound Qi is\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because the cultivation method you are using is wrong!\u201d\u201cWhere are the errors?\u201d\u201dRolling his large grape-like eyes, the boy replied: \u201cHehe. This, you want to know right? On this large expanse of land, only this Little Lord knows! If you want to know, it all depends on your attitude. Unfortunately with your rough behaviour earlier, I\u2019m afraid that this Little Lord cannot seem to recall!\u201dHearing this, Huang Yue Li released her hands and gently lowered him to the ground.Too delighted, the small boy gleefully said: \u201cHumph, humph. Now you\u2019re willing to admit your wrongs? Too late for regrets? Ah? This Little Lord will tell you\u2026\u2026hey. What are you doing?\u201dAfter Huang Yue Li placed him down. She turned his body over and started to vigorously slap his buttocks.\u201cPa! Pa! Pa!\u201dClear, crisp sounds rang out.This caused the small boy to wail out: \u201cStinking woman! Female devil! Release me! You dare hit me? Then I will ever tell the cultivation method! You shall be a piece of trash forever!\u201dHuang Yue Li merely snickered: \u201cLittle brat, you think I do not know? I am already the Sky Phoenix Ring\u2019s owner, while you are merely the spirit of the Sky Phoenix Ring. With a single thought, I am able to silence you. You do not possess any bargaining rights!\u201d\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d\u201cWhat about it? Are you ready to obediently confess?\u201dLarge, steaming tears rolled, while his bum bum burned, the small boy thought for a while. Under the abusive power of this female devil, he could only choose to surrender.From a corner, he pulled out an old book and placed it in front of Huang Yue Li.Picking up the book, Huang Yue Li saw the three large words printed across the cover-Nine Phoenix Transformations.\u201cThis the God Realm\u2019s peak grade cultivation method for the fire system. It\u2019s the Phoenix God Race\u2019s secret method. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that you stepped into some dogsheet luck and picked up the Sky Phoenix Ring, you would definitely be unable to possess it! Your luck is simply too good!\u201dIn an extremely sour mood, the small boy sulked while he grumbled out loud.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

To be slandered as a dog/pig/chicken or lower is one the lowest and most impactful insult. So here, the phoenix is admitting her luck is very good. Unfortunately due his dislike towards her, he is insulting and cursing her good luck.)Huang Yue li chuckled out: \u201cI am very sorry. This older sister\u2019s luck has always been very good.\u201dPicking up the book, she started to casually flip through it. Skimming through it\u2019s contents, she discovered that it further explained the Flame Spirit Physique in detail.It mentioned that in order to stimulate their vessels, those who possessed special physiques needed to use medicinal herbs which corresponded to their respective element. They also needed to coordinate it with the godly grade\u300aNine Phoenix Transformations\u300b to cultivate. If they failed to do this, not only would they be unable to display any advantages in cultivation, they would also be like trash, unable to sense the world\u2019s Profound Qi.It was no wonder Bai Rou Li was always treated like trash.Slapping the small boy\u2019s head, Huang Yue Li smiled: \u201cIt was hard to imagine that this little thing would still have some usefulness. In the future, this sister will treat you a little bit better. Now, since there is nothing else to do here, I will go cultivate.\u201d\u201cHey, wait, wait! Wait, wait up!\u201dSeeing that Huang Yue Li was about to leave, the boy hurriedly jumped up and hugged her thigh tightly.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She asked sternly, her voice cold.Lifting his face up, the boy replied: \u201cYou can\u2019t leave alone. Take me out with you. It has been several hundred years, since I was stuck in this lousy piece of jade! This Little Lord is bored to death! I want to go out for some fresh air!\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201d Pretending to hesitate, Huang Yue Li continued, \u201cIf a child with an unknown origin was to suddenly appear, how am I supposed to explain it?\u201dThe boy quickly answered: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that! I can change back into my original appearance.\u201d He smiled and reassured her.The chubby, bun-faced child suddenly disappeared. With a golden flash of light, a palm-sized phoenix appeared in his place. Its baby feathers had yet to fully grow out, causing its overall appearance to be like a yellow fluff ball.Huang Yue Li stared blankly.The tiny phoenix chirped twice, and flapped its wings in a proud manner. It personally felt that it was quite cute.\u2018Females have always been interested in cute, young animals. Although this female devil was quite ruthless in her methods, but seeing her gaze, she must quite like my true appearance right?\u2019Cupping her hands, Huang Yue Li lifted up the tiny phoenix to examine it. She nearly drooled.\u201cThis meat is just too tender. If one were to make a chicken mushroom stew, the taste would not be bad.\u201dThe tiny phoenix immediately froze.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026En, making it into a crispy golden chicken would not be bad either?\u201d\u2018Big brother~, save me! This female devil is just too scary!\u2019Oh how he wished to return home!!\u2026\u2026With a thought, Huang Yue Li discovered that she was back in her own room, only to realise that daylight had broken through.Stretching out her stiff limbs, she accidentally touched something was was cold as ice.The Sky Phoenix Ring had reappeared as an ordinary-looking jade pendant, and laid beside her. On the other hand, the \u300aNine Phoenix Transformations\u300bhad reverted to an extremely, tattered and dilapidated book.The fluffy baby phoenix was perched on the Sky Phoenix Ring. After casting her a sidelong glance, he flapped his infant wings and flew to the windowsill and started amusing himself as he celebrated his new found freedom.She made to sure to hide the Sky Phoenix Ring securely within her clothes before flipping open the\u300aNine Phoenix Transformations\u300b. Carefully and diligently, she began to study it.Previously when she was flipping through the phoenix\u2019s cultivation book, she did not read it too closely. But after reading it thoroughly, she found out that to cultivate this technique was not something easily accomplished.This technique contained nine different transformations, while each of the nine transformations corresponded to each of the nine cultivation realms.The Flame Spirit Physique was the best physique to be cultivated with this technique. Unfortunately due to this physique\u2019s uniqueness and this technique\u2019s high grade, the the resources needed for each breakthrough were tremendous.Just enabling the Flame Spirit Physique to sense Profound Qi needed more than ten different types of herbs. While each of the required quantity was enormous.Furthermore, you needed the rare and high grade Flame Cloud Pearl as the base for the other herbs.The most important and pressing matter that she needed to be completed now, was to gather these herbs.Quickly copying down the list of ingredients, she headed out.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

All the medicinal herbs on her list were available here. It was just\u2026\u2026in regards to the price, it was equivalently heart wrenching.For example, a stalk of Purple Basil Grass was worth ten silvers, while one flower bud of the Fire Sunflower was eight silvers\u2026\u2026(Note: I have opted to use silvers instead of the liang/taels mentioned. Based on my previous experience, there shouldn\u2019t only be silver, but gold too. In case of this, writing just silver and gold makes it easier to understand for English speakers. 1 Liang = 50g)And - these were only prices for the lowest grade of herbs. If one wanted a higher grade of herbs, the prices multiplied by a few fold.Gritting her teeth and looking at the list given by the little phoenix, she needed at least one hundred of each. On top of the fact that they needed to all be high grade too. In all, if she wanted to obtain everything, she needed at least thirty thousand silvers.Rubbing her money pouch wryly, Huang Yue Li felt that the reality was cold and harsh.Before leaving, she had questioned the maid Cai Wei. Afterwards she was told how pitifully poor she really was.Ever since the disappearance of Bai Liu Feng, her second uncle Bai Liu Jing had used various \u201cexcuses\u201d to assume control over family finances.Bai Ruo Li did not possess a single cent. Previously she had relied on pawning various antiques in order to survive the days.The fifty silvers within her possession were only obtained yesterday after extorting Bai Ruo Yan. With them, she could only buy five stalks of Purple Basil Grass.However, she did not pin any hope in purchasing many herbs from a measly fifty silvers. She had already long planned it out; She was not the continent\u2019s number one Armament Refiner for nothing. Even though the current her was greatly weakened and could not absorb any Profound Qi, creating a few toys were beyond trifling. Through that, will she earn her money.But after one lap, she tragically discovered something.She wasn\u2019t just ordinarily poor, she was miserably poor!Turned out that even the lowest materials for refining exorbitantly priced! There was no way for the current her to afford it!In her eyes, an extremely crappy, rotten iron low grade furnace already cost eight hundred silvers. Not to be mention the other items. It was basically highway robbery.In actual fact, she didn\u2019t know that the Armament Profession was built upon money.The previous her, was born into a large family. Coupled with her genius innate talent, all kinds of precious materials were easily obtained. Naturally she couldn\u2019t put these low grade products within her viewscope. But in the Southern Yue Country, these low grade materials were luxury products that only royalty and aristocracy could afford.As Huang Yue Li was pondering the question of earning more money, a familiar voice sounded beside her.\u201cThis profound weapon, how much is it?\u201dTurning her head, she saw that it was Bai Ruo Yan behind her.This incidental meeting caused Huang Yue Lie to smile. Her luck seemed to be quite good. Just was she was thinking how she lacked money, someone came to deliver money to her.By then, Bai Ruo Yan had also noticed her, and her facial expression immediately turned hostile.\u201cBai Ruo Li! You cheap slut, why are you here??\u201dHuang Yue Li sneered and replied: \u201cDid you lose your mind? You even need to ask why? The sole purpose in coming to a store is to purchase merchandise.\u201dBai Ruo Yan sarcastically laughed too: \u201cOn what basis can you do that? Can you afford anything within Thousand Treasure Pavilion? You are so poor that you probably can\u2019t even afford a single stalk right?\u201dHuang Yue Li smiled: \u201cWhether or not I can afford it, does not seem to be related to you right? On the hand, I find it quite puzzling. Just yesterday\u2026\u2026\u2026someone was involved in such a scandal yet dare to go out today. They really do have skin thicker than the city walls!\u201dAt the mention of yesterday\u2019s events, Bai Ruo Yan couldn\u2019t help but want to kill her: \u201cYou still dare to appear in front of me! Yesterday\u2026\u2026yesterday\u2019s affairs were orchestrated by you right? You dare to fool me like that, I will whip you to death, you slut!\u201dAs she spoke, she pulled out her whip and lashed out.Huang Yue Li had long predicted this. Stepping out, she dodged the strike.Lashing out spitefully, Bai Ruo Yan couldn\u2019t even touch a even a single thread on Huang Yue Li\u2019s clothes.Her anger was aroused further. Just thinking back to yesterday\u2019s shame on the street when she was being ridiculed and pointed at. She was nearly kicked out too. All she wanted to do now, was to whip Huang Yue Li to death and relieve the hate and anger she harboured deep within her.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

On the contrary, she had startled quite a number of Thousand Treasure Pavilion\u2019s customers.Swiftly, the security of Thousand Treasure Pavilion came to stop them.\u201cMy two Misses, our Thousand Treasure Pavilion does not allow any fighting in here. If you are not here to buy things, then please leave!\u201dThe shadow boss of Thousand Treasure Pavilion was rumoured to be from the Royal family. So he had placed regulations whom no one dared to violate.Hearing the guards words, Bai Ruo Yan didn\u2019t dare to continue further and obediently stowed her whip away.\u201cSlut, I\u2019ll let you go this once! Just you wait!\u201dAs she declared this, she turned to the shopkeeper she was speaking to earlier. Pointing in Huang Yue Li\u2019s direction she said: \u201cShopkeeper Sun, with your Thousand Treasure Pavilion fame and high status, aren\u2019t your customers all those with status? This girl is a penniless beggar who cannot afford anything in the store. Her sole purpose is to stir up trouble. Hurry and drive her away!\u201dShopkeeper Sun recognised her, she truly was the Wu Wei Manor\u2019s Fourth Young Miss.Although Wu Wei Manor cannot be compared to when Bai Liu Feng was here, but they could still be considered one of South Yue Country\u2019s influential powers. Naturally the young misses of the Bai family could not be offended.Raising his head, he asked Huang Yue Li: \u201cThis Young Miss\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, Huang Yue Li already displayed a pitiful expression and said in a low voice: \u201cFourth sister, how could you say such words like those\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dAn expression of astonishment was seen on Shopkeeper Sun\u2019s face.Fourth Sister?Could it be that she was the rumored and sole daughter to Bai Liu Feng\u2019s? That beyond good-for-nothing Third Young Miss, Bai Ruo Yan?\u201cYou are actually the Bai Family\u2019s Third Young Miss?\u201d\u201cIt was long said that the young misses of the Bai Family were not harmonious. Presently, Wu Wei Manor also did not treat their niece well, could it be that was all true?\u201d\u201cCan it be false? Just now, didn\u2019t you see that Fourth Young Miss directly pulled out her whip to attack her own cousin. She really lack manners. Tsk tsk, the tea truly turns cold when one leaves. That year, it was because of Bai Lie Feng that the Wu Wei Manor rose to such a height. Now when he is missing, even is his daughter is bullied like that\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this Bai Fourth Young Miss born of a concubine? Yet possesses such a domineering attitude! She is basically relying on someone else to bully people!\u201d(Note: Children not born of the first/main wife would be considered lower class. And if they were to do something \u2018shameful\u2019 it was to be expected, because of their status.)\u201cIsn\u2019t it said that the Bai Family\u2019s Second Young Miss wanted to marry the Crown Prince? Coming from such a family, how is she qualified to become the Crown Prince\u2019s Imperial Concubine?\u201dListening to the murmuring of the crowd, Bai Ruo Yan become more and more red.\u2018Clearly that it was that slut who was the mastermind yesterday causing her to lose all her face. Even if she whipped her to death, it wouldn\u2019t clear her grievances. So how did it change to relying on others to bully her?\u2019Yet she could not explain. Those feelings\u2026\u2026\u2026Cautiously she looked at her before weakly speaking again.\u201cFourth Younger Sister, I know that you are angry over yesterday\u2019s affairs. But I really do not know how it became like that. I can explain to you. Actually it was like this\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou, shut your mouth!\u201dAs soon as Bai Ruo Yan heard her mention yesterday\u2019s affairs, she hurriedly interrupted her.A face full of grief, Huang Yue Li bit her lip: \u201cThen\u2026\u2026Fourth Sister, the money that you owe me\u2026\u2026\u2026when do you plan on repaying me.\u201dBai Ruo Yan gave a blank look: \u201cWhat money?\u201d\u201cYou forgot? Yesterday you wrote an IOU.\u201dTaking out a piece of paper, Huang Yue Li waved it around.Bai Ruo Yang recognised that sheet. When she was delirious and muddled-headed, Huang Yue Li was tricked her into signing it!With the passing of yesterday\u2019s events, the fact that she did not kill Huang Yue Li was already her good fortune.

She could not even catch a single hair.Unfortunately, as Huang Yue Li was dodging, she was also speaking in a grieving tone: \u201cFourth Miss, this here in clear black words reads your name right? What do you mean that you signed unwillingly? How could I, your older sister who cannot cultivate, force you to sign your name? How do I possess that ability?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.

How could the Third Young Miss force her? Isn\u2019t she speaking lies without even batting an eye?\u201d\u201cReally befitting of someone born of a concubine, doing such a scandalous thing in such an audacious manner. She is totally losing the face of Wu Wei Manor\u2019s! \u201dBai Ruo Yan nearly spit out a mouthful of blood!Yesterday, it was unknown as to what methods Huang Yue Li used. But the fact that she was not clear headed was the truth. What she said was all the whole truth, but why did no one believe her at all?Not only this, on the faces of everyone present were clear signs of loathing and despise while Huang Yue Li drew all the sympathy. Even the guards of Thousand Treasure Pavilion were standing in front of Huang Yue Li, protecting her.Poking her head out from behind the guards, Huang Yue Li shyly said: \u201cFourth Younger Sister, I know you hold a grave misunderstanding towards me. Yesterday\u2019s affairs, I really can explain them!\u201d\u201cWhat do you have to explain??\u201d\u201cPresently there are many people present, so I will honestly speak the truth and allow everyone to be the judge!

Yet now, Huang Yue Li wanted to narrate everything from start to finish out here?What was there to say? Was she going to say that she was running around naked in the the streets?Those people on the street that day were common people. Even if they did see her in her most humiliating moment, they couldn\u2019t tell who she was. Even if they did recognise her, they wouldn\u2019t dare to speak of it.But the customers of Thousand Treasure Pavilion were not the same.

Fourth Sister, since you do not want me to speak, then I will not continue speaking. We are all one family, is there a need for you to use your whip?\u201d\u201cHumph! Who is your family? Fortunately you still know how to be afraid.

Finishing, she threw out two words: \u201cNot enough!\u201dEyes practically popping out, Bai Ruo Yan asked: \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dBlinking her eyes innocently, Huang Yue Li replied: \u201cFourth Sister, this IOU clearly states that you owe me one thousand two hundred silvers.

With Bai Ruo Yan\u2019s second grade talent, as well being at the fourth level of the Profound Qi Realm and her young age, she was considered quite outstanding.If she was able to enter one the seven great martial school, regardless of her strength and status, they would both be elevated greatly.That was the reason why she wanted to obtain one thousand and two hundred silvers. She was hoping to find a suitable armament in Thousand Treasure Pavilion to increase her overall strength. So when the time comes, she would be able to reveal outstanding results.If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she desperately wanted to find one, she would not have left the house so early after her embarrassment.But who would have thought that before the silvers even had a chance to warm up in her pocket, she met this malicious star, Huang Yue Li!Would she really need to give the money to her?Bai Ruo Yan could feel her heart bleeding away!But, if news of her affair on the street were to be revealed and if Huang Yue Li were to find a witness, then her innocence and reputation will be all gone!Even if she did successfully pass the exam and enter the top ranking school, the Heavenly Body School, she would never be able to marry into an elite family!Huang Yue Li was presently, watching quite leisurely.After struggling for some time with a face like someone was slicing at her heart, Bai Ruo Yan finally took a large bag out.\u201cThis is one thousand two hundred silvers! We will exchange the money and the IOU at the same time!\u201dHuang Yue Li wasn\u2019t unreasonable. After obtaining her money in both hands, she straightforwardly took out the IOU and handed it over to Bai Ruo Yan.\u201cFourth Sister, you must be careful. Please be very cautious and ensure that no one obtains it to swindle money from you!\u201dChuckling, she gave the bag of money a good look, \u201cIt really is one thousand two hundred silvers. Its weight sure isn\u2019t light! Truly befitting of the Manor Master\u2019s daughter, so different from me his niece. One thousand two hundred ah, giving it out so easily. I will have to ask Fourth Sister to continue to take care of me in the future!\u201dUnder her barrage of taunts, Bai Ruo Yan was really at her limit. Eyes darkening, she narrowly avoided faintly on site.\u201cFourth Young Miss!\u201d The maid that accompanied her, hurriedly rushed up to support her.Bai Ruo Yan couldn\u2019t stay any longer. Flicking her sleeves in anger, she turned and promptly left.The surrounding crowd swiftly followed suite and scattered.In a day\u2019s time, the events of the Wu Wei Manor bullying the sole daughter of the missing elder brother, swiftly travelled throughout the entire capital. This resulted the reputation of the inhabitants of the Wu Wei Manor to sweep the floor, reaching rock bottom.After obtaining her one thousand two hundred silvers, Huang Yue Li began to purchase all necessary items she needed.This was the first time that Shopkeeper Sun saw the Third Young Miss ever come to Thousand Treasure Pavilion. Who knows what this good-for-nothing person wanted to buy.Afterall, the majority of Thousand Treasure Pavilion\u2019s merchandise were armaments and pills. These clearly were catered specifically for martial practitioners.Filled with curiosity, Shopkeeper Sun followed behind Huang Yue Li.\u201cThird Miss Bai, I please ask you what you want to purchase?\u201dCasually, Huang Yue Li pointed to the most ordinary armament furnace on the shelf.\u201cThat furnace, I will need your help to deliver it to the side courtyard at Wu Wei Manor.\u201dNormally, armament furnaces were the height of two people, and weigh more than several hundred jin. So naturally they provided delivery along with purchases.Shopkeeper was momentarily stunned: \u201cThis\u2026\u2026Young Miss Bai, do you know what this is used for?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it just a armament furnace?\u201d Huang Yue Li looked at him strangely.This was also one that was of a bad quality with an irrational composition which was likely to affect and spoil the end quality of the product.Shopkeeper Sun responded: \u201cThen what you do you want to buy this for? You should know that this armament furnace is something that Armament Refiners used to make armaments. If ordinary people where to buy, it would have no use whatsoever!\u201dYou can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But now it seemed that not only was she good-for-nothing, she was also a spendthrift home wrecker!An armament furnace was something that was very highly priced. Without even considering it, she took out money to buy it. It didn\u2019t even possess much exhibition value! If she could find no use for it, then wouldn\u2019t it be basically throwing money into the river?Eight hundred silvers. Even if you were to buy some ordinary rank pills, you could still buy a small bottle\u2019s worth.But, Shopkeeper Sun wouldn\u2019t hold any grievances towards money. Seeing how easily Huang Yue Li handed the money over, he hastily added: \u201cYes, yes, yes. Young Miss Bai please rest assured. Our Thousand Treasure Pavilion\u2019s delivery service is very fast, secure and reliable! Promising you that it will arrive around this afternoon!\u201dHuang Yue Li gave an \u201cen\u201d and walked to the next counter.Whilst the people around her all raised their eyebrows, placing the label of spendthrift home wrecker on her.Everyone all shared the same thoughts. They assumed that Huang Yue Li possessed too much money to spend, hence her reckless purchase towards that furnace. Not one person thought that she would actually use it.The reason being that the occupation that used this furnace was a very rare and very noble career in the Tian Ling Continent.Even if they were just a rank one Armament Refiner, they would still hold great power and authority in a small country like South Yue.It is obvious that profound qi elevated a martial practitioner\u2019s strength. Between two practitioners of the same level, if one possessed an armament that suited them, then would be able to crush their opponent. Doing whatever they pleased.Whilst there were also several requirements needed to become a refiner. You must simultaneously possess both fire and metal attributes, along with a strong spirit force. Lacking any one of these, you would not be able to become a refiner.Just possessing two attributes was already very rare, one in a hundred opportunity. Furthermore, you need both fire and metal, plus a strong spirit force. With those two demanding prerequisites, the chances of finding a person like that would be the same as getting struck by lightning.Additionally, with each rank promotion, there will be a great consumption of materials. If you do not have a powerful backer, then it would be almost impossible to improve and advance.Due this and the occupation\u2019s rarity, their status\u2019 naturally rose sharply. No matter where they go, they would be warmly welcomed.You must know, this Third Young Miss Bai was the nationally recognised trash, good-for-nothing. How could she possibly be an esteemed and noble Armament Refiner?Huang Yue Li didn\u2019t mind what others thought of her. Acting as if nothing happened, she walked to the section contain armament materials.This area was already browsed by her earlier, so she knew what she needed to buy.\u201cShopkeeper, I want a stalk of Xiao Xiang Bamboo, a piece of Ochre coloured Tin Stone, twenty pieces of North River Mica, three pieces of iron essence\u2026\u201d(Note: Hmmm, it seems that the author is using modern mineral names. I tried translating the names separately, but they turn out very weird sounding. Also ocher is a pale yellowish-brown colour.)Hearing how Huang Yue Li called out the names of these materials so familiarly, Shopkeeper Sun\u2019s were practically popping out of their sockets.These were all common materials for refining!Third Miss Bai bought both an armament furnace and materials!What did this mean?It would mean that she was preparing to refine something!You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Is refining armaments such an easy task? You do not possess fire and metal attributes, nor third grade or higher talent, or refining techniques. Wasting materials is just a little issue, but you could be burned by explosions. Even deaths have occurred before!\u201dHearing those words, Huang Yue Li was shocked.\u201cYou could even burn yourself from refining armaments?\u201dThe lower the grade the armaments were, the lower amount of spirit force needed. Thus there were even lower chances of actually getting burned.Under Huang Yue Li\u2019s analysis, the chance of being injured from refining a first rank armament was close to zero.But in Shopkeeper Sun\u2019s perspective, when he saw Huang Yue Li\u2019s attitude, he misinterpreted it as she did not believe him. Inwardly, he could only shake his head.These young masters and misses were so simple minded and innocent. Without any understanding, they would buy a furnace in the heat of a moment and act like learned scholars in an attempt to refine.Aren\u2019t they overestimating themselves too much?If armament refining was such a simple task, would Armament Refiners possess such grand status\u2019?Not only would them be unable to refine a proper tool, they might even end their life in the process!Shopkeeper Sun spoke up again: \u201cYoung Miss Bai, I am not trying to scare you. While there are chance of explosions while refining, there is also the possibility of releasing toxic gasses if you put the materials in the wrong sequence\u2026\u2026\u201dHuang Yue Li interrupted him there: \u201cShopkeeper, I know all of these things that you are saying. I will inconvenience you and ask you to wrap up all the materials that I just listed!\u201dSeeing her stubbornness, Shopkeeper Sun didn\u2019t bother to persuade her further. He swiftly beckoned an assistant to retrieve her desired materials.\u201cWait a moment!\u201d All of a sudden, Huang Yue Li called out.Both Shopkeeper Sun and the assistant turned around to look at her.Feeling the near empty purse of hers, she said with some regret: \u201cI don\u2019t have enough money. Give me the lowest grade materials\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dEveryone was thoroughly convinced.\u201cNo money? If you don\u2019t have enough money, why spend so much to buy that furnace? Must you try your hand at refining?\u201d\u201cThis weak and good-for-nothing girl who has never learned how to refine and is using such low grade materials. If she really were to successfully refine something, then ghosts would really exist!\u201d\u201cAi, don\u2019t talk about it. What can you do if her family has money. Her, headstrong? When she gets burned, that will be her time to cry!\u201dHuang Yue Li turned a blind eye to all present, and exchanged all of her money for low grade materials. Carrying various large and small packages, she left Thousand Treasure Pavilion.On the large street, it was bustling with people.A horse cart was conveniently parked outside Thousand Treasure Pavilion. Who knows how long it had parked there for.Huang Yue Li couldn\u2019t help but turn and look twice.This horse carriage was just too eye catching.The entire carriage was made from black gold sandalwood. A single cun (inch) would cost more than ten thousand silvers!Harnessed at the front were also eight, black horses. They were rank five demonic beasts, Flowing Cloud Colts. They were the favourite mounts of the six major martial cities. But now, they looked like ordinary horses whose use was to pull carts only.Others were only exclaiming about the carriage owner\u2019s extravagance. But Huang Yue Li was truly shocked.That was because she could see that this horse carriage was an extremely high grade armament. Furthermore, both offense and defense were integrated together, very powerful.Just by relying on this armament alone, you would be able to easily defeat a peak level Sky Profound Realm expert!The horse carriage owner\u2019s status was definitely extraordinary!You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She never cared much for rumors and gossip in the first place.Refining, earning money and cultivating were the things she actually cared about.With quick steps, she left the area.What she didn\u2019t notice was that the window of the carriage behind her was open. With the open window, it revealed the perfect shape of a male\u2019s face.Thin but distinct lips and skin like jade. On his face he wore a silver mask that was almost like a second layer of skin on his face.This clearly was the male who had a brief exchange with Huang Yue Li in the back courtyard yesterday!As he watched the thin and quickly receding back view of Huang Yue Li\u2019s, the male\u2019s line of sight seemed to be glued to her. So matter what, he could not take his eyes off her.This Third Young Miss of the Bai Family, yesterday should have been the first time they meet. But for some unknown reason, she gave him a very unusual but familiar feeling. Like every single motion of hers, her frowns, her smiles, her steps were already carved years ago into the depths of his heart.(Note: Mu Cheng Ying, is that you? Did you also reincarnate to chase your lady? Please let it be trruuuueeeeeeeeeeee. Author don\u2019t you dare flag a super duper hottie at the beginning only to break his heart and disappear forever!!!!!!)Today, he had arrived very early. Early enough to see the weak appearance of Huang Yue Li, her pitiful act and her trick playing around Bai Ruo Yan. The entire process of her swindling Bai Ruo Yan to pay her that large sum of money were seen by him.Everybody present thought Huang Yue Li to be a pitiful and innocent, good-for-nothing girl. Only he see differently, the girl was clearly disguised as a pig in order to eat the tiger. Playing everyone!Speaking of which, this was really strange!This girl clearly wasn\u2019t a beauty. If you were to talk about body, she had no body shape, and the face, there was nothing either.But what stunned people was her crafty smile. Once she obtained the money, she couldn\u2019t help but reveal how proud she was of herself. For no rhyme or reason, she attracted the entirety of his attention.This type of feeling\u2026he had never felt before.The two personal guards beside the male both exchanged a glance. They could both see the shock displayed within each other\u2019s eyes!God, this was the first time that they saw their strong and resolute Highness reveal such a warm gaze. Furthermore, it was towards a young girl who clearly hadn\u2019t developed well!The curve of those lips were much too clear. Could it be that their Highness did not realise?Is it possible that His Highness was moved by her?As soon as they thought how icy cold their Highness was to females, the fact that he could find a girl that he liked was a good thing.But, His Highness\u2019 standards were a bit\u2026\u2026isn\u2019t that a bit too unreliable?The Third Young Miss Bai was the infamously known good-for-nothing. While His Highness possessed heavenly talent, they were worlds apart. This girl is wholly unable to match him!Only when the huang Yue Li\u2019s figure disappeared around the corner did the male regain conscious again.He then beckoned to one of his guards, instructing him: \u201cGo investigate for me the purpose of Third Young Miss Bai\u2019s visit to Thousand Treasure Pavilion today. What did she purchase and for what reason?\u201dAccepting the order the imperial guard went to complete it.Shortly after, Shopkeeper Sun was escorted out. Standing infront of the horse carriage and shaking like a leaf in fear he gave his respects to the male.\u201cLo\u2026\u2026Lord, what you have asked is kept confidential for the customer. According to rules we are unable to reveal anything\u2026\u2026\u201dFrostily, the male swept his gaze down. With just a single gaze, he had caused Shopkeeper Sun legs to crumple, making him kneel on the ground.Head beaded with sweat, he didn\u2019t dare to hesitate any longer and hastily revealed everything: \u201cLord, please calm down. It\u2019s not like I cannot say it. What Third Miss Bai bought were all related to armament refining\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen the male heard him listing all kinds of materials, he couldn\u2019t help but become stunned. But shortly afterwards, the corners of his mouth rose.\u201cLooks like\u2026\u2026that little girl is preparing to begin refining. It\u2019s just unknown, what type of armament will she make?\u201dStroking his jaw, he leisurely said: \u201cThis shop, this Lord will buy it.\u201dYou can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What you may not know is, the owner is part of the royal household\u2026\u2026\u201dThe male did not respond. He gave a glance around and then proceeded to pick up the jade tea cup from the table and began to drink lightly.His fingers were slender but powerful and looked like jade. The mere action of him raising the tea cup possessed both a graceful and noble bearing, highly pleasing to the eye.The personal guard beside the horse carriage walked up to Shopkeeper Sun and cut off his sentence.\u201cIsn\u2019t the boss behind your shop just a Lord of Dong\u2019An? Just by his status alone, he wants to fight against our master? Hurry and inform your Lord of Dong\u2019An that our master\u2026\u2026wants to buy this store! Tactfully prepare the estate\u2019s title deed. Tomorrow our master will send someone one over to retrieve it.\u201dIn that moment, Shopkeeper Sun was at a loss for words.Lord Dong\u2019An, he was the Emperor\u2019s nephew with matchless identity. Yet the mysterious man in front of him didn\u2019t seem to put that identity in his eyes.Could it be that his own identity was something far above Lord Dong\u2019An\u2019s? He couldn\u2019t possible be one of the Emperor\u2019s Prince\u2019s?When he thought this far, Shopkeeper Sun\u2019s heart jumped. He couldn\u2019t possibly be the rumored\u2026\u2026But, it had been many years since that person last appeared!If it really was him who had returned, then it would be exceedingly serious\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026To what was happening behind her, Huang Yue Li was oblivious.The speed of Thousand Treasure Pavilion\u2019s delivery service really wasn\u2019t just empty words. By the time she arrived home, the two person tall furnace was already neatly placed within the study.Currently, the maid Cai Wei was circling the furnace with a face full of amazement.Seeing that Huang Yue Li had returned, she hurriedly walked to greet her.\u201cThird Young Miss, what did you go out to do? This armament smelting furnace, was it truly bought by you?\u201d\u201cCould this possibly be fake?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026this is something only Armaments Refiners can use?\u201dHuang Yue Li chuckled and said: \u201cYesterday when I went to the study, I found a book that my father had left behind. When I opened it, unexpectedly it was a personal letter from an Armament Refiner. There were also detailed explanations regarding refining and smelting. So I decided to try my hand at it.\u201dCai Wei Blankly listened, \u201cBut\u2026\u2026how could refining be this simple? Don\u2019t others say that Armament Refiners are like Gods, can stone really become gold? I think you must need extremely high talent in order to to succeed right?\u201d\u201cOf course I possess refining talent. My father had said in the letter that he had tested my potential when I was younger. That is why he wrote that letter and told me to train diligently, improving everyday!\u201dHuang Yue Li was blurting out nonsense non-stop.But Cai Wei wasn\u2019t experienced or knowledgable like Shopkeeper Sun. She was someone of ordinary birth, furthermore she was but a lowly servant. At most, the information she could obtain was from listening to others discuss how difficult the profession was. She was oblivious to the actual difficulty.Hearing Huang Yue Li speaking like that, she easily believed her.She happily replied: \u201cTurns out it was the Previous Master who said this, naturally this wouldn\u2019t be wrong! This\u2026this is really too good. Third Young Miss, if you really are able to become an Armament Master, the current master and his family would no longer dare to bully you!\u201dHuang Yue Li on the other hand meet with something unexpected.Looked like that cheap, old man Bai Liu Feng, of hers truly wasn\u2019t simple. Just through his good reputation alone, she was able to swindle others. Those years, he was definitely a highly influential man of the crown\u2019s\u2026\u2026Just how did he disappear?Suddenly thinking of something, she said: \u201cRight, I need you to complete a task for me. Go find a couple of beggars outside and ask them to spread the news of my Fourth Sister running around naked in the streets. The further the news spread, the better. The best result would be spreading it throughout the entire capital!\u201dYou can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That day, Fourth Young Miss must have definitely met with some mishap, resulting in her actions. If this fuss blows up in the capital, then how shameful it will be\u2026\u2026\u201dHuang Yue Li sneered: \u201cI precisely want her to be humiliated!\u201d\u201cBut, Third Young Miss, if Fourth Young Miss\u2019 chastity really were to be questioned. Then with your identity as a Young Miss in the Manor will also be affected\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t I already framed by others, saying I secret meetings with a man, already losing the family\u2019s face? What reputation am I afraid of ruining?\u201dHuang Yue Li became a bit impatient and she continued: \u201cEnough, looking from all angles, you do not seem like my maid at all! Go do as I say!\u201dSeeing that she was angered, Cai Wei went to do her bidding.Frowning her brows, Huang Yue Li guessed that her maid had been influenced by the previous Lord too much. Her courage was even smaller than a watermelon bug. How could this acceptable? She must find a suitable time to train up her courage!When Cai Wei left, she locked the doors to the study. She also set a simple trap to avoid others from entering.The small fluffy phoenix ball then flew out of her sleeves. Once it landed, it transformed into an arrogant faced child.Within its large, round, watery purple eyes were clear expressions of despise.\u201cGood! Female demon, you are too treacherous. Without shame! Just earlier this morning you received that stinking and strange aunty\u2019s silvers and now you rush to publicise her affairs! Do you still possess a human\u2019s conscience?\u201dHuang Yue Li did not possess the slightest bit of guilt.\u201cSo what if I took her silvers? That IOU was something she wrote herself. It is heaven\u2019s law to repay your debts. If she doesn\u2019t want me to spread it, did she pay any hush money?\u201dThe small phoenix replied: \u201cThen her IOU\u2026\u2026didn\u2019t you trick her into signing that? You already received a sum of money, yet you still want to receive hush money?\u201dHuang Yue Li icily replied: \u201cLittle brat, I\u2019ll warn you not to talk recklessly. What trickery? It was that girl who took the initiative to come here first to destroy my property. All I received was the appropriate psychological compensation. As for the matter of the hush money, that is a completely different matter altogether. Who told her to run around naked? An eye for an eye, each and every debt must be calculated clearly. I did not indiscriminately go asking for money!\u201dThe small phoenix was thoroughly stunned by her shameful calculations.This female demon was not only black on the outside, even her intestines were black!(Note: Saying that she wasn\u2019t just treacherous on the outside, but even her guts was filled with treachery.)One truly would feel pity for the Fourth Young Miss in offending this female demon. Even if she didn\u2019t die, she would at least shed a layer of skin!Just as he was blankly thinking, Huang Yue Li suddenly picked him up.Just as he wanted to struggle, he was swiftly released in an opening of the furnace.Her eyes curved in smiles, Huang Yue Li asked in an extremely gentle and warm tone: \u201cLittle brother, help big sister with something okay?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026what do you want to do?\u201dVery cautiously, he withdrew his body backwards.Just a moment ago, her face was filled with sinister calculations and in a blink of an eye, she was full of sweet smiles. The small phoenix didn\u2019t feel moved, on the contrary he could feel beads of cold sweat appearing.\u201cIt\u2019s very easy, just a little, little, little thing. You know that in order to refine armaments, the power and quality of the flame is very important. As a powerful and grand ancient mythological phoenix, your innate flame must also be equally formidable right? If you just breathe a small breath of fire, en, open your mouth to help, you will be assisting this big sister by a lot. Isn\u2019t it easy?\u201dHe furiously shook his head.\u201cNo can do! No can do! The Phoenix\u2019s true flame is something formed from our origins. I am still young, if I were to recklessly spit out flames, then it could drastically affect my future growth and development!\u201dYou can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You must be a honest child\u2026\u2026\u201d Purposefully Huang Yue Li said this.\u201cWho said I can\u2019t release fire!\u201dWhen he was questioned, the arrogant little phoenix immediately jumped up!\u2018You can insult this little lord, but you could not insult this little lord\u2019s race!\u2019Jumping up, he breathed in and let out a large breath of air.\u201cSwoosh\u201d it sounded out.A bright golden flash appeared. That stream of golden coloured flame lit up the entire study brightly!Huang Yue Li couldn\u2019t help herself but excitedly step forward.\u201cTrue Phoenix Flames! This is the legendary Phoenix True Flames!\u201dIn the top ten rankings of flames, the True Phoenix Flames were ranked first. It was also said that it was only the God Realm that possessed this type of heaven defying flame. With it, you were able to greatly increase the armament\u2019s grade and efficiency.This was a flame type that she never saw in her previous life. Yet today, she easily saw this flame enter her possession!Smiling joyfully, Huang Yue Li rubbed the phoenix\u2019s head, \u201cSo clever. Your performance today was very good. So tomorrow this older sister will add meat to your meal!\u201dLooking at her for a while, the little phoenix suddenly with a \u201cswish\u201d shrunk, changing back into its fluffy feather ball shape.Flabbergasted, Huang Yue Li stared at it.Looks like what the little brat said was true. Just blowing out that ball of fire was really taxing on it. It wouldn\u2019t really affect its growth?Feeling a bit guilty, she cupped the little phoenix in her hands and placed it on a soft surface.\u201cCreak\u2014\u2014!\u201dHeading tilting to the side, the little phoenix fell asleep.After rubbing its fluffy stomach briefly, Huang Yue Li returned to the furnace.In her previous life, she was a grand ninth rank Armament Refiner in the Tian Ling Continent. Her techniques in the refining had reached the pinnacle.But the current her didn\u2019t possess the slightest shred of profound qi or dual attributes in fire and metal. Not matter how high her skills, it would be hard to succeed.But now she possessed the True Phoenix Flames, making it an entirely different story altogether.Huang Yue Lie threw in all the materials she bought in the afternoon in one motion. Holding her breath in concentration, she then closed her eyes.As the golden coloured phoenix flames burned around the furnace, it cast a disk of light on her face.She sat there without moving for a long time before abruptly opening her eyes.In the next moment she sent a palm towards the fire, then another one and another one\u2026\u2026In a blink of an eye, she had already sent out more than a hundred palm strikes!The originally weak golden flames burst into a raging inferno. The materials instead the furnace also gradually began to merge together. At speed in which normal people could still see, they gradually molded into a distinct shape!If a true refiner were to stand by her side, they would most definitely by stunned by the sight.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only when the first item\u2019s impurities were eliminated, did they dare to add the second item. Just this process of eliminating impurities would take several hours.This was even more stressful in the forming of the weapon\u2019s actual shape. Each and every palm strike could incur a different reaction. If you were to make even the slightest error, all your previous effort would have gone to nought while also wasting all those materials.A more serious consequence would be an explosion.This was especially concerning for fires of such intensities and sizes like the one she was using. If this fire were to explode, then it could raze the surrounding area to the ground.Yet Huang Yue Li\u2019s current actions were the complete opposite of careful and cautious. She directly threw all her materials into the furnace in one go and afterwards, they condensed and solidified together.In the time it took burn half a stick of incense, Huang Yue Li snorted out and stopped her hand movements.The raging inferno gradually calmed and died down into a weak and small flame.Wiping the sweat from her forehead, she opened up the lid.Lying quietly at the bottom of the furnace lay three different armaments. These three were emitting a vibrant cyan glow. With a single glance, you were able to tell the immense energy contained within them.Taking out the armaments, Huang Yue Li gave them a look and let out a sigh.\u201cThird Rank Armament\u2026\u2026isn\u2019t this a little too trashy! As expected. Without any profound qi, my dreams of refining top quality armaments is a bit too far fetched\u2026looks like I need to quickly obtain those herbs to begin my cultivation. Otherwise I will not be able to refine higher quality armaments\u2026\u2026\u201dIf anyone else whereto be informed of her thoughts, they would spit out mouthfuls of blood on site.For an ordinary refiner, the success rate was only around ten percent. Not only did she succeed in one try, she also refined three armaments.Furthermore, these three armaments were all formed from low quality materials.This type of monstrous result was too hard to imagine. Against all expectations she was this displeased with this result!Putting the newly refined articles to the side, Huang Yue Li allowed herself to rest for a awhile and recovery her energy. Afterwards, she threw in another batch of materials and began refining again.Diligently without much rest, she refined the entire night. By the time the morning rays had started to creep out, her finished goods were littered in small mountains around her.Since she did not use pround qi to refine these, her consumption of physical strength was great. Without choice she was forced to return to her room. Falling onto her soft bed she immediately dozed off.Sleeping beside her, the little phoenix was startled awake by her movements. \u201cZhi \u201d he cried out as he awoke and flapped his wings. But very quickly, he returned to his world of dreams.It was like that one person and one pet slept all the way to the afternoon of the next day.\u2026\u2026\u201cBang! Bang! Bang!\u201dHuang Yue Li was awoken but a series of knocks at her door.Rubbing her eyes, she sleepily asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cThird Young Miss, not good! Second Young Miss has brought a group of people over. She is adamant on meeting you. I have no way to obstructing her\u2026\u2026\u201dIn a single and smooth motion, Huang Yue Li pulled the door open, asking: \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation?\u201dAnxiously Cai Wei informed: \u201cThird Young Miss, hurry up and find a place to hide! Second Young Miss has already heard the rumors spread yesterday, that\u2019s why she came here. It\u2019s probably to vent in the place of Fourth Young Miss\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was at that moment following a \u2018bang\u2019 sound, were the back courtyard\u2019s gates kicked opened roughly by someone.An old woman shouted out loudly: \u201cOpen up!

It saves me the trouble of going to find her myself.\u201dCai Wei urgently pressed: \u201cThird Young Miss, what time is it now to joke! Please take this chance to escape through the back door. This servant will use herself to buy you some time! Otherwise, when Second Young Miss arrives, she will definitely attack! Second Young Miss is the daughter of the first wife of this household\u2019s master. Additionally, she is also a great genius in regards to cultivation. If she were to hit you, there would be no one to defend you!\u201dHuang Yue Li\u2019s thin lips hooked up: \u201cHit me? What she seeks, I won\u2019t let her obtain it! Go, let us go meet this Second Elder Sister of mine. Let us see just how mighty this South Yue Country genius is!\u201d\u201cThird Young Miss!\u201dHuang Yue Li steadily walked out.On the other hand, Cai Wei was dashing and jumping to her in small steps. She was already worried beyond compare.What was wrong with Third Young miss? Ever since the day she was carried home, all the things she did were unconventional. Not even mentioning the matter of her generous pill giving, now she actually dared to go meet with Second Young Miss!Who didn\u2019t know that Bai Ruo Qi possessed fourth grade talent? She was only sixteen this year yet was already at the seventh level of the Qi Profound Realm. In the entire country of South Yue, you could count the amount of people who possessed this type of talent on one hand.It was because of her, did Bai Rou Li seem even trashier than normal.As for Bai Rou Qi, she didn\u2019t allow a single bullying opportunity to slip by. When she didn\u2019t have anything to do, she would come to give a her portion of frigid irony and scorching sarcasm. Grabbing at every chance to torment her miserably.Normally, Third Young Miss didn\u2019t have enough time to hide. While today, she took the initiative to seek her out? This time will be catastrophic. Who knows how wretched she will be after her torment!Burning with anxiety Cai Wei but was unable to do any preventative measures.The back courtyard\u2019s entrance doors were roughly smashed open by the old servant Bai Ruo Qi brought with her. With a high and mighty demeanor, she crossed over the and met with Bai Ruo Li face to face.\u201cBai Ruo Li! Seems like you really didn\u2019t die, you cheap slut!\u201dBai Ruo Qi\u2019s figure was outstanding, her five facial features displayed her feminine beauty. Her temperament was cold and arrogant. Adding these together and placing them with her fourth grade talent, she truly a \u201cIce Beauty\u201d and the goddess to many noblemen sons.It was only Bai Ruo Li who constantly constantly suffered her bullying knew of her true persona.Under that mask of cold arrogance lay a wicked, harsh, vicious and merciless heart!Huang Yue Li chuckled slightly: \u201cWho is the cheap slut cursing at?\u201d\u201cThe cheap slut is cursing you\u2026\u201dWatching the satisfied smile on Huang Yue Li\u2019s face, Bai Ruo Qi reacted and spat out: \u201cAfter hanging yourself, you mouth sure has become clever. No wonder Fourth Sister was swindled by you yesterday! Saying that it was some ghost. Clearly it was you cheap girl executing your dirty methods!\u201dA face full of innocence Huang Yue Li replied: Second Sister, I\u2019m afraid you are falsely accusing me! Yesterday when Fourth Sister came, she started shouting and running away. This gave me quite a fright and made me wonder if she had bumped into something?\u201d\u201cContinue acting! If it you weren\u2019t pretending to be a ghost to frighten her, how could she possibly run home so deranged looking? While also running on the streets\u2026\u2026bare! Losing the face of our Wu Wei Manor!\u201dWhen she recalled the scene of a large crowd huddled around the entrance of Wu Wei Manor pointing and talking, Bai Ruo Qi\u2019s face turned green.When this type of thing happened, not only did Bai Ruo Yan lose face, as her elder sister, her own chastity may be questioned!She still hoped to marry into the Royal Family. How could she allow herself to mingle obtain such a bad reputation?\u201cWhat am I pretending?\u201d Within Huang Yue Li\u2019s eyes she portrayed great innocence, if she needed more, she would display more innocence, \u201cFourth Sister is a grand fourth level Profound Qi Realm practitioner, what can I do to her?\u201dSuspiciously, Bai Ruo Qi thought for a bit.Her Third Sister was a piece of trash, who possessed as much courage as a mouse. How would she possess the ability to make Fourth Sister suffer such a loss? Could there some unknown point she was uninformed of?You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You unlucky person! I long said that you were bearer of bad luck. Making your father die wasn\u2019t enough, now you even want to strike out at your cousin! Why don\u2019t you do us a favour and die already?\u201dBlinking her eyes, Huang Yue Li replied: \u201cSecond Sister, look at what you\u2019re saying. Aren\u2019t you alive, living just fine? In the entire Manor, it is only you who frequents here the most. You have yet to die, so how am I able to curse others to their deaths?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your meaning?\u201d Taken back by her words, Bai Ruo Qi paused before reacting again, \u201cLittle slut, are cursing for my death?\u201dOn Huang Yue Li\u2019s face, she wore her sweetest smile.\u201cSecond Sister, how could speak like that? We are blood related cousins, while also being Young Miss\u2019 of Wu Wei Manor. If I am a little slut, then what would you be Second Sister? A big slut? Then what about Second Aunty? The universe\u2019s unequalled-super-ultra-awesome-big-slut?\u201dNever would Bai Ruo Qi think that the always yes-man and cowardly Third Sister would dare to utter such words today.Not only did she dare to provoke her, she also dragged in her own mother to scold. She was overturning the heavens!Red faced she retorted: \u201cGood, good! It looks like you truly are shameless. Not getting beaten for one day, you would forgot who and what you are? Today I will help you recall it. I will let you know that trash is trash, you will never be able to turn over a new leaf!\u201dAs she shouted this, Bai Ruo Qi advanced in large strides and threw out a slap towards Huang Yue Li\u2019s face.Face paling instantly, Cai Wei cried out: \u201cThird Young Miss!\u201dThe Second Young Miss was at the seventh level of the Profound Qi Realm. Within that slap were clear traces of profound qi that would definitely cause the receiver to spit out mouthfuls of blood.It was only the other day that Third Young Miss had been carried home. Her health had yet to fully recover, how could she possibly suffer that slap?She was fully devoted to protecting her master and really wanted to block that slap for her Third Young Miss. But that was a slap from a seventh level Profound Qi practitioner, most definitely was not her opponent. Before she could even react, Bai Ruo Qi\u2019s delicate jade hand had already arrived and was about to land on Huang Yue Li\u2019s face!In dismay, Cai Wei shut her eyes as she couldn\u2019t bear to watch what would happen afterwards.She only heard Huang Yue Li cry out an \u2018ah\u2019 sound.\u201cSave me! Please don\u2019t! Don\u2019t come over!\u201dFollowing it, a \u2018pa\u2019 sound crisply rang. Then suddenly a \u2018thump\u2019 sound, like a weight had been dropped onto the ground.Peeking her eyes open, Cai Wei saw a slender figure heavily land on the ground.Pu! A mouthful of bloody mist sprayed out into the immediate area in the back courtyard.\u201cThird Young Miss!!\u201dExtremely panicked, she jumped up. Uncontrollably, her tears rained down.That sound was very loud, and her fall wasn\u2019t light. It was unknown whether or not her Third Young Miss was alive or not. Her Young Miss is really living a harsh life!She was clearly borne of a high-social family, golden branches and jade leaves. Yet how did her father and mother die, whilst also being bullied from young? How did this happen?Kneeling on the ground, Cai Wei looked on intently, before her eyes turned blank.Her-her-her\u2026\u2026eyes didn\u2019t hallucinate right? That female who had fallen to ground and was struggling up\u2026\u2026why did it look like Second Young Miss?Rubbing her eyes, Cai Wei then looked again.Only hearing Huang Yue Li speak up from behind her: \u201cAh\u2026\u2026Second\u2026\u2026Second Sister, what happened to you? Are you alright? Why did you\u2026\u2026why did you suddenly\u2026\u2026suddenly fly up?

Although she wanted to stand up, she found that she was unable to move even a single finger!As she glared at the female infront of her, her eyes seemed to lack just that little bit more before it would start to shoot out fire.\u201cBai Ruo Li! What witchcraft did you use? Just why can\u2019t I move??\u201d\u201cSecond Sister, just how are you speaking? How come this little sister of yours, cannot understand what you are saying?\u201d On her face, Huang Yue Li displayed her incomprehension, \u201cYou cannot move, how is this related to me in any way? Just then\u2026\u2026wasn\u2019t it you who wanted to strike me? I was far too scared, so I was wholly unaware at what had happened. I only thought of hiding\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dClamping her teeth, Bai Ruo Qi sent Huang Yue Li a seething and poisonous glare.She truly felt that her Third Sister was playing tricks, but it was just as she said. It was her who had struck out first, while Huang Yue Li was too preoccupied in hiding, losing her head in fear. In the end, she held her head with both hands and squatted down.While Bai Quo Qi had ruthlessly kicked out. Internally she was thinking that even if this kick didn\u2019t kill this little slut, it should at least make her vomit blood.As a result, her kick really made the receiver go flying. Furthermore they as spit out blood as well, but the one who spat blood was her?How could that be? Wasn\u2019t that too cursed?At that moment, Huang Yue Li cried out like she had suddenly remembered something: \u201cAh! Second Sister, when you went flying earlier, your cry was very loud. Did you hurt or break any part of your body? No wonder you\u2019re not moving! Hurry and let me see!\u201dImmediately after speaking, she knelt down and starting feeling Bai Ruo Qi\u2019s back.Suddenly,Bai Ruo Qi felt pain coursing throughout her entire body, as if every single bone her body had shattered. She was in so much pain that she let out bloodcurdling screams of agony.\u201cAh! So painful! Ah, ah\u2014\u2014\u2014!\u201dBecause her cries were far too mournful, everyone felt cold sweat form on their bodies.Due to their exchange being far too fast, the old topknot maid Bai Ruo Qi bought could not react. She would never think that a young miss of the Bai Family would lose to that good-for-nothing, so she could not respond fast enough. It was only now that she regained herself.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026you what did you do to Second Young Miss?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t your guts too big? What trickery did you play? Hurry and cure Second Young Miss, or there you will regret it!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, not even thinking about what your status is? Just a piece of trash, yet dare to offend our Young Miss? Just wait for our Young Miss to teach you a lesson!\u201dHuang Yue Li chuckled out loud: \u201cAre you guys fools? You clearly know that if I cure her, she will teach me a lesson, then why should I cure her?\u201dShrieking in pain, Bai Ruo Qi spoke up: \u201cHurry! Hurry up and capture that little slut! Fiercely beat her up!\u201dThose servants were just waiting for those words as they leapt into action.But these servants were all normal citizens who did not cultivate, at most they would use a little bit more effort. In front of Huang Yue Li, they could not survive a single strike from her.Bang! Bang! Bang!It was merely a span of a few breaths, these maids were all knocked out (K.O.) and fell to the floor.Startled, Bai Ruo Qi\u2019s eye nearly fell out of their sockets. As things escalated to this degree, she saw that her Third Younger Sister was completely different from before!But was clear that her body didn\u2019t possess or emit any profound qi, so how could she\u2026\u2026beat down that many servants?Furthermore, she had used some unknown technique to seal up her points. She could not move at all.Bai Ruo Qi attempted all types of methods, like striking at her meridians directly, yet none of these methods worked.Huang Yue Li sashayed to her.

It was as if she was the one being bullied.There was nothing more infuriating than this!Bai Ruo Qi could feel another mouthful of blood rising up in her throat, nearly spilling out. Using all her will power, she forcefully swalled it back down. By then her face was both green and purple from anger.\u201cAiyo, oh my! Looks like Second Sister cannot hold on for long! Cai Wei, hurry up and support her!\u201d\u201cAh? Eh\u2026\u2026yes. Understood Third Young Miss.\u201dStanding to the side, Cai Wei was watching everything blankly, unable to react anymore.

So painful! Stop you lowly servant. Who allowed your dirty hands to touch me!\u201dPanic stricken, Cai Wei pulled her hands back to look at her own family\u2019s Young Miss.Slowly and steadily, Huang Yue Li said: \u201cSecond Sister, your current condition really doesn\u2019t look good. I hear that being plagued with demonic energy could also be contagious. Yesterday it was Fourth Younger Sister who suffered it, so it couldn\u2019t be her who you received it from? Cai Wei, hurry and help me treat it!\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Muddled, Cai Wei asked: \u201cDemonic energy? How to treat it? This servant does not know how?\u201dHuang Yue Li responded: \u201cThat is easy. Use all your strength to slap her face!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dSimultaneously, Cai Wei and Bai Ruo Qi exclaimed.Biting her teeth, Bai Ruo Qi bellowed out in rage: \u201cLittle slut, you dare! You dare make you serving girl slap me?\u201dHuang Yue Li chuckled: \u201cSecond Sister, what are you saying? This younger sister is doing all this for your own good. Falling sick with demonic energy is a very severe illness. What if your sickness worsens and makes you run around naked like Fourth Sister did? Since it is like that, you can\u2019t hold off treatment because you are afraid of losing face. If you are sick, you must hurry and cure it!\u201dAs she was speaking she turned towards Cai Wei.\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Do you really want to cause Second Sister to die? Delaying the treatment of the Manor\u2019s Young Miss, you can not afford the consequences right? Hurry up and slap her! And use all your strength! Only then will you be able to expel that demonic spirit from within her body!\u201dCai Wei still did not dare to execute her commands.What type of person Second Young Miss, she and Bai Ruo Li were much too clear. From when they were young to now, she had suffered many beatings from her. When she was recalling how just ruthless her ordinary beatings were, Cai Wei felt her legs soften.Huang Yue Lid didn\u2019t rush her either, but patiently watched and waited for her.After hesitating for quite some time, did Cai Wei gingerly raise her hand.\u201cPa!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dA slap fell onto Bai Ruo Qi\u2019s face.Because Cai Wei was very nervous, that slap wasn\u2019t really heavy. Yet Bai Ruo Qi was screaming out like a pig being slaughtered.Cai Wei looked down at the person she was deathly fearful of. Yet under her hands, she was losing her head over the pain, no longer possessing any of the arrogance or despotism the Manor\u2019s number one genius formerly possessed. From within, she felt refreshed and satisfied.Momentarily, she forget her previous fears. Raising her hand again, she began a round of slaps.\u201cPa! Pa! Pa! Pa!\u201d\u201cAh! You dare! How dare you! You cheap slave, who you gave you this courage! Bai Ruo Li, you must and will die!\u201dBai Ruo Qi was screeching and shrieking at the top of her lungs.That old serving woman who was knocked to the ground and watching on stupefied.The reason being Bai Ruo Qi\u2019s personal strength. She was a seventh level Profound Qi practitioner, while Cai Wei was merely a non-cultivating commoner. Even if she were to muster all her strength and energy, no matter what she did it should not even tickle Bai Ruo Qi.So just why was she screaming out so wretchedly?Could it be there really was demonic energy within her?You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Earlier when she had helped her, she used a technique to manipulate her acupuncture points.Not only would this immobilise her and prevent from using her profound qi to protect her, it also multiplied the pain she experienced by ten thousand times.As a result, the pain Bai Ruo Qi felt from even a simple touch was equivalent to the pain she would feel if someone was slicing her flesh. What\u2019s more, Cai Wei was vigorously slapping at her face?Very quickly, Bai Ruo Qi was slapped swollen and it was impossible to see any facial expressions. The only method in which you could sense any emotion from her were through her originally peerless pair of beautiful eyes, in which they contained pure despise.She had never felt this wronged before. Never had she experienced humiliation on such a level!In all these years, it was always her who ordered people to press Bai Ruo Li to the ground executing those slaps from above, whipping her and using hundreds of different methods to torture her.She always felt that Bai Ruo Li deserved it.Who told her to be a piece of trash yet possess the title of the sole daughter of Wu Wei Manor\u2019s true master. While she was a super genius, yet had to be below her?Moreover, it was said when Bai Liu Feng had died, he had left many cultivation resources for Bai Ruo Li. But after all these years of interrogation, Bai Ruo Li had not handed them over!Bai Ruo Li this trash, what use she have by holding onto these cultivation resources. Only her, a talented person could use those resources. By not taking the initiative to hand these resources over was too untactful, just asking for a beating!More than ten years, she had always been like this.Who knew that on this day, everything changed.Bai Ruo Qi, one of South Yue\u2019s geniuses who you could count on your fingers, was trampled underfoot by her useless Third Younger Sister and firmly slapped on the face.If you spoke nicely, then Huang Yue Li was disinclined to do it herself and asked a serving girl called Cai Wei to humiliate her.While the old woman maid that Bai RUo Qi had brought over was still blankly lying on the ground. She didn\u2019t even know to protect her mistress!Was her brain flooded with water? Did she really believe that little slut\u2019s words, that she really was plagued with some demonic energy? It was very simple to see that, that little slut used some underhanded methods! Why did no one believe her!Her facing was burning with heat and pain, the blood within her stomach churning. Until she finally couldn\u2019t resist any more and spat out the blood. Eyes rolling back, she fainted on the floor!Because Cai Wei couldn\u2019t dodge in time, she clothes were covered with blood.Only then did she wake from her trance, indulging in the bliss of oppressing others and halted her hands.Walking over, Huang Yue Li looked and nodded: \u201cEn, this seems about enough.\u201dFinally at the moment, that old maid regain her sense of self.Bai Ruo Qi\u2019s wet nurse, Mama Han struggled to pick herself up from the ground. Throwing herself to Bai Ruo Qi\u2019s side, she began to wail out loudly: \u201cSecond Young Miss! Second Young Miss what is wrong with you? Hurry and wake up! Third Young Miss, you are too cruel. You actually made Second Young Miss faint from those strikes! Also Cai Wei, you cheap girl cannot be forgiven either. Just you wait. Once the Lord knows, he won\u2019t forgive you! Wait for the day you will be sold to the brothel!\u201dWidening her eyes, Huan Yue Li\u2019s eyes displayed a hurtful expression. \u201cMama Han, how can you speak about me like this? Look at me this good-for-nothing, how could I possibly make Second Young miss faint from mere beatings? The reason why she fainted was because she had being plagued by demonic energy earlier. It wasn\u2019t easy to cure her, so she merely overdrafted her energy in the process.\u201dAs she spoke, she walked over and pulled on Cai Wei\u2019s hands, pointing to her body.\u201cDo you see the blood on Cai Wei\u2019s clothes? With the red blood, there are traces of black. That is the demonic substance within her body being expelled out!

But Huang Yue Li spoke with such confidence and certainty that she found it hard to refute her.This entire affair today was too cursed.Even now she could not truly make any proper sense of anything.How did Second Young Miss suddenly fall to the ground? It couldn\u2019t be that she was defeated by the Third Young Miss?Additionally, the Third Young Miss\u2019 courage was usually as big as a mosquito.

Second Young Miss is this sick, we must quickly sent her back!\u201dThese maids were long scared and lost all courage. Hastily they tripped and stumbled up and picked up Bai Ruo Qi, escaping to the door.They all thought that the female demon behind tem was too scary.

Furthermore, the courtyard had become this messy with bits of blood spattered here and there. Are they not going to pay some repair fees? This moral character\u2026\u2026you practically cannot bear to witness anymore!\u201dTripping over his little feet, the small phoenix narrowly avoided falling off her shoulder and onto the ground.This female demon was just too\u2026demanding money no matter what!Frightening.

Secondly, it would give Cai Wei a chance to toughen up and become more daring.And finally, this was the most important point. Cai Wei would have thoroughly offended Bai Ruo Qi.

Additionally, there was a limit to Cai Wei\u2019s talents, so a black level technique was the most suitable for her to use.Even so, Cai Wei was moved to tears and immediately knelt down infront of Huang Yue Li. (Pentakill)\u201cThird Young Miss, you treat this servant so well. This one never would have thought she would be able to cultivate, truly a thing I wouldn\u2019t dare to dream about. In the future, this servant will definitely serve on you with all my heart. Climbing a mountain of knives, through a sea of fire, I will not hesitate to do them!\u201dHuang Yue Li smiled: \u201cRemember your words. That\u2019s right, I have a task for you to complete right now.\u201d\u201cThird Young Miss please command.\u201dCompared to her usual attitude, Cai Wei\u2019s reverence and respect was increased by several folds.Huang Yue Li said: \u201cThis courtyard only has one maid and two old sweeping ladies. This is a bit too appalling. Later go to the slave dealer and choose a couple of reliable girls and some guards to properly tidy up this area. In the future, you will be the head maid of this back courtyard.\u201dIf there were some guards standing at the entrance, then at least, Bai Ruo Qi would not have escaped that quickly.With great difficulty she had taught her a lesson. It was time to raise the prices!What a shame, what a shame! It ached too much!\u201cAh? In order to buy some good maids nowadays, you need quite a bit of money\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore she could even finish her words, Huang Yue Li took out a large bag of silvers.Stunned, Cai Wei stuttered: \u201cThese silvers\u2026\u2026\u201d (Ace)By a rough estimate, there was about fifty silvers, but this household was on the brink of bankruptcy. Soon, they would not be able to afford food, yet Third Young Miss had just revealed a bag of silvers.Chuckling, Huang Yue Li answered: \u201cHurry and go.\u201dShe wouldn\u2019t tell Cai Wei this bag of silvers was taken off Bai Ruo Qi\u2019s body a moment ago.She had coming knocking in her territory, how would Huang Yue Li allow her to leave without relinquishing some items behind?Because of Bai Ruo Qi, wasting the entire evening, it wasn\u2019t until the next day that Huang Yue Li left her home.\u2026\u2026At the entrance of Thousand Treasure Pavilion, an endless stream of carriages and pedestrians flowed.Head raised, Huang Yue Li walked towards the entrance sign.She was fully aware that what she was doing would be similar to treasuring a jade ring that turns into a crime. So she darkened her entire face and wore a dark grey cloak as she proceeded to sell her armaments.A fist-sized golden-red ball appeared from within her cloak. Tilting its head, the fluffball observed its surroundings before burrowing out of the cloak. Flapping its tiny wings, he landed on Huang Yue Li\u2019s shoulder.\u201cCheep cheep\u2014\u2014!\u201dIn a hushed voiced, the little phoenix called out.As the master of the Sky Phoenix Ring, Huang Yue Li and the phoenix had been spiritually connected. Through their telepathic connection, she swiftly understood the little phoenix\u2019s words.This little brat was complaining that its stomach was hungry. It wanted to eat breakfast!Her eyes popping out slightly, Huang Yue Li glared at him: \u201cDidn\u2019t I just feed you a meat bun? It was you who refused to eat it, and now you\u2019re complaining that you are hungry? Aren\u2019t you playing with me?\u201dYou can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As she tried to feed him, he gave her a loathing gaze before diving unsteadily into her cloak.\u201cCheep! Cheep! Cheep! Cheep! Cheep!\u201dFurious, the little phoenix slapped one of its wings.What was those trashy things? It a noble and respectful ancient beast. How could it possibly eat something was made from unknown sewer oil or meat from some random corpse?Yesterday when it had spit out that ball of fire, he had exhausted quite a bit of energy. She had agreed to let him eat meat, but how could she take something like to pass him off!Eyebrows arched, Huang Yue Li asked him: \u201cMeat buns do not have meat? Being so picky at such a young age will stunt your growth. You tell me, if you can\u2019t put a meat bun in your eyes, what do you want to eat? \u201dArrogantly raising his head, the little phoenix proclaimed: \u201cCheep! Cheep!\u201d\u2018Just a few fifth level Gale Birds stewed in soup as well some seventh level spirit attributed herbs. Don\u2019t be stingy with the soy sauce as you simmer and fry them!\u2019Her hands grabbing his neck, Huang Yue Li lifted him up and maliciously smiled: \u201cFifth level demonic beasts, seventh level herbs. Your wishes are quite extravagant aren\u2019t they? I think it would be better for me to turn you into chicken soup for tonight. This way, I won\u2019t have to waste food on you!\u201d\u201cCheep!!\u201dThe feathers on the little phoenix\u2019s body all stood up.F***, this woman was too scary! She\u2026how dare she treat such a respectable and noble race like this?? She dared to compare him to a chicken, whilst also\u2026\u2026also considered eating him??Huang Yue Li continued: \u201cWhat? This elder sister can\u2019t even afford her own meals now, yet you hope to eat demonic beasts? Let\u2019s talk about it when we earn money. Otherwise I will just sell you for money!\u201dSpeaking to this point, she squatted down and her eyes brightened. Eye glittering, she looked at the little phoenix.Cold sweat formed on the pitiful little phoenix instantly.That sinister gaze he was far too familiar with. Once this female devil revealed this type of expression, it showed she was up to no good, ah? She she she\u2026\u2026\u2026what did she want to do?\u201cHehe. Today is the first day that I am coming out to do business, definitely must be auspicious. I can see that your body feathers are a full golden colour and quite festive looking. So\u2026\u2026I will call you Zuo Wang Cai!\u201d\u201cCheep! Cheep! Cheep! Cheep! Cheep! Cheep!!!!!!!\u201d\u2018What? What are you going to call this Little Lord? This Little Lord has a name! I don\u2019t want to be called some Wang Cai?? That name is what the dogs will use!\u2019It\u2019s just a shame, he just was the size of a small ball, unable to resist at all. Huang Yue Li was still beaming happily: \u201cRepeating Wang Cai six times, smoothly succeeding. The number six is a good number, as expected it is auspicious. Continue repeating it, bring more prosperity for this elder sister.\u201dThe little phoenix was so angered that the feathers on his head were standing up straight. Determined to not say it any more.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You\u2019re not repeating it anymore? Could it be that you really didn\u2019t develop well?\u201dFeeling emotional, Huang Yue Li shook her head and tucked him back into her sleeve. With big strides, she walked towards Thousand Treasure Pavilion.\u2026\u2026Thousand Treasure Pavilion.Inside the VIP area, Shopkeeper Sun was currently serving an esteemed customer.\u201cMaster Yan, you have graced our Thousand Treasure Pavilion with your presence in this humble store! Please sit down and please drink some tea!\u201dAn old man with a face full of arrogance sat down without any hint of politeness. He didn\u2019t even give Shopkeeper Sun a single glance.But Shopkeeper Sun was not angered in the least and personally poured tea for him. Fawning on him, he spoke up: \u201cMaster Yan, may I ask the purpose of your visit, to buy materials perhaps? Or\u2026\u2026 \u201dOnly then did Master Yan speak: \u201cThe purpose of this senior\u2019s visit is for an armament.

Extremely precious and very few were taken out to be sold!This was especially true with this Grandmaster Yan. He was the Vice-President of South Yue\u2019s Armament Association whilst also being one of three Third Tier Armament Masters!The armaments that he refined had a large possibility to be third level products!Cautiously and carefully, Shopkeeper Sun said: \u201cGrandmaster Yan, may I ask if you have brought the armament with you today? Would it be possible for this one to lay his eye on it?\u201dGrandmaster Yan nodded his head slightly.Very quickly a long sword lying within a sandalwood box was carried in.The body of the blade was emitting a weak cyan glow. With a quick look, you could tell it possessed of the might of a godly soldier!Grandmaster Yan said: \u201cThis cyan bodied sword is a third level lower grade armament. It is able to amplify a practitioner\u2019s offensive capabilities by about twofold.\u201dTurns out it was a third level armament! Amplifying one\u2019s offensive abilities and by two folds at that!Face lighting up with delight, Shopkeeper Sun had already begun to calculate. He must organise a large scale auction to sell this high level product!Every time a third level armament appeared in an auction, it would stir up the entire country of South Yue.Successfully completing this big business would definitely leave a good impression to the new owner!\u201cGrandmaster Yan, your product\u2019s quality is simplify too grand and brilliant! The entire South Yue, only you can refine an amplifying armament\u2026\u2026\u201dStroking his beard, Grandmaster Yan was quite pleased to hear this.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t considering our old friendship, this senior would have not come to your place to sell it. Selling the armament is possible at your place, but the profits must be split nine-one. I receive nine and you receive one\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, yes, yes. Please rest assured, this is how it should be\u2026\u2026\u201dWith Grandmaster Yan\u2019s noble status of a Third Tier Armament Master, even if the Emperor was in their presence, he wouldn\u2019t dare to disrespect him in the slightest. Nothing to say about Shopkeeper Sun. The fact that he was willing to cooperate with him, was already showing Shopkeeper Sun great favour!Any unreasonable request or condition, he would agree without complaint.It was at that moment that one of the store\u2019s staff came scurrying along knocking on the door.Displeased, Shopkeeper Sun answered: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Didn\u2019t I say it already? I am currently receiving an important customer, so do not carelessly come and disturb us!\u201dNervously, the staff carefully reported: \u201cYes, this one knows.

What jokes are you making?\u201dStanding up suddenly, he had knocked over the small table in the process.\u2026\u2026By the time Shopkeeper Sun and Grandmaster Yan had rushed back to the main hall of the shop, Huang Yue Li had already been kept waiting for quite a while.Clothed in a large cloak, she disguised herself as a youngster.Shopkeeper did not recognise her, but once he saw that her age was someone who had yet to reach twenty years, he began to frown.Grandmaster Yan was even more unrestrained and impolitely said: \u201cI say Old Sun ah. Your Thousand Treasure Pavilion is becoming more and more outrageous. This child who still stinks of his mother\u2019s milk dares to come swindle you in broad daylight!\u201dCasting him a glance, her gazed travelled from his old, wrinkled face of displeasure to the occupational badge on his chest.Third Tier Armament Master\u2026\u2026Third Tier, this was considered quite a high level master in South Yue. Not wonder his tone was this arrogant.Too lazy to respond to him, Huang Yue Li directly addressed Shopkeeper Sun: \u201cWhat? Shopkeeper Sun, even you think I am here to swindle some money?

This young master, don\u2019t be so hasty.\u201dHastily, Shopkeeper Sun went to block his path.He was someone who held open doors towards business. Unlike Grandmaster Yan who was subjective.He had concluded that though the chances of this youngster possessing third level armaments were very low, let alone a whole cartful. But since he dared to come to Thousand Treasure Pavilion, he should at least have some sort of treasure within his grasp.Even if he assumed it to be a second level armament, it was something he could not miss.With a pleasant tone and smile he said: \u201cThis young master, why don\u2019t you take the armament that you brought with you out and let us see it. The person beside me is the Armament Association\u2019s Vice-President. He is a grand Third Tier Armament Master. If your armaments can be appraised by him, they will definitely be able to fetch a high price.\u201d\u201cThird Tier Armament Master!\u201d\u201cTurns out he was the Armament Association\u2019s Vice-President!\u201d\u201cMy god! He is a such a famous person!\u201dHearing that, the customers within the store all started to exclaim in surprise.On Grandmaster Yan\u2019s face was an expression of content. It was clear that he was a person who enjoyed the worship of others.Casting Huang Yue Li a side glance, he said: \u201cOld Sun, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m not helping you, but it is just this brat is shooting his mouth so ridiculously. It\u2019s unknown where he found those rubbish armaments. Yet he is randomly calling them third level items. Completely unaware of the heaven\u2019s height and the earth\u2019s depths! Does he think that armaments are like cabbages? These actions are insulting us Armament Masters! This senior will absolutely not help appraise them!\u201dHurriedly Shopkeeper Sun consoled: \u201cGrandmaster Yan, please don\u2019t bicker and bother with the younger generation.\u201dAs he spoke, he used his eyes to signal Huang Yue Li to apologise to Grandmaster Yan.Ignoring this old man, Huang Yue Li took out a piece of paper she had prepared beforehand and handed it to Shopkeeper Sun.\u201cShopkeeper Sun, this is a rough summary of all the items. Because there are far too many items, it is inconvenient for me to bring them all in. I have placed them in a cart outside.\u201dAs Shopkeeper Sun scanned through the list, his gaze immediately turned blank. It was if he was a statue carved out of stone, not moving at all. \u201cThis\u2026\u2026this\u2026\u2026\u2026this is\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dNever before had Grandmaster Yan been ignored like so. Just as he was thinking how he wanted to slap that little demon to death, he saw Shopkeeper Sun face form an expression akin to seeing a ghost.Surprised, he asked: \u201cWhat is the matter? Is it really a pile of junk? This type of boastful youngster, this senior had seen too many!\u201dTaking the paper from Shopkeeper Sun\u2019s hands, he gave it a look.

What jokes are you making?\u201dArmaments were divided into Profound Weapon, Profound Armor and Profound Jewel. These three categories.r, like armor, but since this is a general term so please bear with this.)Within them, the Profound Weapon armaments contained the most attack power, the easiest to refine and the lowest in prices. The defensive Profound Armors were second.While Profound Jewels were armaments that held special abilities. They would commonly possess unique attributes and each one would be unique. They were the most precious.Additionally, not all Armament Masters are able to refine Profound Jewel Armaments.Even though Grandmaster Yan was an esteemed Third Level Armament Master, he was only able to refine Second Level Lower Grade Profound Jewels.However, there was something even more shocking on this list.\u201c\u2026\u2026At the end, there is even an entire set of defensive Profound Armors. This included a helmet, suit, wristguards, boots\u2026\u2026\u2026a total of thirteen items. The entire set could amplify one\u2019s defensive abilities by threefold and included a unique skill?\u201dAfter reading this list, Grandmaster Yan was so astounded that his beard was trembling.But very quickly, the corners of his mouth rose, revealing a contemptful smile.\u201cLittle demon, your knowledge towards armaments isn\u2019t shallow, even knowing what an armament set is.

You say that it is impossible for me to possess an entire cartful of armaments. Is it not because you have never seen so many Third Level Armaments before? Your experience scope is this low and you have the nerve to call yourself a \u2018respected\u2019 Armament Master?

This type of knowledge, you did you not go ask around before creating these lies? Blurting your mouth just like this?\u201dOnly high levelled masters could use and integrate different materials to form the different components of a Profound Armor into a complete set. Once the set was finished and put together, it would be able to boost the overall defensive power of the armor itself. It could even have an additional skillThird Level Armor\u2026\u2026this was something unprecedented.Chuckling, Huang Yue Li said: \u201cYou are certain?\u201d\u201cThis one is absolutely certain!\u201d\u201cThen if I were to really take out a complete set of Third Level Profound Armor, then what will you do?\u201d\u201cHumph, such a fantasy story!

You are this old but only a Third Tier Master. Your aptitudes are too low. I will not take someone with such a low aptitude as a disciple! If I were to win, then the regardless of my requests, the Armament Association will provided me with all the necessary materials I need for refining!\u201dMaster Yan was in disbelief. He did not think there would be any who would look down on a Third Tier Armament Master. This was too strange.\u201cGood, good! This senior wants to see what abilities you have. If you are able to take out all the items listed within this list, then you will become the Armament Association\u2019s VIP, able to use whatever resources available!

And two, she deliberately wanted to anger him.She didn\u2019t think that she would easily stir up his temper, making him take the bait!Thousand Treasure Pavilion really was a good place. Yesterday, someone was here to give her money and today someone was here to deliver her materials.Really is a hotspot of good Feng Shui.At this time, not even a crow or peacock could make a sound in Thousand Treasure Pavilion.No one dared to believe their eyes. There was someone who was daring enough to talk to Grandmaster Yan in such manner.Did he eat a bear\u2019s heart and a leopard\u2019s courage?Did he not think of the possible consequences from offending the Armament Association?Turning her head, Huang Yue Li addressed Shopkeeper Sun: \u201cShopkeeper Sun, to prevent against this old man from denying his debt, I would ask of you to be the witness!\u201d\u201cAh? Wit\u2026\u2026witness?\u201dOpen mouthed and tongue-tied, a drop of cold sweat ran down Shopkeeper Sun\u2019s head.\u201cHow would this senior deny a debt!

You could provoke anymore, but you went to provoke this female devil. Your age is already this old, yet you have to be played like this. This time, your face will be lost all the way back to your grandmother\u2019s home!\u2019The latter part is unprotected!Tragic! Tragic!! Tragic!!!Pushing his tiny head back inside, Huang Yue Li followed them with slow and steady steps.At the entrance of Thousand Treasure Pavilion, the chests that Huang Yue Li had brought with her, were already placed on the ground.Originally, these items could have been stored within the Sky Phoenix Ring, as the space was not small. But a spatial armament was considered a very uncommonly seen high levelled armament. She didn\u2019t want to arouse too much attention, so Huang Yue Li decided to hire a horse carriage to deliver these armaments.Eighteen chests, chained and locked were neatly lined up, very eye catching.\u201cWah, there are this many chests! Inside them\u2026\u2026it couldn\u2019t truly be filled with Third Level Armaments?\u201d\u201cWhat jokes are you making? All of them, Third Level Armaments? How much would they be worth? Unless this youngster stole them from the Royal Family\u2019s treasury, there is no way he would possess this much!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. By my estimations, if there are at least two chests filled with armaments is already pretty good. As for the rest, they should be just ordinary antiques and the like, to be sold at Thousand Treasure Pavilion for some silvers?\u201dNumerous curious pedestrians also stopped in their tracks to watch the scene. They were curious to what Thousand Treasure Pavilion was up to.Stopping in his tracks, Grandmaster Yan folded his arms and snorted condescendingly: \u201cBoy, hurry up and open the chests! Let this senior experience something and open up his eyes!\u201dLips curling, Huang Yue Li didn\u2019t go up immediately. On the contrary, he turned to Shopkeeper Sun and said: \u201cShopkeeper Sun, I ask that you place some of your most powerful guards around to protect the area. If this many Third Level Armaments were taken out, I\u2019m afraid there will people wanting to fight for them\u2026\u2026\u201dShopkeeper Sun was somewhat floored.Ordering some more people to guard? Afraid of people fighting over it?These words\u2026\u2026it was like she really did possess that many armaments!Sweeping his gaze at her, Grandmaster Yan spoke up: \u201cLittle demon, don\u2019t stall for time. Relax, as long as I am present, no one will dare to snatch your things away! Those who dared to stretch out their wings, will not be escape out of South Yue! Hurry up and open them!\u201d\u201cOkay. Since Vice-President Yan has spoken, I think it is believable. \u201dOnly then did Huang Yue Li walk out, pulling out a key. Slotting it into the first chest\u2019s lock, it smoothly opened.\u201cOld man, look well. Is it you who is shortsighted or me who is swindling others!\u201dHer white hands lifting up, the chest\u2019s contents were revealed.In the view of everyone, a cold beam of light shone out.Coming up close, you could see that a sparkling long sword was lying within the chest.The light emitting from the sword was like the autumn river, full of brilliance and life.\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026this is a Third Level Upper Grade Profound Weapon-Autumn Water Sword!\u201d Grandmaster Yan loudly exclaimed!\u201cOld Man, you actually know your products!\u201d Huang Yue Li sneered at him.\u201cThis senior has actually read the Ninth Tier Armament Master Grandmaster Huang\u2019s Profound Weapon Illustrations. Inside, this type of weapon was mentioned!\u201dOnce Grandmaster Yan saw the Autumn Water Sword, his eye seemed to brighten greatly. Stepping forward, he rushed to the chest and wanted to take the sword out to see.Unpredictably, his hands could not even touch the sword.\u201cPa\u201d.

Once he started researching, he would forget to eat and sleep for days.In his eyes, there was nothing that captured his interest more than a peak grade armament.When his eyes landed on that Third Level Upper Grade, Autumn Water Sword but was refused close examination, his felt as if his heart was being clawed into hundreds of pieces. Stifled with anxiety also in the mix.Shaking her head, Huang Yue Li shook her head: \u201cWhat is the rush? There are still so many chests to be opened! What if the other chests contain trash? Wouldn\u2019t your apology be in vain Grandmaster Yan?\u201d\u201cAiyo. Don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. Even if that is the only armament, then this senior has still lost, okay? This Autumn Water Sword is something only Grandmaster Huang herself could produce. Do you know how precious this is? Hurry up and let me see it!\u201dAs he said this, Grandmaster Yan was already preparing to open the chest.Huang Yue Li stretched out her arm to block his path. \u201cDo nott rush. Let us first view all the other armaments in the remaining chests. What I value the most is being fair and honest, for I am an upstanding person. I definitely will not take any advantages from you!\u201d\u2018Upstanding??\u2019Sneakily the little phoenix stuck his little head back out again and used his claw to scratch her neck.\u2018The female demon actually had the nerve to call herself upstanding? And not taking advantages of others?\u2019\u2018Did the sun rise from the west?\u2019Acting as if nothing had occurred, Huang Yue Li pushed the little phoenix back inside again.Walking to the second chest, she opened it up.\u201cWa~It really is a Nine Part Whip! It is a Third Level on too, and there\u2019s two of them!\u201dIn the third chest\u2026\u2026\u201cWa~ Spirit Gathering Beads! Do you know that the Profound Jewel is capable of increasing cultivation speed!\u201dThe fourth chest\u2026\u2026Fifth chest\u2026\u2026Once the last three chest were opened, they caused the onlookers to become further crossed-eyed and astounded.That was a complete Profound Armor set. All thirteen pieces were sitting in the three chests quietly. Just from looking at exterior appearances, you would be able to identify they were from the same set.\u201c\u2026\u2026Profound Armor Set! It really is a Profound Armor Set!\u201dUnable to bear any longer, Grandmaster Yan leapt forward. Kneeling on the ground, he took out the items from the chest and began to carefully inspect them.\u201cReally is a Third Level Profound Armor Set. How could this be? How did this happen? These is practically godly in skill!\u201dThis time, Huang Yue Li did not stop him, but merely stood to the side smiling. She waited for him to finish.Finally she said: \u201cOld man, how is it? I didn\u2019t lie to you right?\u201dPutting the armament in his hands down, Grandmaster Yan walked to Huang Yue Li and directly gave himself a big slap.\u201cYoung Master, this old man has eyes but failed to recognise Mount Tai. I have offended you. I ask this great one with great magnanimity to forgive this old man\u2019s blindness!\u201dSmiling, Huang Yue Li said: \u201cOffending\u2026\u2026you do not have to worry. But the thing we were just discussing\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYoung Master please rest assured. This badge is only given to esteemed guests of our Armament Master Association. When you visit the association, all the materials can be used however you like! I just\u2026\u2026want to ask a presumptuous question, these armaments\u2026\u2026which great master refined them?\u201dCautiously and carefully, Grandmaster Yan asked this.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Due to his status, it is not convenient for him to descend down the mountain away from the sect. So he had asked me to sell them in his place.\u201dAnnouncing she was the refiner was not sensible. Her current cultivation was nothing, unable to protect herself at all.Saying that they were family treasures were also not likely. Apart from the Royal Family, there was no one who possessed the ability to take out this many armaments.Furthermore, if she were to refine more in the future it was certain that she would need to bring them out again. At that time, it would be unexplainable.As a result, she created this fake master. This was the best method.Grandmaster Yan exclaimed out: \u201cIt really is the work of a large sect\u2019s powerful Armament Master. Presumptuously can I ask\u2026\u2026what tier is your master at?\u201d\u201cYou do not need to ask this.\u201dInside, Grandmaster Yan\u2019s bewilderment increased.Taking out this many Third Level Armaments at once, including a Profound Armor Armament, at the very least this master should be at the Fifth Tier!Even within those large sects, this was someone who could easily call the wind and summon the rain.This young master standing in front of him, as the disciple to that master, he must not offend in any circumstances!In a split second, his attitude became abnormally subservient. He nodded his head to Huang Yue Li, like he wanted to give up offerings to her.Beaming with joy, Shopkeeper Sun proclaimed to all those present: \u201cFellow guests, we have witnessed everything. Thus our Thousand Treasure Pavilion will hold an exclusive auction for these Third Level Armaments. How valuable Third Level Armaments are, I am sure I do not need to say? This is an once in a blue moon opportunity ah. You must cannot miss this everyone.\u201d\u201cMy god. These armaments are really going to be auctioned?\u201d\u201cLiving this long, this is my first time actually seeing Third Level Armaments. And this many!\u201d\u201cHow good it will be if you could buy one. These are family heirloom worth treasures. Losing the family\u2019s fortune would be worth it for them!\u201d\u201cHehe, you sure dream well. In the capital, there are so many aristocrats with plenty of money. Will your turn ever come?\u201dThere were also people loudly asking: \u201cWhen will the auction be held?\u201dA smile was splayed across Shopkeeper Sun\u2019s face.\u201cOnce the time and date has been settled, Thousand Treasure Pavilion will send invitations. I ask everyone to be patient.\u201dMaking an impassioned motion, Shopkeeper Sun scattered the surrounding crowd.With a smile that was not quite a smile, Huang Yue Li spoke: \u201cShopkeeper Sun. Think that I\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026have yet to promise you that I will auction my armaments at your store?\u201dSolemnly, Shopkeeper Sun bowed to her: \u201cYoung Master, let us discuss this inside. Any conditions you have, please feel free to raise them.\u201d\u2026\u2026Inside the VIP guestroom.Huang Yue Li was seated in the host\u2019s seat.Grandmaster Yan who previously emitted an arrogant and proud aura was standing respectfully to the side pouring tea for her.The business clauses were swiftly settled by both parties.In order to secure this major business offered by this disciple, he had wholly conceded.Thousand Treasure Pavilion would shoulder all expenses incurred in advertising and venue allocation. As for the commission, they would only obtain two percent of the total earnings from this auction.This was only one tenth of the usual industry commissions!Apart from that, Shopkeeper Sun also presented her a VIP black card. In all of the Thousand Treasure Pavilion branch stores, she would be able to enjoy twenty percent off for all purchases.\u201cYoung Master, for this batch of armaments we will pay you three hundred thousand as down payment. May I ask where to send this to?\u201dThinking for a moment, Huang Yue Li replied: \u201cYou do not need to give it to me now. I ask of you to collect all of the herbs in this list. Deduct the money from the auctions earnings. Once everything has been settled, I will collect my sum.\u201dFull of promises Shopkeeper Sun was.At this time, a small serving boy came knocking.\u201cShopkeeper, the Master has just come to the store. He wants to meet with the Young Master selling the armaments.\u201dYou can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The silver mask that covered his eyes and brows portrayed him as both mysterious and dangerous.His build was tall with an overbearing and arrogant air. He was only sitting, yet he gave an intense sense of strength that could not be resisted. This caused people to unconsciously bow down their heads.This was clearly\u2026\u2026the man whom she had meet near her courtyard a few days ago.How coincidental. These two people were meeting again.The serving boy who led the way was only an ordinary person. Standing at the entrance, he gave a quick bow and ran off pale faced.Calmly looking at Huang Yue Li, the man found that she a faint frown on her face. But this quickly disappeared.He was a bit surprised.No matter how you looked at it, this \u201cyoung master\u201d in front of him did not possess the slightest shred of profound qi. He should not be this tranquil in front of someone like him, who was this powerful\u2026\u2026Deserving to the little fox that caught his eye!Staying silent for a while, the man spoke. \u201cYoung Sir, please sit!\u201dHuang Yue Li didn\u2019t cause a fuss and sat across from him. She asked: \u201cYou are the the owner of Thousand Treasure Pavilion? Don\u2019t know the purpose of you wanting to see me?\u201dThe man\u2019s ink black eyes rested on her face for a duration before responding: \u201cTo see a seller take out this many Third Level Armaments is a rare sight to see. This one is very interested in becoming friends with this Young Sir.\u201dFeeling the gaze of those eyes, Huang Yue Li felt immense pressure.The man was dangerous, extremely dangerous!Her soul was very powerful. Though her soul had suffered greatly from that explosion, her soul was much stronger than the average person.But this man only used a single gaze to make her feel pressured. This caused her feel ill at ease.It meant that his strength was higher than the fifth level of the Dream Profound Realm.With her current trashy strength, she could not provoke him!Cautiously Huang Yue said: \u201cLord Owner, you are jesting. Third Level Armaments are not that hard to see. And towards an expert like you, it cannot count as anything! Furthermore, I am nothing more than an apprentice Armament Refiner. The creator of those armaments is not me either. I simply do not have any qualifications to become your friend.\u201dThe man\u2019s mouth curved, \u201cApprentice\u2026\u2026\u2026Armament Refiner?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Those Third Level Armaments were all refined by my master. I am only selling them in his place.\u201dAt this moment, Huang Yue Li was very pleased at her smooth acting. She also compiled some lines to say too. Otherwise, it would be hard explain and defend against anything.This man was extremely powerful, but if he was able to obtain any benefit from her, it would be extremely beneficial to him.Unfortunately Huang Yue Li always knew herself well. Cheating others is very amusing, but if there was too large of a gap between them, it would she would turn to scheming tiger but losing her fur as well. Most of the time, she would not be able to retreat unscathed.It was best to show respect from a distance.Lightly he laughed. The sound of his laugh was deep and very sexy. It was full of tantalising charm.\u201cIs that right? These armaments were not refined by you? Then two days earlier, why did you come to Thousand Treasure Pavilion to by an armament furnace? Where did those armaments materials also disappear to? Third Young Miss Bai?\u201dYou can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her Appearance Changing Technique was obtained from a exceptional master\u2019s hands. There were very few who it failed to deceived.What was most concerning was the method in which this man linked the seller of the armaments to Wu Wei Manor\u2019s Third Young Miss\u2026\u2026how did he make the connection?Currently, she was a peak grade trash ah! Who would think a good-for-nothing could smelt armaments?Huang Yue Li\u2019s facial colour did not change as she answered back: \u201cOwner, what words are you speaking. How come I cannot understand?\u201d\u201cCannot understand?\u201d The man smirked, \u201cDo you need me to speak more clearly?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cAs chance may have it, this one has some knowledge and insight into armaments. Two days earlier, included within the list of materials that you purchased where ingredients to creating a long sword. The Xiao Xiang Bamboo is also a necessary component in the Nine Part Whip. The North River Mica is the alos the base material used to link different components together\u2026\u2026\u2026each and every material was chosen as so. Is this truly a mere coincidence?\u201dCalmly, Huang Yue Li smiled: \u201cOwner\u2019s meaning is\u2026there was someone who also bought those materials? Isn\u2019t that just too much of a coincidence? Unfortunately, that person was not me. Today is the first time that I have ever visited Thousand Treasure Pavilion. You have recognised the wrong person!\u201dLowering his line of sight, the man\u2019s gaze was still sharp. But that faint trace of a smile had never left his face.\u201cEn, buying the same materials can of course be a coincidence. But there is something even more coincidental.\u201dLeisurely he continued: \u201cThat day, this one happened to pass by Thousand Treasure Pavilion and also happened to see Third Young Miss Bai leaving from there too. In all likelihood, Third Young Miss should know when martial practitioners reach a certain level, they can recognise others from their soul trace. In my presence, your Appearance Changing Technique does not have any use!\u201dHuang Yue Li suddenly stood up, her expression wasn\u2019t too good.This man really did see through her technique. He was not ignorant!It was either because he had cultivated to a very high realm or that he specialised in the techniques pertaining to the soul.She had foolishly assumed she could trick him. Playing around for half a day, it was him who was playing her!\u201cThat\u2019s right, I truly did use an Appearance Changing Technique! But Lord Owner, why must you fuss and not forgive this? I am merely a merchant. Thousand Treasure Pavilion longtime rule is to never ask about the seller\u2019s identity. Why are you digging up the roots to find the truth? What is your aim?\u201dSitting in his chair, the man swept his gaze from top to bottom. In an indifferent voice, he replied: \u201c\u201dThird Young Miss, why must you be this sharp? This one does not have any particular motives. I only want to collaborate with you!\u201cCollaborate?\u201d\u201cCorrect. It is really simple, I only want you to refine some special armaments. To an Armament Master who can refine Third Level Profound ArmorArmaments, this should not be something so difficult.\u201dWith her previous coldly expressionless face, Huang Yue Li responded to him. \u201cLord Owner, I really am not the person you think me to be. I am also not some Armament Master. It would better for you to find someone more qualified! Good bye!\u201dAs she finished speaking, he turned around to leave.No matter how this man saw through her identity, no matter how he tricked her, she would not admit to her Armament Master status.The reason being, she did not want to collaborate with a strong person if she did not have a method to control him.However, just as she reached the door, a strong gust of wind blew through.\u201cBang!\u201d It sounded loudly and clearly. The room\u2019s door was slammed shut by the man\u2019s profound qi.Following that, the balance within Huang Yue Li\u2019s body was lost as her back heavily smashed into a wall. A wave of dizziness then erupted.By the time she could react, both her her wrists were being held by him. Firmly, they were clasped above her head.The man\u2019s sturdy and large body, forcefully trapped her. Wrapping up her small and petite body within.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But Huang Yue Li could also sense the man\u2019s powerfully domineering scent that was full of charm.She completely lacked any power to resist. Until the jarring truth of absolute might, any trickery was unable to succeed.Lowering his head, the man whispered with a chuckle in her ear: \u201cThird Young Miss Bai, why are you running? Our conversation\u2026\u2026\u2026I think has yet to end?\u201dBurning hot air blew onto the sensitive earlobe, the temperature of her face rose accordingly.Her heart skipped a beat.This type of extreme danger with no ability to resist kind of feeling, suddenly made her feel a sense of familiarity.Unknowingly, a memory from her past life flashed through her mind.\u2026\u2026Many years before in the ancient ruins at the Western Desolate Mountains, she met Mu Cheng Ying for the very first time. They had a big fight over a Ninth Grade Demonic Beast\u2019s inner core.At that time, she was a top tier talent being arduously cultivated by the Mythical Flame Palace. She also believed herself to be peerless among those of the same generation. Unfortunately in Mu Cheng Ying\u2019s presence, she could not even defend against three of his strikes.This man was also like that. Pushing her against the wall, ambiguously lowering his head, whispering next to her ear.\u201cOne kiss in exchange for a Ninth Grade Demonic Beast\u2019s inner core? This transaction isn\u2019t bad right? Hmm?\u201dHuang Yue Li was angered to the point that she really wanted to kill him with one slap. But unknowingly to her, Mu Cheng Ying used a technique to seal her acupuncture points.Under the circumstance where she could not move an inch, the male\u2019s thin lips curved as they covered hers. It then turned into a light sucking of the lip, lingering and connecting.In the end, Mu Cheng Ying reluctantly pulled away. Stuffing the inner core into her hands, he sighed: \u201cSuch a shame that I still have important matters to do. Otherwise, I would really like to accompany you. Obediently wait for me to go find you!\u201dFondly and with reluctance, he placed another light kiss on her lips. Following that, he disappeared with a flash.\u201cI will wait for you to die!!!\u201dIt was the first time that Huang Yue Li fell so hard, also suffering such a large loss. It angered her to the point of insanity.Furiously, she wiped her lips turned red from the kiss. And the not to be mentioned first kiss\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cLittle girl, what plot are you cooking up now?\u201dThe man\u2019s deep voice rumbled abruptly, alerting Huang Yue Li to her already wandering mind.Right at that very moment, she had thought of Mu Cheng Ying\u2026\u2026\u2026Was it because this man\u2019s temperament was also dominating and caused one\u2019s heart to quake?Moving her wrists, Huang Yue Li realised that she did not could resist. She was completely at his mercy and could only give up.Clenching her teeth, \u201cI said, I am not some Third Young Miss Bai!\u201d\u201cYou are not?\u201dThe man lightly smiled. Closing in on her face, those thin but perfectly shaped lips stood out. At such close proximity, it seemed as if they would land on her face in the next moment.Huang Yue Li\u2019s entire being was stiff.\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201dCould it be\u2026\u2026he also wanted to forcibly kiss her?Swiftly following that, a warm feeling could be felt from her face.But what had landed was not that man\u2019s lips, but his finger instead.The slender and strong finger that seemed to be carved from a piece of white jade, slide lightly across her face. It was like he was pampering and consoling her.The man carefully and attentively traced every single part of her face. Afterwards he clasped her chin as he measured upwards and downwards. Finally he said: \u201cYou look\u2026\u2026barely passable.\u201dAt first, Huang Yue Li didn\u2019t know what he was doing, but very quickly she caught on.Unknown as to what method he used, he had removed her fake identity!You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And on top of that, commenting on her appearance!Truth be told, her current body could not be considered to be a beauty. At most she could be called delicate.In comparison to the four great beauties in her past life, it really could not be considered anything.However, strength was more important than appearance within the eyes of Huang Yue Li. Based on the fact that Bai Ruo Li possessed the Flame Spirit Physique, made her happier than having some amazing appearance!Speaking of which, what sprout could this man considered as? What qualifications does he have to evaluate her appearance?\u201cLord Owner, the way I look I think has nothing to do with our collaboration right?\u201d\u201cCollaboration?\u201d Finding it laughable, he replied: \u201cYou say collaboration? Did you not deny the fact that you are Bai Ruo Li? Furthermore, you also said that you were not some Armament Master?\u201dSince she was already exposed, what was the point of pretending to be some garlic clove??Glared her eyes fiercely. Angry as she was, she also seemed to soften down.\u201cLord Owner, I truly did lie to you but I ask for your understanding. I am but a weak female. Going outside I will be easily bullied, so I have no choice but to put on a disguise. I did not purposely want to cheat and lie. Pinching me with such strength, it just too painful. Can you first let go of me? Whatever you want to collaborate with, we can talk about it\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dBatting her eyes, a few tear drops started to form.This attitude, coupled with her originally petite frame fully portrayed her \u2018weak and feeble female\u2019 look.Any man who saw this will feel pity and couldn\u2019t bear to hurt her any longer.But this man nearly burst out laughing.Just this two-faced slyness, steel hearted treacherous actioned little fox had the nerve to call herself a \u2018weak and feeble female\u2019? She was also afraid that she would be bullied?Clearly when she walked on the wide streets, it should be other people who needed to worry whether or not they will be bullied by her!Furthermore, if he were to release her, this girl would mostly likely resist with all her might in the next moment. She might even use some method to attract attention. He was not that stupid!Mouth still curved, the man answered her: \u201cI find this position not that bad. No need to change, just speak like this!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026okay. Go speak.\u201dSeeing he did not fall for it, Huang Yue Li had no more cards to play. She could only listening attentively.He continued: \u201cThese Third Level Armaments, did you really make them?\u201dHuang Yue Li nodded her head.She was already exposed, there was no meaning in continuing her lie.\u201cThen this Lord cannot understand. Your body does not have any inkling or trace of profound qi, neither your is soul power that high. You are not even dual attributed in fire and metal. How did you refine those armaments? They are also Third Levelled Armaments!\u201dHuang Yue Li pursed her lips together, \u201cI cannot tell you this. If you are to question and investigate further, not matter what you do, I will no longer form any kind of partnership with you.\u201dCalmly, he looked at her for a while before beginning to laugh.\u201cOkay then, I will ask no more. Everyone has their own secrets. This Lord isn\u2019t someone who wants to know everything.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good then.\u201d Huang Yue Li let out a breath of relief.But she did not know what the man thought in his heart: not knowing for now it nothing to worry over. After all, this little fox will become his person. Everything regarding her, he will know sooner or later.What need does impatience have now?Thinking for a moment, Huang Yue Li said: \u201cI can clearly tell you this, Third Level Armaments are the highest I can refine currently and only a few specific kinds. I don\u2019t even know what kind of armaments you want? There is a high possibility that I am unable to complete your request.\u201dYou can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It could take quite a long time?\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dSensing that she might be able to rid herself of this man, Huang Yue Li followed with some exaggerated tones. \u201cYou should also know, the rising of each tier for an Armament Master is a very difficult task.

How many are unable to cross this gap!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine, this Lord can wait for you to be promoted. You are very intelligent, you definitely will be able to rise quickly. \u201d\u201cYou!\u201dHuang Yue Li could not understand why this man must insist on her?Under the great sky, there were many Armament Masters. Although for the small South Yue country, Third Tier Armament Masters were already a rarity, for a powerful expert like him it should very simple for him to find an Advanced Armament Master.Why must he make things difficult for her?\u201cHow was that?\u201dThe man shortened the distance once again.The fingers that were holding her face unwillingly parted.Although his tone was one of dislike, in his heart he was quite pleased with this little fox.Though this little fox wasn\u2019t those beauties who would take someone\u2019s breath away at first sight, but that pair of intelligent phoenix shaped eyes that seemed to speak for themselves. They contained a flowing and mystical kind of charm, a force that wanted to take your soul away.The skin on her hands were like the highest grade silk; they felt so smooth and fine. There was still those tender lips. They were like a blooming sakura blossom, pouty, tender and soft\u2026\u2026\u2026Her body was just too young; short and flat. Clearly her development wasn\u2019t complete.Too rough.\u2026\u2026\u2026un-bite worthy.Her back shivering again, Huang Yue Li hurriedly said: \u201cYour meaning, I already understand. How about this, look, you already can see that I have not reached the Fourth Tier, promising you anything now will be useless. It would be best for you to look around and see if there are any other Armament Masters who can help you. If you truly cannot find anyone, then you can wait for me to be promoted before discussing anything\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe man lightly chuckled.How could he not hear her underlying tone. This little girl still wanted to find a method to refuse him.But, those words\u2026\u2026\u2026he was not in a hurry.\u201cOkay then. This Lord will give you some time, you can carefully consider it\u2026\u2026\u201dHuang Yue Li let out a breath of relief.This man didn\u2019t seem to be one who was not reasonable\u2026\u2026\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026But, this Lord will not accept refusal as an answer. You must take this time to carefully think it over!\u201dDamn, wasn\u2019t he playing with her? Why the frick would she need to think about it!At this time, Huang Yue Li that she had unknowingly regained the freedom of movement. Straightening her back, she swiftly kicked towards the lower body of the man.This kick was very quick and unexpected with an unusual angle. But the man\u2019s reaction was very fast and he dodged to the side.Huang Yue Li did not think that she would be able to land her kick. Seeing that he dodged, with a quick move of her body, she left the room.Unexpectedly, taking a few steps outside she felt her waist tighten.The man\u2019s sturdy arm was wrapped around her waist. With a tightening motion, he pulled her into his embrace.From her ear, the man\u2019s angry voice sounded: \u201cLittle thing, you are still\u2026\u2026\u2026very ruthless! Not afraid that your kick might disable me!\u201dHe was nearly scared into cold sweat.The kick of hers clearly was some profound skill with very good practical skill. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she did not possess profound qi allowing him to dodge in time, then he would really have suffered!The position which she kicked towards was very accurate and precise. Just imaging the result made him ache slightly.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He must keep a watchful eye on her.If he let down his guard, not only would he lose the person, he would also have fallen into a ditch\u2026\u2026On the other hand, Huang Yue Li was feeling very regretful ; she did not kick the man disabled! Harassing an innocent girl as soon as he met her. You could tell he was not a decent one immediately!Rolling her eyes, she innocently said: \u201cLord Owner, what are you saying? How come I can not understand you? I kicked you? That was because my body had finally regained movement after being stiff for such a long time. As I was stretching, I accidentally moved my leg outwards!\u201d\u201cThat so? Then why did you run away?\u201dGazing down at her tender white earlobe, he restrained the urge to bite down it from behind.\u201cDid I run? We have already finished discussing our business, so I was preparing to returning home early to rest!\u201d\u201cTurns out it was like this\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEn, that is correct. So you can release me!\u201dBut the man not release his hand. On the contrary he went to tighten his arms, pulling her even closer.He did not understand why this delicate and soft body was so agreeable with him. When he touched her, it constantly caused him to feel jittery and unstable, becoming very disturbed inside.Waiting for a while, Huang Yue Li realised he had no intention to move. She creased her brows.\u201cRelease me!\u201dReplying, the man lowered his head and smiled: \u201cSeeing as you are a \u2018delicate\u2019 female beauty and by going out, \u2018you will be easily bullied by others\u2019. So this Lord finds it necessary to personally escort you home. Not need to feel grateful!\u201d\u201cNo need. I said, no need!\u201dTurning a deaf ear to her protests his arm still circled around her waist, the man dragged her out through the backdoor and stuffed her into the horse carriage.When she saw the extravagant and black horse carriage, Huang Yue Li came to realisation. She now knew the reason her identity was exposed.When she had first come here to buy things, this man already had his eye on her.Just at that time, all onlookers thought she was ruining the family. No one believed she could refine any armaments. Why was this man so certain she would succeed?She directly asked him.Curving his lips, he answered, \u201cThat probably is\u2026\u2026\u2026a male\u2019s intuition?\u201d\u201cListen to your nonsense! Don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t say!\u201dPursing her lips, Huang Yue Li felt too lazy to deal with him. Sitting inside, she began to observe the structure of the carriage and the various carvings and charms engraved on the walls.This horse carriage was a type of movement armament, a hundred times more valuable than a Profound Armor Set. Very difficult to make and also required many precious and rare materials.Ordinarily speaking, it would a masterpiece of an Eight Tier Armament Master. Even for her, it possessed great referencing value.Since she had the opportunity to enter one, she was very interested in closely examining it.Relaxing and reclining backwards, the man observed the little girl that caught his eye. Her bright pair of eyes were travelling around the entire carriage; looking here and there and constantly mumbling to herself.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026En, this structure uses a very new concept\u2026\u2026wu, isn\u2019t this spell charm too poorly drawn? It is already affecting the overall defence of the carriage!\u201dIt was a true mystery as to how she became a Third Tier Armament Master without any profound qi.But this little girl\u2026\u2026\u2026truly did have great talent in armament refining!He seemed to have unexpectedly picked up a real gem!The smile hanging on the corners of his mouth became even wider. His heart was set on winning this girl over.Picking up the teapot, he personally poured it and brought it over to Huang Yue Li.\u201cThat should be enough running around here and there. Stop and drink some tea. If you have an interest towards this horse carriage, there will plenty of time and chances in the future for you to examine it.\u201dYou can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although it was a fire type, it was very gentle. As a result, it was often made into tea. It was a very loved beverage by all fire attributed martial practitioners.Armament Masters especially welcomed and loved this herb.Drinking a sip of tea, Huang Yue Li lifted her gaze and looked at the man opposite her.This man was neither fire attributed or an Armament Master. Clearly he was attempting to curry favour with her.Coupled with his previous ambiguous attitude, it couldn\u2019t be that\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026he had taken a fancy to her?While considering it, Huang Yue Li prevented it from revealing out through her face.Not long later, the horse carriage stopped into front Wu Wei Manor\u2019s back courtyard\u2019s front gate.Impatiently, Huang Yue Li pulled open the door preparing to leave.\u201cLord Owner, I thank you for your hospitality today. I will definitely research the dao of refining in an attempts to advance more quickly! Please rest assured! Before I advance, I will not disturb you and could you please not disturb my cultivation too. Let us say farewell here!\u201dReaching out, the man caught her wrist.\u201cThe carriage has yet to come to a complete stop, what is the rush? What if you fall? You are ugly enough, if you were to fall and produce a scar, then you won\u2019t be able to marry.\u201d\u201cThat! Has! Nothing! To! Do! With! You!\u201dThat was enough!Was this man\u2019s formal name \u2018Poison Tongue\u2019 and his nickname \u2018looking for a spanking\u2019?He was practically the same as that shameless Mu Cheng Ying! She really met a ghost!She was born proud. If it was a different man who dared to be this frivolous and spoke this rudely to her, he would long turned into something that wasn\u2019t a ghost or a human.Such a shame, her current strength couldn\u2019t compare to him!What was more infuriating was this man clearly knew this fact. He was taking full advantage of it.Holding her wrist, he escorted Huang Yue Li all the way to her the courtyard\u2019s front gate. He halted his steps once he arrived.\u201cRest assured, since your armaments are in this Lord\u2019s hands they will certainly sell for a good price.\u201d Reaching his hand out, he lightly brushed back her stray hair, \u201cWait for my good news.\u201d\u201cI understand, good bye!\u201dSwatting his hand, Huang Yue Li turned around and entered her courtyard. She did not spare a single glance at him.Watching her back view, the man helplessly shook his head. Sighing, he said to himself: \u201cWhy is she this arrogantly cute?\u201dWith his cultivation talent, his identity coupled with that extraordinary looking face, he always received the affection of women. How many noble born princesses willingly took action and suffered losses against him to gain his attention.The first time he took the initiative to gain a girl\u2019s goodwill, he believed that he would succeed in catching her.Except that in reality, Huang Yue Li did not give him any face and this has made him hit a nail in his attempts.But, because it was like this, that made him all the more interested.(Note: Play these kinds of men like a fiddle HYL. Go, go, go!)\u2026\u2026Returning to her back courtyard, Huang Yue Li\u2019s mood was still very sour.She felt that it was a great failure to not check the calendar before leaving the house today!The selling of armaments should have been a very simple and easy affair, but she was very unlucky to provoke such a powerful man. A super large headache!Looked like she must go to get lengths to avoid this man in the future.Afterall, once she received her pay from the armaments and received the herbs, Huang Yue Li had long planned to go into closed-door cultivation. At that time, she no longer needed to have any more dealings with that mysterious man.Unfortunately, shortly after she returned, some people had come knocking.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I do not need it?\u201d\u201cMaster said, if you see it you will definitely like it.\u201dMoving to the side, the bodyguard revealed the thing from behind him.Observing the object, Huang Yue Li\u2019s eyes widened; it was an exquisite Armament Furnace!This furnace was about as tall as a person, much smaller than the usual sized furnace. The purple light that it released was the deciding factor that also set it apart from its peers, distinguishing itself.Huang Yue Li someone who could understand the value of items. Instantly, she could tell that it was made of Amethyst-Green Gold, nine times refined. It would last, at least to the Seventh Tier!There wasn\u2019t anything that attracted an Armament Master\u2019s gaze more than this. Furthermore, the furnace she currently used was that shoddy one she used eight hundred silvers to buy. This caused the furnace in front of her to become more praiseworthy and appealing.That mysterious man was far too sinister and crafty. Gifting this over, how did he expect her to reject?She nodded her head, \u201cThen move it inside.\u201dA couple guards then ran in, swiftly carrying the furnace away. Listening to Huang Yue Li\u2019s instructions, they placed it in the correct position. Simultaneously, they also carried in various chests filled with Third Level materials.\u201cYoung Miss Bai, my master said these are here to help you advance to the Fourth Tier more quickly. These were especially prepared for you. If you have any other needs and wants, please go to Thousand Treasure Pavilion and seek out our master.\u201d\u201cEn, I got it.\u201dMoney that is delivered to you, it would be waste to reject it. If she had known that this man was this great, she should have exploited him more.Waving the bodyguard off, Huang Yue Li turned around to see Cai Wei staring at her foolishly.\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d She asked strangely.Cai Wei walked over and shut the door securely. Finally she said in a hushed voice: \u201cThird Young Miss, this is\u2026\u2026\u2026is this servant seeing correctly. Did a man just escort you home? And these armament materials, where they also gifted from him?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dA bit unpleased, Huang Yue Li pursed her lips together.Cai Wei was nothing more than a serving girl. She could tolerate her fussing due to her great loyalty. But if she dared to involve herself with her private matters, that would be overstepping her boundaries!Without delay, Cai Wei responded: \u201cThird Young Miss, please don\u2019t be angry. This servant doesn\u2019t have any meaning. It\u2019s only\u2026\u2026\u2026a couple days ago, Second Madam accused you of having an illicit relationship with a man.

As long as she possessed enough ability, what harm can a few random rumors do to her?\u201cAi-ya, Third Young Miss!\u201d Cai Wei was worried, \u201cWhy do you not treat this seriously? Very soon the Crown Prince will be choosing his Imperial Concubine. If word were to spread out, questioning your innocence, then you will have no chance of become the Crown Prince\u2019s Imperial Concubine!\u201dFor a moment, Huang Yue Li believed she had misheard.\u201cEh? What Crown Prince? The Crown Prince choosing his Imperial Concubine\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026what has that got to do with me?\u201dCai Wei answered: \u201cThird Young Miss, do you not remember? Back when the Old Lord was still here, he and the Emperor had a verbal agreement to wed you and the Crown Prince. Since the the disappearance of the Old Lord, the matter was never discussed again.

After the initial nine levels in the Qi Profound Realm, only one can attack the bottleneck towards that realm. This is completed by absorbing the profound qi around them and using it to create a thin layer around them, ascending to the Defensive Profound Realm.For the Crown Prince to reach the Defensive Profound Realm Seventh Level at the age of twenty, he deserves to be called an outstanding cultivator.Her precursor still had this type of verbal agreement with the Crown Prince. Furthermore, Bai Ruo Qi was secretly in love with the Crown Prince!Linking it with the slandering rumors of her having an illicit relationship, forcing her precursor to suicide, had made everything crystal clear.Judging from her assumptions, the Second Madam and Bai Ruo Qi were afraid that she might become the Crown Prince\u2019s Imperial Concubine, while secretly planting that hindering action. They wished for Bai Ruo Li\u2019s reputation to sweep to the floor, killing her in the process. This would help prevent any ill omens to disrupt the good affairs between Bai Ruo Qi and the Crown Prince!\u201cHehe, they really did calculate well!\u201dIt was unfortunate, they bumped into her Huang Yue Li. As Bai Ruo Qi was destined to a tragic ending.If this marriage were to succeed, then she will write the three words Huang Yue Li backwards!Pondering internally for a short duration, she suddenly remembered something and asked: \u201cSpeaking of the Royal Family\u2026\u2026I heard that the Owner of Thousand Treasure Pavilion is also someone from the Royal Family. Is that true?\u201dCai Wei replied: \u201cThis\u2026\u2026rumors say that Thousand Treasure Pavilion\u2019s hidden owner is the Emperor\u2019s nephew, King Dong\u2019An. Who knows if this is true or not?\u201d\u201cKing Dong\u2019An?\u201d Huang Yue Li thought for a bit.This year, King Dong\u2019An would be turning nineteen years old. According to what? they say, he was also gifted in cultivation, his talent just a bit less than the Crown Prince. He was also a Pill Master.Pill Masters were also a rare and valued profession. Adding on the fact that he was also part of the Royal Household, so controlling such a large and influential shop like Thousand Treasure Pavilion was not strange.Could the one she met today, that mysterious man be King Dong\u2019An?But she constantly felt that something was not quite right. That man\u2019s cultivation should have long surpassed the Defensive Profound Realm. And his extravagant style was not something a small country\u2019s King would be capable of portraying. \u2026\u2026Wu Wei ManorMain HallWu Wei Manor\u2019s Madam\u2019s face expressed absolute grief.

How could she land such harsh blows ah. Qi\u2019er is her blood related older cousin!\u201dAs Bai Liu Jing of Wu Wei Manor saw Bai Ruo Qi assisted by a maid walk over, he stood up in shock.

How did she turn into this?\u201dAfter Bai Ruo Qi received Cai Wei\u2019s slaps, she had turned into a true pig head. Not mentioning her two swollen red cheeks, her eyes seemed unable to open fully. Her tears also slid down her face non-stop.This appearance, how could you see any trace of her usual fairy-like lightness and graceful as a cold beauty look?It had taken some time for Bai Liu Jing to recognise his most loved daughter. In fury, he asked: \u201cWhat is this all about? Without any reason, why did Qi\u2019er become like this?!\u201dFalling to the ground, Bai Ruo Qi began to cry out loudly.\u201cDad, you have to support your daughter!

She also wanted to destroy that little slut\u2019s appearence!\u2026\u2026In the past three days, Cai Wei had used the silvers given to her by Huang Yue Li and asked slave brokers to come to their home.Huang Yue Li had then personally chosen ten maids and serving boys.The standards which she chose them: One - not by appearance. Two - not by they working ability, but mainly through their talent.Usually speaking you needed a Talent Testing Stone make an accurate judgement, but Huang Yue Li had another method of telling. This method enabled her to roughly guess the counterpart\u2019s potential.Aside from this, she also looked at their perseverance abilities and loyalty.In those three days, she had viewed all of the possible servants available for purchase in the capital. She then picked out all the ones talented in cultivation from among them.These people, every single one of them then signed a life and death contract with her. Additionally, Huang Yue Li placed a restriction seal on each of them.She planned to observe them for a period of time. Afterwards, she would then select the honest and loyal ones, giving them each a cultivation manual.With her help, sooner of later each one of them would become a fairly decent martial cultivator.When the time comes, Huang Yue Li would have turned them into a strong force at her disposal.Unfortunately today, during the afternoon, a ruckus was heard from outside the courtyard.Very quickly after this, Cai Wei rushed inside to report: \u201cThird Young Miss, this time it is really bad.

At that time, as a lowly serving girl, she would be the first to lose her life! No one would be able to save her!And now the Manor Lord had sent over people for them. Moreover, the people sent were the Manor\u2019s very own Personal Soldier Regiment.Wu Wei Manor\u2019s Personal Guard Regiment was very famous in South Yue. Every single one of them possessed a cultivation higher than the Fifth level of the Qi Profound Realm and were tempered veterans of the battlefield. They were filled with battle experience and blood lust!Completely unable to resist. She also knew that if she was dragged to meet the Manor Lord and Second Young Miss, she already foresaw the types of crimes and punishments that awaited her!Cai Wei was trembling like a leaf.Just was she saw the guards hands were about to grab her, a frosty voice rung out.\u201cRelease your hands!\u201d\u201cBang! Bang!\u201dDust flew up from the ground.The two guards who were in the midst of capturing Cai Wei flew outwards. After flying thirty-forty feet, they landed heavily on the ground!No one expected this type of situation to occur. Momentarily, the entire courtyard lapsed into a period of complete silence.The guard\u2019s commander turned his stunned face and discovered that Huang Yue Li at some unknown time moved in front of Cai Wei. Full of cold indifference, she looked at him.Her clear eyes were currently looking at them with a frost and indifference. Raising her chin slightly, her white dress fluttered along with that slight movement.The guards all looked at each other. Within each of their comrades eyes, they saw extreme shock!This is\u2026\u2026\u2026too unfathomable.This infamous incapable and useless Third Young Miss seemed to look very imposing and threatening. This powerful beyond compare and respectful aura of hers reminded them of the Manor Lord Bai Liu Feng, who went missing ten years prior!Coldly, Huang Yue Li said: \u201cWant to touch my maid, did you ask this Young Miss yet?\u201dThe throw had stunned the two guards, so it was only now that they began to shout out \u201cai-yo, ai-yo\u201d.

Just then, Third Young Miss dashed in front of us and with a wave of her sleeve, we were sent flying\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Commander pursed his lips together.Bai Ruo Li was a good-for-nothing that could not cultivate. While these two guards were experts at the Qi Profound Realm Fifth Level. She could send them flying?She definitely used some despicable means to achieve this, but it would only be able to deal with those ordinary guards. Once she meet a real expert, it would be of no use.He didn\u2019t believe a single shred of their nonsense. Stepping towards Huang Yue Li, he faced her to say: \u201cThird Young Miss, I suggest to stop with your meaningless resistance and take a walk with this subordinate! The Manor Lord is your elder, and has invited you to the Main House to be a guest. Yet you injured the people he has sent over. This is disrespecting your elders. No matter who heard this, they all would say that you are in the wrong!\u201dHuang Yue Li sneered: \u201cOh? That so? Then I, who the Emperor personally bestowed is a Region Princess, while he Bai Liu Jing is a mere Marquis. According to our statuses, he must acknowledge me when he sees me! What authority does he possess to capture my, Region Princess\u2019 maid? And on what authority does he have to send people to trespass on my territory? Does he put the title personally bestowed by the Emperor within his eyes?\u201dYou can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They had long forgotten her status, a genuine Princess that should be respected!The commander was at a loss for words, unable to refute her claims.But the orders of the Manor Lord must be completed.He might as well rip off his hypocritical mask. Laughing sardonically, he swaggered towards her.\u201cThird Miss, don\u2019t talk smart with me! You think that possessing a title will make you a respected Region Princess? Why don\u2019t you go take a piss? Not even looking at the yourself, the piece of trash you are. What can your status do for you? You can\u2019t even measure us bodyguards! You dare to oppose against the Manor Lord\u2019s orders? Refusing a toast and being forced to drink it. Don\u2019t blame me for being hard handed!\u201dFinishing, as fast as lightning he chopped towards Huang Yue Li.By his estimations, this Third Miss had was a chicken-hearted trash. Once she saw such an aggressive attack, she wouldn\u2019t be able to control herself and start to pee.\u201cThird Young Miss\u2014\u2014\u2014!!\u201dAlarmed, Cai Wei screeched out.On of the contrary, Huang Yue Li maintained a face of tranquilness. There was even a trace of a sneering smile within her eyes.Already charging towards her, the commander felt his head throb when he neared her. The next moment, his mind became blank.Following that was an acute sense of pain from his chest. The sounds of cracking ribs soon echoed in his ears. Without his control, his body flew backwards and landed very heavily onto the ground.Because the one thrown was the leader of those guards, the rest of guard stared at Huang Yue Li in blatant shock.That move just then, they finally saw clearly.Just then, one of Huang Yue Li\u2019s fist had sent their powerful commander flying.That fist of hers wasn\u2019t really fast, but for some reason he was unable to to dodge. It almost seemed like he willingly charged towards it.Huang Yue Li\u2019s hand looked so slender and pale; it seemed so fragile that it could not hold a simple vegetable knife. Let alone sending a grown man flying, sprawling on the ground.This this this\u2026\u2026\u2026were they dreaming?Clapping away the dust in her hands, Huang Yue Li beamed: \u201cGreat Commander, you are truly too impolite. Coming over as a guest, yet you are lying on the owner\u2019s property leisurely refusing to stand up. Tsk tsk, truly someone who came from this Manor. Do you not understand basic etiquette?\u201dInnocently and pure was her smile. Just like a noble family\u2019s treasured daughter who had yet to see the evils of the world.In truth, without any profound qi she did not have enough power to send him flying. What she relied on was a profound skill to counter the force that he applied back onto himself.Unfortunately that commander\u2019s level wasn\u2019t high enough to comprehend the such a profound skill.When Huang Yue Li said those words, the mean had begun to groggily regain conscious. When he heard her words, he nearly spit out blood from anger.He shouted out: \u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026how dare you? I am someone sent by the Manor Lord!\u201dBlinking her eyes, Huang Yue Li was quite perplexed, \u201cWhat Monkey Lord, Chicken Lord? This is still a Region Princess\u2019 Residence. Not any Dick, Tom or Harry can enter as they please. If you people are willingly to slave away for your Monkey Lord, I cannot say anything. Though, I am still a human, a different grade from you all. \u201dAngered to death the commander was. Furiously he gnashed his teeth and said: \u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026you\u2026\u2026\u2026all you go! Go and arrest her and that serving girl!\u201dThe guards looked at each other, none of them daring to move.The Third Young Miss was too nefarious.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Due to this shocking event, they were still scared senseless.Furiously the commander raged: \u201cUseless things! You are this easily scared? She had only used a evil technique. All of you go attack together! Whoever dares to disobey the Manor Lord\u2019s command today will be captured and punished!\u201dAfter a moment\u2019s hesitation, one by one they began to move.No matter what, the manor Lord was the one who controlled their life and death, as well as their future.No matter how great the Third Young Miss is, with so many of them present would they still fear her?Clenching down, the guards decided to use their numbers to forcibly take down the Third Young Miss!Facing the entire group of guards, Huang Yue Li did not become at all flustered.Calmly and leisurely, she took a step back.\u201cTing! Shing! Shing! Ting!!\u201dA crisp sound rang.In the area that she was standing earlier, numerous metallic thorns shot out. The metal thorns were like sinister silver teeth, drilling out of the ground.The charging were stunned by this unexpected turn of events. Unable to halt their progress, they stepped straight onto the thorns.One can only imagine the unbearable pain that comes from iron thorns three inches long. Those thorns completely skewered through their feet, resulting in their fall. Unfortunately, what greeted them were more of these thorns piercing into their bodies.\u201cAH! What is this??\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s spikes! There\u2019s spikes on the ground! Ah, so painful! Why is there even more?? Why can\u2019t I pull them out??\u201d\u201cSave me! Those behind, don\u2019t push, don\u2019t push, ah ah ah\u2014\u2014!\u201dIn a blink of an eye, bloodcurdling screams and cries filled the area.Huang Yue Li smiled sardonically. These people\u2026\u2026these people really didn\u2019t know better. They dared to provoke her in her territory.As everyone know, the nest of an Armament Master were filled with traps and mechanisms on every step. \u3002Because expert Armament Masters were skilled in mechanisms and skills, they would make their lairs into a place fortified by metals and walls and a burning moat.Looking for trouble in the turf of a Armament Master was willingly sending themselves to their own demise!After Huang Yue Li received the furnace and gifts from the mysterious man, she began to improve the back courtyard out of habit.What she didn\u2019t expect was for those improvements to be used this quickly!Shaking her head, she let out a sigh: \u201cAi, this Miss gave you a chance, but you insisted on recklessly charging forward. I really don\u2019t understand why? Are you people really this dumb\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dTurning her head, she went to asked Cai Wei: \u201cThis dumb? Isn\u2019t it called stupid coming?\u201dCai Wei was thoroughly stunned. Groggily she replied: \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAiyo! It was that time Fourth Sister was running around naked in front of our residence. That uncle, what did he say she came from?\u201dBlankly, Cai Wei answered: \u201cLikes to be whipped? A masochist?\u201d\u201cRight, right, right, a masochist! Cai Wei, your memory isn\u2019t bad. Good future prospect!\u201dLooking at the guards lying on the ground, bleeding everywhere, Huang Yue Li beamed at them whilst making a conclusion: \u201cSo you are all masochists! Furthermore, your tastes are so strong! Why do you like to be covered in blood?\u201dThe little phoenix used his little wing to cover his eyes as he couldn\u2019t bear to look anymore.This female demon is becoming more and more twisted. Who is the one with strong tastes? Who was it that caused them to be drenched in blood? How is she not embarrassed to talk about others?Looking at her in stupor, the commander was rendered speechless.Walking to him, Huang Yue Li smiled down: \u201cThis uncle, slave to a monkey, what other advice do you wish to give?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u2026\u2026don\u2019t\u2026\u2026\u2026don\u2019t have any\u2026\u2026\u201dThe commander\u2019s whole body trembled in fear.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Iron blooded soldiers molded through countless battles on the battlefield, was not enough to make her bat a single eye.Even though she did not have any profound qi, dealing with them was a such a simple task!How was this the cowardly, weak and gutless good-for-nothing Third Young Miss?Smiling, Huang Yue Li swept her eyes over the ground. Those who felt her gaze sweep past them felt their bodies turn cold. Their groans softening instantly.Huang Yue Li chuckled: \u201cHonestly, I know that you\u2019re merely obeying orders as a subordinate should. My Second Uncle sent you over, you dare not to disobey. This really cannot be blamed on you.\u201dEyes widening in disbelief, they didn\u2019t dare to believe what they were hearing. The Third Young Miss who was that cruel, would suddenly change her attitude and become this understanding.Unaffected, Huang Yue Li continued in a sweet voice: \u201cEveryone here is without freedom. I am not something who won\u2019t feel pity, so I will go with you to the Manor then!\u201dThey didn\u2019t dare to believe their eyes.Eyes brimming with tears, the commander said emotionally: \u201cThird\u2026\u2026Third Young Miss, you are really\u2026\u2026\u2026too good. A great person possesses a great heart. You truly are the Old Manor Lord\u2019s daughter. This subordinate\u2026\u2026this subordinate had offended you previously. I deserve to die ten thousand times, deserve to die ten thousand times!\u201dAs he said this, he began to give himself a few slaps.Just then, he was anxious as to how he would explain to the Manor Lod.Would he really have to say the truth. That his entire squad was easily dealt with by the Third Miss? Not only would this be extremely embarrassing, no one would believe such a thing ah!Furthermore, the Manor Lord had always treated servants harshly. If he was unable to complete such a simple task, he would really suffer!Who knew that the Third Young Miss would suddenly change her attitude and think about them. She clearly knew that the Manor Lord didn\u2019t have good intentions but still chose to go with them\u2026\u2026what type of conscious did she have? It was as great as a goddess!The little phoenix who was hiding within Huang Yue Li\u2019s shoulder, let out a few coughs in shock and slapped his wing.Ai, he really worried for the intelligence of those people. How could this female demon be this kind? If that happened, the sun would be rising from the west!As expected, Huang Yue Li quickly followed with: \u201cBut, you people have polluted the environment here, scared my poor maid and activated my secret mechanisms. These losses\u2026\u2026you must pay for them!\u201dStunned for a moment, the commander quickly recovered and answered: \u201cYes, yes, yes. This ought to be, ought to be! Third Young Miss is a great person with a great heart, this subordinate cannot thank you enough. Compensating you is something that should naturally be done\u2026\u2026\u201dCheep! Cheep!Another unlucky victim was born\u2026\u2026\u2026Scratching his ear, the little phoenix couldn\u2019t bear to watch this farce any longer. Tucking his head under his wing, he averted his attention.Huang Yue Li\u2019s smile was especially benevolent: \u201cLord Commander truly understands well! Good, good future prospects! This Miss just loves to speak with smart people like you! Since it is like this, I will give you a twenty percent discount. Each person pay out four hundred silvers and I will go with you!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Wha? How much?\u201d\u201cFour hundred silvers.

Why was it them who were paying the money, and so much at that??Raising her eyebrow, Huang Yue Li answered him: \u201cWhat? You are unconvinced? Take a closer look at my Eight Direction Earth Burrowing Thorns? Ah? Look carefully. Those are Second Level Middle Grade Armaments. It is also such a large scale Mechanism-type Armament. Priceless beyond compare! If you were to put them on the market, they would sell for at least ten thousand silvers!\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes bulged out, carefully observing the row of thorns.They all had the same thoughts: \u2018My god! This row of iron thorns was that amazing. They were Second Level Armaments ah! In my entire life, this is the first time that I get to see Second Level Armaments! They were actually lying on the ground like streaky pork skewers!\u2019Huang Yue Li continued: \u201cNow you know? This Armament, cost five thousand silvers to manufacture. This was all because I took pity on you and gave you a twenty percent discount, charging you each four hundred silvers. I am suffering a loss of one thousand silvers! As for the trauma you made my maid suffer, as the master I decided to write that off! Yet you still consider it expensive? Do you not feel guilty?\u201dThey were thoroughly lectured by her. Looking at their feet, they began to reflect on themselves.That\u2019s right, Third Young Miss is already this generous. Yet everyone continued to complain and haggle about the price, this was too appalling\u2026\u2026\u201cThird Young Miss this subordinate is not acknowledging his debt. In truth\u2026\u2026this subordinate did not bring that much money with him\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Third Young Miss, this sum is the accumulation of our wages for several years. It wouldn\u2019t be that easy to take out\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCorrect ah. Third Young Miss, I have a eighty year old mother and a child who still needs to drink milk. I truly cannot take such a sum out ah\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWith someone one leading the herd, the others followed him and started to cry out. All pretending to be pitiful!After all this was such a large sum of money. No matter how reasonable the Third Young Miss said, they were unwilling to part with that sum!For those with a working brain, they immediately went to find a loophole. Afterall, they didn\u2019t bring that much money with them today; even if they die, they wouldn\u2019t give it. What can the Third Young Miss possibly do then? She wouldn\u2019t possibly kill them?At the end of the day, they were guards of the Manor. If they were to die in the territory of the Third Young Miss, she would have provoked no small trouble!Gradually each and every one of the guards came to an understanding. Each crying out how poor they were, preparing to renege on their debts.Huang Yue Li sneered in her heart, while the smile on her face became filled with even more warmth and softness.\u201cOkay then, I know about everyone\u2019s sufferings. I am not someone who cannot be reasoned with. How about this, since everyone cannot take the sum out currently, why don\u2019t you all write an IOU. Leave the IOU at my residence. Take your time to gather the money and pay it off when you have acquired the sum.\u201dHearing those words, they became very energetic.\u201cSure sure sure. This solution is good! Just do it like that!\u201d\u201cThird Young Miss\u2019 heart truly is good and honest. You will definitely be rewarded well in the future!\u201d\u201cRest assured Third Young Miss.

Leaving those gates, who would go and admit it?The Third Young Miss did not know where they lived, so could not go to their doors knocking for their debts. This money\u2026\u2026\u2026naturally would not be returned!This Third Young Miss was this easily swindled, she even believed these types of promises.

Without a shred of hesitation, he wrote his words in large characters.As he wrote, he continuously praised: \u201cThird Young Miss\u2019 yours words are written so beautifully.

Lord Commander you are far too courteous!\u201dAs the IOU was passing through the hands of the guards, everyone seem to be very impatient to sign their names.

She satisfied, she smiled and said: \u201cToo good. Everyone here is honest and straightforward! Let\u2019s go with our agreement then. Take ten days to gather four hundred silvers each and send to this courtyard. Otherwise I will take a note to the Main Manor and let my Second Uncle see what you guys say behind his back\u201d\u201cHuh? What has this got to with the Manor Lord?\u201dFeeling that those words were a bit strange, he asked that question.Eyes narrowing from her smile, Huang Yue Li said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know before, but you people were actually this dissatisfied with the Manor Lord! You complain that he does not give you enough income and complaining how harshly he treats subordinates.

Allowing him a clearer view of the words.Taking a closer view of the note, they nearly spit out blood!How was this an IOU? This was a collective agreement signed by Wu Wei Manor\u2019s Personal Guard Regiment\u2019s, declaring the law bending of the Manor Master! It was full of Bai Liu Jing\u2019s dark deeds.

These things \u2026\u2026you cannot forgive things like these!Walking into the corridor that lead to the audience room, she could start to hear Bai Liu Jing\u2019s voice from a distance.\u201cWhat is going on? They have left for already an hour, but they have still not brought the person back? They are only there to capture a good-for-nothing girl. Do they need that much time?\u201dThe Manor Madam consoled in a soft voice: \u201cLord, do not blame the guards. It may be that the girl Bai Ruo Li refuses to come, delaying for time. You may not know this, but lately she has grown some courage. Not only does she dare to have secret relationships with others, she also dares to hit her own elder sister! I heard others say that even the fourth girl has been hit by her\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? There was also this kind of thing?? She is overturning the heavens!\u201dBai Ruo Qi also sobbingly added: \u201cFather, you must seek justice for your daughter. Your daughter was hit quite miserably by her ah! \u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHehe\u2026\u2026\u201d An extremely light sounding chuckled rang out cutting off her lamentations.\u201cSecond Sister, what do you mean by that ah? Did I hit you? You must take responsibility for your words. When did I raise my hand to you?\u201dEveryone present in the reception hall turned their heads.They all watched as a young girl dressed in a billowing white dress slowly walked in. Her movements were graceful and she carried a dignified and elegant charisma about her, like an immortal fairy who had cut herself off from the secular world. Cold yet noble.Startled, Bai Liu Jing blurted: You are\u2026\u2026\u201cFor a moment, he couldn\u2019t recognise who she was!Huang Yue Li smilingly asked: \u201cSecond Uncle, you cannot recognise me after not meeting for a few days?\u201d\u201cYou are Bai Ruo Li?? How can that be?\u201d Bai Liu Jing cried out in surprise.These years, under his deliberate suppression Bai Ruo Li had become a complete trash. So much that she could not even raise her head in public with dignity.Everytime she left home, her head would be lowered to her chest, not daring to raise her voice. Even her clothes were not extravagant and could not even measure up to a maid\u2019s from an influential family! She had long become a laughstock at every noble gathering!But the young lady standing in front of him now possessed an air that was out of the ordinary. Every move and motion of hers displayed an unspeakable and automatic placing of someone from a grand and noble family. I made people want to pay their respects to her willingly.What she still that trash Bai Ruo Li?But after a careful observation, the five facial features were undoubtedly the same.After a long time of distraction, Bai Liu Jing finally regained himself.Meeting her enemy, Bai Ruo Qi\u2019s eyes reddened as she mockingly laughed out loud: \u201cBai Ruo Li! You have finally come! You dare to harm into this state and still dare to come here. Let\u2019s see how my father will deal with you!\u201dScratching her ear, Huang Yue Li chuckled in a low voice: \u201cWhy do I not dare to come? Wasn\u2019t Second Uncle who invited me here? Furthermore, who are you? I think I do not recognise you?\u201d\u201cBai Ruo Li, what garlic sprout are you?!\u201dEyebrows creased, Bai Liu Jing spoke in a stern voice: \u201cBai Ruo Li, how do you speak to your paternal older cousin? Sorely lacking in manners! No wonder you can beat up your older cousin to this degree! Hurry up and apologise your you Second Sister!\u201dAt a loss, Huang Yue Li\u2019s gaze swept over Bai Ruo Qi. Following that, in a very exaggerated motion she placed her hands over her mouth.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u2026You can not possibly be telling me that, this pig-head is my Second Sister? How can this be? You must have made a mistake. My Second Sister is a renowned icy beauty in the country of South Yue. With countless young and powerful young men are kneeling under her dress. How can this stinking girl be her?\u201dWith her mention of \u2018pig-head\u2019 and another of \u2018stinking girl\u2019 were like piercing daggers. They struck straight into Bai Ruo Qi\u2019s heart.Bai Ruo Qi was graced with good looks from birth. When had she ever suffered such a humiliation before?This was all harmed by Huang Yue Li!

That she must maintain her virtuous and refined lady facade.Fiercely she glared at Huang Yue Li before turning to Bai Liu Jing, tearfully: \u201cDaddy, you must seek justice for your daughter ah!\u201dBai Liu Jing saw that the moment Huang Yue Li stepped into the hall, she did not put him, her Second Uncle in her eyes. He was long angered by this.Now watching as his most beloved daughter with such a swollen face, suffering from such wrongdoing he angrily slammed his hand on the table. The teacup and saucer were swept off the table and shattered onto the ground.\u201cHuang Yue Li, kneel down for me!\u201dSeverely Bai Liu Jing ordered.If it were the previous her, Bai Ruo Li\u2019s would have long caused her legs to soften in fear from his attitude, kneeling on the floor.Unfortunately in the eyes of Huang Yue Li, this scene was far too amusing.Laughing softly, she shook her head and said: \u201cSecond Uncle, are you speaking to me?\u201dBai Liu Jing furiously replied: \u201cIf I am not talking to you, who am I talking to? Hurry up and kneel down! Is this the proper manner for you to speak to an elder?\u201dCalmly and tranquilly, Huang Yue Li replied: \u201cSecond Uncle, you are saying I do not understand proper etiquette? I\u2019m afraid the one who is unclear about the situation is you? I am Region Princess whose title was personally bestowed by the Emperor. If we are to talk about status, I hold a higher title than you, a Marquis. It should be you who should be greeting me, no?\u201d\u201cPreposterous!\u201dBai Liu Jing did not expect Huang Yue Li to refuse. Stunned momentarily, his face turned ashen as he retorted: \u201cI am your elder! If I want you to kneel, then kneel! You dare to twist words and force logic?\u201d\u201cElder? I guess so. Second Uncle, as my elder you forcibly possessed the assets left behind by my mother and father for yourself. Such a kind-hearted elder, if others were to hear of this, they would most likely praise Second Uncle. They would say that you are someone who possesses good sentients and a good sense of justice right?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dBai Liu Jing was at a loss for words.He did not imagine that Huang Yue Li would suddenly the mention the topic of family property! This matter was a guilty conscience of his. Many years have passed and Bai Ruo Li had never mentioned the matter!The reason why he could take possession of the assets left behind by Bai Liu Feng was due Bai Ruo Li\u2019s young age and naiveness. He could bully her and forcibly take it away.Later on, though she grew up, she suffered tremendously under the combined bullying of those in the Manor becoming cowardly and timid. Adding on the fact that she was good-for-nothing, no one put her words to heart. As time went on, she no longer dared to go against Bai Liu Jing.What was with this girl?Today, not only did her entire temperament change, every single one of her words hit a key point!Ignoring the deathly gazes, Huang Yue Li went to find a chair to sit down on and poured herself a cup of tea.Smilingly she spoke up: \u201cSpeaking of which, as a Region Princess I can entire the Royal Palace at any time. When I was young, the Emperor and Empress Dowager would treat me quite well. So many years have passed since I last paid my respects. This is a bit unacceptable. I think I should find some time to enter the Royal Palace to visit my senior the Empress Dowager and inform her of how I have been spending my days\u2026\u201dWhen those words left her mouth, Bai Liu Jing\u2019s heart jumped.The matter of him suppressing Bai Ruo Li was naturally hidden from the Royal Palace.The year that Bai Liu Feng became the number one expert in South Yue, was not only because of his numerous and brilliant military conquests. But because he had saved the Emperor\u2019s life, numerous times!Even though he had disappeared, the Emperor was someone who cherished old relationships and gave hundreds of benefits and leeways these years for the Manor. These were all because of friendship between him and Bai Liu Jing.If the Royal Palace were to be informed that he had constantly been mistreating Bai Liu Jing\u2019s only daughter these past years, he could possibly be angering the dragon!You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Naturally they stopped looking for her.Because Bai Ruo Li suffered so much under the hands of the Manor, it caused her to neglect the fact that she could enter the Royal Palace.Due to this fact, Bai Liu Jing was deathly afraid if she wanted to enter the Royal Palace. Hearing this, his attitude immediately softened.\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u2026Li\u2019er ah, look at what you are saying\u2026\u2026it\u2019s like you are accusing your Second Uncle of mistreatment?

You must at least give a proper explanation for all of this?\u201dRaising the teacup, Huang Yue Li took a small sip before responding: \u201cSecond Uncle, your words are amusing. Who doesn\u2019t know I am complete trash at cultivating! Second Sister is at the Seventh Level of the Qi Profound Realm, how could I possibly injure her? Isn\u2019t this too funny?\u201dBai Liu Jing thought for a moment and realised this was the case.He turned his gaze towards Bai Ruo Qi, and asked her in a doubtful tone: \u201cQi\u2019er, what is going on?\u201dBai Ruo Qi assumed that Huang Yue Li would receive a severe humiliation today. She did not think that a few words from her would impede Bai Liu Jing\u2019s advance.Unfortunately her mind worked fast and she quickly replied in a pitiful tone: \u201cDaddy, don\u2019t listen to her nonsense. Your daughter was hurt by her! I don\u2019t know what demonic tricks she used. But before I knew what was happening, I was struck to the floor by her, unable to move! She definitely has learnt some demonic technique!\u201d\u201cDemonic techniques?\u201d Bai Liu Jing wrinkled his brows.Of course he would believe his most beloved and pampered second daughter, but regarding demonic techniques, it sounded a bit unbelievable.Never had he heard of a method that allowed trash to defeat an expert at the Seventh Level of the Qi Profound Realm!Seeing that he did not believe, Bai Ruo Qi hastily added: \u201cDaddy, what I said was the truth! Not only was I a victim to Bai Ruo Li, Fourth Sister was also abused by her!\u201d\u201cYan\u2019er? What happened to her?\u201d\u201cA few days ago Fourth Sister went to visit Third Sister, but she fell victim to her bewitching. She actually took off all her clothes and started to run around the wide street naked!\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201dBai Liu Jing was greatly surprised by that piece of news and stood up in alarm.\u201cWhat is going on? Explain it clearly for me!\u201dCautiously and carefully, Bai Ruo Qi gave a few sides glances as she retold the rumors surrounding Bai Ruo Yan. She did not forget to add oil to the fire and exaggerate things.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026That day, there were many people at our Back Manor door.

That girl actually dared to do such an embarrassing things! No wonder the gazes of the other ministers were strange whenever I entered the Royal Court! Turns out they were laughing at me and my daughter who lacks upbringing!\u201dIn a timely manner, Bai Ruo Qi continued to add: \u201cDaddy, please quell your anger. Don\u2019t let such things anger you! Precisely because Qi\u2019er was afraid that this would anger you, so I did not dare to tell you. I wanted to secretly asked Third Sister about it, but who knew I would fall under her tricks\u2026\u2026\u201dFinishing, she made eye contact with the Second Madam.Quick-witted the Manor Madam was.

The Manor Madam had found quite unpleasing to the eye for quite some time. But Bai Ruo Yan possessed decent cultivation talent with a decent appearance. One could not be sure that she wouldn\u2019t catch the Crown Prince\u2019s eye, becoming a rival of Bai Ruo Qi\u2019sTaking the opportunity while the Manor Lord was angered, she brought that out. Not only would that give Bai Ruo Yan a bad outlook, it would also transfer onto her maternal aunt.Tsk tsk, this was just too brilliant! This was a web of plans!Howener, Huang Yue Li held no thoughts of stopping them.It wasn\u2019t like Bai Ruo Yan was innocent, not bullying her.

Pass my words to Concubine Guo telling to properly discipline her daughter!

She didn\u2019t think they would only be confined\u2026\u2026\u2026On the other hand, the Manor Madam did not show any reaction nor emotion. Instead she said: \u201cLord, calm your anger!

On the surface she portrayed an appearance of self-criticism and blame, while inside she worried that Bai Liu Jing was not angered enough. She mentioned both topics again, while also pushing herself into the mix!When those two embarrassing things were placed together, if Bai Liu Jing wasn\u2019t furious then it would be strange!As expected, Bai Liu Jing immediately changed his mind. He directly went and called for the leader and instructed: \u201cGo send for people to prepare the carriage. Directly escort the Fourth Young Miss to the farmstead! Without my command, she is not to return!\u201dA ray of satisfaction passed through the Manor Madam\u2019s eyes, but she quickly hid this.Though she did not eliminate Concubine Guo, that little slut was sent away.

At least\u2026\u2026\u2026she should be forbidden to leave the house.At the feast where the Crown Princes chooses his Imperial Concubine, this Third Girl was the biggest obstacle and rival for Bai Ruo Qi. Afterall, she and the Crown Prince held a verbal agreement for their engagement since their youth.This was especially concerning today, as she had changed completely. Such an elegant and refined temperament, even the simple raising of her hand portrayed someone of high birth.This set of many alarms ringing within the Manor Madam\u2019s heart.She would not allow this girl to be such a obstacle in her daughter\u2019s fortuitous event!But Bai Liu Jin was a bit hesitant: \u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201dWithout a doubt, he wanted to drive Huang Yue Li away.

Uncle was\u2026\u2026Third Sister had no one to educate her, so she does not know where she made such a mistake!

Obviously, that was impossible.The more likely probability was she had used some high levelled Profound Skill.But how could this girl possess such a precious thing? It was definitely something left behind by Bai Liu Feng!Ever since the disappearance of Bai Liu Feng, Bai Liu Jing had interrogated Bai Ruo Li numerous times. He wished to find all the pills and Armaments left behind by Bai Liu Feng, but failed to find any clues.It didn\u2019t seem like Bai Ruo Li had lied to him. Her personality was cowardly and weak, so Bai Liu Jing could only give up.But it was different now. The reasons why this girl could become this strong and courageous could possibly be\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026she found Bai Liu Feng\u2019s legacy?Coming to this conclusion, Bai Liu Jing\u2019s gaze changed.If she really had the things left behind by Bai Liu Feng within her grasp, he must obtain them at any cost!He must make this his priority, taking advantage of the current situation. He must first drive her away from the back courtyard and then slowly search around. One by one, he will uncover all the things left behind by Bai Liu Feng!Putting on a bemoaning expression, he sighed out: \u201cAi Qi\u2019er, what you say is correct!

It was like a gaze of an powerful person, not allowing others to look at them directly\u2026\u2026\u2026He must have made a mistake.Composing himself, Bai Liu Jing continued to display his most amicable smile: \u201cLi\u2019er ah, do misunderstand. Second Uncle doesn\u2019t have any intention of blaming you! It\u2019s just the day that you were meeting with that man, there were just too many witnesses\u2026\u2026\u2026if rumors were to spread, you will no longer be able to maintain your integrity anymore. Second Uncle is doing this for your own good. Stay in the farmstead for a while and wait for the heat to die down before coming back!\u201dSmiling, Huang Yue Li replied: \u201cIs that so? However people say that only girls who committed mistakes would be sent to the farmstead. Second Uncle\u2026\u2026could it be that you dislike your niece of yours?\u201dHastily Bai Liu Jing smiled: \u201cHow can that be? Li\u2019er, you over-thought this!\u201dThough his words his said this, he thought differently. What he more than anything was to get rid of this girl as soon as possible.But now this girl had become smarter, so he could not do things like he used to. To prevent her from speaking carelessly, he could only reply on good words and compliments to cheat her away.The Manor Madam chimed in: \u201cThat\u2019s right. Li\u2019er, your Second Uncle is your closest relative. How could he harm you? Since you are young in age, you do not know of the full consequences this scandal can cause for a young girl like you! This is all for your future!\u201dEven Bai Ruo Qi spoke: \u201cThird Sister, father and mother are with good intentions.

And why are you searching for it?\u201dHands shaking, Bai Liu Jing immediately directed a seething glare towards the Manor Madam and Bai Ruo Qi!The key that Huang Yue Li was referring to, naturally was the key to Bai Liu Feng\u2019s treasure trove!His older brother the most powerful man in South Yue, had collected countless treasures. He had heard that there were even Sixth Level Pills and Armaments!The key to these treasure should logically have been be left with Bai Ruo Li. Unfortunately she did not have knowledge.Bai Liu Jing naturally coveted this key. But he afraid to alert his niece, causing her to open the safe first. So every time he mentioned the topic, he would be very careful and probe around in the dark.He did not expect that Bai Ruo Qi would leak this out and alerted Huang Yue Li of this affair!She really couldn\u2019t do anything right! Failing miserably!If they were unable to obtain Bai Liu Feng\u2019s inheritance, then the blame would be all on those two women!Currently, Bai Ruo Qi was full of embarrassment.

Please do not wrong me!\u201dDuring her little explanation, Bai Ruo Qi was bloodily cursing at Bai Ruo Yan.Asking her to complete such a little thing and she wasn\u2019t able to. Furthermore, she leaked the news of the key outside!Now that their father knows, who knows how angry he will become! Really dragged down by her!Huang Yue Li said: \u201cThen I must have misheard that day! Since it is like this, then Second Sister you must acknowledge you have wronged me? The matter of the Fourth Sister running around naked was the result of her own sickness. Unrelated to me in any way?

But you secretly meeting with men outside is not correct. You are still a conferred Region Princess. If news of this were to spread out, even the Emperor himself would lose face! Worst case, he might strip you of your title!\u201dHuang Yue Li\u2019s thought this was laughable, lips curving.Want to use the Emperor to scare her? This Second Uncle of hers is really short sighted.In her previous life, even the Lord of the South Sky Region would treat her with extreme deference. Say nothing of a measly South Yue, who was but a tiny country in the South Sky Region?This so-called Emperor, she did not put him her eyes.Purposefully she smiled: \u201cMany thanks for Second Uncle\u2019s reminder! Since you are not searching for anything, there is no need for me to move! The Manor\u2019s Back Courtyard is where I grew up. If I were to move and unable to accustom myself, I might might say the wrong things. There is also the possibility I might secretly come back. If this were to be misunderstood by others that Second Uncle was treating me badly, how bad that would be!\u201dHearing those words, Bai Liu Jing\u2019s face turned steaming red from anger!This damn girl really was not the same!If it were the previous her, she would have long been scared speechless and obediently complied.But now, she clearly saw through all his motives and was evidently threatening him.If he were to forcibly drive her away, this girl would go around spreading malicious rumors. Ruining the name of the Manor.And if those rumors were to reach the Emperor\u2019s ears\u2026\u2026\u2026Biting his teeth, Bai Liu Jing replied: \u201cGood! You are old now and your wings have hardened. Your Second Uncle can no longer control you! Since you do not want to take shelter from the wind, you cannot blame your Second Uncle if you cannot be married off!\u201d\u201cThen I won\u2019t trouble Second Uncle for his worry. Afterall, I am someone who has a verbal engagement with the Crown Prince. Who knows, I may wed into the Royal Family and become the Crown Prince\u2019s Imperial Concubine?\u201d Huang Yue Li lightly replied.Just as she finished her words, Bai Ruo Qi uncontrollably cried out.\u201cYou sure dream well! On what basis\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026want to become the Crown Prince\u2019s Imperial Concubine?\u201dCalmly, Huang Yue Li answered her: \u201cWhy can\u2019t I? My father was a famous and the strongest person in South Yue. While I am a Region Princess whose title was personally conferred by the Emperor! Even when I was young, the Emperor mentioned marriage between the Crown Prince and I! If I cannot become the Crown Prince\u2019s Imperial Concubine, who can? Could it be you, Second Sister?\u201d\u201cYou! Don\u2019t always think about the past! The current master of Wu Wei Manor is my father! Also, do you think that the Emperor will allow the Crown Prince to choose someone whose is a cultivation trash as his Imperial Concubine? The Crown Prince is a mighty Fifth Grade Talent, who would definitely need to choose a female of similar talent as he is to match him. A trash like you\u2026\u2026\u2026don\u2019t think about soaring your entire life!\u201d\u201cLooks like Second Sister has some intention towards the position of Imperial Concubine\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026determined to win!\u201d\u201cOh, of course! Apart from me, who else can match with the Crown Prince?\u201d\u201cQi\u2019er!\u201d Interrupting them, the Manor Madam cried out, \u201cDon\u2019t speak anymore!\u201dStartled, Bai Ruo Qi finally reacted. Under the provocation of Huang Yue Li, she had said all the things which had kept secretly within her!If those were words were to be heard by those within the Royal Palace, it would be great disrespect!Hastily she shut her mouth. Clamping down hard, she glared hatefully at Huang Yue Li.Presently, Huang Yue Li confirmed the motive behind this mother-daughter pair\u2019s accusation of her of illicit relationship. It was all due to the position of Imperial Concubine.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Placing the teacup down, she stood up.\u201cSecond Uncle, the time is no longer early so I will first return! But I still have a task to trouble you with.\u201dFinishing, Huang Yue Li took out a piece of paper that was filled with small words.Knitting his eyebrows together, Bai Liu Jing asked: \u201cWhat is this?\u201dPronouncing each word clearly, Huang Yue Li replied: \u201cThis is list of my father\u2019s private properties and items in my mother\u2019s dowry. I will trouble Second Uncle to look over it.\u201d\u201cWhat is your intention?\u201d Bai Liu Jing\u2019s facial expression shifted.Smilingly, Huang Yue Li said: \u201cSecond Uncle, since I was young in age, I asked you to look after the estates and properties that my mother and father left behind for me. But my heart would not me feel to feel at peace. How can I continue to trouble you? Now that I am older, if I were to allow Second Uncle to work hard like this, people will say that I am unfilial!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHe did not expect that today\u2019s visit of Huang Yue Li was for this. She even prepared a written list, waiting to meet him!He was leading a wolf into the home!Though her words were nice to listen to. The sarcasm that mocked him for bullying his niece due to her young age to possess her property was heard very clearly.If he was not willingly to return it, was she prepared to cause a large fuss?With great difficulty, Bai Liu Jing steadied his emotions and said: \u201cLi\u2019er ah, your intention, Second Uncle understands. But this is not something that can be done in one or two days. I must take time to calculate everything clearly and accurately before handing everything back to you. What do you say?\u201dVery quickly he decided to stall for time. He will first stabilise his position with this girl, before slowly refuse to admit anything.Afterall, she was just a girl who had yet to experience society. The management of the properties was not an easy task, she would understand anything. When the time came, he would transfer all the money away and send her an empty statement. She wouldn\u2019t be able to find a way out!Huang Yue Li long expected he would say this. Smiling, she didn\u2019t refute his words.\u201cSince it\u2019s like this, then do not worry about any changes. I ask that Second Uncle send a compiled list of all the properties to my Back Courtyard within three days.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u2026don\u2019t be so hasty. The storehouse needs to make in inventory of all the treasures and the like\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dSmiling: \u201cSecond Uncle, I forgot to tell you. The items listed on the list were all bestowed by the Royal Palace. If the Empress were to ask me of the those bestowed items when I enter the Royal Palace in a few days, I would be committing a grave sin if any were to be missing! Second Uncle, you wouldn\u2019t dig such a pit for me?\u201dBai Liu Jing was stunned for quite awhile.Forcibly possessing items bestowed by the Palace would definitely result in conviction from the Emperor. He could only return that portion to her.But the things that Bai Liu Feng left behind, how was he to know which ones were Palace bestowed and which wasn\u2019t? Didn\u2019t he still have rely on Huang Yue Li\u2019s word?If she said they all were, he wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference!But what if the few items he did not return were the bestowed items, wouldn\u2019t he be leaving a handle for her to grab onto?And coincidentally, all the things that Huang Yue Li listed were priceless and invaluable. Forcing him to give them up so easily, really made him want to spit blood! The pain was equivalent to slicing his flesh away!Bai Liu Jing forced out a smile: \u201cOkay, Second Uncle will do his best to sort things out and send it over for you!\u201d\u201cI shall give my thanks first Second Uncle!\u201dCompleting her objective, Huang Yue Li waved her hands and walked out.

With a loud \u2018pa\u2019, he gave Bai Ruo Qi a slap.\u201cFather! You\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dClutching her cheek, Bai Ruo Qi could not react.She was the most favoured daughter of Bai Liu Jing. She had never been hit by him before.Who would have imagined that Bai Liu Jing would take his anger on her. Furthermore, he did not offer an explanation before landing that slap.Bai Liu Jing was immensely angered by Huang Yue Li, but had no method to release it. When he turned around and saw that pig-headed daughter of his, he slapped her in a fit of anger.In the past, the more he saw the more he liked her. But now, just looking at her made him disgusted.\u201cIt\u2019s all because of you! If it weren\u2019t because of your loose mouth with Yan\u2019er, how would she be able to alert that damn girl of the key? Now that she become this powerful should all be because of Elder Brother\u2019s inheritance!\u201dEven in his dreams, Bai Liu Jing dreamed of obtaining those treasures. He had been stuck in the Ninth Level of the Defensive Profound Realm for many years already. He was hoping to find a pill within those treasures and hopefully be promoted to the Spirit Profound Realm!With that increase, he would become on the of the powerhouses in South Yue. He would no longer need to spend his days in fear over the happiness and moods of the Emperor.He didn\u2019t expect that Bai Ruo Qi would leak the news out. Halting his grand plans!Not to mention how many properties and treasures Huang Yue Li had asked him to return! Such heavy losses!If it weren\u2019t for the fact that Bai Ruo Qi could not reconcile with Huang Yue Li, how could be possibly be blackmailed by that girl?Prostrating tearfully, Bai Ruo Qi said: \u201cFather, this truly was not daughter\u2019s fault. It was all due to Fourth Sister\u2019s loose tongue, she definitely heard of the conversation between mother and I! It\u2019s all her fault!\u201dThe burning flames of anger, burned even more ferociously within Bai Ruo Qi\u2019s heart!It\u2019s all because of Bai Ruo Li, that cheap slut!She was clearly a wastrel, yet beat her to such an ugly appearance! She also dreamed of becoming the Crown Prince\u2019s Imperial Concubine!If Bai Ruo Li were to end up in her hands, she would suffer a fate worse than death!\u2026\u2026At the Manor entranceBai Ruo Yan was currently in the midst of an argument with the Manor Madam\u2019s confidante, Mama Liu.\u201cMove aside for me! I want to see my father! I don\u2019t believe that my father would drive me away from the Manor! There is definitely someone working from the shadows. Let me see my father, so I can explain everything to him!\u201dPutting in a false smile, Mama Liu said: \u201cFourth Young Miss, the Master already said he no longer wants to see you again. Why don\u2019t you obediently go to the farmstead and not lose anymore face for the Manor!\u201d\u201cNot possible! How can my father not want to see me? Then I want to see Second Sister! Second Sister will definitely help me!\u201dJust was Huang Yue Li was leaving, she happened to see the exchange between to the two parties. Watching this, she smiled from amusement.Looking at her blankly, it took Bai Ruo Yan sometime before she recognised that person.Soon afterwards, she stormed over. In a fit of anger, she raised her hand and slapped towards Huang Yue Li!\u201cLittle slut! It\u2019s all your fault! What demonic technique did you use on me, making me act like that? Now you are pleased? I\u2019ll beat you to death!\u201dWith a light move her foot, she kicked a stone right under Bai Ruo Yan\u2019s foot.Stepping on the stone, Bai Ruo Yan lost her equilibrium and fell heavily onto the floor.Furthermore, she landed in a sprawled position!Giggling, Huang Yue Li said: \u201cAi, Fourth Younger Sister I know that you feel very grateful towards me.

Suddenly she felt her nose turn cold.Feeling her nose, she was startled to see that her nose had started to bleed. Coupled with her dust covered clothes, what part of her seemed like a high society lady. She seemed worse than a beggar.\u201cBai Ruo Li, you\u2019re looking for death!\u201dHearing the jeers of the passer-bys, Bai Ruo Yan was flustered and exasperated!\u201cYou harmed me like this and still have the mood to be sarcastic?

To tell you the truth, the reason behind your expelling was because of her instigating to Second Uncle today.\u201dBai Ruo Yan coldly laughed, \u201cIt seems you are the one trying to sow disharmony between us! I am on very good terms with Second Sister, she looks after me in many areas! It was definitely you who said bad things about me to my father. You want to place the blame on Second Sister\u2019s head? You think I would believe you?\u201d\u201cOh? You think it was me? Do you think that your father would believe me if I were to say those things to him? He believed one word from me and drove you out of the Manor? It\u2019s very clear the one who badmouthed you was someone your father trusts very much. That\u2019s why you so justly driven away!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. It\u2019s not possible\u2026\u2026\u2026you must be lying to me!\u201d\u201cSpeaking bluntly, Second Sister is just using you!

Bai Ruo Yan\u2019s mind believed it, her heart was not so ready to believe her.Sighing out, \u201cIt\u2019s up to you whether you believe me or not! Tsk, tsk. Being used, yet you are still counting money for them!\u201dNot speaking anymore, she left.Turning around the corner, Huang Yue Li glanced back. What she was Bai Ruo Yan staring at the Manor\u2019s gates with an expression of poisonous blame.Her lips curved up.Looked like from that moment onwards, those two sisters would become enemies.One was treacherous, the other malicious. Those two people, who would be the final victor?\u2026\u2026By the time Huang Yue Li returned to her Back Courtyard, the sky had already darkened.Cai Wei was anxiously running around in circles as she waited. Only when she saw Huang Yue Li step through the doors, did she release a sigh of relief.\u201cYoung Miss, you have finally returned! This servant was worried to death for you!\u201d\u201cRelax, your Miss is fine! Quickly go and rest!\u201dDismissing Cai Wei, Huang Yue Li walked straight to her bedroom.As soon as she pushed open the doors, she sensed something was off.Within the air was a thin thread of danger; incompatible with the room\u2019s atmosphere.Unconsciously she took out a flying needle. Using a deadly technique, she threw it!This flying needle was also an uncommon type of Profound Weapon. Under her refinement, its killing power was no less than a blades. And due to its small size, it was very hard to sense.Even Defensive Profound experts would be hard pressed to defend against this attack once she released it!However, the moment the needle flew away, Huang Yue Li felt an immense suction force towards her.The opponent\u2019s power was far too great. She could not resist as her wrists were grabbed, throwing her straight onto the bed!You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The suffocating pressure nearly caused Huang Yue Li to be unable to breathe.The hot air engulfed her, while warm fingers went straight to her neck. Straight afterwards, they captured her chin and forced her to look up.Because Huang Yue Li was thrown on to the bed, it took her a moment to regain herself. When she did, another needle flew out with a flick of her fingers.The body of the man pressing her down shifted and dodged the incoming needle.Taking the chance, Huang Yue Li\u2019s ten fingers were like lightning as they lashed out!As fast as she was, the man moved even faster.Moving easily to the side, he effortlessly avoided Huang Yue Li\u2019s attack. Grabbing onto her wrists, he lightly smiled: \u201cYou attacks are so deadly. If my cultivation was a bit poor, then I would have been injured by you!\u201dThat voice was a sexy and husky sound, and sounded very familiar.Stunned, Huang Yue Li raised her head to look at him.With the moonlight peeking in from the open window, the man\u2019s perfectly chiseled jawlines was revealed, not a single flaw to be seen. The silver mask on his face reflected the cold moonlight. This caused others to be unable to look at him clearly.\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201d Huang Yue Li\u2019s brows knitted together.Pointing out a finger, he shook it.\u2018Pu\u2019 it lightly sounded.A small flame shoot towards the oil lamp on the table. Instantly lighting up the room.The man\u2019s masked face also became much clearer.Was he reclined to the side the side of bed, his golden robes had opened slightly. This revealed a small amount of his jade skin chest, chiseled and enticing.Huang Yue Li\u2019s gaze landed on his body. However, her expression did not change in the slightest. She said in a detached voice: \u201cLord Owner, this is my room. It doesn\u2019t seem to be a place where you should appear?\u201d\u201cYoung Miss Bai\u2019s indifference really breaks my heart! This Lord had rushed here to personally inform you of the auction\u2019s news.

On the contrary, it was the man\u2019s expression that became exceptionally terrible looking!His words carried such a coquettish tone and easily inverted black into white.It was clearly the man\u2019s fault for trespassing into a young lady\u2019s room during the night. Not matter how you looked at it, she was performing justable self-defense. How did it become her fault?Furthermore, while the man spoke his hands firmly tied down Huang Yue Li\u2019s wrists. His fingers were also freely rubbing her tender palms.This move was one that invoked deep and tender emotion, causing a her to feel an itch within her. Though she wanted to resist, the disparity between their power did not allow her to.(Note: As Captain Jack Sparrow says, it\u2019s the uncontrollable itch~)Narrowing her eyes, she opened her mouth.\u201cLord Owner, the small task of passing on auction information can be left to one of the auction hands. I really do dare to trouble you Lord!\u201d\u201cThird Young Miss is too courteous. Afterall, you are a Third Tier Armament Master.

He had trespassed into her bedroom during the middle of the night. It painted a picture of a suspicious and scandalous scene.If she were to swap with her previous self, that girl would have long started to cry for her mother infront of such a lecher. Teaching her why flowers were so red!But now that the tiger was out and but with no resistance possibility, she could only pretend to comply.With that man\u2019s cultivation, it enabled him to walked horizontally in South Yue. Any kind of beauty that he wished for, he would be able to obtain.But her current appearance, really couldn\u2019t be counted as any beauty.Unless this man\u2019s tastes were that special, liking the young ones. Otherwise\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026he was just bored and wanted to play with her.With great difficulty, Huang Yue Li suppressed her anger and said in a level voice: \u201cSince it is like this, I ask the Lord Owner to say your important news.

How can you say that you are wasting my time? This is what this Lord wants.\u201dHis grin was unrestrained and fully presented his kingly charisma for all to see. Only those at the very top with were gifted with such an aura!Instantly the temperature within the room plummeted. That icy coldness was stifling like an innate essence, infiltrating every corner of the room.Though his face was covered by a mask, Huang Yue Li was still able to sense his scrutinising gaze. Steadily, his gaze travelled from the top of her head to the bottom of her feet.It was like\u2026\u2026\u2026she had become of his possessions in his grasp.While Huang Yue Li revealed a smiling expression, she was secretly cursing the man inside her heart: \u201cLord Owner you are too polite. But currently I am ready to rest\u2026\u2026\u201dThe man\u2019s profound gaze wavered a bit, this was unexpected.The reason why he did not withdraw his pressure was in hopes of scaring this girl. That would allow her to realise the the gap in her abilities and make her attitude soften.With his cultivation and status, how many powerful experts could withstand his pressure. Each one of them, when faced with his gaze could only bow down their heads.Yet this girl seemed to wholly unaffected\u2026\u2026\u2026As the man\u2019s gaze landed on the bed behind her, his smile turned somewhat ambiguous: \u201cResting so early? How about this Lord rests with you on the bed and we\u2019ll talk in the morning?\u201dHuang Yue Li\u2019s expression finally cracked!\u201cLord Owner, honest people do not say obscured words. Why do you need to play with me? Why don\u2019t you state your aim openly!

Very good. Extremely good!Standing up, her finger pointed towards the door. With a smile that wasn\u2019t quite a smile, she said: \u201cSince it is like this, why did you come? My back courtyard is very lacking and poor. I expect that it also won\u2019t amount to much in your eyes?\u201dRaising her chin, her tone was frosty while her eyes burned with anger. But it was because of this that astonished people.Staring into that pair of brilliantly coloured eyes, the man felt bewitched by them.He constantly felt that gaze was oh so familiar. Like he had been bewitched by those eyes, many years ago. Lost by her crafty and enticing smile.Henceforth, he yearned it even in his dreams.Even crossing the jade bridge of the yellow river, he would not be able to escape\u2026\u2026But clearly his first meeting with this girl was only a couple days ago.As the the man was distracted, his gaze towards Huang Yue Li turned even more profound.On the other hand, Huang Yue Li became further enraged by his staring.What was hidden within that lecherous gaze? Seeing this man\u2019s posing, could he really be a bit of a pervert??After quite some time did the man regain himself. His eyes travelling over her taut face, his mouth hooked.\u201cIt seems that you are really unwelcoming of this Lord?\u201dHuang Yue Li chuckled in response, \u201cIf the Lord Owner did not burst into my room during the night, humming and speaking unintelligent drivels, I would be quite welcoming.\u201dLazily, he replied: \u201cHow can you blame this Lord? It is you who does not the proper etiquette of treating guests. It has been quite some time since this Lord arrived, yet you have yet to even pour a single cup of tea. How do you expect this Lord to inform you of the news?\u201dHuang Yue Li said: \u201cThat is simple. Cai Wei\u2026\u2026\u201dRaising her voice, she wished to ask Cai Wei to go brew a pot of tea.Before the words could leave her lips, a warm and white as jade finger landed on her lips, silencing them.Leaning forward, the man closed in and smirked: \u201cWhy are you calling the maid? This Lord\u2026\u2026\u2026wants to drink tea you brewed.\u201dThe dominating smell of a man assaulted her nose. His clear lips where in such proximity of her face, that a single incline of his face and they would kiss.Instantly, Huang Yue Li cheeks were dyed red. Her breathing irregular.Slapping the man\u2019s hands away: \u201cBrewing tea the is fine, why was there is need for you to move your hands? But I must tell you, I only have cold water here. If you want to drink tea, you can only drink cold tea.\u201dIf not for the fact that she still needed to rely on him to increase her cultivation, she\u2026\u2026\u2026endured!But this debt she will remember. Sooner or later she will return it to him!Watching her fake composure, he already guessed his thoughts.But he had nothing to worry about. This little fox was destined to never leave his palms.If in the future they are together and this little wanted to stretch her claws from boredom, he wouldn\u2019t mind playing with her. Making his Imperial Concubine smile was worthwhile.Following Huang Yue Li\u2019s hand movements, he leaned back to say: \u201cIs there a problem?\u201dEyes twinkling, the slender and boney hands landed on the the teapot lid. Soon after, hot steam began to rise from the spout.It was clear to see that the water within had turned into boiling water.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Once done, she pushed the cup towards him.\u201cFor you, to drink!\u201d She said in an ill tone.He didn\u2019t take up the cup. Raising his eyebrows, he questioned: \u201cWhat? This is the attitude that you give to guests? Speaking in such a rude tone, to outsiders it would seemed like you have some sort of grudge with this Lord!\u201dEating so many benefits from her, how would she not a grudge?Rolling her eyes are him, Huang Yue Li saw the the frivolous curve on his face. She couldn\u2019t help but want to give him a big slap!But the man saw through her intentions, his gaze carrying traces of ridicule. Though his body was relaxed, his spirit encompassed the entire room. Every single detail and movement of Huang Yue Li\u2019s would not be able to escape his notice.Biting her teeth, Huang Yue Li told herself to be level headed.Looking straight at the man, she said in a unhappy voice: \u201cLord Owner, please drink the tea!\u201dThe man still did not move.Huang Yue Li was further angered and asked: \u201cWhat is the matter now?\u201d\u201cInviting someone to drink tea, shouldn\u2019t you use both your hands and hand the teacup to them? Pushing and shoving the tea like this, isn\u2019t that too rude? And you are esteemed young lady from the Manor!\u201dHuang Yue Li smirked, \u201cIs that so? My apologies, I did that incorrectly. Let me try again.\u201dAs she spoke, her hand went to pick up the teacup. But as she neared the man\u2019s face, she splashed the tea out towards his face!Though the man was momentarily mesmerised by Huang Yue Li\u2019s smile, he still reacted when she moved.Just as Huang Yue Li\u2019s hand began to tilt, her wrist was securely caught.The slender jade hand with a strong as steel-like grip enveloped her tender hands. Firmly trapping them.Huang Yue Li wished to retracted her hands. But even after several rounds of struggling, she was unable to move an inch.Amused, the man continued to exert pressure. Bit by bit, little by little he pulled her hand and the teacup closer towards him.Under the hateful gaze of Huang Yue Li\u2019s, the teacup and her hand arrived at his mouth. Lightly, he took a sip of tea.Purposely or accidentally, his lip brushed with Huang Yue Li\u2019s fingers. His tongue gently slide over, leaving a faint damp feeling.\u201cThe taste isn\u2019t bad.\u201d The man couldn\u2019t help but smile.\u201cYou!\u201dAs soon as her hand was free, Huang Yue Li vigorously wiped her hand on her clothes.He smirked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Was the tea too hot and burned Third Young Miss\u2019 hand? Let this Lord see it? This Lord has some ointment for burns, how about applying some?\u201dHearing his words become more and more excessive, Huang Yue Li\u2019s patience ran out. With a loud \u2018bang\u2019 she slammed the cup onto the table.\u201cOkay, you have already drunk tea. You have also put up the necessary airs, what information do you need to pass on?\u201dSeeing her exasperated manner, he smiled secretly.But he knew that this little girl\u2019s methods were many. As fun as provoking this little fox may be, she was only holding back due to some apprehensions.If he really pushed her to her limits, forcing her hands, perhaps he would suffer a bit.More importantly, the purpose of his visit was to provoke his future Imperial Concubine a bit.So, it should be about time he stopped. It was enough.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I only drank one mouthful of water. I still haven\u2019t eaten anything yet\u2026\u2026\u201dIf looks could kill, the man would have long been cut like tofu from Huang Yue Li\u2019s glares.Receiving something good, he opened his mouth: \u201cBut, since you want to know this badly, this Lord will tell you.\u201cHurry up and speak!\u201dThe man said: \u201cYou are very lucky. In seven days times, it will be the annual Thousand Treasure Pavilion Auction. It is the largest event in South Yue. And your items will be the final presentation for the event.\u201dThoughtfully, Huang Yue Li asked: \u201cAnnual auction?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Said the man, \u201cThere will be a lot of rare treasures on sale. Whether it\u2019s heavenly treasures or natural artifacts, and immortal pills or profound armaments, they will all be available. Numerous forces from neighbouring powers will arrive to participate in the auction.\u201dWith a look of distrust, Huang Yue Li asked: \u201cYou are certain that big clients will be present? In the case that no one recognises the items value, then wouldn\u2019t my armaments be worthless?\u201d In regards to events such as auctions, Huang Yue Li was much too familiar.As a Ninth Tier Armament Master in her past life, many of Huang Yue Li\u2019s works were auctioned off at astronomical prices.As a result, she was too aware of how things worked.The prices of items depended on the value of the item itself. But that value could rise and decrease exponentially with different marketing methods. With correct methods, they would definitely sell for much higher prices!Therefore for an Armament Master, it is essential that they choose the correct auction house to cooperate with.Reaching out, the man tapped her small nose. Smilingly he responded to her: \u201cWhat are you worried about? Rest assured, with this Lord present, you little money grubber will definitely earn your fill! Besides, refining those things are effortless with your ability. Is there a need for you to be so focused on the prices of those little things?\u201d\u201cWhat do you understand?\u201d Huang Yue Li rolled her eyes at him.The\u300aNine Phoenix Transformations\u300b, this kind of heaven opposing technique required enormous resources. With the increase of each level in cultivation, the resources and spirit stones needed multiplied in the tens and hundreds of ranges.Even if it was her past life, with such wealth sitting under her, she would still feel cold sweat on her back. Especially at the face of such an exorbitant demand.This was simply burning money!Can someone really gather enough materials and spirit stones and practice to the ninth transformation? Even the most wealthy man in the Tian Ling Continent, Ancestor Profound Ash Blade would be unable to finance that!Worthy of being the best cultivation manual of a Great God Clan ah\u2026\u2026So in order to practice \u300aNine Phoenix Transformations\u300b, she could not miss out on any money earning opportunity. She would try to plunder all available resources.Due to this, she couldn\u2019t even let off the Wu Wei Manor guards.After all, even the smallest mosquitoes had meat\u2026\u2026\u2026The man was oblivious to the calculations within her heart. But when he looked at her slightly raised chin, he felt that she looked really cute.As he watched that arrogantly proud woman, with a little fox mind and a naturally intelligent personality, he could not pull his eyes away from her.Even his tone carried much spoiling within.\u201cGood, good, good. In any case, if you want money this Lord will accomplish it to the end. I guarantee to help earn enough money.\u201d\u201cYour words hold true?\u201d Huang Yue Li smiled deviously, looking at him, \u201cThe amount that I need, is very, very large\u2026\u2026\u2026a lot of money. Perhaps, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to earn that much in your lifetime.\u201dYou can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The sound of an alluringly sexy voice, temptation clearly felt. It seemed\u2026\u2026like something he casually said to coax the little girl in front of him.But under his masked face, there was no doubt of his conviction.However, Huang Yue Li could not see his face.Even if she could see his face, Huang Yue Li would have never imagined the result. That this man would really accompany her to dig up every possible money source, earning money till it overflowed every pot and basin, walking by her side all the way to the peak.Thus, Huang Yue Li only took the man\u2019s words as a joke and didn\u2019t put it in her heart.She stared at the man for a moment, crying out: \u201cDream on! You want to continue working with me? Not so easy! The products that I produce at all top of the line and will only improve in quality! I have no worries in finding other business partners! You still wish to cooperate with me next time? I must first see your performance!\u201dChuckling, his eyes wantonly travelled from her small face, slowing sweeping down to her white slender neck.\u201cI won\u2019t let you down, you can rest assured.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good then. Seven days later, I await to see your performance.\u201dHuang Yue Li raised her eyes and said: \u201cWell, since you\u2019re finished, can you can go?\u201dStunned for a moment, the man smiled and shook his head.Why was it in this small fox eyes, he appeared so annoying? How many high-born and proud young ladies held secret longing for him? All trying every single means to become close with him?But this little fox completely ignores him. She also couldn\u2019t wait to drive him away!However, what was even more strange was that he didn\u2019t feel displeased. In fact, it made him eager to see her, to approach her\u2026\u2026\u201cWhy are you so anxious to drive me away? Destroying the bridge after crossing it, do you need to show it so blatantly?\u201dHuang Yue Li blinked her eyes, innocently smiling: \u201cLord Owner, what are your words? I want to give you a little more time, to properly prepare for the auction. So if influential buyers do not show up, you would not lose face!\u201dSecretly he smiled. How much did this little girl look down on people?Isn\u2019t she just a Third Tier Armament Master? If no one were to buy her products, he was more than willingly to spend money for her.But he couldn\u2019t disregard the fact, this little girl\u2019s refined armaments held outstanding quality. It would definitely sell for high prices.Laughingly, he looked into the girl\u2019s eyes. His heart moving, he unknowingly closed their distance by a bit.As Huang Yue Li had her guard up against him, when he neared her, she hurriedly stepped back.The approaching hand, when it reached out in an attempt to brush her cheek, instead it only met with empty air.Embarrassed, the man stood up, \u201cOkay then. This Lord will first leave. Seven days later, remember to personally come to the auction. In case you say that this Lord had cheated you of your money!\u201d\u201cOf course I must come to watch! I do not believe you!\u201d Huang Yue Li stated naturally.Looking at her: \u201cThen this Lord will leave.\u201d\u201cHurry up and leave! Could it be you want me to send you off?\u201dThe man heard her words. Walking past her, the man reached out his hand and pulled her into his embrace.As fast lightning, he lightly pecked Huang Yue Li\u2019s soft cheek.

Not only had she been taken advantage of, but also made her heart feel stifled.All the way until the next morning, she felt indignant.As Cai Wei carried the breakfast over the next morning, she was shocked by her frustrated expression. She started to tremble with fear.Seeing the tray of hot xiao long bao and jujube cake, Huang Yue Li\u2019s mood became a lot better.(Note: Xiao long bao - a small meat dumpling filled with soup and meat\u2026\u2026tastes good)Previously, the Back Courtyard did not have its own kitchen. As a result, they had to obtain their meals from the Main Manor. Unfortunately under the influence of the Manor Madam, this task became many times more difficult.Every time, the meals consisted of cold leftovers.As a reborn foodie, Huang Yue Li really could not bear the past few days.Therefore, when she hired new servants, she especially selected a senior chef. It was rumored that the family\u2019s Grandfather Zeng had served in the imperial kitchen. His speciality was pastries.After breakfast, Cai Wei suddenly stopped from a question after picking up the plates.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Cai Wei, do you know\u2026\u2026\u2026if my father let behind anything for me before he went missing?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Cai Wei was stunned for a moment, \u201cThird Young Miss, why do you suddenly ask this? The Old Master left you a lot of things. I heard there are seven estates, more than a dozen shops, and quite a lot of gold, silver, jewelry, calligraphy scrolls and antique paintings. But due to your young age, the Manor Master assumed ownership over them\u2026\u2026\u201dReplying by Huang Yue Li\u2019s side, Cai Wei carefully cast her a glance.\u201cThird Young Miss, it\u2019s all this servant\u2019s fault. I was not able to stop the Master, protecting those\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019m not asking you this.\u201dHuang Yue Li interrupted Cai Wei\u2019s words. As for things like jewelry, calligraphy scrolls and antique paintings, she didn\u2019t put them in her eyes. It was fine if he took them away.She paused and asked: \u201cI meant to say\u2026\u2026my father as the number one expert of South Yue, did not leave behind any immortal pills, materials, or Profound Armaments? Various techniques and skills?\u201dCai Wei blinked and said: \u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u2026the Old Master had left some healing pills. They are kept on the shelves of the study. There are probably seven or eight bottles. But the Second Miss took many over the years, leaving only two bottles. This servant really\u2026\u2026\u2026this servant really doesn\u2019t have any recollection\u2026\u2026\u201dHuang Yue Li frowned.The pills Cai Wei mentioned, she knew of. But those were just first level upper grade Blood Clotting Pills. Towards ordinary people they are quite effective, but towards a high-levelled practitioner, their use was very limited.According to her recently inquired information, Bai Liu Feng\u2019s name wasn\u2019t that powerful, but his power really was strong.He was twenty-five years old when he went missing. At that time, he had reached the Sixth level of the Earth Profound Realm. Even in the Seven Sacred Places, this was rare.Moreover, Bai Liu Feng was born in a barren country like South Yue. Resources and manuals were very scarce. These were harsh conditions, so reaching the Sixth level of the Earth Profound Realm at such a young, he was at the very least an eighth grade talent.Such a character, left his daughter but a few pieces of ordinary jewelry, calligraphy scrolls and first level pills?Huang Yue Li expressed her disbelief.Moreover, it was clear that Bai Liu Jing and Bai Ruo Qi did not believe it either. That resulted in their cross-examination of Bai Ruo Li, in an attempts to find the true treasures left behind.Huang Yue Li pondered a bit and asked: \u201cWell, Cai Wei think a bit harder. When my father left, he really left nothing for me? Not even a little object like a key of some kind?\u201dCai Wei shook her head: \u201cKey?

Try again?She used her Piercing Sky Eye technique, lightly influencing Cai Wei\u2019s subconsciousness.Cai Wei\u2019s pupils suddenly blurred up.But after a while, she shook her head, \u201cThird Young Miss, this servant really has no memory!\u201dHuang Yue Li knew she did not lie. Waving her hand and said: \u201cOkay then, I know. Go rest.\u201dAfter Cai Wei left, Huang Yue Li eyes closed for a while to think. She then went to the yard.The back courtyard no longer had its dilapidated appearance. Ever since the large recruitment of servants, the yard underwent a transformation. Not only were the designs from Huang Yue Li\u2019s, but many beautiful flowers and plants were planted.As the maidservants saw Huang Yue Li walk out, they paid their respects to her.\u201cGreetings to Third Young Miss!\u201d\u201cPaying respects to the Third Young Miss!\u201dHuang Yue Li called a few manservants over, pointing to a rock garden in the northeast: \u201cThe few of you, go destroy that rock garden for me!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThey looked at each other, thinking they misheard.That rock garden had existed for quite some time in the back courtyard. It could be considered one of the main features. Just smashing it like that?Huang Yue Li repeated: \u201cYou did not mishear. Go destroy that. It has been some time since I passed the cultivation technique to you. Seeing that you have trained well, yielding good results, yet you can\u2019t even smash a rock garden?\u201d(Note: Rock garden, it\u2019s a garden but it also has various rock statues and piles)\u201cThis servant dares not. Please wait a bit Third Young Miss, we will go immediately!\u201dThe Third Young Miss taught them precious cultivation techniques, this kindness was too great. It was equivalent to giving them a new life.As a result, all the servants treated Huang Yue Li as their god. Swearing their eternal loyalties to her, not daring to disobey her.Before long, the small pond sized rock garden became a pile of gravel.The servant came back to report: \u201cThird Young Miss, this servant has finished. Which master landscaper do you wish to invite to redesign it?\u201dHuang Yue Li shook her head, \u201cNo need. Go smash that too!\u201dThe next person looked back and found that the Third Young Miss was referring to the West Wing\u2019s corridor! This corridor was attached to the entire building. Smashing that section, will cause that overall image to be destroyed. It would look no different from a construction site.Was the Third Young Miss crazy?However, Huang Yue Li\u2019s attitude was resolute. Everyone listened to her orders, and went to smash the corridor.\u201cGo fill up this water hole for me\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cRemove that tree for me\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dHuang Yue Li spent the entire morning ordering the group of servants. The entire back courtyard ended up being destroyed. The scene was similar to the aftermath of a cyclone blowing through.The servants originally thought that the Third Miss wished to renovate the yard. But she had destroyed so much and without any sense or pattern. It was like she was venting her anger.She couldn\u2019t have been provoked by someone?Cai Wei had run out to stop her, but did not succeed. She had been frightened to death thinking that something that gone wrong with her family\u2019s Miss\u2019 brain.Huang Yue Li ignored their ignorant gazes. Standing in the center of the ruins, she looked up at the sun\u2019s position. Her slender jade finger pointed up, eyes squinting, she quickly began to calculate up.Just after her rebirth, she sensed the courtyard\u2019s peculiarities. Although the appearance was very appaling, it was built very specially. It secretly aligned with the attributes of heaven and earth.The buildings around the courtyard, coincidentally formed a hidden spell formation.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 \u2014 The concealed Hidden TechniquePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBut over the years, no one maintained the courtyard and some lines had been eroded away. The formation was unable to display its full ability.Originally, she felt that something was off. She did not understand why Bai Liu Feng laid down a formation in this location. But she was reminded by Bai Liu Jing\u2019s words and the truth appeared.Bai Liu Feng definitely hid something in this back courtyard, something that he did not want others to find out.This formation was something created by a Formation Master who was at the Fifth Tier or higher. With South Yue\u2019s cultivation quality, there was no one who would be able to break this.Because many high-leveled profound tools could assist Armament Refiners to be promoted, many would study various formations and works.In her past life, Huang Yue Li also studied formations. So she was able to see through this mysterious array.The reason why she made people smash the yard, was not because she had too much money. But she wanted to clear all obstacles in different directions, revealing the array in its entirety.Formations required a very high technical skill. You needed large amounts of precise calculation and excellent control, in order to align with the profound qi within the heavens and creating their own laws. The creation of every single small stroke and line, all relied on the Formation Master\u2019s spirit power.Consequently, a Formation Master\u2019s cultivation talent may be average, but they were all first-class geniuses in spiritual power.Taking the time to burn a stick of incense, Huang Yue Li suddenly opened her eyes.In her eyes, a flash of light swept through.Immediately, she walked straight towards the direction of the study.There, was the eye of the formation.If other Formation Masters were to learn that it took her such a short time to crack a Fifth Tiered Formation Master\u2019s work, they would not believe their eyes.However in this yard, no one was so knowledgeable.In fact, everyone else thought that Huang Yue Li was in a midst of a crazy fit.When Huang Yue Li moved, Cai Wei rushed over. Crying out: \u201cThird Young Miss, where are you going to? You, you\u2026\u2026are you right? Not sick? Feverish? Is your head dizzy? This servant will go find a doctor\u2026\u2026\u201dHuang Yue Li shook her head: \u201cI\u2019m going to stay in the study for a while. You go and find some people to tidy up the courtyard. Do not come to bother me.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026but, Third Young Miss\u2026\u2026\u201d if you are sick, you must treat it ah!However, Huang Yue Li did not wait for her to finish. With a \u2018bang\u2019, the door to the study slammed shut.Isolated from the outside world, Huang Yue Li started to calculate everything in her head again. She walked to side, towards the study\u2019s wall.The wall looked old and some of the painted areas had begun to crack.Huang Yue Li\u2019s pale fingers gently touched the wall a few times.Suddenly, only hearing a \u201cwhoosh whoosh\u201d sound several times, the side of the bookcase opened from the middle. It revealed a dark space hidden behind.Inside the dark space, quietly lay a small mahogany box.Huang Yue Li\u2019s eyes of a brightened, \u201cThat hidden formation really did hide something. It was this thing! I didn\u2019t guess incorrectly!\u201dShe carefully checked the dark space. Convinced that there were no other mechanisms or hidden triggers, she carefully pulled the box out and placed it on the table.The box was particularly small, about as big as two palms.Huang Yue Li faced towards the sunlight. Observing, she found that the box\u2019s four sides fitted seamlessly into each other. Like a complete piece of wood, with no seams or key holes.As a master Armament Refiner, she was very clear that this box was a superior quality Profound Armament. And it needed a special method to open it.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She may possibly trigger the hidden contraptions within. Worst case scenario, it could be life-threatening.However, it was not something too difficult for Huang Yue Li.This kind of seamless box, she had constructed hundreds. She was very clear about the mechanisms.Placing the box straight, she began to observe the lines on the lid. And then carefully she pressed in a few different directions a few times.The box issued a \u2018kacha\u2019 sound.Huang Yue Li\u2019s heart jumped. She knew that the box was activated.However, she had no time to rejoice. The top of the box suddenly flashed. Coupled with the sunlight, it was impossible to see clearly.Huang Yue Li reacted quickly, immediately dodging to the door.Following, three loud \u2018bangs\u2019 echoed from the study. A violent burst of shocks occurred, directly shattering the doors and windows of the study.Not only that, the strong gusts of air also blew out.Though Huang Yue Li dodged, she was still sprayed black and gray with dust. And nearly fell straight to the ground. Simply too embarrassing!She was pushed quite a distance by the air currents. She was blown all the way to the courtyard before coming to a stop.Straightening her waist, she wiped the sweat off her face. But she found out that her hands had been stained black, her heart shook from shock!As a past Ninth Tier Armament Master, she had judged the wrong? This ordinary looking Fifth Level seamless box? Not only did she not open it successfully, she also triggered the hidden mechanisms?How was this possible?\u201cIt was too bad! Just where did I go wrong\u201dHuang Yue Li pouted. Complaining, she wanted to go back to find the box.Cai Wei ran over, stopping in front of her.\u201cThird Young Miss, Third Young Miss, wait a minute! What is wrong with you today? First, the yard was smashed, and you almost bombed down the study. Are you really\u2026\u2026 really alright?\u201dCai Wei carefully asked. Her voice was not too high, as if she feared that she might provoke Huang Yue Li further.Huang Yue Li\u2019s mouth curved upwards.She knew that her series of actions today, was a bit strange. But this girl did not need to express such a face, fearing that she was sick?\u201cCreak\u2014\u2014! Creak!\u201dAt this time, from the sky suddenly came a crisp sound of birds. A golden red bird flew over unsteadily. Onto the sleeves of Huang Yue Li it fell.In its mouth, dangled a drumstick bigger than its body. Roasted fragrant and tender and oil still dripped down.\u201cAh, Wang Cai! Seeing the cage was empty, this servant spent quite some time to search for you! Turns out, you went to the kitchen to eat it! So adorable, so smart, so cute\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dA look of amazement covered Cai Wei.While Huang Yue Li was angered beyond belief!Only she was able to understand the cheeps that the little lousy bird said. The meaning of those chirps were: stinking woman, too ugly, too stupid. That Blood Feather Silk Cage can not be opened like that! You still dare to call yourself a Ninth Tiered Armament Master! You stupidity goes all the way back to your family!She glanced down at the little phoenix.But this child did not fear for his life or death. Triumphantly he shook his small head, chicken oil rubbing onto her sleeves.Huang Yue Li picked it up. Throwing the chicken leg to the side, she carried it back into the study.Just as she wanted to tell Cai Wei to leave, the little Phoenix landed on the floor. Quickly it turned into a small child and jumped towards the door.\u201cThis little lord\u2019s drumstick! Return my drumstick! This drumstick is the most tender and flavourful one.

Turns out that each and every drumstick was tasted by you, little thief?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u201dThe little boy shrunk back his head, realising that he had said too much.But soon, he confidently said: \u201cWell, the last time I spit fire for you, you clearly promised me meat for every meal. Do you want to go back on your word?\u201cI said I would let you eat meat, but I did not let you steal food!\u201dHis head crooked, he arrogantly said: \u201cSo what? This little lord eating your chicken, is giving you face! If not because your chef has barely passable skills, this little lord would not eat at all!\u201d\u201cOh, so you were giving me face\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo what!\u201dHuang Yue Li faintly smile and said: \u201cNo wonder strict education should be given to children. Can\u2019t be too spoiled. It seems that I have no experience.\u201dThe little boy looked up and found the female devil\u2019s smile a bit sinister. He felt danger.He took a step back, \u201cYou\u2026what do you to do? I warn you\u2026\u2026\u201dNot waiting for him to finish, Huang Yue Li picked from him and faced him down. Ass up, she put him on her thigh.In the face of one of her strikes, the small boy\u2019s face to whitened. Immediately he started to cry wolf.\u201cSave me ah! The female devil is beating people! Wuu wuu wuu, bullying me a little phoenix who has no father, no mother, no elder brother! Your heart is too evil!Well then, hit me, kill me. But if you do, no one will be able to tell you how to open that box!\u201dAs he was crying, he twisted his neck back to see Huang Yue Li\u2019s expression.Naturally Huang Yue Li noticed his gaze, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.The way this child was acting, it was like she really had the intention to kill him.Don\u2019t be fooled by his mournful cries. In actuality, there were no tears in his eyes. Furthermore, she had yet to touch his butt. Wasn\u2019t he too enthusiastic?However, when she heard him mention the box, she released him.\u201cDo you know what the box is?\u201dHuang Yue Li did not think that her knowledge regarding armaments would be worse than others. It can only be said that the thing within that box was not ordinary.Although one could not see it, but the little phoenix after all was a sacred beast. Although it was a little unreliable, its knowledge was certainly higher than hers. Maybe it could really tell her what the box was.The little phoenix rolled his eyes and said: \u201cHehe, this thing\u2026\u2026\u201dBy Huang Yue Li\u2019s analysis, she guessed that this little arrogant child wanted to strike another pretentious pose.She immediately interrupted him, \u201cLittle Wang Cai, elder sister must remind you, this elder sister has yet to settle debts from yesterday. You must be careful on how you speak today!\u201cYesterday, what happened yesterday?\u201d The little Phoenix did not understand.Huang Yue Li smilingly said: \u201cLittle brat. You are elder sister\u2019s contracted spirit tool ah. Why do you not appear last night, even after numerous calls from me?\u201dLast night, when the master of Thousand Treasure Pavilion appeared, Huang Yue Li had attempted to call out the little phoenix. A single spray of True Phoenix Fire, even if it didn\u2019t kill that man, it would have told him to scram immediately!She did not expect that this little brat at the critical moment was so unreliable. No matter how she called him, he did not react. She suspected he had gone to steal more food again!You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How could you make me deal with such a terrible man\u2026\u2026this one\u2019s age is still young, and still wants to live a few more years\u2026\u2026\u201dHuang Yue Li raised her eyebrows: \u201cWhat? Was he that terrifying? Do not give me such an excuse. You must be deliberately refusing to help! Eating so many chicken legs, when I ask you to work a little, you are unwillingly. Aren\u2019t you a least a little bit ashamed? Do you only know to eat and nothing else?\u201cI am not someone who knows only to eat!\u201d The little boy reasonably argued, \u201cWhat I said was true. That mask wearing man is really terrifying\u2026\u2026you do not understand, he has a very mysterious and powerful qi force. It really suffocates people.\u201dHuang Yue Li looked at the little phoenix strangely and said: \u201cWell then. I also think that man holds extraordinary strength, but\u2026\u2026\u2026but you are a powerful and ancient phoenix. Even if you are young and your strength may not be comparable to him, you wouldn\u2019t be suppressed by his qi force. Refusing to even reveal yourself?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u2026I do not know what was going on, but I really didn\u2019t lie!\u201dThe little phoenix was afraid she would hit his little ass, so he quickly covered his butt. Moving to the side and hiding himself while crying out ai\u2019s and ah\u2019s: \u201cAs soon as the man appeared, an innate aura of overbearingness seeped out from his bones. Nearly made me kneel on the ground to him. That kind of aura, you mortals cannot sense, but for me it was really terrible. So I did not come out!\u201d\u201cWas it that horrible?\u201d Huang Yue Li asked suspiciously.The little boy fiercely nodded his head, \u201cIt\u2019s true! I think his bloodline must be very strong. Only then, would he be able to let me experience that kind of feeling\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBloodline?\u201d Huang Yue Li frowned, \u201cWhat kind of bloodline can be stronger than an ancient beasts?\u201dThe little boy was also perplexed. Tilting his head, he thought for a while.\u201cTruthfully, if you were in the God Realm, the bloodlines of some noble families are truly stronger than the bloodlines of us ancient beasts. But currently we are in the Lower Realm\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026I really can\u2019t think of anything\u2026\u2026\u201dHuang Yue Li\u2019s brows wrinkled up.According to the little phoenix\u2019s statement, did that mean that the man held a bloodline that rivalled someone from the God Realm?But that was impossible ah. Because it was said that tens of thousands of years ago, the passage between the Tian Ling Continent and the God Realm was sealed due to some particular reasons. The profound qi within the environment also became much more sparse.That was the reason why there were so few experts within Tian Ling Continent.Moreover, if the man\u2019s bloodline truly was that powerful, he would not be lingering in such a weak country like South Yue. With his talent, any of the grand powers within Tian Ling Continent would be fighting for him.Huang Yue Li thought for a while. Even as her head started to hurt, she could not think of anything.Shaking her head, she suddenly saw a tiny and suspicious figure from the corner of her eyes.In tiny steps, the little boy was stealthily inching towards the door.She coughed, \u201cWang Cai!\u201d\u201cDamn!\u201d The little boy immediately stood up straight, \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026\u2026\u2026I am saying\u2026\u2026\u2026I am not called Wang Cai!

The phoenix did a play on words with zhu ren, because pig is also zhu\u2026\u2026so pig head/person)Huang Yue Li pricked up her eyebrows, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u2026did not say anything\u2026\u2026\u201d Sealing his lips, the boy used his chin to point in the direction of the box, \u201cThat box, is not the Seamless Silk Box that you say it is. Instead, it is a Blood Feather Silk Cage. When I was a baby phoenix, I had seen this type of object in the God Realm. Did not expect to your Tian Ling Continent to also possess one!\u201dHuang Yue Li was stunned, \u201cGod Realm?\u201dHow was it the God Realm?No wonder she had never seen such a method to make this seamless box. So it was\u2026\u2026a technique from the God Realm?However, Bai Liu Feng was only a Marquis in a small country. How was he able to possess such a box?The little phoenix said: \u201cTake up the box and look at in the light. Do you not see the feather pattern on the lid of the box?\u201dListening, Huang Yue Li took quite a bit of time finding the imprint. Even then she could only see a faint craving. If not for his hinting, she would have glossed over that completely.\u201cThat\u2019s right. What now?\u201d\u201cThis kind of Blood Feather Silk Cage, is mainly used for the passing messages in a family. Only those who share the same bloodline can open the box. Drip your blood onto the feather and the box will open. No matter how much you press it will not open. Furthermore, if you fail more than three times, it will self-destruct. Destroying the things inside as well.\u201dHearing his words, Huang Yue Li placed the box back onto the table. Using her fingernails, she cut open her finger.A drop of bright red blood formed on her white rounded fingertip, dropping onto the lid.This time, nothing happened.\u201cSnap\u201d it lightly sounded as the lid bounced up.Laughing, Huang Yue Li happily patted his head.\u201cSo obedient! Continue eating your drumsticks! Tomorrow, this sister will buy you a lot of chicken legs. Not only can you roast them, you can also steam, braise, fry\u2026\u2026\u201dThe boy\u2019s drooled, his saliva dripping to the ground.This blessing came far to suddenly!At this moment, the female devil had become particularly generous, beautiful, lovely! Second only to chicken drumsticks!\u201c\u2026\u2026Then I also want chicken wings!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dIn a good mood, Huang Yue Li waved her hand and agreed.Changing back into a fluffy yellow bird, he happily flew away.Walking towards the table, Huang Yue Li settled down to views the contents.Inside the small mahogany box, quietly lay a scroll.Huang Yue Li was no stranger to this. This used refined Sea Sand Grass and engraved into a type of paper. The traits of this paper was that it could only be read once. Furthermore it could be stored thousand of years without rotting.Generally, these were used by large Sect Masters and Heads to record secret techniques.Reaching out, she slowly opened it.On the scroll, the words flowed naturally and like a flowing river. When people saw the words on the scroll, they would be able to the tell that the writer was someone of great grace and noble character.\u201cTo my beloved daughter Ruo Li\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen the first line of words greeted her, Huang Yue Li\u2019s mind shook.This really was a letter her father Bai Liu Feng left behind for her!You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

While she would turn fourteen this years. Calculating that, it would be around a decade.It looked like Bai Liu Feng had prepared to leave for an extended period of time. It was not a case of meeting with an unfortunate accident, but out of his own initiative.Huang Yue Li slightly frowned.Her father\u2019s reputation in the South Yue was very good, he was a good man of righteousness. In the end what was the reason that forced him to leave his young daughter?Soon, she found her answer in the long letter.Bai Liu Feng was indeed a very rare cultivating genius with eighth grade talent. But because he was born in South Yue, it delayed his progress and starting point.Nevertheless, when he was seventeen years old, he broke through to the fourth level of cultivation - Dan Profound Realm. He became the best of South Yue\u2019s practitioners.From that day onwards, he would travel in all directions to enhance his cultivation. He even formed on a famous mercenary group within South Sky Region\u2014\u2014becoming the Head of the North Wind Mercenaries.It was during that time, he met an outstanding woman who possessed even greater talent than his own. She was the mother of Bai Ruo Li.After going through many experiences together, the two gradually grew attracted to each other. Later they returned to South Yue, married and gave birth to the clever, quick-witted, adorable as white jade daughter, Bai Ruo Li.Reading to this point, Huang Yue Li became somewhat flabbergasted.\u201cStrange, that cheap father was already an eighth grade talent, but mother had greater talent than him. Could she have ninth grade talent? This was too unlikely?\u201dIn the Tian Ling Continent, ninth grade talent talent only appeared only once every hundred years or so.In her past life, because Huang Yue Li had ninth grade talent, she was taken by the Mythical Flame Palace at the tender age of three. Entering their doors, with the Palace\u2019s power, she carefully cultivated.In history, each and every ninth grade talent genius were famous characters within the continent. Even if they came from humble beginnings, each and every one would rise up.If Bai Ruo Li\u2019s mother was such a person, how come she had never heard her name before\u2026\u2026Huang Yue Li continued to read.The contents onwards, just became worse.Soon after Bai Ruo Li\u2019s mother gave birth to her, a mysterious man came knocking. Forcibly, he took her away!In order to not implicate her husband and daughter, she promised to leave with him. But secretly, she left a letter behind for Bai Liu Feng.The letter told the Bai Liu Feng, the person who took her away was her clansmen, and not an existence he could contend against. It told him not think about her again. Also mentioning that he must not leak news about their daughter out, otherwise she would definitely be taken away!The love of his life was taken away just like that. Bai Liu Feng was heartbroken beyond belief.Although his wife\u2019s letter asked him not to find her, how could Bai Liu Feng not?Crazily, he began to cultivate to improve his cultivation. All the while, he frantically searched for the whereabouts of his wife. Finally three years later, he obtained a clue.He knew that he was entering dangerous waters, with very slim chances of returning. He also couldn\u2019t stop worry about his young daughter.However, this fleeting opportunity to find his wife, he could not let go so easily.Otherwise he would regret it for a lifetime!You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With a large possibility to be even greater!Ten years later, his daughter would also reach the fourth boundary, Dan Profound Realm.While the formation he left behind, its effect would also weaken over time.Once Bai Ruo Li broke through to the Dan Profound Realm, she would be able to break the hidden formation. Then she would obtain the letter and understand everything.\u201cSo it was like this\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dReading everything, Huang Yue Li slowly closed the scroll and let out a sad sigh.Bai Liu Feng had planned out everything so meticulously, leaving with great confidence. But things were could not be without variables. With the development of things, many deviated greatly from his expectations.The years before Bai Liu Feng disappeared, Bai Liu Jing only acted like a good brother. Respectful of his elder brother, their brotherly bond deep.Even in his dreams Bai Liu Feng could not predict that once he left, his brother would turn into a blind eye wolf. Abusing his niece.In addition, while Bai Ruo Li inherited her parents extraordinary talents, and even greater. Her talents were too heaven-defying, leading her display something that was equivalent to a good-for-nothing\u2026\u2026It was like a big pair of invisible hands were present, manipulating the fate of everything.Once the scroll closed, there was no spontaneous combustion. But shortly afterwards, it turned into black ash.As Huang Yue Li\u2019s sight returned back to the mahogany box, her eyes landed on the small jade lying in the corner.In Bai Liu Feng\u2019s letter, he had mentioned that the jade could be used to access his treasures. Many years of travelling through South Sky Region allowed him to collect many treasures, which were all hidden in a secret safe.Picking up the jade, Huang Yue Li gave it a closer look.On the side of the jade it read: Third earthly branch third day, left eleven, upper two nine.What did that mean?Eyebrows arched, Huang Yue Li made a face. On the other side were two ancient engraved words.She only glances at it. But when she recognised them, her eyes widened and revealed her shock!Celestial Light!Engraved on the jade, were actually the two words \u2018Celestial Light\u2019!If you were to mention those words in the South Sky Domain, there was no one who would not know it.That was because Celestial Light was the largest sect within the South Sky Domain. This influence was spread through every one of the hundreds of tiny countries in the domain. Even the Domain Master must pay his respects to a Celestial Light Sect core disciple.Within the Tian Ling Contient, the Celestial Light Sect held equal standing with the major forces.The engravings of Celestial Light was the symbol of the sect. An average person would not dare to imitate it.What relationship did Bai Liu Feng have with the Celestial Light Sect?Also, this jade piece with those nonsensical numbers, what was their meaning?Huang Yue Li originally thought that Bai Liu Feng had given her a treasure map!In the end, it she who had dreamed too blissfully.No matter how she checked the box, apart from the jade pendant and letter, there were no other clues.At her wit\u2019s end, Huang Yue Li could only put away the jade pendant and seamless box.You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Afterwards, she told them to prepare dinner.While eating, Cai Wei constantly held a hesitant expression, obviously she felt that something was off with her Young Miss today. Especially after those actions.Huang Yue Li turned a blind eye to this.Within her mind, she only thought about the letter and jade pendant.Today, she tried every means to break the hidden formation, to find the letter Bai Liu Feng left behind. It was only to find the truth of her father\u2019s disappearance.She did not expect, that once she read the letter, her question was not answered. Only more questions formed.In the end what kind of identity did Bai Ruo Li\u2019s mother possess? Why was she a ninth grade talent, yet remained unknown to the word? What kind of family could nurture ninth grade talents and still remain so obscure?From the knowledge of her past life, Huang Yue Li heard of practically all experts. Each of the major forces affairs were always within her information network.But she did not hear of the mysterious identity behind her mother. This was too shocking!Huang Yue Li vaguely felt that the continent held a lot of secrets.In her past life she was infinitely close to the martial peak; at the very least she could glimpse the threshold. But the harsh reality was, she had merely been looking at the sky from the bottom of a well! Her view was far too narrow!Additionally, what kind of clue did Bai Liu Feng find, that made him so desperately leave his daughter?And the jade pendant he left behind, what was its meaning?All this mystery, all so intricate. Completely made her unable to make heads or tails\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Seven days passed by.Soon, it was the day of the annual auction of Thousand Treasure Pavilion.Huang Yue Li rose early, ready to rush to Thousand Treasure Pavilion and participate.She did not trust that man. Such an important event, it was best if she personally went to observe the auction\u2019s situation. If she was swindled by him, she would not help him count his money!But just as she stepped out of the gates, she was astounded.There was silence on the street. A golden sandalwood horse carriage stopped in front of her.Curtain sliding open, a tall, elegant and extravagant man stepped down from the carriage. Wearing his mask, he emitted his mysterious and bewitching temperament.Huang Yue Li did not expect to meet him here. Face falling, she wanted to make a detour.Taking a step forward, the man blocked her path.\u201cThird Young Miss Bai, where are you going?\u201d His low and sexy voice, carried a faint trace of a smile as it travelled into her ears.This voice was extremely mystifying. But in the ears of Huang Yue Li, it became rather annoying.She turned her head and stared at the man, saying: \u201cWhere am I going, it does not seem to have any relation to you? On the other hand Lord Owner, why are blocking someone\u2019s path early in the morning? Could you have the intention to do something unlawful?\u201d\u201cThird Young Miss Bai, your words make this Lord\u2019s heart hurt. How could you think like this?\u201dHis lips hooked up, releasing his irresistible allure. But still carried a strong sense of power.\u201cAre you sure you want to go to Thousand Treasure Pavilion and participate in the auction? This Lord was afraid walking there would not be convenient, hence why I came to pick you up.\u201dHuang Yue Li wished to say no, but thought otherwise., Since there was a free carriage to ride, why did she have to exert energy herself?

Using a some force, he pulled her into his arms.\u201cWhat are you doing??\u201d Huang Yue angrily glanced up.The man tightened his arms. As he felt the waist that seemed it would snap with a little force, her body\u2019s warmth and breathing, his heart couldn\u2019t help but send out waves of emotion.Eyes falling on her pink coloured lips, he smiled wantonly.\u201cThis carriage is too high. You are not a practitioner, so climbing up would be too hard. This Lord will carry you up! Don\u2019t move around too much!\u201d\u201cNot hard. No need for you to trouble yourself!\u201dHuang Yue Li began to struggle too late, as he had already carried her into the carriage.Fortunately, once in the carriage, he did not continue to hold her. But he gently released his arms.Regaining her freedom, Huang Yue Li gave him a supercilious look.Since she was already in the carriage, she didn\u2019t continue to be unreasonable. Minding her own business, she settled herself down.On the small table was fine translucent tea set with a small fire underneath the teapot. Sitting in the teapot was still the top quality Clear Red Grass Tea.It was not Huang Yue Li\u2019s first time in the carriage, and regardless of what the man was doing, she poured herself a cup of tea. Sipping the tea, she looked out the window.The man pricked up his eyebrows.This little fox was so spontaneous. Did she treat herself as the owner of the carriage? If she thought like that, it made him extremely happy!However, she just poured her own tea and completely treated him a peerless man as thin air. Was there a problem with her sense of beauty, or a problem with her sight?No matter what the problem was, it must be corrected!Secretly coming to this conclusion, he quietly leaned towards his little fox.Looking out the window, Huang Yue Li was trying to guess the results of today\u2019s auction.Suddenly, the man\u2019s voice sounded from near her ear. It was practically beside her ear.\u201cLittle girl, what are you thinking?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u201dHuang Yue Li was startled. Did this man study a special hidden movement technique? Why did he not even make a little bit of noise or movement, indicating he had moved behind her.Bluntly, the man sat right next to her.Huang Yue Li was sitting in a seat meant for one person. Because the man forcibly squeezed himself in, there two people stuck side by side.She turning her head, she looked at him with a displeasure. Just as she planned to get up, \u201cWhat are you doing? Since you like my seat so much, I will let you have it!\u201dWho knew that as soon as she stood up, the man hook onto her waist from behind. And also also tripped her foot.Unstable, Huang Yue Li could only sit back down. Not only that, she sat down on his thighs.\u201cLet go of me!\u201dHuang Yue Li did not think this man would be so shameless, and immediately struggled to rise.He laughed in her ear and said: \u201cNot releasing!

No matter how she struggled, she could not budge at all.As the man\u2019s hot breath blew onto her sensitive earlobe, her facial temperature unconsciously rose.Taking a deep breath, she stabilized her breathing and said: \u201cLord Owner, your words are bit off! I do not know why you are so concerned about me, but I have no interest in you! I can see your cultivation is very high, your extravagance it not little either.

What do you mean?\u201dThe man\u2019s heart filled with warmth, a happy heart. His tone carrying traces of languidness.\u201cNothing. It seems this Lord misunderstood you. Since you are not voluntarily sitting into the arms of this Lord, this Lord will not hold you any longer. You may go!\u201dFinishing, he really loosened his arm.Phoenix Yue never thought that this man suddenly become so easy to reason with. She froze for a momentHe didn\u2019t deliberately take advantage of her? Why did he only hold for a bit, before letting go?The man smiled and looked at her, \u201cWhat? Not willing to go? Then don\u2019t be reluctant to admit your mistake. Obediently serve this Lord a cup of tea\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cKeep dreaming! Who is not willing to go??\u201dHuang Yue Li snapped at him. Immediately stood up and intended to leave.However, before she could stand firmly, the carriage shook violently.Outside the window, came a loud and clear horse neigh, then the coachman\u2019s cries. Clearly the Flowing Cloud Colt had been frightened.With Huang Yue Li\u2019s center of gravity unstable, shaking to and fro she was unable to gain proper footing. Once again, she fell into the iron like arms of the man.The next moment, the man\u2019s arms coiled around her again.Next to her ear, came his wanton chuckle, \u201cLittle girl, you really can not bear to leave this Lord, but also embarrassed to admit!\u201dHuang Yue Li almost vomited blood.The Flowing Cloud Colt was a Fifth Grade Demonic Beast. Regardless of the terrain, muddy or rugged road, it would be able to cross it like it was walking across flat plains. How can the capital\u2019s smooth roads causally startle it?Most certainly the man had done some secret tricks!She could only blame herself for not expecting this man to play her like that!As the man saw Huang Yue Li\u2019s puffed up cheeks on her little face, his mouth rose up naturally into a smug smile.In front of other people, this little fox was always so calm; nothing could make her surprised or panicked. Only he could make this black bellied little fox, reveal this angry look.An expression exclusive to him\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Of course, he would like to see this little fox act a little like an ordinary woman. Coming into his arms and acting like spoiled child.That day, should be coming soon, right?You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Third Levelled Profound Armaments are very rare, even the country\u2019s Royal Family are very interested. They have dispatched someone over to the auction as well! Just patiently wait for your money to come.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Since you speak like this, you put all your effort into the auction?\u201dHuang Yue Li casted him a side glance.In the past few days, Huang Yue Li noticed the many news faces appearing within the capital\u2019s crowds. It was very obvious that they had come from neighbouring countries. Judging from their clothes, they were all very wealthy.Needless to say, these people had come for the auction.As the carriage neared Thousand Treasure Pavilion, the horse carriages and pedestrians increased in number. One could imagine how lively Thousand Treasure Pavilion would be today.Thinking of her money, Huang Yue Li\u2019s mouth finally exposed a trace of a smile.The man\u2019s gaze filled with nostalgia landed on her smile. He thought that her money grubber attitude was very adorable, causing his heart to thump.He whispered: \u201cThat\u2019s right, this Lord naturally made every effort to complete your matter well.\u201dHuang Yue Li lifted her chin, saying: \u201cYou sure can speak well!\u201dShe knew that she could not leave this man and did not struggle. Thus she turned her attention back to outside window.While the man was unwilling to avert his own attention to things outside of the horse carriage. His complete attention was all directed to the little fox within his arms. To be able to hold her within his arms, he really wished this moment to go on for longer.However, the journey from her back courtyard to Thousand Treasure Pavilion was not far away. Before long, the carriage came to a stop.Patting the man\u2019s arm, Huang Yue Li said: \u201cWe\u2019re here, let\u2019s quickly get off!\u201dUnexpectedly the man did not move but lowly laughed: \u201cWhat\u2019s the urgency? We arrived too early, and with thousands of people in front of Thousand Treasure Pavilion, why do we need to force our way through? We\u2019ll get off just before the doors open!\u201dHuang Yue Li hesitated for a moment. Pursing her lips together: \u201cThis ah\u2026\u2026ok then\u2026\u2026\u201dSmiling, the man looked as if he was about to molest her. Suddenly he felt a sharp pain.While Huang Yue Li was still a bit confused, she had suddenly stepped down hard.She was proficient in a variety of sneak attacks, stepping on that location was very tricky. Not only did she step down, she also began grinding too. That was you called a true aching foot, sore beyond belief!From atop her head, the man\u2019s cries travelled. While the pressure on her waist relaxed a bit.Throwing her elbow backwards, Huang Yue Li heavily hit the man\u2019s chest. Taking advantage of his stunned state, she quickly jumped out of his arms.\u201cWait on in the carriage yourself. I will get off first!\u201dTurning her head from the door of the carriage, Huang Yue Li proudly smiled at him and proceeded to jump down.Bent down at the waist, he clutched his chest. When he did this, he happened to see her fox-like smile revealing a set of pointy teeth. Making her seem more like a fox.It took him quite a while to regain himself. A flash on interest swept past his eyes.\u201cReally good\u2026\u2026\u2026too treacherous\u2026\u2026however, this Lord just likes this kind of interesting person. Little fox, don\u2019t think of running away. Sooner or later, this Lord will bring you back with me!\u201dYou can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The entrance and roads bustling with people coming and going.\u201cWow, what is this situation? Today, how many people have come to Thousand Treasure Pavilion?\u201dA passerby saw the scene and exclaimed out in surprise.\u201cYou don\u2019t even know? Today is the annual auction of Thousand Treasure Pavilion!\u201d\u201cAuction? Do you think I have not seen an auction of Thousand Treasure Pavilion\u2019s before? How many people have attended in the previous years? Generally, only the aristocrats in the capital will attend. At most, a few people living in the Royal Palace would also attend. Do you seen that horse carriage? It has the symbol of the Royal Family of the South Chu ah! Do you know South Chu? In the surrounding countries, they are the most powerful country!\u201d\u201cHow do I not know? Let me tell you, the people participating are not only South Chu\u2019s Royal Family.

Is it that big of a deal?\u201d\u201cI heard that this auction has Third Levelled Profound Armaments for sale.\u201d\u201cThird Levelled Armaments?! No wonder so many royal families have been alerted. If Third Levelled Armaments are to appear, wouldn\u2019t only those royals be able to afford it?\u201d\u201cNot just one Third Levelled Armament. I heard that this time\u2019s auction will be selling a large amount of Third Levelled Armaments! Seven days ago, Thousand Treasure Pavilion publicity displayed a portion. It caused a sensation, attracting so many people\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cA large number of Third Levelled Armaments? How can that be possible? Just a single one is able to drive those Royals into a bidding frenzy. And a large number? Where did Thousand Treasure Pavilion obtain them from?\u201d\u201cHey, this is where you\u2019re ignorant! I heard that a large sect\u2019s Armament Master passed by our South Yue and sent his disciple to Thousand Treasure Pavilion to sell his works. Even the Armament Guild\u2019s Vice President Yan admires this mysterious master!\u201d\u201cNo wonder! Even Grandmaster Yan admires this Armament Master, he should have good skills! This mysterious sect\u2019s master definitely is someone of virtue and prestige! It\u2019s no wonder that today is very lively. It makes even me want to attend and watch.\u201d\u201cJust by you? I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t afford the tickets for this auction.\u201dListening to the conversation of the passers-by, Huang Yue Li\u2019s mouth held a trace of a smile. Soon after, her eyes moved to another section of the street.Parked around were many high-end carriages. Each and every one was very luxurious, while some carriages were engraved with the emblems of the neighbouring Royal Families.It seemed that the man did not lie to her. Many big buyers had come.She walked straight to the front door, but was suddenly stopped by the guard.\u201cThis Young Miss, do you have an invitation?\u201d\u201cInvitation card?\u201dSeeing she was at a loss, the guard revealed some impatience.\u201cYoung Miss, if you are just an ordinary guest, please go to the right door, line up and pay the admission fee! By the way you will need to pay thirty-two silvers for one ticket for this auction. Please prepare in advance.\u201dHuang Yue Li suddenly fell silent.High-levelled auctions will divide into seats into VIP and ordinary seats. But there were also discretion tickets. These were the auction rules used throughout Tian Ling Continent.However, as the continent\u2019s best Armament Master, this was the first she was blocked outside.That stinking man probably predicted this outcome. He deliberately did not send her an invitation, waiting for her to bump into nail and come asking him for help!You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Looking at your back, I felt it was a little familiar. I thought that I saw incorrectly!\u201dTurning around, Huang Yue Li saw Bai Ruo Qi standing not too far away.She frowned faintly.Today she was ready to watch the bustling and the experience the feeling of money rolling in, her mood really good. What she didn\u2019t expect to encounter was an annoying person, ruining her mood.Just seven days ago, Bai Ruo Qi\u2019s white face was swollen like a pig\u2019s. But now, all that swelling had disappeared. She returned to her bright and clean looking face.It looked like a Second Tier Alchemist had cured her face. Otherwise, there was no possibility for it to heal that quickly!Furthermore, Bai Ruo Qi was dressed very laviously today. She wore an exquisite golden embroidered skirt. Not only her makeup further enhanced her beauty, she was also sporting a variety of precious pearls and gems.Though her dress style was extravagant, it did not seem gaudy. It was just enough to bring out her beauty. Paired with that smile that wasn\u2019t quite a smile and her calm and tranquil tone, it really made her seem like an outstanding noble lady!Huang Yue Li measured her up and smiled: \u201cI was wondering who it was. So it was Second Sister! Why have you come out? I heard that you suffered a very serious injury and have been recuperating in the Manor lately. All this time, not daring to meet with others!\u201dBai Ruo Qi responded with surprise: \u201cThird Sister, where did you hear those rumors from? I just caught a slight cold, nothing much. A few days of rest at home is enough. How did such tragic rumors come about?\u201dHer tone was a bit helpless, her brows also wrinkled.If you were to just see her expression, you would think that Huang Yue Li was a very stupid younger sister. Not listening to her elder sister\u2019s teachings, causing her much embarrassment in public!This woman\u2026\u2026\u2026was worthy of being the goddess to many young males in South Yue. The complete opposite to that simpled-minded Bai Ruo Yan. She really knew how to act in public.Huang Yue Li pricked up her eyebrows, \u201cSo they were merely rumors ah\u2026\u2026\u2026then I congratulate Second Sister in restoring her health! However, you should be careful when leaving the Manor in the future. My back courtyard is very dilapidated and very windy. Second Sister should visit less, what if you catch another \u2018cold\u2019!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Bai Ruo Qi displayed a hurt expression.Act, continue to act!Huang Yue Li was displeased by her disgusting heart.But her mind still reminded her of the big auction about to be held. She did not have the time to trade empty words her. She could find later opportunities to retaliate.So with a few mocking words, she was ready to leave!However, just as Huang Yue Li turned to leave, she was stopped.A clear male voice was heard: \u201cThird Young Miss Bai is so arrogant and domineering. You do not even give your cousin the proper etiquette! Seeing is truly a hundred times better than not seeing! This one has really experienced it today!\u201dTaking a step, Huang Yue Li raised her head in surprise.Standing beside Bai Ruo Qi was a graceful man. His five visceras were extremely handsome and had an outstanding temperament. His robe was bright yellow, further enhancing and excluding his noble and virtuous aura.He indifferently chuckled, especially when he saw Huang Yue Li in the distance. That laugh also held a trace of contempt.This man\u2026\u2026looked a little familiar ah\u2026\u2026Suddenly bursts of exclamations sounded.\u201cThe Crown Prince! His Royal Highness the Crown Prince! Today\u2019s auction even attracted His Royal Highness the Crown Prince as well!\u201d\u201cAre the Profound Armaments auctioned today that powerful?

She mostly likely is his Imperial Concubine?\u201dListening to the surrounding passers-by discussions, the noble girl embarrassedly lowered her head.His Royal Highness had long become accustomed to the pursuit of others. His facial expression, his fanning motions only served to further his romantic and suave heroic air. Prompting frequent peeks from surroundings girls.While Bai Ruo Qi who was standing near the Crown Prince inched closer to him.Hearing the envy and jealousy of the nearby girls, she couldn\u2019t help but become proud.Sure enough, only a beautiful and talented girl like herself, could be worthy of the Crown Prince. If others wanted to fight with her, take a look mirror ask themselves if they\u2019re worthy!The Crown Prince had agreed to come to the auction today with her. She did waste her various preparations towards the Crown Prince.That little slut Bai Ruo Li, did she not arrogantly say that the person marrying the Crown Prince was not certain?She really wanted to eat swan meat!Aren\u2019t she and the Crown Prince together? Does she have anymore to say? That little slut mostly likely wants to drill a hole in the ground and hide there.Bai Ruo Qi\u2019s proud gaze swept over Huang Yue Li\u2019s expressionless one.\u201cHis Royal Highness, please do not blame my Third Sister. She grew up with no father and mother, and with no cultivational talent. So her temper is a bit weird. It is but human nature, I do not mind.\u201dPrince looked into her eyes, his expression softening.\u201cQi\u2019er, you have too good of a character, too generous! This kind of woman who does not know proper courtesy, I am afraid also uses her Region Princess title wildly at home, angering you many times?

The stifled feeling she had been suppressing was released. With a compassionate expression, she sympathetically looked towards Huang Yue Li.Huang Yue Li pricked up her eyebrows, looking into their eyes was like looking at two idiots!No wonder\u2019s Bai Ruo Qi and the Second Madam were so anxious to send her to her death. Bai Ruo Qi had long hooked up with the Crown Prince, so she found her younger sister an eyesore. She wished to eliminate the biggest block in her path.Speaking of which, this Crown Prince also held a ruthless look.When Bai Liu Feng first went missing, he still treated Bai Ruo Li well. From his youth, he would take care of her like a fiance would.Who could predict that Bai Liu Feng would not come back. Coupled with the fact that Bai Ruo Li did not have an ounce of cultivation talent, the Crown Prince\u2019s attitude did an one hundred eighty degree flip.Towards Bai Ruo Li\u2019s tragic predicament, he turned towards more promising prospects. His gaze turned to Bai Ruo Qi, who was more suitable to become his Imperial Concubine.While silly Bai Ruo Li still remembered the Crown Prince older brother. She assumed that the engagement between them was still valid, believing that he would sooner or later come and take her away from this suffering!She lightly laughed: \u201cSo you are the Crown Prince ah\u2026\u2026\u2026tsk tsk, meeting in person really is better. What number one genius? Not only is your talent mediocre, even your intellect seems to be damaged!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026you dare to talk to this Royal like this?!\u201dThis was the first time the Crown Prince experienced such ridicule.

Haha\u2026 I am really starting to doubt if there is something wrong with your eyes too?\u201d\u201cBold! Really such a vulgar woman! Daring to mouth such outrageous claims infront of this Royal. One can only imagine how you usually bully Qi\u2019er!\u201dThe Crown Prince\u2019s face was slightly flushed, glaring at Huang Yue Li.\u201cBoom\u201d it sounded!The profound qi within the Crown Prince\u2019s body burst out, creating a powerful pressure.In an instant, the crowd\u2019s faces turned pale, their chests stuffy as they quickly escaped.Even Bai Ruo Qi felt her chest tighten, nearly vomiting blood.She quickly retreated a few steps, trace of a smile floating on her face.Huang Yue Li that idiot, even dared to provoke His Royal Highness! He was an expert at the seventh level of the Defensive Profound Realm. Her demonic techniques would useless in front of him.With the Crown Prince\u2019s noble status, Bai Ruo Li was nothing even with her Region Princess title!She was finished!With the passing of each second and minute, no one dared to linger. Clutching her stomach, Bai Ruo Qi retreated thirty feet!However, the person suffering the majority of this pressure, Huang Yue Li acted as if she felt nothing. Casually she smiled.\u201cHow could you\u2026\u2026?\u201d The Crown Prince was shocked.Someone who possessed no profound qi could resist his seventh level Defensive Profound Realm aura! And so easily? He may as well go meet a ghost!They still say that this little girl was a cultivational trash?He couldn\u2019t help but look at Huang Yue Li a few times.Compared to the carefully dressed Bai Ruo Qi, Huang Yue Li was clothed in a very common white dress with a purple fox like vest. On her ears were a small set of small pearl earrings.She was originally elegant looking. So why when she dressed like this, she became as ordinary and tasteless as water.However, in such an appearance, it was she was glowing. Just by standing there, she had her own elegant and pure demeanor.A cold alienated blossom, looking so special. Cold and arrogant, overwhelmingly fragrant!For a short duration, the Crown Prince was a bit bedazzled.Bai Rou Qi gnashed her teeth hard.How could it be? Why did the little slut not vomit blood, still standing there perfectly fine?And the Crown Prince\u2019s gaze. Was it is necessary to stare at the little slut for such a long time?

She is young and does not understand rules. Just a few days ago because of some things, she was forbidden to leave for a long time. With great difficulty she was finally allowed out. Please do not bicker with her.\u201dShe looked very generous, but failed to mention what happened exactly.Although did she not say, the Manor Madam had spread some rumours a couple of days ago. When she visited the Royal Palace, she had spread the news of her niece attempting to hang herself after it was discovered that she had been meeting with a man. This news naturally reached the Crown Prince\u2019s ears as well.His fine pair of eyebrows immediately wrinkled.The thought of this little girl offending public morals, and maybe losing her virtue had caused bursts of nausea to erupt from his heart. The previous throbs instantly vanished.Why did he waste so much time looking at this low levelled thing? He was bewitched!It was still Bai Ruo Qi, a talented, beautiful and gentle woman who was worthy of him!Thinking of this, the Crown Prince gaze turned into a look of disgust.\u201cLooks like Third Young Miss Bai did not reflect when you were under house arrest. Still so arrogant and despotic! This auction is not a place where you should come! Someone come and take Third Young Miss Bai back to Wu Wei Manor. Let Wu Wei Manor properly discipline her!\u201dFrom behind the Crown Prince, out stepped two black armored guards. Taking a few steps, they stopped in front of Huang Yue Li.Halting her steps, Huang Yue Li turned back to the smiled at the two.\u201cSo interesting.

Also refusing to admit your wrongs?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Huang Yue Li innocently blinked, \u201cI merely spoke some words with a stranger and it became a scandal. Second Sister and the Crown Prince has no engagement, but are close enough to go shopping together. You also rode in the same horse carriage. What would that indicate? Male adulterer****? Catching a couple in the act?\u201dWithin the onlookers, there were many young girls who were jealous of Bai Ruo Qi. When they heard those words, they began to discuss secretly amongst themselves.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The official choosing of the Imperial Concubine has yet to occur. But Bai Ruo Qi is already shopping together with the Crown Prince. Really too shameless!\u201d\u201cYes, in the end there is still no Royal Decree. Coming out together like that, losing oneself like that!\u201d\u201cIf the Emperor does not choose her as the Imperial Concubine, and she still continues to be intimate with the Crown Prince, who would dare to marry her?\u201dBai Ruo Qi\u2019s face became very red.\u201cYou\u2026what did you say? Venomous slander! I and His Royal Highness the Crown Prince are just friends. On what basis can you say we are male adulterer****? You shameless slut\u2026\u2026\u201dBai Ruo Qi almost exposed herself. Regaining control of herself, she swallowed back the vulgar words.At the same time, she looked at the Crown Prince with some apprehension.She was hoping her sudden loss of self didn\u2019t make the Crown Prince disgusted. Creating loathing towards her.Fortunately, this time, the Crown Prince was quite angered. He did not have the time to bother with her.His eyes fell on Huang Yue Li and sneered: \u201cGood!

I will teach her a lesson for you!\u201dBai Ruo Qi exposed a successful smile.Huang Yue Li laughed, \u201cThousand Treasure Pavilion\u2019s rules do not allow for guests to cause problems within its vicinity. Crown Prince must you absolutely make your move here?\u201dThe Crown Prince laughed: \u201cThis is South Yue\u2019s land, this Royal\u2019s words, who dares to object? Not mentioning Thousand Treasure Pavilion, if I wished to demolish Thousand Treasure Pavilion, the owner would not dare to say a word!\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dHuang Yue Li was smiling widely, while she secretly reached for the weapon hidden within her clothes.The guards around the Crown Prince were at the Defensive Profound Realm. In South Yue, they were considered powerful. They were a few levels higher than the guards in Wu Wei Manor.Although the secret weapon within her hands had no problem in dealing with a few practitioners at the Defensive Profound Realm, her body still possessed no profound qi. Control of the Profound Armament\u2019s power would be limited. She must be prudent.She would not attack recklessly. But when she did, it will strike!When the guards heard the order, they approached her, \u201cThird Young Miss Bai, please! You are noble born lady, we do not wish to be rough with you.\u201dAs the guards said this, their eyes revealed their disdain.The name of the Bai Family\u2019s good-for-nothing Third Young Miss had long spread throughout the entire country of South Yue. They did not believe she held any chance of resisting.So what is she was a Marquis\u2019 daughter? Where is her powerful father currently? With no cultivational talent, in front the Crown Prince, she couldn\u2019t even measure to one of them, Defensive Profound Realm Imperial Guards!Huang Yue Li sneered internally. She deliberately made a panicked expression.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026what do you want to do?\u201dSeeing the approaching guards, Huang Yue Li was ready to make her move.Suddenly, a burst of violent profound qi swept past from behind her.\u2018Bang! Bang!\u2019Two loud noises came, as the two guards Defensive Profound Realm were already sent flying!Not only did they fly away, they flew in a long arc before hitting the ground far away.The surrounding crowd followed the arc of the guards with little reaction.The personal guards of the Crown Prince\u2026\u2026they were experts at the Defensive Profound Realm, Defensive Profound Realm!In South Yue, Defensive Profound Masters were one in ten thousand. Each one could receive a position and land. A existence that ordinary people looked up to!They were actually\u2026\u2026so easily\u2026\u2026\u2026sent flying?Listening to their frightful cries, the two people had fallen face first\u2026\u2026Everyone could not help but shiver, experiencing the pain alongside them\u2026\u2026At the same time, a low voice sounded coldly: \u201cYou dare to touch this Lord\u2019s woman?

While his robe sleeves and chest, were embroidered with golden cloud designs. It seemed low-key and arrogant but also contained an indescribable noble grace.His white skin was like the moonlight, a silver mask fitting on the top half of his face. But to was enough to see his angular facial contours. His jawline beautifully sculpted, thin lips pursed and with an isolated grace.Just by standing there quietly, he created an aura that could not be ignored. An imposing manner, wholly displaying his overbearing arrogance!\u201cYou\u2026\u2026who are you?\u201d The Crown Prince looked at him guarded and asked.At his first glance towards the man, he intuitively felt threatened!The man coldly hooked his mouth. Sweeping a glance to Huang Yue Li, he said: \u201cHer man, did you not hear?\u201dThree black lines appeared on Huang Yue Li\u2019s forehead. Spinning around, she fiercely glared at the man.\u201cHey! Enough, can you not speak nonsense? When did you become my man? These kinds of words, can you announce it so randomly? I have no relationship with you!\u201dThe man chuckled out loud: \u201cWhat does it matter? If you speak like this, it makes this Lord too heartbroken\u2026\u2026\u2026for we have an intimate relationship\u2026\u2026a business relationship.\u201dWhen he said those words, he only whispered the last three words. Only Huang Yue Li could hear them.While the passer bys who were listening to the conversation, only heard the words \u2018intimate relationship\u2019.For a time, all kinds of amazed expression were seen in their eyes as they stared at the two.\u201cMy lord! What is this? So the scandal Third Young Miss Bai had was true? The male in question has also appeared?\u201d People exclaimed.\u201cSilence!\u201d One of her companion\u2019s hurriedly placed their hand on her mouth, \u201cWith this man\u2019s imposing aura, his cultivation is probably higher than the Crown Prince\u2019s! This kind of person\u2026\u2026can you afford to offend? It\u2019s best if we quickly leave!\u201d\u201cWhen did South Yue possess such a strong person? Could he have come from another country for the auction? Do you think he will starting a fight with the Crown Prince?\u201dThe young girl who just recently held a lovestruck expression for the Crown Prince, had already turned her gaze towards that man. Furthermore, she completely ignored the Crown Prince standing too far away.It was like she had forgotten she was just recently smitten by the Crown Prince\u2019s appearance.\u201cHow can that be? South Yue still has such a handsome and dashing young man?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. And he is really\u2026\u2026\u2026so strong\u2026\u2026\u2026His Highness the Crown Prince is not his match right?\u201dA variety of opinions arose, while the Crown Prince\u2019s face turned darker and darker.As the Crown Prince of South Yue and the number one genius, he was born with dignity and strength. Complemented with his handsome appearance, he thought quite highly of himself. He felt that no man could compare to him!But the man beside Huang Yue Li, just exposed half of his face. And that half was enough to show to everyone, regardless of looks or temperament he was hundred times better than himself!Furthermore, that domineeringly almost suffocating aura from his body clearly displayed that he was many times stronger too!Compared to him, he was as small as an ant!You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He also said\u2026\u2026\u2026that trash \u2026was his woman?Clenching his teeth, the Crown Prince resentfully swept his eyes over the pair.The man was quite tall and handsome. With a strong pair of unfathomable eyes; the girl who stood beside though shorter than him by a head, only had a delicate appearance. Yet she possessed a unsulliable atmosphere about her, light and graceful as the clouds.When this pair stood together, they seemed to complement each other well. Like a match made in heaven.Moreover, they completely suppressed the Crown Prince and Bai Ruo Qi!The Crown Prince bit his teeth and said: \u201cMay I dare ask for your family name?\u201dThe man looked at him indifferently, \u201cJust by you? You do not have the qualifications of learning his Lord\u2019s name!\u201dThe Crown Prince had never suffered such loathing from someone before. He nearly aged drastically from anger!As he gazed at the mysterious man, his tone turned a bit harsh.\u201cThis distinguished one should know that this is South Yue\u2019s territory, while this one is South Yue\u2019s Crown Prince! Though your cultivation is indeed very high, but a dragon should not provoke snake in its territory.

The man would be so dismissive of the distinguished title he was most proud of. But also told him to get lost!He nearly shattered his teeth, \u201cDistinguished guest, why must you be so blunt, do you not think it is a bit excessive? Though South Yue may be small it still has hidden masters. Must you force things to the point of no return?\u201dPrince was aware that he was definitely not the man\u2019s opponent, but he could not tuck in his tail and escape. He especially could not do this in front of the citizens of South Yue who respected him so much.This face\u2026\u2026he can not afford to lose!Furthermore, the fact that he had come to participate in this Third Levelled Profound Armament auction, indicated he came from a nearby third levelled power at most.Though South Yue was a small country, it still had an ancestor at the fourth realm. He had always resided in the palace. If this man was not stupid, he should be afraid of the consequences. Would he really dare to bully the country\u2019s Crown Prince?However, the Crown Prince still predicted wrongly!The mysterious man did not put him in his eyes at all. The aura his released only increased!The suppressive aura released by someone more powerful was hard to resist.Bai Ruo Qi immediately spat out a mouthful of blood. Face pale, she fell to the ground.While the Crown Prince used a skill in hopes of defending himself. But the mysterious man\u2019s suppressive might was as heavy as Mount Tai. Layer by layer is descended, the difference between their strengths was as large at the distance between the earth and sky!Face flushed, it took all of the Crown Prince\u2019s perseverance not to kneel. But he still took steps backwards!One step! Two steps! Three steps!\u2026\u2026After placing a distance of about ten feet between them, did his face resume a more normal hue. His footsteps stopped then.Only then did the mysterious man restrain his aura.He did not give the Crown Prince a second glance, but turned directly towards Huang Yue Li. His gaze filled with surprise and appreciation!He had easily suppressed South Yue\u2019s acclaimed genius.

The Crown Prince did not think that he wouldn\u2019t be able to put up any resistance in front of him!He could not swallow it, but had no choice but to swallow it!After a while, he gradually calmed down. Standing up straight, his expression still indifferent.Because Bai Ruo Qi could not bear that man\u2019s suppression and vomited out blood, it was only now that she regained conscious. She could barely move as she stood up from the ground.She bitterly looked at Huang Yue Li\u2019s backview.

But every year he would fail!This year was his last chance. If he could not become an official disciple of Celestial Light Sect, he must graduate from Celestial Light School.Once he left Celestial Light School with its rich resources and strength, he could only return to a tiny South Yue to cultivate.

If I wronged this Lord\u2019s Madam, it would be highly distressing\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dPolish! Those three phrases will not produce ivory!Huang Yue Li stared at him, too lazy to refute him. This man\u2019s skin was too thick. She did not want to waste her saliva!Watching her actions, a ghost of smile once again appeared on the man\u2019s face. Inching closer to her, his slender fingers picked up a crystal jujube cake and brought it to her mouth.\u201cLittle girl, we rode all morning. Are you hungry? Eat some snacks?\u201dA moment of carelessness, the man once again closed up to her.Without any politeness, Huang Yue Li bluntly said: \u201cStay away from me. I am not used to \u2026\u2026omph!\u201dShe was not able to finish her sentence, her mouth stuffed with pastries; nearly choking. Puffing out her cheeks, she vigorously chewed the pastries. Her bright pair of eyes glaring at the man.It was during that moment a burst of noise erupted from the ground floor seats.Hurriedly, the man pointed to something behind her: \u201cQuickly look! The cheap fiance has appeared!\u201dOriginally, Huang Yue Li had already withdrew a handful of flying needles. She intended to teach this man a lesson for wanting a mile after giving him an inch. When she heard his cry, she stopped her movements and turned.Downstairs, the Crown Prince sullenly sat down in the general seating. His body releasing enough pressure to freeze someone to death!As for the one who assumed she would be the future Imperial concubine, the arrogant and prideful Bai Ruo Qi was covered dirt. Her clothes disorderly, her entire body trembled as she followed the Crown Prince. She feared that he would burst out in anger.\u201cTsk tsk. Really a match made in heaven!\u201d Propping her chin, Huang Yue Li beamed.The Owner chuckled beside her and wiped of the residue pastries from the side of her mouth.But immediately withdrew his hand when her expression changed: \u201cThis Lord does not understand. Since you are so nauseated by them, why do you still allow them to enter the auction? You tell them to get lost and not continue to feel disgusted from seeing them. That would be good!\u201d\u201cHeh!\u201d Huang Yue Li gave him a side glance: \u201cHow can here be such a convenient thing?For the ones who dare bully me, if I don\u2019t extort all the money they own, I will change my surname to yours!\u201dYou can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 \u2014 The auction beginsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySinisterly, Huang Yue Li grinned towards the Crown Prince and Bai Ruo Qi. Her gaze was daggers, butchering away the meat infront of her. Her drool practically falling from her mouth.When the man saw her impressive expression, he couldn\u2019t help but shake his head in amusement.This little fox\u2026\u2026\u2026was fiercer than himself! Stingier than him!Really pitied those two blind people for offending her. Even if they didn\u2019t die, they would lose a layer of skin!Furthermore, why did he find her cunning appearance so adorable?These two people sat leisurely in the private room. One was high spirited, looking down below and calculating how to earn the best profit from cheating others. While the other was raptly focused on the female beside him wondering how to please her.This scene looked very harmonious and beautiful\u2026\u2026\u2026Shortly afterwards, the ordinary seats were all filled. There were a total of one thousand seats, each one occupied while the doors were crowded with people who failed to obtain tickets.A scholarly and refined middle-aged man walked onto the auction stage.He was not someone unknown, but Thousand Treasure Pavilion\u2019s very own Shopkeeper Sun. He was a well known person in South Yue.With his appearance the clamouring also quieted down.An auction like this, that had attracted the attention of so many was finally beginning!\u201cDear fellow guests, I welcome you all to Thousand Treasure Pavilion\u2019s annual auction! As you all may know, each and every year Thousand Treasure Pavilion would present all sorts of rare and valuable treasures, never disappointing the masses. This year\u2026\u2026\u2026also won\u2019t fail to meet your expectations! \u201d\u201cOn the contrary, many of you may have already via your own methods have some knowledge towards some items on sale this year. I am able to inform everyone, apart from the information we have revealed, we still have many surprises for you all! Please look forward to it!\u201dThough Shopkeeper Sun\u2019s cultivation may not be high, he was very shrewd in business. With a few words, he had heated up the overall mood of the entire venue.While the gazes of the guests below, became blazing.\u201cShopkeeper Sun, don\u2019t waste words and quickly start the auction!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Your words cannot prove much. Whatever goods you have, hurry up and bring them out for us to see!\u201dThere were a few people who impatiently called out.Shopkeeper Sun merely chuckled: \u201cIt seems that everyone here is itching for the auction to start. Then this one will not longer delay. This auction shall officially start!\u201dA maid steadily walked on stage.In her hands was a covered silver tray. A red silk cloth was hiding the contents on that silver tray, blocking all vision towards the concealed good.Lightly, Shopkeeper Sun lifted up the cloth to reveal a long scroll.\u201cThe first item in for sale is a Yellow Level Upper Grade Profound Skill\u2014\u2014Golden Yuan Finger! This Yellow Level Upper Grade scroll\u2019s rarity should be be known by everyone. What is worth mentioning is the paralysing effect of the Golden Yuan Finger. Enemies struck by this skill will lose all mobility within three breaths. Of course, if the opponent\u2019s cultivation is greater then your own, then its effects will be greatly reduced.\u201d\u201cMoreover, this Profound Skill also has a restriction. This skill can only be learnt by those who metal attributed practitioners!\u201dSmilingly, Shopkeeper Sun briefly introduced the item: \u201cThis Profound Skill\u2019s starting price is\u2026\u2026ten thousand silvers! I ask distinguished guests to begin their bids!\u201dIt was actually a Yellow Level Upper Grade Profound Skill!No one would have imagined that the auction held by Thousand Treasure Pavilion this would be this impressive. The first item available was a Yellow Level Upper Grade Profound Skill! It also carried a special skill; ten times more valuable than an ordinary skill of the same level!You can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 \u2014 Spirit Raising PillPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOne had to know that the cultivational standards of South Yue and its surrounding countries was not that high. Even a long standing martial family like the Bai Family only possessed two Yellow Level Upper Grade profound skills!In an instant, everyone was stirred to great agitation.As Shopkeeper Sun was introducing on the stage, there were already several guests who were itching to bid.Just the words left his mouth, someone had already placed the first bid.\u201cTwelve thousand silvers!\u201d\u201cFifteen thousand silvers!\u201d\u201cSixteen thousand silvers!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cThirty thousand!\u201dRapidly, the price of the scroll soared up. Reaching the thirty thousand threshold.On the third floor, Huang Yue Li shook her head in response to the fiery reactions of the crown below.The resources of South Yue were just too appaling. It was only a Yellow Level profound skill and could still cause such a clamour. One should know that the cultivation technique she had imparted to Cai Wei were Black Level Upper Grade.Furthermore, cultivation manuals were a hundred times more valuable than profound skills!While the man had not so much glanced at the auctioned. All his attention was focused on the little fox. Watching her shake her head, a soft smile formed.The frenzy continued on for a bit, with the final price settling down at fifty thousand silvers.This price did not exceed Huang Yue Li\u2019s expectations as this profound skill\u2019s paralysing effect was quite good. But it only allowed metal attributed people to cultivate, severely cutting its value.Those participating in this round are all families who possess metal attributed talents. This determined that the price would not go too high.However, with the first product already sold at fifty thousand silvers, in the history of this Thousand Treasure Pavilion this was a first.This indicated that the remaining portion of the auction will be exciting!As predicted, the items taken out began more and more precious. While the prices also rose to more stunning degrees and the moods of the guests below became more and more fervent.Under the expectedly gazes of the guests, Shopkeeper Sun pulled off another silk cloth from the silver tray.This time, a small porcelain bottle stood in the centre of the tray. It was about half the size of a palm, nothing too outstanding.But the guests below the stage were once again aroused.The reason being that only cultivational pills were stored in these porcelain bottles. This ensured that the medicinal properties of the pills would not be lost or dissipate. Unfortunately the manufacturing costs of these type of bottle were too high, and only precious pills would be normally in such bottles.Following, Shopkeeper Sun\u2019s beaming smiling unravelled the mystery.\u201cEsteemed guests, stored within this little bottle are Second Level Middle Grade Pills\u2014\u2014Spirit Raising Pills!\u201d\u201cSpirit Raising Pills! It\u2019s actually Spirit Raising Pills!\u201d\u201cIt is said that the ingredients needed in producing these Spirit Raising Pills are very hard to find. The pill formation rate is also very low, so it would already be very good for ordinary Second Tiered Alchemists to refine one or two pills from ten tries!\u201dListening to the discussions below the stage, Shopkeeper Sun stroked his beard beaming.\u201cThat is correct. Esteemed guests you are people who can recognise a product\u2019s value. Towards cultivators, the Spirit Raising Pill is a rare and valuable item. For practitioners at the Qi Profound Realm, they would directly be able to increase their cultivations by one to three levels. Even ordinary people who are unable to cultivate, if you take ten or more of these pills, you will also be able to step into the ranks of martial practitioners.\u201dPausing momentarily, he continued: \u201cBut the most important part of the Spirit Raising Pills are their ability to allow Qi Profound Ninth Level practitioners to breakthrough to the Defensive Profound Realm. It is well known that Defensive Profound Realm is the first bottleneck for any practitioner. A great majority of cultivators are unable to pass this wall, stopping forever at the ninth level of the Qi Profound Realm. Countless of cultivational talents, because of this bottleneck, wasted great amounts of time and their own potential.\u201d\u201cNow, if you are able to obtain this bottle of Spirit Raising Pills, that problem will no longer be a problem!\u201dYou can also listen onPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
