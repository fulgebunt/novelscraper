    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 MarriageIn the 20th year of Yuansheng, the fifteenth day of the first lunar month was the Lantern Festival.The annual Lantern Festival was being held on the main street of Yunsheng. It was rare for the common people to have a family reunion and took their families out to play.The lantern riddle stalls on the bustling streets, there were jugglers, sugar sellers, glutinous rice balls stalls, and laughter and shouts from the lively restaurants. Everything was simple. Everyone was with contented face, but all this had nothing to do with what was happening at the deserted and bloody East City Gate.A carriage with a carriage used by ordinary people fell to the ground and fell to pieces. It was almost difficult to see its original appearance. The horse pulling the carriage had been shot by a poisonous arrow and fell to the ground and howled lowly.Not far away, forty or fifty people in black were holding bows and arrows, one arrow shot mercilessly at the man in prison clothes who fell on the ground. His back was filled with arrows and his mouth was full of blood, but his eyes were firm and he embraced with the last of his strength. He tightly held the white-clothed man with a pale face in his arms, and the white-clothed man was still holding a stiff and breathless baby in his arms.The man in in prison clothes spit black blood from his mouth: \"I'm sorry, Luo Shuyu, next life you have to stay away from me, don't let me implicate you.\"The white man with cold purple lips, he leaned to the man in prison clothes's arms, was hit with the deep cold winter wind had long been unable to erode half of his body.\"You are not sorry for me.\" The man in white covered his mouth with his hand, trying to make him vomit less blood, but his eyes were desperate, \"We can go out.\"The man in prison clothes felt his eyelids fall down. The only thing he could face was death: \"There are a lot of words, I want to tell you, but unfortunately there is no time.\"Another arrow shot into his back, and the arrow pierced his heart fiercely, \"Luo Shuyu, you must leave in the next life, far away from me...\"The man in white put his arms around him and called his name sternly, tears streaming down: \"Li Mingjin! Don't die! Don't die! What should I do if you die!\"Li Mingjin raised his hand and stroked his cheek \"Don't...cry...can...not...cry...\"Before his fingers wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes, he was no longer had energy \u00a0fell into Luo Shuyu's arms covered in blood.\"I don't cry, I don't cry.\"From the day when Luo Shuyu received the imperial decree of marriage, he knew that his fate was tied to the third prince Li Mingjin. He didn't understand why the third prince chose him. He had always been puzzled by the reason for this. Perhaps the family sacrificed him in exchange for the future of his father and brothers, or his horoscope coincided with the third prince, but no matter what the reason, he couldn't laugh at it.No one in the whole Shangjing didn't know that the third prince was paranoid and violent. There were countless eunuchs and maids who died in his hands. He liked to hold whips in his hands. Whenever he saw anyone was not pleasing to the eyes, he would whipped them. They all knew that he was not a good match. Luo Shuyu was the son of the Luo family. When Luo Shuyu married, the whole city betting him being beaten the next day as a joke. However, after three years of marriage, Luo Shuyu was still safe and sound. Li Mingjin acted licentiously, but never moved his finger.Later, he and Li Mingjin had a real husbandand wife's relationship. In an accident, he became pregnant and gave birth to a son for him. One month after the child was born, Li Mingjin was sent to prison for collaborating with the enemy. His father who also the emperor were unwilling to save him, and the family lost their lives.If Luo Shuyu became ignorant after death, he may be a ray of wronged soul, and he would go straight to reincarnation, reincarnated as an adult, and accepted the tragic fate of his previous life.But he had not gone to reincarnation yet. As a ray of soul, he entered a square white room and got a book called \"After Transmigrating Into A Book, Four Big Brothers Are Fighting to Marry Me\", Luo Shuyu only thought the name of the book was quite strange, and he turned to the first page of the book.The full text of the book was about 800,000 words. Luo Shuyu became more and more angry when he read it. After reading it, his entire soul became more and more transparent due to anger. The tragic fate he (protagonist) had caused was not worth mentioning in the eyes of the protagonist. Both he and Li Mingjin did not live half of the overall content of the novel.Thinking of his one-month-old child dying in the cold winter and Li Mingjin, who was finally covered with blood fell in his arms, his soul seemed to be torn by countless thin threads, causing him pain, and he was crazy. Weeping and crying, but did not shed half a tear.It turned out that they were just worthless characters in the book. They couldn't control their own destiny at all. They were just a stepping stone for the promotion of the protagonist in the book. Death was not a pity.But what did he do wrong?What did his poor baby do wrong?Was Li Mingjin really colliding with the enemy?He knew that those letters about collided with the enemy were forged, and that was not Li Mingjin's handwriting at all!.However, they were just the characters in the book, an undeniable fact.There was resentment in Luo Shuyu's heart, and his soul was flickering, and he hated it! He hated it! He hated it!He wanted those who ruined his child's life to be buried with him! he couldn\u2019t wait to eat their meat, drunk their blood, cramped their muscles, thwarted their bones and grasped their ashes!He was immersed in resentment and did not notice that the space he was staying in was being distorted.In the blink of an eye, the space turned into a small black spot, and then disappeared.In the west courtyard of Luofu, cicadas and birds screamed in summer, and a young man slept soundly on a deck chair under the tree with a book on his chest.\"Young Master, Young Master, wake up, wake up!\"Someone was talking, shaking his shoulders gently.The sound in his ear made him who was taking a nap...Nap? Wasn't he dead? Wasn't he reading a strange book?Luo Shuyu suddenly opened his eyes and saw a familiar and immature face. This was Qingwang, who was only sixteen or seventeen.Qingwang\u2019s characteristic was his skin was a bit dark, he was full of joy and anger, everything was written on his face. During the years when he entered the Third Princes\u2019 Mansion, because he was not favored as the master, Qingwang began to become less talkative. Growing up in the lately, in the mansion, he would always speak out to protect him.But, wasn't he dead? How could he still see Qingwang.He still remembered the officers and soldiers who came to the third prince's mansion to take people, all of them were very rude. Qingwang stepped forward to stop him and was injured on the spot. After that, he went to jail and asked to bring food to the jailer, but was killed by the jailer who drank alcohol. When he died, he was still holding a dirty steamed bun in his hand.Seeing the young man around him still alive vividly, Luo Shuyu was in a trance, until Qingwang's inviting voice shouted: \"Son, something went wrong.\"( gong zhi = son, here just a title for son of an official or son of nobility)Luo Shuyu heard Qingwang's roar and was awake, opened his eyes, he reached in the face of Qingwang and pinched it: \" Does it hurt?\"Qingwang wrinkled his cheeky face, approached Luo Shuyu, so that he could relieve the pinch, \"Master, son, it hurts, what did Qingwang do wrong, you want to pinch me hard?.\"Luo Shuyu shook his head, wondering whether the things in his memory were a dream or something else. For a while, he was a little confused. If it was true, then he was now borrowing a corpse to return to life?But he had only heard that the resurrection was in other people's body, but what he was now was returning to his own body, Qingwang was still so young.Qingwang, who was let go, began to be anxious again: \"My son, the big thing is really bad!\"Luo Shuyu calmed down and asked him: \"What big thing is bad? How decent is flustered like this?, let the mistress see and get hit with the board, I won\u2019t speak for you.\u201dQingwang quickly admitted his mistake: \u201cthe little one know that he was wrong, but things are really urgent. I just heard the master and his wife said that the emperor wants to marry you and the third prince!\u201d he was finally could tell what he had inquired about, and he was so anxious, how could the son be in no rush to do something!Luo Shuyu frowned: \"Gift marriage?\"This was the second time he heard these two words, but his heart was slightly shaken, but there was no resistance, grievance, full unwillingness and final compromise of the last time.And when he heard the third prince, he was stunned.What appeared in front of him was the picture of Li Mingjin being pierced by the arrow, and the sentence he repeatedly emphasized before he died.\"Luo Shuyu, you must stay away from me in your next life...\"He used to think that Li Mingjin had no feelings for him. They were married for many years but never had a room. The only time Li Mingjin accidentally took medicine, and then got him for one night. The memory of that night was still deep, Li Mingjin was very gentle. Afterwards, he helped him clean up, took him to the bath, and never really hurt him from the beginning to the end.How could a person who gave up his life to protect you from a knife and an arrow had no feelings for you?Perhaps he had been immersed in sad emotions, he had never asked Li Mingjin why he wanted to marry him, so many women and sons in the world he could choose, why chose him alone.Daxia Kingdom was divided into three types of people, men, women, and gers.(actually this novel uses the word gongzhi (son) again as the third gender, but I think it will be confusing since the servants call their master \"son\" and people talk about the third gender also use \"son\")The ger was between a man and a woman, had fertility, but the fertility was lower than that of a woman, and it was not easy to conceive. A family that needed heirs to inherit the family would not find a son as the mother of the family, and mostly would choose a woman as the wife.The ger's status in the Daxia Kingdom was not high, even the married man had never selected a ger as the first wife. However, the state of Daxia today was different from the past. The harem of the saint now had a ger who had been promoted to the concubine, and he could please the saint so his status had improved.Just after receiving the news, the butler suddenly ran to inform Luo Shuyu to go to the front hall to meet the imperial decree.Luo Shuyu put on a dress under Qingwang's reminder. He didn't expect that the imperial decree came so quickly, just like in his previous life, there was no time for him to prepare in his heart.Now, it was not needed anymore.There were a lot of people in the front hall. His father Luo Renshou, the mistress of the house, the old lady who was over 60 years old, and the brothers and sisters at home all came out.The Luo family was more complicated. Luo Shuyu was a direct son, but his mother surename Chen passed away due to illness in the early years. The current mistress was Liu, who had been with Luo Renshou for many years. One year after Chen's death, Liu's was promoted to be his full wife. She had two sons, a daughter and a ger under her knees. She was very spoiled, and even the old lady had to give her a bit of face.Although Luo Shuyu didn't receive much attention from his father in the family, he was a ger as a direct son, and he could survive if he was a little tighter on weekdays.Sitting on the grandmaster's chair in the main hall was a Hou Ye, and an old eunuch holding the imperial decree followed by his side.(Hou Ye = marquis, second of the five orders of ancient Chinese nobility; nobleman or high official)Luo Renshou was talking politely with Wen Changhou.Wen Changhou was a few years older, with sharp eyes, he got up when he heard someone called \"The Third Young Master is coming\" and said to Luo Renshou: \"Luo Shangshu, let's start proclaiming the imperial decree.\"Luo Renshou raised his hand and said respectfully. \"Hou Ye, please.\"Wen Changhou waited for the Luo family to kneel down and began to read the imperial decree.\"Luo Shuyu took the order.\"Luo Shuyu knelt down and took the order, with a dignified posture, neither arrogant nor humble. Wen Changhou glanced at it and felt that he was a good boy. It was a pity that this appearance, this manner, was allocated to the third prince.\"Feng Tian carries the emperor, and the edict said: I heard that Luo Shuyu, the son of Luo Renshou, an officer from the Ministry of Rites, was dignified and generous, gentle and honest, and excellent in appearance. The queen mother and I were very happy to choose such a virtuous son and match him. Luo Shuyu who waits in his boudoir and the third son of the emperor can be said to be created by heaven and earth, for the beauty of being a beautiful woman, I will match him with the third son of the emperor as the princess. We are working together to get married on a good day.\"(Febg Tian = the old name of shengyan, the capital name of a province)Luo Shuyu listened to the imperial decree, and his heart drifted far away.Li Mingjin, I, Luo Shuyu, will never abandon you in this life.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 Asking for dowryWen Changhou who read the imperial decree and the eunuch who accompanied him were sent away, and the Luo family returned to the atmosphere of the past.The old lady was helped up, and she also had her maid. The maid served the tea to the host family. As soon as she came down, everyone had light on their faces and looked for their own positions. The old lady and Luo Renshou sat in the main seat, Liu sat next to Luo Renshou as the head ofthe family, while the other juniors sat down in their respective positions.As a child, Luo Shuyu didn't get much love from Luo Renshou, and even a little alienated. His attitude also affected the degree of care of the old lady for him.Perhaps Luo Shuyu in the previous life cared too much about family affection, and always made excuses for Luo Renshou\u2019s alienation. Only when he was needed, Luo Renshou would show a fatherly appearance and pretended to care for him a few words. When he thought about it, it was to use him to get the news of the Third Prince's Mansion.In the early years, Luo Shuyu also wanted to get close to Luo Renshou. After all, he was his biological father and the only person he could rely on in this world. But after experiencing all these things, Luo Shuyu turned around and looked at Luo Renshou again. He was just a villain who had forgotten the justice. He didn't like his mother, but was coveting the benefits that his mother's family could bring him, so he married her back then. When he was with his mother, he was only a sixth-rank little official. To put it bluntly, because of his mother's natal family he had come to his current position. Not only did he forget righteousness, but he avoided it after the accident in his mother's family. No wonder their Luo family had never been in contact with the Chen family in these years.Looking at the people he used to think to be relatives, each of them seemed to be kind and gentle like a bodhisattva, but in fact they were all abominable, and Luo Shuyu only felt chills.He now clearly remembered that after he and the third prince were imprisoned, Luo Renshou never saw him in the jail. He used a piece of Jade left by his mother to find his biological father (LRS) to save his child. However, Luo Renshou left him only one sentence: life and death have fate, wealth is in heaven, fate is sometimes necessary, and fate is always indispensable.With a pun, he wouldn\u2019t save anyone. Self-preservation was important. Maybe it was not self-preservation. Maybe he personally presented and fabricated the evidence with both hands.Luo Shuyu really hated this father who was known as \"gentle and humble\". The imperial decree he was holding at the moment was no longer heavy. In his previous life, he felt that this imperial decree was disaster for his life, but in this life it was his life-saving talisman. The guarantee for his future.In his previous life, he believed too much in his human-faced and beast-hearted father, he had never doubted since he had a father-son relationship with him, and he was blindfolded.The more he thought about it, the more he felt that he was so stupid. His father occasionally gave him a little affection like father and son, so he revealed to him all of his affairs in the Third Prince's Mansion. Now he had to suspect that the matter the third prince had collusion with enemy had a lot to do with his father.Thinking of this, Luo Renshou just raised his old smile like a loving father to Luo Shuyu : \"Shu Yu, from now on, you have to prepare for the marriage in the yard these days. Don't worry about anything else, there is a father for you to call the shots.\"Luo Shuyu wondered how he could not see his father\u2019s indifference to him, if he still had a little affection for him, how could he be indifferent to him? He had been in the Luo family for many years, and as a son of a main wife, he should live well. It was better for a little son backed by his aunt, let alone a son from the Liu family, what else did he want?He only hated the stupidity and ridiculousness of himself, which was the kind of family affection he insisted on, it was a joke.Luo Shuyu endured his nausea and gave Luo Renshou a straight punch: \"Father, since I am going to marry the third prince, I can't let the prince lose face. I don't think about anything else. I want to count my mother's dowry. I also hope that my father can give me the key to my mother\u2019s dowry storeroom in time.\u201dHis mother married Luo Renshou with many treasure things. Chen was the official lady of the capital and was also a \u00a0young talents in Beijing. The married talented woman was later lost the Chen family as her backer due to an incident. Not long after his mother passed away due to illness, no one mentioned the dowry. In his previous life, he married into the royal family. Luo Renshou did not know whether he was intentionally or unintentionally. He never mentioned it to him. Once at a banquet, he saw his married fourth brother wearing a sable robe. Someone praised him and was very pushy. A woman sitting next to him mentioned his mother and said that she had had a robe like this in the past. He realized that there was something strange, but unfortunately he was not clear at the time and didn't delve into it.At this time, Liu Shi heard the word dowry, and his eyes swept towards Luo Renshou.Luo Renshou was also taken aback on the spot, his heart was shaken, he didn't understand how Luo Shuyu suddenly mentioned the dowry of his deceased wife, how could he think of it.Luo Renshou thought that Luo Shuyu was still a son who was the same as before, and was very good to coax. He wanted to draw a little affection from his father. He had a smile on his face and wanted to take the initiative in his own hands. He said: \"Your mother's dowry is natural. It\u2019s good. Why do you start to worry about it before you get married. In the future, you will be the princess of the third prince. It is said that I have no way to teach you as a children\"Luo Shuyu has experienced life and death, and he was not afraid of Luo Renshou's moral suppression. He remembered that Shen Mingyun said in the book that this was called moral kidnapping.Luo Renshou taught him? Luo Shuyu even wanted to sneer in front of him, poking his face.Master Shang Shu, who had been in the court all the year round, understood the behavior of the third prince. As a father, watching his child enter the Longtan Tiger Den, he actually laughed like this without worrying at all.(shang shu = high official)How could he be generous? Would you give up your own life again? went to the Third Prince's Mansion as a spy for them, so as to pave the way for the Luo family?This was Luo Renshou. He was a \"loving father\" who had used him up all the way until he became wasted.Now, for Luo Shuyu, the house of the Third Prince was not Longtan Tiger\u2019s Den, but a safe heaven for him in the future. Returning his mother\u2019s dowry was just his first step to shelter from the wind. He had to prepare for the future, regardless of whether he would experience it again in his life. Before death, he would try to change the fate of him and Li Mingjin, and changed the fate of his child.\"Father, knowledge of the general body and the abdomen is not related to my taking my mother's dowry into the Prince's Mansion. I remember my mother's last wish during her lifetime. One of them is that her dowry will be inherited by me in full, and now I am about to enter the third prince's mansion, the dowry is the confidence of our Luo family. We can't shame the royal family. I'm not doing well, and our family can't look up. Maybe someone outside will say that you have an opinion on the marriage that the saint is referring to.\" Rather than oppressing people with Luo Renshou was not good for him, it was better to use the emperor directly to oppress him. Luo Renshou cared about the disrespect of the emperor.(sorry, too much puns so I just write it like that, I don't even know what it means so how can I edit it?, at least we can still understand the plot)Luo Shuyu, who had always been obedient and well-behaved, who almost never made any resistance to Luo Renshou's words, suddenly became tough, making Luo Renshou very uncomfortable. He had a good face, and Luo Shuyu always poked at this points. The smile on his gentle face gradually faded.Luo Renshou did not know who instigated Luo Shuyu to say these things, but he did have to take care of his own face, the imperial decree was irresistible, and he could not bear the reputation of father's unkindness. He now had to appease Luo Shuyu and figured it out who was chewing the tongue in his ear, every word accusing him of invading his dead wife's dowry, his son always said something that couldn't hear a single echo in three sentences, and since when he became so eloquent.In order not to be criticized, Luo Renshou could only temporarily promise him: \"I will let someone count your mother's dowry, and then I will give you a list and add make up to you.\"If Luo Shuyu didn't mention it today, he would naturally not mention it. But since it was for this reason, he had no reason to lose his share in front of the juniors. The whole family was listening here. He doubted whether Luo Shuyu did it on purpose, which made him feel uncomfortable.Of course, Luo Shuyu did it intentionally. He went to find Luo Renshou in private, and he would sent him away with a few words, or refused to see him. He would only speak in front of everyone in order to get him agreed to his request.Liu Shi's mouth moved and wanted to say something, but the old lady who had been enjoying the maid pinching her shoulders suddenly said, \"Shu Yu, you are going to be married to the third Prince's Mansion. Don't be so petty, too tough to like. Is your father going to swallow your mother\u2019s dowry, do I speak the truth?\u201d She tossed around the beads in her hand, but what she said was contrary to the Buddha\u2019s will, and it was acrimonious, which told him not to take his mother's dowry, let Liu continued to squander it.The old lady had no culture. There were two things that she valued the most in her life. One was her most promising son, Luo Renshou, and the other was money. His son had no face in front of her grandchildren, and she didn\u2019t miss her daughter-in-law\u2019s dowry. She naturally wanted to teach Luo Shuyu a few words.Why did his mother's dowry make things awkward like this?He was very disdainful of the old lady in his heart. Luo Shuyu said indifferently: \"What my grandmother said may need to be considered. I haven't heard my father mention my mother's dowry until now. I just remind him. I also hope that some people will return what they shouldn't have .\"He was a person who had died once, was he afraid of Luo family?Liu Shi was insinuated by Luo Shuyu and wanted to say a few words, but the old lady obviously did not want her to say: \"Prepare the child well for his marriage, don't lose our face.\"This was for Liu Shi, and she didn't want to mix up. Regarding these things, she waved her hand and left, \"Okay, nothing else, I'll go back first.\"She was very happy at first, after all, they would be relatives of the emperor somehow in the future. As for the character of the third prince, it had nothing to do with her. Within the scope of her consideration, she had never been close to Luo Shuyu, but this Shuyu suddenly wanted to take his dowry, which also wiped out her interest.\"Yes, mother.\" Liu Shi's head bowed and a group of people sent the old lady to the door.Luo Renshou looked at Luo Shuyu uncomfortably, and found a reason to leave. Before leaving, he called his two eldest sons to the study to discuss the matters.Liu Shi looked at Luo Shuyu, but she didn't explain anything. She walked away with a girl in a painful expression, and the whole room almost half already walked away.The rest of juniors looked at Luo Shuyu, who was holding the imperial decree in his hand, with envy, jealousy, stupidity, and of course some disdained.The disdain was naturally from Luo Shuyao, who was favored by Liu Shi.(honestly both MC and this brother's \u00a0name are similar, that is Luo Shuyu. The difference is the \"yu\" character in MC's name means treasure;hard metal while his brother's \"yu\" means rain. To make it easier, I will call the brother Luo Shuyao)Luo Shuyao squeezed his newly hung jade pendant and said: \"Brother, you haven't married the third prince, just put an air. Those who don't know think you are already the third prince's.\"\"It's not your turn to evaluate it.\" Luo Shuyu patted his sleeve and looked at the auspicious cloud pattern cuffs without raising his eyelids.With such a casual appearance, Luo Shuyao felt offended. Thinking of something, he leaned forward and approached Luo Shuyu: \"Brother, you may not know what kind of person the third prince is. I heard that he kills people like kill a horse, the maid\u2019s corpse is often transported out of the room. As long as he looks at someone as unpleasant, he will slap them with a whip. He will be happy only if he draws the skin and flesh. In the future, you will have to ask for more blessings. \u00a0Fifth brother, you don't know anything. You, as an unmarried ger must know about other men\u2019s affairs, do not know how the father will feel when he knows about it\"Luo Shuyu responded lightly \"It's important for a woman to have a good reputation, and so is the ger.\"Luo Shuyao was caught off guard by Luo Shuyu's counterattack. He did not expect that Luo Shuyu suddenly had a talent for argumentation. He was stuck in his throat and couldn't get up. For a while, he couldn't find a word to refute it. He was so angry that he could only looking at the back of Luo Shuyu leaving chicly.\"Fourth sister, why don't you help me!\" Luo Shuyao complained to the girl sitting quietly next to him.Luo Shuyue smiled softly, and said lightly and comforted: \"What are you anxious for? After he gets married, he won't have a good life. Even if the Third Princes' Mansion is so good, can it be his turn?\"Luo Shuyao was caught. He was soothed, snorted softly, also thinking like that, why not wait to see Luo Shuyu's joke.When he returned to Ruyiyuan, Luo Shuyu was relieved. His father's attitude just chilled him, and would not affect him anymore.The grievances between Luo Shuyu and others were nothing more than whose fabrics were better and whose looks were better. He had never cared about this. What he really had to face was the protagonist in the book that could affect his destiny\u2014\u2014 Shen Mingyun.In the book, from Shen Mingyun's perspective, it was mentioned that the third prince's favorite person was Shen Mingyun, but afterwards the matter was disturbed by Shen Mingyun himself, the emperor suddenly kicked in and pointed Luo Shuyu to him.Luo Shuyu looked at the imperial edict in his hand and sighed slightly.The author has something to say: Update!Third Prince: Urgent!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 Does he really say that?In \"After Transmigrating Into A Book, Four Big Brothers Are Fighting to Marry Me\", from the beginning to the end, from the perspective of the protagonist Shen Mingyun, only when Shen Mingyun met Luo Shuyu would he had a corresponding description of him, and the number of times the two had intersected actually not many, but Shen Mingyun was obviously hostile to Luo Shuyu, and every time they got along alone, Shen Mingyun would ridicule him with a few words.The cause should be related to the failure of Luo Shuyu's grandfather's (from mother) family, and Shen Mingyun was also implicated before he joined the Luo family. Therefore, with preconceived prejudice, Shen Mingyun couldn't wait to see Luo Shuyu. After discovering that Luo Shuyu ignored him, he insulted him even more vigorously. He verbally insulted him back and forth. Luo Shuyu was taught by his mother to learn about etiquette since he was a child. He treated people with courtesy, and was not very good at quarreling and scolding. He could only be silent and ignored it. The more he behaved like this, the more Shen Mingyun scolded him for pretending to be upright and decent behind his back.After reading the book, Luo Shuyu found out that Shen Mingyun was cursing like a shrew because of his lack of knowledge, but such a person was called an unconventional and rare talent by the big guys who liked him. It was a great irony.After reading the psychological description of Shen Mingyun and his origins in the book, he learned that this person is very simple. He couldn't even write the calligraphy well but he had a fairy-like helper. Shen Mingyun called it golden finger or system, which was full of knowledge. Luo Shuyu understood this thing was like an immortal object. Otherwise, with Shen Mingyun's ability to write poorly, how could he become a man who knew astronomy and geography, read poetry, and art of war.As the male protagonist, Shen Mingyun could encounter various events wherever he went, including encountering the third prince. The process of their encounter also accounted for a large part of the early stage. Of course, there was also the future of the third prince, Li Mingjin, as the book's villain who laid the groundwork for him (SMY), and it was also the caused of his (LMJ) family's future death because of \"conspiracy\".Shen Mingyun remembered his grudges. The encounter between the third prince and him was not so beautiful. Although Shen Mingyun had always lamented Li Mingjin\u2019s good looks, he was still afraid of Li Mingjin. When Li Mingjin proposed to include him in the Prince\u2019s Mansion, Shen Mingyun was still ashamed and annoyed. He still preferred the other prince, and finally chose to give up the third prince.Luo Shuyu remembered what Shen Mingyun said the most in the book: children do multiple-choice questions, and adults want them all.He didn\u2019t chose Li Mingjin because he couldn\u2019t bear Li Mingjin\u2019s character. He felt that this person made him feel scared. He felt that his eyes would eat people. The whole person was too sinister, difficult to provoke, and violent. This was all in the book. Shen Mingyun's psychological description of Li Mingjin.Shen Mingyun came to the capital and was very curious about everything around him. Like an unfamiliar wild cat, he liked to run out all day long. The Luo family's immediate relatives couldn't control him. It was mainly because he also could provide Luo Renshou with some eclectic suggestions about the court. In the book, Shen Mingyun called it a system task. Every time he did a task, he could get a point, and then he could change it at the system shop. There were many kinds of props, one of them could make the beauty became more fascinating. Luo Shuyu understood the role of these props, he wanted to come up with a set, but he did not have a system.The encounter between Shen Mingyun and the third prince was ordinary.He rented a boat for water rafting that day and heard the sound of someone being whipped on the painting boat next door, so he got the system task prompt and immediately let Li Mingjin let go that person. His boldness caught Li Mingjin\u2019s attention, but he only got Li Mingjin\u2019s sentence: Don't be nosy.Of course Shen Mingyun refused to leave, he yelled that there was no Wang Fa in the world. Li Mingjin asked someone to tie him onto the boat and blocked his mouth. Shen Mingyun felt that he had been molested by Li Mingjin.But in the end, Shen Mingyun was released because the arrival of the Fourth Prince who came to rescue him.After that, Shen Mingyun who could meet Li Mingjin several times began to feel that Li Mingjin liked him, otherwise why would he show up where he went many times. After meeting many times, several princes gathered together in a restaurant. There was a young master who molested Shen Mingyun, and Li Mingjin rescued him. Didn't know which prince teased Li Mingjin and then there was a rumor that he wanted to marry Shen Mingyun.Shen Mingyun heard that Li Mingjin actually liked him and wanted to accept him as a concubine. As a man, he certainly refused.Yes, Shen Mingyun was originally a real man, not a ger, and the same kind of person as the man of this world.In order to solve this problem, when the imperial concubine went to the imperial temple to offer incense, he specially asked the old monk who owed him a favor to go to a certain imperial concubine and said that he and Luo Shuyu were a \"natural pair\".He didn't want to enter the Third Prince's Mansion. No one in the entire capital didn't know how brutal and bloodthirsty the Third Prince was. He often went out, and he would find out after a little inquiries. Didn't it mean that entering the Third Prince's Mansion was the same as entering tiger's mouth? He would never go, life or death!After that, Luo Shuyu was forced to take over the imperial decree to enter the Third Princes' Mansion for Shen Mingyun. And now Luo Shuyu happened to be reborn on the day of receiving the imperial decree.Luo Shuyu placed the bright yellow imperial edict lightly on the table. His fingers were squeezed white, and he realized that there was some pain before letting go. Thinking of the words Li Mingjin told him before his death, and the unsurviving child he regarded as a treasure, he felt pain in his heart.Qingwang stood behind Luo Shuyu and watched his complexion changed. He was in a complicated mood. Why did the son who had always looked so plain suddenly looked so sad?\"My son, do you miss madam?\"Luo Shuyu took a deep breath, patted his cheeks with both hands, shook his head and said, \"Go and open the window for some ventilation.\"\"Yes.\" Qingwang felt that Luo Shuyu today had changed a lot, he directly asked the old master, became more vigorous, unlike the past, which was like a little fairy, without the slightest smoke.When there was no outsiders, Qingwang talked a lot.\"My son, do you not want to enter the Third Prince's Mansion?\"\"My son, outsiders say that the third prince is cruel and violent. If we go in, don't we have to face him every day? I heard that his whip will eat human blood!\"Luo Shuyu turned over. Open a page on the book table, lightly scolded Qingwang: \"What nonsense, the third prince is not like that, don\u2019t listen to others, many of them are uncountable. In the future, you shouldn\u2019t be partial to the third prince, so as not to cause misfortune to the third prince. If there are too many rumors, everyone will believe it.\"Qingwang was worried, and he stopped talking: \"I see, my son.\" The master doesn't hate the third prince at all, what can he do in the future?Luo Shuyu sent him out: \"Go out first, I'll rest for a while.\"Just after being reborn, he received another imperial edict. Even if Luo Shuyu was reborn once, he needed time to be quiet. He needed to think about everything next. One was Shen Mingyun, and the other is Li Mingjin. Everything was related to Shen Mingyun.How did he come back?He remembered, he hated Shen Mingyun, hated him for ruining their family, he wanted to avenge the dead children, as long as Shen Mingyun was a threat to him and Li Mingjin!He just came back in the afternoon, before he had time to think about whether to live a life again, he received the imperial decree referring to marriage, which was just as his wish. He didn't want to give up Li Mingjin. As for the phrase that stayed far away, don\u2019t think about it. It's impossible in this life.If things went well, he also looked forward to the children's coming to this world again.What he wanted to figure out now was who was pushing their family into the abyss?How many people were involved in this matter?Who is their mastermind?\"After Transmigrating Into a Book, Four Big Brothers Are Fighting to Marry Me \" were mostly the love stories of Shen Mingyun, getting rich and his hooking up with several big brothers. It didn't write about the court affairs. The author didn't understand the court and dinasty matters. Everything was covered in one stroke, and many of the contents were extremely unreasonable. The Shen Mingyun in the book was almost protected and rescued by every man. Everyone thought that he was a dodder flower who needed protection. He was a weak, beautiful, and charming person like a delicate flower, and Shen Mingyun who on the bright side had never been aware of those dark tricks.But, Shen Mingyun really didn't know anything?Luo Shuyu poured himself a cup of cold tea and drank it in one sip. He sat in front of the window with his chin, deep in thought, thinking about it for a long time, until Qingwang reminded him that it was time for dinner.It was quite lively at night. Several aunts brought some homemade food to please Luo Shuyu. He accepted it, but they were all taken down by Qingwang. Luo Shuyu had a poisonous experience when he was a child. Since then, his mother paid special attention to him. After his mother passed away, this habit had been maintained until now.Qingwang came over with a plate of fresh bayberry: \"Master, these are fresh bayberry, I bought it outside today.\"Luo Shuyu nodded, twisted a grain and put it in his mouth: \"Very sweet.\" Looked at Qingwang who stared and drooled over the bayberry, \"You take it to eat, I don't eat much tonight.\"Qingwang happily shared a plate of bayberry with the girls outside.Luo Shuyu remembered that when he was pregnant with his son, he especially liked to eat sour food in the first three months. Li Mingjin sent someone to buy bayberry, and he got a few bayberry trees back and planted the entire yard. He asked why, Li Mingjin sternly gave the words to him: go out to buy, it's expensive.Luo Shuyu said that he had never found someone who dig the tree and still said that buying the bayberry would spend a lot of money.Luo Shuyu thought for a while, smiled, and lay down holding the quilt while remembering those interesting memories in the middle of the night.The princes of the Great Xia Kingdom went out of the palace to build a mansion at the age of sixteen. The third prince was eighteen and had been out of the palace for two years.In the middle of the night, in the high wall courtyard, the study of the Third Prince.After the next person carried away the water for bathing, a dark figure turned over from the window and entered the study room.The black shadow knelt down: \"Master.\"Under the swaying candlelight, Li Mingjin was wiping the whip in his hand, wearing a white robes with dangling wet hair.He stopped the wiping action, gently placed the whip on the book case, raised his light brown eyes with no emotions: \"How?\"The dark guard answered a few words and compared everything he saw in Luofu with Li Mingjin. He raised his eyebrows and said: \"He really said that?\"\"Yes, the subordinates heard it very clearly, and young master Luo said that he is afraid of making trouble for you.\"\"What else did he say?\"\"Nothing else. He went to bed after dinner.\"\"No noise, no scolding, no crying?\"\"Nothing. After the imperial decree came down, he asked Luo Renshou for his mother's dowry.\" he told the things that happened today and the course of the matter.Li Mingjin twisted the lamp needle he was holding, raised his eyes, picked up the wick that was about to burn, and said, \"Go out\"The dark guard quietly glanced at his master and found that his eyes were a little less gloomy.Luo Shuyu was awakened by the whispers of the little maids. He went to bed early last night and slept deeply. Although he didn't get on the pole before the day, he was almost there.The maids noticed that Luo Shuyu was up, and they were busy fetching water to freshen up.After waking up, Luo Shuyu raised the corners of his mouth to face the face in the copper basin. He really lived again, not dreaming.Qingwang brought Luo Shuyu breakfast, some congee, side dishes and meat patties.\"I just went to get breakfast and heard the people from Qingfengyuan say that Master Shen is back in the morning.\"Shen Mingyun is back?\"Oh? What new stuff did he bring back this time?\"He remembered that Shen Mingyun quietly ran into the temple and hid in order to push Luo Shuyu to the third prince Li Mingjin, and now he couldn't wait to come back to verify the results yesterday matter.\"I heard people say that he brought back several carts of fresh melons and fruits. They said that they were planted by the master in the monastery. After eating them, they can prolong their lives. Will you go?\"Luo Shuyu made a plan and said with a sneer: \"Go, why not? Let's taste the sweetness of those melons and fruits.\"He was born again unexpectedly, and all of this thing also because of Shen Mingyun, so he had to give him a portion of small gift.The author has something to say:The third prince: You are not angry?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m The Vicious Cannon Fodder In The BookCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuo Renshou had a good reputation for being a clean and honest official outside. The Luo family was a farming family and relatively economical in the use of money. After Luo Renshou settled in Beijing, the house he lived in was simpler than that of other official.He came from an imperial examination. It took a long time to climb from a sixth-rank official to his current position. His family background was limited, and he was completely incomparable with other wealthy officials. Be cautious, created a good external image, and often warned the family members and subordinates not to be open when acting outside, and the family style was fairly rigorous.But because of Shen Mingyun\u2019s arrival, he inevitably hooked up with various forces. The Luo family\u2019s talents began to be high-profile. Luo Renshou\u2019s status in the court also increased with the tide and also the number of times his name was mentioned. The more you came, the greetings came like snowflakes.This was the first year that Shen Mingyun had entered the book. The original owner, Shen Mingyun, refused to accept his life on the way to Beijing. After that, Shen Mingyun occupied the body of the original owner. He was originally the son of Luo Renshou's relative. A small army officer, the family had been living on the border, because of the invasion of foreign enemies, the city was captured, his father lost his life while resisting foreign enemies, and his family suffered misfortune. Only Shen Mingyun, who was hiding in the cellar could escape. After that, the original Shen Mingyun went to the capital to look for his uncle who was not very close, but he couldn't help it, he was already lost his family.At this time, Luo Shuyu took Qingwang and a maid to Qingquanyun to greet the old lady Luo.(chinese give a name to every yard in their residence)Before people arrived, they heard cheers and laughter from the yard. The old lady laughed the loudest, followed by Liu Shi's. Except for Luo Renshou and the two young masters of the Luo family and two young masters, all of them were here.Although Shen Mingyun\u2019s mother was not born from the old lady, Shen Mingyun\u2019s temperament wass very similar to this old lady from the countryside. The two always talked very happily, and he had a good time chatting with the old lady in Luo\u2019s family. That was Shen Mingyun, if you had not read the book, Luo Shuyu wouldn't know why Shen Mingyun would please the old lady, because they had similar origin, they couldn't integrate into the capital family and rules, and they had a common language. One point, that was, if you also didn\u2019t know the etiquette, you had the same smell.Luo Shuyu thought that it was for this reason that the old lady didn't like him, but he didn't feel it very much, and he didn't have any special expectations. For these so-called relatives, when he died, he had already lost his feelings and even hated them. Everyone was indifference and without selflessness.It was different now, from the moment he entered the old lady's yard, most people's eyes still fell on him.He didn't find a place to sit down and used himself as air like he used to listen to their chats.Liu Shi's style was \"harmony to make money\", with a smile on her face, welcoming people: \"Shu Yu, you came just right. Your cousin just came back from Dajue Temple, and he brought us some interesting melons and fruits. You can try it too.\"Luo Shuyu still wore a blue-colored elegant clothes today, but there was a palm-sized jade pendant around his waist, which was translucent, shiny, and colliding with the jade beads next to it, making a shallow clanking and crisp sound, which was really nice. The charm of a young man was shown to the fullest, looked warm and moist like jade, outstanding and extraordinary.Luo Shuyu looked at the beautiful young man of the same age sitting next to the old lady. That person was the protagonist Shen Mingyun in the book. He and Luo Shuyu had two different looks. Shen Mingyun had a pair of attractive peach eyes. The corners of the eyes are slightly upward, and the nose was slightly straight, somewhat flattering.He remembered in the book that Shen Mingyun commented on his cousin Shen's appearance when he woke up. He was as white as jade, skin was like fat, a beautiful face with melon seed shape, a pair of smart eyes, and his eyes were as silky as silk. A very good look.Why not? Cousin Shen's biological mother came from a brothel. If it was not for a good-looking skin, she would not have been accepted as a concubine by the old man.As a ger, cousin Shen was undoubtedly outstanding in appearance, and Shen Mingyun's own halo conferred by the system, it was not difficult to get the favor of others. Speaking of this favor, Luo Shuyu remembered that there was an item exchange mall in his system. As long as you did the tasks, you could get mall coins. This mall had different items at different prices. These items could be used on Shen Mingyun, or the person he wanted to attack, it could affect the goodwill of others towards him, and could also affect the behavior of others. It was a terrible system prop.For example, Shen Mingyun gave a gift to the old lady on a certain day. As long as he used the props, Shen Mingyun could make a request to the old lady, and the old lady would agree to him and he achieved his goal.Luo Shuyu was drawn to her side by Liu Shi, with a warm attitude as if Luo Shuyu was his biological son.\"Ten I'm gong to have a taste.\" Luo Shuyu ate a fruit delivered by the maids, and peeled it by himself. \"It's very sweet.\"Before Luo Shuyu came, Shen Mingyun had already told everyone the origin of this fruit. Everyone was waiting for Luo Shuyu to ask about this fruit, but when Luo Shuyu ate the third one, he didn't ask about it. Everyone was a little disappointed.Shen Mingyun had already robbed the limelight and felt in his heart that the ancient people didn't have much knowledge. Now he was calm, but the impatient Luo Shuyao jumped out. He was jealous of Shen Mingyun and envied Shen Mingyun. He couldn't beat the opponent. Could only bully Luo Shuyu who was not backed by his mother.Luo Shuyao gloated and asked him: \"Third Brother, do you know how this fruit come from?\"Luo Shuyu casually wiped his fingers with a handkerchief, lighty laughed: \"I guess you know that I don't know\"To Luo Shuyao's understanding of Luo Shuyu who didn't go out of the door and didn't move forward, he smiled and said: \"Knowing is knowing, not knowing is not knowing, why should the third brother play mystery?\"Luo Shuyu smiled back: \"Foreign Objects\" he said : \"Lychee is rare, juicy, sweet and sour, so it has its own flavor. You eat until full, not easy to feel bored. its skin is shiny. It starts to ripen in April. \"Luo Shuyao didn't expect Luo Shuyu to know, his face was a little uncontrollable, and he was furious: \"How did you know?\" He also wanted to humiliate Luo Shuyu.Luo Shuyu said plainly: \"Read more. \"Luo Shuyao's face was scorching, and he was speechless for a while.Shen Mingyun knew that it was because of him that he only wanted to watch the jokes. Just as he was about to say something to ease the atmosphere, he listened to Luo Shuyu's words: \"Compared to this lychee, I once heard that farmers have a trick. They can plant some words. No matter what kind of characters you want, they can plant them.\"Shen Mingyun was surprised by what he said and asked Luo Shuyu the same question. His expression was very straightforward: \"How do you know? \"Luo Shuyu faintly looked at him:\" I know, there is an information about it in the miscellaneous book\"The old lady naturally curious:\" Shuyu, you said that the fruit can grow into a word? Is it magic? \"Luo Shu Yu said. \"It\u2019s not a magical method. This farmer is smart. He wanted to sell his own fruit for more money. He made a special mold to cover the fruit. When the fruit matures, this is what he came up with. The fruit looks exactly like the mold.\u201dAlthough the old lady didn\u2019t like Luo Shuyu very much, there was Luo Renshou, the son who had successfully ascended the position. She also supported the children to learn more knowledge. Luo Shuyu loved to read books. She was still pleased that it was her grandchildren. At this moment, she also increased her awareness of the outside world, and she was happy.As for Shen Mingyun, his face was green and white, and he was slandering what miscellaneous books Luo Shuyu had read, and complaining to the system in his mind.\"System, didn't you say that the things in the mall are unique in this world? What's the matter with Luo Shuyu.\"The system took a long time and answered him: \"Wait for me to check the information, give me five minutes.\"Luo Shuyu drank the tea to clear his throat. In the past, he talked a little, and the other brothers and sisters didn't know what knowledge he had. Now he talked about a few topics so casually, which changed him a little bit.Liu Shi also intervened in a sentence: \"But since this farmer has this method, why have we never seen it at the market?\"Luo Shuyu put down his teacup and said, \"What I read is miscellaneous books. Maybe it's not in our great Xia Country.\" He admired Shen Mingyun's expression from his side of light, which seemed not very good.\"It's not actually produced in our country of Great Xia. It's a pity that I want to see this fruit.\" Liu Shi suddenly asked Shen Mingyun, \"Mingyun, you were close to Liang country before, have you seen this fruit before?\"Shen Mingyun: \"...I haven't seen it before.\" In fact, he was already planting the blessed life fruit, waiting to harvest the fruit, and then sold it.Damn, he thought that no one would know in this world, and now there was no new idea after taking it out, so how could he engage in hunger market?This Luo Shuyu was simply out of luck. Reading a broken book could tell him all his thoughts on growing fruits. What should he do now?Of course Luo Shuyu was deliberate. He knew how much benefit this kind of blessed life fruit brought to Shen Mingyun, and it was also a starting point for him to get closer to the fourth prince. The fourth prince took the fruit as a birthday gift to the queen dowager and won the goodwill of the queen dowager and the emperor also paved the way for him to be called the emperor in the future. It was also an opportunity for Shen Mingyun to appear in front of the royal family.He hoped Shen Mingyun would accept this small gift.After sitting with Mrs. Luo for a while, everyone left, busy with their own affairs.When Luo Shuyu reached his goal, he was about raising his foot to leave, and Shen Mingyun chased him out and stopped him. Just now, the system told him that no one in this world had grown the blessed life fruit, which had big effect on him.\"Hey, wait.\"Luo Shuyu ignored this rude address and pretended not to hear it.Shen Mingyun had to run to him and stopped people: \"Hey, I call you.\"Luo Shuyu glanced at him coldly: \"you don't call my name, who knows who you are calling\"\"I ask you, do you really know about the fruit from miscellaneous books?\" He was wondering if Luo Shuyu had also been traversed.Luo Shuyu was slow and neat, and said in a pun: \"As it seems from the book, reading more books will always be useful.\" Otherwise, like Shen Mingyun, he hated to read the books if not useful.Shen Mingyun: \"...\" He didn't continue chasing Luo Shuyu. He used to be satirical when he saw people, but now he suddenly turned around, a little uncomfortable, what's going on with this fake and noble ancient person.Luo Shuyu took Qingwang back to his yard, and the corners of his mouth were slightly raised. It was also interesting to describe him in a sentence that Shen Mingyun often said to despise ordinary people: uncultured and terrible.If Shen Mingyun was illiterate, he would have been exposed by now.Three days later, Qin Tianjian calculated the date of the marriage between the third prince Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu.(qin tianjian = an official name in ancient china. In charge of observing astronomy, calculating calender, and time service)The next day, the third prince appeared at Luo's house with a gloomy face like a Raksha and his black long whip that could suck human blood.The Luo family was in a panic.God!According to the legend, the third prince who could stop children from crying at night, he was here!The author has something to say:Third Prince: I'm going to see my wife~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He sent two good days to Emperor Tiansheng, one before the Mid-Autumn Festival more than a month later, and the other on the eighteenth of the twelfth lunar month.After the court, Emperor Tiansheng called the third prince, he and the queen chose August 10.\"The Queen and I are even more interested in letting you two get married before the Mid-Autumn Festival on August 10th.\"The third prince still had that unpleasant face, and said flatly: \"Okay.\"Emperor Tiansheng asked Li Mingjin calmly: \"In the future, he will be a family member.\"The third prince: \"Yeah.\"Emperor Tiansheng was accustomed from his indifferent appearance. He was \u00a0sure to tell him a string of moving words later.The Emperor Tiansheng looked at him and was disturbed: \"Okay, go back and be prepared.\"The third prince: \"Thank you, father.\"Luo Shumo, the young master of the Luo family, opened a poem meeting in the yard today and invited many friends and classmates. Among them, there was Liu Zhufeng, the second young master of Xiangfu, but no one knew that he not only came, but also brought third prince. The lineup was quite strong, which scared everyone present, even the people of Luofu who heard about it. The reputation of the third prince frightened them, for fear that one of them couldn't take good care of his legs and be whipped by the whip!The people at the poem meeting couldn't help looking at each other. The third prince didn't like gathering with them, literate and ink scholars. What did he mean by coming here?Three days ago, the Luo family accepted the imperial decree. For the time being, there was no intuitive feeling of being relatives with the royal family. Now the whole family knew the arrival of the third prince, everyone was panicked, and the one who most worrying in his heart was the one who was holding this poem meeting, Luo Shumo.Li Mingjin had an official position when he was an adult, and Luo Renshou often saw him, which was okay, but he (LRS) didn't attend the gathering of young people, and he was still working in the central government office without knowing that the third prince swaggered to the door.Luo Shumo had his own circle. He listened to his father\u2019s words and was not in a hurry to stand in line, but he was the companion of the eldest prince, so he had a relatively close relationship with him. He didn't have any intersection with the third prince, and the third prince had always been perverse, couldn\u2019t play with them, because each of them held positions in different ministries.The first prince went to the Ministry of Industry, the crown prince went to the Ministry of Husbandry, the third prince went to the Ministry of Punishment, and the fourth prince went to the Ministry of Rites.Now, no one didn't know that the third son of the Luo family was about to enter the third prince\u2019s mansion. Even if Luo Shumo didn't have much contact with the third prince, although he had a marriage contract with his brother, he couldn't regard him as his brother-in-law. After all, he was a noble prince.Luo Shumo often studied with Luo Renshou, still secretly trying to figure out why the third prince suddenly ran to his house.Was it because of his third brother?But his third brother rarely left the house. Even if they had a marriage contract, it was impossible to have contact with the third prince. On the contrary, he knew how cousin Shen and the third prince had a relationship.The literate at the poem meeting trembled at first because of the arrival of the third prince. Later, because of the idea proposed by the crown prince, they competed with each other, and frequently produced good poems and sentences, and they could play well. With joy, they gradually began to ignore the gloomy third prince who was sitting aside drinking.After noon, Luo Shuyu ate and fell sleepy, so he took a nap, and he had a dream of the last life.He dreamed that he was holding the child\u2019s cold body and looking at his little face that was so cold but he could do nothing. He cried and screamed like a crazy. No one paid any attention. He went from house to house looking for help, but every house closed the door tightly, rejecting his request to treat the child, and couldn't even ask for hot soup. In the end, the family of three died under the chaos of arrows, and the snow covered their bodies, how sad.He was awakened by the tragic death of the three people in his dream, touched the corner of his wet eyes, and he cried in his dream again.After waking up, he didn't feel sleepy anymore, Qingquan gave him mouthwash, washed his face, and became a lot more sober.Looking at the time, it was not three quarters, the afternoon sun was hot, and it was easy to get dazzled when walking outside.Luo Shuyu asked Qingquan: \" where is Qingwang ?\"Qingquan said: \"He was here just now, I guess he went to chat with others, and I will definitely talk to him when he come back.\"Qingquan is older than Qingwang and the first-class maid of Luo Shuyu, she is in charge of Luo Shuyu\u2019s yard. She was assigned by the Liu family a few years ago. Luo Shuyu always had no secrets to hide, she couldn't say anything to the Liu Shi, and Qingquan had been maintaining everything like before.Luo Shuyu never repay virtue with grievances. It was a pity that if he didn't do it, it didn't mean that Qingquan couldn't do it.But after Luo Shuyu returned from rebirth, his trust in Qingquan changed, and Qingwang was the only one who allowed to do important things.Recently, she felt a little powerless and felt that the third son was not so easy to understand, and she was a little impatient.In recent days, several servants who served Luo Shuyu were trying to find their way. They didn't want to enter the Third Prince's Mansion. Luo Shuyu looked at them and respected their decision. In his previous life, he didn't bring anyone except Qingwang. After the imperial decree came down, the fastest runner was Qingquan in his yard. In the past few days, he quietly observed that she would almost ask him to leave Ruyiyuan.(Ruyiyuan = LSY's yard name)After he ate a bowl of jelly, the whole body felt comfortable, and the sultry in his heart had gone a bit, Luo Shuyu asked people to move the desk under the flower stand, he wanted to write a few words for meditation.Before holding the brush, Qingquan was like in his previous life. She wanted to say something to Luo Shuyu and stopped. He didn't have the mood to see. Qingquan said in a hurry, \" My son, Qingquan has something to ask for.\"Luo Shuyu bowed his head, his fingertips lightly stroked the tip of the brush, didn't look at Qingquan, and said lightly, \"You have followed me for four years.\"Qingquan was shocked: \" My son, it's been four years.\"Luo Shuyu's eyes didn't make any waves: \"For so many years, I think I have never owed you.\"Qingquan knelt down quickly, she knew that Luo Shuyu had an exquisite heart, he never beat and scolded them wanton and harshly like other people. He had a very good heart, but she cared her pwn life more.\"Sorry, son, I, my mother wrote the day before yesterday, saying that she had booked a marriage for me.\"Luo Shuyu didn't mean to hold her at all, and said extremely refreshingly : \"Okay, since you don't want to follow me to the Third Prince's Mansion, I'm not reluctant. You will pack up your baggage later and walk cleanly.\"He raised his head and asked the other people on the side with a slightly cold voice, \"Who else is going to leave, I will agree.\"The maids who were familiar with Qingquan knelt down and asked to leave. They were not the children of this family, they belonged to the Liu family and transferred them here.The third son looked deserted and difficult to approach, but those who knew him knew he was good at talking. To put it bluntly, he had no position in the Luo family, and even his servants were harder than him. Now he wanted to enter the Third Prince's Mansion. The other party was more terrible than Raksha, just hearing the name made people scared, who knew if they could live through next year after entering.For Luo Shuyu, the previous life was simply a great irony, but people tended to avoid the disadvantages, so if they wanted to leave, just let them go.When Qingquan was still in a daze about Luo Shuyu's quick release of people, Qingwang ran into the yard hurriedly: \"My son, my son!\"Luo Shuyu looked at his lively appearance and said, \"Qingwang, go get the contract of Qingquan and others.\"Qingwang who just ran in: \"Huh? Son...\"At this time, a quiet wind was slowly blowing in, blowing away a little heat.Qingquan and the others didn't expect Luo Shuyu to come so fast, it caught them off guard!Qingwang didn't enter the house to get the contract. He ran out of breath, leaned into his ear, he said: \"I just heard that the third prince are coming, and he is now at the young master's poem meeting! \"The writing brush in Luo Shuyu's hand fell to the ground, and without seeing the people kneeling on the ground, he instead asked Qingwang to follow him into the house.Qingwang followed into the house and asked Luo Shuyu: \" My son, what do they do?\"Luo Shuyu said without emotion: \"Tell Fubao to stare at them. I haven't come back, no one can get up.\"\"Big Brother's Poetry Club, when does it start?\"\"It started at a moment's notice, I just found out that the third prince seems to be here too.\"\"Is there any other princes?\"\"Yes, the prince is like a god. The crown prince came with the eldest prince and the fourth prince. I don't know why the third prince also followed.\"\"Where is Shen Mingyun? Is he in the mansion?\"\"I didn't hear that he went out, he should be in the mansion, son, what's the matter?\"\"It's okay, go, let's go to the poem meeting to see.\"When he came out again, he put on a new set of cyan long shirt with narrow sleeves, a crescent belt with a white auspicious cloud pattern on the waist, and a white jade hollow carved waistband.Qingwang thought to himself, the son who changed into a new suit was so different, he was so handsome that he couldn't help but opened his eyes, and his temperament was definitely better than the No. 1 beauty in capital!Luo Shuyu knew that he was no worse in dressing than others, so he took out a written letter from the box and took Qingwang out.As for Qingquan and others, who were kneeling on the ground, looked at each other, they could only kneel on the cobblestone ground against the blazing sun.For a while, they didn't know whether the current decision was right or wrong.Qingquan was even more embarrassed. She bit her lip. This third son usually didn't fight or grab. She thought that going to the Third Prince's Mansion wouldn't be treated preferentially. It was better to stay in Luofu and continued to serve the eldest lady.Now the third son gave up on her directly, with no intention of keeping her, and his attitude was resolute.The more Qingquan thought about it, the more panicked she became, and she sat down on the ground, her heart was cold. Did the son know what she did?No, he didn't even get out of the door very often on weekdays, no.Luo Shuyu was walking on the way to the yard where Luo Shumo's poem meeting. At this time, the lotus plants in the lotus pond were blooming with fresh and tender pink and white lotus, which looked very comfortable.If he remembered correctly, today's Shen Mingyun would shine in the eldest brother's poem meeting, attracting the attention of several princes with a poem.The poem was not written by him, but provided by the so-called system. It was said that it was written by a poet of a dynasty he didn't know.Luo Shuyu stood by the lotus pond and thought for a while, the title of the poem described in the book-\"Jiang Jinjiu\" emerged in his mind. At that time, this poem had been popular in capital for a long time, and many scholars often took this poem to encourage students.To change the fate of their family, you must first destroyed all the adventures of Shen Mingyun, and you must never let him appeared at the poem meeting.Just as he was about to continue to the direction of the poem meeting, he saw a person standing in the pavilion, his back was very familiar, and then the other person looked towards him.The two looked at each other across the lotus pond. Luo Shuyu walked quickly to the pavilion. When he was five meters away from the other side, he stood still, staring at the person blankly, his breath became unstable and he hurried up.He thought that they might not meet again until the day they got married, but he didn't expect to be so caught off guard.he never thought that he would see him here, it was Li Mingjin who was alive, his light brown eyes were staring at him.At this time Luo Shuyu faced people who should make him scared \u00a0in his previous life, but he was not afraid of this person at this moment, didn't resent their marriage, didn't want to escape, only the joy of recovering from the loss.Li Mingjin used to block arrows for himself, lived and died with himself, and they had a child.He was still alive, he was still young and handsome.Facing this jade-like young face, Luo Shuyu remembered him covered in blood, with arrows stuck in his back, and gritted his teeth to endure the repeated injuries. He shed tears unconsciously. It was about pain, tears of joy, and also catharsis of grievances and sadness after being reborn.Li Mingjin, who had just come out of the poem meeting, frowned slightly, and walked forward a few steps with the shock in his heart.He knew inexplicably that this person must be Luo Shuyu, his future imperial concubine.But, what is he crying for?Li Mingjin was at a loss for a while, standing in front of Luo Shuyu with a sullen face, he glanced at the other party, not a single heavy word uttered.\"I didn't bully you.\"When he opened his mouth, Luo Shuyu's tears fell even more fiercely. He stared at the person in front of him, his eyes didn't dare to blink, for fear that it would become a bubble in the next moment. Although the familiar face was slightly looked younger, but his voice was nostalgic and very familiar.With Li Mingjin's stern face, he thought about coming to Shangshu Mansion to take a sneak peek at Luo Shuyu. He never thought of scaring people to cry, he couldn't do anything to coax people, but he couldn't let him cry like that. He said: \"Don't cry.\"His heart felt terribly painful without knowing it. Li Mingjin raised his sleeves and gently wiped Luo Shuyu's tears. The expression on his face was a bit fierce but his movements were extremely gentle, as if he wanted to wipe his tears before, but had not been completed, he had an urge to complete this move.He looked at Luo Shuyu's red eyes, and said solemnly: \"Don't cry anymore.\"The author has something to say:The third prince: The wife doesn't cry, come to lure.Luo Shuyu: ...Go away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He just remembered some scenes and gave birth to love. Thinking back to his last life and seeing Li Mingjin today, he couldn't help crying.In the end, he cried until he hiccupped, his face was hot as if he had been roasted by the August sun. He had never cried in front of Li Mingjin before, and the last parting in his previous life was no longer counted.After crying, he felt a little embarrassed. Now Li Mingjin was not married to him. He cried like a fool and he didn\u2019t know if it would scare people away. He couldn't help but feel a little sad. He finally wanted to be nice to him. He might have done something he didn't like.But Li Mingjin was more at a loss than he was. The two faced each other. Luo Shuyu raised his blurred eyes to look at him, seeing that there was no disgust in his eyes, and his heart was let go.Li Mingjin stared at him: \"You, don't cry.\"\"I just got sand in my eyes.\" Luo Shuyu forced a sophistry, \"I didn't want to cry.\"\"Yeah.\" Li Mingjin only started to look at his future imperial concubine now, good at telling nonsense with opened eyes.In addition to the crying red eyes, Luo Shuyu looks was the most outstanding of the young men he had ever seen. The simple hairstyle was very simple but elegant, without the fragrance of powder, only a plain hosta was inserted on his head, his face was like peach, plums and apricot eyes, there seemed to be starlight in the middle, his chin lifted slightly, and he was looking at Li Mingjin seriously and intently.No one had ever dared to look at him directly like this, Li Mingjin's heart was throbbing again, his heart beating too fast today.He just didn't know how he cried like this when he saw him. Was he really so terrible?Luo Shuyu, who was reborn, knew that Li Mingjin had never hated himself in his previous life. At that time, perhaps because of preconceived thoughts in the evaluation of the outside world, he had never been in touch with him. After the two had children, they gradually realized that he was not the same character like others said, but unfortunately, he didn't give him more time to dig, and the family was destroyed.Fortunately, he was born again, and he wanted to get to know Li Mingjin, his husband again.It was hard to live a life again, and you must live well. Blocked and killed the gods and buddha, no one could stop him from living.He raised his head and looked directly at Li Mingjin seriously. He wanted to engrave Li Mingjin at this moment in his heart so that he would not forget it in the future. God gave him one more opportunity, and he must not waste it.There were still many differences between Li Mingjin now and a few years later. His face was gloomy, looked like lacking of sleep, his facial contours were deeper than others, the eye sockets were more obvious, and his light brown eyes. When looking at people, it would become a little deep without knowing it. It looked like he had followed the Western Regions mother. In fact, his sword eyebrows and star eyes were extraordinary handsome and very attractive. Today, he wore a jade belt on his waist and a pair of white boots under his feet.In Luo Shuyu's eyes, Li Mingjin now was excellent everywhere.After Luo Shuyu calmed down his emotions, he took out an envelope he brought when he went out. He sniffed and handed the letter to Li Mingjin: \"Here you are.\"Li Mingjin didn't know what he meant, thinking that his future imperial concubine would pass the love letter to him. The heart was jumping around, and his face became tighter. Luo Shuyu was afraid of his misunderstanding, and explained: \"This is a poem.\"The love poem for him, Li Mingjin stared at him while thinking, and asked in a deep voice. \"You are going to the poem meeting?\"Luo Shuyu shook his head: \"No, I heard someone wanted to plagiarize this poem at the poem meeting to get the attention of others. I like this poem and the late poet very much. I don't want this poem was plagiarized by others, so I wanted to expose the matter, so that everyone wouldn't be deceived.\"Li Mingjin opened the letter, glanced at the poem, and nodded after reading it. The poem was good, and the imperial concubine's words were good, so he asked him again. \"Who is the poet ?\"Luo Shuyu remembered that Shen Mingyun called the poet Li Bai, the fairy of poetry.\"His name is Li Bai. I found it when I was collecting books from other places. I don't know which country he is from. His poems made me think of ambitions. I liked it. Later I learned that there are people like me. He gets this poet's collection of poems and wants to release it at the poem meeting. I want to stop it.\"\"I see.\" Li Mingjin regretted that it was not a love poem written for him. \"I will go back to the poem meeting first.\"Luo Shuyu moved his lips to remind him: \"Don't mention it yourself.\"\"Yeah.\" Li Mingjin had a little time to come out. Ready to leave with the guards, walked two steps and returned, unfastened the dagger around his waist and handed it to Luo Shuyu, \"Take it\"Luo Shuyu was surprised when he took the dagger. This dagger had followed Li Mingjin for along time. In years, he rarely saw him take it off and kept it on his body. Why was it suddenly given to him?At the end, Li Mingjin left him a sentence: \"Our wedding date is August 10th.\"Luo Shuyu held the dagger, before he had time to ask about the wedding date, Li Mingjin had already left with the letter. He had a lot of thoughts to say, however, it didn't matter, they still had a lot of time to get along in the future.The wedding date was 10 August, four months earlier than in his previous life. He remembered that when he got married in his previous life, it was in the twelfth lunar month, and that winter was particularly cold.On the wedding night, Li Mingjin returned to the room, but the two didn't share the same bed, one on the bed and the other on the couch. Luo Shuyu at that time was a bit grateful. Now thinking about it, his performance at that time should be terrible, and it didn\u2019t show anyone a little bit good face.Holding the dagger in his hand, Luo Shuyu's mouth raised slightly. Was this trust in exchange for trust?Li Mingjin believed him, why? So easy?From the initial sentimental to the present joyfulness, Luo Shuyu didn't take back his thoughts until Qingwang, who was frightened for a while before returning to his soul, called him back.\"Gongzi, are we still going to the poem meeting?\"(gongzi, title for the son of official)Luo Shuyu held the dagger in front of his chest and said, \"No, go back, yes, find someone trustworthy to stare at Shen Mingyun.\"\"Yes.\" After that Qingwang couldn't help but gossip. \"Gongzi, the third, the third prince...\" He actually gave gongzi a dagger, what did he want to do? But it was still scary to look at him, especially when his eyes looked at people, they were full of darkness, like the enchanting Lord Yama.Luo Shuyu smiled, and he also instructed Qingwang to explore the news at the poem meeting. He didn't know what Li Mingjin would do after he got the poem.The two returned to Ruyiyuan. Luo Shuyu now had no one in his hands. In his previous life, he always disdained to play conspiracies with people. He felt that being like that was not open and upright, but now he found that he talked about being open and upright, didn't do conspiracy and his life was gone. It was comfortable to live for yourself.He died not only because other princes targeted Li Mingjin, but also Shen Mingyun's attitude towards him.To say that they had a deep hatred was not enough, but Shen Mingyun was a small-minded person, loved to bear grudges, and must give retribution to other, he cared about everything, and liked to exaggerated something. It was said that he came from a peaceful, open and high degree of freedom place. In the world of advanced science and technology, he looked down people in this world, he always hated trivial things, not magnanimous people.Luo Shuyu carefully recalled the content of the book, and the biggest conflict between him and Shen Mingyun should be that matter.In the last life, after he became the concubine of the third prince, he inevitably had to participate in various banquets. Today was a Hundred Flower Banquet held by a certain imperial concubine, tomorrow was a garden party held by the Queen, and the day after tomorrow may be a full moon banquet for the newborn of a certain important minister. He had to attend all the unavoidable banquets.He and Shen Mingyun met at a certain banquet. At that time, the people around him were very reckless and damaged a valuable painting he was holding. It was a painting that Luo Shuyu finally got after asking people for a year. He was very angry, so Qingwang taught the ignorant servant a meal, hit the board a few times, and was able to move freely after lying down for two days. But Shen Mingyun didn't think so. He felt that Luo Shuyu was very vicious and privately charged him with using his power to slash his life. He remembered that in the book, Shen Mingyun later used four words (characters in chinese) to evaluate the deaths of him and Li Mingjin\u2014the deaths were caused by guilt.Luo Shuyu not only thought, what did he do wrong? What did his innocent child do wrong?Shen Mingyun had done a lot to keep the glory and wealth in his hands. The people who were indirectly got hurt didn't know who he was, why didn't he realize that he was at fault?After returning to the yard, Qingquan and others still knelt and waited for Luo Shuyu, everyone was dizzy from the sun.Luo Shuyu ordered them to pack up and got out of his yard.He was able to happily let Qingquan and the others left today. He also knew that this kind of betrayal maid no one would want to take them in except Liu Shi, and they didn't need him to take revenge, their future would not be any better.The Liu family originally had more trusted maids, it was impossible to arrange for them to stay in their yard, they would only be sent elsewhere, only worse than they were now, and it would be difficult to have a chance to go up.What was a pity for him? No, it was a pity that he was willing to do for them.Qingwang spurned a few words after they left and embarrassed from the bottom of his heart because being seen by gongzi.Luo Shuyu also comforted him: \"Let's look at the future.\"Qingwang thought for a while and knew what his gongzi meant.The departure of Qingquan and other maids had little effect on their life. There were five servants left, all young and could do some rough work on weekdays. In the past, they belonged to Qingquan, but now Qingquan left. After that, they were under Qingwang's control.In this life, first he must cultivate talents who were loyal to himself.Compared to other yards, Luo Shuyu didn't have many people here, but it was still enough for now.As soon as Qingquan left, Liu Shi immediately brought a group of people over.Today's Luo Shuyu was not the same, and he would soon be the third prince's concubine. How could there be any trouble at home? Qingquan, who was not sensible, she would make her look good after the matter was over!He didn't know about others, but he still knew a lot about Liu Shi from the book. She held the key of his mother's dowry storeroom in her hand.It could be seen how much Luo Renshou trusted Liu Shi.She knew how to behave pitifully, knew how to keep money and other principles, but the sons and daughter she taught didn't learn half of her. After he entered the prince\u2019s mansion, she clearly told Luo Shuyao and Luo Shuyue to keep a low profile, but it was often backfired.Luo Shuyue, Luo Shuyao and Shen Mingyun didn\u2019t really deal with each other very much, mainly in terms of the beauty. They used the jewelry and fabrics in the dowry of Luo Shuyu\u2019s mother that was sent by Liu Shi to compete with Shen Mingyun, but they were beaten in the face by Shen Mingyun, because Shen Mingyun could always let the system gave him a new style pattern.\"Shu Yu...\"Luo Shuyu had already sat down and waited for her arrival before anyone arrived.Liu Shi came in with a smile, and was about to mention Qingquan and other maids, but Luo Shuyu smiled and said: \"Aunt Liu, are you here to give me my mother's dowry list and warehouse key?\"Liu Shi's smile froze on her face. \u00a0Called her aunt, what did it mean?While dissatisfied, she was panicked.The author has something to say:The Third Prince: Where is my love poem?Luo Shuyu: ...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 Write to MeBefore Liu Shi became the mistress of the Luo family, Luo Shuyu called her Aunt Liu, and didn't disrespect her. In his previous life, he had expectations of the so-called father, so he called her liu yi niang. Now he was reborn and knew something about her mother. After all it was human life, in terms of the cause of her death, the possibility Liu was suspected was not small, there were too many private affairs in the back house.(yi niang = father's concubine)Right now, he was still wondering whether his mother really died of illness or was murdered. If it was the latter, he must seek justice for his mother.When he was young, his mother was healthy, talked and laughed, and rarely got sick. Suddenly one day, his mother began to cough suddenly, her face became bloodless and pale, and occasionally coughed up bleeding. He heard that his mother had tuberculosis and had no cure, so they separated the mother and child. Before long, she was taken away by God, very suddenly.Looking back carefully, his mother's illness came too suddenly, without warning.Once he was born again, he did not believe what he had heard in his previous life. Sometimes what you saw and heard may be what other people let you hear and see. From the day he entered the Third Prince's Mansion, he was calculated by Luo Renshou. Perhaps Luo Renshou had never expected his birth. Even marrying his mother he had to do it for promotion.Calculating the time, there was still more than a month before his marriage contract with Li Mingjin, and he still had time to investigate some things.Liu Shi stood in front of him, with a bunch of young faces, handsome gers and beautiful maids behind her, all exquisite. This was not sent to him as present, but to the third prince to warm the bed.It was the title aunt that made Liu Shi so angry that she was about to vomit blood, but she still had a smiling face with her now, and she chose not to hear it for the time being.\"Shu Yu, the girls with Qingquan are not sensible. I will punish them severely. Now I have re-selected some people for you. I will keep whichever you like.\"Luo Shuyu glanced at random and showed a warm smile: \"I don't need to give someone away, Aunt Liu, if I take these people into the Third Prince's Mansion, what will others think of me? I'm afraid they will say that we Luo family can only serve people. In the future, your daughter and ger will still marry. Although I'm not your own, don\u2019t write everything on your face. Anyway I didn\u2019t care about you before, it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have any ideas. \"He was really a bully before, and gave such people a chance.He took this group of people into the Third Princes' Mansion back then, and all of them wanted to climb on the bed of the Third Prince. In the end, they made a fire in the third prince and he beat these people because of annoyance. And Luo Shuyu would actually become angry because he hit someone, thinking that Li Mingjin didn't take him seriously, now thinking about it, Liu Shi had planted evil for him early, who could be blamed, blamed himself for being stupid.Such a non-euphemistic response made Liu Shi even more angry, and Luo Shuyu was also very good at pinching her weakness, the childs was her lifeblood.He was now barefoot and not afraid of wearing shoes. He wanted to do what he didn't do in his previous life, and he could even do it in front of Liu Shi's face.Liu Shi was not a good thing either.\"Okay, if you don't want it, you don't know what is good or bad.\" Liu Shi also began to reveal her other side, lowering her voice: \"Don't think you are really a great person if you enter the Third Prince's Mansion, let's go! \"Before turning around, she added, \"Who doesn't know that you married because of Shen Mingyun.\"As soon as Liu Shi changed her respectful appearance, the gentle face showed a bit of malice, and she gave Luo Shuyu eye drops provocatively. The ability to divorce people was first-rate, and perhaps he would believe to the words \"marrying someone for Shen Mingyun\", when he changed to someone else or in his previous life.Luo Shuyu was not angry at all, and then smiled: \"Really?\" He was more willing to learn the truth from Li Mingjin's mouth.Liu Shi didn\u2019t understand how Luo Shuyu\u2019s temperament changed overnight. She didn\u2019t think he was hard-spirited, she just thought he was like a fool, thinking that he could do whatever he wanted in the Third Princes's Mansion. Look at the day when he was disgusted by the third prince.Liu Shi hummed and left Ruyiyuan, not knowing what idea in Luo Shuyu's mind who put away his smile.The two tore off the thin layer of on the surface and it was no longer possible to maintain the past and peaceful appearance.On weekdays, Luo Shuyu's behavior wasn't taken seriously by the Luo family and he didn't seem to care much about other people's actions in recent days.It wasn't convenient for him to go out, so he handed over the matter to Qingwang.Qingwang had no father and no mother. Since he was a child, he was sold to Luo family. Luo Shuyu's mother chose him to take care of him. He and Qingquan used to take care of the Ruyiyuan. Now Qingquan left early, and now everything in the courtyard was left to him (QW), he (LSY) would have to do some other things.In the evening, Luo Shuyu ate alone in the yard. He didn't feel lonely because he had a good meal tonight.Qingwang poured Luo Shuyu a glass of peach blossom wine made in spring: \"Young master, do you know what happened at the afternoon poem meeting?\"Luo Shuyu squeezed the white porcelain small wine glass in his hand: \" What happened?\"Qingwang mysteriously said: \" You don\u2019t know, our young master Shen directly broke into the poem meeting organized by the young master. He said that he passed by and heard them writing poems and felt interesting. Several princes were also there and young master Shen was able to show off, he made a poem to compare with everyone else!\"\"Oh? Then?\"\"At first, the young master's friends were praising him and the crown prince said that he would give the poem to the emperor to see, but who knows, while Shen young master was triumphant, the second young master of Zhou University\u2019s scholar\u2019s family said that the poem was not made by young master Shen all! young master Shen confronted him and asked him who wrote it. The second young master Zhou said that he had read this poem in an ancient poetry collection. He also copied it down. The poet's name is Li Bai !\"\"Oh? How did cousin Shen answer?\"\"Young master Shen squeaked, he seemed wanted to say something, but he didn't squeeze a rebuttal for a long time. His face was pale and he was fainted on the spot and was carried by everyone. I heard from the people present that the faces of the eldest young master and the second young master were all lost by him.\"\"In the beginning the two elder brothers should have enjoyed it very much.\"\"Yes, the eldest and the second young master saw that young master Shen had some talents and were proud of him, so they praised him.\"\"There was no prince who helped him speak?\"\"It is said that the fourth prince said something for him and the eldest prince said something good. The third prince kicked the table over on the spot. Many students felt that they were humiliated and followed the princes to leave our Luo Mansion.\"\"Interesting, What about now?\" Luo Shuyu liked the peach blossom in the wine. He squinted his eyes, a little smokey, and the corners of his eyes were stained with peach.Li Mingjin's kicking over the table, it really seemed like he would do it. He had always been called \"unlearned and unskilled.\"\"After the master came back, he heard about it and called them all to the study room to scold them. Master also arrested young master Shen and told him not to run around. He also ordered the elder young masters to apologize to others in private and pushed all the fault to young master Shen. The several shops owned by young master Shen have a good reputation in our capital and they will surely be affected after this story goes out.\"\"Um, probably not.\" This fake cousin had a lot of ideas and he had a lot of money. There was a system that could help him became famous. However, regardless of his vigor, Shen Mingyun in the book had never suffered setbacks, and even if something happened, he had some noble people to help. But what if there were no more noble people?Luo Shuyu walked in the yard for a while, and then let Qingwang got ink and notebook.His memory had always been good, and he copied all the poems about Li Bai that appeared in the book in his notebook.He said: \" You will find an opportunity to send this collection of poem to the Third Prince's Mansion tomorrow, and it will be handled by him.\"Qingwang: \"Young master, will it be okay if I go like this?\"Luo Shuyu: \"It's okay, you can take another jar of peach blossom wine in the yard and deliver it together tomorrow.\"\"Oh, I understand!\" Qingwang suddenly joked, \"Young master, do you want to write letter to the third prince?\"Luo Shuyu thought for a moment: \"No need to write.\"Qingwang also saw the third prince in the afternoon, and found that the third prince was not scary at all, and the third prince didn't use a whip to whip people, which seemed to be different from the rumors outside.Third Prince's Mansion.Li Mingjin, who had just finished practicing a set of swordsmanship, was dripping with sweat, and the sweat got into his thin practice clothes from between his neck.He asked the third dark guard: \"Why he doesn't write to me?\"The third dark guard: \"I don't know.\"Li Mingjin threw the towel on the shelf:. \"Useless\"The third dark guard grievanced, \u00a0Why didn't the future imperial concubine write to him?Li Mingjin wasn't entangled in Luo Shuyu's refusal to write to him, but faintly looked forward to the Peach Blossom Wine.Li Mingjin: \"Is the peach blossom wine made by himself?\"The third dark guard wanted to shrink: \"Subordinates guess it.\"After talking about the things that made Li Mingjin happy, the dark guard brought up the matter about Liu Shi, Li Mingjin's eyes sank: \"Send him a few useful people tomorrow.\"Those scumbags also dared to bully him.The third dark guard: \"Yes.\"Li Mingjin: \"Also, go and get the wine back by yourself.\"The next day, Luo Shuyu got up early, the flowers and plants in the yard were bathed in the morning light, looking energetic.He stretched.Qingwang personally went to the small kitchen to serve breakfast.Just after breakfast, there was a sound from outside.At the beginning was the housekeeper who always had eyes higher than the top, followed by an old maid, a young imperial guard, and six sturdy maids, each with good manners and no mistakes at all. The housekeeper had not yet spoken, and the grandmother with a serious face beside him said: \"Meet Lord Luo, I got the order from the third prince to come and serve the young master, young master can order me to do for anything he wants.\"Luo Shuyu was caught up in the battle, a little confused: \"The third prince?\"The grandmother said: \"Yes.\"The guard on the side stepped forward and handed out a letter: \"Master Luo, this is a letter from the master. Please be sure to reply after you read it.\"Luo Shuyu took the letter: \"... \"These people were a little bit sudden, Li Mingjin from the previous life didn't interact with him before marriage.Was it because he cried so badly yesterday that he was worried about him?Luo Shuyu accepted several maids, and then said to the guards: \"Wait for a while.\"He opened the letter Li Mingjin had written to him. There were only seven short words in it, three of which were his name.\u3010write me a letter. Li Mingjin]Luo Shuyu wrote back to Li Mingjin without thinking about it.After a while, the guard got Luo Shuyu's blow-dried letter, brought a jar of peach blossom wine and a thin collection of poems and left Luo Mansion.At noon, Li Mingjin rarely didn't go to drink and listen to music, waiting for Luo Shuyu's reply early in the house.When he saw the letter, the corner of his mouth was slightly curved, but after reading the letter, the corner of his mouth was closed again and his face became gloomy.\u3010All right. Luo Shuyu. ]What about the letter?The author has something to say:Li Mingjin: The imperial concubine is really too much.Luo Shuyu: How are you doing?Li Mingjin: \u2026\u2026[\u70ba\u70ba\u7d93\u6a02.jpg]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 EvidenceAlthough the third prince sent people to Luo's house were not in compliance with the rules, Luo Renshou couldn't say anything.Li Mingjin was the prince of the Great Xia Kingdom. He only sent people to help to deal with the matter of getting married. It could also be said that he was looking for a momo to guide Luo Shuyu's royal etiquette. He wouldn't be criticized, and he had included Luo Shuyu in Li Mingjin's protection in advance. It made him, the future \"father-in-law\" a little bit uncomfortable, but he just made it up to himself. He would be better with Luo Shuyu earlier and wouldn't have a problem with him. After the maids sent by Li Mingjin moved into Ruyiyuan, the little maids in the yard were trained by the maids to stand and sit, and changed from the old lazy posture. Luo Shuyu had to thank Li Mingjin for gave him the charcoal in the snow.(\u5b37\u5b37, momo = elderly lady, wet nurse)The third prince also reminded Luo Renshou, he couldn't underestimate Luo Shuyu, the third prince attached great importance to him.Luo Shuyu had a good time in the past two days. Naturally, he didn't need to learn the royal etiquette anymore. He had already imprinted these rules in his mind in his previous life.Speaking of rules, he couldn\u2019t help but think of Shen Mingyun. His behavior was different from ordinary people. The rule was also one of them. He always put the seven words \"the man has gold under his knees\" on his lips. He knelt very perfunctorily, always despising those who abide the etiquette and laws. In Luo's family, he was particularly uncomfortable with the well-behaved Luo Shuyu.Shen Mingyun had been confined at home for the past two days and was not allowed to go out of the gate of Luo Mansion to avoid being ridiculed, but he still heard about him playing around in the yard, almost burnt his small kitchen, destroying a lot of valuables furnitures. According to the news brought back by Qingwang, who was recently entrusted with an important task, many people would regard it as a joke when mentioning the poet meeting of the Luo family. They never thought that it was actually plagiarism, it was the shame of scholars. No one wanted to associate with such people. The heat was getting hotter and hotter, and even the income of several shops selling rouge opened by Shen Mingyun began to decline. But in the end he was a ger, and the influence was not as great as expected. Luo Shuyu didn't run to Shen Mingyun's yard while the iron was hot, but investigated the death of his mother. After seeing through Luo Renshou's true face, Luo Shuyu no longer believed in all the things he had seen before. Those were just superficial, and the truth might be more awkward, lower and less influential than he knew.Even Qingwang, who used to be always bluffing, had changed his behavior now. He had a much calmer temper. Not only did he learn from the momo, but Luo Shuyu gave him a heavier task, which made him even more serious and responsible.Luo Shuyu let the others back and asked Qingwang, \"What happened to what I asked you to investigate?\"Qingwang lowered his voice, for fear that others would listen. The recent spy life he did well: \"Young master, I followed your instructions. Dressed as a countryman, I went to Zhongdetang to ask people and learned that Dr. Liang, who treated madam at the time, left Beijing ten years ago, saying that something happened at home and went back to his hometown. Later, I spent some money. Asked the old doctor of Zhongdetang, they said that at that time, someone saw Doctor Liang laughing strangely in the middle of the night, as if he had picked up a cart of silver, and walked like a wind, as if he had made a fortune.\"Luo Shuyu asked: \"Where is his hometown?\"Qingwang: \"I asked about this. It's not far from the capital. I have to ask someone to find it. Young master, what do we do next? Do you eant to find this doctor?\"Luo Shuyu tapped the desktop, as expected, there were many problems in it.However, finding this doctor seemed to be of no use. Liu Shi wouldn't admit what she had done. Doctor Liang may also moved early. After so many years, Luo Renshou would rather protect her. He had no direct evidence pointing to anyone. The two of them were in a tacit understanding on the point that \"the husband sings and the woman follow him\". Without Luo Renshou's permission, how dare Liu Shi used his mother's dowry.He investigated the doctor was only to confirm whether there was any doubt about his mother's sudden death.Was it Liu Shi who really started, or was there someone else?At present, Liu Shi was the biggest suspect, but what if Luo Renshou killed the donkey? Thinking of this possibility, Luo Shuyu's heart became colder.The book was about the process of Shen Mingyun\u2019s relationship with a few big brothers and others. Luo's family had not written much. Only one sentence about Luo Shuyu\u2019s mother\u2019s introduction and related about her death. Liu Shi identity had been taken in one stroke.However, Luo Renshou benefited from Shen Mingyun. In Shen Mingyun's eyes, Luo Renshou was a gentle and humble uncle. He didn't doubt Luo Renshou's character until Shen Mingyun married the fourth prince and ascended to the throne became the queen. When Shen Mingyun reached the position of the queen, he also made a lot of effort in it. As for why Luo Renshou fancied Shen Mingyun and abandoned his own son, it was estimated that he was afraid of offending the power of several big men behind Shen Mingyun. The fisherman profited.After clarifying the relationship here, Luo Shuyu discovered that the Luo family were all standing on the opposite sides of him. No wonder he and Li Mingjin would become Shen Mingyun\u2019s first obstacle and the first target to be attacked when Shen Mingyun became the first queen of the Great Xia Kingdom.Since ancient times, no prince didn't covet the throne. Even if they didn't covet it, the reality would force people to stand in line. The princes had to find a way to save their lives, \"who knows if the new emperor will be the first to take them down\".In the book, Li Mingjin, who was paranoid, was the target of the princes. As for who brought him to hell, it was still unknown.Luo Shuyu listed his current situation and the safety issues that needed to be resolved on a piece of paper.One must prevent Li Mingjin from becoming a target among the princes again; second, both Li Mingjin and him must stay away from Shen Mingyun; the third was to destroy all opportunities for Shen Mingyun.These three points were not simple, especially the third point. The combination of several big brothers in the book directly or indirectly helped the fourth prince ascended to the throne. This process inevitably caused the people to be displaced and became hungry. It was just a book. It was not written clearly, but as a person who really lived in this world, Luo Shuyu could imagine that because Shen Mingyun wanted to plant some kind of saplings, a certain boss bought a mountain for him, leading to the villagers who originally lived there had to leave their homes and found another way out. Why he knew about this, because he was out to breathe at the time and just happened to bump into it.\"Don't use it for the time being, the world is so big, if he moves, finding someone is like finding a needle in the haystack. I remember my father's xiemu today, I'll go see him.\" Luo Shuyu stopped writing, crumpled the paper in his hand and threw it into the brazier.(xiemu = to take a curtain call, (fig.) to come to an end)Qingwang recently discovered that his young master had changed quite a lot. He wrote very carefully, fearing that it might be stolen. He didn't understand why it was so sudden.As soon as they entered the door of the study, they saw that Grandma Feng was discussing with the cook about making cakes.Grandma Feng: \"Young master, are you going to go out?\"Luo Shuyu: \"I'm going to see my father.\"Grandma Feng said: \"Young master, I let someone make some cold cakes for you, I can bring them to Master Luo to taste.\"Luo Shuyu thought about it, he still had to take Li Mingjin into consideration, and he still had to act like a filial father and son, before he could really tear his skin.This cold cake seemed to be newly developed by the chef, and the taste was a little weird. He didn't like to eat it. If he brought it to Luo Renshou now, it wouldn't be wasted.Looking for Luo Renshou was not because he really cared about him, but to get back his mother's dowry.Grandma Feng followed Luo Shuyu out with the cold cake.Luo Shuyu had seen Grandma Feng's abilities in his previous life, and knew that she was very strict with the rules. Qingwang had been trained by her before, and within a few days he was reborn, as if he had changed his personal life. He understood Li Mingjin's intention to send them here.He remembered that Li Mingjin had also arranged Madam Feng to live in their yard in the last life. He thought it was for Grandma Feng to help him instead of being dissatisfied with him. If this was the case, wouldn't he misunderstand Li Mingjin? The more he thought about it, the more he felt that this possibility was very big.Qingwang reminded Luo Shuyu to go to the yard and asked him to pay attention to the threshold under his feet.Although Luo Renshou was the official of the Ministry of Etiquette, the Luo family didn't adhere too much to the etiquette. As soon as he entered the yard, he heard laughter from the hall. Hearing the voice, he knew that it was Liu Shi with her childrens who were accompanying Luo Renshou. The servants stepped forward to report to Luo Renshou.When Luo Shuyu saw Luo Renshou, the joy on his face had not been restrained, and the corners of his eyes were smiling.Seeing Grandma Feng behind Luo Shuyu, Luo Renshou's smile gradually reduced. He asked Luo Shuyu very kindly: \"Why did Shuyu come here?\"Luo Shuyu randomly made up a reason: \"The weather has been quite bad in recent days. It\u2019s hot. I heard that my father\u2019s appetite is not very good. I will send you some cold cakes to relieve the heat.\u201dLuo Renshou said, \u201cI\u2019m interested.\u201dLuo Shuyu naturally ignored Liu Shi and others, and then said, \u201cFather, I came here today because I thought about the warehouse and would check my mother's dowry. Grandma Feng said that I have never taken care of the account at home, I can just practice with the dowry first so that I can manage the affairs of the house by then.\"The reason he gave was very sufficient, Luo Renshou had no reason to refuse, and he promised it on the day of the decree came down.When Liu Shi heard this, he gave Luo Renshou a wink, and Luo Renshou had idea. After he gave Liu Shi the key to the warehouse, he didn't know how much she had embezzled. He told her to return one by one the other day. Luo Renshou's heart was cold at the moment.Luo Renshou hesitated for a moment: \"I will find this list in the study, and I will send someone to show it to you later.\"Luo Shuyu chuckled without warmth : \"Don't bother my father, I have the dowry list, and just give me the key to the warehouse. \"Liu Shi blurted out:\" how do you have the list of dowry?. \"Luo Shu Yu:\" how I have my mother's dowry list, I don't have to elaborate on it\"Liu Shi covered his lips with a handkerchief, smiled and quickly explained: \"I'm just curious, no other meaning.\" She was guilty and didn't dare to say more.Luo Renshou was calmer than Liu Shi, but he was also playing drums in his heart. In the past few days, he had to dealt with the affairs of the court and didn't ask about the dowry. Now Luo Shuyu suddenly came up, whether he would give it or not.\"Why do you have your mother's dowry list?\"Luo Shuyu said leisurely: \"Naturally it was left to me by my mother. Father, why bother to refuse it over and over again. Can you hand over the warehouse key to me now? Or the warehouse has been evacuated by those greedy jackals, used it privately for personal use, or subsidized relatives.\"Liu Shi was almost outraged by his scolding, and kept patting her chest. Luo Shuyao couldn't see that his mother was being ridiculed, he said: \"Luo Shuyu, don't spray people with blood, who takes your mother's dowry! My mother is just kindly managing your dowry. You are a wolf-hearted bites Lu Dongbin, doesn't know good people! It's hard to say who is a jackal! \"(L\u00fc Dongbin (796-), Tang Dynasty scholar, one of the Eight Immortals)Luo Shu Yu floating back to him:\" who is who should be. \"Luo Shuyao said out of anger:\" There is no evidence about the thing you say, I will fear flashed tongue! \"Carter, a voice outside the door Sounded.\"Wow, why are there such a crowd? What needs evidence? Are you playing a game of trial?\"This voice sounded very familiar, and Luo Shuyu didn't need to turn his head to know that Shen Mingyun, who had been detained for two days, appeared.Luo Shuyu probably guessed the reason for his coming here, and it must be related to his system mission.He thought, what would happen if Shen Mingyun couldn't complete the tasks given by the system?The author has something to say:The third prince: wife, fuck him! come on! \u2196(^\u03c9^)\u2197Luo Shuyu:......Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 Mission FailureThe sudden appearance of Shen Mingyun was like a timely rain for the Luo family.At this time, Luo Shuyu was aggressive and could force them to show their true shape at any time. With Shen Mingyun's disturbance, they could relax and thought about a relatively favorable countermeasure. From the day when Shen Mingyun moved into Luo\u2019s house, he often suddenly appeared in the place where various incidents and disputes occurred. He helped Luo Renshou solved the court problem, helped Liu Shi solved the family\u2019s balance of payments, and helped the housekeeper how to make the shop made revenue. They habitually turned one eye and closed one eye. The habit became natural, and they didn't care much about the details of Shen Mingyun's sudden appearance. Instead, they felt that it was normal for Shen Mingyun to appear at any time.Shen Mingyun shook a fan, pretending to be chic, and walked into the hall swayingly, looking crookedly like willow branches moved by the wind.Several young children in the Luo family liked to learn from his every move. They only thought that this was more topical than other young boys and girls. In Shen Mingyun's words, they were the front-end of fashion trends. He didn\u2019t know, Shen Mingyun would do this purely because he was originally a man. There were only men and women in his world. There were no gers. In fact he was dangling without a proper shape, and it was not good when he walked. How could he be an example?, He didn't like Luo Shuyu, it was better to say that Luo Shuyu didn't take him seriously from the bottom of his heart.Luo Shuyao was jealous of Luo Shuyu's appearance and \"advanced temperament\", so he had always been in the first place when it came to attack Luo Shuyu with outsiders.Before Liu Shi was promoted became the first wife, no matter how much Liu Shi was favored, he was the ger of a concubine, and Luo Shuyao was born in the name of the concubine. At that time, Luo Shuyao hated Luo Shuyu extremely. After Luo Shuyu became a ger, he still hated him, as if Luo Shuyu was born against him.At this time, Luo Shuyao was naturally closer to Shen Mingyun: \"Cousin, you came just right, you have always been fair, and give us a comment.\"Shen Mingyun's smile at this time was bright, coupled with his glamorous eyes, Luo Shuyu only thought about the smell of wind and dust.In the book, Shen Mingyun often talked about words such as \"Everyone is born equal\", \"Everyone is independent\",\u00a0 \"Everyone has rights and obligations\", etc., to endorse the nobleness, but in fact were not like this. Almost all the alternative words in his mind were \"indigenous\", \"ancient\", \"brain-handicapped\", \"stupid\", \"mentally retarded\" and other indecent words. Better, let him had a higher status and a more comfortable life.Luo Shuyu quietly watched Shen Mingyun's next performance.Obviously he learned the course of the matter from the system, but he showed a surprised expression: \"What's wrong with you? Everyone can discuss it if there is something.\"Luo Shuyu felt that Shen Mingyun was now like an aunt dealing with neighbourhood disputes, the more he looked like it. He raised his eyelids: \"Why, does my cousin have to get involved in our Luo family's affairs? Still feel that he has the ability to make decisions for my late mother, and you will even take advantage of the dead?\"Shen Mingyun was startled. What was Luo Shuyu talking about: \"What takes advantage of the dead?\"Luo Shuyu faintly buttoned him: \"I'm discussing my mother's dowry with my father. What do you mean by discussing it carefully? You also want to divide my mother's dowry?\"Shen Mingyun paused, and he quickly read the task panel in his mind, Luo Shuyu's mother's dowry, but the description of the information was not written like that.[Task content: Luo Renshou was asked for the dowry of his deceased wife, and the host need to help him solve the problem within one hour and help him regain the dowry of his deceased wife. After the task is completed, 50 mall coins will be awarded. ]System missions had never been wrong, and the mission descriptions were no problem, but it was Luo Shuyu who captured Luo Renshou\u2019s wife\u2019s dowry, is this wrong? No, the system couldn't be wrong, it had never been missed.Wasn't Luo Shuyu Luo Renshou's son? But there was no way to verify this. It was unscientific to recognize the parents by dripping blood, and DNA testing couldn't be done on-site.However, this time there were a lot of points. The small matter of dowry should be easy to solve. He had read a lot of zhaidou novels before, and he thought he could do it. Which one was not done well.It was the first time he received a task related to Luo Shuyu. In his opinion, Luo Shuyu was just a substitute for entering the Third Prince's Mansion for him, and what dowry he brought into the Third Prince's Mansion. However, he never forgot the face of the third prince, and it was a pity to give up. The best modern term for him was the top traffic personage.Shen Mingyun arrogantly said: \"Since the uncle is in charge of the dowry, why should you ask more? It seems that there is nothing wrong with the decision by the parents.\"Luo Shuyu confronted him for the first time, and his perception of Shen Mingyun's arrogance and unreasonableness went to the next level.There was only one way to deal with this kind of people. Luo Shuyu drank a sip of tea to moisturize his throat, and didn't worry a little bit: \"Your surname is Shen, my surname is Luo, what is the matter of our Luo family to you, what's the right for you to intervene here? My mother\u2019s dowry has no room for your beak. Even an honest official can hardly break housework. It\u2019s not your turn to speak. Cousin, you don't know the rules, it's better you go and take a look at the laws of our country. Let's consider whether you want to be the peacemaker.\"Shen Mingyun saw Luo Shuyu, a fake high-ranking scholar, said such long words to him for the first time. He really didn't understand Daxia's laws, but what about that, he could change it.He believed that there was always some truth in what he said: \"Rules are dead, and people are alive. Why do you have to do this for the sake of a dowry? Also, why don't I understand the laws of the Great Xia Kingdom?\"Luo Shuyu was not salty and indifferent. He smiled: \"If you don't understand, then you should close your mouth now instead of talking nonsense here.\" He turned his head and looked at Luo Renshou, \"As the official of the Ministry of Etiquette, father naturally knows Great Xia's etiquette and knows how to deal with the dowry.\"Luo Renshou was also quite faceless now. He was expecting Shen Mingyun to stir up a bit, but he never thought that he would say nothing. If he helped Shen Mingyun, it meant being scolded by Luo Shuyu. The official of the Ministry of Etiquette didn't understand etiquette, and he was taught by others. He was so embarrassed that he had to cover his face with his sleeve when he went out.As the last resort, Luo Renshou said to Shen Mingyun: \"Mingyun, you really should learn. You probably didn't have a good master in the country before. Tomorrow, let your aunt find a good master for you. Let's learn the rules first.\"Shen Mingyun was confused, He said: \"...Uncle, what did you just say to learn?\" Damn, he was here to help Luo Renshou, how could he has to learn how to behave, learned an egg, learned from him!Luo Shuyao on the side also pointed to Shen Mingyun\u2019s combat effectiveness. He was defeated in two rounds unexpectedly. Luo Shuyao was blocked by Luo Shuyu and was speechless. He was also accused of being unlearned by him. For the first time, he felt that his cousin Shen was too weak.Luo Renshou also felt that Shen Mingyun was a little stupid for the first time, and he didn't know how to look at people's faces, so he just shut up at this time.He looked at Luo Shuyu, who was sitting upright, and saw that he was generous and unpretentious. Luo Renshou couldn't help but compared him with Shen Mingyun, who was standing slantingly. It was the Luo family\u2019s child etiquette that was more polite. The family style of Bu Shangshu.Shen Mingyun was anxious, what did Luo Renshou mean? He couldn't complete the task without cooperating with himself! How to do? The previous tasks were all well completed, why is it a bit difficult today?No wonder it used to be 1 to 10 points, but today it suddenly became 50 points. It seemed that the difficulty had increased.Shen Mingyun talked to the system in his mind: \"System, can you give the rating for the task difficulty?\"System: \"Yes.\"Shen Mingyun: \"Today's task difficulty is how many stars.\"System: \"According to the highest level of difficulty is five stars, the difficulty of today's mission is three stars.\"Shen Mingyun: \"Hey! Such a simple plot task is worth three stars, and a broken dowry is worth three stars of medium difficulty.\"The system didn't give him any feedback.Shen Mingyun\u2019s words were not good, and Luo Renshou gave him a meal. Liu Shi began to become nervous. It was always the case that others stood and rushed forward. She hid behind and acted by a chance. Chen\u2019s dowry, it was really hard to say. She had used it a lot over the years, how did Luo Shuyu suddenly remembered this?Luo Shuyu didn't intend to give Shen Mingyun a chance to continue his mission. He wanted Shen Mingyun to watch his mission fail. At present, he could see that his face was getting stiffer and harder, and he had completely lost the familiar face of \"strategic planning\" in the past. Maybe he was scolding his mother in his heart. In the book, whenever Shen Mingyun encountered unsatisfactory things, he would always scold the sky and the ground, swearing one after another.Luo Shuyu looked at Liu Shi and Luo Renshou: \"Father, I was just disturbed by my cousin. Let\u2019s remember where we talked before. Didn\u2019t the fourth brother want the evidence to prove who is a jackal? Then I don\u2019t mind telling my cousin. The evidence is here.\" He said to Grandma Feng next to him, \"Grandma, please take off the hairpin on the fourth brother's head and have a look, and let them see what evidence is.\"Grandma Feng moved neatly and took two steps. He vigorously pulled Luo Shuyao over, and pulled out the white hosta from Luo Shuyao's head.Luo Shuyao listened to Shen Mingyun's method of eating less to keep in shape. He didn't eat enough in the morning. After being loosened by Grandma Feng, his figure swayed slightly and almost fell to the ground. He covered his head, his face flushed with anger: \" Luo Shuyu , don't deceive people too much, and return my hairpin!\"Grandma Feng used a clean veil and presented the white hosta to Luo Shuyu for a look: \"Master Luo.\"Luo Shuyu said, \"This white hosta is given to the fourth younger brother by Aunt Liu?\"\"That's right.\" Luo Shuyao said with extreme anger: \"So what! This is just an ordinary hairpin, give it back to me!\"Luo Shuyu observed Liu Shi increasingly pale face, and chuckled, \"All those present are witnesses. Cousin, please listen carefully. This white hosta is given by Aunt Liu to the fourth brother.\" He said to Grandma Feng again, \"Come on, grandma, look at it, is there a Yuxiangji hairpin words in it?\"Grandma Feng stepped forward and looked at it again: \" Go back to the young master, there are three words for Yuxiangji\"Luo Shuyu didn't look at Liu Shi's pale face , but looked at Luo Renshou with smile, deliberately asked him: \"Then father wants to have a test?\"Luo Renshou sitting in the seat didn't say a word, and Luo Shuyu continued: \"Presumably you also know the rules of Yuxiangji. A piece of jade ornament will be registered in a book every time it is sold, in quadruplicate, one in the branch, one in the main store, the owner of Yuxiangji also holds one copy, and the buyer will also have it as apraisal. If this evidence is not enough, I would like to find out more in the residence of Aunt Liu, the eldest brother, Luo Shuyue, Luo Shuyao, and Liu's family. Father, what do you think?\"If it weren't for sitting, Luo Renshou could now put on a dangling scene, and then fainted, pretending that he was not here.Luo Renshou was forced to do so, knowing that he allowed Liu Shi to embezzle his dowry and he could no longer cover up, he suddenly slapped the table and said angrily: \"Liu Shi! You are so brave, you dare to steal it. Misappropriating Chen's dowry! Come! Send your madam back to the yard, and you can't be discharged from the room for half a month without my permission!\"Liu Shi cried out, \"Master!\"The master was trying to put the charge on her! Do you want to abandon the car and protect your pawn!She was anxious and rolled her eyes and fainted. Luo Shuyue and Luo Shuyao quickly helped her: \"Mother!\"Luo Shuyu didn't bother to watch them play, and asked Luo Renshou directly: \"Father, can you give me the key to the warehouse? \"Luo Renshou looked decadent:\" Naturally, give you. \"At the same time, the sound system sounded on Shen mingyun mind: host couldn't finish the \"keep dowry \" mission, mission failed.Shen Mingyun was very surprised: The mission failed? !After getting a satisfactory answer, Luo Shuyu watched the chaotic scene and admired everyone's expressions. Suddenly he found it interesting and wanted to find someone to share.That night, Li Mingjin received a letter from Luo Shuyu, which was still very brief.[Today is very happy. Luo Shuyu]Li Mingjin's gloomy face had a little more distress: Why is it already finished?The author has something to say: Third Prince: Wife, the letter is too short, write a little longer!Luo Shuyu: No.Third prince: /(\u3112o\u3112)/~~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 Hidden Side TasksHe still remembered that when Luo Shuyu married to the Third Prince, Liu Shi still helped him took care of the dowry at that time. The dowry was at the level of an ordinary ger's marriage, plus the bride price from the Third Prince's Mansion was barely enough. To deal with the past, Luo Shuyu at the time didn't have any opinion on this. Besides, he was actually not very good at making demands from others. What's more, he deeply felt that Luo Renshou was an official of courtesy, and his family was not as wealthy as others. These things didn't matter.After opening his mother's dowry storeroom, he felt how stupid he was back then, and how long Luo Renshou fooled him.His mother was a real Shili Hongzhuang (an example female with splendid clothing) back then. These boxes were still here. Even if it was embezzled by Liu Shi, the big objects were still there. She didn't dare to take it out blatantly. They were all first-class.It was really embarrassing. If he didn't suddenly mad at Luo Renshou, would this dowry still be misappropriated by them? He as a son was really sorry for his deceased mother, and blamed him for believing in those ill-intentioned and vipers hearted person.Fortunately, it was not too late.How did he get his mother's dowry list, thanks to the official lady in the previous life who mentioned to him the mink robe worn by Luo Shuyao.After returning from the rebirth, Luo Shuyu immediately asked Qingwang to send someone to find his maternal grandfather\u2019s family. Although the Chen family was gone, the camel was bigger than the horse and used to be a big family. Even if the family moved out of the capital, They still had a place in the capital. Through several shops, Luo Shuyu found his mother's nanny. A few days ago, she was invited to Luo Mansion to meet Luo Shuyu quietly. The other party handed him a box in tears, saying that she had been waiting for the young lady\u2019s child to come to her, and inside it was a list of Chen\u2019s dowry and a signed letter.The letter was written by his grandfather to his mother, but unfortunately his mother couldn't afford it after they left Beijing. This difference was the eternal separation of heaven and a man. He had never seen this letter. If he was not born again, he would miss it again. The content of the letter was not long, mainly he hoped that she could take good care of herself without worrying about her parents, her brother and others. Even if they were sent back to their ancestral home, they would have a good life.The Chen family was also the best in the capital back then. It was the emperor's favorite person, but the emperor's grace would always be outdated, and it would be easy to be remembered when it became famous. Then something happened and Luo Shuyu's grandfather was removed from Beijing.The nanny said that she went to Luo Mansion to find his mother, but the people from Luo Mansion drove her out twice, always looking for reasons not to let them see each other. They said that they were afraid that the Chen family would hurt the Luo family. In fact, something was hidden from the Chen family.Luo Shuyu calculated the time. The nanny went to Luo Mansion to find his mother after the Chen\u2019s incident had settled. After carefully calculating the time, his mother was already sick at that time, and the condition was extremely bad. It didn\u2019t take long and she passed away. When the nanny came back, she only learned the news of her death. Because of this, the letter entrusted by his grandfather was never sent out until Luo Shuyu sent someone to find her.Now, ten years after his mother's death, the Chen family had also left Beijing for many years.If Luo Shuyu had not been reborn and had not read the book, perhaps he would never know that his grandfather left a letter to his mother and this dowry list.Luo Shuyu personally checked the warehouse. When Luo Renshou handed him the warehouse key, Luo Shuyu also emphasized that all things that Liu Shi took away must be moved back, otherwise he would use silver to make up for the lost part. His mother never opened the warehouse. After her death, the good things were ruined by these people. The dowry not only raised these people, they also used the dowry to bully her son. If his mother was alive in the sky, she would be so angry that she wanted to jump out of the coffin.Luo Shuyu didn't know when Liu Shi started to manage this warehouse, so there would only be few things in it.He re-listed the dowry in the warehouse and compared it with the original dowry list one by one, and wrote down everything that was not here. With the people brought by Grandmother Feng, the inventory speed was accelerated. It took two days to sort out everything, and the missing part was written and handed to Luo Renshou.Luo Renshou pretended to lock up Liu Shi that day because he was afraid that Luo Shuyu would cause an incident. There would be two major consequences of the incident. One was that he had no face, and the other was that if outsiders knew that the present official of the Ministry of Etiquette was greedy for his wife\u2019s dowry. He was used to subsidize his family, and he was known by the censor that he hadn't participated in any problem. The image of an upright official he had built over the years was afraid that it would not exist. It was estimated that his official career would end here, and he could not make any further progress.With the checklist, Luo Shuyu appeared in Luo Renshou's study. He came to be held accountable and demanded compensation.Luo Renshou saw Luo Shuyu and felt toothache. He didn't want to meet him at all, and he felt that he (LSY) was like a soul who haunting him and only wanted his life.From the day when he received the imperial decree of marriage, he hadn't been comfortable for a day, and he was one of the first two big people around the dowry of his deceased wife.\"Father, this is a list of the dowry's items that the warehouse lacks. I won't say much about anything else. The key is in your hands. You know that the person who embezzled is Liu Shi, better than me. I don't know whether or not you have embezzled the things and use a little bit on me. I came here today just hoping to get back the dowry She took out, otherwise I can only come to the door to get things back. My face may be thicker than yours, and I don\u2019t think you want to see it either.\u201dLuo Renshou was blocked by his preemptive move.He only started to look straight at this son, who had been quiet and uncompromising since childhood. In retrospect, he mostly took a perfunctory attitude towards this son, and rarely cared about him. But on the day when the decree came down, he became another person.It turned out that, it was not he didn't like to fight or grab, but the marriage to the third prince gave him this opportunity.Besides, when he wanted to return to Chen's dowry, he couldn't make any mistakes from the etiquette point of view. This was what made Luo Renshou felt aggrieved. He was angry and unwilling to attack him. Luo Shuyu was morally speaking with him. He had nothing wrong when it came to this matter.Luo Renshou thought about it, and once again pushed all his faults to Liu Shi's head: \"Liu's family is born in a small family and has no insight. Seeing money, it will inevitably be a little greedy. I will make up for these when I look back.\"\"You have a hard time, father.\" Luo Shuyu thought, talking about money hurt the feelings, but once there was no feelings, he could only talk about money, \"Father will be fair and not biased.\"Luo Renshou was suddenly given a high hat by him . It couldn't make him upset, but very upset, so he sent someone to call the steward.In fact, when Luo Shuyu went to find Luo Renshou, he sent someone to call the steward in advance. Luo Renshou's words for a kind father came before he had time to export the steward. It was impossible to play the emotional card. Luo Shuyu did not smile at him now.Although the steward was a servant, he had worked in Luo's family longer than Luo Shuyu's age. Luo Renshou usually followed Luo Shuyu's attitude to him. He had never cared much about Luo Shuyu. In turn, the butler also didn't respectfully respected Luo Shuyu, daring to make trouble.Luo Renshou asked him: \"How did you do the things I asked you to do the last two days?\"When the steward saw Luo Shuyu, he knew which one Luo Renshou was referring to. All the people in the family should know about the dowry of the young master's birth mother. Everyone said that the sudden change in his temperament was because the madam (LSY's mother) gave him a dream, otherwise, it was too strange that one would no longer tolerate it. The steward had been in the Luo family for many years, and his heart trembled slightly after seeing more private matters. He came along and wondered if he had done anything to be sorry for him, and now facing Luo Shuyu, he didn't dare to speak with his head held up as usual.the steward: \"Going back to the master, I packed all the items that I can retrieve in the boxes. The eldest , the second, the fourth, the fifth, and the sixth, I have all looked for it. Now they are locked in the warehouse, and I didn't dare to move.\"Luo Renshou \"The next one will send all people to move it to Shu Yu's yard.\"The steward: \"Yes, this is the list. Please let the master and the third young master go through it.\"He wrote two copies, one for Luo Renshou and one for Luo Shuyu.Luo Shuyu quickly glanced at the retrieved dowry list and evoked a shallow sneer. It seemed that Liu Shi was not very cooperative. When he checked the warehouse, it was less than 30%. What was recovered was only a little bit of the 30% of the fur, which was completely couldn't afford to splash.Luo Renshou frowned, \"Just this?\"What does Liu Shi mean? He is losing face at Luo Shuyu every day, and she still doesn't know how to share his worries for him! Still hiding at this time!The steward said, \"Madam said that's all.\"Luo Renshou patted the list on the table: \"She's so bold!\"Luo Shuyu thought that Luo Renshou would still be here to show him the show, which was really boring.The Steward: \"Master, this...\"Luo Renshou looked at Luo Shuyu: \"Shu Yu, I will let Liu Shi give you an account tomorrow, and whatever is it will be returned to you.\"Luo Shuyu did not give Luo Renshou room for bargaining, pointing to each the price behind the item: \"Father, you don\u2019t have to force it if you can\u2019t find it. I won\u2019t say anything about my mother\u2019s dowry. I just hope that my mother will be at ease below and don\u2019t have to worry about me. There are corresponding values at the back of the missing list I gave you. They are all converted, and if you can\u2019t find them. You can make up for them at the price above. Aunt Liu\u2019s younger brother bought a lot of properties outside with your reputation, presumably our family\u2019s money has been fed out. As for my dowry, you can take care of it. It doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t have it, I think the third prince won't be too difficult for our family.\"Luo Renshou was surprised when he heard him mention Liu Shi's younger brother. How did Luo Shuyu know? He didn't even know that Liu Shi still had something to hide from him! Later, when he saw the silver converted from the used dowry, the cold sweat almost shed from his forehead, but he could only pretend to be calm, and it seemed reasonable for Luo Shuyu not to talk to him.He pretended to be very helpless and sighed: \"Okay, I'm sorry for this matter, and I'm sorry for your mother and you. I will convert it into money and shop for you. I will deal with this matter the day after tomorrow at the latest. You, over the years, it was also my negligence.\"He would also settle the account of Liu Shi's subsidy to his brother.Luo Shuyu refused to pick him up. He just listened blankly. Luo Renshou felt at a loss. His emotional cards hit the south wall. He was a bit embarrassed. If he had been in the past, he could still rebuke Luo Shuyu, but now, it was different now.At this time, the outside servant gave report about the eldest young master and Shen young master came over together.Luo Shuyu raised his eyelids, and the relationship between eldest brother and Shen Mingyun was as good as ever.Liu Shi had two sons, the eldest brother Luo Shumo, and the second brother Luo Shuhan.Luo Renshou said immediately: \"Let them in.\"If Luo Shumo and Luo Shuhan came to Luo Renshou's yard together, Luo Shuyu will temporarily avoid it, but Shen Mingyun was also there. He had a reason to stay and didn't seem to need to deliberately avoid it. He wanted to know what Shen Mingyun started doing again.Shen Mingyun's system released a task\u00a0 very quickly.As soon as the two came in, they saw Luo Shuyu leisurely drinking tea.Luo Renshou wanted to send Luo Shuyu back, but he was embarrassed by what happened just now, and he really couldn't say it.Luo Shumo called Luo Shuyu: \"Shu Yu.\"Luo Shuyu didn't have a deep impression of this elder brother. He only knew that he had been close to the eldest prince and the second brother got in touch with the crown prince.Luo Renshou was able to reach the position of Shangshu in the officialdom. His mind was not bad. The eldest son was close to the prince, and the second son was close to the crown prince. No one was guilty. If everyone asked only that they were doing things for the emperor.The current adult princes were the eldest prince, the crown prince, the third prince, and the fourth prince. The most likely to get the throne was the crown prince, but the emperor was not very fond of the crown prince , because the eldest prince\u2019s biological mother, Lin Guifei is the most favored by the emperor. Everything was possible.So, Luo Shumo and Shen Mingyun, who were close to the eldest prince, came to find Luo Renshou for anything important?Luo Shuyu smiled slightly at Luo Shumo. With sharp eyes, he seemed to ask unintentionally: \"Big brother, where are you guys, there is mud on the corners of your clothes.\"When he asked, Shen Mingyun gave a slight look because of him. The familiar system task prompt sounded in his mind at this moment.[The host triggers a special hidden side mission: Please stop the wedding of the third prince Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu on August 10 as soon as possible. Task reward: 200 mall coins. ]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 See You TomorrowThere were more than 800,000 words in the book \"After Transmigrating Into a Book, Four Big Brothers Are Fighting Into Marry Me\". Luo Shuyu only read it once. There were many details in it. The system also sent Shen Mingyun big and small tasks.The system tasks were divided into the main tasks and the side tasks.The trigger points of the main tasks were all on the fourth prince, while the side tasks were events that may affect the progress of the main tasks or to promote the main tasks. Shen Mingyun had never used his brain to remember it, he was very dependent on the system, and he would do all the tasks released by the system. He didn\u2019t choose too much. According to him, the more mall coins, the better. The props were his most advantageous protection tool. It would be wasteful to have a system that was not used well.But Shen Mingyun hadn\u2019t received any special hidden tasks, nor he heard the system mentioned it before. This was the first time. He was a bit surprised, but when he was playing games, he also had the hidden tasks. Think about it, he just thought it was normal. This wouldn't affect his life. If the task succeed, he would get 200 more mall coins. It didn\u2019t matter if the task failed, because this system was very friendly to him and there was no punishment.Shen Mingyun was still looking forward to the hidden task that suddenly appeared, 200 points could be exchanged for an item he had always wanted to get.At this time, the eyes he looked at Luo Shuyu were different. This person was completely the NPC he scored, and it was too easy to use.However, he changed his mind and thought, Luo Shuyu had nothing special, why did he suddenly trigger the hidden task? Perhaps the key point was not on him, but the third prince. Shen Mingyun now regretted that he broke his fate with the third prince, but if he didn't hand over Luo Shuyu's eight characters, this task would not appear, right? It shouldn't be difficult to do sabotage, just completed the task!Shen Mingyun was thinking about the pros and cons of doing the task, but Luo Shuyu thought about certain things through the muddy water on their bodies. He remembered what Shen Mingyun and Luo Shumo did today in the book.This incident was related to a water conservancy project. Luo Shumo worked under the eldest prince, and also found a small position in the Ministry of Engineering.They were going to try Shen Mingyun's previous proposal to transform the keel waterwheel, and the design drawings were produced by the system.However, the transformation process didn't go smoothly. There was an accident when they went to the site for a test today. Both of them were poured with muddy water, which was what Luo Shuyu saw before. However, it was finally rebuilt after many trials.In this matter, the eldest prince did a very good job, he was praised by the emperor, and won many rewards. Luo Shumo also handled things smoothly, was promoted, and the family was beaming, and it helped Liu Shi became confidence, the whole family complimented her for having given birth to a good son, who would be the pillar of the Luo family in the future.Luo Shumo also became Shen Mingyun's future helper. Although he had friendship with the eldest prince, but after the eldest prince was pulled off the horse, Luo Shumo was completely free to help the fourth prince in his early years and was involved in any way. In the book, after Shen Mingyun became a queen, he was also promoted to be a nobleman because of his merits in escorting him, and he was the beneficiary after catching up on Shen Mingyun's line.It was a good thing that the newly renovated keel waterwheel could solve the problem of the people\u2019s water difficulties, but Shen Mingyun was not generous. He suggested that since he made the design drawings for renovation, he would charge a patent fee. He suggested that the court should use his plan. They charge a certain waterwheel usage tax. Shen Mingyun's proposal was approved by a large number of officials, and even the emperor listened to the suggestions of the eldest prince and the fourth prince and agreed to impose a new waterwheel usage tax.The newly increased waterwheel usage tax greatly increased the burden on the people. These years had been drought and the harvest not very good. When Luo Shuyu heard about this incident, he felt that it was not quite right, but he was not involved in government affairs. Even Luo Renshou's study he seldom went in.When he was out wandering, he occasionally heard some complaints from passers-by. Later, he entered the Third Prince's Mansion. Knowing this, it was because of the waterwheel tax that something had happened. The Emperor sent Li Mingjin to bring troops to suppress it. It was said that many people died, and the poor people suffered even more.Luo Shuyu also accidentally heard from a conversation with the officials who dealt with the matter and realized that the matter about waterwheel tax was so big that it became a \"waterwheel incident\", and because of this incident Li Mingjin had reputation for tyrannical and wanton to harm the people, and in the court there were more complaining about him. The officials also impeached him many times. The emperor was very troubled, and then ordered him to reflect on the mansion for a month. After that, Li Mingjin, who had nothing to do, drank outside every day. Accidentally, after taking the medicine given by others, he slept with Luo Shuyu. Their children came at that time.This matter had a lot to do with Li Mingjin. Luo Shuyu had to work hard to recall the details in the book. There were 800,000 words in the book. Thanks to the author's clear writing of many details, Luo Shuyu, who was reading the book at the time, also deliberately kept the description of the drawings in his mind with his insights. Now as long as he concentrated on thinking back, those words would come to his mind.Luo Shumo inherited Luo Renshou's style, and he did a lot of superficial work, and he didn't have much feasts with Luo Shuyu. He smiled and said: \"It's just some fortifications. I'm looking for father to discuss the countermeasures.\"Luo Shuyu saw them panic, but there was no joy on his face. He guessed that their waterwheel had not been remodeled yet, \"That's it, then I won't bother you.\"Luo Shuyu had an idea in his heart, \"You are busy.\"Luo Shuyu walked out of Luo Renshou's study, and Shen Mingyun suddenly chased him out and took Luo Shuyu's arm. Luo Shuyu thought that he (SMY) was originally a man and opened a distance.\"My cousin just talk about things when you have something. I'm not used to being too close to others.\" After talking, he slapped his hand and said, \"Please take care of yourself.\"Shen Mingyun cursed in his heart . It was dewy, he was about to become the third princess and his temper was so big. Didn\u2019t he just touch his hand, as if he was about to kill him, he was still shocked by the task he received, and subconsciously wanted to talk to him. Talking about the third prince, he really didn't know what to do.Shen Mingyun reluctantly put a smile on his face: \"I just want to tell you something, why do you stay thousands of miles away?\"Luo Shuyu's face was pale: \"Then you have something to say.\"He didn't want to say it if it weren't for the task. Shen Mingyun said, \"Luo Shuyu, I just want to tell you about the third prince's external opinion, don't treat others kindness as donkey liver and lungs.\"When he heard this, Luo Shuyu smiled: \"That cousin is really kind.\"Shen Mingyun was pretty sure that Luo Shuyu didn't know that he had given his eight characters to the harem noble concubine, but Luo Shuyu's smile made him very uncomfortable.\"Of course I am kind. If you don't want to marry the third prince, I can actually help you.\"The weasel was not at ease in paying a New Year's greeting to the rooster. Luo Shuyu didn't know what his plan was, staring at him and asked: \"Oh? Why do you suddenly think want to help me?\"\"I can help you escape your marriage.\" Wasn't it often written like this in the TV dramas? When the heroine didn't want to marry someone she didn't like, she escaped most of the time.Luo Shuyu was amused by Shen Mingyun. He used to listen to him saying swear words, but now he still listened to him saying nonsense like a lunatic: \"Do you want to help me out of marriage? Do you know what it is? This is a serious crime that hurts the family. Cousin, you have to think about it clearly. The lighter\u00a0 charge is that father is removed from office, and the more serious is that you are asked to be cut off and your family was ransacked. You might even be beheaded. You are also in the nine clan.\" He wiped his neck, his eyes piercing Shen Mingyun like an ice arrow.Shen Mingyun was frightened by Luo Shuyu's eyes and took a step back, and smiled awkwardly: \"He, he, I just said casually, if you don't want to marry, we can think of other ways, then let the third prince divorce the marriage arrangement.\"Luo Shuyu bent the corners of his lips and gave Shen Mingyun an unexpected response: \"How do you know that I don't want to marry into the Third Prince's Mansion? I still want to marry in Feng guang. Does my cousin have any thoughts about the Third Prince?\"[feng guang = to be well-regarded, to be well-off, grand, impressive]Shen Mingyun: \"How can I possibly have any thoughts about that kind of cruel people!\" Only you were a fool who was willing to marry him. If it wasn't for the mall coins, would he be like this?Luo Shuyu stared at him very displeased: \"Shen Mingyun, pay attention to your words, Li Mingjin is not something you can talk about.\"Shen Mingyun thought that he could speak eloquently, but Luo Shuyu's eyes were full of loopholes. He said: \"You really don't know what's good or bad, I'm just reminding you.\"\"That's really thank you.\" Luo Shuyu didn't want to talk to him much, turned around and left, no matter what Shen Mingyun muttered behind him, it was nothing more than some complaining words.After returning to Ruyiyuan, Luo Shuyu immediately calmed down and sorted out Shen Mingyun's changes just now.He didn't have many face-to-face confrontations with Shen Mingyun in his previous life. This time Shen Mingyun took the initiative to mention Li Mingjin to him, and also said something malicious to him, and wanted to \"help\" him escape the marriage. What did it mean? He wanted to ruin his wedding with Li Mingjin?As far as he knew, apart from doing tasks, Shen Mingyun wouldn't take the initiative to approach a person.He remembered it was written in the book that once, Shen Mingyun and the fourth prince fell down a cliff together. They were rescued by nearby villagers. The fourth prince was injured. In order to live in a village, to eat and drink, Shen Mingyun extremely reluctantly did the tasks to earn shopping mall points to buy food. The task was to help the old people in the village and teach children with runny noses to read. On the one hand, he kindly taught them, on the other hand, he disliked them very much because they were dirty and sloppy.Shen Mingyun never bothered to make faces to people he didn't like, and suddenly showed goodness, there must be something else.Luo Shuyu thought left and right, writing a line in the notebook, Shen Mingyun's task must hope that this wedding wouldn't be held.He remembered very clearly that there was no task about him and Li Mingjin in the book, and since he got married, Shen Mingyun had no intersection with him. As for whether Shen Mingyun had any tasks related to the third prince after marriage, he didn't know.No matter what, he must be careful of this person now, his system was very evil, and it shouldn't be a serious fairy object.Now let\u2019s write down the description of the waterwheel in the system and gave it to Li Mingjin. After the test of the previous life, he was convinced that Grandma Feng was a credible person. The content of the book, those words would come to his mind clearly, and he could silently remember it without missing a word.He would give these to Li Mingjin, but how should he explain his knowledge of this waterwheel? Would Li Mingjin treat him as a spy sent by someone else?Looking at the blueprints that were just finished, Luo Shuyu was a little worried. Would Li Mingjin trust him completely?Qingwang reminded Luo Shuyu: \"Young master, it's time to rest.\"Luo Shuyu finally decided to write an appointment letter to Li Mingjin. The drawing was too important to be passed on to others at will. If it was intercepted by others, it was difficult for him to explain, Li Mingjin also, In fact although his reputation now\u00a0 was average, compared to the later years of his life, it was obvious that his current bad reputation was not enough.If Li Mingjin wanted to fight for that position, he would show him the best.Luo Shuyu handed the letter asking Li Mingjin to meet him to Grandma Feng and passed it to Li Mingjin overnight.Third Prince's Mansion.Ansan once again got into the study room from the window.Li Mingjin, who hadn't yet fallen asleep, opened the sandalwood scented note paper, and the corners of his mouth curled up in an unnoticeable arc.In the letter, Luo Shuyu asked him to meet him in Fumanlou at noon tomorrow.His imperial concubine was so eager to see him, it was only a few days since the last separation, was he acting like a baby to him?Ansan, who was about to leave, was suddenly called to a halt: \"Ansan, what clothes do you think I wear for tomorrow?\"Ansan looked at the third prince who was twisting the letter paper with a calculating face: \"...\" There was no object to the humble duty, I don't know.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m The Vicious Cannon Fodder In The BookCH 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the day of going out, the sky was beautiful and clear.The national style of Daxia was still open. The gers and women were very casual when they went out. Many women could fall in love with men freely and chose to marry the people they like. As long as they could have a good talk, it was successful. However, most of the marriage contracts were based on the words of the matchmaker ordered by the parents, and when they are old enough, the parents in the family would make arrangements for the marriage.Because of Luo Shuyu\u2019s decree of marriage in the front of the Luo family, Liu Shi marriage requirements for their children also became higher. Luo Shuyu could be favored by the royal family, and her children may not be unmatched, at least they must be worthy scholarly family.Luo Shuyu was not very concerned about these things in his previous life, but in this life, he should know everything that should be known, and try to find out what should be known. There were intersections between Shen Mingyun and Luo's family, which would affect Luo Shuyu's life more or less. Good or bad, this was the conclusion he drew from the book. Whoever had more positive connections with Shen Mingyun would get more benefits. If anyone sang against Shen Mingyun, then what awaited them was a miserable end.In the full text, because they sang against Shen Mingyun and became the villains, there were not a few families who had gone down. Not only that, but there were many incidents of family destruction, wives scattered, and parents abandoning children. Wanted to change the trajectory of these things, the road was blocked.Luo Shuyu's most important thing now was to take care of his small family first, and other things had to be considered in long-term.He put on his sun hat and went out with Qingwang.However, he went out with his front foot, and Shen Mingyun drove to go out on a date in his back foot immediately. Today, he was still radiant, like a peacock with the screen.After Luo Shuyu came back from his rebirth, he had never been out of Luo Mansion, and Qingwang passed on to him any news outside.The main street, which hadn't been greatly influenced by Shen Mingyun, was still full of the shouts of small vendors.In fact, the people were thinking about how to find a way to live better for their families every day. They really didn't care who the people in the power, and whoever could make their lives better they would support them.The carriage drove towards the main street. Luo Shuyu didn't want to be extravagant, and went straight to Fumanlou. The private room was reserved by Li Mingjin. No one would dare to stop the third prince from meeting hi future wife.It coincided with the market today, and there were a lot more people coming to the city. The first floor of Fumanlou was full of guests. Xiaoer actively greeted the guests in the lobby. The sound of the wine glasses touched together into the word \"lively\".[xiao er = waiter]Vaguely, Luo Shuyu also heard someone praising Li Bai\u2019s \"Wang Lushan Waterfall\", \"Drinking Alone under the Moon\" and other poems for its wonderful features. He also heard someone saying \"A toast to invite the bright moon\", and \"the shadow of three people\" and other poems.Luo Shuyu was taken to the second floor private room by Xiaoer, and it was much quieter on the second floor. Each private room was separated independently.He didn't come here many times. During the pregnancy in his last life, Li Mingjin gave him a lot of food from this place when he passed by in the winter.Li Mingjin told him that he only bought it along the way. Now that he thought about it carefully, Fumanlou and the Third Prince's Mansion were basically two opposite directions, one south and the other north.Luo Shuyu took off the sun hat and gave it to Qingwang, thinking about how Li Mingjin didn't let the food he brought back to the house became cold in the cold winter.As soon as he arrived, the noise outside suddenly became quiet, and Qingwang just poured the tea for Luo Shuyu.The door was pushed open, and a man in white clothes with a folding fan in his hand appeared in front of Luo Shuyu. His lips were free and unrestrained, as if walking out of the painting.This young master Pian Pian was no one else, but Li Mingjin, the third prince who came to the appointment.[pian pian = elegant\u00a0 graceful, smart, to dance lightly]Today's dress was very different from his previous style, and no one would associate Li Mingjin with this one, who was so gentle and without a whip.Even Luo Shuyu almost swiped Qingwang's tea, his hands trembled, and the first sentence of the meeting was: \"How do you wear this outfit?\"He had never seen Li Mingjin dressed up like this before. His clothes were mainly dark, and he rarely wore such bright clothes. However, he had never seen Li Mingjin before he got married. Maybe he was dressed like this at that time when he was still young.An angry horse in a fresh clothes was a juvenile temperament, and now Li Mingjin was no more than eighteen years old.Li Mingjin sat down opposite Luo Shuyu, very calmly: \"Don't you like it?\"Luo Shuyu shook his head and chuckled, his eyebrows relaxed: \"No, I'm not used to it. I saw you wore black clothes last time.\"Ansan opened the window in the private room, and the breeze was blowing slowly, which was very comfortable.Li Mingjin thought that Luo Shuyu smiled happily. He should like his clothes today. Last night, he stayed up all night to read the scripts circulated among the gers and ladies. It was true that the gers and ladies inside the scripts liked the handsome men in white and rode a white horse to go out.No one thought that the two would meet again before they got married. For Luo Shuyu, it was a very unexpected experience. How much he had missed in his previous life. Seeing Li Mingjin before getting married, he both cherished and regretted. He cherished him now and regretted that he didn't know much about him in his previous life, he was really not a qualified princess.\"I see.\" Li Mingjin moved the pastry that Xiaoer had just brought up to Luo Shuyu, \"try it.\"This was the mung bean cold cake that Luo Shuyu liked to eat in the summer . It was soft and fragrant, and the entrance was melted. After one piece, Li Mingjin continued to stare at him again.Luo Shuyu was a little younger, with red lips and white teeth. He smiled cleanly. There was a shallow pear nest on the right side of his mouth. The light green clothes fit on him just right, one more point looked flamboyant, one point not too pale , whatever you look at was good.Luo Shuyu was a little embarrassed to be stared straight by him, but the corners of his mouth couldn't help rising: \"Don't eat it now, I will have to eat other thing later. I heard that the braised elbows here are particularly delicious.\"\"You also like to eat braised elbows?\" Li Mingjin was obviously very surprised. He didn't know this at all when he investigated before.\"Well, I also learned how to cook it.\" It was not him who liked braised elbows, it was Li Mingjin.Before the two of them were together because of the accident, Li Mingjin cooperated with him to eat light meals.One day after he was pregnant, Li Mingjin received several generals in the front hall. Luo Shuyu was always vomitted when he ate something because he was pregnant and was not in the mood, so he asked on a whim what the third prince ate today, and grandma Feng answered, there were several dishes to eat, one of which was braised pork elbows in brown sauce. Grandma Feng said at that time that the third prince's favorite waa this dish. At that time, Luo Shuyu knew that Li Mingjin\u2019s favorite was meat, and he always asked the kitchen to make vegetarian dishes, thinking that he would go back to the study after eating with him, wouldn't\u00a0 he steal meat behind his back, right?Li Mingjin tightened his lips, his Adam apple moved: \"Elbow, it's good, I also like it.\"His future imperial concubine was still a bit thinner. It was better to eat more meat, but he didn't expect, there was one more item that suited him. The criteria for getting a wife.Ansan caught Li Mingjin's eyes and went outside to call Xiaoer, and added braised elbows.While waiting for the dishes to come, Luo Shuyu handed Li Mingjin the drawing he had drawn: \"I asked you out today to show you this.\"Li Mingjin was still guessing if he gave himself a love letter. When he opened it, he was a little disappointed, but he was quickly attracted by the ingenious ideas inside. Luo Shuyu not only drew a picture of the remodeled keel waterwheel, he also added a detailed description of the text.Li Mingjin\u2019s expression was always very few, but he was still a little surprised: \"This is the keel waterwheel?\"Luo Shuyu said: \"It's the drawing after the keel waterwheel has reformed.\"Speaking of business affairs, Li Mingjin finally no longer focused on Luo Shuyu's face, he stared at the drawing and read it over and over again.He remembered that the Ministry of Industry where the eldest brother was, conducted a relatively confidential research recently, and he didn't know if it had anything to do with this person.His expression was dull and unclear, and when he looked at Luo Shuyu, he found that he was calm, without any guilty conscience or other emotions.The secret of Luo Shuyu's rebirth couldn't be told to anyone yet, but he didn't want to hide it from Li Mingjin, so he could only find a reasonable reason.\"Someone gave me the picture of the waterwheel modification, but I guarantee that the person is very credible. He told me that if the picture of the waterwheel is modified by the eldest prince, not only it will not benefit the people, but it will cause more tragedies. I asked what kind of tragedy, but he didn\u2019t tell me, but I believe him, the third prince, please believe me.\"\"That person told you about the waterwheel?\" He instinctively believed Luo Shuyu, but how could he know the news of the outside world if he didn't go out and the door was not open? He knew in advance about the poetry meeting and it was reasonable, but he had to think about the blueprint.Luo Shuyu nodded and said: \"That's right.\"Li Mingjin put away the drawing: \"Can anyone else see this drawing?\"Luo Shuyu said bluntly: \"My eldest brother, they also have a copy in their hands, but they haven't used it yet not because they are not using it. It was made, and that person told me about the drawing.\"Li Mingjin wondered: \"Why don't you help Luo Shumo and the others?\"Luo Shuyu paused and said frankly, \"You and me in the future. It is one body. I naturally prefer to believe in you. You know, my eldest brother\u2019s biological mother was my father\u2019s concubine back then. She got my mother's right after her death. Over the years, she not only invades my mother\u2019s dowry, but also tolerates people to deduct my expenses. I have endured the humiliation and survived to this day. It's impossible for me to have no grudge against them. Moreover, after my cousin came, their attitude towards me become worse. I was thinking if I can leave Luo soon, I\u2019ll wait for the marriage decree from the emperor. I\u2019m willing to give you the drawing, and the drawing is not stolen. Don\u2019t worry.\"\"I believe you.\" Li Mingjin no longer hesitated, \"I will handle the matter, don\u2019t worry. \"\"ah, the man said, don't give the credit to the eldest prince but my brother they can, otherwise the consequences can be disastrous. \"Luo Shu Yu said it again.When Li Mingjin saw his eyes glowing, he felt as if there were stars, so he looked very beautiful, and was almost fascinated: \"Okay.\"Speaking of this, they heard Xiaoer talking with the guard at the door, and they stopped mentioning the matter.The lunch was pretty good. Li Mingjin was very satisfied with Fumanlou's braised elbows. Luo Shuyu had light taste, so he gave it to Li Mingjin.Li Mingjin dressed up as Young Master Pianpian, rolled up his sleeves and licked the elbows, and he found it very funny. Luo Shuyu's smile never stopped.Because the embroiderers wanted to make his wedding gown, he had to go back to try the clothes in the afternoon, so he didn't stay in Fumanlou for too long.The two met secretly, so Li Mingjin couldn't take him back, so he was sent to the carriage and let people secretly protect him.Luo Shuyu looked at him again and exhorted: \"Then I'll go back, you should be more careful.\"\"Yeah.\" Li Mingjin didn't know what to say for a while, but wanted to say something, \"Write to me.\"Luo Shuyu nodded. \"Good.\"Li Mingjin said again: \"Write a little longer.\"Luo Shuyu gave him a faint smile: \"A few more words?\"Li Mingjin said solemnly, \" Forget it.\" Just write it.They really couldn't stay for long, and the two would separate. The next time they see each other was the day of their marriage, which was both anticipating and painful.Liming Jin stood in the doorway watching Luo Shu Yu's carriage left, turned around and asked Ansan: \"Are you sure he is the one who drew?\"Ansan: \"back to the master, this time Luo Gongzi never seen others, thr drawing he painted with his own hand, the words were written by himself, and he didn't fake the hands of others.\"Li Mingjin was deep in thought with a calm face.What they didn't know was that their appointment was seen by Shen Mingyun, who also went to Fumanlou for dinner.In the afternoon, after Luo Shuyu returned to Ruyiyuan, he was arrested and tried several wedding dresses and several new summer dresses. He was so tired that he didn't even have time to drink water, and he didn't want to take care of other things for the time being.In the evening, when the meal was about to be delivered, an unexpected visitor came to his Ruyiyuan.No one else, but Shen Mingyun.Luo Shuyu felt uncomfortable when he saw him, and there was no good expression on his slightly tired face.\"Why did my cousin look for me?\"At this moment, Shen Mingyun was willing to be more polite: \"Cousin Shu Yu, guess who I saw in Fumanlou today?\"Luo Shuyu was a little puzzled. Did Shen Mingyun see him met Li Mingjin? He asked calmly : \"Who?\"Shen Mingyun whispered: \"Of course it is your fiance, the third prince. Guess what else I saw?\"Luo Shuyu didn't bother with this way of speaking: \"Cousin might as well say it all at once. I haven't eat yet.\"Shen Mingyun's entire face was full of gossip and gloat: \"Then I told you clearly, your fiance was dating someone at Fumanlou for lunch today .\"Luo Shuyu, who had an empty belly, couldn't say anything. Looking at Shen Mingyun: \"...\" Are you blind?The author has something to say:The third prince: Wife, look at me and see me, I am fluttering in white, handsome, white horse comes as a standard, have you fallen in love?Luo Shuyu: ...I don't really want to fall in love.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 Pre-Marriage CourseWho else but Luo Shuyu could have a date with Li Mingjin for lunch? Shen Mingyun didn't even think about asking about Luo Shuyu's whereabouts. If he was a little bit more careful, he wouldn't run to him and made this stupid little report.Shen Mingyun's act of instigating separation was too obvious. Luo Shuyu didn't even know his thoughts were difficult, not to mention that he also knew that he still had a system hidden in his mind.He was very sure that there was no part of Shen Mingyun instigating his marriage with Li Mingjin in the book. Even the marriage was something Shen Mingyun wanted to get rid of. Was he really so kind to help him escape the marriage? According to him, not necessarily, Shen Mingyun had no sympathy for these \"ancient people\", and only treated them as NPCs who earned commercial coins.Was it because of his rebirth that the system could detect his existence and prepared to issue a task for Shen Mingyun to obliterate his existence?If this was the case, then he had to deal with Shen Mingyun, who had the system, and dealing with the system was the ultimate goal.The sudden change made Luo Shuyu's vigilance stronger again. Before that, he hadn't considered that the system could detect whether he was reborn.In the book, Shen Mingyun did the tasks under the guidance of the system. He was bound to the system, including the tasks that were mandatory, without any initiative. It was just that he had a natural tendency towards the system, never disgusted, but complacent. From the perspective of reading books, he didn\u2019t think the system was so terrible, but now, if the system really detected that Luo Shuyu was reborn, which was inconsistent with the purpose of the task it released, it was possible that his existence would affect Shen Mingyun, then the system issued to Shen Mingyun the task to deal with him, and the system had become Luo Shuyu's ultimate target to deal with. As for Shen Mingyun, was it just a tool that it depended on? Based on this reasoning, Luo Shuyu felt that it was reasonable, but what was the purpose of the system attached to Shen Mingyun's mind?In short, if Luo Shuyu wanted to live a good life in peace and stability, not only Shen Mingyun had to disappear, but also the system in his mind would also disappear. He had to deal with not only people but also things that didn't know whether they were gods or weird thing, which was suddenly increased the difficulty.Despite this, he was not afraid of anything, at least Shen Mingyun's actions were predictable, as long as he controled his movements.He read the whole text, and didn't find that the system had occupied Shen Mingyun's body, thinking that it couldn't control the body.In Luo Shuyu's place, he had an additional piece of information that needed to be recorded and an invisible enemy that needed to be dealt with.At this time, Shen Mingyun didn't get the response he deserved. He asked Luo Shuyu: \"You don't worry about your future?\" He couldn't help but despise the ancients for compromising his own destiny. If Luo Shuyu admitted his fate, he could only start with the third prince.After a round of well-founded speculation, Luo Shuyu already knew Shen Mingyun\u2019s purpose. He followed Shen Mingyun\u2019s thoughts and said: \"I will be married to him soon. In the future, I will be the wife of the third prince. The third prince can take concubines. The confidante outside can talk about the wine, and I can\u2019t control it. My marriage contract was given by the Holy Spirit. How can I change it, even if you tell me that he stays in the brothel day and night?\u201dShen Mingyun finished listening to Luo Shuyu\u2019s words. There was more sympathy for him on his face, thinking that it was indeed a bit miserable, Luo Shuyu couldn't change his own destiny, but he would help him solve it!He thought he had a good word to persuade him: \"Don't you want to change it? Marry such a carefree man, you will be ruined in the second half of your life!\"He said that he wouldn't give up anything for 200 mall coins, and Shen Mingyun began to give Luo Shuyu an idea. Decided to pour more chicken soup for Luo Shuyu, an ancient person: \"I feel it's really worthless for you. You are the son of Shang Shufu. You need to look good and have a reputation. Why stick to a decree? I think you should think more about yourself, or let the third prince destroy the marriage.\"\"Let him destroy the marriage?\" Luo Shuyu sneered in his heart. Did this Shen Mingyun really knew what he was talking about? He really didn\u2019t listen to what he had said about punishing the nine races before, so that he couldn't escape the marriage and went another way. After treating him as a task, he would do everything to do the task, and he would be a fool full of shit?It was true that if Shen Mingyun said this to a person who had no opinion, he should be able to see results, but he didn't know how terribly Luo Shuyu was harmed by him in his previous life. When he thought of his previous life, Luo Shuyu's good mood for a day was dispelled by him. After calming down, he made a plan.Shen Mingyun wanted to sabotage his wedding with Li Mingjin. It was better to block it. The more he refused him, the more he would find a way. At least he could see things under his nose, and fight him again and again. He really didn\u2019t know that Shen Mingyun still had it. How many things happened, his props were not only effective for him, but also useful for others to use.\"Yes, let him ruin the marriage.\" Shen Mingyun felt that his chicken soup was quite effective, and he noticed that Luo Shuyu's attitude was slowly changing, and he could continue his efforts. \"This kind of thing had become a game between the third prince and the emperor. It had nothing to do with you. In the future, you could live a more carefree life and marry someone who didn\u2019t have that troublesome trouble at home, it's very good.\"\"Really?\" He really felt that Shen Mingyun was terribly innocent now, the ger who was retired by the royal family could still be married well? He really didn't have the slightest common sense, and he used all means to achieve his goal. He pretended to be relaxed and hesitated, \"Do you really want to help me?\"\"Of course, I am your cousin\". Try to make himself looked genuine.But Luo Shuyu only thought he was a bit funny, and even somehow, this Shen Mingyun still had a distinctive feature of his cousin Shen's skin, but now he felt that it was not so dazzling.Shen Mingyun was talking about this with Luo Shuyu and didn't shy away from other people. Qingwang and Grandma Feng stood not far away and listened to their conversation without missing a word. Luo Shuyu didn't mean to stop it, he deliberately .Grandma Feng was Li Mingjin\u2019s people from the start to finish, but Luo Shuyu didn\u2019t mind her passing the conversation between Shen Mingyun and him to Li Mingjin\u2019s ears.After getting a satisfactory answer, Shen Mingyun left Ruyiyuan and went back to think about how to make the third prince refused the marriage contract with Luo Shuyu.Luo Shuyu watched the overjoyed Shen Mingyun left, frowning slightly, Shen Mingyun would definitely start from Li Mingjin's side, he must take precautions, but how could he guard against his system props?At the same time, Luo Renshou went directly to Fu Rongju to meet the old lady after returning from the job. Seeing that Luo Shuyu would be married in one month, the royal side was intensively preparing for the wedding of the third prince, and they couldn't lag behind. After the court, Emperor Tiansheng also specifically asked him about the preparations for the marriage of the two childrens. He felt that he was sloppy, and Emperor Tiansheng didn't look like he was indifferent to the third prince.Nowadays, it was impossible for Liu Shi to act on Luo Shuyu. Even if Liu Shi was willing to do it, Luo Shuyu couldn\u2019t agree with his current stiff state. He even called Liu Shi auntie Liu. It was impossible for Luo Renshou not to hear this. The dowry matter really angered him.The old lady hadn't learned from other, she fasted and recited Buddha recently, and was enjoying the little girl's leg pressing. Hearing Luo Renshou's request for her to come forward to host Luo Shuyu's wedding, she frowned and said, \"Why do you still let my old arms and legs handle this, Liu Shi?\"\"You don't know, Shu Yu knows she has misappropriated Chen's dowry, a few days ago, there was a commotion, and Liu Shi was so scared on the spot and Shu Yu doesn\u2019t want to see her. I thought then I have this thoughts. After all, I'm the one who is sorry for him first. Mother, you just need to show up. After all, we are married to the royal family, and we can do it better, lest outsiders say that the son doesn\u2019t like the marriage given by the sage.\u201dThe old lady agreed after weighing it for a while. She wasn't always confused. In the final analysis, this was not a marriage of an ordinary official and eunuch. She had to worry about her son's official career. Nothing was more important than her son's career.Luo Renshou stopped by the old lady for dinner and drank some mung bean soup before returning to the yard after the heat dropped. When he passed by Liu Shi's yard, he thought that he hadn't seen Liu Shi for many days, so he went to see her. As soon as he walked in the door, he heard her scolded the maid out of anger. After seeing him, Liu Shi cried so much that it was raining.Luo Renshou was bothering her about messing up Chen's dowry. At this moment, he heard her crying and said a few words, and then the two quarreled. When he got up, Liu Shi's younger brother was mentioned in the fierce verbal quarrel. The more they quarreled, the more upset they became. Luo Renshou didn't sit for a while and raised his foot and left, turning around to go to his concubine who had just been in for more than a year.All this was known to Luo Shuyu in the next morning.The master went to the wife\u2019s yard and had a fight. As long as you inquired about it, you knew it. What's more, Luo Shuyu had been paying close attention to the movements of Luo Renshou and Shen Mingyun recently. Anything big and small in the house would soon be introduced to his ear.Luo Renshou and Liu Shi's renunciation, this was a good thing, the house was restless, Luo Renshou had any thoughts to care about the Third Prince's Mansion in the future.Qingwang had gained experience in homecoming from Grandma Feng. He became more sophisticated in inquiring about news, and chatting with people was a set. Of course, the money was not less expensive. The money Luo Renshou had recently given to him was spent on buying news. The money was originally used to spend, and it was useless to have money if he was dead.After breakfast, Mingyue, the maid next to the old lady, came to pass a message, saying that it was the old lady who had invited him.Luo Shuyu asked her, \"I don't know what the old lady told me to do?\"Mingyue was willing to tell him: \"Third young master, it's a good thing. Yesterday, the master came to ask the old lady to come forward and take care of your marriage. She ask you to go over and say something about yourself.\"\"Oh, okay, thank you .\"\"Young master is polite.\"Luo Shuyu understood as soon as he heard that the dowry matter was still being processed, and some items sent out by Liu Shi were afraid that he would not be able to find them. It was impossible for Luo Renshou to fill him with all the silver. It must be hoped that the old lady would come forward to do the marriage, so that Luo Shuyu would go out more decently, and he would have more face. Luo Renshou was the one who sold him well. No, it should be made up the deficient in dowry.Luo Renshou understood more than anyone thought.Luo Shuyu took the useful Grandma Feng and Qingwang to the old lady's Fu Rongju.The old lady's yard was not as lively as usual. When he came here, it was either Liu Shi's and the concubines flattered or the juniors were trying to please the old lady, or he was listening to Shen Mingyun talking nonsense with the old lady. Shen Mingyun was not the same as others. He probably had a good relationship with the old lady. The book said that the old lady reminded him of his grandmother who lived in the country and was very patriarchal.It was very quiet today, Luo Shuyao and others were not there, and Shen Mingyun didn't come. The old lady saw him alone.It turned out that changing a way of living could be more respected. Luo Shuyu couldn't help feeling sad for his own life in the past. It was impossible to protect himself by not causing troubles. As long as he was in the game, he would be the middleman. Those who played chess didn't regret the move.The old lady was not close to Luo Shuyu, but it was the grandmother and grandchildren, and there was no holiday.She asked Luo Shuyu to come over to mention some things about the marriage. She didn't say much about it, and she also took the initiative to ask him if he needed anything.He also invited him a married ger in his thirties who was a pre-marriage teacher. He was specially invited to teach Luo Shuyu how to deal with house affairs after marriage, and learned how to get along with husband and wife.In the previous life, the wedding was hosted by Liu Shi. There was no such process. Luo Shuyu only found out after exploring it in the Third Prince's Mansion. Looking back now, Li Mingjin had never embarrassed him in this regard.However, when it came to how husband and wife get along, even if he had been married once with Li Mingjin, he still had a bit of a hot face.He and Li Mingjin came too suddenly at that time, and later became pregnant directly. After more than a year, there was an accident at home and they hadn't yet enjoyed a real married life together. In that respect, there was only one time, which was not an experience.The gers of Daxia Kingdom were different from women, and some of their physical structures were different. Many noble gers had no experience in this area before getting married. Naturally, there would be special teachers to guide them, to take some courses to let them roughly understanding this process and wouldn't make a joke in the night of the bridal chamber.In the past few days, Luo Shuyu had spent the past few days listening to the class. He had learned a lot of how to deal with house affairs, heard the blushing knowledge of husband and wife's life, and saw some erotic pictures.That night, Ansan reported Luo Shuyu's itinerary for the past two days to Li Mingjin.Li Mingjin: \"Class? What class.\"Ansan: \"The subordinates didn't dare to listen.\"Li Mingjin raised his cold eyes: \"Is it discovered?\"Ansan: \"Master, it's a course for the ger before getting married. It's inconvenient for this subordinate to listen.\" Afraid of being whip by you!Li Mingjin was clear and waved to let him went out.After Ansan went out, he dragged out a box in the corner and turned out a stack of books, all of which were named \"Men's Essential Secrets: The Young Master\".Since the imperial concubine took the pre-marriage lesson so seriously, he couldn't fall behind!The next day, Li Mingjin faced everyone with his black eyes, and the courtiers saw the third prince standing aside with his eyes gloomy, feeling deeply that their hair was horrified, and couldn't help shivering.Today's third prince was terrible!In fact, he only studied the secrets necessary for marriage.The author has something to say:The Third Prince: wife, believe me, I'm for our love!Luo Shuyu: ...Go away!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 Master, You're FinishedIn the matter of Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin getting married, Shen Mingyun, who was more anxious than the two protagonists, was also given a task by the system.Seeing the days of August 10 getting closer and closer, he was also anxious in his heart.he had also taken on tasks that were difficult to complete before, and there were time constraints, but they were not too difficult. He was either going to come up with some ideas for this, or to solve some trivial things. But now, if you wanted to find ways to prevent a marriage, it was better to ruin it. He had no experience in doing such things without breaking down a bridge.\u00a0And two days had passed since he talked to Luo Shuyu, and Luo Shuyu hadn't given him a clear answer yet.Luo Shuyu was still greedy for pleasure when he wanted to come here. It was estimated that he didn't intend to cooperate with him at all, but waited to marry the third prince and lived the life of the imperial concubine.Shen Mingyun wondered how to get the third prince to divorce in his leisurely little building.Letting Luo Shuyu escaped from marriage or death wouldn't work. How could we get the third prince to divorce and ensured that Luo Shuyu's reputation wouldn't be corrupted. Anyway, the third prince Li Mingjin had a bad reputation.Shen Mingyun didn't put all his expectations on Luo Shuyu, he still had to start with the third prince.But what to do?\u00a0He asked the system, but the system didn't give him advice, only reminding him that he could buy props with the mall coins.correct!\u00a0Props!If the third prince had an accident that prevented the wedding from being held as scheduled, wouldn't it be the best of both worlds? The system task only said to prevent their wedding on August 10, and didn't say not to let them get married. Hahaha, as long as the task was completed. The Chinese writing was really broad and profound. As long as it wasbcarefully studied, there were still loopholes. He had taken advantage of this loophole.However, the ancients paid more attention to good times. The third prince could still get married if he was injured, so he must disappear on the wedding day?Next, first wrote a detailed plan, and then chose to use the props accordingly to cause an accident, so that he temporarily disappeared without compensation.That's all right, he had a plan.It was a pity, who exactly leaked Li Bai's poems?\u00a0He hadn't found it yet. Didn't the system say that there was no Li Bai in this world?\u00a0Was there any other traverser?\u00a0But the system said no again, which was really a headache. Would he still dare to go to the poetry club in the future?Luo Shuyu had been in class for a few days, absorbed some things that his husband loved, and then thought of Li Mingjin in his previous life.He thought a lot last night and slept a bit late, but at least he didn\u2019t have a nightmare, but got up late. He was now preparing for the wedding, and the old lady didn\u2019t need him to ask for peace. Liu Shi just fell out with him, and he didn\u2019t want her to go.He and Li Mingjin didn't communicate with each other every day, too frequent was not good, and it was easy to reveal that they had met in advance.The most lively part of the capital recently was the widely spread \"Li Bai Poems\". Shen Mingyun didn't pay attention to this matter, but he was a little flustered. It was estimated that he wouldn't plagiarize the poems of his predecessors in the near future. It was easy to lose a good impression if you did a lot of things like filling yourself with swollen faces and fat people.After coming back, Luo Shuyu no longer did the same thing every day, he still had a lot of things to be busy now.In the morning, he wanted to listen to Grandma Feng talk about how to manage the prince\u2019s mansion. Luo Shuyu in the previous life was actually very relaxed. There was no one else in the house. Li Mingjin had no concubines, not even a room (maybe a room for a woman who had relationship with LMJ but not counted as concubine, as lover), and he was the only one in the entire backyard comfortably, the only thing he struggled with was when Li Mingjin's whip would fall on his head.\u00a0In fact, when Li Mingjin was with him, he rarely showed the whip on his face.Qingwang, the temporary spy, came back to report the new situation after he had eaten breakfast.Qingwang: \"Young master, the people in Shen Mingyun's yard told me a new situation. He mysteriously walked out the back door this morning.\"Luo Shuyu: \"What is he going out for?\"Qingwang: \"I don't know yet, he just meet a close friend, he didn\u2019t bring someone else, I sent someone to follow.\"Luo Shuyu:\u00a0\"\u00a0Okay, don\u2019t follow too closely, he may meet some big people, don\u2019t be caught.\"Qingwang: \"But our people are not enough to follow a professional.\"Luo Shuyu: \"I'll find a way.\"At this time, only Li Mingjin he could think of, and only Li Mingjin he could believe. It was time to ask him something.If Shen Mingyun went to see the eldest prince or the fourth prince and others, according to Shen Mingyun's description of the two, there were masters around them, very cautious, especially the fourth prince.The biological mother of the fourth prince was originally the maid brought into the palace by the eldest prince's mother concubine from her house. One day the emperor drank some wine and put her to sleep when she looked good, and then the fourth prince was born.\u00a0Although he had a position, it wasn't high, and he was hated by the mother concubine of the eldest prince.\u00a0His biological mother didn't have a strong background. The fourth prince was bullied by other princes since he was a child. After he grew up, the closest prince was the crown prince. In order to be protected, he had been very forbearing. Don\u2019t look at his daily laughs and elegant, but his mind was very deep. People couldn't figure it out.\u00a0However, his appearance was as gentle as jade, he was more like a spring breeze towards Shen Mingyun, and he had a good impression of Shen Mingyun.Shen Mingyun, who came to this world, liked the fourth prince who had gentle attitude. The two had experienced many things in the book, and they naturally came together. Another point was the fourth prince's appearance was only slightly worse than Li Mingjin , and his \"warm temperament\" was Shen Mingyun's dishes.Considering that Shen Mingyun's whereabouts were related to the future of his family, Luo Shuyu decisively wrote a letter to Li Mingjin, this time he wrote a little longer.At noon, Luo Shuyu's asked Grandma Feng to send the letter to the Third Prince's Mansion.The two had a marriage contract, and a bit of correspondence was justified.Li Mingjin went back to the house to sleep for a while after going to court in the morning. When he woke up, he received a letter from Luo Shuyu. He opened the letter before lunch.He immediately agreed after reading the content about the important person at the front, but his expression remained unmoved. The corner of his mouth rose slightly at the last sentence. It was rare that his face that usually without a smiling face was a little hot, and his imperial concubine was not too bad. Be reserved, said this before getting married.\u00a0But, they were going to get married soon, so it was okay to talk in advance.Always scratching his heart like a feather, itching to see Luo Shuyu.\u3010Recently, I listened to my master's lecture and I was better than reading for ten years.\u00a0Luo Shuyu.\u00a0\u3011Li Mingjin, whose heart had already drifted towards Luo Mansion, went to the study to reply to Luo Shuyu's letter after lunch.The imperial concubine learned so seriously, what else was he dissatisfied with.Since they met, the frequency of writing letters between the two had increased, and there would be one in at least two days. This had became Li Mingjin's most anticipated thing recently.Li Mingjin was assigned to the Criminal Ministry and followed the Criminal Ministry's officers to study the law and settle cases, but he was always inattentive. He went to sleep as soon as he got there, or went to watch the prison guards to interrogate the prisoners.How could a prince take a pleasure in watching people whipped every day, and when he was upset, he would do it himself. His cruelty was really cruel. No wonder the saint threw him to the criminal ministry and replaced him with another department. The officers who may instruct him were all pumped by him. Went home and lay down to recover.Today, the third prince came to make appearance and left. The atmosphere in the Criminal Department suddenly became much more relaxed. The two Criminal Department officers, who usually disliked each other, reached an agreement on this matter. They truced first and relaxed for a while.However, in the afternoon, the two officers of the Criminal Department saw Li Mingjin, who was still full of emotions, returned to the Criminal Department. He said that he could take a small shift today, and signaled that the officers of the Criminal Department would send him some work to pass the time.The two criminal officers covered their chests and took a deep breath, let's take in the air for a while!Luo Shuyu didn't know how Li Mingjin tortured the officers mentally. He was waiting for the news from the next person.He thought that Shen Mingyun would wait for two days before coming back to him for a few words, but he didn't expect to be so impatient, and he didn't know what bad idea he was going to make.Most of the time, Shen Mingyun was an extremely selfish person, suddenly being good to others was purposeful.In the evening, Li Mingjin's letter and the news from the people who followed Shen Mingyun arrived in front of Luo Shuyu at the same time.Luo Shuyu first opened the letter from\u00a0 Li Mingjin, one of which contained only eight characters.[So good, study hard.\u00a0\u3011Study?\u00a0Luo Shuyu couldn't help but his face was slightly hot. Li Mingjin didn't know anything, right?No, he must know, Luo family not only had Grandma Feng, but also other eyeliners, including his actions, he knew, but Luo Shuyu only felt at ease.In the letter there was a waist card, he said he would send two guards over at night. If there was a dangerous thing to do, he must first inform him.This letter was written in a relatively serious manner, Luo Shuyu's heart was warm, Li Mingjin trusted him, nothing was more important than getting his trust.It was just that he didn't quite understand, why would Li Mingjin trust him?\u00a0He hadn't figured this out till now.\u00a0This problem didn't affect him, especially about the person Li Mingjin sent to stare at Shen Mingyun. Sooner or later he would let Li Mingjin knew about it, and told him in advance now that the power of one person was far less powerful than the combination of two people.The news Qingwang received didn't disappoint Luo Shuyu.Shen Mingyun's whereabouts all day long.Qingwang said: \"Our people said that he first went to his store in the morning to buy new products, training the employees in his store, and shouting slogans, which attracted the attention of many passers-by. It was sold out. At noon, he met a man in a restaurant, young master, who do you guess this young master Shen met?\"\"s\u0101n ji\u00e0o ji\u01d4 li\u00fa?\" Luo Shuyu drank a sip of tea. He remembered that Shen Mingyun was mentioned in the book. He was very longing for the ancient brothel, and he had known many brothel top brands because of the rouge gouache in these years. It was a sales idea to find them as the image spokesperson in the store. After all, he could only invite brothel women. The men he hooked up didn't wipe these gouaches and couldn't endorse him, let alone she was Su Zhixian, the number one beauty in Beijing.(s\u0101n ji\u00e0o ji\u01d4 li\u00fa=the Three Religions (Daoism, Confucianism, Buddhism) and Nine Schools (Confucians, Daoists, Yin-Yang, Legalists, Logicians, Mohists, Political Strategists, Eclectics, Agriculturists) fig. people from all trades (often derog.)Qingwang: \"Almost, it's the top brand of Huancai Pavilion, Liang Xian'er!\"Luo Shuyu: \"Our people still know Liang Xian'er? Doesn't she rarely show up? Seeing her is a big deal.\"Qing Wang: \"I don't know. But the maid next to Liang Xian'er is a famous tiger, ugly and strong. She has a good hand in fighting. As long as there is Liang Xian'er, she must be there, and she hardly leaves Liang Xian'er. It must be her.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Do you know what they talked about?\"Qingwang: \"They entered the private room, but\u00a0I\u00a0didn't listen.\"\"I see, you send someone to keep staring at Youyou Xiaozhu.\" Youyou Xiaozhu is the name of Shen Mingyun's yard, he consciously felt poetic.(youyou=lasting for ages, preposterous. Xiaozhu=small building)Luo Shuyu pondered this Liang Xian'er, whose name was quite familiar.There were three famous brothels in the capital, Huancai Pavilion, Yunliang Pavilion, and Qingyuan Pavilion. This was not known from the book, but he knew it in his previous life.Why did you remember it so clearly, because every time Li Mingjin went out to drink with people, these were the ones he went to.\u00a0When he entertained the guests, he liked to go to Huancai Pavilion the most.He didn't care so much in his previous life, but he couldn't listen to it in this life!Ansan was sent by Li Mingjin to work next to Luo Shuyu. At a certain point, he was respectfully introduced to the door by Grandma Feng.On the first day of taking office, he saw Young Master Luo coldly asking him: \"I ask you, does the third prince go to Huancai Pavilion to listen to Liang Xianer's music from time to time?\"Ansan: \"...\" Oh, I'm going, It's so hard. Shall I say yes or not?\u00a0One thing is certain, Master, you are finished!The author has something to say:Third Prince: wife, listen to me!\u00a0I never listen to small songs, I only listen to buckle music!\u00a0Such as Legend of Phoenix!\u00a0~~\u00a0I am like a fish in your lotus pond~~Waiting for\u00a0you to be in the middle of the water~~~(fish in your lotus pond means it's already yours XD)Luo Shuyu:\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 \"Hua Kui 101\"After Li Mingjin, who didn't know anything, received the report from Ansan, he instantly felt a bolt from the blue, and disaster fell from the sky!How did his future imperial concubine know that he would go to Huancai Pavilion to listen to music on weekdays?.At this moment, he was sitting gloomily in the study and was about to write a letter to explain to Luo Shuyu.He hadn't written yet, he thought again, he didn't do anything wrong, so why should he be in a hurry to explain?.Wasn't explaining the same as covering up?After thinking for a while, Luo Shuyu usually stayed at home, why did he pay attention to places like Huancai Pavilion, and what did he want to do? First, he asked him to ask for someone, and now it was Liang Xian'er of the Huancai Pavilion.He thought it was Luo Shuyu who first asked him to ask for someone just to find out about his mother, but this was not the case. His concubine knew more than he thought, and he was a talent.He sent An San and An Jiu over, An Jiu was on duty at Luo Shuyu's side, and An San came back to report the situation.Li Mingjin stopped the pen in his hand: \"Why did he ask about the Huancai Pavilion? Even he heard about Liang Xian'er plays the song.\"An San: \"This subordinate doesn't know, Luo Gongzi mainly wants us to keep an eye on Shen Mingyun in secret.\"(back to gongzi=the son of official or noble, sorry, my first time translating )Li Mingjin: \"Shen Mingyun?\"An San explained: \"It's Shen Mingyun who came from the north to join the Luo family last year. Luo Gongzi's cousin is the Gongzi who copied Li Bai's \"Near the Wine\", and now lives in the Luo family. Before you had a few encounters with him.\"\"It's him.\" Li Mingjin suddenly realized that there was such a person, but he didn't pay much attention to it, he just regarded him as an unnecessary passerby.\"Master, do you still remember the rumors that you had a relationship with Shen Gongzi a few days ago? Maybe Luo Gongzi cares.\" An San always positioned himself as a caring little jacket who could help the master. The confidant who could give the direction.Li Mingjin tapped the table with his fingertips. If Luo Shuyu made people stare at Shen Mingyun because of jealousy, he instantly felt that this reason was very valid.His heart beat a little faster, it turned out that he cared about himself so much.Li Mingjin: \"Then let's follow the his thoughts, and let you stare at whoever he wants. Also, find someone to correct the rumors. At that time, who spread it out?\"An San: \"When Shen Mingyun opened the store, he was suppressed by the store opposite and borrowed your name, but you didn't care at that time.\"Li Mingjin: \"I remember this Shen Mingyun sees me like a mouse sees a cat? Since he is afraid of me, he is bold enough. He dares to do things under my name. Do things neatly!.\"Dark Three: \"Subordinate will let everyone know that you have nothing to do with him, Master.\"Li Mingjin stroked the nearest section, Luo Shuyu, he told him first was the plagiarism of Li Bai's poetry collection, and the other was the drawings. These two things had the shadow of this Shen Mingyun. What was wrong with this person?He still had an impression of this person, he was very nosy, he (LMJ) seemed to be able to see him everywhere, except for the crown prince, the eldest brother and the fourth brother seemed to have a good impression of him, but he really didn't care about this person.When he first went to Luo Mansion a few days ago, the eldest brother and the fourth brother said something nice about him, and explained for him about plagiarizing other people's poems. They all said that this person was simple, straightforward and innocent, a rare temperament. He must have been deceived to do such a thing.In the past, Li Mingjin seldom paid attention to the situation of the Luo family. The only person he paid attention to was Luo Shuyu. Did this Shen Mingyun occupy the mind of his imperial concubine too much? What did he do to his docile imperial concubine?He once again pulled out the waterwheel blueprint that Luo Shuyu gave him, and stared at it for a while. Even he, who didn't understand craftsmen, felt that the drawing was detailed and novel, and it would definitely benefit the people after it was made.According to Luo Shuyu's meaning, if the eldest brother made it, it would cause many problems later, and it could only be made by others in advance. But who was the opposite of eldest Brother?. Today's court game was divided into two factions, one was the crown prince, and the other was the first prince.As the crown prince and the eldest prince grew older and their experience increased, the battle between the two was extremely fierce and intensified. If the credit for this drawing was transferred to the crown prince, the problem seemed to be able to be solved easily. As for the follow-up, he could send people to watch. For now, the things that benefitted the common people were what the crown prince neede the most now. He needed popular reputation to consolidate his status. The most important thing was that the crown prince had no intersection with Shen Mingyun, which was in line with Luo Shuyu's requirement.The court also had the situation of the court, and there were also competitions in the palace. Father's body still looked tough, but when he was older, his body wasn't as tough as before. The struggle between the eldest prince and the crown prince was becoming more and more fierce. It was for the sake of the future, this was not only the competition between the two, but also the competition of snobbery of the major families behind them.The crown prince was descended from the queen, he was directly descended, and his bloodline was orthodox. Needless to say, he had the support of the prime minister's family. The prime minister was highly respected, and the family system was complicated and innumerable, like a big banyan tree with intertwined roots.The power behind the eldest prince was also not low. His mother concubine, Lin Guifei had always been very favored by the emperor in the harem. Before Tiansheng ascended the throne, Lin Guifei had been with him all the time. They were a young couple, and she was still very favored until now. The limelight was unparalleled, and the shelf in the palace was bigger than that of the queen. Although his mother's family was not as good as the prime minister's mansion, it was also a family that had stood for a hundred years.The battle between the two factions was no longer a day or two, and the struggle wouldn't stop because of one or two words from the emperor. Don't look at the crown prince's current glory, but who would ascend to the throne in the years after Emperor Tiansheng, he (Emperor) was the one who would allow to say. Likewise, under such power, it was almost impossible for other princes to make a difference.Li Mingjin never stole the limelight with them. Only he knew how he acted, and it didn't matter how bad he was. It was just that the trouble now was that Shen Mingyun, who his imperial concubine was staring at, had something to do with the eldest prince. The advantage was that the trouble could be solved slowly. Li Mingjin thought about it, and finally thought of a person, he could hand over the drawings to the other party, it should be safe. Wouldn't it be more fun to muddy the water a bit?Luo Shuyu didn't know how Li Mingjin dealt with the drawings, and he didn't mention it in his reply, but he believed that Li Mingjin was not a scumbag. He had lived in the court where power struggled since he was a child. If he wanted to do something, he shouldn't be bothered. On the contrary, it might be even more powerful than what he knew. Otherwise, how could he have escaped from the heavily guarded prison to save him and the child, only to be betrayed later.He hadn't seen anything about Shen Mingyun's mission against him and Li Mingjin in the book, and it was unclear what exactly Shen Mingyun did to Liang Xian'er.The only thing he knew was that Liang Xian'er and Li Mingjin knew each other. Could it be that Shen Mingyun wanted to ask Li Mingjin out through Liang Xian'er and then did something to him? The bad thing was that Luo Shuyu had no way of knowing whether Shen Mingyun would use the props he bought from the system mall, or what kind of props he would use, and how could he avoid getting caught?He thought about what props Shen Mingyun had at this time, and what he would do with the props.He always needed to have physical contact when using the props, and his props were limited and couldn't be transferred to others, only by himself. If it was a prop such as a recipe, the object made with the materials of this world could be given to others, and this was not a big restriction.Luo Shuyu continued to reminisce about Shen Mingyun's handling of such incidents in the book. What would he do if he wanted to make someone disappeared alone?One was the most direct way with making the other party unconscious and making an incident as a \"kidnapping incident\", and the next was to invite some s\u0101n ji\u00e0o ji\u01d4 li\u00fa people, pretended to save people and then gave the other party the props.Seeing that the wedding date was getting closer and closer, Luo Shuyu's expectations for the future were also increasing, and the contents of the book were played over again and again in his mind.A few days passed since Li Mingjin gave Ansan and Anjiu to Luo Shuyu.The wedding dress was still being sewn, and it had not yet been completed. He heard that the embroiderers were rushing to work non-stop. The wedding of the third prince was a major event for the royal family.In the past few days, Luo Shuyu had received the money that Luo Renshou asked to move into his yard. Liu Shi took out Chen's dowry and all those who could come back came back. Those who couldn't come back were converted into money and shops. How to suffer, Luo Shuyu wouldn't ask Liu Shi, he only looked for Luo Renshou, who could call the shots, and the trouble was over. Luo Renshou was a little afraid of him now, so it would be better to give the money.The old lady talked about Luo Shuyu's marriage and tried her best not to make any mistakes. She might be a little confused in small matters, but she was able to handle major matters clearly. She originally wanted to ask Shen Mingyun to come and help, but considering the shameful troubles before, she didn't let Shen Mingyun intervene, the current Luo Shuyu was not easy to fool.Everything was still under the control, so Luo Shuyu stayed in the yard with peace of mind and packed his luggage.He was going to take everything he could and put it into his suitcase.In his last life, he threw away everything he didn't want, but now it was all his memories of growing up, so he decided to put it all away.After being exhausted for a long time, just after the maids were tidy up, they saw Qingwang running into the yard with excitement on his face.Grandma Feng didn't say anything about him, Luo Shuyu was the one who made the decision here, and she wouldn't go beyond the norm.Qingwang held a piece of paper in his hand and ran into the room excitedly: \"Gongzi, I got the news!\"Luo Shuyu turned his wrist to relax: \"What news?\"Qingwang handed the piece of paper in his hand to him: \"Gongzi, look.\"Luo Shuyu took the paper and saw that it was written in bold letters: \"Hua Kui 101?\"(Hua Kui = nickname for a famous beauty or courtesan)Qing Wang nodded vigorously: \"Yes, this was something Shen Gongzi had been tinkering with recently, I heard They said that Shen Gongzi was going to cooperate with several big brothels such as Huancai to hold the 'Hua Kui 101' competition! This was the advertising paper for the Hua Kui competition. Before it started, many people outside were chatting like a raging fire, just waiting to look at this 'Hua Kui 101'. I inquired about the rules, they will select 101 people from several brothels to participate, perform in the form of a group, and the spectators below will vote for the ranking. In the end, there will be ten who debut alone, several major brothels will have their special events in the future.\"Luo Shuyu had heard about this Hua Kui activity, and it came out around this time, so he almost forgot.He still remembered that Luo Renshou quietly asked his servants to vote for his favorite \"Hua Kui\".\"Hua Kui 101\" not only had the slogan \"If you love her, vote for her\", but also had a very blatant theme song \"Choose me, choose me, I am the most beautiful\".This show was not original by Shen Mingyun, and it was copied from variety shows he watched based on his original world.The \"Hua Kui 101\" program was novel in this era. Shen Mingyun made a lot of money in it, but at the same time, it also brought many disadvantages. Because of this show, how many people had thrown a lot of money in to vote for their favorite \"Hua Kui\", and some had borrowed usury through underground banks, causing their families to be ruined.In the last life, Shen Mingyun held \"Hua Kui 101\", which didn't affect his and Li Mingjin's wedding. Was that something to cover up with this show?He remembered that it was mentioned in the book that in the era of Shen Mingyun, brothel was an industry expressly prohibited by the state, calling prostitution and whoring, and there was a special department in the police station.Since Shen Mingyun wanted to move \"Hua Kui 101\", it was not impossible for him to introduce him to \"sweeping pornography and illegal activities\".That night, Li Mingjin was troubled by the new words that appeared in Luo Shuyu's letter.Li Mingjin asked Ansan: \"What is the meaning of 'sweeping pornography and illegals activities'?\"Ansan explained intimately: \"Master, Master Luo said, the brothel has to take the truth according to the law.\"Li Mingjin pursed his lips: \"...\"Imperial Concubine, this jealousy was really unprecedented!The author has something to say:The Third Prince: Wifd, choose me, I am C! (C = center position)Luo Shuyu:\u00a0 \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The two secret guards sent by Li Mingjin were also relatively professional. The surveillance content sent back to Luo Shuyu was all detailed, and it was almost impossible to put Shen Mingyun's mind. The system was uncovered.With the presence of professionals, Luo Shuyu's heart fell back to the truth. Li Mingjin was framed in his last life not because he was incompetent, but because he didn't have a system that could issue tasks and props, and props were very important to Shen Mingyun's growth in this world.According to Shen Mingyun's usual style, every time he wanted to hold an event, he would publicize it for a while, mainly by distributing flyers, posting advertisements in major stores, and telling words from mouth. Obviously, otherwise Shen Mingyun wouldn't have accumulated a huge amount of wealth so quickly after he arrived in this world. The money he earned was later used to recruit troops to buy horses for the fourth prince.Did Shen Mingyun take out \"Hua Kui 101\" to stop his and Li Mingjin's wedding? If so, how he would stop it?In the past life, this event had nothing to do with his wedding with Li Mingjin. Shen Mingyun was busy making money, while Luo Shuyu was busy getting married, waiting for marriage in Luo Mansion, and they had nothing to do with each other.In the book, only Shen Mingyun's planning for this event and communication with people were written, but at that time there was no such thing as Shen Mingyun wanting to destroy his marriage with Li Mingjin. What would he do?Seeing that there were less than ten days to be married.Shen Mingyun's warm-up period for the event was just 15 to 20 days. By then, the event would spread throughout the capital and became a hit.\"Sweeping pornography\" was not so easy, after all, in their era, the existence of brothels was legal.Wait, the Fourth Prince also seemed to have a brothel. Although it was inconspicuous, it was also a middle-to-upper-level passenger flow. In the later stage of the novel, when he and other princes scrambled for the throne, they used it to transmit information from various places, which was not small.What was the name of the brothel he opened? It was definitely not Huancai Pavilion. This brothel had an official background but it was not as big as the fourth prince. In the book, no one knew who the owner of Huancai Pavilion was, not even Shen Mingyun, who had been dealing with people in Huancai Pavilion for a long time. This was also one of the places that Luo Shuyu was very puzzled when reading the book. It ended without explaining the content clearly, but later he didn't care too much. He just remembered it.Who was the owner of this Huancai Pavilion?Luo Shuyu wrote down this doubt for the time being.It was a cloudy day today, and it was finally cooler. Luo Shuyu sat in the yard to enjoy the shade after dinner.Ansan came first to report to Luo Shuyu about the information from Shen Mingyun today.Shen Mingyun's actions were indeed different, and it was difficult not to be remembered.\"What other feats did Shen Mingyun do today?\" He was now preparing to marry, and he couldn't run out every day, so he waited for Ansan to report Shen Mingyun's situation every day, and then made plans.Ansan respected Luo Shuyu like he respected the third prince. After all, he was the future third imperial concubine, and he didn't dare to be sloppy when he did things.\"He was writing and drawing in the yard today. I saw that he wrote a list. I didn't know what it is used for, so I copied it down for gongzi to see.\" Ansan then handed over his copied list.Luo Shuyu smiled decisively when he saw the list: \"So it is, he has an idea.\"Facing Luo Shuyu, Ansan didn't feel the same sense of oppression as the third prince: \"I don't know what gongzi means?\"Luo Shuyu: \"You know he recently wants to cooperate with the brothels to start a program called Hua Kui 101.\"Ansan: \"I know, the relevant leaflets have already started to be distributed outside, and many people have started to ask about this.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Then you know the process of this program, How to choose those hua kui?\"\"About singing and dancing?\" Ansan guessed.Shen Mingyun's secrecy skills were quite in place. Now he first let the brothel set up the scene and did the relevant design, invited the audience, and then the most confidential one was the selection of the Hua Kui ranking mentor, and the intiator of the whole show.Luo Shuyu: \"There are singing and dancing, but the most important thing is group dance, vigorous singing and dancing, you may not have heard of it.\"Ansan: \"Ansi is the most proficient in music theory, he has never heard of it?\"Luo Shuyu: \"The most dazzling national dance, Xiao pingguo, Haicao wu, Kaluli, have you heard of it?\"(Xiao pingguo = little apple, Haicao wu = seawed dance, Kaluli = Calories)(\u6700\u70ab\u6c11\u65cf\u821e\uff0c\u5c0f\u82f9\u679c\uff0c\u6d77\u8349\u821e\uff0c\u5361\u8def\u91cc. These are names of modern dances, googling for more information)Ansan shook his head.Luo Shuyu: \"Have you heard of pole dancing, striptease, hula dancing?\"Ansan shook his head again.Ansan: \"However, I seem to have seen the names of these songs on a piece of paper by Shen Mingyun.\" Ansan was amazed, \"How did you know that?\"He had heard people sang these songs at the gathering in the harem, but the songs were too straightforward and noisy, so he didn't like to listen to them. Now that he thought about it, it was really thanks to his outstanding memory.Ansan: \"...\" Luo Gongzi was more powerful than the master!Luo Shuyu continued: \"Keep watching, and report to me in time if there is any new situation.\"Ansan: \"Yes.\"\"Wait.\" Luo Shuyu stopped him again, \"Bring me something for Li Mingjin.\"Ansan: \"Yes.\"After half an hour, Ansan appeared at the Third Prince's Mansion, stood in Li Mingjin's study, reported the day's work, and presented a small box.The box was unlocked and could be opened at any time.Li Mingjin was looking forward to it, and twisted his fingers, wanting to open it but was a little nervous.In the end, curiosity overcame nervousness, and he wanted to know what Luo Shuyu gave him.A white rounded little finger jade appeared in front of him.Li Mingjin picked up the jade with engraved a \"ten\" at the bottom. What does this mean?After thinking about it for a long time, Li Mingjin thought about what it meant, and put it away for the time being. He could ask about it on the day of their marriage. He had calculated everything, and there were thirteen days until the day of their marriage!Afterwards, Li Mingjin automatically filtered out the part of Luo Shuyu's information: \"He still has the ability to remember it?\"Ansan: \"Yes, Luo Gongzi told this subordinates himself.\"Li Mingjin said to himself: \"I think it will be the same in the future. Can he remember my preferences?.\"Ansan: \"...\" No, is that all you think of?Forget it, he had also witnessed the beginning of a relationship, and fully understood what a man in love could think about.Time passed by, and there were still three days before they got married.Luo Shuyu learned from Ansan that Li Mingjin had handed over the waterwheel drawings to a trustworthy person, and good news would come soon.After waiting for more than ten days, Li Mingjin couldn't wait for Luo Shuyu's small box every day, counting the days every day, and looking forward to it very much.Li Mingjin was now looking forward to Luo Shuyu's text messages and small boxes every day, and he also gave Luo Shuyu something. Yesterday was the sugar man he used to look down on the most, and today was Luo Shuyu's favorite green sweet-scented osmanthus cake in the pastry shop. He didn't know what to send tomorrow.Luo Shuyu never thought that the original Li Mingjin actually could treat him so well. If he gave him a little more trust, a little more care, and a little less indifference in his previous life, maybe the ending would be different.The closer to the day he got married, the more restless he became, for fear that Shen Mingyun would make a fool of himself that he didn't know about.After eating the sweet-scented osmanthus cake in his hand, Luo Shuyu patted his trousers and stood up. He was about to go to the garden in the house.Luo Renshou had a hobby, that was planting flowers, he liked to collect fresh flowers, and now there were many in every season.Luo Shuyu was bored in the yard for a long time, thinking about where to go, and you could go to see the scenery of Luofu.He hadn't come out to breathe for a long time, and when he looked at Luofu, he had a different feeling.There were many kinds of bamboo in the walls of Luofu. It looked very comfortable in summer. The words \"elegant\", \"clean\" and \"indisputable\" were not exaggerated.Slowly swaying, he arrived at the back garden that Luo Renshou specially set aside.Luo Renshou had such a hobby, so he naturally set aside a yard to grow the flowers he bought from other places. Of course, there were also some that the officials below gave him as a gift. This hobby would bring him benefit in the end. It was also a good place to visit for many like-minded colleagues, and occasionally played chess and drank tea in the yard full of plants.There was a plantain bush in the middle of the garden, which looked a little sweet in summer.Luo Shuyu stood in the shade of greenery and fanned the air with a fan.Qingwang asked Luo Shuyu if he was thirsty. When he went out, he specially brought a water bottle and followed by the maid. Originally, he could just go out and strolled around, but Grandma Feng said that she couldn't rest assured without people, Luo Shuyu still wanted to persevere. As for her own thoughts, Grandma Feng later became anxious and said that this was all the order of the Third Prince.Just as he was about to continue looking around, he heard a man and a woman chatting and laughing. Luo Shuyu raised his hand to make the people behind him quiet down and listen to them.Luo Shuyu was blocked by bushes in front of them, and the two of them didn't notice his existence.The next person were cheating?No, he should had heard this man's voice.The more he listened, the worse Luo Shuyu's face became, and he tightly usurped the fan in his hand!\"Master, you can't forget what you promised Ping'er. You agreed to accept me this year.\"\"Good Ping'er, how could I forget about this.\" Can it be done?\"\"Indeed, I promise you to do it right away!\"\"How many times have you said it, can you count it? I think it's better to tell the third gongzi about it, anyway, I don't mean to look at you!\"\" Don't worry, Pinger, your third gongzi is going to enter the third prince's mansion, can he trust you? Doesn't he always care about things? No one will know about his mother.\"\"Master, Pinger also knows. You took advantage of me. Back then, I was favored by my madam, and no one could suspect me. When the third gongzi marries to the third prince's mansion, no one will be suspicious. You must remember your promise, otherwise I will, I will inform the third gongzi about this, and make a fuss.\"\"Don't worry, I will ask you to come over and marry you as a concubine, so you don't need to be someone else.\"\"That's a good deal, uncle. Master, please remember that I have evidence in my hand that my madam didn't die of illness, but died of poisoning.\"\"Shh! Don't say it, this is Luofu, it's not good to be heard.\"The two wanted to continue to be intimate .Luo Shuyu who was standing next to them made a gesture, and the maid who followed immediately stepped forward and dragged the two out!The two man and woman were disheveled, the man's trousers wasn't tied, the woman's underwear was exposed, and the rope wasn't tied.Angered, Luo Shuyu kicked Liu Yong lower body forcefully: \"Very good, Liu Shi's younger brother Liu Yong, my mother's maid Ping'er who served her when she was alive, you are so good!\"Liu Yong was still stunned when he was pulled out, and then there was a sharp pain in his lower body. He clutched his lower part and fell to the ground: \"Ahhhhh!\"The truth came too suddenly, Luo Shuyu pinched his brows and immediately turned to his side and said in a cold voice: \"Take care of them and lock them up separately! Qingwang went to find someone to invite the master back, and said that there was a major matter of life at home and he needs to come back and make up his mind!\"Ping'er knelt on the ground and wanted to hug Luo Shuyu's thigh, but was kicked away by the maid next to Luo Shuyu.\"Ah! Third, Third gongzi, I, I was forced back then! It was Mrs. Liu who forced me!\"Luo Shuyu stared at Liu Yong and Ping'er, his mother really didn't die of illness!Mrs. Liu, I want you to pay for your life!The author has something to say:The Third Prince: That kick looks a bit painful...Luo Shuyu: Try it?Third Prince: No, no.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the same time, he also sent someone to call Luo Shumo and Luo Shuhan home. If anything happened, they could also be used.On the way home, he also asked the servant who came looking for him: \"What's going on?\"\"Master, I don't know, it was Qingwang, who is next to the third gongzi, who sent me to inform you to go back, saying it's a matter of human life. It 's a big event.\"Luo Renshou pinched his brows in distress: \"Shu Yu? What's wrong with him?\"The servant couldn't answer him, Luo Renshou stroked his right eye that was beating non-stop, feeling a little uneasy in his heart.wasn't the matter about Luo Shuyu's dowry already given to him? Why there was still trouble, and what was he doing? His father was now like a decoration, and he (LSY) had been leading him by the nose recently.Luo Renshou pondered in his heart what was going on.Back at the mansion, the housekeeper was already waiting at the door. He saw him looking flustered. He led Luo Renshou into the hall and said, \"Master, something really happened this time.\"Luo Renshou asked him as he walked: \"What the hell is going on, why are you calling me back in such a hurry? I'm busy.\"The housekeeper hesitated for a moment, then whispered: \"Madam's brother Liu Yong was having an affair with the maid Ping'er in our garden and was caught by the third gongzi and was arrested on the spot, the maid cried and said that the madam forced her to do something, while Liu Yong was kicked by the angry third gongzi, and he rolled on the ground for a long time in pain, and just recovered. Now the third gongzi locked them up separately, and no one is allowed to see them. He also called madam to the hall, and I saw the third gongzi looked like he was going to eat madam. He also called all the guards of the third prince's mansion, and now no one is allowed to enter the hall.\"Luo Renshou caught the point, his face ashen: \"You said that Liu Yong had an affair with the maid in the garden? His house is still a brothel!\"The housekeeper was also helpless: \"Master, that fornicating maid served Mrs. Chen back then.\"The housekeeper was shrewd and didn't say what he guessed, but only reminded Luo Renshou of the well-known things.Luo Renshou always felt that he was churning with energy and blood now, but after spending many years in the officialdom, he was still safe.What did Luo Shuyu find?The only thing that stimulated Luo Shuyu the most recently was his mother's affairs. When he mentioned this, Luo Renshou felt that it was another troublesome thing.After catching Ping'er and Liu Yong on the spot, Grandma Feng called the third prince's mansion's people who were guarding outside to enter Luo Mansion to protect Luo Shuyu. Now some were guarding Liu Yong's door and some were in the hall. At this time, Ping'er in the hall was strictly guarded by several maids, who blocked her mouth to prevent her from speaking, and bound her hands and feet to prevent her from self-harm.Liu Shi was \"invited\" by Luo Shuyu before. At first, she thought Luo Shuyu had a dowry matter with her, but when she entered the hall, she found that her legs were weak after seeing Ping'er. Where is this just a little things!Her brother Liu Yong happened to come to her this afternoon to ask for money. A few days ago, because she had to make up for Chen's dowry, she was even deprived of her qualifications as a housekeeper. Where did she has money now! She scolded Liu Yong and told him to get out. Who would have thought that he was so daring to have an affair with Ping'er in Luo Mansion, and she almost passed out of anger after hearing it, and when she saw Luo Shuyu's cold face, her legs were even weaker, and she couldn't even stand still.She wanted to be helped when she passed out on the grounds, but Grandma Feng was an old hand from the palace, and there were some ways to deal with her tricks of pretending to faint at every turn, and Grandma Feng pinched her twice to neutralize her skin. Immediately she was honest and didn't dare to go against the cold-faced Luo Shuyu.She couldn't faint, she could still cry, Luo Shuyu didn't say anything, she continued to cry, until her children came to rescue her, and until the master came back!When Luo Renshou walked to the hall, he saw two guards with swords standing at the door with a solemn expression. The guards saw Luo Renshou and the housekeeper coming in and let them in.Luo Renshou put on airs: \"Are you from the Third Prince's Mansion?\"The guard : \"Yes, Lord Shangshu, I'm under the command of the Third Prince to protect the third gongzi's safety.\"Luo Renshou angrily rebuked: \"It's totally unreasonable, there is still something happen to my son when he is in my home. If you can't go because of me, you can leave Luo Mansion quickly.\"The guard said again: \"I hope Lord Shangshu understands, it's difficult to obey orders, and I will leave Luo Mansion after the third gongzi's affairs are finished, and I will not embarrass the adults.\"Luo Renshou had nothing to do, and threw his sleeves and went into the house.If it was the crown prince and the eldest prince, he would still be able to play, but the third prince was not afraid of anything, and even His Majesty couldn't control him.Luo Renshou said again: \"You guys are completely clueless.\"The guards scolded him in their heart without replying. Compared with the punishment of their master, Luo Shangshu's words were nothing more than a painless scolding.At this time, the servants of Luo Mansion were all around, the housekeeper scolded them, and everyone shrank their necks and left to work.Luo Renshou was annoyed at the door, and when he entered the hall, he saw Ping'er who was kneeling on the ground and tied up with five flowers knot.Liu Shi burst into tears, and when she saw Luo Renshou, her crying became louder. Luo Shuyao and Luo Shuyue stood behind her, for fear that Grandma Feng and others behind Luo Shuyu would come to pinch people again, and the rest of the servants were all locked out, and no one was allowed to come in.Luo Shuyue first complained to Luo Renshou: \"Father, save mother quickly. The third brother is simply unreasonable. He detains mother here, and she is not allowed to go anywhere. You must decide for us!\"Luo Shuyue shed tears in cooperation. Compared to Luo Shuyu, who was sitting on the side with a sullen face, the three of them looked very innocent, like a little white flower swaying in the wind, which was lovable.Liu Shi said weakly: \"Master...\" Compared with the two ignorant childrens, she panicked and asked Luo Renshou for help.Luo Renshou looked at Luo Shuyu: \"Shu Yu, what do you mean?\"Compared with when he first heard the truth, Luo Shuyu was much calmer now: \"Father, do you want your good wife to explain to you?\"Liu Shi struggled Said: \"Master, I don't know anything, that girl must have framed me!\"Luo Shuyu said leisurely: \"How does my father feel about my mother's sudden death, I didn't know how to distinguish between being sick and being poisoned when I was young. What kind of symptoms, I think you can remember a lot of things when you recall your memories.\"Luo Renshou didn't expect Luo Shuyu to pursue his mother's death on the way back, let alone Luo Shuyu directly arrested Liu Shi.Luo Renshou said, \"Your mother died of illness, and the doctor's diagnosis at that time was lung disease.\"\"A doctor from Zhongdetang?\" Luo Shuyu sneered, \"I heard their staff said that doctor Liang, who treated my mother back then and said that she was ill, the doctor left after making a fortune, and his whereabouts are still unknown. How could a doctor disappear immediately after my mother died, there is nothing wrong here, do you believe it yourself?\"With a bang, Luo Shuyu threw the teacup in his hand. It fell to the ground and was torn apart. A few small fragments flew to Liu Shi's feet, making her shrink back to the chair in fright: \"Ah!\"Luo Renshou was also taken aback by Luo Shuyu's appearance: \"Luo Shuyu, what are you doing!\"Luo Shuyu raised his voice and said sternly: \"What am I doing?, I just want to get justice for my mother, Liu Shi not only embezzled my mother's dowry, she is also the culprit who killed my mother! You want to ask me for evidence again. Is that right? Liu Yong and Ping'er are both here. I can still hear what they said during their fornication today. The servants who passed by when they were disheveled should have seen it, but don't say that I slanders them. A few old maid checked Ping'er's body to see if she had just been with a man! Father, I asked you to come back to deal with this matter today because I have lived in peace for nearly 18 years. Give you and Luo Mansion a face, and take full care of your kindness for raising me, otherwise they will be in the yamen or the prison of the Ministry of Punishment. You can measure it yourself!\"Luo Renshou didn't show a fatherly gesture at this moment, and said solemnly: \"Are you threatening me?\"Luo Shuyu wasn't afraid at all, and sarcastically said: \"It's really funny, I have a reason to discuss with you, but you actually said that I threatened you, since you want to cover up Liu Shi, that's okay, I'll take these two people away. I'll throw it directly to the yamen, oh no, it's more appropriate to hand it over to the Ministry of Punishment.\"Liu Shi's legs were not only weak now, she couldn't stand anymore after listening to Luo Shuyu's words, she couldn't argue, she was just allright just now, now she knelt directly on the ground: \"Master, don't hand Liu Yong over to the Ministry of Punishment, I admit it, I admit it, it's my fault, I did everything in those days, and it has nothing to do with Liu Yong, he is the next generation of our Liu family. You can't go to the Ministry of Punishment, he will die!\"Luo Shuyu really felt bored and said to her: \"Liu Auntie, you don't need to cry in front of me, why didn't you think that others would cry when you were poisonous back then, what's the use of crying now, no one bullies you, who you will show it to?\"Luo Renshou, who was shown it, said, \"...\" He had always liked Liu Shi's pear blossoms and rain, and once in a while, a drop of tears would make him soft-hearted. Luo Shuyu really directly pierced his thoughts as a man.But now it was indeed a matter of human life, he had to think of a way, he slowed down his voice: \"Shu Yu, allow me to think about it.\"Luo Shuyu didn't give him time: \"Do you still need to think about it? A human life, or that's your attitude to your former wife? I'm really impressed today.\"Luo Shuyue, who was standing beside him, was obviously not as badly hit as Luo Shuyao, who was so frightened that he felt from the chair, his mother actually Poisoned to kill, Luo Shuyue was calmer: \"I see the third brother, you are using my uncle to force my mother to admit her fault, what direct evidence do you have to prove that my mother killed someone? My mother doesn't even dare to kill a chicken, so what about she killed your mother.\"Luo Shuyu also looked at Luo Shuyue who suddenly spoke up: \"Oh? According to what you mean, I forced your uncle to do bad things in Luo Mansion and fornicated with the maid? Is it the rights I gave him, or Father has been tolerant to him so far, Luo family is your Liu family's back garden, right? If you want to kill people, kill people, if you want to play with women, you can play with women! Luo Shuyue, don't forget, your surname is Luo, not Liu.\"Because the object of her power was Luo Shuyu, and pushing Luo Shuyu was completely easy to crush him, but here Luo Shuyue was facing Luo Shuyu who had dealt with the royal family for five years, and she hadn't yet reached this ability.At this time, Luo Shuyue was in a dilemma. To help Liu's family meant not to treat herself as Luo's family, to eat inside and outside, didn't help Liu Shi, but this was her mother, so she had to kneel down and beg Luo Renshou: \"Father, you must decide for mother!\"At this time, Luo Renshou even felt that he had been led by Luo Shuyu. From the day he received the imperial edict, he had lost the respect he had for his father. Luo Renshou knew that Luo Shuyu called him back not to discuss with him, but to let him accept the next processing result.He sat slumped on the mater chair: \"Since Liu Shi has admitted it, I have nothing to say.\" He was already dissatisfied with Liu Shi used Luo Mansion's money to help Liu family, and he had no objection to use Luo Shuyu's hand to deal with Liu Yong.Liu Shi was no longer a pitiful pear flower with tears in her eyes, but her tears were flowing and her hair was messy: \"Master, I, I don't want to die, don't send me to the yamen, Shumo and Shuhan can't have a killer mother, master!\"Luo Renshou didn't say a word, Liu Shi crawled in front of Luo Shuyu: \"Shu Yu, I really did the things, I know that paper can't hold fire, but please let your eldest brother and second brother go, they have never done anything to you, can you please let them go?\"Luo Shuyu asked her sharply: \"When you poisoned my mother, did you ever think about letting go of my mother? She was killed by you. The whole family still kill her son!\"Liu Shi couldn't say a word, she twitched her mouth: \"It's my fault, it's my ghost, it's my wife's position, it's me, it's me!, Shu Yu, I was wrong, I was really wrong!\"Luo Shuyu pushed her away and said, \"Beishan Nunnery, cut her hair and becomes a nun, and she has to be accompanied by someone. If she wants to return to the secular world, wait until I die.\"Luo Shuyue said angrily: \"Luo Shuyu, you want my mother to die, is the nunnery reserved for people?\"Luo Shuyu sneered: \"My mother is dead, she is not dead yet, Just eat some plain food and recite the scriptures, what's wrong?\"At this point, Luo Renshou sighed, \"What else?\" He knew that Luo Shuyu had more to say.When Luo Shuyao and Luo Shuyue heard this, they looked at their father who had always been there in disbelief, and then rushed to Liu Shi, hugging her head and crying with her.Luo Shuyu told him clearly: \"Liu family used to be just a poor businessman. Now all the shops are subsidized by my mother's dowry. All of them are taken back. I've been in prison for more than ten years.\"Luo Renshou closed his eyes and opened them again: \"Okay, I'll handle it.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Ping'er, I'll also send her to the yamen.\" As for the reason, he knew that Luo Renshou would find a way.Ping'er, who had been unable to speak, slumped to the ground, she knew she was finished.Luo Shuyu asked Luo Renshou, \"Does my father have anything else to say?\"Luo Renshou was both sentimental and regretful: \"It's a pity that your mother didn't give birth to you as a man.\"At this time, Luo Shuyu thought of a sentence Shen Mingyun often said in the book: everyone born equally.what about a man or a ger?Said Cao Cao and Cao Cao would arrive.Shen Mingyun's high voice came from outside the door: \"Who are you, why don't you let me in?\"Luo Shuyu said to the door, \"Let him in.\"Shen Mingyun really came in, and saw Liu Shi, Luo Shuyao, and Luo Shuyue kneeling on the ground, he looked at Luo Shuyu unfriendly.\"What are you doing to them?\"Luo Shuyu asked him back: \"You want to save the murderer?\"Shen Mingyun was stunned: \"...What murderer?\" He just came to save people because of mission!Luo Shuyu got up and looked at Luo Renshou: \"I hope my father keeps his promise.\"Luo Renshou seemed to be ten years older and nodded weakly. When he looked at Liu Shi, his eyes were complicated.When Luo Shuyu was walking out, Shen Mingyun suddenly whispered: \"The king of heaven covers the earth tiger.\"The Demon of The Pagoda Town.Luo Shuyu pretended not to understand, and left with an expressionless face, ignoring the three crying mother and childs behind and Ping'er who was lying on the ground.Shen Mingyun asked the system: \"Is he a transmigrator?\"The system didn't answer, but sent Shen Mingyun two words: Mission failed! ! !Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I\u2019m The Vicious Cannon Fodder In The BookCH 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuo Shuyu knew as soon as he turned around that Shen Mingyun was testing him.\"The king of heaven covers the earth tiger, the demon of the pagoda town\" appeared in the book before. He remembered that Shen Mingyun used it as a code for connecting with people. They were not people of their era, and they wouldn't pick up the next sentence after hearing the previous sentence.Shen Mingyun jumped out in a hurry, but asked him to remember this point, it should be useful in the future, he really thanked him for reminding him.After Luo Shuyu returned to Ruyiyuan, he started to write letter to Li Mingjin after dinner. Today he was in a bad mood, so there was only one sentence.Now writing letters had became their after-dinner habit.Letting Liu Shi stayed in the nunnery was already the biggest punishment for her. After Liu Yong and Ping'er were imprisoned, it was almost the same for the rest of their lifes. If they wanted to live a happy life of putting on good clothes, reaching out for food with only opening their mouths, it would be a dream that would never come true.Liu Shi's case happened suddenly and was resolved quickly.Luo Shuyu drank another bowl of the soothing soup sent by Grandma Feng before laying down, but he didn't fall asleep. His mind was full of the words of Ping'er and Liu Yong today. He wanted to kill Liu Shi to vent his hatred, but he also had to consider for Li Mingjin and his future children, to accumulate virtue, and hope that the mother in the spirit of heaven could bless their family to spend this life safely.In the afternoon, the old lady knew that Luo Shuyu had another fight with Liu Shi, but she never expected that a few days before Luo Shuyu got married, she would find out the cause of Chen Shi's death, and it was Liu Shi's poison, Liu Shi served her for many years, and when the old lady heard it, she was terrified, and she was so angry that she called Luo Renshou to Fushouju and scolded him.\"Shou'er, Chen Shi was the one who asked for you back then, and she served me for ten years. Although I know she despised me as a rude old woman, she is also your wife. How could Liu Shi kill her? It's extremely vicious, and her heart is made of poisonous juice. I still trust her so much! I must let her know her fault!\"Luo Renshou said: \"Mother, don't be so angry! If Shu Yu is not in the courtyard that day I don't know if he would meet Liu Yong who acted erratically.\"\"You still don't know that Liu Yong? I listened that Liu Shi gave him a lot of subsidy, he ran to Luo Mansion every two or three days. Liu family wants money, and now when they become serious relatives, they treat Luo Mansion as their own home!\" The old lady patted her chest, \"What the hell did our Luo family do to have such relatives.\"\"Mother here drink the ginseng tea.\" Luo Renshou stroked her back, \"Don't be angry, I am also responsible for this matter.\"The old lady scolded: \"If you are not responsible, no one is responsible, but Shu Yu has taken control. Well, before he gets married, he made a mess at home!\"Just as they were talking, the brothers Luo Shumo and Luo Shuhan were outside begging to see the old lady and Luo Renshou.The old lady wiped her tears: \"What are you doing? My grandchildren will suffer this kind of crime.\"Luo Renshou was more tired now than ever. Luo Shumo and Luo Shuhan came back late. After knowing about their mother, they were still a little confused. Yesterday, the family was safe and sound, but today it had became like this. Their mother suddenly turned into a murderer and poisoned Chen Shi, which she herself admitted it. If you learned about this from the mouths of the third aunt and the sixth aunt, they would definitely be beaten and scolded by them.So sudden, so sudden!The two brothers ran to the old lady in\u00a0 hope that the old man could beg Luo Shuyu for mercy. They couldn't accept the sudden result. How could the mother commit murder when she was good? Why did she suddenly plead guilty? Did their uncle do something illegal outside?.The old lady kept crying, and the two brothers were finally taken to the study by Luo Renshou, and the old lady was not allowed to ask Luo Shuyu.Luo Shumo asked: \"Father, is there something wrong with this matter? Why is it so sudden?, how could my mother do such a thing to the eldest lady?.\"Luo Shuhan's temper wasn't as calm as Luo Shumo, and he had a hot temper: \"Sure enough someone harmed my mother! Father, Luo Shuyu must have framed my mother!\"The two of them gave Luo Renshou a headache: \"It was Shu Yu who heard what your uncle said when he had an affair with the maid. Go, there are witnesses and evidence, they found relevant evidence in Ping'er's room in the afternoon! How can you justify that you are going to go to court with Shu Yu? It's already hard evidence, and your mother's mind was very clear when she recognized her crime. What are you doing, do you think it would be better to hand over your mother to the yamen!\"Luo Renshou had no choice, Luo Shuyu waited with the evidence in front of him, what he could do was very limited, and there was nothing left for him at all. The chance to rescue Liu Shi was this aggressive and ruthless method.However, if Liu Shi didn't have such a handle, Luo Shuyu wouldn't make a trouble to this point. After all, Liu Shi was still greedy!Because of Luo Shuyu's dowry, Luo Renshou had a big headache. Now not only this, but even his wife had to cut her hair to become a nun. He didn't know how many rumors he had to bear.Luo Shumo had his own considerations, he frowned and asked Luo Renshou, \"If my mother is not here, what will happen to Shuyao and Shuyue's marriage?\"Luo Renshou said, \"Your grandmother will take care of it, you two should go back to rest first, and today I'm too tired.\" Now that he had made a decision, he couldn't change it. Moreover, Luo Shuyu had the third prince as a shield in his hand, which was the main reason why he couldn't help to exonerate Liu Shi.After Luo Shumo and Luo Shuhan left Luo Renshou's study, Luo Shuhan went directly to visit Liu Shi who was imprisoned in the ancestral hall, while Luo Shumo turned around and went to Luo Shuyu's Ruyiyuan.Luo Shuyu was so stimulated that he couldn't fall asleep today. After lying down, he got up again, thinking about his mother Chen Shi in his mind.His mother was a gentle woman who was knowledgeable and sensible. She had the charm of a Jiangnan woman of the Yangtze River. She always spoke very softly, her eyes were always squinted when she smiled, and she liked light-colored rouge. Always had her own set of principles.She and Luo Renshou seldom had any disputes, and they respected each other like guests. From the outsider's point of view, they had no son, but Chen Shi never pinned her hopes on it.In her spare time, she would guide Luo Shuyu to study, taught him the principles of life, taught him in music, chess, calligraphy and painting, never asked him to learn embroidery or did things he didn't like to do, she would always take care of her children.That memory was very beautiful. Luo Shuyu hadn't dreamed of his mother for a long time. He was afraid of losing this memories.In his last life, after his mother passed away, he no longer thought about his past with her. Now, when he thought back to the past, he could only sigh, and his mother's face was no longer clear. He was afraid that one day he would never be able to remember his mother's appearance again.It would be great if he was reborn back to when his mother was alive, at least he could save her, took her out of this man-eating Luo Mansion, let her saw how lovely her future grandson, and lived the idyllic life she had always longed for , you didn't have to fight back and forth with the woman in the back house every day.Luo Shuyu was thinking wildly when a sound came from outside.He asked what happened to Qingwang, who was sleeping outside, and Qingwang replied, \"The eldest gongzi is here.\"Luo Shuyu knew that he would definitely face him: \"Tell him to sit in the hall for a while, and I will come out after changing clothes.\"With this eldest brother, he really didn't want to talk seriously, thinking that he was here for Liu Shi's business, Luo Shuyu twitched the corners of his mouth.Although Luo Shumo had never been bad to him, he had never been nice to him. He always looked at him with cold eyes when he was bullied by Luo Shuyao and Luo Shuyue. He had never said a good word. After all, he was not his own younger brother. If you wanted to talk to him about affection, it didn't exist.When Luo Shuyu came out, Luo Shumo was drinking the tea served by the servants.It was still Luo Shumo who took the initiative to call Luo Shuyu: \"Shu Yu.\"Luo Shuyu cut to the point: \"Big brother came so late because of your mother.\"Luo Shumo bluntly admitted: \"Yes, I went to my father first. Understood, I came to apologize to you on behalf of my mother, not to intercede with her.\"Retreat to advance?Luo Shuyu sat across from him and said, \"I lost my mother when I was ten years old. My eldest brother is different from me. He was loved by father when he was born. You are a man, and I'm just a ger, and I never thought that there would be today, you will find out that your mother will be the murderer of my mother. Brother, if an apology is useful, what else do you need to do? Apologizing can't make my mother come back to life, and you won't be able to live my life in Luo's house over the years. Maybe you don't know.\"He was destined to be on the opposite side, and it was already thoughtful that he could sit down and talked peacefully.Luo Shumo thought about it when he came, first apologized to him, and then changed his mother's punishment.However, Luo Shuyu was sharp, and he was speechless. He no longer had the position to plead for his mother.Luo Shumo said, \"That's I'm harassing you.\" He was not stupid. If he paid more attention to Luo Shuyu in the early years, the result would have been different.Who knew, feng shui turned.After Luo Shumo left Luo Shuyu's Ruyiyuan, he hesitated between returning to his own courtyard and going to Shen Mingyun's courtyard.In the end, he chose to go to Youyou Xiaozhu.At this time, Shen Mingyun happened to be eating watermelon in the yard without image, and the black watermelon seed he spit out everywhere.\"Pfft! Putting watermelon in the well is really cool. It's no different from the iced one. Big cousin, why are you here? Come and eat a piece of watermelon, it's so sweet!\"\"No, I have something to discuss with you.\" Luo Shumo saw Shen Mingyun who was informal, and his heart throbbed, \"You can eat it, but as a ger, you should eat less cold things.\"Shen Mingyun wiped his mouth rudely: \"What do you want to discuss with me?\"Luo Shumo leaned into his ear and asked him in a low voice, \"Do you still remember a few days ago, when you asked me how to delay the marriage of the third prince and Shuyu, I suddenly had an idea.\"Shen Mingyun opened his eyes wide: \"Really?Luo Shumo saw Shen Mingyun with eyes full of tenderness, and wiped the watermelon seeds from the corner of his mouth with his fingertips: \"Naturally. \"Luo Renshou's affair with Liu Shi was suppressed by Luo Renshou. Recently, they had been preparing for Luo Shuyu's marriage. No one was allowed to mention this matter. Liu Yong and Ping'er had been sent to the yamen to wait for their punishments. This was Luo Renshou's reassurance for Luo Shuyu.For the next two days, Luo Shuyu's mind was focused on the preparation of the marriage and Shen Mingyun's movement, he wanted to know how he was going to ruin his wedding, but he didn't move much recently.Luo Shuyu was pinching a needle to sew an ugly sachet, and it pricked his finger when he didn't pay attention. He really was not suitable for such meticulous work, so he simply put it down and poured himself a glass of water.Just as he got up and poured water, Qingwang changed his recent behavior and rushed into the house in a hurry and said, \"Gongzi, the news just came from the Third Prince's Mansion, saying that something happened to the Third Prince!It's coming!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 Entering the PalaceLuo Shuyu walked around the room, and the ice basin placed around couldn't reduce the anger in his heart.This matter must be done by Shen Mingyun, and he still failed to guard against it!Now he couldn't wait to rush to Youyou Xiaozhu to drag Shen Mingyun out and beat him, but he couldn't, there was no evidence.With his thoughts going back and forth, Luo Shuyu's fingers were trembling: \"What the hell is going on?\"Qingwang followed his gongzi anxiously: \"Anjiu only passed me a message that something happened to the third prince, and I haven't had time to ask him what happened, he ran away without a trace.\"Grandma Feng deliberately comforted him: \"Gongzi, don't worry, perhaps the person who sent the message suddenly went back to answer his orders, and His Royal Highness the third prince will be fine.\"Luo Shuyu paced the room. Come and go, not a moment of silence.Grandma Feng also said, \"Gongzi, Your Highness the Third Prince has a good personality, so don't worry too much. Since Anjiu can come back to pass the news to you, it means that there is room for things to change, and it will be fine.\"\"But, the question is what happened to him now?\" Luo Shuyu was anxious, was there a problem with the drawing he gave Li Mingjin?It was useless for him to be anxious now, he had to think of a way: \"Did Qingwang send someone out to inquire?\"Qingwang said, \"I have already sent someone out to the Third Prince's Mansion to wait for the news, Gongzi, wait, maybe the good news will be reported later.\"Luo Shuyu was restless, feeling up and down in his heart.In the evening, the people who was sent out to the Third Prince's Mansion came back, but didn't get the corresponding answer, and the Third Prince didn't return to the Mansion.Luo Shuyu: \"Did you go to the Ministry of Punishment to ask?\"Qingwang said: \"Our people can't enter the Ministry of Punishment, but it seems that the top and bottom of the Ministry of Punishment are under martial law now, and they will be questioned when they stand outside, so it's hard to speculate what happened.\"At this point in the past, Ansan and Anjiu would come over to deliver letters, or reported to him the situation on Shen Mingyun's side, but now there were no figures of the two of them, it seemed that things were not easy!If you couldn't figure it out yourself, it didn't mean that others couldn't. Luo Mansion had a ready-made one, and Luo Renshou would definitely know!Luo Shuyu rushed directly to Luo Renshou's study. When he arrived, he found that no one was there. He asked the little servant again, and when he learned that Luo Renshou in aunt Cheng yi niang's room was having meals, he rushed over directly.(y\u00ed ni\u00e1ng = maternal aunt; father's concubine, before LSY calls LS aunt (yi niang))Cheng yi niang's maid was almost frightened by Luo Shuyu's aggressive appearance, and even forgot about the report.Luo Renshou, who had just returned to the house, had just swallowed a mouthful of soup, and when he saw Luo Shuyu who rushed in, he almost choked: \"cough, cough.\" He wiped the corners of his mouth, Luo Renshou put on the air of being a father. His wife was gone because of him, and now he went straight to his concubine to make trouble. Luo Renshou said, \"What's the matter with you?\"Luo Shuyu said, \"Father, I have something to ask. It's a big deal.\"Luo Renshou was really afraid of him. Afraid that he would talk about some old things in front of his concubine, he waved his hands and got up and asked him to go to the study together.Occasionally, there would be servants passing by on the road, and they all looked at them curiously. It was very rare to see the master and the third gongzi walking together. Today, the sun seemed to be coming out from the west.When he arrived at the study, Luo Shuyu changed his calmness before: \"Father, what rumors did you hear about the third prince today?\"At present, Luo Renshou and Luo Shuyu were not really ripped off. Luo Renshou was still a little apprehensive about the third prince and his marriage contract .Luo Renshou didn't understand what he meant: \"What did you hear? What happened to the third prince?\"Luo Shuyu didn't answer but asked: \"Did the third prince go to court today?\" .\" Luo Renshou finally saw that Luo Shuyu was in the wrong mood. \"What do you want to ask?\"Luo Shuyu said bluntly, \"He seems to be in an accident.\"\"Accident?\" Luo Renshou raised his eyebrows, \"What happened? \"Although the current Luo Renshou was strategizing in the court, he was still relatively low-key. He was also complacent that the Luo family could marry the royal family for a while. Now he was looking forward to Luo Shuyu marrying into the Third Prince's Mansion, just to increase his influence in the court.But now Luo Shuyu asked him if something happened to the third prince? He was also puzzled.What could happen to the third prince?Luo Shuyu shook his head: \"I don't know either, I'm not here to ask you if I know.\"Luo Renshou asked Luo Shuyu, \"Where did you get the news?\"Luo Shuyu said, \"The people in the third prince's mansion told Grandma Feng that he hasn't returned to the Third Prince's Mansion yet, father, we might go to the Ministry of Punishment to inquire.\" There was no problem with this reason.Luo Renshou: \"Okay, I'll send someone to the Ministry of Punishment to ask.\", he just kept in mind how Luo Shuyu knew the whereabouts of the third prince, thinking about whether the third prince was sincere to Luo Shuyu. You couldn't tear your face off with Luo Shuyu.Luo Shuyu just came back from the rebirth, and finally saw some hope. Now Li Mingjin had an accident again. He was not sure what happened to him at this time in his previous life, but he was really anxious and scared now, and the picture before his death in his previous life was in his mind again. Reverberating, his chest became more and more stuffy and uncomfortable, he knew that it was useless to worry, he could only wait.Luo Renshou was about to send someone out to inquire about the news, but the butler ran in and said that an eunuch had come from the palace and wanted to see Luo Renshou and Luo Shuyu.Luo Renshou and Luo Shuyu went to the front hall with doubts. This eunuch was serving in the queen's palace on a daily basis, and he came to pass on the queen's oral decree to declare Luo Renshou and Luo Shuyu to enter the palace.Luo Renshou asked the eunuch what happened to his father and son so the queen called them. The eunuch shook his head and said that he was just an emissary, and he was not too sure, they would know as long as they went to the palace to see the queen.The father and son were rarely in sync with each other, so they got into the carriage to the palace uneasily.Luo Shuyu didn't have much time to deal with the queen in his last life. She suddenly announced that they entered the palace. It should be related to Li Mingjin. Now he was not only anxious, but also overwhelmed. Why the queen looking for with their father and son?While sitting in the carriage to calm down, Luo Shuyu pinched a blue mark on the palm of his hand, and Luo Shuyu took a deep breath until Eunuch Chen reminded them that they arrived.Luo Renshou couldn't say anything. He and Luo Shuyu had no common language at all. He couldn't understand Luo Shuyu at all now. He had changed too much. At the same time, he also found that Luo Shuyu's attitude towards the third prince was very strange. The two had never met before, and this marriage was just marriage by the royal family. Why did he care about the third prince so much, and it was uncertain if he could live well with the third prince in the future, okay? Were they in love with each other?Looking at Luo Shuyu with a pale face, Luo Renshou couldn't help thinking of Luo Shuyu's biological mother. Luo Shuyu inherited his mother's appearance. She was white and clean, stubborn and strong. Now Luo Shuyu had completely inherited this.Along the way, the father and son didn't speak, their thoughts were different.When they arrived at the Queen's Changchun Palace, it was already the beginning of the lantern.An eunuch was already reporting the arrival of the Luo family's father and son.The two entered the hall and found that there was not only the queen, but also Emperor Tiansheng.Luo Shuyu paid respectful visit to them, and was not at all cowardly. Emperor Tiansheng called them up and gave them a seat.Neither Emperor Tiansheng nor the Queen had ever seen Luo Shuyu, but seeing his appearance and attitude now, they felt that he was quite atmospheric.Emperor Tiansheng didn't talk to them. He put down the tea cup in his hand, sighed, and said with some embarrassment: \"Aiqing, I'm so anxious to announce you here tonight, there may be something I need to discuss with you.\"(aiqing = something like my beloved official )Luo Renshou was disturbed by Emperor Tiansheng's attitude: \"This minister is frightened, I don't know what your majesty needs the minister to do.\"Emperor Tiansheng said: \"It's like this. This morning, Mingjin followed the people from the Ministry of Punishment out of the city to arrest a group of bandits. It was too dark at that time. After they chased to the edge of the cliff, a group of people disappeared. The person who came back to report said, Mingjin fell off the cliff when he was fighting with the Jiang Yang bandits, and now his life and death are unknown.\"Luo Shuyu's heart was half cold when he heard this, his face turned pale, and tears rolled in his eyes.Why did Li Mingjin suddenly go to arrest the Jiang Yang bandits?He didn't remember exactly what Emperor Tiansheng and Luo Renshou said later.Until Emperor Tiansheng asked him:\u00a0 \"Luo gongzi, three days later will be your wedding day with Mingjin. I have discussed with the queen, if Mingjin doesn't come back in three days, there are two options for you now, one is to postpone the wedding date, The other is to cancel the marriage with Mingjin, we will not embarrass you.\"Luo Shuyu quietly wiped away his tears, but his eyes were firm: \"Thank you Your Majesty and the Queen for being considerate, since Caomin has a marriage contract with the third prince, no matter whether life or death, I'm willing to marry him, and I'm willing to wait for his safe return, and I will never regret it!\"(c\u01ceo m\u00edn = the grass roots, the hoi polloi. Maybe it's the same like this humble me)Emperor Tiansheng and the queen were moved by Luo Shuyu's firm words. Although they didn't know if the two childrens had met before, the tears that burst out of Luo Shuyu's eyes wouldn't be fake. There was determination in their eyes. Emperor Tiansheng and the queen originally thought that they might cancel the two people's marriage contract, but now they had to reconsider it.It was not a bad thing for Li Mingjin to get a wife who was willing to follow him, and he (LSY) was not afraid of him. Even now, people didn't know his life and death, which put a lot of pressure on Luo Shuyu. If Li Mingjin really disappeared, Luo Shuyu could only guard a tablet in the future without marrying another, if he was still alive, this was a happy event and a blessing for him.The queen also wondered why she hadn't paid attention to Luo Shangshu's ger before, and was cut off by the third prince. Seeing that this child was so sensible, it was not a bad idea to give it to the crown prince, even Luo Shangshu didn't come from an aristocratic family, Luo Shuyu still had a good character.The queen asked Emperor Tiansheng: \"Then, Your Majesty, the wedding will continue as usual in the next three days?\"Emperor Tiansheng sighed: \"Since Luo Gongzi has no opinion and can afford to wait, then I will decide to let the wedding continue. Luo Aiqing , you have taught a virtuous son, I will thank you for Mingjin.\"Luo Renshou hurriedly knelt down: \"Your Majesty is too honorable, this is what this child should do.\"Luo Shuyu also knelt down, with a very sincere attitude. There was no dissatisfaction with the marriage. Such behavior had improved the impression of Emperor Tiansheng and the queen, and the queen was even more regretful in her heart.She also got Luo Shuyu's portrait when she was choosing the crown princess for the crown prince, but unfortunately she put it in the \"abandoned\" place because his eyes were too cold at that time, and now she regretted it a bit.Luo Shuyu didn't know what the queen was thinking. He lowered his head and thought about how Li Mingjin fell off the cliff.In the book, during this period of time, Shen Mingyun and the third prince had no interaction, not even a single word. The story revolved around him and Luo Shumo working on the renovation of the waterwheel together, and then it was the end of the year. Therefore, during this period, Luo Shuyu really didn't know what would happen to Li Mingjin.Li Mingjin, you will live, right?The author has something to say: I'm really hardworking.The Third Prince: Not only alive, but also very hard, very easy to use!Luo Shuyu: ...Go away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 It seems to be twistedAccording to reasoning, the disappearance of Li Mingjin should never happened in the last life, otherwise Luo Renshou and others wouldn't have been silent, and Shen Mingyun had a big mouth, how could the things he knew not be exposed, the fourth prince at this time had already hooked up with him. Together, the two had met privately several times.At this time, after the Emperor Tiansheng and the Empress decided to continue their marriage with the Luo family, they let them go back, and the father and son left the palace.In the process of returning from the palace, Luo Shuyu sat on the carriage and recalled the matter of entering the palace today.He was concerned, but he was also confused. When he heard about Li Mingjin's accident in the afternoon, he became uneasy. He just observed the\u00a0 Emperor Tiansheng and the empress from the corner of his eye, and neither of them were as worried as he thought. The Emperor Tiansheng shouldn't be so calm, was there any hidden meaning in it?Luo Renshou didn't know what Luo Shuyu was thinking. He looked at Luo Shuyu with admiration today. When the\u00a0 Emperor Tiansheng asked him how to choose, he thought that Luo Shuyu would regret it and directly mentioned the divorce, but he didn't expect him to think so much for the Luo family and fought for his face. He deliberately comforted Luo Shuyu, who made him looked at him differently: \"Don't worry too much about the third prince. When I look at His Majesty, I think he already sent people to look for him, and there should be news tomorrow morning.\"\"Well, I know.\" Luo Shuyu didn't really want to talk to him.Luo Renshou asked him: \"What do you think? If the third prince really never come back, you will have to live on your own for the rest of your life after you get married, and it's no different from a long-term with no companion.\"But as he said this sentence, the time was too unconvincing. He who just wanted to maintain a father-son relationship with him, this reminding him about Liu Shi who always be with him.Luo Shuyu, as soon as he heard his polite words said, \"No if, he will come back, father, if you are really good for me, don't say these words, why don't you send more people to help me find people now, I want to see people if he is still alive, and I want to see the corpse if he is dead.\"Luo Shuyu calmly said, he didn't look so fragile and sad like when he was in the palace. He believed that Li Mingjin was still alive, they hadn't married yet, and they hadn't done a lot of things that were left unfinished in their previous lifes, and he hadn't apologized to him yet.Luo Renshou felt that Luo Shuyu was too obsessed with Li Mingjin, as if he had made a private relationship with the third prince. As far as he knew, the two had never met before, so how could they had a deep relationship? What to think about, a big change in temperament would make a big change in decision, and it was also the glory of their Luo family to be able to enter the Third Prince's Mansion as an imperial concubine.After returning to the mansion, Luo Renshou didn't rest immediately, but ordered people to look for the third prince. Now, this marriage was on the mind of the Emperor Tiansheng. Purchasing, adding another 20% to Luo Shuyu's dowry.Compared with Luo Renshou's arrangement, Luo Shuyu was much simpler. He asked Grandma Feng if there was any news from the Third Prince's Mansion. Grandma Feng shook her head, and there was no need to say more comforting words, Luo Shuyu didn't want to hear it.He stood in front of the gorgeous green wedding dress that was stretched out, which was his wedding dress.In order to distinguish whether a woman was married or a ger was married, the Daxia Kingdom made a difference in the color of the wedding dress. The women wore red wedding dress, the gers wore green, and the men who greeted their relatives were all red. The ger's wedding dress was bold in color, and there were more stories than women. There were always people who say that red and green were the most suitable to make the difference between the ger and the woman.Luo Shuyu told himself that he couldn't fall down at this moment. Since Li Mingjin was fine in his last life, he would be fine in this life.Now he wanted to rush to Shen Mingyun's Youyou Xiaozhu to find him and beat him up, but that didn't help, it was the same sentence, as long as Shen Mingyun didn't admit it, he didn't have the slightest evidence to prove that he was related to this matter, and would only expose the matter of his rebirth.The chirping of insects and birds in the summer night was annoying, but to Luo Shuyu, it was the proof that he was alive. He sat in front of the window, waiting for the good news that would come tomorrow.Qingwang advised him to rest but was sent away by Luo Shuyu. The more he thought about it, the more he thought that Li Mingjin was definitely still alive. No matter whether others saw his jokes or not, at least he couldn't back down. Li Mingjin was his backing, and he would also be the person behind Li Mingjin,\u00a0 who could give him advice in the future, as long as they survived the current hurdle.He already had a new way to deal with Shen Mingyun in his heart, as long as Li Mingjin came back safely, as long as he came back.If Li Mingjin died early because of his rebirth, he wouldn't live alone. Before he died, he would really pull Shen Mingyun with him!He didn't sleep all night, and Luo Shuyu was still very energetic until the early morning, and he was not overly sad because the groom might not be present at the wedding.The sadness now was the most useless thing, he hadn't experienced these things? No matter how painful it was, could you let the person you love died in front of you?On a new day, the Luo Mansion began to clean up. The gardener took care of the plants in the mansion, and the maids tidied up the curtains and cleaned the courtyards.After Luo Shuyu had breakfast, he sat in the yard and fed his little goldfish.Just after throwing down a few feed grains, he heard the maid in the courtyard yelled: \"The Fifth gongzi is here!\"Luo Shuyu: ?Luo Shuyu raised his head and looked at Luo Shuyao who came towards him arrogantly.\"Luo Shuyu, I've heard all about it. You don't say anything about your life. You're still a trash.\"Luo Shuyu arrested his mother a few days ago, and she was still kneeling in the ancestral hall. It was said that the third prince was missing, and didn't know whether it was life or death. He may not even be able to come to greet\u00a0 relatives the day after tomorrow. If the third prince was gone, wouldn\u2019t Luo Shuyu become a widow? He actually had it today, it was really the feng shui turned around, and the words of sarcasm were not at ease.Luo Shuyu patted off the feed scrap in his hand, and said lightly, \"Where is the dog barking from? It usually eats unclean filth, so its mouth is so stinky.\"Luo Shuyao was once again scolded by Luo Shuyu. When he came, he lost in every fight , and he got angry again: \"Whoever you say eats filth!\" Even when he came to fight with him, Luo Shuyao didn't understand how Luo Shuyu became more and more brave.Luo Shuyao's three sentences revealed hypocrisy: \"Luo Shuyu, don't deceive people too much.\"The more Luo Shuyu looked at him, the more interesting it became: \"This is my yard, how did I deceive you, is it because I used fairy magic to deceive you? Luo Shuyao can't you use your pig brain?\" He was in a bad mood and didn't bother to be polite to him.Luo Shuyao pointed at Luo Shuyu: \"You, you, you!\" He originally meant to come over to teach him a lesson, to vent his anger for his mother, but he never thought about it and he was angry.Luo Shuyu: \"Go back if you have nothing to do, don't get in my way here.\"Luo Shuyao: \"Hmph, I'll see how you get married in the future!\"Luo Shuyu's face sank.Luo Shuyao said again: \"I'll see that you must worship with the chicken in the day after tomorrow!\"(if LMJ doesn't come, the chicken will be his substitute as a groom XD)Luo Shuyu said to grandma Feng: \"grandma Feng, send him out.\"Then, Luo Shuyao, who wanted to come over and satirize Luo Shuyu, was kicked out by two strong and powerful aunties, and once again suffered a loss from Luo Shuyu's hands, he couldn't dealt with it yet, so he could only stand at the door and stomped. He was about to leave Luo Shuyu's yard, and when he thought of something, he spit at Luo Shuyu's yard.\"Luo Shuyu, I curse you to grow old alone!\"Luo Shuyu stood in the yard and looked up at the sky. Even if Luo Shuyu worshipped with the chicken the day after tomorrow, he would still be the third prince's\u00a0 concubine who was married to the third prince.To blast Luo Shuyu away in the most straightforward way, Luo Shuyu felt very refreshed.After walking around the courtyard, he went to the study, asked Qingwang to prepare the ink, and wrote to Li Mingjin as usual.Another day passed in the blink of an eye.Luo Shuyu still hadn't received the news about Li Mingjin's safe return, and his heart sank more and more.It was night, and Luo Shuyu just fell asleep when a black shadow jumped over the wall, gently pushed open the window of Luo Shuyu's room, and jumped in easily.He walked in lightly, and when he saw Luo Shuyu sleeping curled up, he felt a lot more at ease. Hearing that he had\u00a0 disappeared, the Luo family came to bully him and so he came to take a look.At this time, Luo Shuyu had already fallen into a deep sleep, but he was very uneasy when he was dreaming, and he dreamed of the most tragic scene in his previous life. Once again, he went back to experience those inhuman days, and the corners of his eyes unknowingly shed tears.The shadow standing in front of the bed raised his hand and wiped it away quietly.Did Luo Shuyu dream about sad things related to him?The warm fingertips touched Luo Shuyu's cheek, Luo Shuyu seemed to feel it, he held the finger that rested on his cheek, and muttered: \"Li Mingjin, you will regret it if you dare to let me worship with the chicken.\"Li Mingjin was startled by his sudden voice, his movements were stiff, and he didn't dare to move, for fear of waking people up.Looking down again, Li Mingjin breathed a sigh of relief when he found that the man was still sleeping, but there was no more tears.After confirming that Luo Shuyu was no longer crying in his dream, Li Mingjin gently pulled his fingers and climbed over the wall to leave.At the wall, Li Mingjin asked Ansan: \"One of the marriage customs in our Daxia country is that the groom and the bride can't meet three days before the wedding. I met with him just now. Do you think it will affect our future fortunes?\"As the master's confidant, Ansan said smartly: \" Luo gongzi fell asleep, and he didn't see you, so it shouldn't be considered a meeting.\"Li Mingjin nodded with satisfaction: \"That makes sense.\" He confidently turned over and jumped off the wall.Ansan followed Li Mingjin with agile movements, and then he saw that Li Mingjin suddenly leaned against the wall and didn't move, he asked, \"Master, what's the matter with you?\"Li Mingjin paused: \"...it seems I have twisted my foot.\"Something to say:Third Prince: Wife, my leg is broken! QAQLuo Shuyu: ... I'd better worship with the chicken.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The third prince would marry Luo Shuyu, the ger of Luo Renshou, Minister of Rites.Recently, the mistress of Luo Mansion was detained in the ancestral hall, but she didn't make any mistakes in major matters.Luo Shuyu got up early in the morning to dress up and put on a complicated green wedding dress.The ger's grooming was different from that of women. The women's makeup was relatively heavy, while the ger was relatively simple and elegant. Luo Shuyu usually didn't wear makeup. Today, he had to be pressed in front of the dressing table to dress up, thrushed his eyebrows, applied powder light-colored rouge. He was fair-skinned, but he looked different today.Qingwang, as a servant looked at him who was going to get married, watched from the sidelines, and couldn't help but praised Luo Shuyu after putting on makeup: \"Gongzi, today is really handsome, the third prince will definitely be dumbfounded.\"Luo Shuyu didn't answer. Since that day, Luo Shuyao made a big fuss in his Ruyiyuan, all the masters in the whole house knew that something happened to the third prince, and 90% of them wouldn't appear at today's wedding, to say that another person replaced the third prince to welcome the relatives.Grandma Feng stared at Qingwang, the latter knew he had made a blunder, and silently retreated to the side, Grandma Feng was stubbornly changing the subject: \"Gongzi's makeup is just right, I feel heartbeat when I look at you, you deserve the title of the most beautiful ger in the capital.\"Luo Shuyu pulled out a small smile, and the haze on his face was covered by the powder.Grandma Feng brought him some snacks and whispered, \"gongzi, eat some first, it will take a while.\"Luo Shuyu nodded and ate some casually.No matter who came to welcome the relatives today, he was not afraid.Li Mingjin's life and death was uncertain now, and he couldn't go to the ceremony with joy.How did he spend his wedding day in his last life?On that day, he was also called up early in the morning to get dressed. Compared to today, he was even more frowning and worried.Now, he didn't know if this was the second time sitting in front of this dressing table, looking at himself in the mirror dressed in wedding dress with makeup, he felt familiar, and he felt very calm.Others could say that the third prince wouldn't come back, but he believed that Li Mingjin would come back, he was so convinced.They hadn't joined forces to bring down Shen Mingyun, how could he leave this world first.Compared with Luo Shuyu, who was restless and gradually calmed down, Shen Mingyun, who was taking breakfast slowly in Youyou Xiaozhu, was different.At this moment, Shen Mingyun smiled brightly, waiting for the system to give him 200 mall coins.After thinking about it, he decided to go to the door to watch the ceremony. He hadn't seen the ancient wedding process to see how they welcomed their relatives.He was very sure that the third prince wouldn't be the first in the welcoming team. It was a great joy in life to be able to see the fruits of his labor closely.Luo Renshou sent the two eldest sons, Luo Shumo and Luo Shuhan, to send off their relatives. Although they had a estrangement with Luo Shuyu, for the sake of the family, in any case, they were all members of the sending off team.Madam Xi and others were also ready in the courtyard where Luo Shuyu was married, and they were waiting for the royal welcome team.The auspicious time had came.The masters of the Luo family who were waiting in the front hall all had their own thoughts, and Mrs. Luo sat in the first place, waiting for Luo Shuyu to come and gave salute.Shen Mingyun, Luo Shuyaoand others were sitting together, the former was overjoyed, while the latter was uneasy.Luo Shuyao said with a stern face: \"Cousin, if the third prince doesn't appear, the third brother will be really happy this time.\"Shen Mingyun nodded: \"You are right.\" Falling off such a high cliff, didn't know if there was still life to come back to marry the beauty, \"Fate is unpredictable.\"The two were chatting with different thoughts, when they heard someone shouting: \"Master! The third prince's wedding team is here! The third prince's wedding team is here!\"Luo Shuyao stretched his neck and looked out, trying to make sure who was coming to greet. Shen Mingyun, on the other hand, showed indifference that he was very sure that the third prince would never appear, and now he especially wanted to light a cigarette, and happily accepted his task points.When Shen Mingyun was about to follow him out to see what Luo Shuyu was wearing, he suddenly felt a pain in his stomach. He ate too much when he was happy in the morning, so he had to give up the gossip and go to the toilet behind.As soon as the people who welcoming the relatives arrived, the Luo family naturally started to get busy, and Luo Shuhan, who was in charge in the front, led a group of talented people to block the door.Although everyone knows that the third prince was unlikely to appear today, he still needed to do his appearance, and he must also welcome his relatives. After all, it was a royal wedding.Everyone moved to the door excitedly, just to see who was welcoming from the third prince's party today, whether it was the fourth prince or the other descendants of other royal clans, each and everyone was burning with the spirit of gossip.Luo Shuhan and the others were discussing in a low voice who would come up with the question first, and then they saw the groom riding on a horse with a big red flower and a tall head. He was wearing a crimson auspicious costume. Who?, Luo Shuhan had the answer in his heart, but he still didn't dare to recognize it.This is the groom! Not the person who replaced the groom!Luo Shuhan was stunned, wasn't the third prince missing? who is this?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he was leaning on the crutch, he was still full of momentum. He stared at Luo Shuhan who wanted to embarrass him.Luo Shuhan glanced at him again, his hands began to become cold, and he said with a trembling voice: \"Okay, perfect pass! His Royal Highness the third prince really has an extraordinary literary talent!\"It was lively, Qingwang helped Luo Shuyu, who had already put on a red veil, from the room to the hall.Although Luo Shuyu married Li Mingjin for the second time, he still had to be at the mercy of others. There were too many steps and the rules were cumbersome. He was dizzy and wished to go directly to the wedding room, so he could have a good rest. From the beginning, he felt tired.There was no news of Li Mingjin yesterday. He didn't care who came to greet him, and he could only endure it even with a rooster.There were still a lot of ceremonies before getting married. Luo Shuyu had to be tortured before seeing the groom.The people on the groom's side were still blocked at the front, and Luo Shuyu didn't know the news from the front. Qingwang had to follow him all the time and couldn't run around.Grandma Feng and others were waiting by the side.Before going out, he still needed to say goodbye to family. Luo Shuyu said goodbye to Luo Renshou and the old lady. Because Luo Shuyu's mother was not there, many tears in the middle were saved.The front was blocked for less than a moment, and the next person came back and said that the groom was coming in.Luo Shumo squatted down in front of Luo Shuyu: \"Third brother, I'll carry you to the sedan chair.\"In the last life, Luo Shumo also carried him on his back, but since reading the book, Luo Shuyu didn't want to pay attention to him anymore, and he didn't want to be caught in the wedding. He went out behind his back, he didn't want to be too involved with the Luo family.At the time of embarrassment, a crimson figure leaning on the crutch appeared in front of Luo Shuyu, and the person's light brown eyes stared coldly at Luo Shumo, who was half-squatting.Everyone was taken aback by Li Mingjin's sudden appearance. Isn't this prohibition?Luo Shuyu couldn't help but whispered softly: \"Li Mingjin.\" This person appeared in front of him so suddenly.Seeing that he didn't lack any arms or legs, he was relieved, but he didn't know why he was leaning on a crutch, and Luo Shuyu's eyes filled with moisture.Li Mingjin, who was standing in front of him, had a gloomy expression, but his expression softened when he saw Luo Shuyu.\"My people don't need your back.\" Li Mingjin, who disappeared for many days, said to Luo Shumo.He raised his hand, and the guard behind him pulled out a beautiful jujube-colored pony. He stretched out his hand to Luo Shuyu who was standing in front of him, not allowing him to refuse: \"Come here.\"Luo Shuyu looked at him and quickly reaching out his hand, his lips moved, Li Mingjin pulled him closer, and when the two approached, he whispered again: \"Li Mingjin.\"Li Mingjin: \"With me here, don't be afraid.\"\" Don't be afraid.\" He relaxed, and the tears that were about to be held back slammed down.Li Mingjin clenched his hand and said in a voice that only the two of them could hear: \"I'll take you home.\" For some reason, he just wanted to say these words, and he blurted out for no reason. The most incomprehensible thing now was Luo Shuyu's tears. In a few days away, the one he wanted to see most was him.Luo Shuyu: \"Yeah.\"Luo Renshou shook his head in the back, he was not easy to intervene, the domineering and brutality of the third prince was not a matter of a day or two, and even the wedding showed his domineering.Luo Shumo also knew what his father was thinking, so he got up, looked up at Luo Shuyu, and saw that his hand had already been handed over to Li Mingjin, without any hesitation, he seemed to have never seen such a third brother, the compromise was not sooner.Madam Xi didn't dare to make a sound, so she had to laugh. There was nothing she could do if she didn't meet the etiquette. The current third prince was the etiquette.Luo Shuyu was helped by Li Mingjin on the pony, and he was preparing to go out with the pony.A group of people immediately raised smiles on their faces and happily sent Luo Shuyu to the sedan chair.Luo Shuyu rode his pony to the sedan chair at the door, and was about to get down by himself, when Li Mingjin suddenly hugged him off the pony. The sudden movement almost scared Luo Shuyu, but it wasn't because he was hugged, but he worried about his feet.Luo Shuyu reminded him carefully: \"Be careful with your feet.\"Li Mingjin said softly, \"husband can't touch to the ground.\"Luo Shuyu moved his lips, but didn't say anything.The third prince could do what he wanted, and no one else dared to ask or said anything, until Luo Shuyu safely entered the sedan chair, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. The sweat on their face were frightened by the actions of the third prince, and they were afraid that he would go back to the house directly with the new husband, skipping the step of worshipping the hall.Is this the fear of trouble or the urgency of the monkey?Anyway, no one dared to guess that he was in a hurry. Don't die. If the third prince saw blood on the wedding day, it would be very unlucky!Welcoming you smoothly.The welcoming team went directly to the Third Prince\u2019s Mansion from the east of the city, beating gongs and drums all the way, firecrackers blaring, it was so lively!When the wedding party went to the street, it was lively, with childrens clamoring to see the groom and bride, and people on both sides of the street watching.\"Which prince's wedding is this? Why does it feel more grand than the crown\u00a0 prince's wedding a few years ago?\"\"You don't know, today is the third prince's wedding! I have a friend, my cousin's sister-in-law's is a second-class maid in the house of the official of the Ministry of Punishment. She told us that this third prince is married to the son of the Minister of Rites.\"\"I heard that these this third prince is fierce, with three heads and six arms, but I heard that he is normal people during the day. He looks like he will turn into a monster at night, and his right hand will turn into a whip. He is moody. Marrying this delicate Luo Gongzi is almost like giving food. I wonder if he can survive the Mid-Autumn Festival!\"\"Wow ! Shang Shu is also ruthless, how dare he send his own son into the tiger's mouth.\"\"It's His Majesty's imperial decree, who would dare to disobey?\"\" Goosebumps, just think about it, it's terrible! Poor Third Luo gongzi!\"Luo Shuyu in the sedan chair, he supported the heavy headdress.There were firecrackers outside, and he couldn't hear the people's comments. He only felt that his mood was completely different this time.In the past life, he was uncomfortable sitting in the sedan chair like being bitten by ants, but this time, he no longer feared about the future, but yearned for it.Shaking all the way, until the sedan chair stopped.The car curtain was pushed open by a hand, and Luo Shuyu knew that this was Li Mingjin's hand, and the nails on his slender fingers were always cut flat and clean.Luo Shuyu was stunned for a moment, and put his hand on his palm. His palm was wide and warm. Even in summer, it didn't feel hot. He put his hand in Li Mingjin's hand, and he helped him get off the sedan chair.The two looked at each other, and then Luo Shuyu half lowered his head, stared at Li Mingjin's palm, felt the temperature of the palm, and sighed with emotion: Not only did he come back, but he also married Li Mingjin smoothly.Under the veil, Luo Shuyu had a slight smile on his lips, and his eyes were full of amorous feelings, and Li Mingjin almost looked crazy.The author has something to say: one more.Third Prince: My wife's hands are so soft `~ It's perfect.Luo Shuyu: Where did you put my hand?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Li Mingjin patiently followed the process customized by the ministers step by step.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin had to give incense to their ancestors, prayed for the blessing of the gods, and told their ancestors the good news.\"Kneel, kowtow, second kowtow, third kowtow!\"When offering incense, Li Mingjin's legs were inconvenient, but he was able to support himself with the crutch. Luo Shuyu was a little worried that his legs would hurt too much. He just want to know where he had been since he disappeared, whether he suffered, how he was injured, and whether the bandit Jiang Yang who injured him was caught.Thinking of this, Luo Shuyu felt that it didn't matter how complicated the wedding process was. At least he could touch the living Li Mingjin, and he stood in front of him and got married.As the process continued, Li Mingjin felt Luo Shuyu's glowing eyes.The ceremonial official in the hall recited loudly: \"The incenses are misty, the candles are brilliant, the groom and the bridegroom are in the flower hall.\"Luo Shuyu looked up at him and met Li Mingjin's gaze. Today's Li Mingjin was well-dressed in a crimson wedding dress. It made him more heroic. Compared with the black clothes he wore all the year round, he was much brighter today. He was different from the elegant young master in white clothes that day, but he was equally handsome and extraordinary.He only got to know Li Mingjin in the last year of his past life, but when he looked at him now, there was always the appearance of the Li Mingjin that he knew in the latter part of his past life. It was him, this was Li Mingjin, the same Li Mingjin.\"The auspicious time has come.\"\"first worship the heaven and earth!\"\"second worship the high hall!\"\" The husband and wife worship each other, and send them to the bridal chamber!\"Compared with the layout of the Luo family, the Third Prince's Mansion was full of royal style, decorated with lanterns and colorful.All the ministers and guests had arrived and were all watching the ceremony.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin went back to the new room first. There were red curtains in the room, and Li Mingjin could only send Luo Shuyu into the new room.Li Mingjin wanted to stay and see Luo Shuyu more, but it was useless to be impatient. Even if he was too self-sufficient on weekdays, today was his big day. Madam Xi and others had stopped him and dragged him.Madam Xi said bluntly: \"Third prince, you have to go to toast first. This is the etiquette of marriage.\"Li Mingjin snorted coldly and stood at the door for a while before leaving. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.Yes, he has to do the bridal chamber first, so what should we do?The marriage between a man and a ger in Daxia was different from a marriage with a woman. The ger lifted the veil, and the woman removed the veil. After all, the ger looked more like a man, and was different from a woman in all aspects, so the etiquette in marriage was also different.Luo Shuyu sat on the bed, and Madam Xi said some auspicious words before leaving.Li Mingjin was in the banquet outside,\u00a0 he didn't return to the room so quickly for a while, leaving only Qingwang in the room.Luo Shuyu looked at the room where he lived in the previous life, the layout hadn't changed, the furniture was polished, there was joy everywhere, and the words \"double happiness\" were pasted on the curtains and windows.Seeing all this, he felt warm in his heart.In the last life, Li Mingjin seldom slept in the main room. He mostly slept in the study room. The two of them only slept together occasionally for a year later, mainly because he was pregnant at that time and would always get kicked up in the middle of the night by the small things in his stomach. In order to reassure him, Li Mingjin would sleep with him in a room and sleep on the couch.Then he didn't know which day he began to sleep in the bed.Qingwang quietly pushed the door in, and saw Luo Shuyu walking in the house, with nostalgia in his eyes, as if he had been here before.Qingwang brought a bowl of wontons in his hand and said, \"Gongzi, eat something first. This is what His Highness asked the kitchen to cook for you. He said that you haven't eaten for a day, so eat something to cushion your stomach first.\"Luo Shuyu's fingers glancing across the dressing table he used to use there was a bowl of wontons, his heart warmed: \"Got it, let someone prepare some hangover soup, His Highness doesn't know how much wine he will drink outside, and I will give it to him later when he comes back. Next bowl of noodles.\"\"Understood.\" Qingwang would occasionally joke with Luo Shuyu, \"Gongzi, you are already had the demeanor of an imperial concubine just now, and this wedding dress suits you.\"Luo Shuyu smiled, took off the veil. He picked up the spoon and started to eat the wontons. The skin melted in the mouth, soft and fragrant, and added sesame oil, which was not greasy at all. Li Mingjin knew that he always liked light food, and this wonton was just right for his taste.After a tiring day, he ate a bowl of wontons and finally came back to life.Luo Shuyu was drowsy sitting at the table with his chin on the back of his hand. When he almost fell asleep, Qingwang hurried in and shook him: \"Gongzi, gongzi, put on the veil quickly, the third prince comes.\"Luo Shuyu patted his face and woke up. Qingwang put on the veil for him before leaving. Luo Shuyu was the only one left in the room.When he returned to the place where he had lived for five years, he didn't feel uncomfortable at all, but felt at ease.There was a commotion outside, and some people were booing, saying it was going to be a bridal chamber.Luo Shuyu's ears were sharp, and he heard a prince joked about him: \"Third brother, we also want to meet the third sister-in-law, so let's satisfy our curiosity.\"\"Today is my big day, I haven't seen him yet, and now it's not your turn, go back.\"\"Third Highness, you can't do this, you finally get married, and don't let me wait and see!\"Li Mingjin: \"If anyone can't do it, you can't do it.\"Everyone burst out laughing.It was rare for Luo Shuyu to hear him talked so much to people. Obviously, his mood was very high today. In his last life, he only thought about the bridal chamber at night, and he never noticed it. Now it sounded quite interesting. It turned out that this was the legendary bridal chamber trouble.However, Luo Shuyu had no chance to be disturbed by the bridal chamber, and it was quiet for a while outside.The door was gently pushed open, and soft footsteps approached Luo Shuyu. No need to think much to know that all the guests outside who wanted to make trouble for the bridal chamber were chased away by Li Mingjin.Luo Shuyu listened to the sound of leaning on the crutche from the outside, and then stopped again.Why didn't he come in?After waiting for a while, Luo Shuyu found that Li Mingjin still hadn't come in, so he decisively got up and walked outside.Luo Shuyu opened the curtain and saw Li Mingjin leaning against the door with his head lowered. If he saw it correctly, he saw a panic flashed across Li Mingjin's face when he saw him.Luo Shuyu probably understood, thought he was drunk, and asked softly, \"Are you very drunk?\"Li Mingjin stared at his face through the thin veil, thinking, now that the wine wasn't intoxicating, people were self-intoxicating, and he was suddenly a little bit nervous and wanted to relax, but he never thought Luo Shuyu would worry about him.He was stared straight at by Luo Shuyu, and his ears were slightly hot: \"It's okay.\"Luo Shuyu supported him: \"You sit down and drink a cup of sober soup, I will have it ready, and I will ask them to give it to you.\"Li Mingjin was led away by him, smelled the faint fragrance on his body, and suddenly felt a drunken feeling.The candle shadows flickered, and the surroundings were silent.Luo Shuyu helped Li Mingjin to the table, and she sat next to him, and was about to take off the veil on her face, but Li Mingjin held her hand.Li Mingjin stared at him: \"I'm coming.\"The distance between the two suddenly narrowed, surrounded by Li Mingjin's breath, mixed with the aroma of wine, and he seemed to be slightly smoked.Li Mingjin slowly took off his veil, and the two sat, facing each other, their hearts beating wildly.Finally, he saw Luo Shuyu, who was dressed in full makeup today. He was different from everyone else. Compared with the young master who preferred to dress up as a woman, Luo Shuyu could be regarded as relatively heroic and full of clarity. He had a pair of beautiful and agile eyes. It seemed that there were stars in it, and when he smiled, there was a small pear vortex on the corner of his mouth, which was very cute.Today's Luo Shuyu was different from usual. The eyebrows depicted were more slender, but the makeup was not heavy. It just made his facial features more delicate and not tacky.Li Mingjin took off the headdress on his head, put the headdress aside, poured two glasses of wine, and handed it to Luo Shuyu.Luo Shuyu felt that his neck was much more relaxed, and he also knew that Li Mingjin was going to have a drink with him at this time.In the last life, when they drank the wine, they were quite restrained, and they sipped it without tasting it.Thinking about it, it shouldn't happen in this life. The person in front of him was no longer the terrifying stranger he thought, but someone who he could rely on to live and die together.The two of them crossed their arms and raised their heads to drink the low-degree fruit wine, which was sweet.Luo Shuyu put down the wine glass, got up and went to the dressing table to get a pair of scissors and a small box: \"Your Highness, can you let me cut a strand of your hair?.\"Li Mingjin nodded: \"Okay.\"Luo Shuyu first cut off a section of his own hair, then cut off Li Mingjin's, tied the two's hair with a rope, and put them in the box.Luo Shuyu raised a small smile: \"Your Highness, do you know what this means?\"Li Mingjin said succinctly: \"You and I, husband and wife like this hair.\"Luo Shuyu looked at him and said, \"Not only I want to be husband and wife like this hair in this life with Your Highness, I want to think about it in my next life.\"\"Why?\" Li Mingjin asked him, a little surprised.Luo Shuyu lowered his head and didn't answer. He was still a little helpless when he looked straight at him and said something he liked, so let's take it as shy.Li Mingjin wondered if it was a bit redundant to ask. Since they were already married, they were naturally married. They would live a lifetime, and it was understandable to book for the next life.After putting away the box, Luo Shuyu handed the hangover soup to Li Mingjin: \"Your Highness will feel better if you drink it.\"Li Mingjin complied with his words and drank the hangover soup. In fact, he seldom drank hangover soup when he drank. After drinking the hangover soup, it seemed that getting married was not bad. He finally realized how interesting it was for those ministers who had families to talk about \"what's wrong with my wife\".He was a little confused by the words \"husband and wife\", and he didn't notice why Luo Shuyu was so familiar with the bedroom cabinet.Li Mingjin looked at the candlelight and reached out to hold his fair hand: \"Are you tired?\"Luo Shuyu shook his head and asked the question he cared most about: \"I heard that you have suffered outside the past few days, how did your right foot hurt? Is it serious?\"Li Mingjin actually wanted to take a break, but Luo Shuyu didn't play cards according to the routine, so he had to answer the question about his foot injury first.He felt a little guilty, and said with a guilty conscience: \"It's nothing, I just didn't stand properly when I was fighting with people, and it's not in the way.\"Luo Shuyu begged: \"Can I take a look?\"Li Mingjin: \"Okay.\" He pulled up his pant legs and pulled down half of his socks.Luo Shuyu squatted in front of him and stared at his feet: \"It seems to be very swollen, does it hurt?\"Li Mingjin said, \"I'm a martial artist, so this pain is nothing.\"Luo Shuyu: \"I think it's extremely serious. I'll help you to rest on the bed.\"Li Mingjin nodded: \"Okay.\"Luo Shuyu stared at him for a while, and suddenly felt that his feet were swollen like steamed buns and hurt, \"Then let's rest together.\"Luo Shuyu undressed him, He took off his complicated auspicious clothes, and at the same time, he smelled a little sweat on his clothes, and his body was a little itchy. If he hugged Li Mingjin later, he would be disliked, so he asked Li Mingjin: \"Your Highness, why don't we wash up before going to bed?\"Li Mingjin was also sweating today and smelled of alcohol: \"Alright.\" He liked this proposal and could prepare for it.He asked someone to bring water in to wash up. After tossing for a while, Luo Shuyu went to bed first. He yawned and waited for Li Mingjin to come out after washing and grooming. He felt a little nervous in his heart. Although it was not the first time, he was still nervous.Waiting until his eyelids to start fighting.At this time, Li Mingjin was hiding in the compartment and reading a booklet. After making sure that he remembered the steps correctly, he shoved the booklet on the top of the cabinet and limped to their bed.But when he climbed into the bed, he found that Luo Shuyu, who hadn't seen him come out after waiting for a long time, had already fallen asleep with the quilt.Li Mingjin stared at Luo Shuyu's sweet sleeping face, and thought angrily in his heart: Should I regret reading that booklet!The author has something to say:Third Prince: Wife, let me show you a particularly beautiful and unique book, which is rare in the world.Luo Shuyu: ...don't look at it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Luo Shuyu slept inside and he slept outside.Although there was no successful bridal chamber, the two of them slept in the same bed, lay in the same bed, and covered in the same quilt. It was so exciting, and it was something he had longed for a long time.Now that the dream had came true, there was nothing unsatisfactory. If he hadn't been careless and sprained his foot before marriage, maybe tonight would have been more complete.The candle went out. Li Mingjin found Luo Shuyu's hand in the bed and held it tightly. For some reason, his nose felt sour, as if he had wanted to do this for a long time. He thought that he should love Luo Shuyu, otherwise he wouldn't feel this way. He fell in love at first sight.He didn't know if his concubine treated him the same way, or just pretending to be happy for him so he could jump out of the fire pit of the Luo family.Li Mingjin couldn't feel confident in himself, it would be nice if his reputation was better.The hand he was holding was soft and boneless, with well-defined joints, slender and good-looking. Li Mingjin was reluctant to use too much force, fearing that the calluses in his palm would hurt him, so he held it vacantly.He turned to his side, his eyes adjusted to the darkness and he could see the outline of Luo Shuyu's face. Looking at it, it was late at night.Li Mingjin just started to feel sleepy, Luo Shuyu had already married back, and he would see him every day from now on.He was a little excited tonight, but after the excitement, he was exhausted. In addition, he hadn't rested much in the previous two days. When he relaxed, Li Mingjin also fell into a dark and sweet dream fragrance. In the dream, he dreamed that he was completely proficient in all the postures in the booklet, and he married Luo Shuyu.Luo Shuyu was awakened by a strange hard object. He opened his eyes and found himself was wrapped around his waist by a strong arm, with his back against the man's chest.It would be fine if it was just an ordinary hug, but now that Li Mingjin's object was touching him, it made him a little uncomfortable. He knew that it was normal for a man to do this, but he didn't have much of this kind of experience before.He quietly removed Li Mingjin's hand, obviously his actions still woke Li Mingjin.As soon as Li Mingjin opened his eyes, he realized that the two of them were very close. He didn't know when he took Luo Shuyu into his arms, and he felt that his pants were a little sticky at the moment, so he didn't need to think about it to know what was going on!Li Mingjin immediately let go of Luo Shuyu, threw away the thin quilt, and got out of the bed.\"Hey!\"Luo Shuyu sat up and was startled by Li Mingjin's rapid speed, but now he was attracted by his screams: \"What's wrong?\"Li Mingjin pursed his lips and jumped back to the edge of the bed with one leg while enduring the pain, Sitting down: \"I forgot the pain in my foot.\"Luo Shuyu quickly got out of the bed, lifted his trouser, and gently lifted his foot on his knees: \"Your Highness, your foot is more swollen than last night, we have to ask the imperial doctor to come over for diagnosis and treatment, don't let it become the root of disease.\"\"Don't hold my foot, I stepped on the ground, it's dirty.\" It was strange to be held by the imperial concubine.Luo Shuyu chuckled: \"I don't mind.\"Li Mingjin pulled back his leg neatly: \"I'll bear it for a while, it won't get in the way.\"Luo Shuyu immediately changed his face, his face was solemn, and he didn't listen to Li Mingjin.Grandma Feng outside heard something wrong. Why did the imperial\u00a0 concubine called someone to serve His Royal Highness the third prince on the first day of the wedding, not him.Is this the other way around?But no matter what, Grandma Feng asked all the servants to prepare, today they were going to go to the palace to meet His Majesty, the Empress and others.Not long after dawn, Luo Shuyu slept comfortably last night, and woke up earlier than usual today. He asked Grandma Feng, \"Now ask the imperial doctor to come over, will it be in time to go to the palace?\"Grandma Feng was almost frightened by him. The second day of the wedding to ask for a doctor?Luo Shuyu pointed to Li Mingjin's swollen foot that was bigger than a pig's trotter: \"His Royal Highness's foot hurts so badly, you have to take a look, you can't lst it become the root cause of the other disease.\"Li Mingjin said: \"Just do as the imperial concubine said, lest he worry. When I go to the palace later, I will explain it to the father and the queen.\"Grandma Feng: \"Yes.\"Qingwang continued to study with Grandma Feng, and with Li Mingjin around, he didn't dare to say more, just do whatever he wanted.While waiting for the imperial doctor, Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin settled for breakfast first.When the imperial doctor on duty heard that the third prince invited him, he rushed over immediately. On the way, the imperial doctor thought about the reason for inviting him over, for example, the third prince tossed the new imperial concubine so badly last night.After arriving at the Third Prince's Mansion, he found out that it was not the new imperial concubine who had just entered the door yesterday, but the third prince himself, who was very different from his thoughts.The person who came up to talk to him was actually the new imperial concubine who was in good condition: \"The imperial doctor, please look at His Highness' feet.\"The imperial doctor was a little surprised: \"Yes, the humble one will be give diagnosis and treatment to His Royal Highness the third prince immediately.\"Li Mingjin said, \"The imperial concubine is making a fuss, you can just look at it.\"Luo Shuyu said: \"Don't listen to him, no matter how young you are, you can't waste it like this.\"The imperial doctor thought to himself that the new imperial concubine was trying to pull out the tiger's beard? Really young and ignorant, do you not know the reputation of the third prince?However, Li Mingjin's next words shocked the imperial doctor again.Li Mingjin said with a sullen face: \"Then you can do as the imperial concubine said.\"The imperial doctor: \"...Yes.\" His face really hurt.The imperial doctor dutifully examined Li Mingjin's foot. \"The injury was not serious at first, but since it didn't get treatment for in a timely manner, and the swelling and pain had been exacerbated. Don't do strenuous exercise, don't eat spicy and greasy things.\".Li Mingjin turned to Luo Shuyu. From the imperial doctor's point of view, Li Mingjin was staring at the new imperial concubine, and seemed to really dislike him for doing so.But in Luo Shuyu's eyes, Li Mingjin should feel a little wronged? There should be no mistake.After sending the imperial doctor away, Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin were about to enter the palace to meet the queen dowager, the emperor and the queen.Although the imperial doctor instructed Li Mingjin not to do strenuous exercise recently, this ceremony couldn't be abandoned today.On the way to the palace, Li Mingjin wanted to ride a horse, but was called into the carriage by Luo Shuyu.He said: \"His Royal Highness, you have been injured for a few days, and your feet are inconvenient. Why don't you ride a carriage with me, and then ride a horse after the swelling subsides ?\".Li Mingjin, who was being controlled for the first time, felt quite fresh. When he was sitting in the carriage, he would occasionally look at Luo Shuyu who was sitting opposite him. Today, he returned to the simple dress of the past, and he added an extra hairpin, looked fresh and not tacky, quiet nice.Luo Shuyu seemed very quiet at the moment, Li Mingjin thought he was at a loss because he wanted to see the father and the queen, so he was too nervous to speak.Li Mingjin said, \"Don't be nervous, they won't embarrass you when I'm here.\"Luo Shuyu shook his head, \"I'm not nervous.\" It was just a matter of repeating what he did in his previous life.\"Yeah.\" The imperial concubine was duplicitous, but he couldn't reveal it either. He wanted to give him face, so he was kind of cute.Luo Shuyu didn't know what Li Mingjin was thinking, so he pretended to be ignorant and asked, \"Then we want to see everyone today?\" There are the eldest brother, the crown prince and others who may be waiting at the queen dowager's place, and you will know each other by then.\"Luo Shuyu nodded: \"Okay.\"He had seen all of them, but he never talked in depth or made friendship.Looking back on his previous life, he was like a person from a Taoyuan isolated from the world. The content of the battle in the harem was not only the harem of Emperor Tiansheng, but also the families of the princes, all of whom were masters of palace fighting. However, when these people met Shen Mingyun, they would be treated miserably.For example, when Shen Mingyun married the fourth prince, even his status was not worthy of being an imperial concubine, the fourth prince eventually married him. Shen Mingyun in the palace felt various discomforts, and he was unwilling to adapt. He went back directly. If he suffered a loss on the spot, he would definitely find the opponent's handle afterwards and brought the opponent to ruin. He also had the reputation of acting for the heavens and eliminating the harm for people.However, because Shen Mingyun used the system to tinker with many new things, Emperor Tiansheng gave him a lot of face, and even the crown prince was very interested in him, and he even thought of taking him as a side concubine before he became the fourth prince imperial concubine.After thinking about it, it seemed that the first four adult princes in the royal family all had different depths of intersection with Shen Mingyun. Only Li Mingjin had the least contact with him, but he also disappeared the fastest in the book.The carriage arrived at the palace gate.Emperor Tiansheng knew that Li Mingjin finally came, and his foot was injured, so he specially prepared a sedan chair for them, and carried them directly to the Queen dowager's Cixin Palace.As soon as the two got off the sedan chair, they saw someone coming in the front, Luo Shuyu holding Li Mingjin's arm.Before the person came to the front, the voice came first: \"Third brother, this is the third sister-in-law, right?\"Luo Shuyu raised his head, this person was wearing white clothes, holding a folding fan. The other side looked harmless to humans and animals and looked like a dog, never taking extra precautions.The person who came was the fourth prince, Shen Mingyun's good match in the future, and the person who would conquer the world in the future.In front of outsiders, Li Mingjin returned to his gloomy appearance: \"Well, your third sister-in-law.\"The fourth prince politely said: \"Third sister-in-law.\"Luo Shuyu stood beside him and saluted to the fourth prince, Li Mingrui. \"I have seen the fourth prince.\"Li Mingjin said to Luo Shuyu, \"Let's go in.\" He didn't really want Luo Shuyu to talk to the fourth brother.The fourth prince was not married yet, so he paid attention to etiquette and it was inconvenient to tell Luo Shuyu. The three of them entered the Queen Dowager's Cixin Palace together.Luo Shuyu couldn't help but thought, without the help of Shen Mingyun, would the fourth prince still be in that position?If his and Li Mingjin's lives would be affected by these people, why not influenced these people in turn?Li Mingjin noticed that Luo Shuyu seemed to be in a bad mood. There was a smile on his lips on the way here, now he put away the smile, and he was still a little serious. Worried about him, he took the initiative to shake his hand.Luo Shuyu looked up at him, his heart gradually warmed.Li Mingjin thought to himself that his wife was really duplicitous, and it would be a lie to say that he was not nervous.At the same time, Luo Mansion.When he woke up, Shen Mingyun, who saw the words \"Mission Failed\" again, almost jumped up in anger. Shen Mingyun said angrily: \"System, what's going on? Why can't I complete a task related to Luo Shuyu every time I encounter it? Does he have any grudge against me?\"System: \"Host, please make a persistent efforts.\"Was Luo Shuyu a transmigrator? He had never failed a mission before.When he was bored, the system released a new task, and his attention was immediately attracted.[Please start the \"Huakui 101\" event as soon as possible to earn the first pot of gold, and you will be rewarded with 2000 mall coins for completing the task. \u3011The author has something to say:The third prince: Careful wife, have you noticed where I'm getting thicker?Luo Shuyu:\u00a0 \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were also the princes and princesses who came to watch the new couple of the third prince. They didn't want to join in the fun, but the third prince was different after all. He had always acted boldly, and always had a bad reputation. No one dared to bully him in the palace. Like his mother, she had a bad personality and difficult to get along with.The Cixin Palace was really lively today, and everyone who should come had came.The queen dowager was already a little old, but she was still full of energy and well maintained, and it was impossible to tell her real age.The current queen dowager wasn't the biological mother of The Emperor Tiansheng. Mentioned the late Emperor was another confusing and complicated account.Speaking of this,\u00a0 the current queen, she was the queen dowager's niece, which was why The Emperor Tiansheng was not close to the queen, but rather favored Concubine Lin who had been with him from the Prince's Mansion to the throne.The factions in the court were naturally closely related to the harem. Now the concubines of the harem had already stood in line, let alone the court.It was just that the Crown Prince's faction and the First Prince's faction were evenly matched, and no one knew who would have the last laugh.Now, only Luo Shuyu knew the ending of the book, the snipe and mussel fight, the fisherman won, and let's see the future.The queen dowager heard in the morning that Li Mingjin had asked an imperial doctor to see his legs this morning. Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin were arranged to sit down as soon as they arrived.The eldest prince and the crown prince went to the Cixin Palace at the same time. The two of them were peaceful on the surface, but inside and outside the words, there were all kinds of competition between you and me, \"I won't let you, and you won't let me\", even if they said the auspicious words to the queen dowager, they had to compete with each other whose words were more auspicious, and more comfortable for others to listen to.The queen dowager didn't seem to see the dark waves between them, and smiled and accepted their auspicious words. In the end, The Cixin Palace was closer to the crown prince.Today, neither the eldest prince nor the crown prince were the protagonists. Immediately, The Emperor Tiansheng and the queen also arrived, and the next step was the process of the newlyweds serving tea.The two first offered tea to the queen dowager, the queen dowager drank it, and gave them a pair of precious jade pendants.The Emperor Tiansheng thought that Li Mingjin was injured due to official duties, so he didn't need to kneel and kowtow, but directly drank the tea they respected. He also gave them a lot of auspicious words with good morals, and he was not stingy at all.Seeing that the queen dowager and Emperor Tiansheng gave the third prince a lot of respect, the queen was also very generous in her actions, and gave a pair of jade dragon and phoenix pendants.Luo Shuyu had met the elders, the crown prince and the crown princess, the eldest prince and the eldest princess and concubine. All of them greeted each other. Luo Shuyu thanked them one by one, and stood beside Li Mingjin.The Emperor Tiansheng and the queen had a good impression of Luo Shuyu, so the queen asked him to sit down and told everyone about the turbulence in the marriage. The queen smiled and said: \"God bless Mingjin can come back safely. At that time, Your Majesty and I almost canceled the marriage for you, but Shuyu said that he would marry you in life or death, and I was moved. \"The queen dowager liked to hear this kind of thing that was the same as a scripture when she was old: \"How come I don't know about this, how did Mingjin's leg hurt?\"She was praying to the Buddha a few days ago, and she naturally didn't need it to participate in and knew less about the third prince's wedding.The Emperor Tiansheng said: \"Don't worry the queen dowager, Mingjin went to chase the thief and almost didn't come back to marry him. Fortunately, he was so proud of himself that he didn't get hurt.\"\"When preparing for the marriage, why did you let him go ahead and did dangerous things, fortunately, the ancestors blessed and the child returned safely.\"The Emperor Tiansheng said: \"It's also an exercise, Mingjin, you say so?.\"Li Mingjin said truthfully: \"Well, it's just the leg injury.\" Resolutely didn't let others knew that his leg had nothing to do with this \"disappearance\".The royal family chat was different from that of ordinary people. Fortunately, after Luo Shuyu's baptism in the last life, he no longer knew nothing as he did when he first entered.The queen dowager changed the topic and looked at Luo Shuyu: \"Shuyu is also good, come to the palace to talk to me more in the future.\"Luo Shuyu got up and saluted: \"Yes, as long as the queen dowager is willing, the grandson is willing to tell you interesting things.\"The queen dowager smiled and said: \" He really knows how to speak, and he deserves to be a scholar of the Ministry of Rites.\"When it came to Luo Renshou, Luo Shuyu felt less comfortable in his heart, but with a kind smile on his face, he even thanked the queen dowager for her praise.The second time he greeted these people, Luo Shuyu's mentality was also different. This time he noticed many details that he had never felt before.According to rumors, The Emperor Tiansheng and the queen respected each other like a guest, and the queen dowager often intended to protect the queen.The relationship between the crown prince and the crown princess was okay, and the two occasionally met each other's eyes.On the contrary, the eldest prince brought the eldest princess concubine and the side concubine. It was right when the third prince brought his new wife here, it had nothing to do with the eldest prince's side concubine, but she was here, and today's dress was even more than the eldest princess concubine. She was charming and flirted with the eldest prince during this period. Didn\u2019t know if she thought she was the eldest princess concubine, and she was deeply in love with the eldest prince and his wife. It could be seen that the eldest prince and the eldest princess concubine didn't live well in the first prince\u2019s mansionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Li Mingjin's mother was indeed from Fanbang, but it was not like people outside guessed. She ate raw meat, drank raw blood, and had a hot temper. In the harem of The Emperor Tiansheng, her identity was special, and she didn't have much affection with The Emperor Tiansheng. She lived in the palace all the year round, and her relationship with Li Mingjin was even more general, and her health seemed to be not very good all the time. After he married Li Mingjin for four years, Luo Shuyu only had this impression for her.He didn't know whether Li Mingjin had deep feelings for his mother concubine, but he only knew that after she left, Li Mingjin locked himself in the study for two days without eating or drinking, and then went out to get drunk, and then dragged Luo Shuyu to bed with him.Everyone went to different direction. Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin went to the palace behind.Li Mingjin's mother lived in Changle Palace, which was still some distance away from the queen dowager's Cixin Palace.When the two arrived, the maids of Changle Palace were already waiting at the door, and the two went in directly to see Concubine Mei.Different from other palaces, other palaces grew flowers and plants, only Concubine Mei grew some vegetable and crops here.Luo Shuyu helped Li Mingjin went in.Concubine Mei was a somewhat aloof woman. She was taller than ordinary women. She was not an enthusiastic person. She had no smile on her face all the year round. Even when she met the newlyweds Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin coming in, there was no smile on her face.\"You two don't have to salute. Mingjin's legs are inconvenient, so just sit down.\"Li Mingjin sat down directly, and pulled Luo Shuyu to sit next to him: \"This is the mother concubine.\"Luo Shuyu shouted: \"Mother concubine.\"Concubine Mei after answering, she spoke succinctly: \"It's almost noon, you two should have dinner here.\"Li Mingjin said boldly: \"Well, Shuyu had been standing over there and saluted, and I'm tired.\"Luo Shuyu: Thanks to Li Mingjin's injured foot, they didn't salute much just now, it's really a blessing and a curse.Compared to facing The Emperor Tiansheng and others, Li Mingjin's words in front of Concubine Mei obviously took a long time.Concubine Mei said to Luo Shuyu: \"You have to get along and take care of him in the future.\"Luo Shuyu said, \"I will.\"Concubine Mei was satisfied with his answer and nodded: \"I have some medicinal herbs here, you will bring it back when you leave later.\"Luo Shuyu had just entered the door, and it was inconvenient to say too much, and he would answer whatever Concubine Mei said.Soon, lunch was served, and there were several dishes specially given to them by The Emperor Tiansheng, who knew that they had lunch here.After lunch, Concubine Mei also had to rest. Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu left the palace with a sack of medicinal herbs given by Concubine Mei and of course, all the new weddings gifts they got today.Sitting on the carriage returning to the residence, Luo Shuyu asked Li Mingjin, \"Why does mother concubine grow vegetables in the palace?\" He was very curious in his previous life, but he never asked.Li Mingjin straightened his legs, met the eyes of his imperial concubine's unknown desire, and said, \"She likes to eat the vegetables she grows herself.\". Finding that Luo Shuyu didn't quite understand, he added, \"She told me when she was young, the year she was pregnant with me, she was poisoned in the vegetables and almost had a miscarriage. After that, she started to grow vegetables by herself, just in case.\"Luo Shuyu said with emotion: \"The harem is really complicated.\"Li Mingjin: \"Well, You don't need to worried about this in the future.Luo Shuyu nodded: \"What about mother concubine?\"Li Mingjin: \"Don't worry.\"Luo Shuyu thought that he would pay more attention in the future. Maybe he didn't talk to Li Mingjin in his previous life, so he felt that he had less relationship with Concubine Mei. But it didn't seem to be the case now. They just didn't get close. They were mother and son, so how could they don't have feelings.He looked at Li Mingjin's straight legs in the carriage: \"Then worry about your legs first. The imperial doctor said that you should take good care of them. Your Highness won't go out in the next few days.\"The feeling of being controlled by his imperial concubine.Luo Shuyu wanted to talk to him more, but when the carriage drove to the street, they heard someone shouting.\"Big news! Big news! Big news!\"\"Huakui 101 will open in three days!\"\"Huakui 101 will open in three days!\"\"Huakui 101 will open in three days!\"Luo Shuyu opened the curtain of the carriage, and every 50 meters on the street, someone was handing out the flyers from Shen Mingyun.Li Mingjin remembered that Luo Shuyu had mentioned the Huancai Pavilion, and said, \"This Huakui 101 seems to be from your cousin.\"Luo Shuyu said: \"Yes, he has a lot of ideas.\"Li Mingjin asked him: \"Why don't you want Huakui 101 to continue to be held?\"Luo Shuyu asked back, \"Has your Highness heard about the way Huakui 101 is held?\"Li Mingjin had never seen the crazy voting scene of Huakui 101, but Luo Shuyu had seen it in his previous life. Yes, those spectators voted for the Huakui like crazy, the scene was quite scary.Li Mingjin: \"It seems to be a vote?\"Luo Shuyu: \"Then have you calculated how long it will take for this event from the start to the final result, and how many votes will be generated during the period? You know that these votes are calculated in silver, and the number of votes each person casts. Although there is an upper limit, the tickets are not cheap. Let me give an example, a private school teacher earns twelve taels a year, which is considered a wealthy family among the common people. Most families only have a few taels a year, do you know how much Huakui 101 fare is?\"Li Mingjin naturally didn't do such a calculation, he never cared about money: \"What about the fare?\"Luo Shuyu: \"One hundred wen, each person's maximum number of votes for the same Huakui in a game is ten, and there are a total of 101 contestants, can your Highness count it clearly?\"Li Mingjin responded very quickly: \"Ten votes are one tael of silver, if the Huakui you like is ten, that's 10 taels, Private School teacher's annual income.\"Luo Shuyu: \"It's estimated that Huakui 101 will hold about 10 games, and there will be a total of 101. Although there will be fewer people in the later stage, they will stay in the end. There are as many as 20 or 30 people, and this account is a lot.\"Li Mingjin: \"If it's an ordinary family, it will be expensive, and at worst it will go bankrupt and sell children.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Yes.\"After Li Mingjin listened to Luo Shuyu's words, this would inevitably affect the stability of the capital. Everyone wouldn't work, just thinking about voting and chasing the Huakui, wouldn't it be a complete mess.A word that awakened the dreamer, it seemed to be just a simple entertainment, but it was simply huge profit, and it had to be managed.Li Mingjin was not only woke up, but also thought about whether Luo Shuyu would keep the money in his hands in the future. He turned to his legs, which were wrapped like a big pig's trotter, and said solemnly, \"Yu'er, save some silver taels in the future, just give me enough for attending banquet.\"Luo Shuyu: \"...\" That was not what he meant when he said this!The author has something to say: Third The Third Prince: Wife, I have no money, can I make a billion-dollar deal with you tonight?Luo Shuyu: ...Go awayPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone in the capital already knew its opening time and opening mode. The rules that Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin mentioned were all known to him in his previous life. Of course, Li Mingjin would suspect that Shen Mingyun had already written down the process and handed it over to the organizer, while Luo Shuyu had been sending someone to keep an eye on Shen Mingyun.On the first day of the wedding, the whole morning was spent in the meeting, and he returned to the mansion in the afternoon. Li Mingjin wanted to take Luo Shuyu to go shopping, but considering that his leg was swollen more than pig's trotters, you could only choose to give up.Not only he couldn't go shopping with his imperial concubine, he couldn't even get to know the prince's mansion with Luo Shuyu. When he saw Luo Shuyu's nervous eyes on his feet, his heart was sour and warm, and he was extremely regretful about the sprained foot, and even more depressing, Couldn't tell the truth yet.After returning to the mansion, Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu went back to their room to change into comfortable clothes. At this time, Luo Shuyu was changing clothes behind the screen, while Li Mingjin was sitting outside, his eyes swept to the silhouette on the screen from time to time.A ger was different from a woman, a woman could have a good figure that could cause a man's blood to surge. On the other hand, the gers were different. Their bodies were the same as men in appearance. They didn\u2019t have two more lumps of flesh on their chests like women. Their skeletons were smaller than men\u2019s. In this world, most men like women, and they were more willing to choose women than flat boys.When Luo Shuyu came out, he found that Li Mingjin turned his head away, looked at the cup, the teapot, and the chair, but not at him, so he couldn't help worrying: \"Your Highness, do your leg still hurt? Do you want to ask the imperial doctor to come and take a look?\"\"I applied the medicine in the morning. It doesn't hurt much when you touch it.\" He tugged at his robe and asked someone to bring him a crutch, \"I'll go to the study first to deal with something, and I'll come to accompany you for dinner at night.\"\"Okay.\" Luo Shuyu actually had something to ask, but he wasn't in hurry. \"If it's hot, ask someone to add two more basins of ice.\"Luo Shuyu didn't understand why he suddenly had to handle official business, but he said yes.Grandma Feng was an old woman in the mansion, and she was trusted by Li Mingjin. Most of the staff in the main courtyard were arranged by her.The boxes that were carried yesterday were all placed in the side hall. Before the sun went down, Luo Shuyu ordered her to sort out the boxes with him.The people Luo Shuyu brought from Luo Mansion were all arranged by Grandma Feng to learn the rules. The only person he could use now was Qingwang, and others still needed to be trained for a while.Grandma Feng brought four maids, two of them were relatively good-looking, and both of them were relatively mediocre. They were still the same four maids from the previous life, namely Chuncao, Xiayu, Qiuju, and Dongxue.Don't look at them as maids, but Luo Shuyu knew that none of them were simple, and he suspected that among them were bribed by other princes.Back then, he remembered that when the accident happened, he hoped that someone would send the child to a safe place, but before he could send the child out, officers and soldiers came to arrest him. At that time, only Qingwang and the four maids came forward to protect him. There were two people who were scared and hid behind, and the other two who had a tacit understanding didn't show up. As for where they went later, Luo Shuyu didn't know.These four maids must have a lot of background, and it was not simple, and they hadn't been discovered in the Third Prince's Mansion all these years.If he hadn't been reborn, he probably wouldn't have doubted whether there was someone behind them.The four of them stood in front of Luo Shuyu, but Luo Shuyu didn't ask them questions like their origin, age, name, etc. as kindly as in his previous life. He slowly drank the new tea brought by the steward. The taste was excellent and the aftertaste was endless.\"Qingwang, you send someone to ask your Highness if he had drunk this new tea, and ask the steward to send it to the study, and tell him that I say it's delicious.\"\"Yes.\" Qingwang noted the appearance of the four maids. It made him nervous for no reason, the young master would continue to value himself in the future.Qing Wang's worries were not superfluous. The four maids didn't look sideways. They were obviously well-trained.Grandma Feng also sent someone to Luo Shuyu according to the third prince's order, but now the third imperial concubine didn't take them happily, and she didn't know what happened. Are you dissatisfied with these maids?However, thinking that the third imperial concubine had his own decision, Grandma Feng didn't care too much, and stood by and waited.Who knew whether Luo Shuyu's behavior was the jealousy from the ger, after all, two of them were the best among women.Luo Shuyu blew the tea in a leisurely manner and asked, \"Tell me where is your ancestral home, and why did you enter the palace as a slave.\"The first answer was Xiayu, a beautiful girl with a pair of beautiful single eyelid phoenix eyes \"The third imperial concubine, the slave is from Shanxi. When I was five years old, my hometown suffered from famine. In order to support our brothers and sisters, my father went to the capital to do small business. When I was six years old, because there were many sisters in my family, I signed up to be a maid in the palace.\"Luo Shuyu nodded without comment, and took another sip of tea. Xiayu's answer was similar in his previous life, but in his previous life, he didn't care about their origins, and just listened to them casually when they spoke. He didn't think much about it, but now he wrote down their answers one by one.The maids who came out of the palace were all recorded on the record. To trace the source, you could only check their ancestral origin. Secondly, you could also look at the age. The younger you entered the palace, the smaller the suspicion. The longer you had been taught, the more familiar you were with court etiquette, and the more difficult it would be to pick out the problems. It was difficult to find these spies, but it wasn't impossible.Next, Chuncao, Qiuju, and Dongxue also explained their origins. Luo Shuyu finally kept them under his nose and monitored them. He just wanted to know who betrayed the three of them back then. The maid of the prince's palace.Who is it?The four of them were newly arranged by Grandma Feng to serve them personally. Luo Shuyu, on the grounds that he wasn't used to letting women get close to him, asked them to do some sweeping, moving, and lifting, at least in his opinion, it was the most suitable arrangement for now.Grandma Feng didn't say anything in the end. Now the backyard of the Third Prince's Mansion was under the control of the imperial concubine. Except for the third prince, he had the most right to speakPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had lived here for five years. Luo Shuyu was familiar with every corner. He could tell which items were placed where. None of them dared to neglect, everyone was in a panic state, and the imperial concubine was so shrewd that he could see what was wrong at a glance.In less than half a day, the servants in the Prince's Mansion, from the steward down to the sweeper, knew that the new imperial concubine was very powerful.In the study, Li Mingjin received the new tea sent by Luo Shuyu, and he immediately drank it. Luo Shuyu also brought him some snacks. He ate it very happily, and the Ansan around him were very envious.After Luo Shuyu married into the Third Prince's Mansion, Ansan also followed him back to the mansion, and the job of staring at Shen Mingyun was handed over to Anjiu and Anshi.\"Master, this time you almost fell off the cliff, do you need this subordinate to keep watching the entire Luo Mansion? It was too weird at the time. When those people got to the edge of the cliff, they said they would disappear and then disappear, so why did Shen Mingyun want to talk to Luo Shumo and cooperated in every possible way to obstruct your wedding with the imperial concubine?\"Li Mingjin picked up a piece of cake: \"Continue to stare, I was staring at Shen Mingyun according to Yu'er's intention, but I didn't expect Luo Shumo to be not a fuel-efficient lamp, those people,\u00a0 Where did they come from, and how did they disappear? I believe this is not just the handwriting of Luo Shumo. Who know what if Jiangyang bandit is hidden in the capital, and don't know whether they can eat it or not, after finding out their whereabouts , \"send\" it to the crown prince.\"Didn't the crown prince want to compare himself with the eldest prince? This was the best time.Li Mingjin thought about the blueprint: \"What did the crown prince do today?\"Ansan: \"The crown prince submitted the blueprint to His Majesty, His Majesty was delighted to urge the crown prince to follow up on this matter.\"Li Mingjin: \"Isn't eldest brother's\u00a0 bamboo basket is empty (get nothing)?.\"Ansan: \"The first prince hasn't taken out the blueprint before, and the experiment was also quietly tinkering with Luo Shumo and Shen Mingyun at the Luo family's farm, and he has no way to prove that the crown prince stole it from him. It's said that the eldest prince almost got into a fight with the crown prince at the end of the morning court today.\"Li Mingjin said, \"No wonder they were more tit-for-tat than before when the queen dowager was there. It seems that the crown prince couldn't wait to take his credit.\"Ansan thought, It was not your idea?. If the crown prince wasn't so urgent, he would definitely find that there was a lot of suspicious matter in it, but the third prince was wise, and he took advantage of the crown prince's anxious mentality to successfully interfere with it and and\u00a0 fuel to the bad relationship between the crown prince and the eldest prince.Ansan: \"Then let's continue to add fire to the eldest prince?\"Li Mingjin: \"It's all about him in the first place, so it can't be considered to add fire to him. Without his consent, those Jiangyang bandits dared to show up in the capital? Someone must be protecting them. Now Luo Shumo is working under him, and he needed to pay Shen Mingyun back. If you come up with an idea, this matter can't be left like this.\"Ansan: \"What about Luo Shumo and Shen Mingyun?\"Li Mingjin: \"Luo Shumo, what can you see?\"Ansan: \"If the subordinate isn't wrong, he is interested in Shen Mingyun.\"Li Mingjin: \"This Shen Mingyun is really a bit of weird, no wonder Yu'er pays so much attention to him, he knows a lot of people, it seems that he not only has contact with the eldest prince, but also the fourth brother. I 'm quite curious.\"Ansan: \"The fourth prince seems to have plans to escort him in Huakui 101.\"Li Mingjin: \"Think of a reason to cancel this Huakui competition, it's best to make trouble until you can no longer use the brothel to make trouble.\"Ansan: \"This subordinate has a way, I don't know if it's feasible.\"Li Mingjin: \"Let's hear it.\"After discussing some matters with Ansan, when it was time to ignite the lamp, Li Mingjin resolutely went to the main courtyard with a crutch, the imperial concubine is more important.But when Li Mingjin came to the main courtyard, he found that there was only one table of vegetarian dishes on the table. He stared carefully for a while, and after confirming that there was no meat at all, he looked at Luo Shuyu who was sitting in confusion: \"We will eat vegetarian dishes tonight, no meat?\"Luo Shuyu gave him a shallow smile and said ruthlessly, \"No.\"Li Mingjin's expressionless face was even more expressionless.Marrying a wife had to be controlled. Li Mingjin was half happy and half worried. He was happy that someone was taking care of him, but he was worried that the two ate together on the first day of marriage, but there was no meat.Li Mingjin had no choice but to pick up his rice bowl and preparedto eat vegetarian dishes. Luo Shuyu burst out laughing: \"Bring the remaining three meat dishes.\"Luo Shuyu picked up his chopsticks and said, \"The imperial doctor only said that you can't eat spicy food, but he didn't say you can't eat meat.\"Li Mingjin's face became hot, and he coughed, \"...cough.\" He was deceived by his wife.The two were eating when there was a loud noise from outside. Luo Shuyu asked Qingwang to go out to see what was going on, so as not to affect him and Li Mingjin's meal.Qingwang went out for a trip and came back, and said with some embarrassment: \"Master, it's a few women who live in a side courtyard. They said they are here to greet you.\"Luo Shuyu turned to Li Mingjin, who had just stuffed a piece of braised pork into his mouth: \"His Royal Highness?\"Li Mingjin swallowed the meat: \"...\" If I said I don't remember them, do you believe it?The author has something to say:The third Prince: Wife, I always kept myself clean.

You didn't say how to deal with them at the time.\"Two months ago, Emperor Tiansheng hadn't suggested marriage to Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin, and he didn't care when the First prince put people in his mansion, and he didn't even think about it after that, and he kept this matter until today.Li Mingjin said in a deep voice, \"Why didn't you bother me before, but now you run back here to disturb the imperial concubine, check it out for me. If you can't find out, I' ll have to ask you.\"Steward Sun: \"Yes, I'll do it right away.\"He looked at Luo Shuyu and waved: \"If you find out, don't leave any of them, and send them out of the mansion, wherever you come from.\"Steward Sun wiped the sweat from his forehead: \"Yes!\"Steward Sun immediately ran out and sent someone to take a few away and disappeared from the Prince's Mansion without even saying a word. They probably thought that they would greet the imperial concubine, and they would have a position in the third prince's mansion in the future. Who knew that the third prince suddenly disrupted their plans.After the arrangement was finished, Li Mingjin coughed and explained to Luo Shuyu, \"It was sent by my eldest brother. I really don't remember it, so I didn't pay attention.\"Luo Shuyu married Li Mingjin at the end of twelfth month in his past life. These women, Li Mingjin, who came here at the time, had already sent them out of the mansion in advance, and this wedding was held relatively hastily, so he couldn't remember this matter, and it seemed that there was nothing to pursue.He didn't mean to care about Li Mingjin, but he was a little disgusted with the first prince. He was too lenient, and blatantly pushed people into other princes' houses. Sima Zhao's heart was well known.[Sima Zhao's intentions are obvious to everyone (idiom) fig. an open secret]Although there were few more episodes during dinner, this didn't affect Luo Shuyu's mood.Li Mingjin breathed a sigh of relief in the end, and the two of them had a smooth dinner and lived in peace.There were very few activities at night, and it was pitch-black everywhere. If you wanted to walk at night, you had to use lanterns.Li Mingjin originally wanted to go to the study after dinner, but Luo Shuyu stopped him: \"Your Highness, your legs are inconvenient, and it's troublesome to toss back and forth. What if the leg injury is aggravated?\"Luo Shuyu's voice was not loud, but his words were clear. The distance was also close, Li Mingjin listened and ears were itchy, which could suppress the restlessness in his heart, he finally slowed down and didn't go to the study room.There was originally a study room in the main courtyard, but Li Mingjin moved to the courtyard near the Shuixie building to work in the summer. There was also a lotus pond there, and it was cool in the summer, so the study room in the main courtyard was basically not used much. Now that his legs were really inconvenient, he wouldn't go. Li Mingjin: \"It's done, the important things have been handled.\"After a day, he was actually quite tired. Luo Shuyu didn't take a nap today, and was busy with various things. Compared with other prince's mansion, the staff of the third prince's mansion was relatively simple. There were no other women and gers around Li Mingjin, and there was no complicated backyard. Luo Shuyu was glad that he met Li Mingjin, not other prince or Huahuachangzi like many men. After resting for a while after dinner, Luo Shuyu sent water to wash and comb. He didn't wash his hair because it was too late yesterday. After washing his hair tonight, he sat in the yard and waited for the wind to dry his hair.Just when he was washing and grooming, Li Mingjin asked people to clean up the study in the southwest corner of the main courtyard. That position happened facing the courtyard, and there were potted plants in the middle. He took advantage of the situation and asked the servants to remove them.Luo Shuyu was enjoying the cool air in the yard. He was drying his hair, and had a pair of chess pieces by his hand. He held his chin to study the chessboard.Li Mingjin, who came with the crutches, came over and sat beside him, gave the crutches to others, and took over Qingwang's place to wipe his hair.Luo Shuyu's hair wasn't too hard, and it wasn't too soft. It had a faint mint smell just after washing it. Li Mingjin held it in the palm of his hand and wiped it for him a little bit. The hand accidentally touched Luo Shuyu's ear. Relatively thin, Li Mingjin stared at it and couldn't help but want to lean forward and took a bite.Luo Shuyu was immersed in thinking about chess for a while and didn't notice the change beside him, until Li Mingjin accidentally pulled his scalp with a heavy hand, and he raised his head: \"His Royal Highness?\"Li Mingjin stopped the movement in his hand and thought of something, he asked with a taut face: \"I hurt you?\"Luo Shuyu shook his head: \"No, why did you wipe my hair, Qingwang?\" Turning around, he found that Qingwang was already standing far away.He was just a little surprised.After the two of them got married in the past life, there was very little they could say. He avoided Li Mingjin on purpose, and he didn't know if Li Mingjin saw his attitude, so he stopped approaching, not even talking, let alone having physical contact. He tried hard to recall that when he first got married, Li Mingjin seemed to always appear in front of him. He didn't know from which day he gradually became estranged from Luo Shuyu. Later, he often didn't see each other for ten days and a half months, only on various festivals. Only then they would bring them out of the mansion, pretending to be in harmony with each other.Li Mingjin: \"Dry it soon, rest early tonight, the night is cool, don't get sick.\"Luo Shuyu's hair was almost dry. The Mid-Autumn Festival was approaching, and the night started to get a little cold.\"Yeah.\" His hair was dry anyway. It was better to rest early, there was a lot of things to do tomorrow.There were still red candles in the bedroom, and the sheets and quilts were all festive red. Luo Shuyu took off his outer clothes and went to bed first.Li Mingjin went to bed later, he didn't dawdle in the bathroom like last night.Li Mingjin, who had just finished bathing, still had some moisture on his body. Luo Shuyu went to bed early last night. When he woke up, he found himself in Li Mingjin's arms and missed the bridal chamber. He really couldn't say such a thing.It was the first time they were lying on the bed like this, and they were not too sleepy.Compared with the nervous Luo Shuyu, Li Mingjin was obviously more tense, lying upright. He dared to hold Luo Shuyu's hand last night because he fell asleep.Suddenly, Li Mingjin smelled Luo Shuyu's fragrance, Luo Shuyu lay on his side and approached him: \"His Royal Highness.\"Li Mingjin's voice was low, suppressing his inner desire: \"Huh?\" He felt Luo Shuyu's hand on his arm , heart pounding, \"Can't sleep?\"Luo Shuyu: \"No, I want to talk to you for a while.\"Li Mingjin looked at him sideways: \"What do you want to say?\"Luo Shuyu: \"I heard that before the imperial decree, you want to admit Shen Mingyun into the mansion.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How could he still know?.Li Mingjin was thinking about the appropriate answer. While he was pondering, Luo Shuyu said in a slightly disappointed voice, \"Don't be embarrassed, Your Highness.\"Mixed with grievances, Li Mingjin held his hand on his arm: \"It's not that I can't tell you, I didn't want to admit him to the mansion, and I never thought of him that way, it should be a misunderstanding.\" Now he especially regret having an encounter with Shen Mingyun, \"I'll tell you.\"Luo Shuyu replied, \"Yeah.\"Li Mingjin considered his tone, and was low as always: \"If you don't mention this, I've almost forgotten about it. At that time, I was drinking with people in the restaurant, and when I was drinking, I suddenly heard a group of people making noise downstairs, so I sent someone down to see what was going on. The person who came back said that there was a gongzi who was bullied by a few drunk alcoholics, so I asked someone to help him, and after the matter was settled, the person I helped had to come upstairs to thank me.\"Luo Shuyu moved down, resting his head naturally on his shoulders.In his past life, he liked to lean on him like this when he was uncomfortable during pregnancy, and Li Mingjin at that time also let him lean on him.Luo Shuyu: \"That person is Shen Mingyun?\"Li Mingjin: \"Well, I met him once before, at that time, I was on the flower boat to capture the assassin who wanted to assassinate me. During the torture, Shen Mingyun suddenly jumped out. He said that I was cruel and wanted me to release him (the assassin), and he interrupted my torture, and I didn\u2019t want to cause trouble, so I told him to stop meddling.\u201dLuo Shuyu asked why it was different from what was written in the book, and repeated: \u201cActually, Did you torture the assassin at that time?\"Li Mingjin: \"Well, the second time I saw Shen Mingyun, he recognized me first and yelled in front of everyone that I was a murderous madman without blinking eyes. It was too noisy, so I casually told someone to tie him back to my mansion, but I didn't tie him in the end.\"\"At first I thought he might be related to the person who assassinated me, because the assassin I caught on the boat, after he (SMY) appeared for the first time, someone killed him (the assassin) that night. But it was later proved that the assassin's death had nothing to do with Shen Mingyun. Second When I saw him the next time, the words I said casually were passed on by other people present at the time, and there were rumors that I wanted to admit him into the mansion, but it was not the case.\"\"Yu'er, don't worry about it. They spread rumors because I usually don't get close to women and gers. Suddenly, a beautiful ger approached me.\"Luo Shuyu: \"So that's how it is.\" So this is ah.Li Mingjin: \"You believe what I said?\"Luo Shuyu said without hesitation: \"I naturally believe you.\"When Shen Mingyun was rescued by him, he didn't thank him, but suspected that his purpose was not pure, including his emperor father who didn't believe that he would save people, Luo Shuyu's unconditional trust made him felt more satisfied than ever.There were ups and downs in his heart, and he naturally wanted to do something: \"Yu'er, can I...\"Luo Shuyu didn't wait for him to finish, and took the initiative to lean forward and kissed Li Mingjin's lips: \"Yes, no matter what you want to do to me, you can do anything.\" In other words, don't ask, as long as it's you, you don't need to ask anything, I'm willing.Li Mingjin was caught off guard and was kissed by Luo Shuyu's soft and fragrant lips. The desire in his eyes was ready to come out. No matter how many brochures he read, it would be better to come up directly. He didn't think that his imperial concubine would be more active. Li Mingjin kissed back hard while his hand on the back of his head.Luo Shuyu, who had no martial arts, was not as long-lasting as Li Mingjin. After being kissed for a long time, he was a little breathless. Both of them were relatively inexperienced in this area. Luo Shuyu's face was flushed from the kiss, and he put his hand on Li Mingjin's chest and whispered: \"I, I'm going to sleep.\"Li Mingjin lightly held Luo Shuyu's hand in front of his chest: \"Okay.\"Not only was his face hot, but his whole body was hot, and now it was okay to go out to take a cold shower, but it was a little uncomfortable down there. He told himself that he would endure it for a while, and when his leg was healed, he would be able to live a normal husband's life.Luo Shuyu was really sleepy, and soon fell asleep beside Li Mingjin. Li Mingjin listened to his gradually steady breathing, and became sleepy as well. After falling asleep, he unconsciously embraced his imperial concubine again in his arms.The two had a good night's sleep.the next day.Luo Shuyu slept until he woke up naturally.There were no plans to go out today, no one disturbed him, and he slept well. This was the most stable sleep since his rebirth.There was no one around, and Li Mingjin had already woken up.The first two days the temperature remained high. When he woke up, it felt a little colder.Qingwang, who was guarding him, immediately handed him thicker clothes: \"Gongzi, the weather is getting colder, you should wear more clothes.\"Luo Shuyu nodded, and after washing up, he asked Qingwang, \"Where's Your Highness?\"Qingwang smiled and said, \"His Royal Highness just ordered the servants to move things to the study in the main courtyard. He is working there and it's convenient for him to talk to you more.\"Luo Shuyu walked outside the door, and sure enough, he saw the servants moving things, but Li Mingjin was nowhere to be seen: \"Has your Highness had breakfast?\"Qingwang's ability to observe words and expressions was good: \"Not yet.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Then find him back for breakfast.\"As soon as he finished speaking, Li Mingjin's low voice came from behind. \"Are you looking for me?\"\"Why did you run behind me?\" Luo Shuyu was almost startled by him, \"Let's have breakfast together.\"Li Mingjin: \"Yeah.\"The breakfast was relatively light and prepared according to Luo Shuyu's taste, Luo Shuyu ate to his heart's content.After breakfast, Li Mingjin went to the rearranged study room, and Luo Shuyu continued to pack the boxes.Near noon, Luo Shuyu went to Li Mingjin with the newly steamed millet cake from the kitchen.He heard someone communicated with Li Mingjin from the inside, and Li Mingjin asked him to go in directly.There were two staff members who were kept in the house.One was Liang Jianxue, who was in his early 40s with a beard, and the other was Chen Rong, who had a pale face.Luo Shuyu had seen them in his past life, but he had never dealt with them very much. He could recall very little of his contact with them, but he knew that these two had different personalities. Liang Jianxue was more anxious, and Chen Rong was more stable but the body didn't look very good. He drank medicine all the year round, and there was always a strong smell of medicine on his body. It was a typical of medicine jar.The two got up and saluted Luo Shuyu: \"I have seen the third imperial concubine.\"Luo Shuyu waived their salute: \"The two gentlemen are exempted.\"When Li Mingjin saw Luo Shuyu coming, he asked the two gentlemen to go back first. After they left, Luo Shuyu asked Li Mingjin: \"Where did that Mr. Chen come from?\"Looking at Chen Rong's back as he walked away slowly, he suddenly remembered that Shen Mingyun met a Mr. Chen in his later period. Some people called him the reincarnation of Zhuge, but he didn't know why he didn't\u00a0 want to go out when Shen Mingyun went to invite him three times, but Chen Rong always refused, and Shen Mingyun, who was impatient, gave up later. Within two days of giving up, the fourth prince suddenly told Shen Mingyun that Mr. Chen died of illness in the yard he rented.[Zhuge = Zhuge Liang (181-234), military leader and prime minister of Shu Han, during the Three Kingdoms period the main hero of the fictional Romance of Three Kingdoms, where he is portrayed as a sage and military genius mastermind]Luo Shuyu was a little suspicious. Mr. Chen had just rejected Shen Mingyun for two days, why did he suddenly disappear?When Li Mingjin saw Luo Shuyu's sudden silence, he was not very happy: \"He's just a sick seedling, why are you curious about his origin?.\" Although Chen Rong looked ill, he was still quite handsome, and he was the favorite among women and gers in the boudoir.Luo Shuyu narrowed his eyes and looked at him, then picked up a piece of warm millet cake and stuffed it into his mouth: \"Is this cake a little sour?\"Li Mingjin: \"...\" It's not sour, it's sweet.The author has something to say:The Third Prince: I want to try it, I heard it's very sweet, but I have never eaten it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The crown prince was not a fuel-efficient lamp, and the eldest prince couldn't sleep well. Li Mingjin's suspicion of Luo Shuyu's existence gradually decreased.At the beginning of the fight, Li Mingjin was a little suspicious that Luo Shuyu was suddenly too kind to him. Not only did he cry when he saw him for the first time, but he also took the initiative to send him drawings. He was skeptical for a while, but after investigation, he found that the crown\u00a0 prince had verified the drawings in person, and it seemed that there was no disadvantage to him. His imperial concubine was credible, mainly because he really didn't find any shortcomings.\u00a0 He was top-notch in everything, beautiful and kind-hearted, and he had a special taste for him, and he had an excellent temper.When Luo Shuyu asked about Chen Rong, Li Mingjin also observed his expression. He asked very naturally and his expression was the same.Li Mingjin swallowed the millet cake, pulled Luo Shuyu to the seat where he had just sat, and asked him, \"Why do you want to know his origin?\"Luo Shuyu noticed him because he saw Chen Rong himself, before he didn't think about it because he didn't meet him. Now, as soon as he encountered people and plots related to the book, relevant content would automatically appear in his mind, and he himself didn't want to miss the slightest bit of useful information.It was also a temporary intention to come to the study to find Li Mingjin with the millet cake. Unlike the drawings, he had to figure out the reason in advance . He suddenly asked about Chen Rong, and there was really no special reason to explain it. However, after thinking about it, he had an idea. When Shen Mingyun couldn't explain the fresh ideas he came up with in the book, he used the mysterious person to explain it.Luo Shuyu, \"Do you still remember the mysterious person I mentioned to you?\"Li Mingjin: \"Remember.\" But he never met the mysterious person Luo Shuyu mentioned, and he probably met Luo Shuyu before their marriage.Luo Shuyu took advantage of the situation and broke it down. It seemed that it wasn't a big problem to replace the book with a mysterious person. \"There is a gentleman surnamed Chen who is quite intelligent and resourceful, and has a rare talent, I don't know if he is the same as Mr. Chen, so I have this question.\"Li Mingjin: \"So it is.\" Chen Rong As his assistant, he was so old, and he couldn't see him every time, there was no need to hide it from Luo Shuyu, he said, \"Chen Rong was the one who took the initiative to mention to me that he wanted to be my assistant, and his ancestors were the champion. Later, because of the change of dynasty, the whole family moved to Jiangnan, which is considered innocent. It's just that this person is a bit weird and has no interest in the imperial examinations, but as you said, he is resourceful and foresight. Someone has recommended him to me before, but I just forget about it, I thought that talented people would choose to go to the Crown Prince's Mansion or the First Prince's Mansion. Later, to my surprise, he recommended himself to me. I asked him why he chose to go to the Third Prince's Mansion, and he told me that he just wanted to protect the peace, I don't know what it means.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Maybe it means literally?\"Li Mingjin: \"No matter what, it's just that we have an extra mouth in the house, and it doesn't matter.\"Luo Shuyu smiled: \"That's true.\"At this time, it was not appropriate to ask Li Mingjin whether to fight for that position, the first prince and the crown prince were fighting each other, why not watched them fight to death and gave them a little firewood occasionally, wouldn't it be more interesting?Li Mingjin mentioned another thing: \"We will return to Luofu\u00a0 tomorrow, do I need to add more gifts?\"[Luofu = Luo Mansion]Luo Shuyu said: \"It's fine to follow the rules, no need to add more.\" He had no nostalgia for the Luo family, and even hated each of them. If he hadn't taken care of the face of the Third Prince's Mansion, he wouldn't even want to keep this etiquette.Li Mingjin had long known the grievances between Luo Shuyu and Liu Shi. He had never been stained with blood. The punishment for Liu Shi was already a severe sentence, but in Li Mingjin's view, cutting grass needed to be eradicated. Let her know that entering the nunnery was the beginning of the punishment, Luo Shuyu shouldn't get involved with blood, and these things should be solved by him as a husband.On the second day of the wedding, the husband and wife were still cultivating their relationship in the house. After all, in Li Mingjin's current situation, he couldn't leave the house.At night, the wind turned, and it was the smell of autumn. Li Mingjin tried to practice kissing with Luo Shuyu again, and kissed Luo Shuyu until his face was flushed red before letting him go. In this regard, he was slowly making progress, and he felt that kissing on the bed wouldn't be a problem. Things were getting more and more tormenting, especially wanting to go down, but his body wasn't up to his expectations, and he regretted countless times for committing stupid things for a few days. He was too young and ignorant.The third day of the wedding was Guining Day. Li Mingjin said that he would go with Luo Shuyu. Luo Shuyu looked at his leg in embarrassment. Li Mingjin still insisted.[gu\u012b n\u00edng (literary) (of a married woman) to visit one's parents]Compared with returning to Luofu, it was obviously more important to protect Li Mingjin's leg. After changing the medicine on his leg, they set off.Luo Renshou sent a housekeeper to wait at the door early in the morning, and also informed Mrs. Luo that she must be prepared, and told her not to show her timidity in front of the third prince, and not to lose her etiquette. Mrs. Luo immediately told him to go to court immediately. The third prince could still eat her?.Less than an hour before noon, Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu appeared at the entrance of Luofu.The housekeeper stood at the door all morning, his head almost swelled by the wind this morning, his legs trembled a little, and he knelt down when he saw the carriage of the third prince.Luo Shuyu: \"...\" He thought to himself that it was rare for a housekeeper who always looked down on others to kneel so simply.Li Mingjin supported his legs and with\u00a0 Luo Shuyu slowly moved into Luofu. The eldest son of Luofu, Luo Shumo, received them. Facing Luo Shuyu, who was about to send his mother to a nunnery, he was still smiling. Luo Shuyu saw that he was smiling, it was too fake, and he felt that this eldest brother's tolerance was very comparable.\"I have seen the third prince, the third imperial concubine. My father will come back later to share lunch with the two of you. He led me to meet the two of you.\"Li Mingjin's face was as calm as ever. Luo Shumo felt that he was not satisfied, so he had to continue to smile.Luo Shuyu was distant and polite: \"Big brother doesn't have to be polite.\" On the way into the main hall, Luo Shuyu found that Luofu was so noisy today. \"Is there a happy event in the house today?\"Luo Shumo changed his polite face just now, and faintly said proudly: \"There is a competition outside today, and everyone wants to join in the fun. It's estimated that they are discussing the current situation.\" Cousin Shen's idea, he couldn't help but be happy for him, but he didn't want to tell Luo Shuyu what Shen Mingyun was busy with.Luo Shuyu thought to himself: Competition?He had been so comfortable these two days that he almost forgot the start time of \"Huakui 101\", he quietly looked at Li Mingjin, while Li Mingjin patted his arm twice, with a gloomy face and said impatiently: \"Don't you want to see the old lady? Hurry up, we have something to do after lunch.\" Compared with Luo Shumo, the patience he showed was heaven and earth.But Luo Shuyu was happy to see it happened, so he would have a reason to leave Luofu earlier, and staying here was only increased the feeling of disgust.He laughed in his heart and said, \"Okay, Your Highness.\" It was estimated that he wanted to see the Huakui competition.Luo Shumo didn't know that their husbands were playing dumb riddles. Hearing Li Mingjin spoke to Luo Shuyu in a cold tone, Luo Shuyu laughed with him. Those who didn't know it thought he was Luo Shuyu's creditor and owed him tens thousands taels of gold. He guessed that the third brother should have a bad time in the Third Prince's Mansion, but this was inevitable, Who was the third prince?, was it so easy to be figured out by one person?, and they had been married for two days only.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Luo Shuyu took someone to Fushouju alone to symbolically see the old lady. After returning this time, it was estimated that he wouldn't have to deal with the people of Luofu for a long time.He and the old lady didn't have a strong grandmother-grandchild relationship. When Luo Shuyu arrived, the old lady was not too enthusiastic. She only asked him why the third prince didn't come in. Luo Shuyu said that the third prince was inconvenient to enter the backyard. The old lady was relieved, but saw that Luo Shuyu didn't look too bad, so he asked him if the third prince treated him well, and told him to give birth to the royal grandson as soon as possible.Why did the old lady \"reminded\" Luo Shuyu about the emperor's grandson? As we all knew, although Emperor Tiansheng himself gave birth to several sons, and each of them was a dragon and a phoenix, it was a pity that his grandson was not very lucky. The first prince's residence had given birth to two daughters. After accepting two wive, including the crown princess, more than two years had passed, and there was still no movement in the belly, no one knew what happened.If Luo Shuyu gave birth to a grandson before them, then his status would naturally be very different from other princes in the future, and it would definitely rise in the royal family. It was possible to be loved by Emperor Tiansheng. They all said that they couldn't speculate on the Holy's Will, but they all tried to figure out the Holy's Heart to the fullest.Luo Shuyu listened and kept it in his heart. Sometimes other people's words could always wake him up. The old lady was really hitting right this time. Luo Shuyu didn't want to stand in front of Emperor Tiansheng. He didn't really want the child to come into this world too early. Afraid of him being punished.In the last life, when his child arrived, Emperor Tiansheng had already held his grandson, and it was still born by the crown princess. On the day of the full moon wine, Emperor Tiansheng named him himself, which showed how much he liked that child. No one knew if this grandson was born prematurely or because of his poor health, he died before the age of two.Later, the second one who gave birth to the emperor's grandson turned out to be Shen Mingyun, who was married to the fourth prince. Emperor Tiansheng, who was in pain for a while, immediately rewarded countless people, and the fourth prince and Shen Mingyun were the same for a while.However, because of the death of the first grandson, the children of the fourth prince's family didn't hold the full moon wine. He (the fourth prince) said that it would be better to catch Zhou Li and did it again. The child was too young to suffer from too heavy blessings. Emperor Tiansheng remembered this son who had been neglected by him for many years and began to reuse him.[ zh\u00f3u li = \u5468\u793c the Rites of Zhou (in Confucianism)]Gui Ning didn't run in vain this time. After sitting with the old lady for a while, Luo Shuyu went to the front hall to find Li Mingjin, lest he would get bored after sitting there for a long time.As soon as he walked out of Fushouju, Luo Shuyu saw Luo Shuyao who was about to go out. The other party also saw him with a look of resentment, but he didn't dare to say more when he saw the strong maid beside him. He just whispered when Luo Shuyu passed by: \"Wait for me, Luo Shuyu, someone will take care of you.\"Luo Shuyu really heard it accidentally, he stood still and turned to Luo Shuyao: \"Tell me who is going to take care of me. ?\"Luo Shuyao was taken aback by his approaching momentum: \"...You heard it wrong.\"Luo Shuyu stared at him coldly: \"Luo Shuyao, you will pay for your mouth in the future.\" He remembered that in the book, although he (Luo Shuyao) was not badly punished by Shen Mingyun, but because Shen Mingyun said in public that he had a bad temper and was like a shrew, his marriage was not easy to find, and finally married a man who already\u00a0 had a direct son to be the successor. But there was Liu Shi at that time, this man was quite sincere to Luo Shuyao, and he really didn't know much about the other.After successfully frightening Luo Shuyao, Luo Shuyu began to ponder his words. Luo Shuyao always spoke without thinking, and his emotions were written on his face. Easy got into the trouble.When he returned to the main hall, Luo Renshou had already came back and was talking to Li Mingjin. He was talking and Li Mingjin was listening. The latter was very indifferent. Fortunately, Luo Renshou could bear it. If it was someone else, didn't know what would happen.Lunch was prepared according to the specifications of the distinguished guests. It was rare for Luo Shuyu to eat this kind of food in Luofu, and he felt a little colder for the Luo family.Before leaving, Luo Shuyu specially reminded Luo Renshou: \"Father, is Liu Shi still in the mansion?\"Luo Renshou's face was not very good when he heard his words: \"I will handle this matter, you can do your duty as the\u00a0 third imperial concubine with peace of mind.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Then I also hope that my father will deal with it as soon as possible, preferably before the Mid-Autumn Festival.\"Luo Renshou only now knew how ruthless Luo Shuyu was. Wasn't it tomorrow before the Mid-Autumn Festival?He almost didn't come up in one breath. Just as he was about to say a few words, Li Mingjin urged him: \"Let's go.\"Luo Shuyu followed him out of Luofu without looking back, and Luo Renshou made a pretentious gesture of reluctance behind him.The two didn't directly return to the Third Prince's Mansion, but drove the carriage straight to Yunsheng Street.\"Where are we going?\" Luo Shuyu didn't expect that the hint Li Mingjin gave him in Luofu was true, \"Watching the huakui competition?\"\"Of course, you will like it.\" Li Mingjin said that he would solve the matter of\u00a0 huakui 101 for him.He was afraid that he couldn't do it. After all, officials and people were involved, as well as nobles. However, it was always possible to stop the huakui competition.Luo Shuyu didn't know what he was selling. He was not in a hurry and should be able to see it soon.The huakui competition was crowded with people. Many literates and writers were sitting in the temporary auditorium. There were hundreds of spectators invited under the stage. Shen Mingyun called it a support card.Li Mingjin took Luo Shuyu to the private room of a restaurant, where the view was very good, and he could see everything that was happening on the stage.Luo Shuyu could see from here that Shen Mingyun was talking and laughing with two or three people who were\u00a0 standing beside him, some male and female. When he was happy, he even patted the shoulder of the man beside him, laughing loudly, he seemed to forget himself was a ger, but it was also understandable since Shen Mingyun was originally a pure and simple man, but he also liked a man, that was, a broken sleeve.[broken sleeve = gay]Li Mingjin followed Luo Shuyu's line of sight and said, \"Shen Mingyun is also smart. Everyone can watch the huakui competition without anyone buying a ticket. Seeing him suffer, he is actually very good at taking advantage of people's hearts.\"\"Probably his ideas are different from others.\" Luo Shuyu said in his heart that he didn't come up with this, but it was copied from others, and we hadn't seen it before.\"No wonder the eldest brother and the fourth brother admire him quite a bit. His ideas are very useful.\" Who didn't want a money bag that could make money.Ansan followed slightly.Li Mingjin asked him: \"How is the game now?\"Ansan: \"Back to the master, it's halfway through, and there are still sixteen women from the brothel who haven't played yet.\"Li Mingjin: \"Well.\"Luo Shuyu diligently poured tea for Li Mingjin : \"Your Highness, what are you taking me to see?\"Li Mingjin twitched the corners of his mouth and smiled with confidence: \"Wait for a while and there will be a better performance.\"Li Mingjin was inexplicably laughed at by him: \"What are you laughing at?\"Luo Shuyu: \"Laughing at you.\"Li Mingjin: \"What's wrong with me?\"Luo Shuyu considered the appropriate words: \"Well, it's pretty and handsome.\"Li Mingjin: \"\u2026 ...\" It turned out that his wife said that he smiled handsomely.The sweet moment in the private room was not long. Li Mingjin was digesting the fact that Luo Shuyu praised him as \"handsome \" when there was a sudden noise from downstairs.Li Mingjin jumped and dragged Luo Shuyu to the window and said, \"The performance has begun.\"Luo Shuyu looked down at the direction of the performance area, and the entire performance area was in chaos !The author has something to say:The third prince: Wife, do you like hey hey or hey hey hey?Luo Shuyu: ...Go awayPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you slow down, you will be burned to death!\"\"Fire master, where is the fire master? Help! Come on!\"\"Someone, help, God, help me!\"This time, not only the selected ordinary people who came to watch the game, but also a group of people who watched the fun and didn't think it was a big deal. The princes and nobles, they were the first batch of guests to get VIP seats, such as the eldest prince who was sitting in the best viewing position. For now, he had the best relationship with Luofu, and Shen Mingyun left him a VIP seat.According to normal circumstances, the closer you were to the center of the stage, the better you could see the performances of the huakui on the stage. But now, the closer you were to the stage, the faster you would be hit by the thick smoke, you would be choked with smoke, your eyes would be so hot that you could only narrow it, and you couldn't see the road clearly. If you wanted to evacuate immediately, it was too late. At this time, the VIP area was also the place where the thickest smoke reached the fastest, and the wind was blowing straight in this direction.The eldest prince was guarded by several guards. If someone didn't guard him, he would probably be knocked over by others.Now, most of the nobles in the VIP seats were guarded by their servants and left, and there was no order at all. It depended on who could squeeze faster and who could get closer to the stairs leading to the downstairs earlier!Someone asked why not jump down? Isn't it only the second floor?However, Shen Mingyun suggested to build a temporary VIP seat. In order to let the spectators experience the illusion of a high altitude, he built it higher, so that no one dared to jump, moron, the height was too high.The first prince covered his mouth and nose with his sleeves, but he was still choked and coughing: \"Cough cough!\"The guard: \"The first prince, the crowd below is very chaotic, we won't be able to go out for a while, I'm afraid those people will hurt you.\"The first prince: \"Cough! Hurry up! No way! Cough! If we stay here, we all will\u00a0 be burned to death!\"The guard: \"Yes!\"The stage was set up in the original competition area, this was an official rented place. As long as the money was enough, it could be rented to the commoner. Shen Mingyun liked this wide location. He also fenced the entire audience hall to ensure safety. Shen Mingyun plagiarized very well. Afraid that the \"fans\" in the later period would be too fond of their favorite huakui, he came up with this idea. It was a pity that his idea was not very useful now, and it became an obstacle for everyone to escape.The 300 \"spectators\" felt as they were about to \"burn\" themselves immediately, and together they kicked the fence. It was more chaos, like the scene of a bloodbath being beaten for a steamed bun in the extreme refugee camp.The first prince and others were on the second floor, and they managed to squeeze through the crowd to the first floor. As soon as they saw a little hope, they were about to rush to the fence. However, in the thick smoke, a group of masked strong men dressed in gray sackcloth rushed towards them, blocking their way towards the fence.The masked strong men slashed at the first prince Li Mingyu and others without saying a word with big swords!\"Come here, hurry up, come and protect the first prince!\"\"There are assassins! There are assassins! There are assassins!\"\"His Royal Highness! I will protect you!\"The first prince was so frightened that his face turned pale. He had no weapons in his hand, only a jade flute used for decoration, which was chopped to pieces after a few moments.The assassin who originally remained silent suddenly said: \"Li Mingyu, you are too fucking inauthentic! If you don't keep your word, we will help you kill, but you have to kill my brothers. The debtor, I want to avenge my dead brother! Today is your death!\"The first prince was not very good at fight, and was guarded by the guards. He covered his nose and stucked his head out. Unable to escape, he was still nervous: \"What nonsense are you talking about!\"The assassin leader: \"We killed for you a few days ago, and we chased the people to the edge of the cliff according to your order and fulfilled your order. This is a deal, but you kill us in turn, and you won't pay one thousand taels of silver!\"The first prince: \"Shut up! Don't frame me!\"The assassin leader hummed, roared and slashed at the first prince again, but was blocked by the first prince's guards.The scene was still very chaotic, scream one after another.The first prince's guards' martial arts were considered high-level, and they could temporarily block the fierce attacks of the assassins.Not only was the first prince's eyes red from being smoked, but when the guards resisted the assassin and had no time to take care of him, someone kicked him from behind and pushed him to the ground. Not to mention his knees were bruised. The proud handsome face was also beaten until his nose was blue and his face was swollen, the corners of his mouth were bleeding, and his teeth were loose.The smoke seemed to be fading, and the assassins suddenly backed away and blended into the crowd!The first prince was helped up by the guards, and they ran towards the gate. The smoke was not so thick here, but when they recovered, they found that the assassins had disappeared without a trace, and the survivors of the aftermath had disappeared. The first prince covered the blood at the corners of his mouth and only ran for his life. He never thought about why they suddenly appeared and disappeared. As long as he saved his life, he was lucky!After escaping for their lives from the competition site, the guards from the government office rushed over, and the scene was quickly suppressed. The fleeing people had long since disappeared in the crowded Yunsheng Street, and all that remained were the nobles of the VIP area, all of them very indignant. In the capital, the assassins chased after them and they escaped for their lives. If they hadn't run fast, the assassins must have stabbed them.In fact, only the first prince was injured the most. His injuries frightened the yamen people who were serving as emissaries today. Who was to blame and the Holy One would punish them!The boss who held this competition was summoned by the official, and they escaped without any injuries. Seeing the tragic state of the first prince, he almost died on the spot, but he could only cry without tears to the first prince and the nobles for apologize.It was true that they didn't think carefully about this matter. Who would have thought that people would be stared at on the day of the competition, and this kind of thing happened, and they were too excited and didn't take precautions beforehand.The eldest prince was angry, annoyed, and hurts all over his body. Those assassins were specifically targeting him!At this time, the people of the government office began to investigate the cause of the fire at the scene.They found thirty braziers at the bottom of the stage, all of which were burning the most choking wet wood. Someone must have arranged it in advance.Today, the first prince was the only injured person at the scene. The government office had to give an account no matter what, and the officers directly took the boss back for interrogation.The eldest prince asked the guards: \"Where's the assassin? So many people didn't see them going out?\"The guard had to show Li Mingyu the dozen or so black cloth strips they had taken back: \"Returning to the first prince, these people must be taking advantage of smoke, they pretended to be ordinary people and ran to Yunsheng Street.\"The governor of the capital, who learned that the situation was serious, hurried over: \"Hurry up and investigate, I want to know how they got in. Actually took advantage of the crowd to attack the first prince!\"The first prince was escorted by a group of officers and soldiers, sent him directly back to the first prince's mansion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After the assassination of the third prince, he sent someone to deal with these desperados, so why they were still alive?The first prince panicked in his heart. He was talking to someone just now, and he must have let others listen. He must not let others know that he colluded with the Jiangyang bandit. The crown prince had gained the upper hand several times. He even stole his waterwheel blueprint a few days ago, which was absolutely hateful!However, after all, the huakui competition and drawings were all related to Shen Mingyun. Could it be that he secretly took refuge with the crown prince? Otherwise, nothing happened when the crown prince came over in the morning, how could the assassins appeared in his turn?At this time, after Shen Mingyun hid from the stage with a group of young people from the brothels who participated in the huakui competition, he asked in the corner, what was going on to the system?The system told him: \"It's a man-made fire.\" It wouldn't say any more, or in fact it couldn't detect it.After a while, the government office sent people over to ask them if they had seen suspicious people. According to the first prince, those people were all men.They thought for a while and didn't find anyone who matched them. They were all young girls and gers raised in the building. All of them were so weak that they couldn't even hold a knife, so they didn't ask any more questions.Shen Mingyun took advantage of the fact that no one noticed him, and used a seven-minute invisibility item to leave from the back exit.Now that the boss had been caught, there was no benefit even if he stayed, only increased his risk.He said to the system: \"The co-organized bosses were brought in for questioning, and I wonder if the huakui competition can continue.\"\" There are not many points left.\"Shen Mingyun said impatiently: \"I know, you don't have to worry about me, I will find a way to make the competition go ahead.\" If he knew that he wouldn't have bought all kinds of beauty and skin care props. Now it wasn't enough to buy more props for body protection, not to mention that he still wanted to buy high-level props.The system mall was divided into five levels. After completing the task, you would also get points when you got mall coins. When a certain standard was reached, the system mall would be automatically upgraded. There would be huge differences in different levels of the same item, and the effect was also very different. It was as big as a gap the old, broken and small, 1,000 yuan per square meter and the 200,000 yuan per square-meter Shanghai Bund Building.He just regretted that he didn't use his mall coins properly and rationally. Who would know that there were still unfinished tasks, and he had been a little unlucky recently, and several tasks had reversed on the way.Shen Mingyun asked the system: \"Can you give me some easy-to-follow tasks? A little less points will do.\"The system: \"The tasks are random, and as a system, I have no right to interfere.\"Shen Mingyun: \"Can't you open the back door for me? We all have been in this world for more than a year.\"The system: \"The system has systematic rules, and tasks cannot be assigned at will, please don't think about taking shortcuts, please complete the tasks well to get rewards.\"Shen Mingyun simply wanted to be crazy, He didn't know if the Fengshui of Luo\u2019s family was not good. Since he returned from Dajue Temple, everything no longer smooth sailing.Three tasks had failed, and he spent more than 200 mall coins to get the blueprints from the mall, but in the end, the bamboo basket was empty.It must be the first prince who was too eloquent and secretly told the women around him, which caused their research for more than two months to go in vain. The first prince was so fucking unsatisfactory, he couldn't support the wall with mud!It seemed that it was the time for him to change his thighs, and he couldn't have only one thigh.[thigh = the backer]The crown prince's mother family was too powerful, and he definitely wouldn't be able to escape the fate of being divided up after he ascended the throne. He wasn't a good candidate.He was originally optimistic about the first prince, but unfortunately this blueprint incident made him retreat a little, and eggs couldn't be put in one basket at the same time.The third prince was too cruel and wasn't a good candidate for the future monarch. He was almost tied to the third prince's mansion before. This man was not only cruel, but he must also covet his beauty. Fortunately, it was Luo Shuyu who finally married into the third prince's mansion. Failing to stop his wedding and not getting the quest reward, Shen Mingyun also wrote a note on him, the newly married husband and wife seemed to be against him, which was annoying.The snobbery behind the fourth prince was a bit weak, and it wasn't suitable for the time being, but he had a very good impression him, gentle and courteous, moderated in advance and retreat, and understood romance. He was a rare man and could be placed in the pending seat.Shen Mingyun had a hard time choosing among the three princes. In the end, he hesitated. He separated and placed bets on the three of them. At least he was a prince, and presumably these three wouldn't embarrass him in the future.He was regretting it now for not reading the full chapters. If he knew, he would scold the author. He should have finished reading that particularly boring book in the first place. Who knew that when he woke up, he would directly travel to the book, and there was a system that always assigned the tasks to him.If he had finished reading the book seriously, he would know how to choose, and he could only continue to rely on luck and props.The system is in his hand, He had the world!Quietly returning to the mansion, Shen Mingyun received a letter sent to him by the Fourth Prince.Looking at the dried flower petals on the top of the letter, Shen Mingyun thought to himself, as expected of the male god he recognized, gentle and emotional, and the words were written very well.When the scene was chaotic, Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin were upstairs to see the movements of everyone on the field clearly. The other's hair, and the fact that someone else's brother was too fat to run slowly in front of his brother, the \"good brother\" pushed him aside directly and ran across his body to get water.In short, Luo Shuyu was really eye-opening today.But since it was Li Mingjin who brought him to watch the show, it meant that this \"water-running incident\" was in his plan.The first prince was frightened enough today, but this incident was only a false alarm in the end. Except for the skin injuries caused by the nobles pushing each other, the ordinary people slid quickly without any casualties.Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu returned to the table and sat down.Luo Shuyu asked his doubts: \"But this shouldn't be enough to stop the huakui competition. After the bosses are released, they will definitely continue. After all, there is a lot of money invested in the early stage.\"Li Mingjin poured him a glass and changed it to tea that just came up: \"There's more in the back, don't be in a hurry, it will definitely make them vigilant.\"Luo Shuyu was not worried about whether Li Mingjin's arrangements were well-organized or not. He took a sip of tea and asked him, \"Among the people, do you arrange for your own people to go in?\"Li Mingjin's gloomy face seemed to light up, and it suddenly became brighter: \"Well.\" Luo Shuyu guessed his arrangement, He was secretly delighted in his heart.Luo Shuyu didn't know what happened to his confused expression now: \"What's the plan for the second step?\"Li Mingjin once again sold out: \"You will know when the time comes.\"Luo Shuyu held the teacup and smiled, Li Mingjin only felt that it was not an autumn day with fallen leaves overnight, but a spring day with spring flowers blooming.After the play was over, it was boring to sat and drank tea only. Li Mingjin asked Luo Shuyu: \"It's rare to come out, why don't we go for a walk?\"Luo Shuyu was still worried about his legs: \"But your legs are inconvenient now, will it be inconvenient?\"Li Mingjin Said, \"My legs are out of the way, and the swelling is almost gone.\"Luo Shuyu stared at him, thinking that it was rare for Li Mingjin to take the initiative to mention it, so he agreed: \"That's it.\"The two slowly moved to the street, where there were so many shops, They didn't know where to look, and Luo Shuyu didn't come out often.An old man passed by holding a bunch of candied haws, and Li Mingjin's eyes followed him: \"Yu'er, I guess you want to eat candied haws.\"Luo Shuyu was stunned for a moment, and said, \" I think about it.\"Qingwang behind them immediately paid after buying the candied haws. Li Mingjin never took his eyes off the candied haws. Luo Shuyu suddenly understood, and he shoved the candied haws directly into his hand: \"I remembered that I just drank a bit too much tea, and I can't eat it for the time being.\"Li Mingjin said: \"Don't eat and it's a waste, I will eat.\"Luo Shuyu: \"...\" Are you sure I was the one who wanted to eat?Afterwards, they passed by the clay dolls booth. Li Ming stood in front of the booth with a crutch, staring at the clay doll in the boss's hand: \"Yu'er, I guess you want to put on those pair of clay dolls.\"Luo Shuyu this time said: \"Well, I should want it.\"After a while, a pair of red and blue clay dolls arrived.Then, they continued to walk forward.Just when Luo Shuyu thought they could visit the clothing store, Li Mingjin stood still, and suddenly stared at Luo Shuyu and stopped moving.Luo Shuyu thought his feet hurt, and was about to ask, when suddenly, the smell of barbecue wafted into his nostrils, he looked to the right, there was a shop selling roasted pig trotters, he paused: \"Your Highness, I...\"Li Mingjin pretended to be \"knowing\" and said, \"You must be hungry, right?\"Luo Shuyu sighed helplessly in his heart: \"...Yes.\"The author has something to say:The Third Prince: Wife, it's getting late, you must be hungry!Luo Shuyu: ...Go away!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They went to all the places they could go to eat, drink, and play. When they returned to the house, Luo Shuyu didn't feel hungry at all. Maybe because he ate some barbecue with Li Mingjin.They ate a lot of food in the afternoon, so Luo Shuyu simply asked the kitchen to prepare a relatively light dinner, preferably more vegetarian dishes.Li Mingjin wasn't dissatisfied with the dinner without big fish and meat. He ate a lot during the day. At night, it was enough to eat some side dishes and drank some clear soup.After dinner, Li Mingjin went to the study in the southwest corner that had just been set up, while Luo Shuyu received the ledger and booklet from the steward Sun.Luo Shuyu had an average relationship with Li Mingjin in his past life, and he didn't take the charge of the housekeeper of the Third Prince's Mansion. He was the only imperial concubine in the mansion, but he never mentioned the matter of being the housekeeper, because he never studied it in Luo Mansion. It was okay too.In this life, he married Li Mingjin, and everything was different from the previous life. Li Mingjin obviously trusted him more, and after three days of marriage, he asked the steward to hand over the ledger to him. In a big family, being in charge of the housekeeper was a recognition of the mistress. It seemed like a beautiful scene, but in fact, it wasn't an easy task to manage the daily life of the family. If you were as greedy as the Liu Shi, you could use the management to embezzle money.With the ledger and buklet in his hand, Luo Shuyu knew how many servants in the house, and how much the daily expenses. After all, it was actually quite a lot.After a rough look, Luo Shuyu found that Li Mingjin's private property was also inside, including shops, fields, and some unimaginable businesses. The keys in the warehouse were all handed over to him. Do you trust me so much?Luo Shuyu stared at the ledger, wondering how deeply he had misunderstood Li Mingjin in his past life. As long as he was a little less deserted to him, he would be able to trust himself. How easy it was to gain his trust, he seemed to be blind.Fortunately, now God had given him a chance to be reborn and got to know Li Mingjin one more time.In fact, it wasn't suitable for reading at night. In order to avoid eye disease, he would continue reading it tomorrow. He asked Qingwang to personally save the books about Li Mingjin's private property and locked it in the bottom of the box, mainly to prevent from the rough worker, the four maids in the main courtyard.After guining ended, his daily life would revolve around the Third Prince's Mansion, and at the same time, he still had to continue to pay attention to Shen Mingyun's movements.Looking at the time, it was a little late, and Li Mingjin hadn't returned to his room.He walked outside and looked at the study room from this angle. The candles in the study room were bright. Luo Shuyu was afraid that he would go to bed too late, so he went directly to the study room.The guards standing outside were about to pass the message when Ansan came out and said to them: \"The third prince ordered that the imperial concubine doesn't need to pass the message when he comes to the study room.\"The guards agreed.Luo Shuyu nodded to Ansan, who went into the study room with him.Li Mingjin turned to Luo Shuyu and said, \" Yu'er, come here.\"Luo Shuyu wasn't stupid after all, he must have something to tell him, and this matter may be directly related to Shen Mingyun or Luofu.Li Mingjin sat on the couch in the study room, with a new cushion on it, Luo Shuyu sat opposite him: \"What's wrong?\"Li Mingjin said, \"It's about Shen Mingyun, do you want to hear it?\"\"Naturally.\" Mentioned Shen Mingyun, Luo Shuyu became less tired, \"But, what new ideas does he have?\"Li Mingjin shook his head: \"That's not it, when you lived in Luofu before, have you seen him behave strangely?, unlike ordinary people, has he ever learned the wicked art from any taoist priest?\"Luo Shuyu said in his heart that he didn't learn the wicked art, mainly because he had a system that even Shen Mingyun didn't know where it came from.But these Luo Shuyu couldn't tell Li Mingjin clearly, he thought about it: \"Shen Mingyun came to Luo's house from the border a year ago, and his parents died, so he came to the capital to join my father. I heard that there are many strange people on the border.\"Li Mingjin: \"There are quite a few strange people, and there are many in the capital, but I have never seen the one like Shen Mingyun who can disappear directly in front of others.\"Luo Shuyu exclaimed in a timely manner: \"Does it really disappear out of thin air?\"Li Mingjin : \"Today Anjiu followed him back to Luofu. He disappeared for a quarter of an hour, avoiding the chaotic crowd we saw today. Soon after that, he returned to Luofu. I believe in Anjiu, he should have seen it with his own eyes.\"Luo Shuyu thought that Shen Mingyun should have used a prop that could make him invisible, and when he was discovered by the ignorant ancient people, it could only be regarded as a fairy spell, and he also became a strange person in the eyes of people.Luo Shuyu asked Li Mingjin: \"What does your highness mean?\"Li Mingjin: \"I want to ask if you know this.\"Luo Shuyu: \"In the past, I thought that he was a little weird, and I never thought that he might have learned a strange technique.\" He also couldn't say that he didn't know it at all, otherwise he wouldn't be able to talk about him to Li Mingjin.Li Mingjin: \"Is that the reason you sent someone to stare at him in the first place?\"Luo Shuyu: \"Well, when he came to the capital alone, his clothes was tattered, and his words were relatively vulgar, but these are actually physical, other than that, it's good to live in Luofu. But he suddenly has a shop and a recipe, but it's not too exaggerated to act in Luofu. As far as I know, his shop and recipe weren't given by my father and eldest brother, I was afraid that he would bring us trouble, so I asked you to ask for someone.\"His reasons were reasonable.Li Mingjin listened, and felt more and more that Luo Shuyu was terrified by the origin of his cousin: \"I guess it may be a spy from an enemy country pretending to be your cousin. If he suddenly has these abilities because someone is behind him, then he it also makes sense, has anyone in your Luo family met Shen Mingyun's parents, and do they have similarities?\"Luo Shuyu said in his heart, more than made sense, he didn't have to give some reasons anymore, his husband's ideas really suit his heart, but he couldn't say it was true right away. Shen Mingyun in his previous life colluded with the imperial family of the enemy country, and he also had a history with the other party. The other party was willing to make a deal with the fourth prince for him and helped the fourth prince ascended to the throne.In the book, it was a fact that Shen Mingyun's peach blossoms were blooming, and they were the top grades in all countries.\"My grandmother should be the only one who has seen his mother. I remember the first day I saw him in my grandmother's Fushouju residence. At that time, she said that Shen Mingyun was very similar to his mother, as if it was printed out by a mold. His identity can't be faked, but if you are not a spy, you may have to distinguish it. I heard that there is a disguise technique in the world.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After using the props, his appearance would change according to the appearance of the other party's taste, but it was time-sensitive, and it couldn't be maintained all the time. Therefore, for people who Shen Mingyun didn't like, he wouldn't use this kind of prop, and it wouldn't affect those people's judgment of Shen Mingyun, including Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin.\"If this is the case, then he may become the other party's spy in advance when he lived at the border. Otherwise, how could he be the only one of his family who survived after his city was captured.\" Li Mingjin continued to spread his speculation.Luo Shuyu was amazed by Li Mingjin's thinking, and he took advantage of the situation to strengthen his speculation about Shen Mingyun: \"Your highness is right, I don't think Shen Mingyun is sad at all because of the death of his parents, and I have never seen him worship his parents on Qingming. On that day, he happily prepared the Youth League for us, saying it was their custom.\"The more he said, the more he could realise Shen Mingyun's strange identity, and there was a good reason to get rid of him slowly in the future. Sooner or later, he would meet the imperial family of the enemy country who quietly came to the capital of Daxia.he just hoped that there would be no mistakes in this process. At present, it seemed that Shen Mingyun hadn't suffered much loss, and he could still continue to rely on the system.Although Luo Shuyu had read the book, as he was reborn, some things may change slowly. He had no ability to predict, so he could only judge his next move based on Shen Mingyun's whereabouts, and then destroyed the goal he wanted to achieve.The two sat and discussed with each other. Li Mingjin didn't care about Shen Mingyun too much at first. After discussing with Luo Shuyu, he became more and more suspicious of this person, and he sent more people to watch him. He did so not only to make Luo Shuyu happy, but also for himself. You could also find a breakthrough from Shen Mingyun and investigated the person behind the assassins who assassinated him before.It was late at night, and Li Mingjin talked to him for a while and went back to the room with Luo Shuyu.Lying in bed, they stopped talking about Shen Mingyun and didn't want this person to disturb their husband's life.After the candle was blown out, Li Mingjin got into the bed, rubbed against Luo Shuyu, and kissed him directly on the cheek.\"Yu'er, I want to kiss you.\"Luo Shuyu knew that the fire on his body was burning at one point, so he took the initiative to come up, he had to turn his face, and was bitten.Luo Shuyu took advantage of his breath and said, \"Don't be so hard. My mouth was swollen from your bite last night, and I will meet someone tomorrow.\"Li Mingjin kissed him on the mouth again: \"Yeah.\" He moved his body, kissing and kissing, it was swollen and painful.Luo Shuyu actually didn't understand why he bit so hard, young and strong, just when he was thinking about those things, wouldn't it be uncomfortable to lie on the same bed every day, he blushed and suggested: \"How about I help you with my hands? You, it won't be so uncomfortable.\"\"Can you?\" Li Mingjin changed his kiss to Luo Shuyu's earlobe, \"Yu'er, don't force yourself.\"Luo Shuyu had been married Li Mingjin for many years in their previous lives. Li Mingjin had been his husband for many years. Although these things they hadn't done it, but it was not impossible: \"I don't force myself, we are married, and I should meet your needs.\"Li Mingjin put his hand on his waist, his voice was hoarse and low, and he turned over and lightly gnawed at his neck. Hearing that Luo Shuyu was going to help him, let alone how happy he was.Luo Shuyu hugged him tightly.This night, they rested later than the previous two days.Li Mingjin hugged Luo Shuyu to rest with satisfaction, and Luo Shuyu's face was still hot before falling asleep. He didn't expect that he could help Li Mingjin did this kind of thing, but his hands were a little tired.On the next day, Luo Shuyu didn't see Li Mingjin when he woke up. Only after asking the servants did he find out that Li Mingjin went to the morning court early in the morning and didn't let him get up to serve.Qingwang smiled and said, \"Gongzi, His Highness really loves you. He said that he wouldn't let us wake you up because you didn't get enough sleep.\"Thinking of his crazy behavior last night, he covered his face with a towel. A little ashamed, he could actually do this.Not long after that, Li Mingjin sent someone back to tell Luo Shuyu that he wouldn't come back for lunch and would stay in the palace.Luo Shuyu thought that it might be the Emperor Tiansheng knew that the first prince was beaten so badly yesterday, and he was happy to think that the first prince who was high in the past was beaten so badly.Indeed, exactly as Luo Shuyu guessed, Li Mingjin dragged his injured leg to the rear, and Emperor Tiansheng called him to the imperial study. Not only him, but the crown prince, the first prince, and the fourth prince were all called.Although Li Mingjin wasn't blushing, but something was different after last night.While waiting for the summons outside the imperial study, the first prince covered the corner of his mouth to avoid someone else's scrutiny.The crown prince pretended to be surprised and asked: \"Big brother, what's wrong with your face?\"The first prince glared at him: \"Li Mingze, did you do what happened yesterday ?\"The crown prince was not provoked by him at all, but tutted: \"Brother, it's not right for you to say that, we are brothers, you can't frame me, who knows who will get revenge if you offended someone, if you have the spare time to watch that kind of huakui competition, why not do more things for the father emperor, all day long, you can\u2019t see the flowers only.\u201dThe first prince snorted: \u201cI'm not like some people who only peep at other people\u2019s things, and not afraid or panic\u00a0 when I take them!\u201dHowever the crown prince was in a good mood and turned to Li Mingjin: \"Third brother, your complexion looks good, you are satisfied with the imperial concubine that father has chosen for you.\"Li Mingjin said truthfully: \"Of course I'm satisfied, and you won't be wrong to listen to father.\"The fourth prince stood by without saying a word and observed the three imperial brothers.Before the first prince said something, Eunuch Liang, the most favored man in front of Emperor Tiansheng, opened the door of the imperial study and invited the four brothers in.The four of them entered in the order of honor. The first prince would still obediently abide by the etiquette in front of Emperor Tiansheng.Emperor Tiansheng didn't give them a seat today, and Li Mingjin couldn't sit even if his legs weren't good. It could be seen that Emperor Tiansheng was in a bad mood, so the four of them stood in order in front of his table.A stack of memorials smashed straight at the four brothers, and Li Mingjin blocked it with his hand.Emperor Tiansheng scolded: \"You are still blocking it!\"Li Mingjin said bluntly: \"Back to the father, Er chen just got married, and he doesn't want to be embarrassed in front of the wife.\"[Er chen \"\u513f \u81e3\"; \u00e9r = the son; Chen = state official or subject in dynastic China; I, your servant (used in addressing the sovereign)]\"Sit down.\"Li Mingjin was given a seat in disguise and sat down carelessly.Emperor Tiansheng turned his anger towards the crown prince and the first prince, he smashed the memorial at his hand to the two of them, and the two didn't dare to hide.After the first prince was smashed, his face hurt even more, and he quickly said: \"Father, please calm down! Father!\"Hearing the father angrily scolding the first prince for going to the huakui competition and hurting himself, he also scolded the crown prince for even counting the bill. It was unclear, Li Mingjin was in a good mood, until he turned his head and saw the fourth brother Li Mingchun, who was quietly standing aside and unaffected, evoked an imperceptible mockery.Suddenly he remembered that the fourth brother had been following the first brother all the time. If the group of Jiangyang bandits who hadn't been killed was in his protection, wouldn't he pretend to be harmless to humans and animals in the past?If it was true, then he had to re-examine Li Mingchun.A good one, pretended to be a pig and ate a tiger.The author has something to say:The third Prince: Wife, everyone knows about me seven times a night, one hour at a time!Luo Shuyu:\u00a0 \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He and Li Mingjin had to go to the palace to attend a family banquet. Before that, they had to arrange the mansion. When the master's family celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival, the servants also had to live, and various expenses would increase.Every year on the Mid-Autumn Festival, the whole Daxia country was very lively. On this day, all officials had a day off to reunite with their families at home.In the palace, family banquet was also held every year, and musicians were invited to accompany it with elegant music.The Emperor Tiansheng would accompany the queen, the concubines and his childrens to appreciate the moon. He was a person who liked to enjoy the beauty, and he would set off fireworks in the garden of the palace every year. In the last life, when Luo Shuyu entered the palace to attend a banquet, what he looked forward to the\u00a0 most was watching the fireworks. He liked to see the bright sparkles in the dark night, it was very beautiful.There was a banquet in the palace, but he still needed to arrange the mansion. Luo Shuyu also took over the affairs of the mansion for the first time. Steward Sun didn't dare to neglect him. He would help him in time.After Luo Shuyu returned to the familiar Third Prince's Mansion, the smile on his face also increased, and he looked forward for the future, and hoped that this life would have different ending.There were lanterns everywhere in the mansion, the red lanterns that hung up when he married Li Mingjin didn't need to be taken off. They could be used directly during the Mid-Autumn Festival. They were still beaming and comfortable to watch.When Li Mingjin came back from the palace, it was already afternoon. Luo Shuyu rested on the couch. After he entered the yard, he handed the crutches to the servants. He jumped to the couch and sat down, pulled the quilt for Luo Shuyu.When Li Mingjin saw Luo Shuyu's hand on the quilt, his face became hot, and he thought of last night.He really didn't expect Luo Shuyu to help him, which was surprising.Perhaps it was his big man who was here, and Luo Shuyu felt something and woke up.Just as his eyes opened, he called him: \"Your Highness?\"Li Mingjin's face suddenly tightened: \"Are you still sleepy?\"\"I'm not sleepy anymore, I'll get up now.\" Luo Shuyu rubbed his eyes.At this time, Luo Shuyu was simply cute in Li Mingjin's eyes, and he couldn't help lowering his head and kissed his cheek.Luo Shuyu was stunned for a moment when he was suddenly kissed by him. This was experience he never had before, and he hadn't experienced it in the past few days. Suddenly, he realized the sweetness became Li Mingjin's imperial concubine, and his heart was filled with warmth.He thought that he liked physical contact with Li Mingjin, which was a good start, and neither of them rejected each other.When Li Mingjin came back, he found that the servants in the house were busy. Everywhere he went, he saw someone cleaning.\"You asked someone to clean it today?\"Luo Shuyu got up and mentioned what he was busy in the morning: \"Tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival, this is the first Mid-Autumn Festival we spend together, I asked the kitchen to prepare moon cakes, tomorrow night we will be able to enjoy the moon together.\"Li Mingjin: \"Tomorrow we have to enter the palace, I don't know if we can come back earlier.\"Luo Shuyu: \"I heard from mother that we can come back, and we can continue to enjoy the moon after returning.\"Li Mingjin: \"Then let's try to come back as early as possible, we may not be able to eat anything delicious there, so let's have a meal when we get home.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Yeah.\"For all the Mid-Autumn Festivals in the past life, they went back to their respective rooms after entering the palace. They never discussed what to do after returning before going out like this.Although Luo Shuyu was busy with the Mid-Autumn Festival, he didn't miss the follow-up to know about the huakui competition, and Ansan came back in the afternoon to report the matter.At this time, the two didn't go to the study, but sat on the small couch while eating the cakes and talking.This Shen Mingyun was somewhat capable, the first prince was injured, the bosses behind him left the yamen unharmed, and they were going to continue to hold the huakui competition on the Mid-Autumn Festival tomorrow.Luo Shuyu was very surprised: \"His Royal Highness, the first prince doesn't mind?\"Li Mingjin explained to him: \"I told you that you can't kill with a stick. The eldest brother took out some silvers to\u00a0 vote in this huakui competition. He doesn't like to suffer. No matter what, he won't let himself lose.\"Luo Shuyu: \"But after all, he still suffered a skin injury, so he still endures it?\"Li Mingjin: \"The matter of his skin injury was suppressed by him. When we were in the imperial study today, the father emperor didn't know about the grudge between him and the assassins, and only scolded him for not doing his job properly.\"His eldest brother bribed the few ignorant noble childrens who heard him talked to the assassins.Luo Shuyu: \"Then you still got a few words from the father emperor.\" You are also quite unprofessional.Li Mingjin patted his leg and said a little proudly: \"Of course not, you have to trust your husband.\"Luo Shuyu pierced him mercilessly: \"You just got married, your leg is still hurt, and you don't have any important cases in your hands, naturally you won't get scolded.\"Li Mingjin: \"Yu'er, you don't need to know me so well.\" He still wanted a face.Luo Shuyu smiled, and brought the topic back to the huakui competition: \"Won't it attract a lot of people if they continue the huakui competition on the Mid-Autumn Festival?\"During the Mid-autumn Festival in Daxia, Yunsheng Street was bustling with people next to each other. No curfew would be imposed on this night, and shops could open as long as they wanted, such as rouge shops, snack stalls, and juggling performances.Li Mingjin said truthfully: \"There will be a lot of people.\"Luo Shuyu: \"The last time the performance was suspended, I believe that this time Shen Mingyun and others will send people to watch in advance, and the performance venue will also strictly screened the flow of people entering and leaving, then how can we stop it, is there no way to do it once and for all? If there is another trouble, it will be easy to trample and hurt people this time.\"Li Mingjin said: \"Don't worry, we have a solution.\"Luo Shuyu: \"What is it?\"Li Mingjin licked the corner of his mouth, giving him a suggestive look.Luo Shuyu: \"...\" It was better to pretend that you didn't see it, this day and night he was always thinking about this kind of thing.Seeing that he didn't speak, Li Mingjin became anxious: \"You don't want to know anymore?\"Luo Shuyu took a sip of tea and covered the smile on his lips: \"Hey, I suddenly don't want to know, I'll know tomorrow, and it will be fine to know later.\"Li Mingjin thought that he was at a loss, he should ask directly instead of suggesting, his wife was too smart to fall into his trap.However, Li Mingjin didn't lose at all,\u00a0 when they took a break at night, Luo Shuyu's hands were sore for a long time, and then he fell asleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if today was the Mid-Autumn Festival reunion banquet, they had to follow the royal rules. Luo Shuyu was already used to it, and he didn't say much. He even hung the jade pendant he chose for Li Mingjin.Li Mingjin was a little suspicious: \"The jade pendant really matches me, Yu'er has a good eye.\"Luo Shuyu took pleasure in puncturing him: \"This jade pendant you wore it the day before yesterday.\"Li Mingjin: \"...\"The husbands were about to leave the house. Ansan dressed as a bodyguard was on the side today. Before Li Mingjin got into the carriage, he quietly whispered something to Li Mingjin. As soon as the words fell, Li Mingjin's eyes darkened: \"How dare you deceive like this, the murderer should pay with their\u00a0 life, go,\u00a0 do it.\"Ansan nodded, quietly retreated to the back, and after explaining a few words to the other guard, he returned to the side of the carriage and continued to be the guard.Luo Shuyu got into the carriage first, and was about to help Li Mingjin got into the carriage, but saw that his expression was not right: \"His Royal Highness, what's the matter?\"The two of them went out happily just now, but he suddenly became angry, \"Get on the carriage first.\"Li Mingjin was reluctant to tell Luo Shuyu about this. Luo Shuyu was not in a hurry: \"Okay.\"After getting into the carriage, Li Mingjin cut his tail, he told him about Luo Renshou arranged Liu Shi pretended to have serious illness, and then sent her to the nunnery. Luo Shuyu didn't suspect him, and he was relieved to hear that Luo Renshou sent Liu Shi to the nunnery. He also thought about taking Liu Shi's life, but instead of letting her die, it would be better to let her live in the nunnery to suffer. However, he didn't know how simple his idea was.Luo Renshou's promised to him was just a plan to delay. In the end, it was up to him whether to implement it or not. This was why he insisted on taking the initiative to deal with this matter. After all, Liu Shi was the biological mother of his two eldest sons. If he sent Liu Shi to the nunnery, his two sons would be separated from him in the future.What passed on to Li Mingjin was the news of how Luo Renshou dealt with Liu Shi.It was inevitable that Liu Shi couldn't stay in Luofu, but Luo Renshou wouldn't send her to the nunnery because of the fact that she had four childrens for him, but found someone who looked like Liu Shi. He was betting that Luo Shuyu wouldn't go to the nunnery to confirm, and that Luo Shuyu wouldn't be favored by Li Mingjin.But he was wrong, Li Mingjin had already put Luo Shuyu on the top of his heart, and he had long been eyeing Liu Shi, the murderer.Since she wanted to use the Mid-Autumn Festival to stay away from the capital and went to Luofu's hometown for the rest of her life, just let her go. Whether she could reach the hometown alive was unknown. It was also common sense to encounter a bandit on the road. The \"real\" Liu Shi in the nunnery in the south of the city, who would know that an unknown woman died on the road, even if Luo Renshou wanted to investigate the bandits, he wouldn't dare, and even more wouldn't dare to find Luo Shuyu, this bitter fruit could only be swallowed by himself!Honestly sending Liu Shi to the nunnery would at least save her small life, and he could only blame himself for being smart.Luo Shuyu didn't know anything about another plan in Li Mingjin's mind, and Li Mingjin never let him know about it from beginning to end.They went out early and bypassed Yunsheng Street today, arrived a little later than expected.They also met Li Mingchun, the fourth prince who was still alone. It was this season, and he was still using a fan.Thinking about it, he didn't become the first prince's attendant today.Seeing Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu, Li Mingchun walked over directly: \"Third brother, why did you come later than me?\"The Third Prince's Mansion was closer than the Fourth Prince's Mansion, so he should have arrived earlier than him. Li Mingjin said, \"Walk around. Just a little way.\"The fourth prince looked at Luo Shuyu again: \"Third sister in law.\"Luo Shuyu supported Li Mingjin, nodded, and didn't return the salute.The fourth prince didn't think too much about it, but Luo Shuyu really didn't want it. This man had a deep mind, and he didn't know what kind of bad water in his belly.They went directly to the Zhaoren Hall. The banquet table was already prepared in the palace. The lanterns were hung everywhere, very bright, like the daytime. Now they were just waiting for the princes and their concubines to take their seats.The Daxia Kingdom was relatively tolerant in terms of rules. Today, there would be concubines in the harem. All the banquet tables and tableware had been allocated.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin became the focus as soon as they came in, and the palace concubines all looked at Luo Shuyu with different expressions.Luo Shuyu, who attended the palace banquet for the first time in his last life, had never seen many big scenes, and his eyes were easy to show timidity, but now he had been training for many years, and his mentality was different from before.Passing by the position of Concubine Mei, Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu called her mother concubine at the same time, and Concubine Mei said casually: \"You will go back later, I'll ask eunuch Ping to bring you some newly mature vegetables.\"Li Mingjin looked at Luo Shuyu with a cold face, and Luo Shuyu immediately said to Concubine Mei, \"Thank you, mother concubine, we will definitely bring it.\"The two took their seats.On their left was the first prince, and on their right was the fourth prince. The crown prince and crown princess were close to the throne of Emperor Tiansheng, but there was still a certain distance.Sitting across from them were the four concubines, Concubine Lin Gui, the biological mother of the first prince, Concubine Jiang Shu, Concubine De, and Concubine Wei Xian, who entered the palace as a ger.At this time, before You Shi, there was still some time before Emperor Tiansheng and the queen took their seats.[y\u01d2u sh\u00ed = 5-7 pm (in the system of two-hour subdivisions used in former times)]Several sister in laws began to chat with Luo Shuyu every now and then. Today, the crown princess who was wearing makeup asked him with a smile, \"I heard that the third sister in law has been reading poetry and books since childhood. If he wasn't born as a ger, he would definitely be able to win the first prize in the imperial examination.\"The crown princess' words were not so pleasant to hear.What Luo Shuyu disliked the most in his last life was that she always spoke with a little bit of arrogance.He wasn't afraid, as long as the crown prince didn't inherit the throne for one day, the crown princess wouldn't be able to become the queen.Luo Shuyu replied: \"Where did the Crown Princess hear it? It's all rumors in the market. Shuyu just learned a little bit of zither, chess, calligraphy and painting. They are all fur, and they are not as good as the Crown Princess.\"The First imperial concubine also added to theirs chatting: \"Indeed, the Crown Princess is so beautiful that even the Queen praised her.\"The Crown Princess laughed twice, but she didn't expect that her sister in law would actually help Luo Shuyu.The battle between the three had just begun. The Crown Princess had always been unwilling to admit defeat: \"Now the banquet hasn't yet started, why don't we play a game?\" She turned and asked the Crown Prince beside her, \"His Royal Highness, what do you think?\"It was for the Crown Princess, and he said, \"Yes, there are many people and it's lively.\"A slyness flashed in the Crown Princess's eyes: \"Recently, there is a very interesting game, and it will lively when you play it with many people. You must never played it before.\"Someone asked curiously: \"Oh? What game is it?\"The Crown Princess said, \"It's getting dark, please close your eyes.\"Everyone thought it was interesting, and they all said they wanted to play together.It's getting dark, please close your eyes was a party game that Shen Mingyun copied from his world. It became popular recently. Luo Shuyu never attended a party since his rebirth. Naturally, he didn't think of these little things, but now he did.Li Mingjin asked Luo Shuyu: \"How, do you know how to play?\"According to the circumstances of Luo Shuyu's life, he shouldn't hear of this game. He pretended to be worried and whispered back to Li Mingjin: \"I haven't heard it.\"Li Mingjin's eyes lit up: \"It's okay, I'll teach you.\"Luo Shuyu gave him a meaningful look.He played it with him when he was pregnant with a child in his last life, and the process was indescribable.Because Li Mingjin could change his identity in every game.The author has something to say: This is a loose royal family dinner.The Third Prince: Wife, tonight I'm going to turn into a werewolf, oh~~Luo Shuyu: ...Go away!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This game had another name, called kill the werewolf.At first, Shen Mingyun was too lazy to just follow his modern kill the werewolf game, but later he found that the word kill was too taboo, so the name was changed to \"Please close your eyes when it's dark\". It was very suitable for party and helped to drive the atmosphere.Luo Shuyu thought to himself, only this game was worth playing without destroying someone's future and family.Everyone said that it was a new game and they didn't know how to play it, but almost everyone knew the rules.Since it was proposed by the Crown Prince and the Crown Princess, everyone gave a lot of respect, especially the First Prince, thinking that he would be able to make a comeback in the game later.The ten people in the game became the crown prince, the crown princess, the first prince, the the first prince's imperial concubine, Li Mingjin, Luo Shuyu, the fourth prince, three minor princes, a total of ten people.Since kill the werewolf had been changed to Please close your eyes when it's dark, and the character's names on the cards had also been changed.Werewolf was replaced by thief, common people were replaced by commoners, witches were replaced by saints, hunters were replaced by catchers, and prophets were replaced by immortals.The servants who knew the rules of the game began to deal with the cards for them, a total of ten cards, three thieves, three commoners, one saint, one catcher, and one immortal.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin each got one, but neither of them showed the card to the other.The rules of the game were very simple. When speaking, anyone could reveal their identity or hid it.Luo Shuyu got a thief card, he quietly covered the card on the table, and the thief card was fun.The servant: \"Please close your eyes when it's dark. It's midnight, and the thieves suddenly appeared in Qingshan Town.\"Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin both closed their eyes at the same time.Chamberlain: \"Please open your eyes, please close your eyes. Thieves please open your eyes, please designate the person you want to bring back to the cottage tonight.Luo Shuyu opened his eyes, and he found the other two who got the thief cards. With the first princes's imperial concubine, he really didn't expect everyone to be so lucky.This was really fun and exciting.The crown princess didn't expect the game she arranged to be so dramatic, but the game had to go on, she pointed to one of the minor prince, Luo Shuyu and the the first princes's imperial concubine agreed, and it seemed that taking him away was the least suspenseful.The servant: \"Please confirm the three thieves who will be brought back to the cottage.\"The three of Luo Shuyu ordered.Next came the saint and the immortal. The saint had a bottle of antidote and a bottle of poison. You could only use one bottle at a time. The immortal could check the true identity of one of them every nightThe saint used the antidote last night, and no one was injured. Players were invited to express their views in turn, and the Crown Prince was invited to speak.The crown prince's goal was to point directly at the first prince: \"I am a commoner card. I think the first brother may be a member of the thieves. Since it's the saint uses the antidote, he must have taken someone away. Okay, that's it.\".Luo Shuyu thought to himself that The crown prince probably didn't really study the game, and as soon as he came up, he knew who to arrest.The first prince gave him a roll of the eyes: \"Why do you say that I'm a thief, where is the evidence? \"The Crown Prince: \"It's just playing games, first brother, it's not your turn to speak yet.\"The first prince ignored him, turned his face away with a snort, and told himself to abide by the rules of the game.The servants didn't dare to stop the two from attacking each other: \"... Next, I will ask the Crown Princess to speak.\"The Crown Princess: \"I'm also a commoner's card. I don't know anything, and there's too little informations so far.\"Finally it was his turn, the first prince: \"I think the crown prince is one of the thieves. It must be him. I will guess him in this game. Everyone should keep their eyes open. He will definitely be able to show the thief card.\"Luo Shuyu was thinking that the first prince was very professional even in his language, which was on par with the crown prince, this one also worked hard in private.The first prince's imperial concubine was not very interested, she was the same as the crown princess: \"Insufficient information, I'm a commoner.\"Next, it was Li Mingjin's turn to speak, he didn't attack anyone, and directly blew his identity: \"I'm a catcher, arrest the thieves quickly.\"According to the experience of the past life, Luo Shuyu didn't have to guess to know that what Li Mingjin said was true. He said that if he was the catcher, then he was the catcher, and when he was taken by a bandit at night or when he was selected as the thief, he could walk alone .It was Luo Shuyu's turn to speak. He said, \"I am an immortal. I found out the identity of the fourth brother last night. He is a bandit.\" Luo Shuyu voted for the fourth prince, and playing games couldn't stop him from wanting to kill the fourth prince.The fourth prince who really got the immortal card never thought that Luo Shuyu would suddenly come here: \"...\" He raised his eyebrows, did he directly expose his identity as a thief?The concubines who were paying attention to this side at this time became interested when they heard Luo Shuyu's speech!This new third imperial concubine is a bit powerful!His remarks successfully muddled the waters of the battle between the crown prince and the eldest prince. You must know that except for the commoner and the catcher who didn't know the truth, everyone else knew. Luo Shuyu was the bandit card, where was he the immortal card? !Kind of exciting!As expected of being able to marry into the royal family, this courage and wit were not comparable to ordinary people.Through the reactions of others around him, Li Mingjin noticed that something was wrong with his wife, but he supported him no matter what he did, just playing a game.On the contrary, the crown prince and the first prince faced each other tit-for-tat, and didn't notice the changes of the Emperor Tiansheng's concubines.The fourth prince spoke after Luo Shuyu.The fourth prince said unhurriedly: \"I'm the Immortal. Last night I checked my eldest brother. He is a commoner. The third sister in law must be a thief. If he is an Immortal, he won't point at me. I'm an immortal, please pay more attention to what the third sister in law said.\"The concubines: It's getting more and more interesting.Even Concubine Mei, who had never been involved in these activities, turned her attention.The speeches of the latter three young princes were relatively ordinary. Luo Shuyu was now trying to protect the identities of the crown prince and the first prince, and then confused the eyes of others.After one round of speeches, everyone voted.The Fourth Prince was the first to go out!Luo Shuyu was also surprised. After thinking about the game just started, it was estimated that there were not many people who could play trick now. Whoever he pointed to would become the object of suspicion, and it was preconceived.The fourth prince smiled helplessly, and said his last sentence: \"I still said that, the third sister in law is very suspicious, he is the thief, and I'm the real immortal.\"He really wanted to remind the first prince, but he had no reason to play the game again. Otherwise, the true identity of Luo Shuyu caould be determined from his speech, but everyone was more willing to believe in the sincere Luo Shuyu, not him. This was the fight.Next was the second game, and the one who out was a minor prince.Luo Shuyu enjoyed being an immortal, mainly supported by Li Mingjin, so he was less likely to be suspected. After all, in his eyes, his wife was playing for the first time. He was too simple and definitely wouldn't deceive others.The crown prince and the first prince continued to bite each other, and the two had more and more arguments. The scene was chaotic for a time, and until the third night, a thief card couldn't be identified.The Crown Prince: \"You must vote for Big Brother next.\"First Prince: \"I think it's you.\"With the two of them disrupting the game, The thieves finally won.When they turned over their cards, they discovered that the other party was in the same camp as themselves, and that the person beside them was the thieves.The crown princess, who wanted to win with the crown prince, laughed with the first imperial concubine regardless of the previous suspicions, but only for tonight.Li Mingjin took the initiative to turn over Luo Shuyu's card: \"...Immortal card?\"Luo Shuyu turned over Li Mingjin's card with a smile: \"His Royal Highness, soldiers never tire of cheating.\" Sure enough, he was the catcher card, and he was still the third prince who could reveal his identity the most.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He used the action of drinking tea to cover up the thoughts in his heart. A lively and lovely figure flashed in his mind. I don't know what he is doing now?When everyone was still reminiscing about the game just now, a loud voice sounded.\"A good soldier never tires of cheating, hahaha, your game is really interesting, and you can play two games with me when you have time.\"Hearing the voice, they knew that this was the Emperor Tiansheng, and he brought the queen to the table.In his eyes, this was a game worthy of promotion. The thieves catch the commoner, the catcher catches the thieves, the saint rescues the commoner, and the immortal guides the people in the world, which was interesting.Everyone stood up and saluted the Emperor Tiansheng. After the ceremony, the queen brought everyone and others to their seats, and then entered the feast.When the Emperor Tiansheng entered the feast, he first had a glass of wine with everyone for the annual Mid-Autumn Festival.The next step was to drink. Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin are newlyweds. After the first prince, they drank the wine for the\u00a0 Emperor Tiansheng. The Emperor Tiansheng remembered his words \"A soldier never tires of cheating\". No wonder he was in the palace yesterday and his third son wanted to block his face, this Luo scholar was really smart.There was also a banquet in the middle. Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu watched the show while eating. In front of outsiders, Li Mingjin was said that he was acting presumptuously, but etiquette was carved into his bones since he was a child. The crown prince and brothers ate and drank the wine together.He drank too much wine and ate less food. Luo Shuyu thought that fortunately, before going out, he asked the mansion to prepare wine and food in advance. It was fine, he could eat a few bites occasionally.Because it was a family banquet, there was no one to persuade him to drink, so Li Mingjin wasn't drunk.As soon as the Youshi time passed, the Emperor Tiansheng led them to the garden to watch today's fireworks, which was what Luo Shuyu looked forward to the most tonight.boom!The first fireworks burst into the air.Everyone's eyes turned to the suddenly bright night sky.Luo Shuyu looked up at the fireworks, while Li Mingjin looked at him sideways, thinking: It turns out that my wife likes watching the fireworks. In the future, I must hold a large-scale fireworks show for him on his birthday.Li Mingjin quietly held Luo Shuyu's hand: \"Yu'er.\"Luo Shuyu turned to look at Li Mingjin and asked, \"What?\"Li Mingjin: \"I like you.\"Bang Bang Bang!The sound of fireworks overwhelmed Li Mingjin's voice, and Luo Shuyu asked repeatedly: \"What did you say?\"Li Mingjin repeated: \"I said I like you.\"Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang!Luo Shuyu: \"Huh?\"Li Mingjin: \"...\" He shook his head in frustration.He changed his mind, he must not set off fireworks on his wife's birthday, delaying him to show his sincerity to his wife!The fireworks continued, Luo Shuyu turned his head and continued to watch the fireworks. At this time, the stars were shining brightly in the night sky, and there was a slight smile on his lips. He didn't hear Li Mingjin's voice clearly, but he could see the shape of his lips.You like me, and I like you too.When I'm sure I can live well in this life, I'll let you know.After the fireworks show in the palace ended, the princes who had their own palaces had to leave the palace and couldn't stay in the palace for the night.The third prince left the palace together, because Li Mingjin's foot hadn't healed yet, and now he couldn't ride a horse.If he couldn't ride, others didn't necessarily didn't ride. They saw the fourth prince riding a horse before them and disappeared.Li Mingjin began to be suspicious of Li Mingchun yesterday. Seeing his back in a hurry, he asked Luo Shuyu, \"What is the fourth brother doing in such a hurry?\"Luo Shuyu said, \"This Mid-Autumn Festival, there are also many women and gers who will be on the street.\"Li Mingjin: \"So, the fourth brother also wants to marry a wife, and I don't know which woman or ger he will marry.\"Luo Shuyu shook his head: \"If he has someone he likes, can he marry him?\"Li Mingjin: \"As long as the family background is innocent, it should be no problem to take a concubine. In the royal family, the prince rarely has the right to choose his own concubine. When I meet you, It's my luck.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Me too.\"After saying this, the temperature in the carriage was a little high for a while, and when they returned to the mansion, Li Mingjin's face was still tight.Back in the main courtyard, the lights were brightly lit, with small lanterns hanging in the courtyard, and rows of pinwheels moving with the wind, which were really beautiful.There was a table of served wine, dishes, freshly seasonal fruits, and moon cakes that must be eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival.Li Mingjin was very surprised, the expression on his face became blank. During the day, when he saw Luo Shuyu's command to move and lift, it turned out not only to make a table of dishes, but also unexpected arrangements.His wife was so caring.Luo Shuyu said, \"Your Highness, this is the first Mid-Autumn Festival we spent together.\" It won't be the last.Li Mingjin nodded, \"Yeah.\" When it came to the critical moment, he was always speechless and anxious.Luo Shuyu handed him a pair of chopsticks: \"Let's try this meat dish, whether it's delicious or not. The roast lamb was specially prepared by the kitchen today.\"After tasting it, Li Mingjin couldn't help nodding: \"Delicious.\"Sitting in the yard together to admire the moon, Li Mingjin admired the windmill being blown.When it was almost time to rest, Li Mingjin urged Luo Shuyu to go back to the room to rest.After getting on the bed, Luo Shuyu was kissed fiercely by Li Mingjin: \"It's my turn tonight.\"Luo Shuyu who was gagged: \"Huh?\"Li Mingjin bit his earlobe again and whispered, \"I'll mess with you.\"Luo Shuyu felt his hand on his private place: \"...\" It doesn't have to.The night life of the husbands in the Third Prince's Mansion had just begun.At the same time, an unexpected thing happened on Yunsheng Street.The huakui competition continued today at Youshi, and there weren't a lot of spectators. The guardrails that were damaged before were gone, and now they had been changed to artificial security.However, these bosses still underestimated the mentality of the common people to watch the fun. The more famous the huakui, the more people came to watch. When Liang Xian'er appeared on the stage, it reached the largest number of spectators at the huakui competition.Suddenly, someone at the scene started fighting because of discussing Liang Xian'er's appearance, and it was chaos again.Suddenly, someone shouted: \"Traffickers, there are traffickers, they took my son away!\"\"Help me!\"\"Who will help me find my child!\"\"My child is gone too!\"\"My God Ah, where is my child? Where are you Ergouzi?\"At this time, a beautiful young man and a few servants appeared in front of the man and asked him, \"This is your child?\"The man who found the child again: \"Yes, yes, he is my child!\"However, the child kept crying and didn't want to be hugged by the man at all, and the beautiful young man also signaled the servant to return the child to the man as soon as possible.He consciously did a good deed. When the man walked away with the child in his arms, the beautiful young man breathed a sigh of relief. He finally completed a task, and the made some mall coins.From a distance, He could hear a woman crying and screaming that she lost her child!Shen Mingyun looked at the tasks he had completed, and ignored it, there would be officials who would take care of it later.Seeing that the first round of the show was finally over, he wanted to take a good look at the night market in Beijing.He was wandering around and accidentally bumped into a man in white. The other person turned his head and smiled at him: \"Yeah, it's you.\"Shen Mingyun didn't find out whether Li Mingchun really met by chance or did it deliberately, but he certainly wouldn't think too much, everything must be a chance of encounter.He laughed very loudly: \"Fourth Prince? It's a coincidence, are you also visiting the night market?\"Li Mingchun handed him a mask in his hand: \"Of course, I just bought it, does it look good?\"Shen Mingyun took the mask: \"Good-looking, thank you.\" He thought that the fourth prince was worthy of being the male god in his mind, not to mention his looks, his voice was nice, and people were gentle.Suddenly, a carriage drove by and almost hit Shen Mingyun who was facing away from it. Li Mingchun quickly pulled Shen Mingyun into his arms: \"Mingyun, be careful!\"At this moment, Shen Mingyun felt that he became the heroine in the idol script. Is it the feeling of heartbeat?In all time travel dramas, the person who traveled must be the protagonist, and he thought he must be too.When Shen Mingyun smelled the light sandalwood scent on Li Mingchun's body and was thinking wildly, a playful look flashed in Li Mingchun's eyes.In the chaotic crowd just now, how did Shen Mingyun find that child?The author has something to say:The third prince: Wife, today I'm A, you are O, you are in the estrus period when you can't use inhibitors!Luo Shuyu: ...Go awayPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though guards were invited, many people went in and it was still crowded.According to Shen Mingyun's description, it was a proper star chasing scene.However, last night, Shen Mingyun thought that after Liang Xian'er appeared on the stage, there would be no more accidents, so he went to the night market with the fourth prince, and didn't see the end at the scene. He didn't know that Liang Xian'er's performance was too crowded by crazy people before the competition started. When she got on the stage, Liang Xian'er's well-designed performance clothes were almost torn off. Fortunately, the guards at the scene came quickly and escorted her to the backstage. Some of the guards used a lot of energy to disperse the crazy crowd.The huakui competition on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival was stopped at Liang Xian'er' turn.The two consecutive huakui competitions failed, and the bosses who partnered to invest the money were so anxious that their hair turned white and their mouths grew blisters!When the official side learned about this, they found that the huakui competition was a large gathering place, and because of the crowd, there was a big incident. Many childrens were kidnapped by kidnappers. On the second day of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the government received reports from dozens of people.After the incident was over, the governor of the capital immediately handed the report to the above!The huakui competition would definitely have a great impact on the stability of the capital, not only the people, but also the safety of Your Majesty. The relevant procedures for large- scale events were formulated. If you wanted to hold a large-scale competition of entertainment, it must be reported to the government, otherwise you couldn't obtain the qualification to hold the event!In less than two days, the above agreed to the proposal of the governor of the capital, and the above gave reasonable instructions. The governor was almost terrified, and the efficiency of the above was suddenly like a dream.On the third day after the end of the first phase of the huakui competition, a new decree was issued in the capital.[To hold large-scale events in the bustling areas of the capital, those with more than 50 people must report to the government in advance! \u3011Although Li Mingjin kept his feet at home, he could know what's going on without leaving home. He wasn't the crown prince or the first prince, and he didn't think that the Emperor Tiansheng wouldn't know their every move. This huge imperial city, the whole world. It was all in the hands of the Emperor Tiansheng, can he not know the movements of the people below?Moreover, the Emperor Tiansheng had a secret guard on his hand to help him. The crown prince and the first prince looked down on him. It was definitely not stupid to be able to win the world from the five princes back then. He would care more about power, and now, wanting to split power from the Emperor Tiansheng was equivalent to pull out a tiger's beard.Li Mingjin started to go to the court. He went to the Ministry of Punishment in the morning to fill the attendance, and came back to accompany Luo Shuyu in the afternoon. After three months of marriage leave, to save them from watching and worrying.After he went to the Ministry of Punishment today to fill the attendance, he personally went to the pastry shop to buy some sweet-scented osmanthus cakes for Luo Shuyu, and casually told him about the follow-up of the huakui competition. It was three days later, but his wife was not in a hurry.The two were eating sweet-scented osmanthus cakes and some dried fruits in the pavilion. They were all collected by Li Mingjin for Luo Shuyu's cravings , not for himself. After all, he loved food with meat.Luo Shuyu knew that the huakui competition had collapsed at the door, and didn't know what to do next.Sat across from him, Li Mingjin tore the beef jerky into strips and stuffed it into his mouth, explaining the new law to Luo Shuyu.Luo Shuyu really didn't expect that Li Mingjin could still think of this method, using official means to directly target Shen Mingyun, which was very reasonable.If it was in Shen Mingyun's world, it was really not feasible to directly take the law, after all, the situation in the country was different.Luo Shuyu thought about it for a while and said : \"After the decree came out, this huakui competition didn't seem to be banned, but in fact it was slowly draining everyone's enthusiasm for it.\"Li Mingjin said: \"Yes, and the approval process is still fast for the time being. This will involve several departments, and the governor of the capital will also send people to watch.\"\"But then, if we hold some meaningful activities, won't it take a long time?\"\"The decree is clear, it's stipulated that the application process for non-entertainment competitions will be simpler. For example, the martial arts arena, large-scale literati poetry competitions, and cooking competitions all involve individual recipes that only need to be reported, while the huakui competition that involved nearly thousand people planned by Shen Mingyun will take a longer time.\"Thinking about it, it would be impossible for Shen Mingyun to gain gold every day during the huakui competition as he did in the previous life.Luo Shuyu: \"Your Highness, isn't the decree more than this?\"Li Mingjin: \"Of course, there are many details in it, all of which were finalized in advance.\"\"As a result, Shen Mingyun's huakui competition can't go on.\" If you drag it later, the expectations of the audience would be lower. Over the time, everyone would lose their freshness. The first issue had came out, and all the huakui had finished their appearances, and there were no hooks. He couldn't help complimenting Li Mingjin, \"It's still Your Highness's clever trick, and he won't be criticized.\"Li Mingjin raised his eyelids: \"Then do you know whose team the governor of the capital is currently on?\"\"Crown prince?\" Luo Shuyu asked uncertainly. \"Only he can fight against the first prince at present, and the father emperor won't prevent the crown prince from issuing this decree.\"After all, the crown prince was the one who was told by the ancestors to inherit the orthodox throne, and he could rectify it for better security in the capital. The Emperor Tiansheng would definitely support him, and this was also related to the safety of the imperial city. How can the Emperor Tiansheng's territory allow others to sleep soundly?.Luo Shuyu really admired Li Mingjin. He not only had a brain, but also had a lot of courage. These things were given to the crown prince were enough to make the Emperor Tiansheng changed his mind, but he chose to give it away for free.Today, he knew that what he married was a treasure, his treasure, and this was the real third prince himself.\"Smart, I will reward you with a piece of cake.\" Li Mingjin personally brought the cake to Luo Shuyu's mouth.Luo Shuyu: \"...\" On purpose, knowing that he could guess,Feeding his wife the cakes was a fun thing, Li Mingjin watched Luo Shuyu finished one piece, and then handed the next piece to his lips: \"One more bite?\"Luo Shuyu satisfied his desire to feed people, he opened his mouth and ate another piece.When he reacted again, Luo Shuyu had already swallowed three pieces of cakes, and Li Mingjin was about to feed him the fourth piece. Fortunately, he stopped him quickly. He was not a pig.Li Mingjin felt extremely regretful that he couldn't continue to feed his wife the cakes.The huakui 101 issue was more than half solved by Li Mingjin, and he still had a question he wanted to ask.\"By the way, Your Highness, did you find the lost child that night on the Mid-Autumn Festival?\" He was also someone who had a child before. He felt the pain of losing a child, and could understand the heartbreak of losing a child.Li Mingjin said: \"Since I found it, I sent people to watch it in advance that day, and there were already people watching the kidnappers from the government side. I followed the vine and found the kidnapper's den. In the end, they caught and rescued more than 40 childrens, some of whom were kidnapped that night, and some were kidnapped from another place.\"Luo Shuyu said with emotion: \"Aren't those children unable to find their parents?\"Li Mingjin nodded: \"Yu'er don't have to worry, they are temporarily placed in Fuxinfang, and the imperial court will regularly allocate money there.\"When Luo Shuyu mentioned these lonely children, Luo Shuyu reluctantly thought of his previous life, and his heart was in a mess, and his eyes didn't know why it turned red.Li Mingjin was so frightened that he was at a loss: \"Did I say something wrong? I apologize.\"Once he drank with a certain general, he said that when his wife was angry or cried, it was right to apologize first, and if it was useless, he would kneel down. It would be fine!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After so many years alone, I feel a little emotional. Your Highness, why don't we send someone to buy some clothes and foods and send it to Fuxinfang, it\u2019s almost winter, I\u2019m afraid they won\u2019t be able to survive.\u201dShen Mingyun disliked them, ancient people. They full of hope, but in terms of the child\u2019s survival, it was really low, and if they got sick, they may be die. Once, Shen Mingyun mentioned that the medical level in ancient times was really poor, and he also disliked that he couldn't replace a bowl of medicine soup with a bean-sized pill to cure all diseases. Therefore, Luo Shuyu thought about doing his best to keep those children who might not be able to find their parents to live as much as possible.Li Mingjin was afraid that he would cry, so he held his hand and said, \"There is a maple forest in Fuxinfang. We can go there to enjoy the maple leaves in a while and take a look at those children, okay?\"\"Okay.\" Luo Shuyu said well, he also wanted to go out for a walk, but not now, Li Mingjin's legs were not fully healed. Beside, the human trafficker thing had just passed, and it would make the crown prince or the first\u00a0 prince suspicious.Li Mingjin thought to himself that his wife was not only very soft-hearted, but also loved to cry.Luo Shuyu didn't know that he was a crybaby in Li Mingjin's heart.The sun went down, and the two were about to return to the main courtyard. At this time steward Sun brought someone, he should be the eunuch in the palace.The eunuch saluted the two of them and reported: \"I have seen His Royal Highness the Third Prince and the Third Prince's Imperial Concubine. The Crown Princess will hold an autumn chrysanthemum viewing soon. This is an invitation to the Third Prince's Imperial Concubine.\"The Mid-Autumn Festival just passed, The Crown Princess invited him to appreciate the chrysanthemum, which seemed very interesting.Luo Shuyu opened the invitation, looked at the time and place, and probably knew why she was hosting this chrysanthemum banquet.In his previous life, he just accused of marriage, and he never went to this chrysanthemum viewing banquet by the Liu family. After reading the book, he realized that Shen Mingyun once again shined brightly at this chrysanthemum viewing banquet.The chrysanthemum banquet was not just for fun, appreciating chrysanthemums, eating, drinking, and playing. The princess had another purpose.Hearing that the prince didn't have any children yet, the queen was very anxious. The crown prince and the crown princess indeed repeatedly asked the imperial doctor about how to have a child. Now, this responsibility fell on the crown princess. She looked beautiful on the surface, she was also considered to get the crown prince's favor, but there was no movement in her belly. She was also wronged in this regard, but no matter how wronged she was, it was useless. She could only set up a chrysanthemum banquet according to the queen's instructions, and invited women or gers of innocent families to come to the scene to replace the crown prince to chose concubine.The bright side was to appreciate chrysanthemums, but in fact it was to choose people.After the eunuch of the East Palace left, Luo Shuyu sent someone to inquire whether the unmarried young ladies and young masters of the Luo residence received the invitations from the crown\u00a0 princess.In the evening, he knew that all the young ladies and gers of the right age in Luo Mansion was invited. Because Liu Shi was \"seriously ill\", the invitation was in the hands of the old lady, and she would lead those people there.It seemed that the old lady knew the purpose of this chrysanthemum banquet, and who wanted to be sent to the Crown Prince's Mansion to be a concubine?After Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin took a bath, they sat on the couch and played chess before it was time to rest.Seeing Luo Shuyu frowning, Li Mingjin didn't think he was thinking\u00a0 about the chess game, and he was holding white chess piece in a daze. Li Mingjin poked at his slightly bulging cheek: \"What are you thinking?\"Luo Shuyu touched his face: \"I'm thinking about the chrysanthemum banquet in three days.\"Li Mingjin: \"What?\"Luo Shuyu: \"I'm guessing that the crown princess wants to choose a good wife for the crown prince.\"Li Mingjin: \"In the past, you didn't saw the crown prince more than when I saw him . How do you decide that he is anxious about the heir?\"Luo Shuyu: \"The crown prince is not in a hurry, but some people were more anxious than the crown prince, otherwise why would they appreciate chrysanthemums at this season, and most of the invitations are for unmarried women and gers in the capital.\"Now all the people in the capital who could be named were on the list of crown princess.Li Mingjin: \"Why do you care about this? The crown prince finds concubine is normal.\"Luo Shuyu said: \"But all of the three candidates from Luofu are invited, including Shen Mingyun.\"In the book, how did Shen Mingyun meet the crown prince? How did the crown prince develop a favorable impression of Shen Mingyun? It was in this chrysanthemum banquet.What did Shen Mingyun do at that time to attract the attention of the crown prince who was passing by the banquet?According to the book, he talked eloquently in front of hundreds of pots of chrysanthemums at that time.After that day, Shen Mingyun became famous again in the capital, and even the crown prince looked at him highly. The crown prince had the idea of accepting him, but at this time, Shen Mingyun was already a little famous, and the first, the fourth prince wouldn't agree. In short, Shen Mingyun used another trick to escape the catastrophe of becoming crown prince's concubine.And now, if Shen Mingyun go to the Chrysanthemum Banquet again, will he still be favored by the Crown Prince?Li Mingjin didn't care much about this: \"What if he go, you forgot, what he did at the poetry meeting of Luo Shumo and Luo Shuhan last time, he copied Li Bai's poems.\"\"Yes.\" Luo Shuyu remembered that it was the first time he met Li Mingjin after his rebirth that day.It was night, when the two fell asleep, Luo Shuyu was pressed down by Li Mingjin and was almost breathless, and his hand was placed in a particularly sensitive place again!Li Mingjin leaned against his earlobe and said in a deep voice, \"Don't forget the day when you and I first met.\"Luo Shuyu begged with a warm face: \"Your Highness, I will remember, you don't...\".Youyou Xiaozhu.Shen Mingyun bent one leg and stepped on the chair and ate a chicken leg in a big mouth. His mouth was oily, and he scolded the system in his mind: \"Fuck! The person who issued the regulation on crowd gathering management is an idiot, right? Look at me! How can I collect money if the huakui 101 doesn't run continuously? When will this application be applied? Is the official's work quicker? It will be over after a month or two! The regulation was created by the crown prince? System, can you make a deal with the crown prince?\"The system replied: \"No, if the host fails to complete the task within the time limit, the task will be regarded as a failure.\"Shen Mingyun: \"Rely on, but at least I still earned money a bit.\"The system: \"After deducting the cost of the huakui's appearance fee and various expenses, the host didn't successfully earn a penny, but did a loss-making business.\"Shen Mingyun: \"...\" So he still posted it backwards?At this time, the person beside him said, \"Gongzi, the old lady sent someone over to spread the words and asked you to stay in the mansion for the past two days. In a few days, you will go to the Crown Princess's Chrysanthemum Appreciation Banquet.\"Shen Mingyun threw the chicken thigh bones on the table: \"What's the point of watching the chrysanthemum banquet? What can you enjoy in a pot of chrysanthemum?\"The person beside him said, \"No, gongzi, it's more than a few of potted plants. I heard that those chrysanthemums were planted before autumn, and the chrysanthemums bloom in pieces, and they are beautiful!\"Shen Mingyun was a little interested: \" Oh? Then I'll go take a look.\"At the same time, Shen Mingyun received another system task.[Task reminder: Please become friends with the Crown Princess and gain her trust. \u3011Shen Mingyun said in disbelief: \"Her husband has messed with me, so I still want to be her friend? My brain got shit?\"The system in his mind: ...The author has something to say:The third Prince: What I touched is here? Still here?Luo Shuyu: Go away~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was the first time he received an invitation to go out.Today's Li Mingjin was particularly worried, for fear that Luo Shuyu would be bullied by the Crown Princess and those who didn't have long eyes. From waking up in the morning, he looked completely absent-minded, and the Emperor Tiansheng, who was sitting above, glanced at him several times.After went out from the court, he hurriedly went back to the mansion, hoping that Luo Shuyu hadn't gone out yet, and he could look at his wife more today.Back to the mansion, Li Mingjin found that Luo Shuyu hadn't gone out yet and was changing clothes in the bedroom.Li Mingjin hugged him from behind: \"I'll pick it out for you.\"Luo Shuyu was taken aback by his sudden action, the maid next to him covered their mouths and smiled, Luo Shuyu patted Li Mingjin behind him.Li Mingjin drove them out, hugged Luo Shuyu and took a few mouthfuls, and let him go until Luo Shuyu was panting slightly.For the occasion, Li Mingjin chose a chrysanthemum pattern hosta for Luo Shuyu, jade pendantengraved with a chrysanthemum pattern .Luo Shuyu asked him, \"Your Highness, won't it look bad if I put so many chrysanthemum patterns on my body?\"He remembered that Shen Mingyun's system provided him with a fashion matching magazine, and it was written in the book that if the matching of clothing and accessories exceeds three, one of them should be concise and not too complicated.Li Mingjin picked up a blue satin sachet from the basket: \"Not much, let's add a sachet with a chrysanthemum pattern.\"Luo Shuyu looked at Li Mingjin clumsily tying the sachet for him, and smiled: \"Why all of them are\u00a0 chrysanthemum?\"Li Mingjin half-squatted and said, \"Nothing.\" If the chrysanthemum banquet didn't wear chrysanthemum patterns, it wasn't brilliant, his wife should be the best.A series of praise hit Luo Shuyu: \"My person should be the best looking one at the banquet.\"Luo Shuyu laughed: \"You think too much.\" He turned to ask the person, \"what time is it now? It's time to go\".The distance was a bit long, and Luo Shuyu had to go half an hour earlier.Li Mingjin and him hardly separated since they got married. Today, they had to be separated for a whole day. Suddenly, he wanted to send Luo Shuyu out, and he felt a little bit reluctant. It seemed that he understood why Luo Shuyu always stood there for a long time when he sent him out before going back.\u00a0 He told him not to stand for too long several times, but he didn't listen. Now that it was his turn, he seemed to be able to understand what he was doing, because it was reluctance to part, extremely reluctant.Li Mingjin not only personally sent Luo Shuyu to the carriage, but also sent him more people, for fear that he would be bullied.Li Mingjin said a few more words: \"You'll be back when it's time to go back. It gets dark quickly in autumn, and it's hard to walk when it's late.\"Luo Shuyu nodded while hooking the curtain of the carriage: \"I know, it won't be too late, don't give it away. I'm here, the guards are here, I'll be fine.\"He got out of the carriage, after thinking of something, \"Your Highness, come here.\"Luo Shuyu straightened Li Mingjin's hair crown, Li Mingjin leaned forward, only to see Luo Shuyu held a light blue colored sachet out of nowhere, it was dexterously hung on Li Mingjin's waist. If there was a difference, the pattern on it was rather unusual. He guessed that Luo Shuyu embroidered it himself, and shook Luo Shuyu's hand: \"You do a good job of embroidering this little daisy.\"Luo Shuyu twitched the corners of his mouth and looked at him fixedly: \"I embroidered bamboo leaves.\"Li Mingjin: \"...Well, it looks good.\" It turns out that my wife's embroidery skills are so unusual .Luo Shuyu didn't force him to open his eyes and talked nonsense. Whoever had no shortcomings, he just didn't know how to do it. If it wasn't for Li Mingjin, he would never do embroider in his life.\"I'm leaving.\" Luo Shuyu couldn't continue to talk to Li Mingjin any longer, otherwise it would really get dark later.\"Go, be careful on the road.\" Li Mingjin nodded, and when Luo Shuyu's carriage disappeared around the corner, he was still standing at the gate of the Third Prince's Mansion, with the intention of looking after the husband.For the first time, Luo Shuyu was watched away by Li Mingjin. Everything he saw along the way felt beautiful, and even when he looked at the little wild flowers on the roadside he felt very happy.The crown princess' chrysanthemum banquet wasn't held in the East Palace, but chose a courtyard in the name of the crown prince.When he arrived at the gate of the courtyard, he found that there were rows of carriages parked outside. Luo Shuyu was riding in a carriage marked by the Third Prince's Mansion. As soon as he appeared, the eunuch shouted, \"The Third Prince Imperial Concubine is here!\"He was led into the mansion.Before the fall, the Crown Princess ordered no less than 200 kinds of chrysanthemums to be planted here. Luo Shuyu and others should be able to see 220 kinds of chrysanthemums here today.From the moment you entered the door, you could see that the yard was full of chrysanthemums of different varieties. Whether you were interested in chrysanthemums or not, you would be attracted by this magnificent scenery and stop for these different delicate flowers.In addition to appreciating chrysanthemums, today\u2019s dishes was also related to chrysanthemums, including chrysanthemum tea, chrysanthemum wine, chrysanthemum syrup, chrysanthemum cakes, etc. A variety of dishes with chrysanthemum as an accessory.Although he had never participated in this chrysanthemum viewing banquet in his last life, he also participated in various banquets held by others on weekdays. The process of the banquet was almost the same, but this time the purpose was relatively unusual, because the crown princess wanted to replace the crown prince to choose concubine.They didn't say it on the bright side, but all those who were willing to send their gers and daughters in after receiving the wind came. Those who didn't want to come wouldn't go out with their unmarried children. In fact, there were only two kinds of people she wanted, one was from a decent background, and the other was someone who looked to be able to give birth.Luo Shuyu didn't know how to distinguish whether someone could give birth or not. Although he had given birth, he was a ger, and he was different from a woman, and he didn't know much about it. It was estimated that a woman would be chosen this time. The ger's fertility rate was relatively low. There were also men in Daxia who\u00a0 married gers. They never had children in their entire lives, but they were all special cases. Basically, it wasn't a problem to have one or two.Luo Shuyu was not very interested in the princess's choice of girls who could or couldn't have children. He was attracted by the chrysanthemum gardens after he entered the courtyard.After watching it for a while, he said to Qingwang, \"If only His Highness could do it, too.\" Only when the two people who agreed with each other could appreciate the scenery together, the impression could be deepened.Qingwang said optimistically: \" Master will be able to enjoy chrysanthemums with His Royal Highness in the future, but you have to live a lifetime.\"Luo Shuyu strengthened his determination, and for this vision, he had to do well: \"Yes, we will definitely live a lifetime. \"Everything would go in the right direction.This was Luo Shuyu's first time to go out as the third prince's concubine. Many people had strong curiosity about him. Who didn't know what kind of reputation the third prince had? Before they got married, many people privately bet on the direct descendant of Luofu. How long the young master could stay in the Third Prince's Mansion, would he die before he even arrived at the Guining Day when he entered the mansion?But today they saw it and found that all their guesses were wrong!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Today, he was wearing the most popular new style in the capital, snow-white satin clothes, with silver chrysanthemum pattern on the robe, which complemented the suet jade hairpin on his head, plus with excellent appearance.Two women who admired chrysanthemum spoke in a low voice.\"I went to Luyingzhuang the day before yesterday, and when I saw this dress, I wanted to prepare a set for my family Ling'er. Who knew that the shopkeeper told me that there was only one in the whole capital, and it was made by the most powerful tailor in Luyingzhuang. Don't make the same for the second one! I was still thinking about who is so domineering and didn't let anyone make the same style. I never thought that it was ordered by the Third Prince's Mansion.\"\"Whether he ordered it or the third prince ordered it, did you find out?\"\"The third prince ordered it himself, and someone saw it.\"\"That rumor is not so credible, but can this third prince imperial concubine and the crown princess be friend?\"\"Today is the crown princess' banquet, do you think they agree to make friend?\"There were two or three figures around, and Luo Shuyu wasn't completely admiring the chrysanthemum, but first looked around to see if there were any three figures from Luofu.Soon he was led by the eunuch to the banquet place, and all who came were women and gers younger than Luo Shuyu.At this time, the position with the largest number of people was next to the first imperial concubine, and she had a great conversation with a group of ladies.On weekdays, these noble ladies often attended various banquets, and wherever there was a banquet, they would be there.Luo Shuyu knew a few of them, but that was in his previous life. In this life, he shouldn't know them yet.Before entering the The Third Prince's Mansion, he had only one reputation, and the Liu Shi seldom took him to the banquets.Of course, there was no need for him to get to know these people now, as long as one person knew that he was the third imperial concubine, everyone would know.As soon as he came, everyone stood up and saluted him, Luo Shuyu replied generously: \"All get up, no need to be too polite.\"In the eyes of many unmarried gers, Luo Shuyu's current identity was the goal of their efforts. He successfully married The third prince and raised the status of the gers in the capital. It was true that if they could enter the palace, it could only become the concubine, and when it came to the identity, the third prince's imperial concubine was more orthodox. If it was the third prince's turn to sit on the throne, then the third prince's imperial concubine was directly became the queen. In the rear position, how could the position of the imperial concubine be compared with the position in the rear.Luo Shuyu didn't care how the young gers and women around him spread their thoughts.He first greeted the first imperial concubine according to the etiquette. He didn't mean to flatter the first imperial concubine, but the first imperial concubine treated him surprisingly well. When he saw her, she smiled immediately, and looked like two people with the one who chatted with the ladies just now.\"Shuyu, come and sit here.\" This was the first time they spoke privately.They were not familiar with each other in the last life, and they didn't say much in the public, and they were all only polite greetings.But the current first imperial concubine wasn't the same as in the previous life, she was kind and polite to Luo Shuyu.Whether she was in good spirits, at a happy event or if they had other plans, it was still unknown.Luo Shuyu had no reason to reject the first imperial concubine kindness for the time being. If he wanted to learn some news from these wive in the future, he had to befriend with her.Compared with the crown princess, the first imperial concubine was actually more able to win people's hearts, and she married the first prince as the daughter of an official family. Unlike the crown princess, she followed her parents into the palace when she was a child, and she met the queen dowager and the queen. He also received the teachings of the harem. Her eyes were always above the top, and when she was a daughter, she was in a state of invincibility, and it wasn't necessary to say something when she was a crown princess now.Luo Shuyu: \"The First Sister in law.\"The First imperial concubine: \"You and I don't have a chance to talk. Next time I have a banquet, you have to be the first to arrive.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Okay, if the first Sister in law doesn't mind, I will bring my family to take breakfast with you. Is it early enough?\"The first imperial concubine said, \"Hahaha, you are, you are, come to my house to have breakfast, and I will make sure that you and the third brother are satisfied.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Then thank the first\u00a0 sister in law.\"The two sisters in law were talking, the other ladies naturally stepped aside, pretended to enjoy the scenery, but in fact secretly looked at the relationship between him and the first imperial concubine, Bi Ruoyao.Bi Ruoyao: \"Look at you so polite, I look at your Luofu, it seems someone is coming. It was brought by your grandmother, and they are resting in the back room.\"Luo Shuyu: \"I said I didn't see them when I came here.\"Bi Ruoyao: \"You don't have to go now, they will come to see you.\"Whose back house didn't have any intrigue, Luo Shuyu was pointed to the third prince as the son in law, and she knew about how the Luo family paid little attention to him, and others were still jealous of him. But Bi Ruoyao was not stupid, just guessing that Luo Shuyu and Madam Luo must have a bad relationship.In response to Bi Ruoyao's blunt remarks, Luo Shuyu just smiled: \"Even so, I still have to see my grandmother.\" Fame is still needed.Bi Ruoyao said \"kindly\": \"Then you have a cup of tea before you go, and the crown princess will come over later.\"Luo Shuyu thought about what she was thinking: \"Alright.\"If Bi Ruoyao didn't mention the old lady of the Luo family, he could pretend that he didn't know that Luofu also came, and now he had to go see them.No matter how enthusiastic Bi Ruoyao was, treating him like a real sister was a lie. Luo Shuyu wouldn't believe that she was sincere became his relative.To win over Li Mingjin? The first prince couldn't even pull it, and he couldn't let anyone rely on him (LMJ). That's all she wanted to do to block the crown princess. If the first prince couldn't get Li Mingjin's help, the crown prince couldn't even get it.They were all women with complicated minds, and they were more calculated than the ministers in the court.Luo Shuyu and Bi Ruoyao sat for a while. The crown princess didn't come, but Mrs. Luo came out first.When they saw Luo Shuyu, they came directly to salute. Luo Shuyu dodged and stood up to help the old lady. Although he was dragged by the first prince and didn't go in to see the old lady, he was well behaved in front of people and helped the old lady to sit down, it was in the eyes of people.Luo Shuyu heard Luo Shuyao muttering in a low voice: \"Fake.\"Luo Shuyu looked at him with a half-smile, and asked Luo Shuyao in a low voice, \"Do you want me to show you someone else?\"Luo Shuyue: \"Why did you talk to the third imperial concubine and you didn't kneel down for the third imperial concubine!\"Luo Shuyue kicked Luo Shuyao's back knee directly, Luo Shuyao rushed forward, but Luo Shuyu had already guarded Luo Shuyue , and directly half-squatted to support him, without letting him really kneel, he raised his voice: \"Fifth brother, what's wrong with you?\"He immediately said to the servant next to him, \"How do you serve the fifth gongzi, you don't even know when he is sick.\" He touched Luo Shuyao's forehead, \"It's getting hot, so why don't you hurry to find someone to call the doctor over?, Qingwang, help fifth gongzi to rest inside for a while, don't let him come out again\".Qingwang was stunned, but listening to his gongzi was right. He and an old maid immediately dragged Luo Shuyao. Luo Shuyao was dazed the whole time, and the old maid pressed his neck and didn't let him turn back.As for the frightened Luo Shuyue, her legs trembled and she stood back to behind the old lady. The old lady almost wanted to kill her with the crutches in her hand.So petty, couldn't get on the stage!A \"family affair\" that would have embarrassed Luo Shuyu was quickly resolved by him, and the vicious-eyed of the old lady was an eye-opener, and now she had a very good impression of Luo Shuyu.The old lady could only take the lead: \"Thanks to the third imperial concubine, it may be that Shuyao's child didn't pay attention to keep warm and contracted the cold. Later, he will be sent back to the mansion to recuperate.\"Luo Shuyu nodded: \"It's what the old lady thinks, it's thoughtful of you, it\u2019s okay to go back to the mansion to rest, I don\u2019t care, don\u2019t bump into the nobles in the future.\u201dThe old lady breathed a sigh of relief: \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThey just finished watching the excitement, and everyone was waiting for the crown princess to show up. However, at this moment, the eunuch whom the Crown Princess trusted the most came over.The eunuch saluted first, and then said, \" The third imperial concubine, do you recognize Shen Mingyun?\"Luo Shuyu thought for a while, thinking that the person who should come was still here: \"Yes, if he came with my grandmother today, it should be my distant cousin.\"The eunuch said, \"This Shen gongzi had a dispute with the Crown Princess just now. He mentioned you, the Crown Princess let you come and take a look.\"Luo Shuyu held back his smile and pretended to be surprised: \"...how could he have a dispute with the Crown Princess?\"The distinguished guests in the palace thought in their hearts: Today is really a good day to eat melons.After watching Luo Shuyu left the Third Prince's Mansion, Li Mingjin thought that it would be boring to be alone in the mansion, so he dragged his leg that hadn't completely healed to the Punishment Department to find Tang Shilang, forcibly followed him to study, and read the archives over the years.[sh\u00ec l\u00e1ng = ancient official title assistant minister]During lunch, Li Mingjin went to the public dining hall with the officials of the Ministry of Punishment.Tang Shilang sat opposite him and asked, \"Your Highness is still used to the food here.\" I thought I waited for you to throw away the steamed buns and pickles, and don't come back tomorrow to break our hearts.Li Mingjin had never been very picky: \"It's good, the steamed buns are big enough.\"Tang Shilang: \"...\"After the meal, the two walked back, Li Mingjin unconsciously touched the sachet on his waist, \"By the way, Lao Tang, your wife has given you a sachet.\"Tang Shilang touched his beard : \"No.\"Li Mingjin shook the satin sachet on his waist in front of him: \"You don't have it, I have it.\"Tang Shilang: \"...\" You are showing off!The author has something to say:The Third Prince: Wife, you offended me last night.Luo Shuyu: ?The Third Prince: Don't let me tweet there.Luo Shuyu: ...Go awayPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She brought Shen Mingyun, it was imposibble if she didn't even show up. She brought the three of them from the mansion, one who liked to pick things up, one who didn't have enough brains and was sent back to the mansion by Luo Shuyu, there was another who looked quite shrewd on weekdays, but when it came to major events, he couldn't handle it clearly, and he almost made her mad.Mrs. Luo didn't know what she had done, and she was so troubled by these unsatisfactory things in her later years. What's worse, the most promising Luo Shuyu didn't have a heart with her. She regretted it now. Listened to the slut Liu Shi, she broke up with Luo Shuyu.Luo Shuyu went to the side hall to rescue Shen Mingyun?Of course not, he just wanted to see how Shen Mingyun offended the Crown Princess, and how the Crown Princess wanted to punish him.He wasn't surprised at all about Shen Mingyun's physique where accidents would happen wherever he went. How did he escape this time?When he read the books, in this chrysanthemums viewing banquet, Shen Mingyun became the big winner. Everyone knew that he was talented, read a lot of books, and the crown prince still had a good impression of him. At that time, the crown princess who was present, was robbed of the limelight and could only hold back. The anger accumulated, but never dared to attack him, at most stabbed him a few words in the mouth.Shen Mingyun didn't like the privileged characters in the original book by nature, and even more disgusted the crown princess who was a bit domineering. He scolded her several times in his heart. How could it be possible to be a friend with the crown princess.Later, when the crown prince was pulled down, Shen Mingyun sneered at the former crown princess, and the crown princess was so angry that she almost scratched his face, but at that time, the crown prince was no longer a crown prince.Now that the Crown Princess was still dealing with the period of beauty, she was still had a relationship with Shen Mingyun.What made Luo Shuyu felt strange was, why did Shen Mingyun directly have conflict with the Crown Princess this time? There was no such part in the book he read. That day, Shen Mingyun came and went freely, so it was beautiful.Under the leadership of the eunuch, Luo Shuyu and Mrs. Luo came to the side hall.At a glance, he saw Shen Mingyun, a commoner, kneeling on the ground under the pressure of the two maids, his hair was messed up, and the hosta on his head was missing somewhere.The phrase \"a man has gold under his knees\" didn't seem to apply today, and no one helped him.When Shen Mingyun heard someone saluted Luo Shuyu, he immediately turned around and shouted, \"Cousin Shu Yu, help me quickly!\"As soon as he finished speaking, Luo Shuyu wanted to laugh, why did he help Shen Mingyun? What kind of onion was he?Before Luo Shuyu entered the Third Prince's Mansion, he did everything possible to destroy his marriage with Li Mingjin.On the one hand, this person despised imperial power in his heart, and on the other hand, he hoped that he would have the privilege in his hands, or let someone with privilege helped him, how could there be such a good thing.Luo Shuyu didn't look at Shen Mingyun, but bowed to the crown princess first: \"Shu Yu has seen the crown princess.\"Although the crown princess didn't like Luo Shuyu, she still tried to save face: \"The third sister in law doesn't need to bow, sit down and say right away.\"\"Yes.\" Only then Luo Shuyu looked at Shen Mingyun, he put his attitude right, and respected the crown princess, and only now he cared about it, \"What's wrong?\"The maid next to the crown princess said, \"Go back to The third imperial concubine, this person is not right, and when viewing flowers, he folded a ten-zhang curtain, which was the favorite of the crown princess. I don't know why is it! He said that you are his cousin , so the Crown Princess invited you to come and take a look.\"[ten-zhang curtain = variety of chrysantheum]The Crown Princess, Yan Wandie nodded : \"That's right.\"No matter what, Shen Mingyun knew that he couldn't be saved. He was dressed in a very demonic (seductive) manner today, dressed in green, looked a little pitiful when he looked at Luo Shuyu. If the crown prince was here, he may still be soft-hearted, but the people present were the princess and women, and it was difficult for anyone to like this appearance.Before Luo Shuyu could speak, Mrs. Luo saluted the Crown Princess first. She had her own orders, and the Crown Princess didn't embarrass her, so she gave her a seat directly.Mrs. Luo actually didn't dare to sit, but she still sat down because of her age: \"It's the minister's wife who doesn't have the ability to teach her son, and asked the crown princess to punish him.\"\"Mrs. Luo doesn't have to do this.\" Yan Wandie didn't expect the old lady would come over, she actually just wanted to take advantage of Shen Mingyun's arrogance and Luo Shuyu's strength. At the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet that day, among the three princes and concubines, he was the only one who was praised by the father emperor and she couldn't beat him, she felt really uncomfortable.She finally got a chance today, she wanted to make things difficult, and she wanted to stand up against Luo Shuyu with her majesty as a crown princess.Who would have thought that Mrs. Luo ran out to beg for mercy, and now she had to give face to this old fellow. After all, she was the official lady of Shangshufu.The Crown Princess looked at Luo Shuyu and Mrs. Luo: \"The ten-zhang curtain was indeed searched for by someone from this palace for a long time, and now it has been broken, and this palace is very sad. Isn't it ?\"[\u5bab g\u014dng = palace; royal members called themself when they speak, except the emperor uses zhen]Luo Shuyu could understand the thoughts of the Crown Princess, Shen Mingyun should be doomed today, and it was impossible not to punish him.Punishment was good, he wouldn't lose the slightest, but would be happier.The old lady Luo really had no idea at the moment. She looked at Luo Shuyu and hoped that he would come up with an idea. She usually spoke domineringly\u00a0 in the house, but outside she couldn't even get angry. If it was another aristocratic family lady, the crown princess reckoned, opened one eye and closing one eye, after all, the Luo family didn't have the family heritage of an aristocratic family that could affect the whole body.Luo Shuyu knew that it would be impossible to justify without mentioning the punishment at this time. It was Shen Mingyun's fault, not the Crown Princess.\"The Crown Princess, since Shen Mingyun broke the rules, I need to give you an explanation.\" He turned his head and asked Shen Mingyun, \"Cousin, did you break the flowers?\"Shen Mingyun was still kneeling on the ground, and the system suggested: Endure for a moment, calmly take a step back and open the sky.He just wanted to pick that flower back and put it in a book to air-dry it as a collection. Who knew that he would be seen when hi picked it, and it was the owner of the courtyard. If he wanted to blame someone, he could only blame himself for his bad luck \"Yes, I broke it\",\u00a0 as a man he dared to act.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What do you think?, next time he won't make a mistake again.\"Yan Wandie originally wanted to say that he would be punished for three days, but Luo Shuyu didn't expect that it would take half a month when he opened his mouth, wondering if this person had compromised with herself: \"Yes, I will send people to stare at him for half a month, not a day less.\"Luo Shuyu said to Shen Mingyun: \"The crown princess is kind, you will reflect on the chrysanthemums garden for half a month.\"Shen Mingyun: \"... Yes, thank the crown princess, thank the third imperial concubine.\" you were fucking kind, he said to the system in his mind, \"System, it's too fucking too much!\"The system: \"No way, who asked you to pick the flowers. If you are caught, you will also be fined if you change to modern times.\"Of course, Shen Mingyun didn't know what kind of hell he would meet in the next two weeks. Luo Shuyu had already figured it out how to get people to take care of this \"fake cousin\".He originally wanted the crown princess to reward Shen Mingyun with a few hits, and his ass would bloom, but when he thought of being hated by him for a slap in his previous life, Luo Shuyu could only change to a roundabout way that couldn't arouse his fighting spirit. He was punished, and what's the matter with him, The Crown Princess? He was called by Shen Mingyun on his own initiative, and he (LSY) even \"saved\" him.Now, Shen Mingyun not only failed to complete the task of \"be a good friend with the Crown Princess\", but was punished by the Crown Princess instead. With the Crown Princess as a comparison, Luo Shuyu became the righteous faction.Naturally, it was impossible for Shen Mingyun to continue attending the banquet. The Crown Princess asked someone to arrange a room for him. He would start working from tomorrow and let him go today.The chrysanthemum banquet continued as usual.After Luo Shuyu and Mrs. Luo left, the Crown Princess played with the bracelet in her hand and said to the old maid next to her, \"How can Luo Shuyu compromise so quickly? He doesn't want to be my enemy, or he is too cowardly.\"The old maid: \"In my opinion, this third prince and his imperial concubine want to rest and calm down. I heard that Luofu paid no attention to him as a son in law, and he has no brotherly affection for that Shen Mingyun. He is naturally willing to listen to the crown princess.\"The crown princess : \"That's right. In the future, this world will belong to the crown prince, and he will live according to our consideration.\"The old maid: \"It's the crown princess who is lucky.\"The crown princess smiled arrogantly, and then brought everyone to the banquet.Without Shen Mingyun shined brightly at the banquet, Luo Shuyu was quite comfortable at this chrysanthemum banquet.The Crown Princess' gaze also turned to the unmarried women. It was impossible for Luo Fu's side. After all, Luo Shuyu was the third imperial concubine, it was even more impossible for the Crown Princess to choose someone from Luofu.After the banquet, everyone who was supposed to leave left. The Crown Princess also gave everyone some snacks made of chrysanthemums to take back to have a taste. Luo Shuyu also brought some chrysanthemum cakes, thinking about giving Li Mingjin a taste, he thought it was delicious.On the way back, Luo Shuyu was in a very good mood. He couldn't deal with Shen Mingyun right away, but at least he could disgust him.Less than a quarter of an hour after they set off, the carriage stopped, and Luo Shuyu sent Qingwang to ask the guard who was driving.Qingwang poked his head and went out: \"Why did you stop? What's...\" the matter.Then Qingwang got out of the car under Luo Shuyu's puzzled gaze, someone pulled the carriage curtain, it was the hand belonging to a man, and then a familiar handsome face appeared in front of him.Luo Shuyu exclaimed: \"His Royal Highness, why are you here?\"Li Mingjin, who propped himself on the carriage with both hands, said, \"It's fine anyway, so I'm here.\"Luo Shuyu was speechless, he really didn't think about it. When he went out, Li Mingjin would come to pick him up in person. Saying that he was not moved would be a lie. He felt more and more that he would treat him well in the future.He was a fool, really stupid.After Li Mingjin sat down, he asked him, \"Did the banquet go well today?\"Luo Shuyu told him that Shen Mingyun was punished by the Crown Princess for damaging the precious chrysanthemum.\"There is such a thing, and he deserves it. \"\"Yes, a three-year-old boy knows that you can't move the flowers at the banquet even if you move the grass on the ground.\"People in Daxia were very fond of flowers. Luo Renshou even had a garden himself, Luo Shuyu also liked it, otherwise Luo Shuyu wouldn't met Liu Yong who cheated in the garden last time.With Li Mingjin around, Luo Shuyu wasn't at all worried about the fact that it was too late. Instead, he saw the rare red glow reflected in the sky.It was as red as fire, just like their happy day.Luo Shuyu was lying on the edge of the window and looked out. After the red sky became dark, he took the initiative to lean on Li Mingjin and called softly, \"Your Highness.\"The beauty took the initiative to embrace, and Li Mingjin wasn't Liu Xiahui : \"Huh?\"[Lui Xiahui was a man of eminent virtue, and is said on one occasion to have a lady in this lap without the slightest imputation on his moral character]Luo Shuyu wrapped his hands around his neck and took the initiative to kiss his lips.Li Mingjin: \"...\"My wife was too proactive, he couldn't resist!The kiss still had to be kissed back.The next day.Yesterday, the Crown Princess's banquet was a relatively big battle, and all the gers and the daughters who came back from the Crown Prince's Courtyard saw it.The third prince picked up the third imperial concubine when he went out from the banquet in less than half a quarter of an hour!The newlywed wasn't like what the outside world said. The third prince was cold-blooded and ruthless towards the new imperial concubine. The feeling was really unusual, very loving.Those who waited to see the joke were afraid to be disappointed .For a time, Luo Shuyu's unknown husband-control technique spread in the capital, and the third prince had fallen for his ecstasy.Luo Shuyu got up a little late because he was a little tired from riding the carriage yesterday.The people around him already went out in the morning.It was usually time to come back at this hour, but Luo Shuyu didn't see Li Mingjin until noon. Last night he didn't tell him where he would go today, and didn't leave a word or a sentence before going out.In his last life, he didn't even know Li Mingjin's whereabouts for a month, and he didn't care too much, but now, he was used to see each other every day, knowing where the other party was at all times, but suddenly he disappeared and he became worried.When you came back, you must talk to\u00a0 \u00a0him well, and let him leave a note anyway.And where is Li Mingjin at this time?After the early morning court, Li Mingjin rode to the camp in the effective area.In the suburban camp, there was a doctor who was especially good at treating bruises and sprains. He heard that this doctor could restore his swollen leg became normal in one day.At this time, it was the young general Lin Haiming who just came back from the battlefield not long ago.Many people didn't know that he and Li Mingjin met each other in the early years, and they had many private contacts, and they were considered good friends.Lin Haiming saw Li Mingjin as if he had seen a ghost: \"Third prince, what are you doing in the military camp?\"Li Mingjin pointed to his leg, which was still wrapped in cloth: \"Find the doctor in your army to treat my leg.\"Lin Haiming With a constipated look on his face: \"...You came all the way here to make fun of me?\"Li Mingjin said impatiently, \"Take me to see him quickly, I'm in a hurry!\"He couldn't wait for a moment.The author Has something to say:The Third Prince: Hurry, hurry, hurry!Luo Shuyu: \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Whether they knew him or not, they would send it. The number of invitations received in half a year in the last life was not as many as those in the past few days.It could be seen that there was no \"conflict\" with the crown princess at the chrysanthemum banquet that day, and in the end they were at peace with each other. Everyone saw the ability of the third imperial concubine. When they returned, even the third prince came to pick him up in person.Following the crown prince's chrysanthemum banquet, many chrysanthemum banquets organized by this lady and that lady appeared. Not only him, but even Li Mingjin received a lot of invitations from this marquis and that marquis, but no one expected Li Mingjin attended, only invited him by the way, with all the courtesy.Luo Shuyu looked at the stack of invitations on the table. He didn't want to go to any of them. Now he was more concerned about Shen Mingyun's work in the other courtyard.Not to mention, different situations happened every day.Although Shen Mingyun was a member of Luo Shangshu's residence, he offended the Crown Princess, and Luo Renshou wanted to protect him. After he learned that Shen Mingyun also pulled the banner of the third prince, he almost sprayed the tea out of his mouth. After thinking about it again and again, Luo Renshou directly gave up the idea of protecting Shen Mingyun. Anyway, he made a mistake first. It wouldn't be a problem to plant flowers in another yard for a few days.How could Shen Mingyun have no problem?Luo Shuyu deliberately asked people to bribe the person who supervised\u00a0 Shen Mingyun, and didn't let him idle for a moment. When the time came, he asked him to fetch water and fertilize.Shen Mingyun liked to sleep until late, so he was called to wake up on time every morning;Shen Mingyun usually liked to eat big fish and meat, so he made people gave him pickled vegetables and steamed buns every day, and he would never starve to death;Shen Mingyun was accustomed to talk to the system in his mind, so when the supervisor saw him in a daze, he went over to remind him to continue working.When he read the book, Shen Mingyun mentioned that the fertilizers used in his era were clean, but their current era was different. They used human or animal feces. Luo Shuyu sent someone every day to let him fetch manure and water.Did Shen Mingyun want to do it ? Of course there were other ways to fix him if he didn't want.The old maid who supervised him wouldn't beat him or scold him, but would only take out a list to record the tasks he had to complete every day.Who made him cheap and did the stupid thing of picking flowers, who wouldn't punish him?The people present that day were all wives of famous families. As long as anyone had the heart to inquire, they would know that Shen Mingyun was punished by the crown princess, whether it was light or serious, although Shen Mingyun was not very famous in the capital, but he opened some shops, there were still many young women and gers who visit the two rouge shops, and most of them knew him. As soon as he had an accident, a lot of rumors came out.Luo Shuyu had only one sentence to comment on this: Feng Shui takes turns.As long as Shen Mingyun's life was not good, he would be happy.However, Shen Mingyun was the protagonist of the book after all, even if he was in trouble, he soon got a turnaround.Seven days later, the person who supervised him came back and reported to Luo Shuyu that Shen Mingyun was taken away by the fourth prince.Luo Shuyu was a little surprised. The other courtyard belonged to the crown prince. How did the fourth prince run in and take people away?\"Tell me how he was brought out?\" Luo Shuyu deeply felt that Shen Mingyun's life was pretty good. It took only seven days for this job, and it was estimated that his skin wasn't even tanned.It was Anjiu who came back. Since Luo Shuyu entered the Third Prince's Mansion, he and Anshi had been given the important task of following Shen Mingyun. Today, it was his turn to come back and report about Shen Mingyun's situation.It turned out that after the crown princess held the chrysanthemum banquet, the crown prince held another one, and it was yesterday.The prince invited some scholars, and most of them had a lot of research on chrysanthemums on weekdays.Shen Mingyun was watering and pruning the chrysanthemums with the gardener at the time. The crown prince was chatting with some scholars about the flowering period of chrysanthemums.As soon as the poem was finished, a famous person looked at the pots of the precious black and purple chrysanthemums.It was also a coincidence that the person who the famous person pointed at was Shen Mingyun.Although Shen Mingyun looked down at the ancients, but after being tortured for six days, he knew that people had to bow their heads under the eaves. He seized the opportunity and directly used the system to report the origin of the precious chrysanthemums and the details that others didn't know. The system helped him to win the prize in one fell swoop, the eyes of everyone present.Not only this pot, but Shen Mingyun also told them the details of the chrysanthemum he saw one by one.Everyone saw that he was right about chrysanthemum. These guests looked at Shen Mingyun differently. Even the crown prince was amazed by Shen Mingyun. If it wasn't for Shen Mingyun's face at that time, his face was still stained with mud and he was wearing a bloated sackcloth. It was estimated that the crown prince would immediately accept him as a concubine.In this way, Shen Mingyun showed his face in front of the crown prince.Luo Shuyu asked Anjiu: \"But what does this have to do with the fourth prince? Didn't the crown prince find out that he was different at first?\"Anjiu said that he (the fourth prince) was here by coincidence. When he went to the other courtyard, he recognized Shen Mingyun, and the crown prince who was in a very good mood. After the fourth prince suggested that he knew Shen Mingyun and said there might be some misunderstanding, the crown prince agreed to the fourth prince to take Shen Mingyun away.Because the crown prince thought it was the crown princess' actions this time. After all, he was the one who shared the bed with the crown princess, and he believed that he understood her temperament.Just like that, the crown prince let Shen Mingyun go without a word.After that, when the fourth prince left, he sent Shen Mingyun back to Luofu.Luo Shuyu was not surprised after hearing this. Shen Mingyun and the fourth prince were the protagonists in the book, and it was reasonable for them to meet under special circumstances.He didn't feel sorry anymore, at least for the past few days, listening to how Shen Mingyun accepted the baptisms of the old maid was also a good meal every day, and it was also necessary for Shen Mingyun to understand the rules of these ancients.Although Luo Shuyu didn't know that Shen Mingyun went to the Crown Princess to enjoy the chrysanthemum banquet with a mission, it was obvious that his mission this time was \"failure\". Shen Mingyun was tortured for a few days, which could be described as frustration.Shen Mingyun thought that it was no big deal if he didn't have the Crown Princess's trust. He had a system that others didn't have, which was the source of his sense of superiority.Recently, his mission wasn't going well, and he was punished when he attended a banquet. Shen Mingyun secretly hated the Crown Princess.In this regard, Luo Shuyu was happy to see it succeed.However, there was one thing that made Luo Shuyu a little worried, the fourth prince and Shen Mingyun were still getting closer and closer.How could he make their relationship less intimate?Shen Mingyun had a system, and he could use it to save himself from danger. In this regard, Luo Shuyu had nothing to do.In the last life, the relationship between the fourth prince and Shen Mingyun developed naturally. The two of them had experienced many things before they got married, and their relationship could be said to be very strong.In modern times, Shen Mingyun was considered to have read countless men. In their era, he also had contact with several other so-called bigwigs. After many considerations, he chose the most powerful fourth prince in the entire Daxia.Luo Shuyu wasn't sure whether he could stop Shen Mingyun from seeing those so-called bigwigs, which was something he couldn't predict.It's hard to predict what would happen if he couldn't control it, and to prevent this road from going nowhere, then he could change his strategy against Shen Mingyun according to the current situation.If Shen Mingyun would still become the fourth prince concubine, then, if he helped Shen Mingyun changed some order before he became the fourth prince's concubine, saved him and the fourth prince from the process of \"letting the flow\" to know each other and love each other, let him did it in advance. Would it be different if he became a husband and wife with the fourth prince, and then let him meet other \"Bigwigs\"?The more Luo Shuyu thought about it, the more he felt that his new plan was very attractive, but it was a bit difficult to implement.The first thing to do was to let the fourth prince marry Shen Mingyun.Imperial concubine was a bit difficult, what if it was a concubine?Also, who should arrange it?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He seemed to be light-hearted, but in fact he had more twists and turns in his stomach than anyone else. He was extremely vigilant and didn't trust others.Sending him and Shen Mingyun into a pile, if the process was unnatural, he would definitely become suspicious, and it may be possible to give up Shen Mingyun directly.Still difficult.As soon as Li Mingjin went out of the room, he looked at Luo Shuyu who was sitting near the window, staring at the potted orchid and sighing.He stepped forward and covered Luo Shuyu's eyes: \"Guess who I am?\"\"No.\" Luo Shuyu took off his hand, laughed at him, and looked up at Li Mingjin: \"You're back.\"The autumn wind was strong, With the window still open, Li Mingjin pulled him back to the couch: \"Well, what are you sighing for?\"\"It's just that there is something I can't figure out.\" Luo Shuyu was now in front of Li Mingjin, and he would tell him everything he could say.Li Mingjin asked him, \"What's the matter?\"At this moment, Grandma Feng knocked on the door, came in and asked if they needed dinner.Luo Shuyu said, \"Okay, let's eat first. His Highness has been busy all day, so he must be hungry.\"\"I'm not very hungry.\" Only he knew what Li Mingjin was busy with, and he felt a little guilty.Luo Shuyu was not easy to talk to Li Mingjin about the matter of plotting against the fourth prince and Shen Mingyun. If he did, he didn't know how Li Mingjin would see him, would he think that he was a person with deep scheming, and suddenly plotted against a prince who was not outstanding. What happened next? He couldn't explain it, and it wasn't like he could use the \"experts outside\" as a shield.After dinner, Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu casually strolled around the mansion to digest food. Afterwards, Li Mingjin actually fell asleep properly, which made Luo Shuyu felt a little uncomfortable.Luo Shuyu slept well, and woke up the next day as usual.After he finished his breakfast, Qingwang chose a new set of autumn clothes for him, and added a cloak.Luo Shuyu was puzzled for a while: \"What is this for?\"Qingwang: \"Gongzi, this is what Your Highness means.\"Luo Shuyu fastened his cloak: \"Is this going to go out?\" By the way, the cloak is lighter.Qingwang smiled: \"His Royal Highness is already waiting for you at the door.\"It seemed that Li Mingjin really wanted to take him out, but it was a mystery why he didn't say it last night.Luo Shuyu was a little puzzled, but he still followed Li Mingjin's wishes and went to see what he wanted to do.When he walked to the gate, he saw Li Mingjin, who was quite different today. He was standing beside a black horse in a strong suit. The horse was impatiently swinging its big tail, trying to put its head on Li Mingjin, but was pushed away by him. A saddle was attached to the back.Its name was Chaifeng (chasing the wind).Luo Shuyu remembered that there was a follow-up about the horse, it was written in the book.After they were imprisoned, it was brought into the mansion by the fourth prince. Once Shen Mingyun wanted to learn to ride a horse, he saw Chaifeng at a glance.The servant who kept the horse advised Shen Mingyun not to choose it, but he didn't listen to anyone's advice at all. He insisted on getting on the horse's back to learn how to tame the horse himself, but Chaifeng already had an owner and his own temperament, it only recognized Li Mingjin. Shen Mingyun, as soon as he climbed onto its back, he was knocked down and directly injured his leg.After the fourth prince found out, he directly sent someone to kill it. This was the final outcome of Chaifeng.Seeing Chaifeng again, Luo Shuyu felt quite emotional in his heart, and it was still alive.\"Your Highness, where are we going?\"Li Mingjin stretched out his hand to lead him: \"Come here, get on the horse first, and you will know where we are going later.\"Luo Shuyu knew Chaifeng's temper: \"Chaifeng won't let me sit, Why don't I change another one.\"Li Mingjin said, \"Don't be afraid, it doesn't dare not to let you sit when I'm here.\"Luo Shuyu tried to pat Chaifeng's back lightly: \"That's fine.\" There was no resistance, it seemed because there was a master, a bit coward?After getting on the horse, Luo Shuyu noticed that today's Li Mingjin was very unusual. He grabbed the reins and said, \"Your Highness, when your feet heal?\"He saw him limping last night, pretending?Li Mingjin got on the horse, sat behind Luo Shuyu, hugged his slender waist tightly, and said vaguely, \"Well, it's just these two days.\"\"You have something to hide from me.\" Luo Shuyu looked at him sideways, and was accidentally stolen by Li Mingjin. After taking a fragrant breath, he kissed his earlobe, \"...Your Highness, this is outside!\"\"Oh, let's go.\" Li Mingjin pretended not to hear, took out a veil from his arms and handed it to Luo Shuyu, \"Put it on first, it's windy. \"Luo Shuyu: \"...\" Are you sure it's just because of the wind?The rein in Luo Shuyu's hand was also taken by Li Mingjin, and he leaned on his arms and wore a veil. Li Mingjin was extremely satisfied, so that others wouldn't see his wife's face.Set off.They were in the front, followed by eight guards and Qingwang.Early in the morning, the third prince took a beautiful ger with his horse and rode out of the city.A lot of people saw it. In a short time,the news spread in the whole capital. The third prince and the third imperial concubine who only married for less than a month, rode the horse out of the city. It really was the third prince, it was too shameless!The storyteller in the teahouse had a new story to make up today.At this time, after rode the horse for nearly half an hour, Luo Shuyu saw the Maple Leaf Forest that Li Mingjin had mentioned before!Looking into the past, it seemed like a fire covered the entire mountain.Li Mingjin took the horse and asked Luo Shuyu: \"Does it look good?\"Luo Shuyu nodded, he remembered a poem in the book describing Fenglin, \"Parking and sitting in love with Fenglin late, maple leaves are red in February.\"He took a deep breath. The air in the mountains, it turned out that Li Mingjin would do what he said, and really took him to see the maple leaves.Li Mingjin winked at him, pointed to his cheek, and leaned forward: \"this is what you want, and now...\"Luo Shuyu pinched his face lightly, and laughed: \"No.\"Li Mingjin was not annoyed either, squeezed his hand, bit it lightly on the back of his hand, and said his plan: \"Today we will go up the mountain for the hot spring, and tomorrow we will go down.\"Luo Shuyu lived two lifetimes and didn't know that there was still a hot spring here. Li Mingjin: \"Well, I asked someone to order it before, but I just never remembered it. The last time we talked about Fuxinyuan, I thought of the hot spring above. This season is just right.\"In less than a quarter of an hour, they came to the villa on the mountainside. In fact, the mountain was not high, and it was not difficult to climb up.The scenery of the villa was not as beautiful as the Third Prince's Mansion, but it also had the characteristics of the mountains. The maple leaf forest was really beautiful. Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin went for a circle in the nearby woods, and even picked up a few leaves and sandwiched them in the middle of the book.When they came back, they had lunch. It was all mountain preys from the hunters in the mountains. It was delicious. Luo Shuyu was in a good mood, and he almost ate too much.In the afternoon, when the wind was not strong and the sun was just right, Li Mingjin asked Luo Shuyu to take a bath together.The two were changing their clothes indoors and were about to go in for a bath.Luo Shuyu hung up Li Mingjin's clothes, but who knew that he pressed the hard object under the clothes, slightly moved the clothes, and found that there were several small porcelain vases underneath.Luo Shuyu's hand on the clothes trembled slightly, and his face was slightly hot: \"...\"It turned out that this was the purpose of bringing him to Maple Leaf Forest.The author has something to say:The Third Prince: Wife, do you like it? It will definitely be unforgettable!Luo Shuyu:\u00a0 \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was needed for the first time for the ger's body.Luo Shuyu quietly put it in Li Mingjin's clothes back in place, pretending not to see anything.Of course he knew that this day would come sooner or later. When he was lying in bed recently, he could also feel that Li Mingjin's eyes were getting more and more wrong. Even the two of them were usually glued together tightly, as if he could be dismantled and swallowed at any time.Luo Shuyu didn't have much experience in doing this with him in his previous life, but it was unlikely that he would refuse.\"It's done, let's go over there.\" Li Mingjin had already walked out from behind the screen next to him. He was trying hard to suppress the eagerness in his mind just now. His mind was full of those thoughts, trying his best to make himself looked less anxious.\"Yeah.\" It wasn't the first time that Luo Shuyu saw Li Mingjin wearing trousers only in recent days. Now that he saw his sturdy upper body, and a man who was bigger than the ger, he seemed to hear his own heartbeat. Seeing those small porcelain bottles, he didn't have such a big reaction.Luo Shuyu was also wearing obscene clothes and trousers, but he was also covered with a coat to avoid catching a cold.The two opened the door next to them, and inside was a room where the hot spring water was bubbling.When Luo Shuyu tested the water temperature with his toe, Li Mingjin had already changed out of his clogs and dived into the water with a clatter.Li Mingjin splashed the water, and he wiped his face with his hands. The water drops fell from his firm chest. He sat at the bottom of the pool and reached out to Luo Shuyu: \"Yu'er, come here.\"Luo Shuyu who was standing on the edge of the pool was a little hesitant, but after thinking about it, he took off the coat that was draped over his shoulders.His posture in the water was relatively gentle, and he could also feel Li Mingjin's fiery eyes sweeping over him.The temperature of the water was just right, and with the desire in Li Mingjin's eyes, Luo Shuyu resolutely sat across from him and didn't sit with him.Li Mingjin called him again in a deep voice: \"Yu'er, come here.\"Luo Shuyu put his back against the edge of the pool and shook his head with a smile, not wanting him to succeed.But Li Mingjin had prepared for many days. The moment Luo Shuyu's coat fell to reveal his fair shoulders, he couldn't hold it anymore, and now there was only a trace of reason left. Just me, he came to the mountain, the same thing.Luo Shuyu splashed the water on his chest: \"Li Mingjin, promise me, take a good soak in the hot spring.\"At this time, Li Mingjin wouldn't listen to him, grabbed his wrist, put his big hand on his waist, and gently tapped it. The next moment, Luo Shuyu's whole person was held in his arms and forced to sit in his lap.Li Mingjin said solemnly: \"Yu'er, I don't want to soak in the hot spring, and I don't want to be Liu Xiahui.\"Luo Shuyu took a deep breath, gathered up his courage, turned around, and put his hands on Li Mingjin's shoulders, he asked Li Mingjin in a low voice: \"If you don't want to soak in the hot spring, what do you want to do?\"Li Mingjin's eyes brightened: \"Complete our unfinished bridal chamber.\"Luo Shuyu looked directly at Li Mingjin, felt a foreign object, and moved back: \"Here?\"Li Mingjin stood up from the water holding him in his arms: \"There is nothing better than this.\"Luo Shuyu hurriedly hugged his neck and exclaimed: \"Li Mingjin! \"Li Mingjin reassured him: \"Don't be afraid, it's said that the first time for ger is not very painful, I will pay attention. \"Luo Shuyu didn't know whether it was the steam or because of Li Mingjin's words, his face was so hot that he buried his face on Li Mingjin's neck. When he was put down, he found that there was a piece of cushion bed on the edge of the pool.You are so prepared.The next moment, he had no intention of thinking about anything else, Li Mingjin had lightly bit his lips, and the two were involved in a belated affair....This afternoon, Luo Shuyu shouted until hoarsely, Li Mingjin let go of him.Li Mingjin, who experienced the happiness of the bridal chamber for the first time, was full of contentment. He hugged Luo Shuyu into the pool for a symbolic soak in the hot spring for a while, then gave the two of them a simple bath and went back to the room.Luo Shuyu lay on the bed and fell asleep while thinking: If a man takes you to the hot spring, don't believe it, he just wants to have a bridal chamber with you.Li Mingjin hugged Luo Shuyu to sleep, thinking that the small porcelain bottles he prepared seemed to be useless, and the book didn't seem to be very credible.When Luo Shuyu woke up after being tossed for an afternoon, the sky was already dark, and there was only a burning candle in the room.Li Mingjin leaned on the bedside to read a miscellaneous book, he felt Luo Shuyu moving, so he put the book down: \"Awake?\"Luo Shuyu sat up with the strength of Li Mingjin's hands, stretched, and wondered if it was because of the intimate affair between the two of them. After they were all done, Luo Shuyu and him got closer again, and he wasn't too shy.There was a bit of coquettishness in his sleepy voice: \"I'm hungry.\"Li Mingjin pressed his waist: \"Okay, let's have dinner.\"Luo Shuyu leaned on him and asked him to press it well : \"What time is it now?\"Li Mingjin said, \"It's almost time for dinner.\"Luo Shuyu raised his eyes and felt that Li Mingjin's line of sight was in the wrong direction. He looked down and found that his underwear was open, the scenery inside was unobstructed, and there were red marks on his chest that he sucked out in the afternoon.He was busy tying up his underwear, Li Mingjin took one step ahead of him, Luo Shuyu, who just sat up, was pushed down on the bed again, and Li Mingjin lowered his head again.Luo Shuyu pushed his head away with his palm: \"Li Mingjin, I'm really hungry.\"Li Mingjin raised his head, with a blurry look in his eyes: \"I'm hungry too.\"Luo Shuyu pushed him away, turned over and sat up, fiercely said: \" Sit down for me, don't move.\"Li Mingjin had to lie on the bed, with a bit of grievance in his voice: \"You murdered me, and you turned your face after the bridal chamber and didn't recognize anyone.\"Luo Shuyu grabbed the clothes next to him and put them on one by one , the corners of his mouth raised, amused by him.Li Mingjin, who was lying on his stomach, looked sideways at him.Luo Shuyu felt hot all over when he saw him: \"That's enough, get up and eat quickly.\"Li Mingjin got up after a while, and was pulled out of the bedroom by Luo Shuyu to eat in the main hall.Luo Shuyu, who had just experienced the first time in the afternoon, since he was still young and didn't feel much discomfort.Li Mingjin deliberately asked people to make dinner lighter. Of course, he also asked people to prepare meat.After being married to Luo Shuyu for many days, Li Mingjin never concealed his love for meat from Luo Shuyu.Halfway through the meal, Li Mingjin had a vegetable in his bowl, and Luo Shuyu looked at him with a smile: \"Your Highness, don't eat meat only.\"Luo Shuyu knew that Li Mingjin loved meat, and Luo Shuyu knew that he didn't like vegetables.Thinking of the satisfaction this afternoon, Li Mingjin took Luo Shuyu's vegetables as meat dishes, and didn't find it tasteless at all.After the two had dinner, they asked the guard to move two chairs and sit in the courtyard to chat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Luo Shuyu was quite comfortable in Li Mingjin's oversized coat.The melons and fruits on the stone table were all picked by the servants here. Luo Shuyu broke the orange and handed half of it to Li Mingjin.The two chatted while eating fruit.Luo Shuyu: \"Tomorrow, let's bring some oranges back and let someone send them to the palace for the mother concubine?\"Li Mingjin: \"Well, okay.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Should we go back early tomorrow?\"Li Mingjin: \" No, If you want to stay for two more days, it will be enough.\"Luo Shuyu: \"You are not going to the court?\"Li Mingjin: \"It doesn't matter, father won't say anything.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Others must be envious.\"Li Mingjin: \"They prefer me to be like this.\" He didn't want to hide it from Luo Shuyu, swallowed the sweet orange, and asked Luo Shuyu tentatively, \"Yu'er, do you want me to be like this all the time?\"Luo Shuyu stopped peeling the orange and asked him, \"Does your Highness like this?\"He naturally didn't want it. If it continued like this, he was afraid that the two of them would end up like their previous lives.He hadn't found the right way to talk to Li Mingjin about the future. He was afraid that talking about it would make Li Mingjin felt he was too anxious, and he was afraid that he would doubt it. Now Li Mingjin took the initiative to mention it, and he had nothing to worry about.Li Mingjin looked up at the starry sky: \"I don't know.\"Luo Shuyu put down the oranges and squatted in front of him. Li Mingjin was stunned for a moment, hurriedly pulled him up, and let him sat down in his arms, \"How tired you are from squatting.\"Luo Shuyu felt warm, he held his face, kissed his warm lips: \"His Royal Highness, no matter what you decide, I will support you, it's me, not Luofu, not any party, I have no rare treasures, and no gold and silver, but I hope the things in my head can help you, if you need it.\"Li Mingjin thought that the things in his head meant wisdom and ingenuity, put his arms around his waist and kissed him back: \"Yu'er, thank you. The mother concubine is not very close to me, and I don't know how to talk to people close to me. Now, the only person who is the closest to me is you.\"Luo Shuyu leaned on him and said sincerely : \"In this world, the one who is the closest to me and the one who I can trust is only you.\"Li Mingjin: \"Okay, I believe in you.\"Luo Shuyu knew that the word \"trust\" was not so easy to say, Li Mingjin in his last life, he had never said a word of \"trust\" to him.The breaths of the two were intertwined, and Li Mingjin picked up Luo Shuyu and went back to the bedroom directly. A new round of bridal chamber was opened again, it was from day to night, and this day belonged to the two of them.Naturally, it was also tiring.When he woke up, the sky was already bright, and yesterday's scenes flashed in his mind.Luo Shuyu touched his belly, they were still young and energetic, and they didn't need to do anything.Hope his baby would come back later, and came back to father and daddy when their life was more stable.Li Mingjin got up earlier than Luo Shuyu.When Qingwang finished serving Luo Shuyu, he had already packed up the fruit to take away.The two went straight down the mountain after breakfast.Before leaving, Li Mingjin also ordered people to bake a few more pancakes and let the guards pack them up and sent them to the palace.Luo Shuyu: \"Mother concubine still likes pancakes?\"Li Mingjin: \"Well, although she is not with me, but I know she misses her hometown. I heard her mention pancakes. If she likes pancakes, she will eat them naturally\"Luo Shuyu: \"Mother concubine is not easy.\" He guessed that it was probably because of her sensitive identity that she\u00a0 alienated from Li Mingjin and so her children could grow up smoothly.Li Mingjin: \"Probably.\"In fact, Luo Shuyu felt that the relationship between Concubine Mei and Li Mingjin was not bad.On the return journey, because of overwork last night, Li Mingjin specially accompanied Luo Shuyu in the carriage, fearing that he was too tired to fall asleep yesterday and would catch a cold easily.When approaching the city gate, Luo Shuyu looked out the window and saw an unexpected face.He tugged at Li Mingjin's sleeve: \"His Royal Highness, do you think that is the fourth prince?\"Li Mingjin opened the curtain a bit, narrowed his eyes and said, \"It's him, and the person beside him seems a little familiar.\"\"Who?\" This time, it made Luo Shuyu's to probe again, and took a closer look, \"Shen Mingyun?\"He also thought about how to let Li Mingjin knew that the fourth prince was different to Shen Mingyun, and fell in love with him at first sight. Well, it took no effort to get it.Li Mingjin also wondered, he knew that Li Mingchun admired Shen Mingyun: \"Why did the fourth brother get out of a carriage with the unmarried ger before dawn?\"Luo Shuyu pretended to be angry: \"No, I want to go down and have a look, this is not ruining our reputation?\"Li Mingjin also felt right, the reputation of his wife shouldn't be ruined regardless of other people's reputation.They let the carriage come to the carriage of the fourth prince. Li Mingjin got off the carriage first, touched the whip on his waist, and stared gloomily at the fourth prince.His language was concise, right to the key point: \"Fourth brother, explain.\"How could the fourth prince knew that he would see his third brother as soon as he turned around, and was startled by Li Mingjin, and then saw Luo Shuyu poked out of the carriage, and now he couldn't justify it even more even if he opened his mouth.However, Shen Mingyun didn't have the restraint of \"ger\" and the concept of \"man\" and \"ger\", and looked straight at Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu curiously.He didn't react for a while, how could the third prince, who always had a sullen face, appeared here.From the rut marks of the carriage, it was obvious that they had just returned from outside the city.Luo Shuyu got out of the carriage, Li Mingjin held his waist and let him dismount easily, Luo Shuyu pointed at Shen Mingyun, who was sitting on the edge of the carriage, pretending to be annoyed: \"Shen Mingyun, as a gongzi of Luofu. For the sake of other younger brothers and sisters who haven't left the burdoir, what kind of formality is it to stay with a man all night! Are you asking the younger brothers and sisters in the house to die?\"Shen Mingyun didn't say anything to answer Luo Shuyu's question, but said, \"The fourth prince and I have nothing, don't get me wrong, we just watched the stars and the moon outside last night. If you don't believe me, ask him.\"It was hard to argue: \"Third sister-in-law, we are really not what you think.\"Luo Shuyu especially wanted to laugh out loud. He was picked up by the fourth prince from the Prince's Courtyard, and now he said he only watched the stars and the moon. Something unspeakable didn't happen?In the book, the fourth prince and Shen Mingyun often went out in the middle of the night, and no one knew about them. Over time, they became bold and used to meet at night, which was very exciting and very wild before marriage.Come to think of it, they probably never thought that they would be caught one day.Luo Shuyu looked at the fourth prince angrily: \"The fourth prince, my cousin is stupid and ignorant, but you have read the sage books for so many years, how can you do such a thing, if it's seen by some talkative person today, I'm afraid my cousin can't get married in this life. If he is in the countryside, he is going to be immersed in a pig cage! Are you killing us from Luofu at the gate of the Fourth Prince?\"Daxia didn't prohibit unmarried men went out with the ger and the woman, went out for shopping together on festivals, but you never said that they were allowed to go out on a date in the middle of the night, and they wouldn't go home at night!Luo Shuyu put down a big hat, and the fourth prince looked a little flustered: \"I...\" He didn't think about it carefully.Li Mingjin spoke for his wife and said solemnly, \"If he was the young lady of brothel, we won't care about you. You don't even care about your third sister-in-law's reputation? Fourth brother, you really disappoint me!\"Under the repeated attacks, the fourth prince had to promise on the spot: \"Third brother, I will definitely propose to Luo Shangshu, and I will not ruin the reputation of Luofu and the third sister-in-law!\"Luo Shuyu rolled his sleeves and stepped on the stool that Qingwang handed over. When he got on the carriage, he didn't even look at them.Li Mingjin glanced gloomily at Li Mingchun before returning to the carriage.But Shen Mingyun, who was scolded, only reacted and jumped up and said, \"No! Fourth prince, what are you talking about?\" Why the hell didn't he understand! Propose marriage? What are you talking about?Luo Shuyu, who got into the carriage, saw Li Mingjin came in, and threw himself into his arms, burying his face on his shoulders, his shoulders shaking exaggeratingly.Li Mingjin patted him on the back distressedly: \"Yu'er doesn't cry, I'll make it out for you someday.\"The author has something to say:The Third Prince,: Wife, he's crying again, and I'm really amazing!Luo Shuyu:\u00a0 \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was holding back his laughter until his stomach hurt. Lying on of Li Mingjin, he just didn't want someone to hear his laughter outside.Who would have thought that he and Li Mingjin would go out for hot spring, and on the way back, they would meet the Fourth Prince and Shen Mingyun who quietly returned to the city.How could he be worthy of the sullen anger that had nowhere to vent in his heart if he didn't take a good bite of the fat that was delivered to his door.Next, it depended on the fourth prince. Since he had already promised to propose marriage to Luofu in front of Li Mingjin, to protect the reputation of Luo Shuyu and Shen Mingyun, he would do what he said, but it was not so easy to think about, and he had to prevent Shen Mingyun sabotaged this matter.He always regarded himself as a modern man, with a forward-looking vision, freedom, democracy, and fairness, and he would inevitably object to the proposal of the fourth prince.This was also the reason why Luo Shuyu was angry in front of the fourth prince, and returned to the carriage without giving Shen Mingyun a chance to react, because he couldn't let Shen Mingyun made a decision, his so-called democracy, freedom and fairness were not based on their era, so, Luo Shuyu didn't need to hear his opinion at all, and chose to ignore it was the biggest blow to Shen Mingyun.He would still be with the Fourth Prince in the end, so what's the problem when it happened earlier? It didn't destroy their marriage, but it was to speed up their time together. The more freedom you gave Shen Mingyun, the more he may do things that went too far. When his wings hadn't grown yet, he would be locked in the back house. His fighting spirit and professionalism would gradually worn out. What if there was a system, the reality didn't allow him to do too much.Luo Shuyu suppressed his smile and raised his head from Li Mingjin's arms, with a smile in the corners of his eyes, there was no trace of tears.Li Mingjin looked puzzled: \"You didn't cry?\"Luo Shuyu flattened Li Mingjin's pleated shoulders: \"Why are you crying? For my reputation or for the Luo family?\"Li Mingjin: \"Naturally, it's the reputation of the third prince's imperial concubine.\"\"Your Highness, what is your reputation?\" Luo Shuyu asked him seriously.Li Mingjin thought for a moment: \"...No, but didn't t you just go to see and you wanted to get justice for your reputation?\"Luo Shuyu told him, \"Since I'm married to Your Highness, we are husband and wife. Your Highness doesn't care about reputation. Why should I care about that little reputation? I just want to scold Shen Mingyun, pretend to be angry, and I don't care about reputation.\"Li Mingjin looked at Luo Shuyu, his eyes seemed to be able to see straight into the hearts of others: \"I know I will definitely live up to your expectation.\"Luo Shuyu smiled and said, \"I know that Your Highness will not let me down.\"Li Mingjin asked him: \"How did you know, not afraid that I just lied to you.\"Luo Shuyu: \" I only knew that a god told me.\"Li Mingjin had a smile in his eyes, and suddenly felt that his wife was a little cute, how could he be so good, how could he be unconditional, and he loved him more and more, thinking about him every day. Stayed in his arms, didn't want him to be exposed to the slightest bit of wind and rain, and didn't want him to be bullied by the words of others, and he loved him very much.After returning to the Third Prince's Mansion, Luo Shuyu didn't pay attention to the Fourth Prince and Shen Mingyun on the bright side. He just sent someone to inform Luo Renshou for the matter, and \"instructed\" him to handle this matter well and to have a satisfactory result, otherwise the consequences would be disastrous. A person with such a good face, Luo Renshou, would definitely understand what he meant.Luo Renshou was so angry that he smashed a precious vase after hearing the words brought by the third prince's mansion.He sent someone to call Shen Mingyun to the study and directly questioned how he was with the Fourth Prince.Shen Mingyun felt that he was really wronged. He only made friend with the fourth prince, not falling in love: \"Uncle, the fourth prince and I really have nothing, why don't you believe me? We are just friends.\"Luo Renshou heard he said something similar to what Luo Shuyu told him: \"Friendship? Are you naive or stupid?\"Shen Mingyun frowned and said, \"Why can't it be friend?\" At this time, he felt that he and Luo Renshou really had three different views.Luo Renshou: \"I'm very grateful for the fourth prince to send you back from the Fourth Prince's mansion, but you didn't return home with others all night. Who knows what you did? Fortunately, Shuyu saw you. You never care about these things, so I told you, Mingyun, you disregard the reputation of our Luofu. You, a young ger who hasn't left the cabinet, spent a night with a man. What will the outsiders think? Can you make other promises? What will they think of Shuyu? Mingyun, uncle treats you well, how could you do such a thing!\"This was the second time that Shen Mingyun had been pressed by the word \"ger\". He couldn't refute it yet, this was the rule in the Daxia Kingdom.However, as a traveler, he had an unyielding spirit.Shen Mingyun: \"Uncle, I said I have nothing to do with him, why don't you believe me?\" This old man really didn't want to save face.Luo Renshou didn't want to argue with him: \"I'm doing it for your own good. If the fourth prince comes to propose marriage, I will agree for you.\"Shen Mingyun immediately froze: \"That's not good, I'm the master of my marriage!\"Luo Renshou: \"Do you think this matter will not reach the ears of the Queen and His Majesty? Do you really think that only Shuyu and the third prince who saw it that day? There are so many royal eyes and ears in the capital, you are still seen at the city gate, what the hell are you? Do you know the consequences! Maybe everyone in the capital now knows that my Luo Renshou's nephew can only serve people freely!\"Shen Mingyun: \"Do you want to be so serious? It's just going out for one night.\" He was almost annoyed by Luo Renshou.Luo Renshou's attitude also became tougher: \"In short, you stay in the house for the past few days, and you are not allowed to go anywhere!\"Shen Mingyun: \"Uncle, you are simply unreasonable, I will not marry anyone casually!\" I'm a fucking man! A man married a man, what about the dignity!He also learned to be good, and promised Luo Renshou on the surface. After returning to Youyou Xiaozhu, he began to think about how to leave Luofu. The earth was big, and he could stay anywhere, and where he couldn't mix? After all, he still had a system.Shen Mingyun also asked the system's opinion: \"System, where do you like us to go?\"The system said coldly: \"Host, it's very chaotic outside, your system points are too few now, and it's not enough to save your life.\"Shen Mingyun: \"What? My props not enough to save my life? The money I\u2019ve earned these years is enough for me to live in another city, but it\u2019s not good enough. I\u2019ll go to another country and exchange two pictures from the mall. I still don\u2019t believe that I can\u2019t make a comeback.\u201dThe system: \"Host, staying in the capital is the best choice.\"Shen Mingyun: \"If you stay, you have to marry the fourth prince. I'm a man who wants to marry in, isn't it funny? Yes, and I still can have a baby, if I marry him , what if you win the jackpot?\"The system: \"According to the host's needs, the mall will provide the exchange for contraceptives and condoms.\"Shen Mingyun: \"The system is awesome!\"\"Contraceptive pills, your chance of conceiving is only 0.1%.\"Shen Mingyun: \"That is, as long as I take safety measures, this can be completely avoided?\"System: \"Yes.\"Shen Mingyun: \"Are there any side effects?\"System: \"There shouldn't be any, please trust our technology.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He always trusted the system, so he started to shake.It was not impossible to marry the fourth prince. He was the type of male god he liked. He was gentle and his fingers were long, so that should be pretty good.Shen Mingyun was almost persuaded by the system. However, he was still a little sober at the moment, and he cared more about freedom. When he thougt of being locked in the back house, his heart was also shaken, if he was with the fourth prince day and night, he was not sure whether the fourth prince would find out about the system.Moreover, the two of them were not familiar enough to get married. They exchanged letters several times, met several times, and ate together twice. Last night was considered a date. The fourth prince was indeed a romantic person. Going out of the city to see the stars, reading a lot of books, could speak well, and having a little sense of humor, it was exactly what Shen Mingyun liked.Having this opportunity to marry him, he also thought about whether to give up or reserved his opinion.When Shen Mingyun was entangled, the fourth prince was not at all embarrassed. He did have an interest in Shen Mingyun, not only for his appearance, but also for his special skill. Now there was a reason to directly take Shen Mingyun as his own. A rare opportunity, he was worried before and didn't know how to speak, but now it suit his heart.The fourth prince entered the palace with full sincerity, but the process didn't go as smoothly as he imagined.The Emperor Tiansheng said angrily: \"Li Mingchun, you are so courageous!\"Li Mingchun knelt down directly: \"Father, it was the son who made a mistake, but the son doesn't want to let down the sincerity of Shen Gongzi.\"The Emperor Tiansheng: \"Do you know that the Zhou Guo's envoy will arrive in the capital in a month?\"Li Mingchun's heart skipped a beat: \"I don't know what's father means.\"The Emperor Tiansheng said, \"They want to marry us in Daxia, and this time they sent the princess of Zhou.\"The Emperor Tiansheng told him directly, Li Mingchun was not stupid, hecould understand that he was the most suitable of the few princes at the moment. There were a lot of people in the backyard. If you got a princess to come here, you couldn't make a scene. It was even more impossible for the prince. The Yue family's power was big enough. To help the country, he couldn't block the third child when he just got married, otherwise he could run into the palace every day with his temperament, causing him a headache. This was a strict wife control.Li Mingchun: \"Father,the son wants to be with Shen Gongzi for a lifetime.\"The Emperor Tiansheng snorted coldly: \"It's a good one for a lifetime. This matter is tentative.\"When Li Mingchun came out of the palace, he only felt that the house was leaking. When it rained overnight, he didn't know who to turn for help.He was bound to win Shen Mingyun, but if he couldn't give him the position of the imperial concubine, he wouldn't be happy, it was really embarrassing.\"Princess Zhou?\"Luo Shuyu just learned that Zhou's\u00a0 envoy would bring their country's princess to Daxia to pay tribute in a month.Li Mingjin squeezed into Luo Shuyu's couch and hugged him into his arms: \"Well, it will be in a month.\"Luo Shuyu felt that he was too clingy recently, but he didn't drive him away, so he found a comfortable place to lean against: \"How could it be, their princess comes to have a marriage?\"Li Mingjin put his finger restlessly on Luo Shuyu's thigh: \"Yes, in recent years, there have been large and small conflicts between the two countries, and they have fought twice. Zhou Guo lost two cities, and now they are willing to ask for peace, and they will send the princess to come and have marriage.\"Luo Shuyu shrank his neck and avoided the heat he was blowing. This man really said nonsense, \"Continue to talk about the marriage.\"Li Mingjin made an unreasonable request: \"Let me kiss.\"Luo Shuyu threatened: \"Then I sit on the opposite side.\"Li Mingjin said domineeringly: \" No.\"Luo Shuyu struggled symbolically: \"Then don't tell me.\"Li Mingjin hugged him tightly: \"I said, you don't go.\"Luo Shuyu struggled and had to give up. In fact, it was the love between the two. Since the two had a hole in the room, this must be performed every day.\"Then tell me quickly.\" Luo Shuyu stuffed an orange into Li Mingjin's mouth.Li Mingjin had no choice but to swallow it. Recently, he had been fed fruits and vegetables. He was not so repelled to eat these: \"My father wants the fourth brother to marry Princess Zhou.\"Luo Shuyu was a little surprised: \"Is this set?\" He remembered the book didn't write about the matter of Princess Zhou, the fourth prince was going to marry the princess, what about Shen Mingyun? No, the advantages outweighed the disadvantages, and the Fourth Prince wouldn't be able to survive without the help of Shen Mingyun.Li Mingjin said: \"I'm not sure, but my father has this idea.\"Luo Shuyu: \"That's because there is still a change.\"Li Mingjin: \"Well, the fourth brother mentioned to father that he wants to marry Shen Mingyun.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Is it not going well ?\" This should be expected, no matter how Shen Mingyun said it, it was just an appearance, not a serious gongzi of the Luo family, it would be strange that The Emperor Tiansheng would agree.Li Mingjin: \"Of course, otherwise the fourth brother wouldn't have known so quickly that father wanted him to marry Princess Zhou. Do you know what the fourth brother said to father?\"Luo Shuyu smiled and said, \"What did he say?\"Li Mingjin was fascinated by his calculating smile, but he didn't know what he was calculating, so he kissed the corner of his mouth: \"He said he wanted to have a pair with Shen Mingyun for the rest of his life.\"Luo Shuyu: \"I can't believe that the fourth prince still likes Shen Mingyun so much. He is very specific.\"Li Mingjin: \"But I don't think so. I can't see how much the fourth brother likes Shen Mingyun.\"Luo Shuyu : \"Why do you say that?\"Li Mingjin : \"From childhood to adulthood, when the fourth brother wants to get something, he will be very affectionate, and he will try his best to get it. Father once had a wolf pen sent from Huzhou. He prayed very devoutly in the place where my father passed through the harem, and one day my father passed by and was moved by seeing him like this, so he gave him the pen.\"No wonder the fourth prince in his previous life was able to win the throne with the help of Shen Mingyun, he used to be a very thoughtful person.Luo Shuyu suddenly remembered that the prince of the Zhou Kingdom that Shen Mingyun had hooked up with seemed to be the same type of person as Li Mingchun, but the other party was more fierce and more straightforward.If Li Mingchun gave up Shen Mingyun, then Shen Mingyun would turn to the embrace of the prince of Zhou, and then there might be a confrontation between countries.Luo Shuyu frowned suddenly: \"Your Highness, do you know how many princes in Zhou State?\"Of course Li Mingjin knew since he went to the court every day now, of course he didn't miss the important affairs of the court, but he was just lazy occasionally to keep the image of him doing his right job in front of The Emperor Tiansheng.Li Mingjin: \"What?\"Luo Shuyu: \"Could it be that Princess Zhou and her relatives are just a trap, maybe they want to disintegrate the royal family from within, and now that the matter between the first prince and the crown prince is so noisy, there must be spies in the Zhou kingdom in our Daxia, we probably don't know.\"Li Mingjin: \"But how do they know who Princess Zhou is going to marry?\"Luo Shuyu: \"The embankment of a thousand feet will collapse with the nest of ants; the room of a hundred feet will be burned with the smoke between the gap.\". When the royal family was unstable, it was easy to be exploited, such as the blueprints they used before.Li Mingjin was silent, and Luo Shuyu's words inspired him: \"Yu'er is right, this Princess Zhou must never enter the royal family.\"As soon as he finished speaking, he hooked Luo Shuyu's belt. Luo Shuyu quickly held down the his hand that was digging into: \"Li Mingjin!\"Luo Shuyu patted his claws and said arrogantly: \"Li Mingjin, in broad daylight, I chopped off your claws.\"Li Mingjin kissed his earlobe: \"Don't chop, it can be used.\"Li Mingjin bit his neck and said, \"It's all your fault, you just rubbed against me too many times.\"Luo Shuyu was bitten and burst into tears: \"...\"Always biting his sensitive points, bad guy.At the same time, Shen Mingyun ran away from Luofu with his personal servant, wrapped his baggage.Fuck feudal dross, fuck arranged marriages, I won't get married!He also believed in a sentence: life is precious, love is more expensive, but if it's for freedom, both can be thrown away.The author has something to say:The Third Prince: Wife, it's your turn to bite me today!Luo Shuyu:\u00a0 \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He said that if there was an urgent matter, it was an urgent matter: \"Tell me about it in the study.\"When he entered the study, the butler asked someone to lead the two servants who were both injured, they brought Luo Renshou a bad news that was enough to shock him.Liu Shi is dead!Yes, Liu Shi is dead.She died on the way back to her hometown!The injured servants cried and said that they passed a relatively winding mountain on their way back, and not only their money was robbed by the mountain bandits along the road, but they also killed Liu Shi on the spot. leaving only the two servants who rolled to the side of the mountain because of fear.After Luo Renshou listened, his ears were ringing, his eyes were dizzy, and he fell straight down!Luo Fu soon invited a doctor to treat him.Luo Renshou's sudden fainting alarmed Mrs. Luo, who was teaching Luo Shuyao and others in the courtyard.Mrs. Luo was helped to Luo Renshou's yard, and at this time the most favored\u00a0 Cheng yiniang was taking care of him.\"My son, what's wrong with you?\" Mrs. Luo started to wipe her tears when she saw Luo Renshou with wet handkerchief on his forehead.The Luo family was now relying on Luo Renshou. His eldest brother and younger brother Were all from concubines, and they couldn't help him much. Mrs. Luo could only be anxious.\"Mother, I'm fine, but maybe I didn't sleep well.\" Luo Renshou tried to hide his anxiety. Mrs. Luo didn't know that Liu Shi was sent back to her hometown, she only thought she really went to a nunnery.\"How can it be okay? It's tiring.\" Mrs. Luo accused Cheng yiniang next to him again, \"Everyone is so ignorant, how can you take care of the master!\"Cheng yiniang admitted that she\u00a0 was wrong, and Luo Renshou said for her,\u00a0 saying something that it had nothing to do with her.After that, Mrs. Luo scolded the servant and the concubines who served Luo Renshou one by one before returning to Fushouju.After hearing that Luo Renshou had passed out, Luo Shumo and Luo Shuhan also hurried back. After that, the two learned from Luo Renshou that Liu Shi died at the hands of the bandits, and they were so angry that they turned pale on the spot, and their hands trembled!Luo Shuhan slumped on the chair: \"Mother, mother is gone?\"Luo Renshou covered his forehead and sighed: \"You two will bring your mother's body back tomorrow and give her a glorious funeral.\"It was reasonable to declare that Liu Shi was seriously ill and to hold a funeral now.\"Tomorrow I'll be out of the city.\" Luo Shumo appeared calmer instead: \"Who did it?\"Luo Shuhan said angrily, \"It must be Luo Shuyu!\"Luo Renshou almost smashed him with an inkstone: \"Why do you always take one bite at Shuyu? it's your mother's fault in this matter! And he just got married, so he didn't even know that your mother was arranged to go back to her hometown. I only sent someone to tell him that she go to the nunnery!\"\"Why is this happening? Many people escorted my mother back, I should have gone if I knew!\" Luo Shuhan said in anguish, tears kept streaming down.Luo Shumo was calmer than his younger brother: \"Where did the bandits come from on this road?, and I have never heard of bandits appearing on that section of the road before.\"Luo Renshou said: \"It didn't happen before, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist now, and it is estimated that there is an autumn harvest there. Yes, there are people making trouble again.\"Luo Shuhan said angrily: \"Father, I will definitely take a job to suppress the bandits and avenge my mother!\"The three were discussing the death of Liu Shi, and the servant ran to report the matter to Luo Renshou. The situation was quite urgent.\"It's not good, it's not good, sir!\"\"Father is not healthy, from which yard? Can you speak? Pull it out to hit!\" Luo Shuhan didn't like anyone who saw him now!Luo Renshou raised his hand to stop Luo Shuhan, and said to the servant, \"What's the matter?\"The\u00a0 servant said, \" This servant stared at Shen gongzi as instructed, and he ran away last night!\"Luo Shumo was the first to be puzzled. The news was even more shocking than when he heard about Liu's death: \"What did you say? Shen gongzi ran away?\"Luo Renshou didn't notice Luo Shumo's overreaction for a while. Luo Shuyu told him that the fourth prince would come to propose marriage, but he hadn't mentioned it to the rest of the family, lest Mrs. Luo said that he was partial to Shen Mingyun. This thing really shouldn't be too public, otherwise it would ruin the reputation of their family.For Luo Renshou, it was like a leak in the house and it rained overnight!The fourth prince was about to come to propose marriage, but Shen Mingyun fled at this time? What did he mean by this?He was the one who didn't return home at night with others, and he was the one who ran away. Shen Mingyun really made their Luofu fell into inhumanity and injustice.Luo Renshou was angry and anxious!Luo Shumo asked again, \"Why did my cousin run away? Didn't he just return to the mansion? Where did he go?\" He also knew about him being punished by the Crown Princess before, but he really could only be anxious, \"Father, what do you do to him? What?\"\"I only told him not to go out, he would cause trouble for me every time he went out!\" Luo Renshou was almost turned white by Shen Mingyun's commotion, \"He made a trouble in the Crown Prince's Courtyard, and he has to learn the rules. Hurry up and send someone out to look for him, and I have to tie him back, like a wild boy, who can't go home all day long!\" After all, it was from the country, and there were no rules!Luo Shumo thought it was strange that something could scare Shen Mingyun out of Luofu.After a moment of mourning over Liu's death, the three of them went back to their yard and went about their own business.Luo Shumo inquired about Shen Mingyun's running away from home. When he inquired, his heart was not very good. It turned out that the fourth prince wanted to propose marriage to\u00a0 Luofu?The reason was that he and Shen Mingyun went out for a tryst in the middle of the night and was discovered!Luo Shumo looked incredulous. He knew that cousin Shen was a lively and playful person who had his own set of views on dogma, but he really went out with the fourth prince? Could it be that he was coerced by the fourth prince?But it was impossible. The fourth prince was modest and courteous, and he had a certain degree of advance and retreat. Among all the princes, he was the most observant of the etiquette. How could they go out of the city in the middle of the night for private meetings?Cousin couldn't marry the fourth prince!Luo Shumo was so anxious that he immediately sent someone out to find someone. He wanted to go to Luo Renshou's study to show him that he wanted to marry Shen Mingyun, but his mother had just suffered misfortune, and it was a mess right now. Why did it become like this?was he better than the Fourth Prince?In the past, he had listened to cousin Shen complimenting the Fourth Prince, and when he mentioned it again, his eyes lit up.But why was he unwilling to marry the fourth prince?Could it be that he really just admired the Fourth Prince, not the love between men and women?Thinking of this, Luo Shumo's mood became better again. Maybe his cousin also had affection for him, otherwise how could he allow him to do those intimate actions to him.Luo Shumo couldn't help but thought of the last time they were drinking in the courtyard. Shen Mingyun got a little drunk after drinking a little. Luo Shumo looked at him with attractive red lips and pink cheeks. He, Shen Mingyun, who was drunk or not, responded to him. The two kissed for a long time. He guessed that his cousin must be shy and didn't open his eyes. Thinking of this, Luo Shumo, his heart was full of sweetness.The matter of not going home at night must be the fault of the Fourth Prince.After the exhausted fourth prince had just finished his meal in the mansion, he heard the news from the people in Luofu that Shen gongzi had disappeared.Li Mingchun: ...Shen Mingyun was really interesting. It seemed that he knew that he would be married to the mansion. He disappeared without a trace under his eyes, which proved that he must have something special. It was natural to marry him and returned to the mansion. It was not a loss, he must not let the crown prince or the first prince discovered his abnormality.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The fourth prince didn't track Shen Mingyun, but Luo Shuyu didn't need to track him down. He knew where Shen Mingyun.The secret phrase that Shen Mingyun used to test him before, \"the king of the sky covers the earth tiger, the river demon of the pagoda town\" Was used in his hiding place at this time.He was smart and didn't go out of the town.Most people thought that if they ran away from home, they would go directly out of the city. Shen Mingyun was still a little smart. He knew that the most dangerous place was the safest place. Beside, he didn't run away because of marriage. After all, the fourth prince never proposed to him. It was still in the preparatory stage.But it had to be said that Shen Mingyun was indeed vigilant. The Emperor Tiansheng didn't agree with the fourth prince to marry Shen Mingyun as his imperial concubine. If the fourth prince insisted on marrying him for the reputation of the Luo family, he could only took him as a concubine.In the Daxia Kingdom, a man could marry three wives and four concubines, or he could only marry one. Although the fourth prince claimed to have one pair with him for the rest of his life, it was a concubine in the end, who knew if he would change his mind.And the status of each prince in the royal family was very different. Like the third prince, his mother concubine\u2019s status was special. The Emperor Tiansheng wouldn't allow him to marry an imperial concubine from a strong family. The mother\u2019s family had no background. Therefore, there were two reasons for choosing Luo Shuyu. First, The third prince was humiliated; second, Luo Shangshu had no foundation in the capital. Based on the above two points, for The Emperor Tiansheng, the characters of Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin were compatible, and they were a match made in heaven.Facts proved that the marriage was a good one. After Li Mingjin got married, his enthusiasm for the court increased. The Emperor Tiansheng felt very relieved that they were all good people.On the other hand, the fourth prince was different. Although his mother concubine didn't have a high position and had a poor background, his mother was also from Daxia. He could use his marriage to measure the stability of the court.The identity of Shen Mingyun, who the Fourth Prince wanted to marry now, was even lower. He was a commoner, and he was incomparable to Luo Shuyu, the real gongzi of Luofu.The blueprints he took out were cheap for the crown prince. He didn't put on the title of the most beautiful in the world in front of The Emperor Tiansheng as he did in his previous life. Now he was only a distant relative of Luofu, with a low status, and the fourth prince wanted to marry him. Being the Imperial Concubine was even more difficult than ascending to the sky, and the only way to enter the Fourth Prince's Mansion was to become his concubine.Luo Shuyu was not worried, he knew where Shen Mingyun was, and things were still under his control.After he sent someone to determine Shen Mingyun's location, he began to arrange the next things, step by step.To make them husband and wife ahead of time, it was natural to use some means. Shen Mingyun's informality gave him a chance.He made some friends outside the world. These people had done everything, but they were not good people. However, Shen Mingyun liked to call them brothers and sisters. Everyone killed without blinking an eye, burnt, loot, and did everything.With these people, Shen Mingyun inevitably had to spend money to treat guests for dinner, with big fish and meat, good wine and good food to serve, and he was going to pay them to escort him out of the city.Shen Mingyun lived there for two days. At first, he was afraid that the Luo family would find him, but in fact, Luo Shumo was in the wrong direction and never found him, so he relaxed.He lived in the north part of the city. This place was chaotic. There were people from all three religions and nine streams. The so-called fireworks and willow alleys were different from the four major brothels in the capital.Shen Mingyun, a beautiful ger who lived here, had long been targeted.He was not only rich, but also beautiful. His small waist was very attractive. He was simply a huge moving target for the unscrupulous people. A few people who were brothers with Shen Mingyun were even more crooked. They not only wanted to rob money, but also wanted to put him to sleep.On the third night, as soon as Shen Mingyun fell asleep, those who were in the same yard with him started their actions.Fortunately, the system woke up Shen Mingyun and told him to quickly use the stealth prop!The people in Jianghu took away a small part of the money. Shen Mingyun originally only needed to lose some money and went there, but he didn't expect that those guys gave him soft muscle powder and aphrodisiac at dinner!This fucking thing wanted to rob money and rob him!If it wasn't for the system still in place, Shen Mingyun would have really lost both money and manpower!Before those people left, Shen Mingyun's props couldn't last long, he felt short of breath again, his body was hot, and all he thought about was men.His moaning was still heard by the people in jianghu, and a strong man who had always thought about him came over, rubbing his hands.Shen Mingyun's props were invalid!The strong man found his hiding place: \"So you are here, Mingyun, look, you usually call us\u00a0 big brother. Now that big brother is in need, please satisfy us as well, hehe.\"Shen Mingyun scolded angrily: \"Go away ! \"The strong man pinched his chin: \"Little beauty, tonight I will let you taste the power of your big brother, you want it once and even want the second time, the aftertaste is endless!\"Only then did Shen Mingyun understood, he was very flustered: \"...Trash, get out!\"He kept shouting to the system in his head: \"System, save me! What's wrong with me?\"The system: \"You should be in the influence of aphrodisiac.\"The strong man's pair of salty pig hands began to touch Shen Mingyun!\"Go away! Go away! Don't touch Lao Tzu! Lao Tzu is a man!\"The belt fell to the ground with the sound, and it was half unfastened. When Shen Mingyun really thought he was finished, a warm liquid suddenly smeared on his face!Yes, blood!The one he usually called \"Third Brother\" fell in a pool of blood, and standing in front of him was the Fourth Prince with a sword!Shen Mingyun was now afraid and said: \"Fourth Prince...Save me...\"Li Mingchun immediately took off his robe and put it on him, and carried him back to the Fourth Prince's Mansion.On the way back, Li Mingchun found that something was wrong with Shen Mingyun, his eyes wandered, and he kept moaning alluringly.Obviously, this was an aphrodisiac.After returning to the fourth prince, Li Mingchun directly took Shen Mingyun back to his bedroom.Shen Mingyun tugged at his sleeve: \"Li Mingchun, help me...\"Li Mingchun didn't hesitate to tear off the only remaining clothes.At this time, Shen Mingyun was already dying, and there was no time to wonder why Li Mingchun agreed to him without hesitation, and he never thought about finding an antidote to help him solved his troubles.In short, the two spent an endless night of spring night.Luo Shuyu was tossed by Li Mingjin all night, and when he woke up, he found that he was not alone, with his head resting in Li Mingjin's arms, and the other party was still sleeping.Made you restless every night, tired.The next moment, Luo Shuyu met a pair of bright eyes.Well, he underestimated the man's physical strength.Li Mingjin kissed Luo Shuyu's forehead: \"Is there any discomfort?\" He touched the place where he used too much last night.\"No!\" Luo Shuyu lifted his hand, \"I got up.\"Li Mingjin smiled lowly: \"Yu'er will still be shy.\"\"I'm thin-skinned, unlike some people whose skin is thicker than the city wall.\" And now it was getting thicker and thicker, and the walls were iron and steel.Li Mingjin stuck to him: \"Yu'er has learned to kill me.\" But he didn't feel wronged at all.Luo Shuyu smiled and pushed away someone chest who was approaching, but Li Mingjin didn't let him push him away. He slipped his hands over his head and arched them around his neck. Luo Shuyu was tickled by him and couldn't help but laugh.Luo Shuyu couldn't move because of him, so he had to shout, \"Hey, hey, don't mess around!\"\"If I don't mess around, you just don't remember.\" He wanted to hug Luo Shuyu, soft and fragrant.The two got up after arguing for a while, and the servants waited for them to get up and had breakfast.Just after breakfast, He heard from Anjiu about the movement of Shen Mingyun.Li Mingjin took a break today, and the two painted in the study. He read the note first, but he didn't understand what it meant: \"Is it done? What does it mean?\"Luo Shuyu prepared the ink and said, \"Your Highness begs me, and I will tell you.\"Li Mingjin narrowed his eyes, he threw down the note decisively, threw away the ink in his hand, wrapped one arm around his waist, bullied him, pressed him on the desk with the tip of his nose against the tip of Luo Shuyu's nose, pretending to be viciously threatened: \"If you don't tell me, I will rectify the law on the spot.\"Luo Shuyu was not afraid of him at all, and took the initiative to kiss his lips, and said in a longer tone, \"Then, you, come.\"In Li Mingjin's opinion, this was an invitation. Wife's requirements, naturally to meet!A quarter of an hour later, Luo Shuyu bit his lip and leaned against the edge of the table, extremely regretful of being strong for a while, and understood a truth, don't make the man who has opened the meat excited .Li Mingjin is really too much!The author has something to say:The Third prince: Little beauty, let you taste the power of your big brother at night!Luo Shuyu:\u00a0 \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He also mentioned this to Li Mingjin, hoping that he would send someone to pay attention to their actions.Li Mingjin approached Luo Shuyu and coaxed him twice, but the other party just didn't give him a good face, so he had to touch his nose and rode to the street to buy him some snacks.Luo Shuyu was naturally not idle, and asked people to replace the thin curtains in the house with the thick ones. The winter was coming, and the mansion had to be arranged.Recently , he also observed the four maids who were arranged by him to do rough work in the main courtyard. The four of them were able to bear it, and they still hadn't shown their feet.The two were now close to each other, trusted each other, and were more intimate than ever before. As long as Luo Shuyu felt suspicious, he would mention it to Li Mingjin.The four maids were not found to be wrong for the time being, but a sneaky one was dug out from the dining room. After the interrogation, the other party admitted that he was sent by the crown prince. There was something wrong. Li Mingjin calmly dealt with the person. But it was difficult to judge whether the content of the interrogation was true or false.Maybe someone wanted to put the blame on the crown prince. The crwn prince was in the limelight recently. Of course, it may also be the fourth prince who would secretly play tricks.None of Li Mingjin's brothers we're good.There was an autumn rain yesterday, the wind blew, the temperature dropped a lot, and the exhaled air began to be foggy.Autumn passed quickly, and it changed in the blink of an eye.Luo Shuyu also asked the servants to prepare winter clothes for winter, and store more food for winter in the cellar.Most of the royal family's life was extravagant, but what they should store should still be stored, and what they couldn't save was not to save.At this time in his last life, Luo Shuyu hadn't yet left the cabinet, and he heard that many people were unable to eat because of the locust plague this year.There may be a large number of refugees heading to the capital in winter, and at that time he would serve porridge in the name of the Third Prince's Mansion.After thinking about it, he was at a loss. To tell Li Mingjin about this, and let the court found a way. Even if he went to cook porridge, the fundamental problem couldn't be solved.What refugees needed was winter to stop, not porridge and water for two or three days, which could only solved their urgent needs.The book didn't say that Shen Mingyun went to rescue the victims. There was only a story about him being robbed of his purse by a refugee beggar, but this beggar only appeared to make him meet the Prince of Zhou, and nothing else was mentioned.Li Mingjin bought a few roasted sweet potatoes from outside, and they were still warm when they arrived in Luo Shuyu's hands.Luo Shuyu noticed that the palm of his hand was burning red, and he wondered: \"Where did Your Highness find the stall?\"Li Mingjin said vaguely: \"Just, just go for a walk.\"Luo Shuyu put the sweet potato aside, took his hand and looked at it , and took the initiative to untie his clothes.Li Mingjin took a step back: \"Yu'er, what are you doing?\" He was still angry with him in the morning.Luo Shuyu said fiercely with a stern face: \"It's getting colder today. It will take a quarter of an hour to go back to our house from the street with riding a fast horse. How can you keep the sweet potato so hot?\" .Li Mingjin didn't pull Luo Shuyu's hand away, and he saw that his chest was red with burns.Luo Shuyu gave him a roll of eyes: \"Are you an idiot?\" Turning his head, he asked Qingwang to bring him a scald cream to remove the redness and swelling.Li Mingjin's eyes flickered: \"It's not a big deal, it's just a little bit red.\"Luo Shuyu suddenly pressed hard on his red and swollen spot, and Li Mingjin let out a hiss.\"It doesn't hurt even if it's red.\" He took the scalding ointment handed by Qingwang and gently rubbed it on the redness spot on his chest.The cold cream was evenly applied to Li Mingjin's skin. On the other hand, he watched Luo Shuyu worry about him, and his heart was warm.But Luo Shuyu's next sentence sent him to hell: \"Your Highness makes me worry, so I'll sleep on the couch at night.\"Li Mingjin resisted in a low voice: \"Don 't.\"Luo Shuyu pulled his clothes back and looked up at him: \" Don't go back from your word, do what you say .\"Li Mingjin continued to struggle: \"Then I refuse?\" How can I sleep on the couch?Luo Shuyu: \"Then I'll sleep on the couch.\"Li Mingjin: \"...\" Let me sleep.For dinner, there were roasted sweet potatoes that Li Mingjin bought. Luo Shuyu ate half of it, and Li Mingjin took care of the rest.Before going to bed, Luo Shuyu personally spread the couch, and Li Mingjin dawdled to lie down, his eyes extremely aggrieved.After the candle was extinguished, Li Mingjin's voice came from the darkness: \"Yu'er, are you cold?\"Luo Shuyu knew what Li Mingjin was thinking as soon as he heard it: \"It's not cold.\"After a while, Li Mingjin asked him again: \"Yu'er, are you sleeping?\"Luo Shuyu: \" I' m about to fall asleep, so hurry up and sleep.\"Li Mingjin: \"But I can't sleep.\"Luo Shuyu: \" even if you can't sleep, you have to sleep, how you can sleep in the past is how you sleep now .\"Li Mingjin: \"But...\"Luo Shuyu: \"Huh?\"Li Mingjin: \"Yu'er, I was wrong.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Where did you go wrong?\"Li Mingjin: \"I shouldn't make fun of my body, I don't care about my body, Let you worry.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Then will you commit it again next time?\"Li Mingjin: \"I don't dare to commit it, can I go back to bed?\"Luo Shuyu: \"Reflect on yourself for a night.\"Li Mingjin: \"...\"Luo Shuyu hugged the quilt and raised the corners of his mouth, although Li Mingjin was not on the bed, but there was his breath around, Luo Shuyu slept peacefully.In the middle of the night, Luo Shuyu fell into a warm embrace, and Li Mingjin still quietly reached the bed.It was impossible to sleep on the couch when you just got married.In the morning, when Luo Shuyu woke up, he heard the movement outside.Qingwang reminded him: \"Gongzi, Your Highness is practicing martial arts today. Would you like to take a look?\"\"Practicing martial arts?\" He had never seen Li Mingjin practicing martial arts in the main courtyard. In the past, he would compete with the guards in the martial arts field. He practiced in the yard, and he wanted to see it, he had never seen it in his previous life.Today was cloudy and a little windy.Ansan, who was standing by the side, quietly gave Li Mingjin a gesture: \"Your Highness, the imperial concubine is here! The Tai Chi sword you just practiced is the most elegant, hurry up!\"The door opened, and Li Mingjin immediately changed his sword path.What Luo Shuyu saw immediately was Li Mingjin, who was wearing a training suit, practicing his sword, moving like flowing water.But he was a little puzzled, didn't Li Mingjin usually use the whip? He didn't expect him to be able to use sword, it was really pretty.Li Mingjin's every move was injected with strength, the robe swayed with the movement, and the fluttering fairy just didn't match his serious handsome face.How the hell did he come up with the sword dance ?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Today,The Emperor Tiansheng was going to the school grounds to watch the annual competition of the guards. All princes had to be present, and Li Mingjin must also go, didn't need to rush him.As the third child, it would be better for him to keep a low profile and not be noticed, so The Emperor Tiansheng had some kind of father-son affection for him. After he was consumed by the others, he would know who the\u00a0 son deserved the most attention.This was Luo Shuyu's initial plan, which coincided with Li Mingjin's idea.Not long after Li Mingjin left, someone from Luofu sent a letter from Luo Renshou. After reading it, Luo Shuyu was in a good mood.This fourth prince finally did something very pleasing, and he still accepted Shen Mingyun.The Fourth Prince had sex with Shen Mingyun without hesitation that night, thinking that he also wanted to tie Shen Mingyun. If this was the case, then the fourth prince was really dangerous. He observed the man with a deep mind, and he understood Shen Mingyun very well. Everything was written on his face.The special thing was that he didn't know anything. After all, Shen Mingyun's self-awareness was very poor. It could be seen that the pursuit of Shen Mingyun by the fourth prince in the previous life was actually a conspiracy. Thinking of Shen Mingyun's admiration, love, distress, worry for the fourth prince in the book, and finally gave everything for him, Luo Shuyu felt a little funny, he didn't even know what kind of person was next to him.In fact, the aphrodisiac had an antidote and didn't need to be practiced. The fourth prince must have other plans for Shen Mingyun. Thinking of what Li Mingjin mentioned when he was a child, he reasonably doubted whether the fourth prince knew about Shen Mingyun's special features. Took advantage of him and gained his power.Luo Shuyu read the entire novel, but there was no follow-up of the novel, only the part where Shen Mingyun became the empress, as for whether they really spent a hundred years together, it was unknown.Today's fourth prince and Shen Mingyun had made progress, but their mutual trust level was not as good as in the previous life. They rashly got together, and he didn't know what kind of conflict would arise.Luo Renshou told Luo Shuyu that the fourth prince was going to take Shen Mingyun into the door, and he promised Luo Renshou that he would carry Shen Mingyun as his wife in the future.The premise of being a flat wife was that the fourth prince had his own imperial concubine, which meant that as long as Shen Mingyun was still unknown, The Emperor Tiansheng would decide the marriage for the fourth prince.After running away from Luofu, Shen Mingyun suffered a huge blow after being drugged and having skin-to-skin relationship with Li Mingchun. He admired Li Mingchun and thought about his figure, but he didn't expect that It was in this situation that he had this kind of relationship with the other party!The whole person was broken!But fortunately, he could still accept the fourth prince, but in the end he was still \"stabbed\", and he was unwilling.A few days ago, he was discussing with the system about all kinds of things after marriage. Now it was alright, just skipped it. During that process, the two didn't take any protective measures. Not only that, when he came out of the Fourth Prince's Mansion, he was seen by many people, and he couldn't even speak clearly.After weighing it, the fourth prince let him enter the mansion, and then made up the wedding.Under the pressure of Luo Renshou, Shen Mingyun could only agree. He had no choice. What happened that night before Li Mingchun appeared made him frightened, and he was almost eaten by a group of mad dogs.Fortunately, as long as the fourth prince was devoted to him and had the support of him and the system, becoming a crown prince and crown princess was just around the corner.Then he could also write a \"promotion of the imperial concubine\" for himself.Hey, if it hadn't been seen (by others), Shen Mingyun could think that he hadn't spent the night with Li Mingchun, and now it was hard to ride a tiger, even if he didn't enter the Fourth Prince's Mansion.The system couldn't help Shen Mingyun in this regard, he could only provide props and tasks, and gave him some suggestions when necessary.Shen Mingyun looked at a set of high-quality wedding dresses that were casually placed on the table, and began to blame the system: \"You said that if you were more powerful, you should remind me earlier that those people have bad character, and do I still need to get angry here?\"The system: \"...\"Shen Mingyun worried again: \"I won't get pregnant! Fuck!\"The System: \"The mall has put contraceptives and condoms on the shelves, and the host can buy according to their own needs.\"Shen Mingyun thought about the Fourth Prince, although the time was not too long, but he still had a lot of times, so he could barely accept it.While he was researching which condoms and medicines were more cost-effective, Luo Shumo was arguing with Luo Renshou in the study, and it was for Shen Mingyun!Luo Shumo: \"Father, how can you send Mingyun to the Fourth Prince's Mansion so hastily!\"Luo Renshou: \"Why not, what he did can't even be covered by a fig leaf, how many times he came out of the Fourth Prince's Mansion that morning? Did anyone see it?\"Luo Shumo : \"Father, I want to marry Mingyun.\"Luo Renshou slapped him in the face: \"Your mother just passed away, do you still want to marry Shen Mingyun? He is wilder than anyone else. He used the blueprint to hook up with the first prince, now he is with the fourth prince, how can he be liked by you! Our Luofu can't tolerate his big Buddha!\"Luo Shumo stubbornly knelt on the ground: \"He has no father or mother, if he doesn't fight for himself, Who else can help him?\"Luo Renshou said firmly: \"In short, I won't agree to him becoming my daughter-in-law, and it's impossible!\"Luo Shumo finally left Luo Renshou's study unhappily, and went to Shen Mingyun's Youyou Xiaozhu.The arrival of Luo Shumo added some color to Shen Mingyun's face.But as soon as Luo Shumo entered the door, he hugged Shen Mingyun tightly and kissed his lips: \"Mingyun, don't marry the fourth prince, I'll take you away! \"What does it mean?Shen Mingyun pushed him away: \"Cousin, cousin, I only think of you as a cousin, there is no love, don't mess around!\"Luo Shumo pressed him on the bed: \"No, Mingyun, last time you drank with me, if you don't like me, why would you kiss me back!\"Shen Mingyun was even more confused: \"Cousin, you misunderstood, I really didn't respond to you, maybe when I was drunk, I thought it was my dog kissing me... \"\"You lied to me, you have never raised a dog!\" Luo Shumo tore his clothes frantically, almost uncontrollably about to invade Shen Mingyun!Fortunately, Shen Mingyun struggled hard: \"Fuck, you lunatic, let me go!\"Slap!Shen Mingyun slapped Luo Shumo's face!\"You see a doctor when you're sick, don't you understand people's words?\"Luo Shumo's last sanity was turned back by this slap, and he finally regained his senses. He shook his head with a wry smile: \"It turns out that I have always been self-indulgent...\"Then he staggered away from Youyou Xiaozhu.Shen Mingyun immediately had the courtyard door locked!fuck! Almost my chrysanthemum!When the Luo family's love and hatred were in chaos, Luo Shuyu in the Third Prince's Mansion was relatively leisure.He asked Qingwang to take out the dusty guqin, wiped it once, sit down and thinking about playing a song for Li Mingjin at night. The two of them drinking a little wine or dancing with the sword.Thinking about it makes me happy.Only halfway through a piece of music, a guard beside Li Mingjin begged to see Luo Shuyu.Luo Shuyu's hand was half-dangling, his heart skipped a beat, and he asked him, \"What's the matter, is there something wrong with Your Highness?\" Locked up!\"Hearing this, Luo Shuyu stood up: \"His Royal Highness hurt people? How could he hurt people? Where is he locked up?, is he injured?\"I have never encountered this in my last life, what happened?The author has something to say:The Third Prince: wife, I'm fine, look, I can stand up straight!Luo ShuyuPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Occasionally, he heard about Li Mingjin's smuggling deeds from the outside, and he was indeed scared when he heard it.Their relationship had been developing smoothly in this life, so he neglected this matter, only thought it was a rumor, but now the fact told him that things were not so simple, it was true that Li Mingjin would whip people.Yes, it's actually happening now.Since the two got married, the Li Mingjin in Luo Shuyu's eyes was indifferent to his servants, but he didn't beat or scold them. If it was not pleasing to the eye, they were sent away by Steward Sun. He had never seen him beat people, or even scolded them. Treating Luo Shuyu with such a good temper, let himself sleep on the couch without getting angry, but instead learnt from others to do sword dance early in the morning to make him happy.How could such a gentle Li Mingjin whip someone with a whip? There must be something happening that he didn't know.What could it be?Why would you whip someone with a whip on the school grounds where there was The Emperor Tiansheng?What was Li Mingjin's state at that time, was he awake or not, was he stimulated or did he take the initiative?Luo Shuyu asked the guard, \"You weren't there when Your Highness hurt someone?\"The Guard: \"We are all isolated outside. Your Highness is standing with the others. The crown prince, the first prince and others are all there.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Tell me about what you know.\"The Guard: \"Yes.\"First, The one who came back to inform Luo Shuyu about the matter was Jiang Guard, who was always with Li Mingjin. This person was plain in appearance, and he wouldn't be given a second glance when walking in the crowd. He would answer whatever Luo Shuyu asked him.What he knew was also known by the other guards.At that time, Li Mingjin sat on the top with the crown prince and others to watch the competition on the school field.Most of those who served in the Imperial Guard were young talents in the capital, who had done a good job and had the ability. If The Emperor Tiansheng looked at him, he could also be a guard in the imperial guard.Most of these people were related to court officials, some may be in line, some were not.During the competition of the Imperial Guards in the previous years, The Emperor Tiansheng would also send several princes to practice their skills. All the princes of the Daxia Kingdom had skill both civil and military, and naturally had the ability to protect themselves.The same was true this year. The Emperor Tiansheng was looking forward to several adult princes to show their talents on the stage and fought for their Li family.The fourth prince went up first, then the third prince, then the first prince, and finally the crown prince.The fourth prince Li Mingchun's martial arts were not bad or good, and he could be tied with the opponent. The Emperor Tiansheng's face was not so good.Then there was the third prince, Li Mingjin. He was always short-tempered, and because of his good martial arts, he swept the other party down not long after he came to the stage, and he didn't show any sympathy. The Emperor Tiansheng applauded with satisfaction.The Emperor Tiansheng also boasted: \"Ming Jin's kung fu seems to have improved.\"The officials on the side followed suit.For the third prince and the fourth prince, it was actually just throwing a piece of advice. Everyone actually wanted to see The Emperor Tiansheng's attitude towards the first prince and the crown prince, and praised who was good and who was bad, and the good side could show off to the bad side.After comparing martial arts, the four princes also left the field to the place for archeryAnd when the four princes went to get their bows and arrows, the third prince suddenly kicked someone for no reason.The person who was kicked was the son of the commander of the Imperial Guards!The person standing next to The Emperor Tiansheng was the commander of the Imperial Guard. His son was kicked by the son of the man beside him. Not only him, but also the others. Li Mingjin was so blatant that he wouldn't take The Emperor Tiansheng as his father. In his eyes, it was so daring.This was how the things happened, but only a few people who were present knew exactly how Li Mingjin was drawn.Luo Shuyu pondered for a while, he could only know the truth of the matter when he saw Li Mingjin.Now who could help him to bring Li Mingjin back?Naturally, The Emperor Tiansheng wouldn't be cruel to his son, but no one knew where he was locked up and who was guarding Li Mingjin, and it was even more unclear what would happen next.Luo Shuyu made a direct decision. This person knew Li Mingjin best and was the closest to The Emperor Tiansheng. He wanted to find Concubine Mei.On the surface, Concubine Mei didn't seem to care about Li Mingjin, but that was the surface only. Every time she planted something new, if it was delicious, she would definitely send a copy to the Third Prince's Mansion. The\u00a0 son who was conceived in October, how could you don't care when you said you didn't care.The matter had came to this point, neither Luo Shuyu nor Concubine Mei could stay out of it, and must deal with it with full points of energy.Maybe others would say it was just a trivial matter. Didn't Li Mingjin often beat people? The Emperor Tiansheng locked him up for two days, and when he calmed down, he would be released naturally. Wasn't he the prince? He could come out naturally, so why you needed to worry?But Luo Shuyu was not one of those people. He knew that something was wrong, so he couldn't just watch Li Mingjin being bullied and ignored him. His people was protected by him. This was the meaning of his rebirth!After handing over the sign and entering the palace, Luo Shuyu went directly to Concubine Mei.Concubine Mei was extremely surprised by Luo Shuyu's arrival.Luo Shuyu didn't have bad relationship with her, and also didn't have a deep relationship, so it was better to get straight to the point. What's more, the things were urgent now, and there must be no mistakes. He couldn't bear the pain of losing Li Mingjin, and he couldn't let him get hurt at all! He was afraid!Every time he remembered the injury, he would recall the unbearable past, and the Li Mingjin who was pierced by thousands of arrows and turned into a bloody man to protect him. He couldn't lose him, he couldn't watch him get hurt, even if it was because of The Emperor Tiansheng!Luo Shuyu directly explained the reason why he entered the palace: \"Mother concubine, I disturb you when\u00a0 I come in a hurry, but the things were urgent, I hope you can help His Highness.\"Seeing that Luo Shuyu's worried expression didn't seem to be fake, she wiped her hands with the handkerchief.\"What's the matter with you?\"Luo Shuyu told her about Li Mingjin injured someone in the game, and then asked her: \"Mother concubine, has this kind of thing happened to His Highness before?.\"concubine Mei frowned slightly: \"Yes , his temper has always been bad, and occasionally he will be extremely irritable, which will hurt people, your father has locked him up several times, and he will always be released after two days.\"Luo Shuyu said anxiously: \"Mother concubine didn't think there was any problem with this? His Highness didn't show any signs of being irritable when he went out in the morning. He always has a good temper these days when we are married, and I have never seen him lose his temper. I don't believe he really has a problem.\"Concubine Mei patted his arm and pulled him inside: \"Don't worry, come in with me and have a cup of tea, the tea I just made it myself. Don't worry, Mingjin will be fine.\" Before entering the room, Concubine Mei gave the maid next to her a look.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the late autumn, it was very uncomfortable to be locked up without food or drink. What should he do if he got sick? He didn't have Shen Mingyun's all-inclusive pills.Concubine Mei looked at Luo Shuyu, and said after a while, \"I'll try it, but it may not be successful. In the past, whenever he fell ill, His Majesty would lock him up for fear that he would hurt others.\"Luo Shuyu said coldly, \"But even if he want to lock him up. He will be locked in the Prince's Palace, and I will take care of him, with me, he won't hurt others, I promise.\"Concubine Mei glanced at him and trusted Luo Shuyu a little more: \"I see.\"She looked up at hit , \"You go back to the mansion first and wait for my news.\"Luo Shuyu whispered to Concubine Mei before leaving: \"Mother concubine, I don't want His Highness to suffer from illness again in the future, I will cure him.\"After Luo Shuyu walked away, Concubine Mei stared at the fresh vegetable plant ada that had just grown: \"How to treat it? If it can be cured, I would have cured him already.\"Luo Shuyu hurried back to the mansion, he believed Concubine Mei, if she Come forward, Li Mingjin should be able to return to the mansion.even The Emperor Tiansheng knew about his illness.Why didn't he know anything in his previous life!How good Li Mingjin was to him in his previous life, he didn't even let him know about it.No wonder Li Mingjin in his previous life often slept in the study room, and he was nowhere to be seen. It would take several days once he went out. He asked the servants around him, all of them would say that they didn't know where he was going. It turned out because of this incident!How could he ignore him in his previous life!Luo Shuyu was both sad and uncomfortable, and he was feeling sad when someone suddenly blocked his way in front of him.\"Isn't this the third sister-in-law? Why did you enter the palace at this point?\"The person who came was the Crown Princess who just came out of the Queen's Palace. Looking at her appearance, he knew that she was in a good mood now.Luo Shuyu suppressed his inner anxiety: \"Come into the palace to see the mother concubine.\"\"Oh? It's not for the third brother, right?\"Luo Shuyu twitched the corners of his mouth and said, \"Why do you need to ask when the crown princess knows?\"Yan Wandie covered her mouth, she smiled and said: \"Hey, you say, is it better for a man to have a madness and an empty backyard, or is it better for a man to be healthy but with three wives and four concubines?\"Seeing the Crown Princess's radiant smile, Luo Shuyu looked at her with a half-smile but not a smile, leaned into her ear and said, \"The Crown Princess must be living a very comfortable life now. You and His Royal Highness have a deep relationship, which is very enviable. I heard that His Majesty recently talked about wanting to hug his grandson, the Crown Princess and His Royal Highness, it's been almost two years of marriage, right?\"The Crown Princess heard this, her face turned blue and white, and he was actually laughing at her for not being able to have children!Luo Shuyu was in a bad mood today. The Crown Princess bumped into him like an idiot. The most annoying thing was met the people who showed off in front of him every day!The Crown Princess took a deep breath and glared at him: \"Hmph, you even dare to say this to me, let's see if you can give birth first!\"\"Then don't bother the Crown Princess, the Third Highness is working hard. I hope His Royal Highness can work harder on the Crown Princess.\" Luo Shuyu sneered, then walked straight passed the Crown Princess and left the palace!This Yan Wandie really had no bearing at all. It was not an exaggeration to say that she has a small belly . He didn't know how the queen dowager and the emperor took a fancy to her. Perhaps because she was the prime minister's granddaughter and had a noble status? Looking at her appearance, she wasn't very noble, but with Shen Mingyun, she was somewhat similar.The Crown Princess stomped her feet on the spot angrily. Everyone saw that she and the Crown Prince seemed to be of the same mind, but only she knew that the Crown Prince's thought was not on her at all, but the Queen dowager and the Queen were pressing them.In the past, when no one mentioned it to her, she deceived herself and could live on, but now her wounds were suddenly dug up, and her whole body was full of fissures.Damn Luo Shuyu, he knew that poking her sore would make him look good one day!But now the third prince had to ask for more blessings, hum!Luo Shuyu in the previous life could sympathize with anyone, or didn't care about anything.But this life wouldn't work, Li Mingjin was the one he would spend his whole life with, and he was the one he wanted to protect, no one could say anything bad about him!Even if the queen satirized Li Mingjin in front of him today, he would scold her back as he was, and used his own way to treat her, otherwise he wouldn't be able to swallow it!Luo Shuyu returned to the mansion with a cold expression. When the servants saw him, they seemed to see another third prince.After Luo Shuyu entered the Third Prince's Mansion, the management of the servants became stricter day by day. Whoever dared to disclose the affairs of the mansion, what awaited them was not beaten to death with a stick, but directly kicked out of the mansion and sent their contract to be sold. No mercy at all.Don't look at the gentle and clear face of the third prince, but he wasn't good at all. He disdained the backyard methods, he had a sword in his hand, and you could stay in the mansion for many years, relying on selling the old feeling? sorry, there was no such treatment in the mansion of the Third Prince.That kind of rule that the servant and the master ate at the same table was probably only available in the Fourth Prince's Mansion where Shen Mingyun was located.He really wanted to know how the fourth prince at that time endured it.Luo Shuyu instructed the housekeeper to take care of the servants' mouths, and then returned directly to the main courtyard.He couldn't wait for concubine Mei's news now, he needed to do something.Back in the study where Li Mingjin's breath was everywhere, Luo Shuyu recalled the content of the book, but there was nothing about Li Mingjin's illness in it. Everyone only knew that he was bad-tempered, violent, and cruel, and the truth was all buried in the love process of the protagonist Shen Mingyun.Since Luo Shuyu already knew that there was nothing in the book about Li Mingjin's illness, why did he still recall it?Because he remembered that there was a genius doctor in the book. In the book, Shen Mingyun followed the fourth prince to go to the front line. Unfortunately, the fourth prince was poisoned. Shen Mingyun was very lucky and met a genius doctor. The process was probably because the genius doctor took a fancy to a pill in his hand, he made a deal with Shen Mingyun, the genius doctor helped the fourth prince to detoxify, and Shen Mingyun gave the magic pill in his hand to the genius doctor. In fact, what the genius doctor got was just a sugar-coated pill, because Shen Mingyun had the props to cover up the taste of the medicine, and the pill was colorless and odorless when it arrived in the hands of the genius doctor, so the genius doctor didn't smell the ordinary medicinal ingredients inside.Shen Mingyun used the pills to deceive the genius doctor and got lucky with the help of the other party, and relieved the poison on the fourth prince.From here, the fourth prince began to emerge, and made his name in front of The Emperor Tiansheng.Now, if Li Mingjin was really poisoned, where should he go to find this genius doctor?At present, there was only the name of \"Jie Baidu\". This person was a famous traveling doctor who traveled abroad for many years without a fixed place.As the night approached, the Third Prince's Mansion began to hold the lights.Facing a table of dishes with no appetite, Luo Shuyu couldn't even swallow the soup when Li Mingjin was not there.As soon as he picked up the chopsticks, Grandma Feng came in and told him: \"Master, His Highness is back!\"Luo Shuyu threw down the chopsticks: \"Where is the people? Where is he?\"Grandma Feng hesitated: \"Master, don't get excited when you see it later.\"\"What happened to him?\"\"His Royal Highness...\"Luo Shuyu didn't want to listen to her continued intermittent explanation, and rushed outside.As soon as he rushed out, he saw Ansan and Ansi holding the man with blood on his clothes and his forehead!The other party reluctantly pulled the corner of his mouth at him, and said weakly, \"Don't worry, I'm back.\"Li Mingjin, who had reported of being safe, fainted as soon as he finished speaking.Luo Shuyu rushed forward with red eyes, and said in a panic: \"Li Mingjin! You can't die! You have to give me a good life!\"The author has something to say:The Third Prince: Me! Hold me! wife, come on!Luo Shuyu: ...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Luo Shuyu was so anxious that he immediately sent someone to ask for an imperial doctor.He tried hard to restrain the desire to cry, cut off Li Mingjin's blood-stained clothes, wrung a towel with warm water to wipe off the blood stains on his body, and tried hard not to let the wound get infected. In that novel, he also learned that wound infection could easily lead to people's condition worsened.After the imperial doctor came, he threw Li Mingjin's blood-stained clothes into the brazier and burned it. He couldn't see any blood stains on Li Mingjin's clothes. He was afraid. The unspeakable pain from the previous life.The imperial doctor came in a hurry, and he also brought medicine for the wound. Luo Shuyu sent someone to ask the imperial doctor and directly told him the specific situation, so as not to delay the diagnosis and treatment.During the time when the imperial doctor gave medicine to Li Mingjin, Luo Shuyu was thinking about whether the movement he made was hurting others or himself.The skin injury looked shocking but not serious. Luo Shuyu also found that he still had bruises on his wrist because of rope , and there was also a bump on his forehead, which was also bleeding, the wound was not big, just a little blood, almost frightened him.After the imperial doctor's diagnosis and treatment, he told Luo Shuyu that all the skin injuries on the third prince's body were not serious problems. The most important thing was that he was afraid that he would hurt people after waking up.Luo Shuyu was worried about Li Mingjin who had been poisoned. He heard Concubine Mei talked about life-saving measures, but he didn't know what it meant by life-saving measures: \"Does he have other diseases?\"The imperial doctor shook his head: \"No.\"Luo Shuyu asked again : \"Then why did he suddenly become irritable?\"The imperial doctor shook his head: \"Perhaps the weather is hot and everythings is hot, and people will become restless and hot. The little one added a fire-fighting medicine to His Highness's medicine.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Yes, imperial doctor.\" Is there a problem with the imperial doctor's medical skills, or is the poison in Li Mingjin can't get diagnosed and cured?The imperial doctor found nothing, which made Luo Shuyu very uneasy.After thinking about it, he asked the imperial doctor to wait in the mansion, fearing that Li Mingjin's condition would change at night.What kind of disease did Li Mingjin have? Was it a colorless, odorless poison? Couldn't even let the doctor see it?If this was the case, it was indeed the means to hide from The Emperor Tiansheng, and it was really the means to save his life. Li Mingjin's life in the palace in the past was more complicated than he imagined.Was this to defend against the Queen or against Concubine Lin, or something else?Several older princes were of the same age, and it was indeed easy to be targeted by them.Li Mingjin had taken medicine since he was a child, so that he would develop mania from time to time, in the eyes of others, he had lost his ability to compete for the throne, and The Emperor Tiansheng would definitely not consider a sick prince to inherit his country. For The Queen and Concubine Lin, there was also one less competitor, and the crown prince and the first prince didn't need to be wary of Li Mingjin everywhere.He had to say that this was a good way to kill multiple birds with one stone, and he didn't hesitate to damage his own body and survived in this world.But, who poisoned him? It could only be Concubine Mei or himself.The attack of the poison consumed most of Li Mingjin's energy, and he was unable to become irritable after waking up.Luo Shuyu was not afraid of this. Now in the mansion, the only people he could hurt were the people in the mansion only. Besides, the dark guard's martial arts level was not bad, and he could stop his behavior, so that he wouldn't continue to self-harm.The Emperor Tiansheng ordered Li Mingjin to be locked up, so his injuries could only be caused by self-harm, and no one should specifically hurt him.Luo Shuyu looked at Li Mingjin with pale lips lying on the bed, and felt distressed. He was still full of energy in the morning, and when he came back in the evening, he hurt himself all over. He didn't know how long it would take to keep him better.He really missed too much in his last life, and Li Mingjin fought for him for a few years of ease. Now that he thought about it, he really owed him a lot.He secretly sighed, and had Butler Sun be summoned, and ordered him to choose a few precious gifts to send to the families who were injured by Li Mingjin. No matter whether they had any malice towards Li Mingjin or not, he only needed to be polite. Li Mingjin's hurting people should all be spread now, and the Third Prince's Mansion couldn't justify it without a little bit of expression, and it was not a problem that could be solved with a little money.Butler Sun was a little surprised and said, \"I'll do it.\"In the past, there was no one else behind Li Mingjin, so it was only The Emperor Tiansheng or the Queen who sent them away at will, and no one paid attention to those who were hurt by Li Mingjin, but now he had Luo Shuyu, it must be done comprehensively, at least didn't let those people scolded their highness behind their backs every day.Luo Shuyu didn't know what the injured person who received the heavy gifts thought, but he definitely wouldn't tell people that the third prince was ignorant of etiquette and cruel.Li Mingjin didn't care about his reputation, but Luo Shuyu cared about his reputation and didn't want to hear anyone scolded him. This was a treasure he wanted to protect, and he would protect him all his life.Luo Shuyu called Ansan and asked him, \"What happened to His Highness before? You can tell me in detail, and you must not hide anything.\"Ansan: \"...\"Luo Shuyu said, \"I know that His Highness trusts you the most. Now His Highness is concealing his illness from me. I know the reason, and you don\u2019t have to think too much about it. Just say it. Does he hurts others more or hurts himself more, how many days will he get sick each time? Do you take any medicines that are not good for your health on weekdays?\"Luo Shuyu's question was very clear, and every sentence was on point.Ansan pondered for a long time, the third Imperial concubine asked deeply, he couldn't avoid it. Since His Royal Highness had already fallen ill, there was nothing to hide, so he said it one by one.Ansan: \"His Royal Highness will get sick once every three months, but the exact date can't be predicted. Every time he gets sick, His Highness may hurt others or self-harm when he is not self-conscious. Every time he gets sick, he asks us\u00a0 to tie him in the study to get through the dangerous period, and each time His Highness gets sick lasted for two days at a slower rate, or a day at a faster rate, and then he is no different from ordinary people.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Is there any medicine that hurts the body on weekdays?Ansan hesitated for a moment: \"...Yes.\"Luo Shuyu's face sank: \"Where is it?, take it to me.\"Ansan: \"The medicine is kept by His Highness himself, the subordinates don't know.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Oh, then I Find it myself.\"Ansan: \"...\" I didn't expect that the Third Prince's Imperial Concubine doesn't play the cards according to the routine at all.Luo Shuyu continued to ask: \"How many years has he been taking this medicine? What kind of medicine is it?, and is there an antidote?\"Ansan said, \"He already had this disease when this subordinate followed the third prince. As for the medicine, it's true, I don't know, and I don't know if there is an antidote. What this subordinate said is true, and I don't hide anything.\"Luo Shuyu said with a cold face, \"I know. Also, you don't know anything about your master's condition and didn't protect your master, this month's monthly salary will be halved, and you will receive the punishment yourself!\"Ansan: \"...Yes.\" His Highness had never deducted his salary, which was sad.But he also deserved it, and indeed he was also ineffective when protecting the Lord, and should be punished.Luo Shuyu added another sentence before he retreated: \"Remember, Ansan. His Highness' life is your life. If His Highness has three strengths and two weaknesses, you can't live.\"Ansan's heart trembled, and the third imperial concubine was more ruthless than His Royal Highness.Ansan convinced and said, \"It belongs to His Highness .\" However, he was a little enthusiastic and wanted to change his allegiance to the third imperial concubine.Luo Shuyu held the cold tea alone, thinking to himself: Li Mingjin lives, he lives, Li Mingjin dies, he won't live alone.At night, Li Mingjin developed a high fever. Luo Shuyu had previously let the imperial doctor wait in the mansion, and now it came in handy.Li Mingjin, who had already taken the medicine, had been sleeping soundly, but he didn't sleep very well, frowning between his brows and occasionally groaning.Luo Shuyu was close to his lips before he could hear what he murmured: \"Pain...\"He put his hand on Li Mingjin's face, it was very hot, it should be the pain caused by high fever.Luo Shuyu was both distressed and anxious: \"The imperial doctor, is there any way to reduce the fever of His Highness?The imperial doctor continued to take Li Mingjin's pulse and told Luo Shuyu not to worry, he would see how the situation was.How could Luo Shuyu not be in a hurry, if it wasn't for his old age, he almost wanted to go directly to the imperial hospital to find a few more imperial doctors for a consultation!After one round of diagnosis and treatment, the imperial doctor boiled the medicine again. Luo Shuyu asked Qingwang to decoct the medicine himself, and he couldn't pass it in the hands of anyone. If he neglected his duty, he would definitely be punished.Qing Wang didn't dare to be careless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Li Mingjin still consciously swallowed the decoction, but the medicine was bitter, and his mouth was full of dissatisfaction after drinking it. Luo Shuyu put a sugar in his mouth before falling asleep peacefully.However, Li Mingjin had new symptoms less than half an hour after he slept, and he began to feel cold all over his body, shouting cold in his mouth.Luo Shuyu also ordered two more quilts and covered him.The imperial doctor was confused by Li Mingjin's condition and wanted to give him acupuncture, but he saw that he was shaking so badly that he didn't dare to do it. Even if the third prince didn't inherit the throne in the future, he could still be the crowned king. The diagnosis and treatment must be satisfactory.Li Mingjin's condition repeated. After the high fever, he started to have a cold, and after the cold, he started to have high fever. Luo Shuyu stayed with him all night, and his condition stabilized in the morning. He didn't continue to have a high fever or cold.The imperial doctor was arranged to return to the guest room to rest.Luo Shuyu was also very tired, so he probed Li Mingjin's palm, no longer hot, and decided to lie on the table for a while.Chen Shi, Li Mingjin opened his sour eyes.[Chen Shi: dragon time 07.00-09.00]His mouth was full of bitter medicine, and his nose also smelled medicine. When he moved, his whole body hurt. He turned his head and saw Luo Shuyu, who was sleeping on the table.Li Mingjin opened his mouth, a little dry, and said hoarsely: \"Come here.\"Qingwang, who was standing by the side, immediately stepped forward and asked, \"Your Highness, are you awake?\"Luo Shuyu didn't sleep soundly. When Qingwang made a sound, he also woke up, turned his head and met Li Mingjin's eyes.Luo Shuyu asked him calmly, \"Wake up? Do you want to drink water?\"Probably due to his natural alertness, Li Mingjin felt that the calmness now, there might be a storm waiting for him, he didn't dare to say or ask more, only weakly, he made a single voice: \"Yeah.\"Luo Shuyu poured a glass of warm water, helped him up, and fed him the water: \"Do you still want it?\"Li Mingjin said, \"No.\"He remembered what he saw before he passed out. It was Luo Shuyu with a worried look on his face, but now, he was a little too calm.Don't ask anything?The more this happened, the more flustered Li Mingjin became.Luo Shuyu arranged for someone to prepare breakfast for Li Mingjin, and at the same time asked the imperial doctor to come over for another consultation.The imperial doctor said that he would continue to observe. As for now, the pulse was not as chaotic as last night, and he couldn't find any clue. Now it was much calmer.With his eyesight, the third imperial concubine directly detained him in the third prince's mansion last night, which showed that he had the courage to do things and was fearless. Similarly, he couldn't offend this person.Luo Shuyu didn't care what the imperial doctor was thinking about, he saw that Li Mingjin's eyes had returned to their former clearness, and he felt a lot more at ease. As soon as he relaxed, he started to feel sleepy.Li Mingjin was still a little weak and his lips were pale, but now he had neither fever nor chills, which was a good sign.He sat on the bed and had breakfast, while Luo Shuyu had it on the table.Luo Shuyu was too sleepy to speak, while Li Mingjin didn't know how to speak. He knew what his illness looked like, but he didn't know how much trouble he had last night.When he mustered up the courage to ask Luo Shuyu if he was tired last night and was frightened by him, Luo Shuyu fell asleep on the couch with the soft quilt.Li Mingjin didn't want to wake him up, so he continued to lie on the bed.Unconsciously, there was only peace in the room, and Li Mingjin could hear Luo Shuyu's slight breathing.This was the tranquility when the storm was about to come, and waiting was the most uncomfortable thing to do.The moment before, he promised Luo Shuyu that he wouldn't hurt his body again, but the next moment he came back full of injuries.His wife had never experienced this before, so he must had been terrified last night.Li Mingjin himself was also tired, so he fell asleep after thinking wildly. After waking up, he shouldn't be held accountable...When Luo Shuyu woke up, it was already the next day. The first time he went to see Li Mingjin, he found that the other party was sleeping soundly on the bed. He had no fever or chills, so he should be fine.The detained imperial doctor also got a good rest. At Luo Shuyu's request, he came over to give Li Mingjin a pulse, and then let him leave after confirming that there was no serious problem.At this time, Luo Shuyu was eating his late lunch outside, drinking the ginseng soup that Grandma Feng asked the kitchen to cook, and some porridge and side dishes.Only halfway through the meal, he saw Li Mingjin, and he woke up when he smelled the fragrant of chicken soup.Luo Shuyu helped him sit: \"Your Highness, does the wound hurt?\"Li Mingjin's stomach grumbled, \"The wound is okay.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Hungry?\"Li Mingjin nodded, \"Yes.\"Luo Shuyu Said: \"The imperial doctor said that you have to take medicine for the past two days, and you should have some porridge for the time being.\"Li Mingjin thought that what was served would be white porridge, but in fact Luo Shuyu told him with practical actions that he wouldn't make fun of his body.He chopped up the minced meat and put it in the thick porridge, and boiled it fragrantly. The dishes were also carefully cooked. It looked like a meat dish, but it actually tasted like vegetarian dishes.Li Mingjin's mouth was pale, but his appetite was okay, and he ate his share in a short time. It would be better if there were no injuries on his body. However, Luo Shuyu never asked him the origin of the scars on his body from beginning to end, and his heart became more and more uneasy.This is how to do?He must once again mustered the courage to take the initiative to confess.The afternoon sun was just right, and Luo Shuyu asked people to pull up the curtains. \"His Royal Highness is lying on the bed or on the couch?\"Li Mingjin said, \"On the couch, you can get some sunshine.\"Luo Shuyu helped him got on the couch, and then put a small table with tea and books on it. He sat on the other side, holding the book and started to read.Li Mingjin had a soft pillow behind his waist and held a book in his hand, but he couldn't read it at all: \"Yu'er, won't you talk to me?\"Luo Shuyu asked him without looking up, \"Your Highness. What do you want to talk about?\"Li Mingjin got stuck for a while: \"Well...I...\"Luo Shuyu: \"What's wrong with you?\"Li Mingjin: \"I was wrong.\"Luo Shuyu turned the page without looking up: \"What's wrong with Your Highness?\"Li Mingjin: \"I promised you not to make fun of my body.\"Luo Shuyu still didn't raise his head: \"Well, then what?\"Li Mingjin thought that his wife had suddenly become so indifferent: \"I didn't mean it.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Is that intentional? \"Li Mingjin immediately defended: \"Of course not!\"He suddenly touched the wound on his chest, \"Hey.\"Luo Shuyu put down the book: \"Where does Your Highness hurt?\"Li Mingjin covered his chest: \"Accidentally pulled the wound.\"Luo Shuyu couldn't continue to pretend to be indifferent: \"Don't move around, I'll see if there is any bleeding.\"When Luo Shuyu sat beside him, Li Mingjin looked at him and said, \"It shouldn't be.\"Luo Shuyu looked at his bandaged wound, and his eyes suddenly froze. It was red, and he hadn't shed a single tear since yesterday, but now looking at Li Mingjin, he still couldn't hold back.\"How can you scare me, you came back so easily, we are all alive, how can you scare me...\"Li Mingjin saw him cried so much that he also wanted to cry, so he hurriedly hugged him, wiping the tears on his face with his fingers.\"It's my fault, don't cry, you can beat me and scold me!\"Luo Shuyu rested his head on his shoulder, crying louder and louder, his whole body almost collapsed!When he cried, Li Mingjin's heart was almost broken, and now he regretted that he didn't greet his future wife with a healthy body.Li Mingjin patted him on the back and signed an unequal agreement in a hurry: \"Yu'er, as long as you don't cry, I can do anything!\"After crying for a while, Luo Shuyu asked him softly, \"Really?\"Li Mingjin nodded solemnly and continued to wipe his tears.Luo Shuyu sniffed \"Then give me the medicine.\"Li Mingjin: \"...\" How, how do you know?!The author has something to say:The Third Prince: Wife, I heard that the medicine in the novel next door will last longer, seven days at a time!Luo Shuyu: ...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He must have cheated him. After all, his wife was so smart.He pretended not to know what Luo Shuyu was talking about: \"What medicine did you say?\"Although Luo Shuyu looked pitiful and aggrieved now, if he really told him the truth of the matter, wouldn't it make him more worried, Li Mingjin felt that he couldn't do this.Luo Shuyu said with a flat mouth: \"How long does Your Highness want to hide from me? I don't know how you got sick, but you must take the drugs that harmful to your body for a long time, so don't try to lie to me, I confirmed it with mother concubine and Ansan.\"Li Mingjin almost tugged at the wound, his wife said the most ruthless words with an aggrieved expression, but he continued to feel that Luo Shuyu was lying to him.Li Mingjin continued to insist: \"What did they say?\" As long as he could survive Luo Shuyu's suspicion, it shouldn't be a big problem, and he would struggle.Although the tears in Luo Shuyu's eyes were not dry, his mind was very clear, and he asked one by one: \"His Royal Highness doesn't want to admit it, then no matter what they say, please explain to me why this time you hurt people for no reason, and why when you're sick you got chills and fever, even the imperial doctor can't diagnose and treat the real cause.\"Why did he hurt people?Li Mingjin didn't know how to explain this to Luo Shuyu.In fact, he felt unwell before he went out yesterday. After getting married, his life was so smooth that he almost forgot that he had unknown secrets. He thought he could survive this day, and then excused himself to stay outside for two days, and then returned home after his illness was over.He thought that his body would be in his control, but who knew, his thinking was too simple. During the attack, his temper would be extremely irritable. As long as he heard something unpleasant, he would attack directly and couldn't control his behavior.Yesterday at the school grounds, he was picking out the bows and arrows. The young men behind him were chatting and laughing. At first, he didn't notice what they were talking about until they mentioned the matter with Shen Mingyun and Li Mingchun.In the eyes of others, maybe this was just Li Mingchun's romantic affair, and it had nothing to do with Li Mingjin, but they said something that irritated Li Mingjin: \"What is so special about this ger of Luofu, so that the princes will linger on them.\"Li Mingjin heard this, his expression became more and more wrong. Li Mingchun stood far away and couldn't heard it. He got close, and listened to the conversation of these people word for word, and threw a hit towards the man who laughed the loudest.It was not enough to scold his wife, and he dared to say nonsense in front of him: \"Looking for death!\"The whip slapped them mercilessly, twice and three times!Several young people with broken mouths were shocked, some knelt down and begged for mercy, and some rolled and crawled to avoid Li Mingjin's whip.They never imagined that they would be heard by the third prince when they talked rude, and they remembered that what they said just now was completely disrespectful. These people knelt down and fled, but Li Mingjin's anger came up, in addition his mood became very irritable and restless, and he couldn't hold the whip, and several people were whipped around, and those who were present with unknown conditions couldn't stop him.Li Mingjin's martial arts were not bad, and soon the four of them saw blood!The movement on their side was so great that when The Emperor Tiansheng saw Li Mingjin beating people with a whip, he let the martial arts man removed his whip and tied him up. When he was subdued, Li Mingjin glared fiercely at the fallen man and several people, he tried his best to break free from the rope that bound him, like a mad and irritable lion.When he was taken away, Li Mingjin's consciousness was a little unclear, but he still said the sentence: \"Damn you!\"In this way, Li Mingjin was locked up. When he woke up, his body was covered with scars. He knew very well, all of these were self-inflicted injuries.Not long after he was cleared, he was released, and the guards helped him back to the mansion.When Luo Shuyu asked him about his \"medicine\", he didn't dare to say it, for fear that Luo Shuyu would be frightened, and that he would see himself did self-harming in the future.\"His Royal Highness?\" Luo Shuyu noticed Li Mingjin's hesitation and saw his hesitation on his face. If it was just an ordinary trivial matter, of course he wouldn't push it step by step, but it was about his life and their future. Couldn't let the condition worsen, \"I know you don't want to say it. It's fine if you don't say the cause of the disease, but I hope you don't hide anything about this disease from me.\"Li Mingjin looked at Luo Shuyu's eyes that immediately turned red again , he had to disarm and surrender, and sighed slightly: \"Don't cry, don't be angry, I said it. However, I want to know how mother concubine told you.\"Luo Shuyu told him about he went to the palace to find concubine Mei.Li Mingjin praised him: \"Yu'er is so smart, and he knows how to find mother concubine.\"Luo Shuyu glared at him: \"Of course, I'm dying, you still laugh.\"Li Mingjin: \"I didn't laugh.\"Luo Shuyu urged him: \"Then you hurry up and say it. You don't make it clear today, and I have to figure it out tomorrow, or I will go to the palace and ask mother concubine again.\"Li Mingjin pulled him and sat by his side. He had an injury on his back, so he couldn't make a big move. He could only hold Luo Shuyu's hand. Holding it like this, he seemed to comfort himself.Over the years, no one asked him about his illness. Everyone just thought he was a lunatic, a lunatic with a bad temper. Even the emperor thought so. In a sense, he was successfully survive.Li Mingjin said: \"This matter has to start when I was eight years old.\"Li Mingjin held his hand gently, Luo Shuyu felt that it was not tight enough, so he held back, fearing that he would pull his wound, and relaxed again. He was ready to listen to the past. He never knew about Li Mingjin in his last life, and now he couldn't wait to know all about his past.\"When I was young, I was quite smart among several princes. I was praised by my master several times for my homework, and gradually I was remembered by my father. I was relatively top-notch in both civil and military affairs. It was not until I had a tendency to surpass other princes, and the Changle Palace began to be counted, that mother concubine realized that I could no longer continue. I was still hesitant at first, but something happened when I was eight years old.\"\"That day, I was a little naughty and ran out to play without my mother concubine. I met my eldest brother and the second brother by the lake and asked them if they could play together, and they agreed. They said they wanted to hide and seek with me. I naively thought it was really a game between brothers. I listened to their suggestion and hid in a crevice by the lake. After waiting for a long time, no one came to me. I almost fell asleep. I was pushed down the lake by a shadow. If the mother concubine hadn't quietly ordered someone to teach me how to swim, I might be a corpse. \"\"I returned to Changle Palace wet, and mother concubine knew at a glance what was going on. She suppressed the matter and began to analyze the situation in the palace with me, as well as her identity. Three days later, mother concubine took out a prescription brought from Liang Guo, and asked someone to dispense the medicine and let me eat it. From then on, I would have seizures from time to time, and my temper would become extremely irritable and rough. Since then, no one secretly harmed me anymore, they all know that I'm useless. \"After Li Mingjin finished speaking, he looked at Luo Shuyu: \"It's probably like this.\"He understated the suffering he had suffered over the past ten years, and Luo Shuyu felt very sad, as long as he thought about it carefully, it was suffocating. In contrast, although he lived a normal life in Luofu in the past, he didn't have to worry about his life, and he didn't have to worry about being assassinated by others every day.However, it was still necessary to stop to the medicine itself, he didn't know about it before, so he didn't talk about it, and it must not continue now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is there an antidote.\"Li Mingjin shook his head: \"There is no antidote, even the medicine is three points poisonous.\"Luo Shuyu looked at him seriously: \"Your Highness, please stop.\"Li Mingjin was quite moved, and now his brutal image had long been imprinted in others' hearts, and he wouldn't be discovered by others even if he didn't continue to take the medicine.Li Mingjin: \"I won't take it again. I haven't touched it since we got married.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Will there be any consequences if you stop suddenly?\"Li Mingjin hesitated and said, \"This drug is addictive, if I don't take it maybe it will be a little uncomfortable, of course, it's also uncomfortable to take it.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Who did mother concubine get the recipe from?, can I ask the doctor to prescribe the antidote?\"Li Mingjin shook his head: \"I asked the doctor privately, and they all think there is no problem with the prescription, and it's a good medicine.\"Luo Shuyu: \"That's strange, why is this happening? Is your Highness's body different from ordinary people? Do you need to ask\u00a0 mother concubine the\u00a0 reason why you have been diagnosed and treated, but they haven't found\u00a0 out that you've ever taken that medicine, so it's strange. And the medicine\u00a0 has always been given to you by mother concubine?\"Li Mingjin nodded: \"Yes.\"Luo Shuyu understood that the source was still in Concubine Mei, but he still had a doubt: \"Why don't you put on a play on the surface and use\u00a0 medicine to maintain this image?\"Li Mingjin: \"Because I didn't like blood since I was a child, I didn't\u00a0 even dare to kill a chicken, but my mother concubine wants me to be violent\u00a0 in order to convince others, so if I don\u2019t take the medicine, I can\u2019t fool\u00a0 the eyes and ears of father, the queen and others by pretending to be crazy .\u201dThe medicine, no matter who came to check it, couldn't find out whether it\u00a0 was true or not. Even if someone found out that Li Mingjin had taken medicine, it could be said that other concubines in The Emperor Tiansheng's harem\u00a0 wanted to kill him. He knew nothing, and no one would think that\u00a0 Concubine Mei could make \"the tiger's poison eats the child\", she hated the\u00a0 act of feeding her own son with medicine.There was no better way for their mother and son.Concubine Mei was originally sent by Liang Guo to marry. It would be fine if the son she gave birth to was a mediocre one, but she gave birth to Li Mingjin too well. He had the talent of an emperor. He became mediocre, confirming to the outsiders the phrase \"small is good, big not necessarily good\".Luo Shuyu felt sorry for Li Mingjin after listening to these pasts. He had seen many articles written by Li Mingjin in his study, and every idea\u00a0 had his own unique insights, and it was more in line with the actual situation of their Daxia Kingdom.It was not unreasonable that he was more liked by the master than the first prince and the crown prince when he was a child.Luo Shuyu held his finger and said: \"I understand, the expert I met before also told me one thing, there is a doctor called 'Jiebaidu' in this world, if you can find him, there should be a cure for your disease.\" There is no antidote, only someone can cure it.\"I'll send someone to look for it, and I've made you worry again.\" Li Mingjin felt a little guilty towards Luo Shuyu.Luo Shuyu shook his head: \"As long as His Highness doesn't hide it from me, nothing will be a problem.\"The two had just talked for a while when Qingwang came in and told them that Mr. Chen asked to see him.Chen Rong?It was the staff member that Li Mingjin invited. What was he doing in the main courtyard at this time?The two looked at each other, Li Mingjin still decided to meet, Luo Shuyu helped him up and met him in the side hall.Luo Shuyu was still a little curious about Chen Rong.Li Mingjin's walking was not a big problem. Last time, the sprained foot was just right. This time, the injury was on the head and body. The medicine was used, and the wounds were painful, but if he could endure it for a while, if he didn't twist and move, he wouldn't feel so uncomfortable.Chen Rong first saluted: \"I have seen His Royal Highness and the third imperial concubine.\"Li Mingjin returned to his usual expressionless expression: \"No salute, sit down, sir, what's the matter?.\"Chen Rong: \"I heard that Your Highness was injured, so I came over to have a look. Is there something I can help?.\"When Li Mingjin saw him, he thought of the 'Jiebaidu' doctor Luo Shuyu just mentioned.Chen Rong had been in the mansion for more than a year, raising birds and painting every day. He lived better than his master, but his body was\u00a0 not very healthy.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin thought of it together, and they asked Chen Rong: \"I need master's help. You traveled abroad a few years ago, do you know a doctor named 'Jiebaidu'?\"Chen Rong was not from the capital, but he was very popular. Despite being in bad health, many friends had been made.\"Jie Baidu?\" Chen Rong guessed something at once, but he didn't ask the reason, and said, \"When I traveled in Liang Kingdom in previous years, I seem to have heard of this name.\"Li Mingjin said, \"We want to find him.\"Chen Rong: \"Then I will send a letter to a friend in Liang Guo, asking about the whereabouts of this person.\"Li Mingjin: \"In addition, there is no need to let the fourth person know about this matter.\" What he meant was not to let another aide Liang Jianxue Knew.Luo Shuyu asked Li Mingjin's attitude towards another aide. Maybe that Mr. Liang was stuffed in by someone else?After all, not everyone believed that Li Mingjin was really sick. Others were careful to make the Wannian Ship, so why were they not.Chen Rong came just in time for dinner, Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu kept him for dinner, and he was a little flattered.He had spent some time in the Third Prince's Mansion, but he had never had a meal with the Third Prince. He quietly observed the way the young couple got along.The two people revealed their intimacy unconsciously, and they should have\u00a0 good relationship, otherwise Li Mingjin wouldn't have mentioned \"Jie Baidu\" to Luo Shuyu in front of him.After dinner, Chen Rong went back to his yard.Luo Shuyu took out the quqin he had just taken out yesterday and played it to relieve Li Mingjin's boredom. If he hadn't been injured in his abdomen, he would have been able to play a tune.He was in the same bed tonight. As soon as Luo Shuyu lay down, Li\u00a0 Mingjin's hand drilled on him.Luo Shuyu held his restless hand: \"Your Highness!\"Li Mingjin said seriously, \"I'll touch it.\"Luo Shuyu: \"No!\" You are still injured!Li Mingjin: \"Okay.\"While Li Mingjin was recovering from his injury, Shen Mingyun lived up to the expectations and was carried into the Fourth Prince's Mansion. In his opinion, whether a concubine was not a wife was not important, and freedom was more important.After leaving Luofu, you could no longer be bound by Luo Renshou's benevolence, righteousness, etiquette, and you didn't have to prevent Luo Shumo from suddenly turning into a satyr and pressing him on the bed.He entered the Fourth Prince's Mansion with great joy. He didn't care about the so-called main and concubine rooms. He could still get a divorce after getting married in modern times. If he and the Fourth Prince didn't get along well, it wasn't that he couldn't leave.Now, the fourth prince was the person he liked, and the two also communicate with each other, and they agreed that they would be one person for the rest of their life.Only a few days after these words were finished, Zhou Guo's delegation brought Princess Zhou Guo to the capital ahead of schedule.At the same time, the system issued a new task to Shen Mingyun: please give the third prince Li Mingjin a chance to know Princess Zhou, and let him marry Princess Zhou as his equal wife.Shen Mingyun asked the system: \"Why does the mission involve the third prince again?\"The system said: \"Back to the host, the priority level of the mission isfive stars, please complete it as soon as possible.\"\"...\" Why is it useless?The author has something to say:The Third prince: wife,the distance between heaven and earth can be learned, I know your depth, you know my depth! We are a match made in heaven!Luo Shuyu:\u00a0 \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was only mid-October, and it was estimated that the winter would last for a long time.Luo Shuyu turned to Li Mingjin who was drinking hot tea and said, \"His Royal Highness, come and see, it's snowing.\"Seeing that he was wearing less clothes, stood at the window to blow air, Li Mingjin took a white fur coat and put it on him: \" Don't freeze.\"Stayed in the house for six or seven days, Li Mingjin was completely fine, the wounds were almost healed, but there were still ugly scars left.When he was young, he didn't leave many scars before, so Luo Shuyu didn't find it much before. Now when he was wiping his body, he could only see the shallow scars when he looked closely, but it was not obvious if he didn't look carefully.It took nearly seven days for Luo Shuyu to find out all the medicines that Li Mingjin had taken before. As for whether he threw it away or hid it, Li Mingjin didn't know. Didn't dare to reformulate new medicines behind Luo Shuyu's back.As soon as the man said a word, it was hard to chase after the horse, and if he said that he stopped taking it, he wouldn't take it again.The most important thing was that he was afraid that Luo Shuyu would cry in front of him. When he cried, he could do nothing. It was not a headache, but a heartache, the kind of pain that broke into pieces.\"It's not cold even when it's snowing.\" Luo Shuyu also reached out to touch the small ice strips by the window, it was cool, \"His Royal Highness, what do you think of when it's\u00a0 snowing?\"Li Mingjin wrapped Luo Shuyu in a fur coat and held him in his arms by the way. , the two heads next to each other.\"Snowball fight? I liked to play this with the little eunuch the most when I was young.\" Li Mingjin recalled his short childhood.Luo Shuyu recalled the last happy time of the two of them in their last life, and removed those unpleasant memories, and every other little thing was engraved in his mind. He remembered that at that time he was pregnant, and his stomach was very uncomfortable. He couldn't sleep well every night, and his temper became extremely bad.At that time, he knew that Li Mingjin was a little different to him. When he woke up in the winter, he saw a note on the dressing table with the words \"Yu'er, open the window.\"Luo Shuyu walked with a big belly, when he got to the window, he saw an ugly snowman with a carrot sticking on his head. It was gloomy for many days, but he finally laughed and was in a good mood. He ate an extra dumpling in the morning.In the last life, Li Mingjin was accommodating himself, so it was better to let him accommodate Li Mingjin in this life.Luo Shuyu's eyes lit up, and he turned to look at Li Mingjin: \"His Royal Highness, let's have snowball fight!\"Li Mingjin was confused by his eyes and couldn't help kissing him: \"Okay, let's have snowball fight.\"They were all young people, who didn't have playful heart, calm and steady, it was all for others to see. They didn't seem to care about this, and they could play like a child whatever they wanted. Even if they were known by The Tiansheng Emperor, it was not a big problem.At the moment when he threw the small snowball, Luo Shuyu realized the joy of playing in the snow. He had never played so happily as he was now.A snowball hit Li Mingjin's brim lightly, and Li Mingjin was stunned for a moment: \"You really hit me!\"Luo Shuyu smiled happily: \"Otherwise, it's snowball fight after all, Your Highness, be bold, this snowball fight was fun.\" It's just a little cold.Li Mingjin was really bold, and immediately formed a snowball and smashed it at Luo Shuyu's feet. He was reluctant to smash his own wife.Then he turned around and smashed towards the roof. Ansan, who was squatting on top to watch the excitement, was suddenly slapped by the oncoming snowball.Luo Shuyu said with a smile: \"Ansan, as an undercover guard, you are so unprepared that you can't even hide from your highness's snowball, so I will deduct your monthly salary!\"Ansan covered his heart: \"Your Highness, my monthly salary was about to be deducted by the third prince imperial concubine, I beg for mercy.\"Li Mingjin said without principle: \"What are you thinking?, in the entire palace, including me, under the control of the third prince imperial concubine.\"Ansan: \"...\" It's unprecedented for a husband to do something like you. No one do that!This morning, Luo Shuyu was in a very good mood.He didn't play for a long time outside. Li Mingjin was afraid that Luo Shuyu would catch a cold, so he took him back to the room, and he didn't even let him walk any longer. Luo Shuyu was only worried that his wound would open due to force.Li Mingjin: \"No, I'm almost healed. With your weight, you can't do anything to me.\"Luo Shuyu put his arms around his neck: \"His Royal Highness knows how to brag, I'll take off your clothes later, and I will verify it myself.\"Li Mingjin grunted and swallowed: \"It's not impossible, Yu'er takes it off for me, and I will treat each other with courtesy.\"Luo Shuyu, who didn't want to be \"treated with courtesy\" in the daytime, gave him white eyes: \"His Royal Highness, think about the small couch.\"Li Mingjin pursed his lips: \"...It's been several days.\" The words were full of resentment.Luo Shuyu couldn't help laughing.Back in the house, the two were intimate on the couch for a long time. If someone hadn't come looking for Li Mingjin, they would almost caught fire.It was Liang Jianxue and Chen Rong who came to see him. Liang Jianxue had a family in the capital, so he didn't live in the Third Prince's Mansion. Chen Rong lived in the side courtyard, which was a certain distance from the main courtyard. It was hard to be defensive.When he first entered the door, he took a deep breath and coughed for a while.Luo Shuyu felt uncomfortable for him when he heard it, and asked people to prepare two more braziers, so didn't freeze this unearthly creature.Liang Jianxue stayed away from Chen Rong a little bit, so as not to be sprayed with saliva by his cough, the meaning of disgust and arrogant were obvious. He also had some opinions on Luo Shuyu, who was sitting beside Li Mingjin. He thought that the third prince imperial concubine shouldn't be in the study, the ger and daughter should stay in the back house, but he didn't dare to say more, he listened to the servants in the mansion said that His Highness had a bad temper, even so the third prince Imperial concubine was extremely strict to him.Liang Jianxue: \"His Royal Highness, the Zhou envoy arrived on the outskirts of the capital yesterday, and will be staying at Honglu Temple today to wait for the Holy Master to receive them. I wonder if Your Highness has any ideas?\"Li Mingjin ate a chestnut that Luo Shuyu had peeled and said, \"What do you want?\"Liang Jianxue: \"I heard that the envoy of the State of Zhou brought their princess to have a kiss this time.\"Li Mingjin didn't lift his eyelids, crushed a chestnut, and peeled a good chestnut for Luo Shuyu: \"So what?\"Liang Jianxue began to talk about his plan incessantly. He said it and Li Mingjin's face darkened a bit. If it wasn't for his talent, Li Mingjin would directly let Ansan put his head in the snow to calm down.Chen Rong also peeled the chestnuts to eat, the chestnuts were fried with sugar.Liang Jianxue spoke more and more quietly, and in the end, only his voice became lower and lower and the sound of everyone peeling chestnuts were left in the room, and he felt guilty.\"His Royal Highness, my suggestion...\"Li Mingjin said with a sullen face: \"Do you have anything else to do?\"Liang Jianxue was swept away by his eyes, and his heart was empty and flustered: \"No, no more.\"\"Then without you, you go home first.\"Liang Jianxue: \"...\"Li Mingjin shouted: \"Where is Butler Sun? Send someone to take Mr. Liang out of the mansion.\"Liang Jianxue: \"...\"He didn't understand what was wrong with his suggestion!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you don't listen, forget it, why are you driving me out of the house?\"Luo Shuyu said with a smile, \"Mr. Liang, the weather is bad today, His Highness is worried that it will snow too much later and you can't go home.\"Whether it was because of His Highness that you couldn't go home or because it was snowing, only smart people would know.Whoever let him come up with this would be in trouble.What kind of ghost advice was mentioned just now, and he actually made Li Mingjin considered marrying Princess Zhou as his equal wife, and made Zhou Guo his future helper. Wasn't this blatantly telling The Emperor Tiansheng that he had thoughts about that position?Not to mention whether Li Mingjin needed help or not, just making this suggestion in front of Luo Shuyu was enough for Li Mingjin to beat him up.From now on, the Third Prince's Mansion should never see Liang Jianxue again. His words offended the two masters of the Third Prince's Mansion.Luo Shuyu felt that something was wrong: \"I'm afraid this Mr. Liang's suggestion is not his own.\"Li Mingjin asked Chen Rong, who was only thinking about eating chestnuts: \"Mr. Chen, do you have an idea?.\"Chen Rong smiled and shook his head: \"Go back to Your Highness, no. However, I agree with the third Imperial concubine's point of view. Liang Jianxue has a lot of money recently, maybe it has something to do with this.\"Li Mingjin said with a sullen face: \"Eat what's inside and outside.\"Luo Shuyu calmly said: \"Your Highness, don't be angry, this shows that Liang Jianxue is open to money. If someone really wants to make His Highness falls, he doesn't have much brains. How can someone who really do big things spend money to bribe your aides.\"Chen Rong looked at Luo Shuyu with interest: \" Is there a choice for the third imperial concubine?\"Luo Shuyu certainly had a choice in his heart, and he was so straightforward and didn't understand the clumsy way of doing things. He only thought of one person, and that was Shen Mingyun, whom he hadn't seen for a long time.Now Shen Mingyun had entered the Fourth Prince's Mansion, and the two were still in their honeymoon period.The composition of the Fourth Prince's Mansion was also very simple, but Shen Mingyun didn't enter as an imperial concubine, and he would still suffer some setbacks in the backyard.In front of Shen Mingyun, the fourth prince had always been a gentle and elegant image. Li Mingjin's house had received several women, and there were naturally many, not only women, but also gers. All of them were as beautiful as flowers. When Shen Mingyun first saw them, his face almost faded. One by one called him brother very cheerfully.Fortunately, the fourth prince and Shen Mingyun were in the honeymoon period, and the fourth prince still protecting him. Shen Mingyun was at peace with the fourth prince for the time being, but none of the people in the backyard were expelled and continued to stay in the mansion.The fourth prince said kindly: \"Send them away, and I don't know where they can go. It's better to send them out of the mansion after this winter. Mingyun, if you don't want to see them, let them live in a remote place.\"Shen Mingyun was all about doing his tasks, and he didn't have time to take care of these little things, so those Yingying Yanyan stayed behind.Shen Mingyun, who didn't know that he would cause trouble for himself, didn't directly find Liang Jianxue. He used the exchanged props to enlarge Liang Jianxue's greedy weakness, so Liang Jianxue suggested this to Li Mingjin.With such an abrupt proposal, Liang Jianxue was directly disgusted and abandoned by Li Mingjin, and he would no longer use this person or support him.At this time, Shen Mingyun didn't know that he had revealed his purpose early.Luo Shuyu didn't tell Chen Rong who bribed Liang Jianxue. He was guessing why Shen Mingyun wanted to send Princess Zhou to the Third Prince's Mansion.The mission must have been issued by system, and Shen Mingyun's mind wouldn't be able to imagine the delicate relationship between countries.Only why the system first issued the task of preventing him and Li Mingjin's wedding, and now wanted Li Mingjin to marry an equal wife? What was good would destroying his marriage with Li Mingjin do to the system?Because of his rebirth, the system changed Shen Mingyun's mission direction?In the book, the tasks of the system revolved around the big bosses that Shen Mingyun wanted to conquer. According to this point in time, Shen Mingyun should help Prince Zhou to get out of the predicament.Could it be that the existence of him and Li Mingjin would indirectly affect the future development of Shen Mingyun? Therefore, the system needed to use Shen Mingyun's hand to destroy their relationship, so as to achieve the goal of drifting apart.Why?He and Li Mingjin didn't play a big role in the book, and they couldn't even promote the relationship between Shen Mingyun and the fourth prince.Luo Shuyu listed his guesses one by one, affirming them first and then denying them. After thinking about it for a long time, he couldn't come up with a reason.Why did the system that had nothing to do with them in the last life asked Shen Mingyun to stumble them over and over again?was it because he and Li Mingjin would know how to prevent it in the future if they understood the reason?What would it be?He grabbed the end of the thread, but didn't pull out the thread that was hidden deep inside.On the third day of the arrival of the Zhou envoy, Li Mingjin attended the reception banquet that night according to The Emperor Tiansheng's request.The Emperor Tiansheng still wanted the fourth prince to marry the princess of Zhou.At the banquet, the crown prince, the first prince, and the fourth prince were all present.The veiled Princess Zhou happened to sit opposite the Fourth Prince.Li Mingjin drank casually with a glass of wine, the crown prince and the first prince sitting together still couldn't avoid a few words between you and me.Princess Zhou was beautiful, but both the crown prince and the first prince knew that this girl wouldn't fall into their house.After The Emperor Tiansheng appeared, the banquet was officially held.There was not enough of a brief contest between the two countries.Li Mingjin's injury was just healed, so he only sat on the sidelines and watched.But who knew if he should come or escaped, right after he and his wife went out, and he might not be able to stay out of it tonight.Someone mentioned him, and he was the envoy of the Zhou kingdom.Li Mingjin leaned crookedly on the edge of the table and asked the other party: \"What did you just say?\"The envoy of The Zhou State thought that he hadn't heard clearly and repeated: \"I heard that the third prince is a rare talent in Daxia Kingdom, ...\"Li Mingjin's face was as deep as water, and he looked at the messenger. The messenger felt that his back was straightened by his stare, and he swallowed the rest of the words.Li Mingjin nodded and acknowledged it: \"I'm good both civil and military, and my imperial concubine said the same.\"Everyone: \"...\"No, what did you say in the hall where the two countries met!The Emperor Tiansheng was amused by Li Mingjin's simplicity, but he understood what he meant. He had no intention of taking care of Princess Zhou.Zhou Guo's messenger was confused. Could it be that the person who sent him the information misled him?Princess Zhou looked at the third prince one more time, and was stared back by his calm eyes. She was so frightened that she usurped her fingers. Then she looked at the fourth prince with a gentle smile on her face. In comparison, it was extremely gentle.What happened at the banquet spread the next day.No one didn't know who Princess Zhou would end up with.Whether The Emperor Tiansheng would really send her and the Fourth Prince to Zuodui was uncertain.But one thing was certain, everyone in the capital knew that the fierce third prince was afraid of his husband, and he actually said in the hall that the third prince Imperial concubine praised him for his civil and military skills.No prince had spoken so frankly in front of others before.For a time, all the words related to husband control in the capital had the image of the protagonist!The next day, Luo Shuyu went to the First Prince's Mansion to attend the Snow Appreciation Banquet hosted by the First Prince's Imperial Concubine.He didn't come too early or late, so he shouldn't be too showy, and his clothes were relatively plain.But when he entered the door, everyone stared at him intentionally or unintentionally.As soon as he sat down, a woman asked him: \"The Third prince Imperial concubine, can I ask you for some advice on husband control?\"Luo Shuyu was stunned for a moment: \"...\" What kind of husband control?The author has something to say:The Third prince: Wife! you sit on it! Then shout \"Drive!\".Luo Shuyu: ...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were all the wives of the men who had frequent contacts on weekdays with the first prince. There were only a few of them who still maintained a neutral attitude and ddn't stand in line. The purpose was very clear, mainly because in order to consolidate and develop the supporters of the first prince.Naturally, the Crown Princess didn't attend today's plum appreciation banquet. She and the first prince's imperial concubine didn't go toe-to-toe with each other not for one or two days. If not for palace banquet, they would almost never meet, and they would almost never go to private banquets.Probably because the crown princess didn't like Luo Shuyu very much, she refused more decisively today, and she didn't come.Without the Crown Princess, Luo Shuyu became the focus of everyone, especially after it was rumored that he had a very powerful \"slavery technique\".Luo Shuyu was relatively low-key in his past life, and he didn't attend many such gatherings. Most of the time, he only went for important things before decided\u00a0 to go out, and he rarely showed his talents.At the plum-appreciating banquet at this time, because the word \"elegance\" was at the top of the list, naturally, the fun of writing poetry was indispensable. Luo Shuyu composed a poem on the theme of \"plum\".He didn't know if he was blessed with the title of the third prince's imperial concubine. Everyone was praising him, and he almost swelled up. Fortunately, he was very determined and hadn't been fascinated by the seemingly genuine praise, but it was also very headache. He always felt too eye-catching to be surrounded.During the second half of the plum banquet, Luo Shuyu gave all the opportunities to show up to other ladies. It was not good for him to stay in the First Prince's Mansion for too long, so as not to disturb the interest of others!Before leaving, the first prince's imperial concubine, Bi Ruoyao asked him quietly, \"Shuyu, do you know the concubine who the fourth brother took recently?\"Wasn't the fourth prince's concubine Shen Mingyun, how could he not know.On the bright side, the fourth prince followed the first prince, and the first prince would think that Shen Mingyun had taken refuge in the fourth prince's mansion, and the third prince and the Luo family would stand in the first prince's team.Luo Shuyu knew what she wanted to say, so he avoided the slightest and said: \"I heard from my father that the fourth prince fell in love with cousin Shen at first sight , and he entered the mansion because he admired him. The family didn't interfere.\"Bi Ruoyao smiled softly: \"I have no other intentions, I just heard that your cousin has a talent for business.\"Luo Shuyu said: \"It's all small business that can't be seen, the first prince's imperial concubine don't need to care too much.\"Bi Ruoyao knew Shen Mingyun, now that he had entered the fourth prince's mansion, she naturally felt that she could use him for herself. She greeted Luo Shuyu mainly because she wanted to win over the third prince and test his meaning.Luo Shuyu wisely weakened Shen Mingyun's ability. When he said this, the first prince's imperial concubine would consider it more. Whether to listen to or not, it was up to her to judge.Bi Ruoyao couldn't get more evaluation of Shen Mingyun from Luo Shuyu, so she stopped keeping him.Just after Luo Shuyu left, she was unwilling and say to the people around her: \"This Luo Shuyu is simply toasting and not eating and drinking. I entertained him today deliciously, but he didn't even eat the oil and salt. It's really a family with the third prince.\"The maid: \"Master, don't worry, the third prince hasn't stood in line for so many years, which is also a good thing for us, and the third prince's imperial concubine dare not jump out, you can coax him to come up with another blueprint or help His Highness.\"Bi Ruoyao pulled out the bead hairpin on her head and said, \"Also, won't there be cuju on ice in a few days? Everyone will go and let the fourth brother bring Shen Mingyun, and when the time comes to see what Luo Shuyu's face is like, I don't believe that we can't pull him onto our family's boat.\"[cuju: ancient Chinese football (soccer)]The maid: \"But, will this be counterproductive?\"Bi Ruoyao: \"It doesn't matter, what does it have to do with us when the fourth prince takes Shen Mingyun out? Cuju on ice is also held in the name of the father emperor.\"Everyone had fun, and this was also another occasion for monarchs and ministers to communicate.The maid: \"Master, have you forgotten? Princess Zhou may also participate, and His Majesty hasn't yet determined who to point her to.\"Bi Ruoyao: \"Oh, this is interesting, his Highness told me that Princess Zhou intends to have The third prince, he also said that he is good both civil and military.\"The maid: \"Yes, it's a pity that His Royal Highness the third prince only sees the third prince's imperial concubine.\"Bi Ruoyao: \"This Luo Shuyu is indeed not simple, let's see who the princess of the Zhou Kingdom will be on the day of Cuju.\"When Luo Shuyu just returned to the mansion, Li Mingjin came back.The two of them changed from their snow-stained clothes one after the other.Luo Shuyu sat on the couch, holding the hand furnace that Qingwang handed to him, and said to Li Mingjin: \"Your Highness, will you be able to play Cuju on ice in three days?\"Li Mingjin took off his leather boots and returned to Luo Shuyu: \"Of course, today Lin Haiming teamed up with me to practice and cooperated.\"After changing to dry clothes, Li Mingjin sat opposite Luo Shuyu and drank the hot tea he poured.Luo Shuyu was worried about his body: \"Is the injury on the body okay?\"Li Mingjin raised his hands: \"Look, it's already healed, it's not in the way.\"Luo Shuyu was still a little worried: \"At that time, you have to fight against people, and the ice is still so slippery. I'm afraid you will get hurt.\"Since their marriage, Li Mingjin had always been injured, and Luo Shuyu really had to worry.Li Mingjin reassured him: \"You have to believe that my martial arts are not that bad.\"\"I believe in you, but I don't believe in others.\" Luo Shuyu took advantage of the opportunity to mention today's plum banquet, \"Today, the first prince's imperial concubine is still testing my attitude.\"Li Mingjin asked, \"How do you get back to her?\"Luo Shuyu said, \"Of course I follow His Highness, but she mainly mentioned Shen Mingyun. She must have known that the blueprint last time was provided by Shen Mingyun, to test whether Shen Mingyun and I are in the same group.\"Li Mingjin: \"It's really troublesome, Shen Mingyun entered the fourth brother's house, although the father emperor didn't say anything, but the others are not sure.\"Luo Shuyu: \"I think so too, I guess the fourth prince will take him to see Cuju. \"It was written in the book that Shen Mingyun went to visit cuju on ice competition of the royal family in the winter, and he went with The Fourth Prince at that time.Originally, he had no chance to go when Liu Shi was not there. However, he went to the Fourth Prince's Mansion. The Fourth Prince currently had no concubine, so it was not a big problem to bring someone.This time it was only a royal entertainment program, not a place to receive foreign guests. The Emperor Tiansheng would also bring a few concubines to watch it.Li Mingjin asked Luo Shuyu carefully: \"Then do you like to watch Cuju?\"Luo Shuyu saw the eagerness and uncertainty in his eyes, and smiled slightly: \"I like it.\"Cuju, he would also follow, but he didn't see anything during the whole process. He always felt that he was out of place. In the next few years in the past life, he didn't see Li Mingjin participate in the Cuju competition.Probably because of a different mood, Luo Shuyu now was looking forward to see Li Mingjin's high-spirited and wanton appearance on the ice rink.It would take a long time to go back and forth, and it was almost evening after returning from the First Prince\u2019s Mansion today.In the winter, the sky was getting dark soon, Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin sat in the room for a while and then turned on the light.For dinner, there was Li Mingjin's favorite meat, and Luo Shuyu's favorite clear soup.After dinner, Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu played chess together on the couch, and then turned into Gobang.Li Mingjin would also play tricks with Luo Shuyu.Li Mingjin: \"Wait, I'm not going to take this step.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Your Highness is shameless, and you will regret it.\"Li Mingjin: \"No.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Then put the pieces in your hand back.\"Li Mingjin: \"Don't, let me think again, it must be this step.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Okay, let you go.\"Li Mingjin: \"Why you eat it again!\"Luo Shuyu: \"...Your Highness is probably not suitable for playing chess.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since he got used to Li Mingjin, he could accept these things very well most of the time, and even enjoyed it. He thought that he may really like Li Mingjin more and more and could accept all of his everything.The small couch was not very comfortable, and the clothes were not completely undone. After a round of trying, Li Mingjin carried Luo Shuyu back to the bed, and then started a new round of tumbling.It wasn't until late at night that he let go Luo Shuyu. He thought wearily: Isn't it tiring to practice Cuju? Why are you so energetic at night? His Highness must be lazy!three days later.Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu went to the place for cuju.They came late, only a little earlier than The Emperor Tiansheng, which was in line with the style of the third prince.Even if The Emperor Tiansheng knew, he wouldn't say anything. The third son was so casual in front of him, just get used to it.All of his sons were quite well-behaved in front of him, and Li Mingjin's jumping off made him realized the feeling of being a father, not a courtier, but a father and son. Therefore, in these years, Li Mingjin had a bad reputation, but he still lived very well, thanks to the little \"father-son relationship\" that The Emperor Tiansheng only had.It was sunny today, but the temperature was still low.The carriages were parked all over the place.Li Mingjin put a hat from fox fur on Luo Shuyu and wrapped him in a mink fur coat. After getting off the carriage, he was supported by Li Mingjin and walked forward to prevent his feet from slipping. The two listened to the sound of their feet stepping on the snow. The sound entered the sheltered shed.Luo Shuyu pushed the brim of his hat: \"Your Highness, I feel like a snowball now, can I take off my hat?\"Li Mingjin said with a stern face: \"No, you coughed a little yesterday, so you can't get sick.\"Luo Shuyu gently pinched him: \"Who is the culprit? Who doesn't sleep in the middle of the night and doesn't let me sleep?.\"Li Mingjin knew that he was wrong, so he pretended to be pinched and said, \"I was wrong. Well, next time I will make you go to bed earlier, it hurts.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Come on, I didn't pinch you.\"Li Mingjin: \"...\" wife always made him uncomfortable.The two came late, and when they took their seats, they were greeted by everyone's attention.Luo Shuyu's fur coat was not the most gorgeous, but it was the most elegant and beautiful in the audience, and the brightest was the red coat of the crown princess.Luo Shuyu glanced around and saw Shen Mingyun sat beside the fourth prince Li Mingchun. He was also wearing a fur coat of the same color as the crown princess, and the two clashed.Today's Shen Mingyun was not the same as in Luofu. Luo Shuyu could see the joy on his face and he was very interested in Cuju on ice, as if he was the one who would play soon, the fourth prince would say two or more sentences. The two were talking and laughing, and they seemed to be quite affectionate, but he was sitting behind Li Mingchun, instead of the Imperial concubine's position beside him, and everyone knew at a glance what his identity.All the dignitaries were present, and Shen Mingyun was really nothing.After Luo Shuyu finished paying attention to Shen Mingyun, he felt a line of sight falling on him. He turned his head and saw a dignified woman sitting not far away. The other party looked beautiful and looked at Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin.Luo Shuyu asked Li Mingjin: \"Your Highness, is that Princess Zhou?\"He had seen most of the ladies present, but not the woman in the dark fur coat, and he could guess who she was.Judging rationally, this woman still had a bit of heroic spirit. Although her appearance was exquisite, he always felt that something was wrong. Her temperament was not like the small jade of the woman raised in the boudoir of Daxia Kingdom.Li Mingjin nodded cautiously: \"Well, I swear I have absolutely no thoughts about her!\"Luo Shuyu wondered where he was going, was he such a petty person?Luo Shuyu said: \"I believe in Your Highness.\"Li Mingjin was satisfied: \"I'll show you the goal later.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Okay.\" When he turned his head again, Princess Zhou had already turned his attention to other places.He had a doubt now, why he never heard that Princess Zhou went to Daxia to marry in his last life?What about the Zhou Kingdom's prince who hooked up with Shen Mingyun?Looking at the love between Shen Mingyun and the fourth prince, it didn't seem like they knew another man.However, he (SMY) had always been this heartless and ignorant, and his joys and sorrows were all written on his face.The Emperor Tiansheng arrived on time with a group of concubines. Because the queen had a cold, the one who sat with The Emperor Tiansheng today was Concubine Lin Gui, and the others were next to them.The teams were all free combinations, with a total of eight teams competing for the top spot today.Among the eight teams, four adult princes each lead a team, and each round of competition was two quarters of an hour.Daxia's requirements for men were both civil and military, even if they were civil officials, their force value was not low.In the first round, there were two teams, one of which was led by the crown prince. Not surprisingly, the team with the crown prince won.The team that appeared in the second round was led by the Fourth Prince, but this time, the Fourth Prince's team lost. He humbly and politely encouraged the other team to win!Luo Shuyu felt that the fourth prince would be able to capture people's hearts, and the officials who won his team smiled at the fourth prince.Only Shen Mingyun looked regretful when he saw the fourth prince coming back, and then gave the fourth prince a call, pointing out where he made mistakes, etc. He didn't see that the fourth prince intended to let the opponent win the game, the more he listened to Shen Mingyun, his face darkened as he spoke.Li Mingchun wondered if Shen Mingyun didn't know much about to save his face.The third round was the military commander team, which was even more interesting. Compared with the delicate team, the military commander team played extremely well. You scored a goal, and we immediately hit back. The scores alternated up and down, which made people very worried. In the end, it was decided that the Tigers Down the Mountain Team won.In the fourth round, the team led by Li Mingjin faced another team of generals. He played with his friend Lin Haiming.Luo Shuyu was a little nervous sitting in the stands, so he stood up holding the hand stove and watched Li Mingjin's game nervously.When his actions were seen by Concubine Lin Gui, she joked with The Emperor Tiansheng: \"The third prince's imperial concubine is a little worried about the third prince.\"The Emperor Tiansheng was a little different to Li Mingjin, and replied with a smile: \"The young couple is newly married, and they are intimate, affectionate and caring.\"Now who didn't know that the third child was a strict husband, and the feeling was good, the third prince's imperial concubine was sincere towards the third child, worrying about him was not a big\u00a0 deal, and he seemed affectionate and caring.Concubine Lin wanted to give eye drop, but it didn't work, so she had to laugh with him, thinking that the first prince's imperial concubine was not as good as the third new daughter-in-law.Luo Shuyu didn't know that one of his actions had become the object of comparison.Li Mingjin saw Luo Shuyu, who stood up to watch his game, played a heroic role in this match, made three goals in a row!After winning, he directly waved at Luo Shuyu and made a victory gesture, successfully amusing The Emperor Tiansheng.After Li Mingjin returned to his seat after the competition, Luo Shuyu immediately asked Li Mingjin to put on his fur coat so that he wouldn't freeze.Li Mingjin proudly asked Luo Shuyu: \"Am I very good?.\"Luo Shuyu didn't hesitate to praise him: \"His Royal Highness is the best in the game, I counted the five goals you scored, it's really good. In exchange the other team can't make a goal.\"Li Mingjin was praised by Luo Shuyu and he was very comfortable and full of joy.Next was the second round of competition. The crown prince's team would face the first prince's team, which was very interesting.Before the game started, Luo Shuyu drank a little too much tea because he was nervous, afraid that Li Mingjin would be injured, so he took the opportunity to visit Gongfang.[Gongfang: \u606d\u623f, toilet]Li Mingjin's eyes brightened and wanted to accompany him, but Luo Shuyu refused righteously and sternly. It was just Gongfang. Do you want to do anything else?Luo Shuyu went to Gongfang, and unexpectedly met Shen Mingyun, who just came out, and the tall and heroic Princess Zhou.He found that at this time, Princess Zhou's face was flushed, and there was still a bit of embarrassment on her face.The author has something to say:The third Prince: Wife, I want to have an exciting ice cart exercise with you!Luo Shuyu: ...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In his eyes, Luo Shuyu was a young man with red lips and white teeth. Compared with other Daxia gers he had come into contact with, this third prince's imperial concubine was very elegant in dress and had a cold voice. He was different, and he was also different from Shen Mingyun who just helped him to show the \"correct\" Gongfang.A snow lotus in the Tianshan Mountains was like an unworldly one, and a wild chrysanthemum blooming under the scorching sun.Princess Jiayang took a deep breath: \"I'm fine.\"Standing with Princess Jiayang, Luo Shuyu realized that she was half a head taller than himself, and he was too thin to show her figure. As a woman, her figure was too mediocre and had no curvature at all.Luo Shuyu said to her: \"It's cold outside, the princess should go back to the shed as soon as possible, to be warmer.\"Shen Mingyun, who had always been the protagonist, was not happy . He felt that he was completely ignored: \"Wait a minute.\"Luo Shuyu seemed only to see him just now, frowning unhappily, interjecting was the most impolite behavior.Princess Jiayang thought that the two of them didn't know each other, so she spoke out to help Shen Mingyun: \"Just now, this gongzi did me a favor, and the third prince's imperial concubine please don't blame him.\" Princess Jiayang was very clear about this.According to Shen Mingyun's dress, it could be seen that he was a ger, the ger's and the woman's Gongfang were separated, and the chance of the two meeting was not high.Luo Shuyu didn't mean to care about Shen Mingyun at all. He was thinking of something else. He guessed whether Shen Mingyun received the task of helping Princess Jiayang, so he appeared here.What kind of task made a person blush?Shen Mingyun molested a woman as a ger? Not too possible.Although Shen Mingyun was not in a tune, he was always a \"gentleman\" outside. This word was also what Luo Shuyu saw in the book. After all, how to tolerant to women, it was also a matter of his face.Shen Mingyun waved his hand very vigorously: \"Princess Jiayang, don't be polite, it's not your fault that you went to the wrong Gongfang, just don't find it wrong next time, I'll go back to the shed with you, it's freezing outside. \"No need to guess, this was Shen Mingyun's task, to guide Princess Jiayang to find the correct Gongfang, it was better not to say this to Princess Jiayang.Luo Shuyu was speechless at Shen Mingyun's vulgarity, and he bluntly told the story of a woman entering the wrong Gongfang, which was simply amazing. The other party was still a princess of a country. He didn't know how many people would laugh at her in the future. He hoped Shen Mingyun wouldn't be too loud to publicize this matter, which was not very good for the woman's reputation.At this time, Luo Shuyu didn't really want to talk to Shen Mingyun: \"Then Princess Jiayang, be careful on the road, the ground is full of snow and slippery.\"Princess Jiayang said politely: \"Thank you for your concern.\"Shen Mingyun didn't want to confront Luo Shuyu, and strongly demanded to go with Princess Jiayang, the latter didn't express his unwillingness to go with him since the other party had helped him.Luo Shuyu didn't stop Shen Mingyun from leaving, and looked at the backs of them leaving thoughtfully.When he returned to the shed, Luo Shuyu asked Li Mingjin in a low voice: \"Your Highness, what kind of woman do you think will be open-minded? Gongfang is so obvious, as long as she is not blind, she should be able to tell the difference.\"Li Mingjin immediately expressed his loyalty, completely misinterpreting his meaning: \"Even if women are flat, I don't like them!\"Luo Shuyu reluctantly explained: \"Your Highness, be serious.\"Li Mingjin returned to normal: \"Yu'er means Princess Zhou?\"Luo Shuyu narrowed his eyes: \"You just said that you don't like flat-chested women, how do you know that I talked about Princess Jiayang?.\"It was really hard to get rid of it even after jumping into the Yellow River. Li Mingjin thought to himself that it was really hard to guess what this gongzi was thinking. He just told him to be serious, but when he was serious, he began to question him again.Li Mingjin tried his best to say straightly: \"I heard Lin Haiming mention it just now, that guy likes that kind of woman with a back in front of her chest. I really didn't stare at others!\"Luo Shuyu smiled: \"I believe you.\"Li Mingjin: \"Then why are you asking this?\"Luo Shuyu: \"I see that she is quite abnormal, she is not so thin that she has no flesh at all. She had a little oolong just now and her face was rosy, indicating that she is in good health, but it's strange, Is he alright?\"Li Mingjin stared at Luo Shuyu's chest: \"I also think why is gongzi like this.\"Luo Shuyu noticed that his eyes had changed, and said coldly, \"Your Highness, outside.\"Li Mingjin swallowed, looked away, and said with a sullen face. \"Yu'er, can you let me eat at night?\"Luo Shuyu bit his lip and stared at him with a slightly hot face: \"Your Highness!\"Li Mingjin sat up straight and coughed lightly, \"This Cuju is really boring, it's better to sleep in the house.\"Luo Shuyu knew that his sleep was wrong: \"If you say it again, I will ignore you.\"Li Mingjin felt regretful: \"Well, let's continue with the question we just said.\"\"Do you still remember my question?\" Luo Shuyu glanced at him, and it all went a thousand miles away.Li Mingjin just wanted to tease his serious wife, and he was in a good mood when he saw his blushing face.But when the wife was angry, he had to coax him: \"I have a good memory, remember, remember.\"Luo Shuyu asked him: \"Then tell me, what is the reason?\"Li Mingjin thought for a while, and said, \"It's not sick , that's another reason.\"Luo Shuyu added: \"Are all women in Zhou Guo very tall? I'm taller among the gers, she's half a head taller than me, maybe even taller, It's almost as tall as you.\"Thinking that in the book, Luo Shuyu didn't even see Princess Zhou appearing, whether because of what Shen Mingyun did in his previous life, he directly squeezed out Princess Jiaming's appearance, she had no chance to appear in front of others, maybe she died on the way.Li Mingjin's mind flashed: \"What do you mean?\"Luo Shuyu looked at him: \"Yeah.\"The two approached again after talking, and Li Mingjin lowered his voice: \"you suspect that he may be a ger or a man.\"If he hadn't entered the man's gongfang habitually, he wouldn't have gone wrong, and when Shen Mingyun found out, Princess Jiayang wouldn't be flushed red because of being caught.Luo Shuyu: \"This is just my guess.\"Li Mingjin stared at him thinking, very cute, and wanted to kiss him, who said that a serious man was the most handsome, and his wife was also very handsome, and wanted to\u00a0 do shameful thing with him.Whether it was outside, Li Mingjin still tried his best to suppress his desires, and turned to think about Luo Shuyu's speculation, which must be carefully considered.Li Mingjin: \"I sent people to watch at night. Zhou Guo sent a man who pretended to be a woman to come and have a marriage. When the father emperor knew about it, he would definitely use it to raise the troops. Now I see that the country is prosperous and the people were strong, but the harvest hasn't been very good in the past two years. Or there is some ulterior secret here.\"Luo Shuyu nodded: \"Do you want to check it quietly?\"Seeing the eunuch coming over, Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin stopped chatting, and there was no need to say anything else, they both knew very well.No matter how rich the country was and the people were strong, it couldn\u2019t stand the consumption of infighting and war, let alone natural disasters, which were problems that need to be solved urgently.The game on the ice rink continued.The Emperor Tiansheng was very happy to see it, and everyone was also happy.The Cuju on ice competition was originally an opportunity for those with high military values to show off. Li Mingjin's team rushed to the end and pushed the crown Prince's team to the second place. After all, Li Mingjin didn't compete with him for the throne, so he quickly accepted that he lost. In reality, his force was indeed inferior to that of the third brother.The Emperor Tiansheng gave Li Mingjin's team a bunch of things, and The Emperor Tiansheng also gave Li Mingjin a very thick fur coat.Li Mingjin was extremely satisfied, the things that The Emperor Tiansheng gave were not bad, and a thick fur coat could be used as a quilt in winter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone was eating barbecue in the shed, and they could play ice skating here in the afternoon.Li Mingjin personally went to the shelf to roast mutton for Luo Shuyu. It was oily and fragrant, and it was delicious with some seasoning.Li Mingjin said to Luo Shuyu: \"If you feel greasy, eat less.\"Luo Shuyu shook his head: \"Your Highness, I have been eating meat with you all this time, and I am not afraid of being greasy.\"Li Mingjin: \"Then two more? \"Luo Shuyu: \"Okay, add some chili powder for me.\"Li Mingjin: \"How come the taste\u00a0 become heavier?\"Luo Shuyu: \"It's cold, eat something spicy and warm.\"Li Mingjin himself liked it, so he wouldn't talk about him. The two were eating when they suddenly heard the sound from the ice rink! The strange things you didn't know yet.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin looked at the ice rink together.They saw a red figure sliding on the ice rink. The gestures and movements were extremely beautiful, the sliding speed was extremely fast, and every movement was very elegant, like a colorful butterfly dancing on the ice.Luo Shuyu knew who it was just by looking at it.Li Mingjin commented pertinently: \"Although your cousin is useless, this skating is good.\"Luo Shuyu was not surprised, Shen Mingyun must have exchanged the \"Prince on Ice\" card from the system for a quarter of an hour, he raised his eyebrows, chuckled: \"Your Highness, believe it or not, he will come down in a quarter of an hour, and he will not go up to skate again.\"He remembered the content of Cuju on Ice in the book, the points redeemed for this \"Prince on Ice\" card were not low, there was only one in the system.Shen Mingyun grew up in a city where there was not much snow. He couldn't skate at all, and he couldn't do the most basic skating. Now that he was so prominent, it was also because he wanted to get more attention and get to know more people, so he would have more advanced tasks, and staying in the back house would really affect his performance.Li Mingjin said with emotion: \"He's really weird.\"Luo Shuyu nodded: \"Well, it's weird.\"Li Mingjin took a big bite of meat: \"Weird things happen every year, especially this year.\"Everyone's attention was attracted by Shen Mingyun, but Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin were eating barbecued meat calmly like no one else.A quarter of an hour later, Shen Mingyun really returned to the fourth prince's side, his face flushed red, and the fourth prince put on a fur coat on him very lovingly.Although Shen Mingyun's skills on ice were the best, there was not a single person who wanted to come over to ask him about his skills on ice, because his identity was a very real issue, and no matter how powerful he was, he was only a concubine.An unmarried ger or woman would never ask a concubine for advice, and even Luo Shuyao and Luo Shuyue brought by Luo Shangshu wished to stay away from him. Everyone who had a bit of etiquette knew that they would rather marry a lowly than became a concubine, but Shen Mingyun had sex with people before marriage, and had private meetings with people in the middle of the night. He had no sense of shame. He became a typical negative teaching material in the Luo family. The old lady who loved him the most was so angry that he was carried into the Fourth Prince's Mansion for several days.Shen Mingyun didn't achieve the goal he wanted, and it was extremely painful. He was so outstanding, and he still couldn't receive compliment? Were these people blind?As for the fourth prince, he didn't care about Shen Mingyun showing off his ice skills on the ice. He knew that Shen Mingyun was very special, and the better and the more special he was, the more proof that his original idea was right.Just as the fourth prince, Li Mingchun, was thinking, Concubine Lin sent someone to pass a message. He didn't see enough of the dance on ice just now. Asking him if he could let Shen Mingyun go for another round, and enjoying the beauty while eating was also a great pleasure today.Li Mingchun only thought that Shen Mingyun was extremely powerful, and said to him: \"Concubine Lin sent someone to ask you to go up and skate for another quarter of an hour, is it possible?\"Shen Mingyun shook his head decisively: \"That's not possible, I'm very tired from skating just now, and now I have a little strength. No more, can't get on.\"Li Mingchun frowned slightly, and he said a little displeased: \"Mingyun, now you and I are one, and you know my current situation. Didn't you say that we should understand each other? Concubine Lin has treated me well these years, if I can\u2019t meet the requirements, she will definitely attack me in the future, she is a more careful person.\u201dShen Mingyun raised his teacup, as if it had nothing to do with himself: \u201cThat\u2019s really impossible, I can\u2019t do it, and now my whole body is collapsed.\" He could only sit on the chair like a rogue, and fell straight down, not dignified at all.Although Li Mingchun was angry, he couldn't force him if he didn't want to go. He could only go to Concubine Lin to refuse. When he came back, the smile on his face was a little lighter. Shen Mingyun talked to him, and he ignore him.Compared with the husband and wife of Luo Shuyu who were eating happily next door, there was a world of difference.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin also found out that Concubine Lin wanted Shen Mingyun to go up and perform for a while, but she was rejected, so the fourth prince went to apologize in person.Luo Shuyu said: \"Look, I said he won't go up again.\"Li Mingjin: \"Fourth brother really lost his face this time. He has always been the most concerned about image.\"Not much to say.After eating and drinking, Li Mingjin asked Luo Shuyu if he wanted to go down and play for a while.Luo Shuyu looked at Li Mingjin's eyes very brightly: \"Then let's go.\"Speaking of skating, Li Mingjin was a master, Luo Shuyu had never touched it, and he seldom played in the snow, otherwise on the day it just snowed, he wouldn't be more enjoyable than Li Mingjin, after all, there were still some children's hearts in it.Luo Shuyu was the first imperial concubine to go skating, and he was led by Li Mingjin, which quickly attracted everyone' s attention.they heard that the third prince was afraid of his wife, now it seemed that it was not a rumor either.Seeing that the third prince carefully helped Luo Shuyu on the ice rink, he was simply a model of a good husband.For a time, the wives beside the officials and the Imperial concubines were all sore, and they clearly hinted at their husbands.An old middle-aged woman: \"Master, look at the third prince, he is very affectionate to the third prince's imperial concubine.\"The young wife who had been married for more than two years: \"Husband, would you take me to the ice rink to teach me how to skate? \"The newlywed wife who was a bit arrogant and spoiled: \"Official, I want to skate too!\"Even Concubine Lin showed an envious look: \"Your Majesty is right, the husband and wife of the third prince are really loving, and they liked to play when they were young.\"The Emperor Tiansheng laughed: \"I know, I know, if you like it, you'll also go for a ride with me.\"Concubine Lin said in a coquettish tone, \"Come on, it's all young people's world, so let's give others a chance.\"Shen Mingyun on the side was so angry that his face turned green, why Luo Shuyu could attract everyone's attention, and a group of people talked to him intentionally or unintentionally, but he was only suppressed by the imperial power of Concubine Lin.Thinking of his unfinished tasks, he looked at Princess Jiayang sitting in the shed.It was a wonderful task to get Li Mingjin and Princess Jiayang to fight against each other.Who made Luo Shuyu opposed him everywhere!While everyone was having a good time, there was a movement from the crown Prince's side. He heard that the crown princess suddenly passed out in the shed. Now the crown Prince was very nervous and had already sent someone to invite the accompanying imperial doctor!Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu were not interested in playing either. The two returned to the shed, and the others stopped playing.The crown princess fainted, who would dare to continue playing without heart.However, good news soon came. According to the diagnosis of the imperial doctor who was waiting at the scene, the Crown Princess was a happy pulse (pregnant).For a time, several families were happy and some were sad.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin, who got off the ice rink, returned to the shed for a fire.After taking off the ice boots, Luo Shuyu roasted his cold feet on the fire and asked Li Mingjin tentatively, \"Does Your Highness like children?\" it's okay .\"Luo Shuyu turned his ankle and found that Li Mingjin stuttered a little in answer, and then looked up again, his eyes were still dodging.Does Li Mingjin not like children?The author has something to say:The Third Prince: wife, I like the process of making children the most! Are you feeling it now?Luo Shuyu: \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He believed that Li Mingjin wouldn't dislike children. After all, he spent several nights in his last life just to give the child a nice name.Luo Shuyu felt that he might be thinking too much. He had to think twice before doing anything recently, which was a bit habitual. He couldn't think about Li Mingjin in this way. This was the person he should rely on.Luo Shuyu emphasized again: \"Your Highness, do you mean that you don't want it for the time being?\"Li Mingjin didn't answer clearly, but asked him: \"Then do you want it?\"Luo Shuyu said with reason: \"I have seen a book, the book says, having a child too early may not be good for your health, if your Highness wants it later, I have no objection.\"Li Mingjin seemed relieved: \"Then let's wait later.\"Not only did Li Mingjin relax a bit, but Luo Shuyu also relaxed a lot. The two of them simply reached a tacit agreement to have a child later.Both parties had secrets that they were not willing to reveal for the time being.Since they didn't want to say it, they didn't ask each other. The two maintained such a tacit understanding until the end of the cuju trip on the ice.On the return journey, the sky was relatively gloomy, and it was estimated that it would snow again.The carriage shared by Emperor Tiansheng and Concubine Lin was at the front, the carriages of the princes were in the middle, and the carriages of other officials were behind.In winter, Li Mingjin no longer rode a horse just to look handsome in front of his wife, he just sat in the carriage with Luo Shuyu.Halfway through the journey, it really started snowing and a strong wind blew up.The team in the front stopped, and Li Mingjin sent someone to check what was going on.The guard came back after a while and reported that the road ahead had sunk due to the snow, and Emperor Tiansheng's carriage had sunk into a pit. At this moment, the carriage must be changed and the wheels of the leading carriage should be pulled out before moving forward.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin had the foresight. There was a brazier in the car, and Luo Shuyu had a hand stove in his hand. The two of them were not cold. As for whether the other people behind were cold or warm, it was unknown.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin chatted about road issues while sitting boredly.He remembered that Shen Mingyun often mentioned a sentence in the book, which was also the infrastructure suggestion that Shen Mingyun provided to the fourth prince through the system in the later period. Now that he thought about it, it really mader sense.Luo Shuyu leaned against Li Mingjin's arms, and found a comfortable position: \"Your Highness, the expert I knew before said something that I found useful.\"Li Mingjin was curious about what good advice Luo Shuyu had: \"What is it?\u201dLuo Shuyu said: \"If you want to get rich, you must first build roads. I didn't say it. It's all the experience summed up by the predecessors.\"He didn't dare to take the credit from others like Shen Mingyun.A person could do as much as he could, and Luo Shuyu didn't take credit for it.After thinking about it for a while, Li Mingjin really felt that it made sense. He thought relatively long-term, and had already considered the lifeblood of the entire country.If the roads were fixed, a lot of things indeed\u00a0 could be done.For example, if you ship a product one day earlier or one day later, the price may be different.The roads extend in all directions, and countries from all over the world come to court, so they were not afraid that their Daxia Kingdom wouldn't stand in the center, rich, land and people, and the annexation of the surrounding small countries was just around the corner.Li Mingjin couldn't help nodding: \"The words are rough and the rationale is not rough. I will give my father a suggestion when I go back tomorrow. In the spring, I can provide some work for the refugees so that they can earn money for the return journey.\"Luo Shuyu said in surprise: \"Is there any refugees?\" he hadn't heard Li Mingjin mentioned it before.Li Mingjin: \"Well, you mentioned the refugees to me last time, so I wrote it down and passed a note to the emperor. The refugees who should have gone to the city are now concentrated in the suburbs and the shed was built in advance, there was no big disturbance , so many people didn't know that there are refugees nearby, and it didn't cause panic.\"Luo Shuyu did mention it casually before, but Li Mingjin actually remembered it. He was still thinking that if the refugees really got to the city, he would give porridge in the name of the Third Prince's Mansion. Now that the matter had been resolved, he didn't need to worry about it anymore. His Highness actually had a benevolent heart.Luo Shuyu still said a few more words: \"The most important thing in winter is to keep warm. Clothes and food are very important. Your Highness must let the refugees mobilize themselves, otherwise they may cause trouble.\"Li Mingjin: \"Don't worry, there are special people watching. Father specially sent Lin Haiming's army to watch over those refugees, they dare not make mistakes.\"Luo Shuyu sighed: \"It's all caused by disasters.\"Li Mingjin: \"yes, I don't know how to solve this disaster, I'm afraid that next year will be more similar things.\"Luo Shuyu closed his eyes and tried hard to recall the contents of the book. Shen Mingyun didn't have the insecticide that he exchanged in the system, and there was another more suitable method, that was, herding chickens and ducks , these were the natural enemies of locusts, and it was said that they could effectively solve the problem of locusts.He told Li Mingjin this method: \"It's better to herd more chickens and ducks. I heard that these are the natural enemies of locusts. They can effectively deal with disasters, and they can also fatten chickens and ducks so that they can lay eggs.\"Li Mingjin knew that Luo Shuyu had never been in contact with animal husbandry and farming, but every little thing he mentioned could withstand scrutiny. Li Mingjin would be amazed by a random word. His thoughts were more real than any official, and he always felt enlightened: \"I will discuss this matter with my father. I am afraid that Yu'er will make great achievements in the future.\"\"I don't make great achievements. I just read one more book than others.\" A book that knew one's own destiny, used the life of the whole family was exchanged, and it was natural to give back to the family.Li Mingjin put his hands around his waist: \"Yu'er is humble.\"Luo Shuyu clasped his fingers tightly with his warm hands: \"I'm not humble, it's all thanks to His Highness.\"Li Mingjin: \"My credit is yours.\"While the two were flattering each other in the carriage, the guard knocked lightly on the door: \"Your Highness, a letter for you is suddenly stuffed beside the carriage.\"The\u00a0letter was handed in, and Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu opened the letter together.Li Mingjin frowned and said, \"It's sunny and surrounded by so many people, how could this letter appear here?\"Ever since Luo Shuyu knew about Shen Mingyun's props, he was no stranger to it: \"It must have been that someone took advantage of the chaos to put the letter here just now.\"Who would send a letter to Li Mingjin at this time?After opening it, they found that the content was quite interesting.The more Li Mingjin looked at it, the more he wanted to tear up the letter, the content inside was really unbearable.Luo Shuyu read it word by word with great interest, and then he threw the letter into the brazier and burned it bit by bit.Li Mingjin stared at Luo Shuyu's face, afraid that he would turn his back on him in the next moment: \"Yu'er, don't be angry, someone must be making fun of me, I'm innocent!\"From another point of view, this letter was a love letter, and it was still a very blatant and straightforward confession.Luo Shuyu asked him with a smile: \"Your Highness, why do you always think I'm going to be angry? When did I really get angry with you?\"\"When I slept on the couch...\" He answered very honestly.Luo Shuyu covered his mouth: \"Your Highness is stupid, how could I believe such an obviously provocative letter, and I can probably guess who sent it.\"Li Mingjin: \"Isn't that Princess Zhou?\"Luo Shuyu shook his head : \"Your Highness is a little anxious, so he only see one but not the other. Such an obvious trap is for us to jump, to make me separate from you, and to divide us.\"Li Mingjin's voice was slightly cold: \"Who did this kind of dirty thing?\"\"Naturally, someone who wants to make a profit but has no brains.\" Luo Shuyu already had an idea, and it was too impatient, and Shen Mingyun's brains were still not enough.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was probably because he had also grown up, and had a different view on people and things. When facing Shen Mingyun, he no longer felt that he was strong and irresistible, but went deeper. The more you got to know him, the more you discovered how superficial and unbearable this person.\"Take care of him later.\" Li Mingjin seemed to have guessed what Luo Shuyu was thinking, that his cousin Shen was really evil.He wanted to kill him, but his wife said that this person should not move casually, maybe there was an expert protecting him secretly, it was not good to startle the snake.Luo Shuyu also made a very hurtful suggestion: \"Your Highness, why don't we treat this person in the same way?\"Li Mingjin felt that his wife was really suit him everywhere, including these small plots: \"Okay, everything Listen to you.\"This letter was actually very simple, it was a love letter to Li Mingjin in the name of Princess Jiayang, the content was straightforward and unsightly. That was why Luo Shuyu could tell at a glance that it was Shen Mingyun's bad idea. He probably didn't know that today's love letters were quite reserved. Only people in Shen Mingyun's era would talk about \"love\" and \"like\" every day.Emperor Tiansheng's carriage drove back again, without encountering any obstacles along the way. Considering the snowy weather, Emperor Tiansheng asked them to return to their respective homes, so that they no longer had to follow his carriage to the palace. Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu also returned home smoothly.After arriving home, it was inevitable to freshen up first.Most of the lunch was meat. Luo Shuyu wanted to eat some noodle soup at night, and Li Mingjin didn't have any objections. The sliced noodles with chili oil were also quite delicious.At night, Li Mingjin inevitably had a toss with Luo Shuyu. He said during the day that he would eat Luo Shuyu at night.Luo Shuyu really thought he was joking, he was ashamed and speechless when being pressed and eaten, but he still enjoyed it afterwards, it was all the boudoir fun between husband and wife.The next day, the sky cleared.Li Mingjin went to court early in the morning, Luo Shuyu stretched himself after getting up, and went to Li Mingjin's study after breakfast.Now, the two of them shared a study room, and Li Mingjin wouldn't avoid him when dealing with official business, and occasionally asked for his opinion when he couldn't figure it out.Although Li Mingjin seemed to have nothing to do in the Ministry of Criminal Justice, the official still took him seriously and would often investigate some old cases for him.When Li Mingjin was away, Luo Shuyu would not touch his case file.He sat now in a chair covered with animal skins, thinking.Shen Mingyun's love letter yesterday really touched his back, and he actually made him and Li Mingjin's idea. Anyone who destroyed the relationship between other people's husband and wife would go to hell.It was conceivable that what Shen Mingyun wanted to do now was to destroy his relationship with Li Mingjin, so as to achieve the purpose of the system.He wondered if Shen Mingyun knew the purpose of the system issuing these tasks?It was very likely that the existence of him and Li Mingjin had caused huge obstacles to the fourth prince's ascension to the throne.Their obstacle had already been created, and now Shen Mingyun hadn't gained the trust of the Fourth Prince.And how should he and Li Mingjin get rid of them?At this time, Luo Shuyu told himself to fight steadily and not to advance rashly.He asked Qingwang for ink, turned his left wrist, and copied the letter he had read in the book written by Prince Zhou to Shen Mingyun.He dried the ink on the letter, folded it and stuffed it into an envelope.Then let Anjiu send the letter to Shen Mingyun, even if Shen Mingyun guessed that he did it, so what, this handwriting had nothing to do with him or Li Mingjin.He believed in Li Mingjin's loyalty to their feelings, so would Li Mingchun believe that Shen Mingyun was loyal to him?Sow discord, who wouldn't? It was just to see who's move was higher.That night, Li Mingchun waited for Shen Mingyun to return to bed after taking a bath.It took Shen Mingyun more than half an hour to take a bath back and forth. Li Mingchun was a little bored waiting, so he erected the pillow. As soon as he moved the pillow, he found a letter under it, signed by a flirtatious pink chrysanthemum.Li Mingchun was not only deep-minded, but also suspicious.He used some tricks to let Shen Mingyun enter the mansion, and he had no good intentions, so he naturally doubted Shen Mingyun's loyalty to him.He sat up straight and quickly opened the letter.The first line of words stabbed his eyes.[I love Yun'er: Not seeing each other every day is like three autumns...]After reading the full page of love letters at a glance, with trembling hands, he stuffed the letter back into the envelope according to the original crease, and laid the pillow flat.The ups and downs of his chest revealed the anger in his heart at this moment!How dare Shen Mingyun, how dare he accepted love letters from other men behind his backHow dare he be so skittish!Li Mingchun cared his chest, trying to suppress the chill in his eyes, he stared coldly at the door curtain of Shen Mingyun's shower room.Listening to him talking and laughing with the maid no longer felt pleasant, but rather harsh!Who was the man who hooked up with him?What did \"chrysanthemum\" represent?He only thought of one person related to \"chrysanthemum\", and that was the crown prince.He remembered how much the crown prince admired Shen Mingyun before he came back from the crown prince's other courtyard last time!Who did Shen Mingyun stay with during the few days he stayed in the crown prince's other courtyard, was it the crown prince? Or another man?No, there would be no one else except the crown prince, no one could enter the crown prince's other courtyard, only him!Li Mingchun not only thought of the blueprint of the waterwheel before, how did the crown prince get it? Could it be that Shen Mingyun gave it to the crown prince himself?If it was what he imagined, was Shen Mingyun in two boats?When they got acquainted, he knew that Shen Mingyun didn't care about the difference between a man and a ger, and he hung shoulders with others all day long, calling them brothers. In the past, he thought that he was a very interesting person with a real temperament, an out-of-the-box temper, and a different way of thinking from ordinary people, but now, Li Mingchun was stuck in his throat.When Shen Mingyun came out of the bath, he delicately put on very little clothes and sprayed on some perfume. Tonight, he wanted to do that kind of thing with Li Mingchun. The ger's body was different from that of a man, and doing that kind of thing would only bring pleasure. It was not too painful, and it was cool.Shen Mingyun, who had been nourished by the system's props, had delicate skin and was very beautiful. As long as he didn't speak, his demeanor was also very attractive.At this time, Li Mingchun was furious. Seeing that Shen Mingyun was about to seduce him, he suddenly felt a little nauseous. He frowned lightly, covered his stomach and said, \"I think I still have some things to deal with. Let's go to the study first. Go to sleep first.\"He needed to Be calm!Being with Shen Mingyun could indeed satisfy his pleasure, but he couldn't accept that Shen Mingyun flirting with other men after entering his mansion!For his great cause, would he endure it?When the relationship between the Fourth Prince and Shen Mingyun changed due to a letter, Luo Shuyu did not forget Princess Jiayang.Although autumn was over now, things were getting more and more up.Firstly, the Crown Princess was pregnant, and after a few days, it was reported that the First Prince's Concubine was pregnant, and they were scrambling to give birth to the grandson first.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin had a great time watching the play.The end of the year was approaching, and Luo Shuyu had to start another matter.Of course, in the past two days, someone had also been giving him hints frantically.For example, yesterday, someone deliberately put a raw egg on the table.Luo Shuyu pretended not to know, and said: \"Why do you bring the raw eggs, who doesn't want this monthly salary?\"Li Mingjin asked from the side: \"Yu'er, don't raw eggs remind you of anything ?\"Luo Shuyu said confusedly: \"Fried eggs?\"Li Mingjin shook his head: \"No, think again?\"Luo Shuyu: \"That's boiled eggs.\"Li Mingjin was a little anxious: \"Think about it harder? Raw eggs are not cooked.\"Luo Shuyu: \"That's hatching chickens.\"Li Mingjin: \"It's almost close.\"Luo Shuyu suddenly said: \"Oh, I see, Your Highness wants to discuss with me whether the chicken comes first and then the egg, or the egg and then the chicken.\u201dLi Mingjin gave his wife a complicated look, and asked someone to take the eggs to the kitchen to make omelets, and to feed his wife\u2019s brains at noon!The author has something to say: Third prince: Wife, let me see where you gave birth~~Luo Shuyu: ...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She has a habit reading novel while listening to music. When she is going to read a novel, she must ask some spoilers first so she can find the right song. Thanks to her I found this song...]Luo Shuyu already knew what Li Mingjin was implying madly.He was born in winter, which naturally implied that his nineteenth birthday was approaching.Before Luo Shuyu had a marriage contract with Li Mingjin, his birthday was not that important to Li Mingjin, but now that Luo Shuyu appeared, everyday with him was extremely happy, so naturally he hoped to get his attention, every festival he wanted to celebrate it with him.Li Mingjin thought that Luo Shuyu hadn't received his hint, and was extremely depressed two days before his birthday, and even missed a bowl of rice.And Luo Shuyu still read books, painted, and looked at the account book as if nothing had happened.The day before Li Mingjin's birthday, he stopped hanging around Luo Shuyu, and went into the study without feeling too excited.Luo Shuyu smiled behind his back.His Royal Highness was really cute. In the past two days, his birthday had been written brightly on his face. How could he not know, what was more, he never forgot, and already prepared a birthday gift for him early.Young people's birthdays were not very important, so they naturally celebrated it at home.Luo Shuyu remembered that in his previous life, Li Mingjin never held a birthday banquet. On his birthday, he only accepted the birthday gift from the palace, as well as the gifts from other officials. Luo Shuyu really never saw him ate longevity noodles. At that time, Luo Shuyu didn't know his habits, and didn't prepare it for him.Recalling his past self back then, he wished he could go back and beat up his past self. At that time, Li Mingjin must hope that he would give him a bowl of longevity noodles.On this day, Li Mingjin was reading in the study, he was afraid that his bad mood would affect Luo Shuyu.But Luo Shuyu was happy when he stayed in the study, and quietly arranged for someone to arrange for Li Mingjin's birthday tomorrow. He also received a letter from Concubine Mei and a bunch of gifts, but he put them away first, before taking them out. He prepared to give Li Mingjin a surprise tomorrow.This was what he learned from the book. In the book, Shen Mingyun often gave Li Mingchun a surprise in their modern way. Luo Shuyu thought that followed some modern people's ways were not bad, and he could also learn to use them on Li Mingjin, as long as both of them were happy. There was nothing wrong with that either.Luo Shuyu was now preparing a surprise for Li Mingjin, he would let him have a happy nineteenth birthday.This year was their first year of marriage, so they had to live well and made everyday a memorial day.At night, Li Mingjin hugged Luo Shuyu who had been busy all day tightly, and chewed on him for a long time before he could calm down. When he was about to tell Luo Shuyu that tomorrow was his birthday, he found that Luo Shuyu was so sleepy that he fell asleep.He really wanted to beat the bed. He shouldn't let him go early just now, let him take two more bites.If he didn't understand the hints tomorrow, he could just speak up, but he felt a little sad that his wife didn't know his birthday, and he had been giving him some hints for days!When Li Mingjin got up, Luo Shuyu also got up.He had to go to the morning court, and before leaving the door, he looked at Luo Shuyu who hung the jade pendant on him in a complicated way.Li Mingjin reminded him: \"Yu'er, think about what an important day is today.\"Luo Shuyu pretended to think hard: \"Oh, I don't know if Your Highness doesn't mention it. The day after tomorrow is the winter solstice.\"Li Mingjin: \"... \"He said today.So, Li Mingjin went to the morning court with resentment.In a bad mood, Li Mingjin had a cold face early in the morning. The fourth prince Li Mingchun, who was standing beside him, was also in a bad mood, he thought that he had found an ally.Li Mingchun: \"Third brother, are you also in a bad mood?\"He said sullenly, \"Who said I'm in a bad mood?, you're blind.\"Li Mingchun: \"...\" Your face was so cold!After going to court, Li Mingjin still went to the Ministry of Justice to get a job, and didn't return to the mansion. His wife didn't remember his birthday, and he would be in a bad mood when he went back.At this time, Luo Shuyu was very busy in the mansion.He had someone order fireworks a few days ago, and he asked Qingwang to see if the fireworks had been delivered.After that, he went to the kitchen to make a dish with the cook. He hoped that Li Mingjin could taste the meat made by himself tonight.It was a pity that the plum blossom wine he made couldn\u2019t be tasted so soon, otherwise it could be delivered to Li Mingjin's lips tonight.Luo Shuyu asked the cook: \"Is the amount of salt and soy sauce correct?\"The\u00a0cook: \"Yes, the third imperial concubine.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Okay, stewed it in a jar, His Highness should like it.\"Luo Shuyu, who rarely went to the kitchen in the past, stayed for most of the day today, and ate lunch more casuallyIn the morning, he learned how to stew meat from the cook, and in the afternoon, he learned how to make noodles. He wanted to serve Li Mingjin a bowl of longevity noodles.As the evening approached, Luo Shuyu sent someone to the gate to see when Li Mingjin would return to the mansion, and he could report to him as soon as he returned.Li Mingjin went back to the mansion in the early Youshi, and he went to the study as soon as he came back.[\u9149\u65f6\u00a0y\u01d2u sh\u00ed: 5-7 pm (in the system of two-hour subdivisions used in former times)]Apparently he was still feeling depressed that Luo Shuyu didn't know his birthday.Luo Shuyu made a bowl of noodles in the kitchen, and then went to the study with it.He knocked on the door.Li Mingjin was pretending to read a book, and there was no expression of joy on his face.Luo Shuyu called softly: \"Your Highness, are you busy?\"Li Mingjin: \"Not busy.\"Luo Shuyu asked him again: \"Then are you hungry?\"Li Mingjin: \"It's okay.\" In fact, he didn't eat enough at noon.Luo Shuyu raised his chin and pointed to the steaming noodles in the bowl: \"I made the noodles, do\u00a0 you want to eat it or not?\"Li Mingjin: \"Eat.\"Hearing that Luo Shuyu made the noodles himself, there was no reason for him not to eat it. It was too late for him to be happy.Luo Shuyu held the bowl in front of Li Mingjin, but was stopped by Li Mingjin: \"It's too hot, I'll do it.\"He found that Luo Shuyu's fingers were red, \"Are your hands hot or cold?\"Luo Shuyu put the red-hot fingers behind his back and clasped his hands: \"My hands are fine, eat quickly, Your Highness, or it will get cold later.\"Li Mingjin looked at him and then at the noodles in the bowl.Luo Shuyu chuckled lightly and said, \"Your Highness, why don't you ask me why I came here for you?\" He had\u00a0 been looking forward to this day for several days, but he didn't ask when it came.Li Mingjin went around the desk, he hugged Luo Shuyu, pulled his fingers in front of him, and kissed them lightly, his eyes were slightly hot: \"I'm a bit afraid to ask.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I made the longevity noodles for you personally, Your Highness, eat it quickly, or it will be cold.\"Li Mingjin reluctantly let go of him, he sat obediently at the desk and slowly ate the noodles made by his wife himself.Seeing that he was eating with gusto, Luo Shuyu asked, \"Is the taste okay?\"After he finished a bowl of longevity noodles, Li Mingjin wiped the corners of his mouth with a handkerchief: \"It\u2019s delicious, did you add sesame oil?\"\"Yes, I know you like that flavor.\" Luo Shuyu still understood him very well, especially His Highness\u2019 taste.Luo Shuyu picked up Li Mingjin: \"Your Highness, let's go to the main hall for dinner.\" After dinner, it happened to be completely dark, and then the fireworks were set off.Li Mingjin was satisfied, he listened to whatever his wife said!The depressed mood of the past two days was swept away by a bowl of longevity noodles.Li Mingjin was led into the main hall by Luo Shuyu, he could smell the strong smell of meat through the thick curtain.Sitting at the table, Li Mingjin was really amazed.Every dish was his favorite.Li Mingjin picked up the chopsticks and was about to taste them, but Luo Shuyu held down his hand: \"Your Highness, first guess which dish was made by me?\"Li Mingjin: \"Is it okay to guess while I taste it?\"Luo Shuyu: \"Alright.\"He picked up the jug and poured wine for Li Mingjin, \"You can't drink the plum blossom wine I brewed myself, but Your Highness can try this plum blossom wine. can you guess where it came from?\"Li Mingjin tasted a sip of plum blossom wine: \"You didn't buy it from outside...\" He took another sip and was stunned for a moment, \"Is it from the mother concubine?\"Luo Shuyu nodded: \"Yes, the mother concubine sent someone to deliver it last night, is it delicious? \"It was delicious, sweet and delicious.\" Li Mingjin licked his lips, regretting that he took a big sip just now.Luo Shuyu didn't give him any further aftertaste, and put a piece of his favorite braised pork in his bowl: \"Try this.\"Li Mingjin has no other hobbies, heis favourite was to eat meat in all aspects, he was particularly easy to satisfy.He affirmed: \"You made this one.\"Luo Shuyu smiled and said: \"How did Your Highness know?\"Li Mingjin said with reason and evidence: \"The cook in our house puts a lot of salt when he makes braised pork, which is more salty. Today's taste is a little sweet, I think it's not her who made it, it's you.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Your Highness can guess this, it's amazing.\"Li Mingjin praised him: \"I didn't expect you to have such good cooking skills \"Luo Shuyu smiled, and said in his heart that he had practiced for several days, and threatened the third party with a monthly salary not to report the matter to Li Mingjin.The dinner seemed homely, but it was all Luo Shuyu's kindness.The two ate slowly and drank some wine. At the end of the dinner, Li Mingjin was already intoxicated.Just after dinner, the outside suddenly became very bright.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin went outside.The snow in the middle of the courtyard was swept away, and the red candles formed the sentence.[Happy birthday to Your Highness.]Immediately afterwards, the dark night sky was replaced by the brightness of fireworks.Li Mingjin held Luo Shuyu's hand tightly.The first firework,The second,The third,The fourth...Until the last and nineteenth firework, Luo Shuyu said softly: \"Happy birthday, Your Highness.\"The\u00a0next moment, Luo Shuyu was held in Li Mingjin's arms, and Luo Shuyu hugged him back.Li Mingjin was so choked up that he couldn't speak, and in the end they all came together into two words: \"Thank you.\"Luo Shuyu did a lot for his birthday today.His mother concubine couldn\u2019t remember his birthday for many years, and it must be Luo Shuyu's credit that he could drink the plum wine she brewed this year.Luo Shuyu also personally cooked longevity noodles for him.This was something Li Mingjin never thought about. He really thought that Luo Shuyu didn't know his birthday at all, and he pretended too well.Not only that, he also ordered fireworks, and all the careful arrangements made Li Mingjin's heart that had become more and more indifferent over the years extremely warm.That night, Li Mingjin was so moved that he went to Yunyu with Luo Shuyu several times. Afterwards, he put his arms around Luo Shuyu and kissed his forehead: \"Yu'er, you are so kind to me.\"[\u4e91\u96e8\u00a0y\u00fan y\u00f9\u00a0\u00a0 lit. cloud and rain; fig. sexual intercourse]Luo Shuyu leaned into his arms and said, \"Your Highness is the one who treats me well first, and then I treat Your Highness well.\"Li Mingjin fumbled under the quilt: \"Then I will continue to treat you well?\"Luo Shuyu put his hands on his chest: \"I can't, I'm sleepy!\"Li Mingjin squeezed his reddish fingers, and kissed it lovingly: \"Understood, don't bother you, go to sleep.\"Luo Shuyu found a comfortable position to lie down, and soon entered deep sleep.On the other hand, Li Mingjin, after a day of ups and downs, he still couldn't fall asleep, he stared at Luo Shuyu's face for a long time before he started to feel sleepy.He had lived for nineteen years, and the happiest for him was this year, and he hoped it would be the same next year.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Many people saw the fireworks in the Third Prince's Mansion that night. Knowing that the third prince\u2019s imperial concubine accompanied the third prince to celebrate his birthday, all the gentlemen in the capital were extremely envious. If there was a wife like this, what more could a husband ask for?Nowadays, no one in the entire capital didn\u2019t know that the third prince had married a good wife.The fireworks on the third prince's birthday were told several times by the storytellers. Unknowingly, the image of the third prince in everyone's hearts had changed a lot.Even many families in the capital began to consider choosing a ger as their first wife. With a model like Luo Shuyu, a well-educated ger must be not bad.Luo Shuyu's mother, Chen Shi, came from a famous family. The Chen family was also well-known in the capital back then, but they had to stay away from the capital because of crimes. After all, even if he related to the Chen family, Luo Shuyu's identity had never humiliated the third prince. The two were considered a good match .Although Luo Shuyu became famous day by day and was favored by the third prince, such kindness didn\u2019t reach Luo Renshou.Although Luo Renshou's reputation rose because of Luo Shuyu, but because of Shen Mingyun's incident, even if everyone wanted to look for a wife but they still watched Luo Renshou\u2019s son and daughter from the sidelines.Luo Renshou's recent affairs were not going well. The whereabouts of Liu Shi's death hadn\u2019t been found out, and because he promised Luo Shuyu earlier, the funeral after Liu's death couldn't be held in a big way, so he could only find an underground burial hastily, and only the three of them, father and sons, knew about it.Furthermore, for the sake of Shen Mingyun who entered the fourth prince's mansion, Luo Shumo went out to get drunk everyday. In the past two days, Luo Shumo also redeemed a young man in a certain brothel and came back to, playing and singing in the courtyard every night, almost driving Luo Renshou to death.Not only that, Luo Renshou was also reprimanded for not satisfying Emperor Tiansheng for what he did. Everyone said that he gave birth to a good son, but unfortunately he was not lucky at all.After finishing the work, Luo Renshou decided to drink with his colleagues. That night, he slept outside and got a nephrite jade, a warm and fragrant Xie Yuhua..After the winter solstice.A lot of things happened again.The pregnant crown princess, who was protected like a treasure everyday, had a miscarriage, and this child was completely lost, and the crown prince was depressed for several days.On the other hand, the eldest prince was gloating.Luo Shuyu knew the world's affairs even if he didn't go out.However, on a sunny day, he still went out.As the end of the year was approaching, he wanted to buy some new year's goods and go shopping to see if there was anything new. He heard that Shen Mingyun had recently opened a fried chicken shop, which was said to be quite prosperous.Li Mingjin wanted to investigate an old case today, and had no time to accompany him, so he could only come out by himself.\u00a0He also wanted to buy Fumanlou's sauced elbow back to Li Mingjin by the way.Luo Shuyu didn't like to put on rouge and face powder, so naturally he didn't go to these shops, so he just walked around to have a look.As soon as he entered the jade jewelry store, he saw a line of words hanging on the wall on the left side of the store as soon as he entered the door.[The mutton fat jade bracelet that the third imperial concubine also loves! is your first choice!\u00a0]There was also a line of words hanging on the right.[The same style of the token of love from the third prince to the third imperial concubine!\u00a0]Luo Shuyu: \"...\"Why didn't he know that he had received these various tokens of love?The most important thing was that there were still many customers choosing in front of the counter, whoever came up with such a bad idea.After leaving this shop, Luo Shuyu also found other shops with similar idea...This one was the third prince's favorite pastry, that one was the third prince's favorite fan.Who used a fan in the winter.After walking around, Luo Shuyu almost didn't know who these \"Third Prince\" and \"Third Prince's Imperial Concubine\".It was quite cold outside, so Luo Shuyu chose to go directly to Fumanlou to buy sauced elbow and drink a cup of hot tea.As soon as he sat down, there were orderly shouts and chaotic footsteps from outside the street.Someone yelled \"catch the assassin\".Luo Shuyu opened the window and looked down, and he saw Li Mingjin who was sitting on the horse holding a whip, commanding the officers and soldiers around him with a majestic expression.Li Mingjin ordered coldly: \"Immediately seal this street! You can enter only and can\u2019t exit! Find the assassin!\"Luo Shuyu quietly admired the serious Li Mingjin.Li Mingjin downstairs suddenly raised his head, and happened to meet Luo Shuyu's gaze, and Luo Shuyu quietly waved at him.Li Mingjin not only saw his wife, but also saw a shadow flashing behind the curtain.He frowned and immediately got off his horse!Yu'er was in danger!The author has something to say:The third prince: Wife, let's play officers and soldiers to catch robbers tonight!\u00a0You get caught by me, I stripped\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0you off and then you stood against the wall!Luo Shuyu: ...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He thought that Li Mingjin got off his horse in a hurry to come up to see him.After closing the window, Luo Shuyu returned to his seat, and the waiter served him a pot of good Yundingshanwu (tea name).He tasted it, it was really delicious.It was not easy for the tea pickers to pick this tea, so he wanted to drink a second cup.Just as he was about to pour a second cup, a cold knife was placed on his neck: \"Don't move.\"Qing Wang, who had just stood beside Luo Shuyu, was knocked unconscious and fell to the ground.Luo Shuyu's hand holding the teapot paused slightly. He never thought that he would be in danger, but he quickly calmed down: \"Are you the assassin they are looking for?\"The assassin behind him said: \"I know you are the third imperial concubine.\"Luo Shuyu guessed that the person who came here should cover his face, his voice was suppressed, and he couldn't tell whether he had heard this person's voice before or not.He had died once, of course he was not afraid of death.Luo Shuyu put down the teapot with one hand and twirled the teacup with the other hand, still sit leisurely as if at home.He tried his best to keep calm: \"Then you are really powerful, I\u2019m not a big shot, I\u2019m just a person who is greedy for life and afraid of death, please don't scratch my neck.\"The assassin said: \"I think you are not at scared at all. The third imperial concubine is different from what I imagined, you are very calm, and many men are not as calm as you when this kind of thing happens.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Really? It\u2019s useless for you to hold me hostage.\"The assassin said: \"Who said it\u2019s useless, you will be useful.\" The person who chased him was the Third Prince after all.As soon as the words fell, the assassin's knife lay across Luo Shuyu's neck, just as Li Mingjin kicked in the door!Li Mingjin drew a sword from nowhere, and pointed at the assassin behind Luo Shuyu: \"Let him go!\"He then asked Luo Shuyu, \"Yu'er, are you okay?\"\"Your Highness, I'm fine.\" Luo Shuyu's voice was very stable and had the effect of soothing Li Mingjin's nervous heart.The assassin: \"Just like the rumors, although the third prince and the third imperial concubine got married not long ago, they are deeply affectionate and become the object envy of others.\"Li Mingjin said coldly: \"Let him go. If you hurt him even a little, I will kill you and your corpse will be cut into thousands of pieces!\"The assassin: \"Don't worry, the third prince, I also have the heart for a beauty, as long as you let me go, I will \u00a0naturally let the third imperial concubine go.\"Li Mingjin said without hesitation: \"Okay.\"No one's life was as important as Luo Shuyu's. If the assassin ran away, he would catch it again next time.The assassin: \"Prepare me a horse, water and food for three days.\"Li Mingjin: \"Okay, you let him go now.\"The assassin chuckled lightly: \"Is the third prince stupid or does the third prince think I\u2019m stupid to release the third imperial concubine?\"Li Mingjin stared fixedly at the assassin behind Luo Shuyu.Luo Shuyu was afraid that he would lose control of himself as soon as his emotions came up, so he said: \"Your Highness, promise him, I\u2019m fine, why don't you prepare a carriage for us outside the city first, and Your Highness will \u00a0pick me up outside the city, I believe he will \u00a0not kill me. \"Luo Shuyu already had an idea in his mind.The assassin: \" The third imperial concubine \u00a0is still reasonable.\"Li Mingjin had no choice but to follow Luo Shuyu's suggestion to prepare what the assassin requested.Luo Shuyu didn't know where this assassin came from.Now since they were waiting in the private room, he had a time to ask.Luo Shuyu take a piece of pastry and put it in his mouth: \"Who did you assassinate?\"The assassin: \"Of course it was to assassinate some people who shouldn\u2019t live in this world.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Is it family hatred or national hatred?\"The assassin was not stupid: \" The third imperial concubine is playing tricks on me.\"Luo Shuyu shrugged: \"only sitting her is also boring, why not eat the melon seeds and talk.\"The assassin was stunned, and said with a muffled laugh: \"The third imperial concubine was really not an ordinary person, no wonder even the third prince, this kind of tyrannical person also has a deep-rooted affection for you.\"\"This is a bit exaggerated.\" Luo Shuyu also talked to him in a normal way.The assassin suddenly had the intention of showing off again: \"I assassinated the crown prince of your \u00a0Daxia Kingdom, isn't it very heroic?\"Luo Shuyu was taken aback, but his expression was fleeting.After everyone in Fumanlou was evacuated, Luo Shuyu and the assassin got into the carriage prepared by Li Mingjin.Anyone who heard the news knew that the assassin had kidnapped the third imperial concubine.For a moment, the entire imperial city was on alert.This assassin must be too courageous, didn't he know that the third prince was still the one who must take revenge?\u00a0How dared he to hold his imperial concubine as a hostage, he was a brave person!Li Mingjin was afraid that the assassin would hurt Luo Shuyu, so he followed the carriage closely on horseback, but the assassin threatened him with a knife, so he could only follow from a distance.Luo Shuyu wanted to give Li Mingjin a secret sign, but the two of them seemed to have never practiced tacit understanding, and he might not even know the secret sign.However, he secretly made a gesture to calm down Li Mingjin, hoping that he would think about it.Li Mingjin's ability to survive to this day was inseparable from his ingenuity.There was only one assassin, and Luo Shuyu was now his gold medal for avoiding death, so he didn't dare to do anything to him.Fortunately, the fur coat that Luo Shuyu wore today was newly made by Li Mingjin before winter. Sitting in the carriage, as long as there was no wind, he wouldn\u2019t feel cold.However, the assassin's clothes didn't look very warm.The carriage was about a mile away from outside the city, and Luo Shuyu suddenly asked him: \"Princess Jiayang, are you cold?\"The masked assassin was taken aback, his voice almost changed, and he asked Luo Shuyu, \"Who is Princess Jiayang?\"Luo Shuyu chuckled : \"Don't pretend, I know it's you. I compared your height at the ice rink that day, and you are half a head taller than me. I also don't think any princess will go to the wrong place when someone else goes to toilet.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It's a pity that you married the third prince, not the crown prince, otherwise you can still assist him to ascend to the throne.\"Luo Shuyu sighed: \"It's just fate.\"Princess Jiayang pulled off the mask in his face: \"I didn't expect you to guess it\u2019s me.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Actually, I didn't dare to guess it was you. If it's an ordinary assassin, maybe I really can't guess who it is. But when we just got into the carriage, finally, I found that you have the scent of jasmine on your body, so I guessed it was you, since you also had this scent on the ice rink that day.\"Princess Jiayang said: \"The observation details are in place. If you are in our country, you will definitely have a good future. In our Zhou kingdom, a ger could also go to the court and become an official.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Then are you a ger or a man?\"Jiayang The princess said: \"You can guess again.\"Luo Shuyu: \"According to what you just said about the fact that your gers can be an official, I guess you should be a ger. Even if you pretend to be a woman, you will \u00a0not be suspected. A man has an adam's apple but a ger doesn\u2019t have it.\"Princess Jiayang: \"Smart.\"Luo Shuyu still wanted to find out who the prince of Zhou kingdom that Shen Mingyun hooked up with in his previous life.Luo Shuyu asked him: \"I want to ask you a question.\"Princess Jiayang liked Luo Shuyu's wit: \"You ask.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Where do you rank on your royal family?\"Princess Jiayang: \"Fourth.\"Luo Shuyu remembered that the prince who hooked up with Shen Mingyun in the book was ranked second in the royal family of Zhou kingdom. Since Princess Jiayang was a ger, not a man, it meant that the second prince of Zhou kingdom hadn\u2019t yet started to show his face.Luo Shuyu said: \"Is your second brother also came to Daxia?, or the plan to assassinate the crown prince this time actually is not your idea, but your second brother's idea?\"Luo Shuyu thought of the sudden miscarriage of the crown princess. Presumably the Prince of Zhou kingdom had been hiding behind his back, with the purpose of provoking the Daxia royal family. He assassinated the Crown Prince,and then took the blame to the First Prince, resulting in only a struggle within Daxia Kingdom.Now that it could be confirmed that Princess Jiayang was not the prince, it could be inferred that the second prince of Zhou kingdom was still hiding in the capital and continuing to make a plan. Princess Jiayang's marriage was just a cover, and he was just a cover for the second prince of Zhou kingdom to enter the capital.Princess Jiayang said: \"Third imperial concubine, I want to destroy the agreement with the third prince. You are too smart, I can't just let you go back like this.\"Luo Shuyu then said: \"It's also possible that I guessed wrong, you and your second brother are not from the same group, otherwise you will not have exposed your whereabouts so quickly.\"There was a battle for the throne in Daxia, and Zhou kingdom also had it, and the competition in Zhou kingdom was even more intense. Not only could their gers go to the court as officials, they could also be the emperor, otherwise Jiayang wouldn\u2019t pretend to be a woman and sneak into Daxia, trying to disturb the muddy water of Daxia.Princess Jiayang smiled: \"No matter how much you guess, it's useless, I won't tell you.\"Luo Shuyu: \"It doesn't matter, I don't know martial arts, and I won't investigate cases when I\u2019m not an official. The princess just treats me as an idle speculation.\"Princess Jiayang: \"You are really interesting. If you are born in our country of Zhou, we should be good friends.\"Luo Shuyu: \"I think so too.\"Princess Jiayang: \"We are coming to Wangyou Pavilion soon, let your men don't follow me anymore.\"Luo Shuyu smiled: \"Princess, don't worry, His Highness will definitely do what he said.\" But it should be limited to the fact that he was still in the hands of Princess Jiayang.When they arrived at the pavilion, Princess Jiayang quickly got on his horse and ran away with the horse, leaving Luo Shuyu.Only the coachman and Luo Shuyu were left behind.Luo Shuyu asked the coachman: \"Anjiu, bring him back to me.\"Anjiu: \"But His Highness hasn't come yet.\"Anjiu was quite surprised that the third imperial concubine was held hostage with a knife and he was so calm, and just now he ordered him to chase the assasin. He was very courageous.Luo Shuyu: \"Alright.\"He jumped out of the carriage and stretched his arms. He hadn't been outside the city much.The outskirts of the city in winter had a different scene.After a while, Li Mingjin arrived with the team. The people behind chased the assasin, while Li Mingjin rushed in front of Luo Shuyu.He was so worried: \"Yu'er, are you injured?\"Luo Shuyu shook his head: \"I'm fine, I'm fine, don't worry.\"Li Mingjin hugged him in his arms: \"I'm scared to death.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Aren\u2019t I okay?\"He hurriedly diverted Li Mingjin's attention, \"I haven't been here yet, Your Highness, let's sit in the pavilion for a while.\"Seeing that he really didn't look frightened, Li Mingjin poked his forehead: \"Really heartless.\"Luo Shuyu smiled, took his hand and walked towards the pavilion, Anjiu and the guards helped them to clear the snow accumulated in the pavilion, and put two tuanpus.[\u56e2\u84b2\u00a0tu\u00e1n p\u00fa: refers to a round mat woven from cattail grass, which is mostly used by monks when they sit in meditation and worship. ]Luo Shuyu didn't pretend to joke with him and said directly: \"I know the identity of that assassin.\"Li Mingjin was a little surprised: \"Who? How do you know his identity?.\"\"We've all seen him before.\" Luo Shuyu patted the snow that fell on his shoulder.\"The person we discussed at the ice rink.\"Li Mingjin immediately thought of it: \"Princess Jiayang?\"Luo Shuyu: \"Well, I just confirmed his identity. He was a ger, not a man.\"Li Mingjin : \"How could it be him?\"Luo Shuyu: \"The status of a ger in Zhou kingdom is comparable to that of a man, so it\u2019s not surprising that he is.\"Li Mingjin: \"I know, but I didn't expect them to be so daring and go directly to assassinate the crown prince.\"Luo Shuyu: \"But I think Princess Jiayang may just be a target, and the real thing to guard against was their second prince.\"Li Mingjin : \"How do you say it?\"Luo Shuyu: \"The miscarriage of the crown princess was definitely not an accident, nor it was caused by the eldest prince. I guess there are people from Zhou kingdom trying to fish in the muddy waters.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At first, no one found out that it was Zhou kingdom who did it, but now he suddenly came forward. Maybe Zhou kingdom\u2019s second prince\u2019s group and Princess Jiayang group have never reached a consensus.\"Li Mingjin understood Luo Shuyu's meaning: \"It seems that Zhou's royal family is also quite chaotic. There are far more people who hinder than those who can work. They all want to take credit, but there are also people who want to take all the credit.\"Luo Shuyu praised him at the right time: \"Your Highness is wise. \"So the Princess Jiayang in the previous life was defeated by the second prince in Zhou kingdom\u2019s internal strife, and so he didn\u2019t appear in the tribute team.After smoothing out the relationship here, it became clear why there was no such person as Princess Jiayang in the previous life.\u00a0What was more, Shen Mingyun saved the second prince of Zhou Kingdom in his previous life, and he didn't know where he was now. When he was injured, he appeared in the Zhuangzi that Shen Mingyun bought privately. Now that Shen Mingyun had entered the fourth prince's mansion, he had too little time to go out and wander around, it was impossible to live in Zhuangzi, so it was impossible to meet the second prince of Zhou Kingdom.[\u5e84\u5b50\u00a0Zhu\u0101ng z\u01d0: farmstead]So, because the whereabouts of the second prince of Zhou Kingdom was unknown, and Princess Jiayang decided to make his own decisions?There was too little information, Luo Shuyu could only rely on guesswork, but it was a good thing that the fact that Zhou Kingdom planted spies in Daxia had known.Emperor Tiansheng had already sent people to investigate this matter, and things would\u00a0\u00a0become clearer. The second prince of Zhou Kingdom would\u00a0\u00a0show his face sooner or later. Maybe he would\u00a0\u00a0meet Shen Mingyun again, it was just a matter of time.Li Mingjin held Luo Shuyu's hand tightly: \"It's still Yu'er who is smart and helped me solve a big problem. That Princess Jiayang, I must capture him alive.\"Luo Shuyu asked him: \"It's freezing cold, Your Highness, where do you think that Princess Jiayang will settle down?\"Li Mingjin took out a sharpened knife from his ankle, and lightly scratched a few marks on the table: \"There is a small town in three mile to the east, if you don't rest and keep going, if you ride fast with the horse, it will take half a day to reach the next place where you can stay.\"\"Is there another path?\" Luo Shuyu asked him, \"Jiayang is being hunted, and will he\u00a0\u00a0blatantly follow the official road?\"Li Mingjin: \"There is another trail, but in snowy days, unless you are used to hunt and run around in the mountains, no one can cross it directly.\"Luo Shuyu asked him with his chin in his hand: \"Then how can he avoid the pursuers and ensure that he can survive, while she doesn't wear thick clothes and with limited food.\"Li Mingjin had a flash of inspiration: \"It\u2019s very likely that he will return to the city within two days.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Your Highness is right, as long as you find him, you can wipe out all their spies. \"Actually, rather than cleaning up Zhou Kingdom\u2019s spies, it was better to say that he was paving the way for Li Mingjin from now on.There was nothing more real than gaining real power. This was the only way to keep them alive.Li Mingjin nodded. He didn't want Luo Shuyu to waste his brain too much. After watching the snow scene with Luo Shuyu for a while, they returned to the city in a carriage.The assassination of the crown prince and the kidnapping of the third imperial concubine by the assassin in the street caused a lot of uproar. The mastermind had escaped, and only a few young men were captured. Endless torture and death awaited them.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin went back to the mansion directly. It was freezing cold. After Luo Shuyu took a comfortable bath, Li Mingjin asked him to stay in the room to keep warm, and he was not allowed to go anywhere. Being sick and catching a cold was not easy.That night, Li Mingjin hugged Luo Shuyu tightly in fear.In his dream, he dreamed of a carriage full of arrows. In the dream, Luo Shuyu's face was pale and his eyes were flustered. Li Mingjin was break out in a cold sweat, and then woke up.On the second day, the news that Luo Shuyu was held hostage by the assassin spread like wildfire, and the news that the crown prince was assassinated was suppressed, and rumors about Luo Shuyu being held hostage by the assassin spread everywhere.The palace sent people to send a lot of precious items, it was self-evident who did this.Li Mingjin stared fiercely at the gift from the queen: \"The prime minister is so scheming, he actually used Yu'er as a shield!\"Luo Shuyu patted him on the back and gave him a soft smile: \"Your Highness, don't be upset. When I was kidnapped, many people have seen it, since they want to use me, why don\u2019t we create a reputation for ourselves and turn our disadvantages into advantages?\"Li Mingjin: \"Does Yu'er have a good plan?\"Luo Shuyu: \"We may need to use Mr. Chen, presumably he has a perfect solution, mainly because he has a good literary talent.\"Li Mingjin's eyes lit up: \"Yu'er means to create momentum for us?\"Luo Shuyu nodded: \"Well, the prince wasn't injured, but I was taken hostage outside the city and frightened, so it's not too much to use it. \"Li Mingjin: \u201cOf course it\u2019s not to much.\u201dChen Rong really lived up to expectations, within two days, the whole capital was spreading the story of Luo Shuyu's heroic fight against the assassin!The storytellers in the teahouse all said this: \"The third imperial concubine, with the spirit of preferring death than surrender. At that time, when he was fighting the assassin in the snow, struggling to hold on, when the sharp knife almost pierced his neck, finally the third prince who descended from the sky came! he saw the third prince showing off his might and fighting the assassin for 300 rounds, the carriage was shaken to pieces, and finally rescued the third imperial concubine from the assassin! In the end, the husband and wife must be of the same mind, and its benefits can cut through gold!!\"Later, Luo Shuyu asked Chen Rong why the story was so exaggerated, it felt like the third prince was about to grow three heads and six arms!Chen Rong couldn't say a nonsense: \"This script was written by His Highness himself, and there was more exaggerated version, but I strongly rejected it.\"Luo Shuyu: \"...then he must be very sorry.\"Although it was different from the original idea , but, so be it.The author has something to say:The third prince: Wife, do you think my paintings look good?\u00a0Ninety-nine poses!\u00a0Let's use the hundredth one tonight~~Luo Shuyu: ...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This matter involved various conflicts of interest. He didn\u2019t want Luo Shuyu to be put under a high wall. Even if he told Emperor Tiansheng, it would only end up being Luo Shuyu's one-\u00a0sided\u00a0words, and Emperor Tiansheng might suspect that they had bad intentions, so he simply concealed the matter, and everything was still based on evidence.Luo Shuyu only needed to act as if he was a victim.For this reason, he was also called into the palace twice to accept the care and gifts from everyone in the harem. After the limelight passed, the husband and wife could be regarded as quiet and live their own little days.However, the matter of catching the assassin still fell on Li Mingjin.Among all the princes, the third prince was neither the crown prince nor the eldest prince. Emperor Tiansheng originally wanted to choose the fourth prince, but considering that he refused to marry Princess Jiayang before, he gave up. At least the third son still had the strength and there were capable officials below to help him, and the investigation of the assassin could also become a training for him.In this way, Li Mingjin led people to look for the assassin inside and outside the capital everyday.According to Luo Shuyu's proposal, he strictly screened the people who came into the city everyday, even the farmers who went to the city to sell fruits and vegetables.The hard work was paid off, and he really found something.This Jiayang princess didn\u2019t return to the city, but he didn\u2019t leave the capital either. Although it was different from what they guessed, it was still the same.Li Mingjin couldn't help lamenting that his wife was a planner as good as a god, and if he was a man, he would definitely be the number one scholar in the examination.When Li Mingjin's subordinates checked the gate of the city, they found a few people with different accents. After he sent some people to follow them, they found that these people lived in an unoccupied house on the outskirts of capital, a little distance from other villagers, and they hadn\u2019t been discovered yetLi Mingjin sent people to stay there for three days, and found some new things. Even though it was an unoccupied house, but there were quite a few people coming and going everyday. All of them were very familiar, and many of them were the court officials. Li Mingjin asked his subordinates to record the specific time when these people came and went, and also recorded their conversations.Those who dared to come here were those who were not afraid of death, at this juncture they could be called collaborating with the enemy.\u00a0However, it was also possible that these court officials were actually the spies of the Zhou Kingdom. They worked harder than others and got a higher position.Moreover, some of these officials often had close contacts with the crown prince or the eldest prince.Li Mingjin reported the matter directly to Emperor Tiansheng, which caused Emperor Tiansheng to be furious, so he directly sent more people to him to continue the investigation.Li Mingjin ran outside everyday to investigate the assassin\u2019s matter, Luo Shuyu was a little worried about him, the weather was getting colder, and he was afraid that he would get sick, so he would let him drink a bowl of ginger soup everyday when he returned to the mansion.Compared with Li Mingjin who was running outside, it was much easier for Luo Shuyu who entered the palace and fought wit with the women in the palace.It was nothing more than being stabbed by the crown princess, or catching the trap thrown by the eldest imperial concubine, not to mention the queen and queen dowager. He had to respond everyone well, otherwise it would only cause trouble for him and Li Mingjin.However, since the crown princess lost her child, she seldom went out. She just came to the queen to pay her respects, and occasionally happened to meet Luo Shuyu entering the palace. It was a big blow to her, and the child that many people were looking forward to disappeared just like that.On the other hand, the eldest imperial concubine with a slightly protruding belly had a red face all day long, she became more and more round and smooth, she smiled at everyone, which was in stark contrast with the crown princess.After the fight between the Crown Princess and the First imperial concubine, it was the turn of the Empress and Concubine Lin to fight. On this day, there were no newborn prince or princess in the emperor's harem.In recent years, Emperor Tiansheng always had some physical problems, and he didn't pay much attention to the matter of spreading branches and leaves. Now the people in the harem were fawning on the queen and Concubine Lin, and the people behind them were like a seesaw, one after another.Luo Shuyu saw everything in his eyes. Every time he entered the palace, he waited to watch the play, and when he went back after watching the play, he went to visit Concubine Mei. When he returned to the mansion, he would always bring some fresh fruits or vegetables. After a trip to the palace, those who didn't know thought he went to the vegetable market.Today, he entered the palace again to \"chat\" with the concubines in the harem, and Luo Shuyu took every precaution to prevent them from bringing the topic to him.The Crown Princess didn't like to talk with everyone recently, so she didn't participate in the topic very much. With the support of the Queen, no one dared to bring up sad things in front of her.Ever since the first imperial concubine got pregnant, her temperament became flamboyant. It was not easy for her to offend the crown princess, but Luo Shuyu, who was not yet pregnant, she could make a fuss. Only sitting was boring anyway.\"Shuyu, we have already held a banquet this year. Why don't you hold a banquet? It's pretty boring these days.\"Luo Shuyu really wanted to gag her mouth with His Royal Highness' socks. She didn\u2019t stay at home and raise her baby well, instead she wanted to join in the fun and asked him to hold a banquet.He had to find the right time to hold the banquet, if there was something wrong with the gold bumps in her stomach, who could talk to him for reasoning?, the eldest prince was still arguing with Li Mingjin all day long.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The money from the banquet was exchanged for food and sent to the refugees.\"With such a deep understanding of righteousness, even the queen and the concubines present were moved, and the topic changed from the banquet to the refugees.The concubine Wei Xian, who was also a ger, said: \"Your Majesty, this concubine thinks that the third imperial concubine\u2019s words are right. Why don't we make a charitable donation and buy some food or winter quilts for the refugees, which can be regarded as solving His majesty's problems.The queen looked at Luo Shuyu in a different way: \"I see.\" she really regretted that she didn't choose Luo Shuyu to be the crown prince's side concubine.Luo Shuyu was a little surprised that Concubine Wei spoke for him. In the past, Concubine Wei Xian basically didn\u2019t participate in these open and secret fights, but today was really a bit unusual.Concubine Wei Xian\u2019s original name was Wei Xi, and he was the ger of General Zhenbei. After entering the palace, he had been very favored. He occupied a certain place in Emperor Tiansheng's heart, but he never had a child of his own. It was also a means of saving his life. After all, his father hold important military power in his hands. If he had his own children, the situation in the harem would be different today.In the end, the matter of charity donation naturally fell on the Crown Princess. Such a good deed that could bring fame, of course, the queen wanted it to fall on her own son. It just so happened that the Crown Princess had just had a miscarriage, so she also had reason to do good deeds.Luo Shuyu didn't have the slightest complaint about this, on the contrary, he was fine with nothing. The fact that he was held hostage by the assassin a while ago was already enough of a show, so there was no need to do it again.Before leaving, Luo Shuyu quietly fell behind and thanked Concubine Wei Xian.Concubine Wei Xian smiled and said: \"You don't need to thank me, Concubine Mei often sends me some vegetables, which very suitable for my taste, and it's just a little effort.\"Luo Shuyu really didn't expect that Concubine Mei and Concubine Wei Xian still had friendship, but after thinking about it, maybe it was just an excuse.After leaving the palace, Luo Shuyu didn't know that the people who served Concubine Wei Xian was also very puzzled.The manservant: \"Master, why did you help the third imperial concubine today?\"Wei Xi took off the wooden hairpin and asked, \"What do you think?\"The manservant: \"Do you sympathize with the third imperial concubine?\"Wei Xi chuckled: \"He doesn\u2019t need my sympathy, that child is smart.\u201dThe manservant: \u201cTis slave is stupid, please give me some advice master.\u201dWei Xi said patiently: \u201cToday, could you see that the first imperial concubine intends to embarrass him?\u201dThe manservant: \u201cIsn\u2019t it normal to hold a banquet?\u201dWei Xi: \u201cThink about the current situation, the Crown Princess has just had a miscarriage, and the First imperial Concubine has a full stomach, who dares to invite her to the house. If something goes wrong, who will be responsible? He is smart because he could use the current events to resolve a dispute smartly, and others won\u2019t take his fault. He not only rejected the first imperial concubine, but also passed the steps to the crown princess. It\u2019s a pity that his idea is great but the first imperial concubine still didn't understand it.\"The manservant: \"This is killing three birds with one stone.\"Wei Xi: \"He has a good heart. When everyone is using their heirs to compete for favor, he pays attention to the common people. It's really not comparable to the other two.\"The manservant: \"If only the master also has his own heir, how could it be like this?\"Wei Xi smiled: \"It's better to be alone.\"The manservant: \"The master will help the third prince and his imperial concubine because of the letter master recently received?\"Wei Xi: \"That's right.\"How could it be so easy to become General Zhenbei, otherwise, why, he as a young master still had to eter the palace. When he helped Luo Shuyu today, he also had his own selfishness, and it was hard to appease.After Luo Shuyu returned to the mansion, she told Li Mingjin about the matter Concubine Wei Xian speaking for him.Concubine Wei Xian suddenly helped him today was a bit unexpected, and it was different from what he had known in his previous life.His words were not just as simple as helping, Concubine Mei's credit?\u00a0Certainly not, Concubine Mei was notoriously unreasonable, and she and Concubine Wei Xian hadn\u2019t had much contact with each other. It may be possible to deliver some food to Concubine Wei Xian, but it was not enough to let him speak for him. It was still to offend Concubine Lin and the first prince.Of course, other people wouldn\u2019t dare to touch Concubine Wei Xian, he was also the target of the two groups, if one of them could get the help of General Zhenbei, there was nothing to fight for.Li Mingjin was cutting an apple for Luo Shuyu with a knife, and stuffed a piece into his mouth: \"Concubine Wei Xian spoke for you?\"After swallowing the apple, Luo Shuyu said: \"Well, I feel a little strange, he said that he has a relationship with the concubine mei because of vegetables and fruits, but I think it\u2019s not true.\"Li Mingjin: \"Indeed, I guess it should be General Zhenbei.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Why does Your Highness think so?\"Li Mingjin: \"Father made an order yesterday to let him return to the imperial court.\"Luo Shuyu: \"At this juncture the master will return to the imperial court? Is it the meaning of father?\"The nomads in the north would often cross the border to snatch food in winter, and it was winter now, and it was not suitable to return to capital.Li Mingjin: \"Someone has made a statement, what father might be thinking about?\"Luo Shuyu: \"What about the person who will succeed General Wei?\"Li Mingjin: \"Now the crown prince's faction and the First Prince's faction are still arguing, and they both want to send their own people. They have been arguing for more than a month.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the previous life he really didn't care much about the current affairs. He knew that General Wei's group would return to the court, but he didn't know who would be sent to replace him. The fourth prince and Shen Mingyun went to the north, but it was not now.After he came back, many things were advanced, first was his marriage with Li Mingjin, and then Shen Mingyun's entry into the fourth prince's mansion.Luo Shuyu opened his mouth to eat another piece of apple, but Li Mingjin didn't feed it into his mouth, and he urged him: \"Your Highness, apple.\"Li Mingjin pinched his chin: \"I'll give it to you when you call me big brother.\"[\u54e5\u54e5\u00a0g\u0113 ge: older brother]Luo Shuyu: \"...\" Your Highness's face is getting thicker.Li Mingjin: \"Yu'er, I want to hear you call me big brother.\"\"Then I won't eat.\" Luo Shuyu's face was hot and he turned his face away to ignore him. Li Mingjin really had the ability to add a little digression when talking about serious business.\"Not good, you have to eat it.\" Li Mingjin bit the last piece, met Luo Shuyu's lips, and directly fed the apple into his mouth. Luo Shuyu had to eat it, and Li Mingjin asked him, \"Is it good?\"Luo Shuyu blushed, and glared at him: \"You can sleep on the couch tonight!\" After speaking, he was about to get off to the bed, but was hugged by Li Mingjin from behind.\"Okay, I know I was wrong.\" Li Mingjin just wanted to hear him called him big brother once, but if he didn't call now, he would\u00a0\u00a0call on the bed later, \"Let's continue chatting.\"Luo Shuyu gave him an angry look: \"Then you move your hand away\u00a0.\"Li Mingjin patted the back of his right hand with his left hand: \"Oh, it put it down by itself, it has nothing to do with me.\"Luo Shuyu was amused by him: \"Sit down, Your Highness, if you tease me again, I won't talk to you.\"\"This time I make sure that I will speak well,\" Li Mingjin said.The atmosphere was gone, and he was still talking, Luo Shuyu didn't know what to say about him, so he had to let him sit up straight and find a comfortable position to rest on his lap.Luo Shuyu urged him: \"Your Highness, continue to talk.\"Li Mingjin: \"Oh, what we were talking just now?\"Luo Shuyu: \"The candidate to replace General Wei.\"Li Mingjin: \"It hasn't come out yet, but I think the fourth child is interested in this.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Does Your Highness really think it will be good for the fourth prince to go? But he has Shen Mingyun by his side.\"Li Mingjin: \"That's true, then don't let him go, it's better to send our own people.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Who?\"Li Mingjin: \"Lin Haiming.\"If you wanted to push someone then it was better to push your own people, but it also needed an opportunity. Li Mingjin needed to discuss these more in-depth matters with Chen Rong. After all, Luo Shuyu still had his own shortcomings.\u00a0Most of the events in the book he read only mentioned the results but not the process. He could only remind Li Mingjin predictably, without knowing the specific people and events.The little details that Shen Mingyun didn't care about in his previous life were all things that Luo Shuyu needed to pay attention to now.The charitable donation was initiated by the Crown Princess, and noble ladies from all over the capital rushed to donate surplus food and unwanted clothes and quilts. Although it was the fire burns one's eyebrows, it could indeed save many refugees in the suburbs.[\u71c3\u7709\u4e4b\u6025\u00a0r\u00e1n m\u00e9i zh\u012b j\u00ed lit. the fire burns one's eyebrows (idiom); fig. desperate situation; extreme emergency]By doing this, the Crown Princess gained a lot of goodwill for herself, and was even praised by Emperor Tiansheng for a while, and it was rare for the Crown Princess to have a smile on her face.On the day she was praised by Emperor Tiansheng, the first imperial concubine complained sourly to the first prince after returning home.The first imperial concubine: \"It's clear that she didn't come up with this idea, but the queen insisted on it.\"The first prince: \"It\u2019s not her idea, then whose idea?\"The first imperial concubine: \"I originally wanted my third sister-in-law to hold a banquet, but he said it was inappropriate now, so he came up with the idea of charity donation. The queen said yes, I thought the third sister-in-law was going to handle this matter, but who knew that the queen had arranged this matter for the crown princess, how can I not be angry?.\"The first prince: \"The third sister-in-law was also impressive, with this kind of thing and he doesn\u2019t get angry\u201dThe first imperial concubine: \"I didn't see it, he usually looks kind and distant to everyone.\"The\u00a0first prince: \"Maybe the third brother really doesn't want that position, otherwise how could they give up such a good opportunity?.\"The first imperial concubine: \"What do you think, Your Highness?\"The first prince sneered: \"The crown prince has benefited from this, so the quota to go to the north should be given to us.

Tonight was very exciting, and both of them were very satisfied.But the next morning, Shen Mingyun found that his stomach hurt a little, and there was some redness on the bed!Half a day later, Luo Shuyu received a message from An Jiu.He read the content of the message twice.Shen Mingyun was pregnant?\u00a0?\u00a0?The author has something to say:The third prince: Wife, big brother wants to penetrate your body tonight.Luo Shuyu: ...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Emperor Tiansheng was infected with the cold and couldn\u2019t go to the court. The crown prince and the first prince took turns to serve the medicine in front of Emperor Tiansheng. Li Mingjin also went to see Emperor Tiansheng.In the past two days, Emperor Tiansheng's spirit had improved. Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin went to the palace to visit Emperor Tiansheng, fulfilling their responsibilities as a son and daughter-in-law.On the way to the palace, Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin whispered how they would stand after entering the palace.Li Mingjin leaned into Luo Shuyu's ear and said, \"The crown prince and the first prince will be here today.\"Li Mingjin would stick tightly to him every time they were in the carriage, and Luo Shuyu leaned against him habitually. He squeezed a date and put it in his mouth: \"Why did Your Highness choose this day to visit the palace?\"Li Mingjin: \"Of course it's because there are many people today.\"Luo Shuyu smiled lightly: \"I didn't expect Your Highness to be so humorous.\"Li Mingjin reached out to his chin, motioned him to spit the date seed in his hand, Luo Shuyu didn't bother to move, just spit out the seed in his hand, and waited for Li Mingjin toss the date pit into the small bucket before wiping his palm with a handkerchief.Li Mingjin reached out to his chin and motioned him to spit the date pit into his hand , Luo Shuyu was too lazy to move, and directly spat out the date seed in his hand, and waited for Li Mingjin to throw the date seed into the small bucket and wipe his palms with a handkerchief.Li Mingjin said solemnly: \"I'm very humorous every night, I'm afraid Yu'er has forgotten.\"Luo Shuyu couldn't help but give him a supercilious look: \"Should we stand farther later?

After all, every time he and Li Mingjin went to the scene was just out of formality, it was better to say that they went because of filial piety than to watch the fun, and they still had to become someone else\u2019s background board.Li Mingjin: \"Well, that's why we have to go today.\"Luo Shuyu also knew that Li Mingjin couldn't go to see Emperor Tiansheng alone. As long as he did this, the other people would definitely come up with countless reasons for him to want to ascend the throne, and they had to avoid this as much as possible.The two entered the palace while talking and eating. Before getting off the carriage, Li Mingjin helped Luo Shuyu to see whether there was any pastry crumb on the corner of his mouth, and Luo Shuyu helped Li Mingjin to pull out some of his hair, making him look a little more decadent and haggard.The two helped each other and took care of each other before getting out of the carriage.After entering the palace, they found that they came quite late. The queen, concubine Lin and others were all present, and the concubines were all standing outside blowing the cold wind and were not allowed to enter.In fact, Emperor Tiansheng really just contracted a cold. With several imperial doctors from the Imperial Hospital watching over him, there would be no major problems at all.Everyone present had different thoughts.Everyone wanted to know Emperor Tiansheng\u2019s physical condition as soon as possible, so they would naturally know how to arrange the following affairs after returning.Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu went forward to kowtow to Emperor Tiansheng first, Luo Shuyu saw the face of Emperor Tiansheng clearly, he was much more haggard than he saw last time, his face was pale, his lips were bloodless, there were more white hair than last time, he had no energy, as if he aged ten years overnight.No wonder the crown prince and the others were so anxious to come to fulfill their filial piety, they were afraid that Emperor Tiansheng would not be able to recover suddenly.But Emperor Tiansheng had obviously panted when he spoke.According to the timeline in his previous life, in the few years when Emperor Tiansheng's condition was relatively serious, the fight between the crown prince and the first prince became intense, and then gave the fourth prince an opportunity to take advantage of it.Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu died in the battle between the three major factions, which lasted for about five years.After the death of the two of them, the first prince failed in rebellion, and the fourth prince succeeded in saving himself. Less than three months later, the crown prince was deposed.After that, the fourth prince stayed with Emperor Tiansheng and handled the memorial for him. Emperor Tiansheng wrote an imperial decree to pass the throne to the fourth prince. He had no other princes to choose from.The rest were just teenagers or underage princes. They were not as talented as the fourth prince, not as courageous as the fourth prince, and not as good as the fourth prince, so Emperor Tiansheng could only choose him.Now, the timeline was moving forward. Luo Shuyu didn't know if the first prince would rebel in advance. His uncle had military power and could control the imperial city very well, the could force Emperor Tiansheng to abdicate.At present, the fourth prince hadn\u2019t gone to the north yet. Although Shen Mingyun was still making money, it was only a small amount of money. There was a hundred gaps away from the rich and invincible country. He didn't know if he would have the opportunity to go to the north.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The queen looked proud, and then she went back to her palace with a bit of pride. Emperor Tiansheng kept her son aone, it was the same to give her face.As for Concubine Lin, she looked good-tempered on the surface, but the way she held her veil tightly showed her real emotions.The First Prince helped Concubine Lin and left.Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu followed the crowd to leave the palace, but they were only halfway when the eunuch beside Emperor Tiansheng chased and stopped them.\"The Third Highness, The Third Imperial Concubine, His Majesty has something to say to the two of you.\"Li Mingjin frowned: \"Why did father suddenly ask us to go back?\"\"The Third Highness, I don\u2019t know.\"Seeing that the eunuch really didn't know, Li Mingjin glanced at Luo Shuyu, finally they followed the eunuch back to Emperor Tiansheng's bedroom.At this time Emperor Tiansheng had already sat up, he was drinking ginseng soup. The crown prince was not there and had already left.Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu didn't quite understand what Emperor Tiansheng wanted to do.Emperor Tiansheng said: \"Sit down. I'm not as weak as you imagined. I'm tired of hearing them crying. you two are quiet, have lunch with me before leaving. \"It was not easy for Li Mingjin to judge whether the concubines of Emperor Tiansheng were crying well or not, so he sat down calmly, and Luo Shuyu also sat down.Emperor Tiansheng rarely spoke softly: \"Today we are chatting at home, so there is no need for Shuyu to be nervous.\"Luo Shuyu replied with a smile: \"Go back to Father emperor, not nervous.\"At this point, it was almost time for lunch.It was just that Luo Shuyu didn't know what kind of routine Emperor Tiansheng wanted to talk to them about.On the contrary, Emperor Tiansheng lost the impatience when he faced the Queen and the others, probably because his sick face was a little pale, but it was better than before.Emperor Tiansheng took the initiative to speak: \"I think you two are living a good life now.\"Li Mingjin: \"It\u2019s very good.

Emperor Tiansheng didn't trust his yue family. There was nothing wrong with the crown prince alone, but there were too many things involved behind it.[\u5cb3\u5bb6\u00a0\u00a0 yu\u00e8 ji\u0101: wife's parents' home]The lunch was delivered, half meat and half vegetarian, and the meat dishes were Li Mingjin's favorite.Come to think of it, Emperor Tiansheng knew what he liked.Li Mingjin didn't move his chopsticks, Emperor Tiansheng urged him: \"Why don't you move your chopsticks, it doesn't suit your taste?\"Li Mingjin rubbed his nose, he sniffed quietly, both Luo Shuyu and Emperor Tiansheng could hear him clearly.\"I didn't expect father to remember that the son like to eat meat.\"Emperor Tiansheng thought that the third child was too easily moved, and the smile on his face became softer: \"In the future, I will ask the imperial kitchen to make it for you and send it over. \"Li Mingjin's tone became brighter: \"Thank you, father.\" He quickly put a piece of braised pork ribs in his bowl.Seeing his appearance, Emperor Tiansheng whetted his appetite, and started to eat: \"Come over and have a few bites with me when you have time.\"Li Mingjin: \"It must be, Father's cooks are better than my family's, can I take him away?\"Emperor Tiansheng: \"All right, all right, I will arrange the one who can make the braised pork ribs to come to your mansion.\"Li Mingjin: \"I want the one who can make this mushroom dishes, give him to me.\"Emperor Tiansheng immediately understood what he meant, Luo Shuyu's first chopsticks picked the mushroom dishes.Luo Shuyu nudged Li Mingjin with his elbow, intentionally letting Emperor Tiansheng to see, and whispered: \"Your Highness!\"Emperor Tiansheng laughed and said, \"I'll send him to you later, just two cooks.\"The young couple loved each other, he was also very happy.After finishing lunch with Emperor Tiansheng, Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin left the palace without disturbing his rest.Of course, the news that the two of them had lunch with Emperor Tiansheng also spread throughout the harem.The next day, Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu understood Emperor Tiansheng's intention of \"promoting birth\".When Emperor Tiansheng went to the morning court after his illness, the first thing he did was to choose the candidates who would go to north.It was not the crown prince or the first prince, let alone the fourth prince Li Mingchun, but it was Li Mingjin, who everyone thought was uncompetitive.Yes, he would lead the troops to north and replaced General Zhenbei.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if Luo Shuyu didn't know Li Mingjin's whereabouts most of the time, he also knew that Li Mingjin would not leave the capital.Now, if Li Mingjin went to the north, he really didn't know what to do, and probably thought about his safety all the time.In his heart, he knew that Li Mingjin's departure to the north would be a great help to his future, but in his heart, he didn't want him to travel far away.If he went to the north, he may have to go to the battlefield, and the sword had no eyes on the battlefield, who knew if he would be injured.Luo Shuyu didn't know martial arts, he didn't know how good Li Mingjin's martial arts, but even if he lost a hair because of the war, he would be terribly sad.Ever since Emperor Tiansheng ordered Li Mingjin to prepare to go to the north, Luo Shuyu became more and more worried and didn't sleep well for three consecutive days.Li Mingjin knew that he was uncomfortable, and the two of them hadn\u2019t been separated for a day since they got married, so he could only hug him to comfort him at night.Waking up in the morning, because Luo Shuyu didn't sleep well last night, he was actually very sleepy, but he just couldn't fall asleep.It didn't snow today, Luo Shuyu stood at the door watching Li Mingjin practicing martial arts in the snow-swept yard.Li Mingjin was sweating a lot from practicing, but in order to let Luo Shuyu watch his skill for a while, he gave himself an extra quarter of an hour to fight against the secret guard, so that his morning martial arts practice wouldn\u2019t become so boring and increased the viewing experience.Ansan could only cooperate with Li Mingjin's performance. The two of them really played tricks when they came back and forth.Luo Shuyu looked very happy, the amount of breakfast finally returned to normal level, and began to face up to the matter of Li Mingjin's departure to the north.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin went to the study room, he asked him, \"Is Your Highness going to leave in the spring or after the new year?\"Li Mingjin: \"The exact date hasn\u2019t yet been determined, but I guess it will be determined when General Zhenbei returns to the capital, after the New Year \"Luo Shuyu: \"Then when the last time General Zhenbei went to the capital?\"Li Mingjin: \"It\u2019s said that it may be many years ago, and he may rush back to reunite with his family.\"Luo Shuyu: \"If only I can go to the north with Your Highness, I also want to see the scenery in the north.\u201dLi Mingjin: \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve never been there, I know that place is colder than the capital. I heard that the snow is as high as your calf. You have to run as soon as the wind blows, and it's better to stay in the capital comfortably. Yu'er, you can rest at home and wait for me to come back.\"Luo Shuyu was dissatisfied with Li Mingjin's description of himself: \"Your Highness also underestimates me too much. I will run away whenever the wind blows.\"\"It's just your waist.\" Li Mingjin pinched his waist that couldn't get fat no matter what, \"Look at mine again, aren't you just suitable to stay at home and wait for me?\"\"Your Highness is not serious again.\" Luo Shuyu began to prepare the ink, \"By the way, Your Highness, is there any news about the doctor that Mr. Chen helped to find?\"\"No news yet.\" Li Mingjin didn't know why he suddenly started to prepare the ink, \"do you want to write? \"Luo Shuyu laughed and said: \"Write the one hundred and eight prohibitations on going out for Your Highness.\"Li Mingjin's face froze slightly: \"What is one hundred and eight prohibitations on going out?\" He wondered if his wife had any new ideas for dealing with him.Luo Shuyu: \"I heard that the atmosphere in the north is more open. Whether it's a ger or a woman, as long as they have interest in a man, they will go to the other's house with their bundle. Your Highness is a handsome man with sword eyebrows and star eyes, and he can't be taken by them. So...\"Li Mingjin: \"So what exactly is your one hundred and eight prohibitions?\"Luo Shuyu coughed: \"First, Your Highness is forbidden to look at other women or gers when you are bored, and you can only miss me.\"Li Mingjin asked curiously : \"What about the second one?\" This one could be done.Luo Shuyu picked up a brush and wrote: \"Your Highness is forbidden to go to various dirty places, so as not to be tempted.\"Li Mingjin said again: \"Then the third?\"Luo Shuyu: \"Your Highness is forbidden to save a ger or woman whose origin is unknown, because that might be the enemy's beauty trick.\"Li Mingjin put his hand on Luo Shuyu's waist: \"Yu'er, I just found out today that you really have ideas, why will someone send a son or a woman to seduce me?.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Not only there will be a beauty trick, but there will also be tricks to sow discord. There are many more that Your Highness doesn\u2019t expect.\"Li Mingjin kissed the back of his fair neck: \"Then why don't Yu'er accompany me to the north, so I don't have to be afraid that I will fall into the enemy's thirty-six tricks. \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s easy to hide a sharp spear, but it\u2019s difficult to guard against a dark sword. Your Highness must act with caution..\"Li Mingjin felt that he might be a little bit overwhelmed: \"Yu'er, you are overthinking. I\u2019m only representing father, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the soldiers below will listen to me, and the army\u2019s morale will not be disturbed because of me.\"Luo Shuyu emphasized: \"But I believe they will all be loyal to Your Highness.\"\"Believe me so much?\" Li Mingjin's hand on his waist tightened.Luo Shuyu looked back at him: \"In this world, the only one I can trust is Your Highness, if I don't trust you, who should I trus?t.\"Li Mingjin hugged Luo Shuyu tightly: \"Me too.\" He just hugged him tightly, not wanting to let go.Only from Luo Shuyu he could get the warmth that he had never had before. Luo Shuyu was not willing to part with him, so how could he be willing to part with him? He didn't know how long it would take to come back after this trip.Li Mingjin kissed Luo Shuyu, and Luo Shuyu took the initiative to kiss him back: \"Your Highness, don't worry about me, I will live well myself, and I will write a letter to you regularly.\"After the kiss was over, they returned to the topic.No matter how reluctant he was, Luo Shuyu was still going to tell Li Mingjin the information he knew: \"Your Highness, the journey is long and difficult, but it\u2019s also an opportunity.\"Li Mingjin nodded: \"I know, if I have military achievements this time, I will get credit.\"Luo Shuyu smiled: \"Not only that, this is just superficial, and the really powerful one is here.\"Li Mingjin didn't quite understand what he meant by this sentence.His wife had another great idea?\"What do you mean?\"\"Your Highness, sit and wait for me for a while.\" Luo Shuyu pushed him on the chair, and then he stood up and began to draw on the paper.Li Mingjin was obedient and sat in the chair, waiting for him to draw.At first he thought that Luo Shuyu was drawing a landscape, but later his expression gradually became solemn.Luo Shuyu's drawing was definitely not an ordinary drawing, but a map, and he marked some symbols on the map.Li Mingjin endured the doubts in his heart and patiently waited for him to finish the drawing.In the end, Luo Shuyu did draw this map into a landscape drawing, covering up the symbols he marked earlier.Li Mingjin knew that there were secrets hidden among the mountains of different symbols, and now he was eager to know what these symbols represented.Luo Shuyu finished the last stroke, but didn\u2019t add his own seal, but asked Li Mingjin: \" Your Highness, can you remember where the triangle symbol is?\"[Most Chinese paintings have small red impressions in a stylized script, placed either inconspicuously at the painting's outer boundaries, or scattered liberally through the image area itself. These seals (or \"chops\") can indicate either who executed the painting or who owned it.]\"Remember.\" His memory was not bad, and he had the ability of photographic memory since he was a child, but he had hidden it for many years, and no one remembered it over time.But he was puzzled by one thing, how could Luo Shuyu draw the map, he had never even been out of the capital.Luo Shuyu knew what he was wondering: \"Your Highness, are you wondering why I drew this map?\"Li Mingjin probably knew that he was going to use that mysterious expert to explain again: \"That mysterious expert told you?\"Luo Shuyu said frankly: \"I will definitely not harm Your Highness.\"\"I know you will not harm me.\" But was this expert too mysterious? He actually sent someone to look for him secretly, but this person never appeared, as if he was just a Luo Shuyu\u2019s shadow. Sometimes he thought that his wife could always predict whether there was something special about others, but he couldn't tell him the truth, so he called his ability as a \"mysterious expert\".People who had intelligent like a monster tend to be fearful and suspicious, and his wife probably didn't want him to doubt him.To say how special and capable Shen Mingyun was, Li Mingjin may not have a deep understanding, but he knew exactly how powerful his wife was.Since he didn't want to mention it, then he wouldn't ask, let's mention it when he was willing to talk.As long as he was not a fairy, he didn\u2019t want become a Cowherd and a Weaver Girl with his wife.Luo Shuyu: \"Do you remember the location of the largest mountain I drew?\"Li Mingjin pointed to the paper and said, \"Remember, this mountain has no peaks. \"The painting skills were so good that Li Mingjin even wanted to go to this place after seeing it.Luo Shuyu told him the truth: \"You Royal Highness, you must remember this location. If you have time, you can go there in person. This is an iron ore mine.\"What an iron ore mine represented was self-evident.Li Mingjin stared at the drawing in disbelief, and clenched his fists: \"Is it really an iron ore mine?\"Luo Shuyu nodded affirmatively: \"I will not deceive Your Highness, this mine is relatively hidden and needs to be found, I only know that it\u2019s in the direction of the north , called Wufeng Mountain, there is a village surnamed Yang at the corner of the mountain, it may be on your way to the north, I don\u2019t know how to find it.\u201dIn the book, Shen Mingyun and the fourth prince found this mine by accident. At that time, the large army was stationed to rest and the two took advantage of the night to leave the large army and ran out to have a tryst. Unexpectedly, on their way back to the camp, they encountered heavy rain and met an assassin, and the two rolled down the mountain.This time there were no kind villagers rescued themPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They also found a cave that could shelter them from the rain, and there were many food and warm clothes left by the Orion.The Fourth Prince was not Liu Xiahui either, and the two of them started a fire in the cave.After the rain stopped, they went up the mountain to pick fruits to fill their stomachs, and accidentally discovered Wufeng Mountain and the iron ore mine on the mountain. They were lucky to be rescued by the villagers of Yangjia Village. The two finally arrived in the town safely and found the local official to escort them to join the big army.After the fourth prince returned to the capital, he sent people to Wufeng Mountain again, and found that it was really an iron ore mine. The iron ore could be used to forge weapons, laying a solid foundation for his future road becoming emperor.If Li Mingjin got this mine, there would be no need to talk about the future.Since Luo Shuyu mentioned the mine, he knew that in the future, he must walk on a road full of thorns, and Luo Shuyu was willing to accompany him on the journey, and was also willing to help him.\"Do you remember that you said before that you have nothing? You don't have nothing, you have everything. You are my lucky star. With you, I have the motivation to move forward.\"Luo Shuyu suddenly hugged him tightly: \"The trip this time must be extremely dangerous, you must be careful to protect yourself.\"Li Mingjin kissed his forehead: \"Of course.\"This trip was definitely dangerous.At this critical moment, if he got the military power that the Crown Prince and the First Prince didn\u2019t get, then both he and Luo Shuyu would be in danger. If he was not by Luo Shuyu\u2019s side and left him alone in the capital, he was really worried.The more he thought about it, the more he felt that the capital was more dangerous than going to the north.However, there was still some time before leaving the capital, and even if they left, they would still have to celebrate the New Year.Today was New Year's Eve, Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu must enter the palace to have a reunion dinner with Emperor Tiansheng, which was also a rare family banquet for the royal family.Emperor Tiansheng gave all the officials of the court a holiday today, and only started to go to the court on the tenth day of the Lunar New Year.Luo Shuyu had already bought the New Year's goods, and this morning, he and Li Mingjin pasted couplets in the yard together.These couplets were written by Li Mingjin himself.In order to make up for the regrets in the previous life, Luo Shuyu cherished every festival now, and he was also willing to leave good memories with Li Mingjin.At this moment, Luo Shuyu stood under the bamboo ladder and shouted to Li Mingjin who was standing above: \"Your Highness, move it a little to the left.\"\"Is that so?\" Li Mingjin asked him.Luo Shuyu: \"Yes, it looks much more comfortable this way, and both sides match up.\"Li Mingjin finished pasting the couplets, came down from the top, and said to Luo Shuyu, \"From now on, we will paste the couplets together every year.\"Luo Shuyu held the brush to paste and said: \"Okay!\"The two not only pasted the couplets, but the servants also replaced the old lanterns and hung up the new ones.Sweeping away the dust (\u9664\u5c18) started on the 26th, and now the whole house was clean.It was cold in winter, Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin entered the palace relatively early, and when they arrived at the palace gate, they met the fourth prince, Li Mingchun.Since Shen Mingyun became pregnant, his time to go out had been relatively reduced, but recently he had been doing more in the court. For the sake of going to the north, he actually contributed money and effort. Originally, Emperor Tiansheng was lingering between him and Li Mingjin, but suddenly Shen Mingyun became pregnant and Emperor Tiansheng considered that in recent days in order to catch an assassin Li Mingjin almost sacrificed Luo Shuyu\u2019s life, so he chose him.The fourth prince felt like spoiling the ship for a penny worth of tar in the matter of going to the north, but he was not discouraged. There was the first prince ahead of him, and he used tricks to weaken the crown prince's support in the court.[\u529f\u4e8f\u4e00\u7bd1\u00a0g\u014dng ku\u012b y\u012b ku\u00ec: to spoil the ship for a penny worth of tar; lit. to fail through lack of a final effort]The first prince thought he could sit back and relax, but before Emperor Tiansheng gave the officials the annual holiday, a huge problem appeared in this year's disaster. The people in a southern state rebelled. Although it was suppressed immediately, it also exposed the problem.The south was more affluent than the north. Why did the people live in dire straits because of the snowstorm, and it came to the point of rebellion, didn't the imperial court distribute relief food?.Investigated, you had to investigate, you had to investigate it thoroughly.And whose territory was in the south, the Great Prince's family was there.The first prince's people secretly pushed the fourth prince to go to the south to investigate the matter. Emperor Tiansheng agreed, although the crown prince was still unwilling to do so, who didn't know that the fourth prince and the first prince were in the same group, and what did it mean to send the fourth prince to the south, but what was the use of being angry? Emperor Tiansheng had already made a decision.Except for Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin, no one knew what the fourth prince was thinking.The fourth prince and the first prince were in the same group?\u00a0The first prince may feel that what happened to Li Mingchun had nothing to do with him, but the first prince probably didn't know what benefits the fourth prince had obtained by using his power these years. He had never taken Li Mingchun seriously, and as for Li Mingchun's trip to the south this time, it may be a bit difficult to fulfill the first prince's wish.One would go to the north and one would go to the south.The third prince and the fourth prince were wary of each other at this time.The fourth prince: \"Third brother.\"Li Mingjin: \"Fourth brother.\"The fourth prince: \"I heard that the climate in the north is cold, and the third brother must bring enough clothes when he goes to the north after the new year.\"Li Mingjin: \"I also heard that there are many savages in the south, fourth brother should be careful.\"Luo Shuyu suddenly interjected: \"Fourth brother, I heard that cousin Shen almost had an accident, how is he now?\"Fourth prince: \"... \"This was a bit like a needle was pricked in the heart.Because it was said that during Shen Mingyun's confinement period, there were some blind girls in the fourth prince's backyard, and the child in his stomach almost couldn\u2019t be saved.His rest period for pregnancy was extended for another month on the basis of the original one month.The author has something to say:The Third Prince: Wife, I feel pain!Luo Shuyu: Where does it hurt?The Third Prince: Here, it hurts.Luo Shuyu: ...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

During the rest period, he said that Li Mingchun didn't have time to accompany him, and he suddenly sympathized with the people in the backyard. When he was bored, he invited them to drink tea and chat together in the courtyard.But these people all entered the fourth prince's mansion with a purpose, and Shen Mingyun's good intentions would eventually be paid by mistake.These people had other intentions. Of course, those who entered the Fourth Prince's Mansion wanted to gain the favor of their master. They only felt jealous of Shen Mingyun, and regarded his kindness as malice, so they joined forces to punish Shen Mingyun, so when they went outside to enjoy the snow together, Shen Mingyun accidentally fell and almost had miscarriage.In the end, Shen Mingyun was saved by the system, but the fall was a bit heavy, so he invited the imperial doctor.Whether the child in Shen Mingyun's womb could be kept or not really depended on fate. The ger also needed to conceive in 10 months, but now less than three months had passed.After the fourth prince learned the truth, a group of people with no names and titles in the backyard were still not cleared out of the fourth prince's mansion, but they were all locked up.\u00a0It was just that they should never compete with Shen Mingyun again, and they didn't have that chance.Li Mingchun also knew that this matter couldn\u2019t be covered, and he had a record after consulting to the imperial doctor, but when Luo Shuyu asked, he really lost face.What Luo Shuyu mentioned was not about Shen Mingyun and his children, but about his terrible backyard.With this question, Li Mingchun thought that it was no longer appropriate to continue talking about going to the north and going to the south with Li Mingjin, so he chatted casually to get away.The more times he entered the palace, Luo Shuyu became more and more familiar with this process, and he could naturally accept the people and things he encountered.Seeing other people understood each other's routines was better.For example, the first imperial concubine had a big belly now.As soon as Luo Shuyu entered the door, he saw the palace maid was helping her to sit down slowly, and the first imperial concubine was still rubbing her stomach to show off that she was pregnant.Among the several imperial concubines, she was the only one who was pregnant. Even the first prince walked with his head upright and straightened his chest everyday in front of Emperor Tiansheng. As for the one who was pregnant in the fourth prince's residence, they didn't care. A good concubine, even if the child was born, was not considered a heir, and more importantly, whether the child could be born smoothly was still needed to be \"discussed\".Today's arrangement was still similar to the Mid-Autumn Festival, but more than four months had passed, and everyone's life was different, and everyone's expression was different.Four months ago, the Crown Princess, who was so beautiful, now only had a sneer on her face, while the first imperial concubine, who used to be kind to everyone in the past, was showing off her might, as if she would give birth to the first grandson for the royal family tomorrow.The performance of the several imperial concubines were equivalent to that of their husbands, and so the favor they received from Emperor Tiansheng.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin were no longer newlyweds, their silence had reached a certain level, and they already knew what kind of posture they should make on which occasions.This year's New Year's Eve dinner was bigger than any royal family dinner in a year.When Emperor Tiansheng arrived, Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin discussed what dishes to serve later.It was not yet time for the banquet to start, and Emperor Tiansheng, the Queen Dowager, and the Queen were not seated.Waiting only was also boring. Last time at the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet, the Crown Princess deliberately made things difficult for the newly married Luo Shuyu, but it ended in an interesting ending, and she failed to achieve her goal. Today, she obviously had no intention of speaking.In this huge palace, there were only seven of them and the serving ladies and eunuchs.Now that Li Mingjin was mentioned to the face by Emperor Tiansheng, the Crown Prince and the First Prince would still speak bitterly to him.But it wasn't the crown princess who spoke out, but the confident the first prince.The first prince: \"Third brother, make preparations to go to the north after the new year. You have lived in the middle of the capital for so many years, and you have never been out of the capital yet.\"Li Mingjin\u00a0was eating the orange that Luo Shuyu had peeled for him. He was propping his cheeks with his hands on the table, he casually spewed the orange core onto Luo Shuyu's palm.\"I have never been out of the capital, so my first brother wants to go to the north for me?\" Li Mingjin had always been outspoken and shameless.The first prince was choked, and his thoughts were directly spoken out by him. His expression was very ugly: \"What did the third brother say? Your first brother still has to stay at the capital to accompany your sister-in-law to give birth. How can it be possible for your first brother to go to the north, and why should I rob your task? Swords and knives on the battlefield have no eyes, and the folk customs in the north are harsh, so I\u2019m afraid even if I think about it.\"The crown prince sneered at the side: \"Brother, do you believe what you say?

You came to mock me because you didn't get the chance to go to the north for your brother-in-law. \"Both of them were equal to each other. If you hurt the enemy one thousand, you would get hurt eight hundred.The crown prince said again: \"Didn't you recommend your brother-in-law who was ignorant?\"As soon as the first imperial concubine heard her family being scolded, she said: \"Your Highness, how did my brother offend you?\"The crown princess also joined the battle and slapped her hand on the table: \"The first prince scolded my elder brother first, and we can't finish without an explanation today!\"The two parties poked their hornet\u2019s nests and quarreled.Li Mingjin pinched Luo Shuyu's fingertips under the table, signaling him to leave it alone, and the two of them just watched the fun, which was in line with their style.The fourth prince pretended to look left and right, with an anxious expression on his face, and occasionally said a few words, but every sentence was as loud as a mosquito, and he also didn't want to care about it either.The quarrel at this time was intensified, if the First imperial concubine didn\u2019t have a big belly now, the Crown Princess would go forward and scratch her face.The crown prince: \"There's no end to this, isn't what we're talking about the truth?

It\u2019s better to go home and nurse the child!\"It was obvious that the first prince had the upper hand, and the crown prince almost fell backwards in anger.Luo Shuyu secretly wrote down the \"rumors from ten years ago\" mentioned by the first prince. was there any big problem in it?\u00a0This should be the information he missed in his previous life.When the crown prince and the first prince got up to perform martial art, the fourth prince called the guards outside to come in and pull the two of them apart!Emperor Tiansheng came in with a group of concubines just at this time.\"What are you doing?\"The crown prince and the first prince quickly separated, each straightened their clothes, straightened their hair and crowns, and hurriedly saluted Emperor Tiansheng.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin also got up to salute Emperor Tiansheng after watching the play.It was quite interesting to make such a fuss on New Year's Eve.In previous years, Emperor Tiansheng would still entertain the ministers, but this year he was not in such good health, so he skipped the banquet with the ministers and changed it to a pure royal family banquet.Unexpectedly, the crown prince and the first prince would come out like this directly, which made Emperor Tiansheng even more troublesome.But his ability to pretend to be deaf and dumb had already been practiced to the peak, he pretended not to see anything, and his tone was very gentle.The crown prince and the first prince had already married and established a family, and it wasn't just a day or two for the two of them started competing. He really couldn't control the frequent of their quarrels.After Emperor Tiansheng took his seat, the family banquet officially began.When the crown prince and the first prince returned to their seats, they stared at each other from an angle that Emperor Tiansheng couldn't see.After everyone was seated, the Queen Dowager also arrived after paying homage to Buddha.Exciting all night.First, there was the sword-fighting between the crown prince and the first prince, followed by the subtle mockery between the queen and Concubine Lin.Emperor Tiansheng only drank and ate the food, accepted the toasts from the princes and concubines, occasionally said a few words to the queen mother, and then watched the performance, completely ignoring the fight between the queen and Concubine Lin, maybe he was tired of watching it long ago, and was only bored with their fight in his heart.Compared to Emperor Tiansheng's disregard and indifference, Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin ate quite happily.The two also discussed what seasonings were in each dish.After the chat was almost over, they toasted Emperor Tiansheng at an inconspicuous time. At this time, Emperor Tiansheng only needed the tenderness of his \"family\", and he didn't need hypocritical compliments.For them, Emperor Tiansheng had different feelings.Li Mingjin acted like a willful child, and after toasting, he asked Emperor Tiansheng for a cook: \"Father, why don't you give me the cook who makes spicy crispy meat?\"His father refused him with a smile: \"\u00a0That won't work, I also like that crispy meat, and he is the chef of my imperial kitchen. If I send him to you, where can I find someone like him in the future?, it's not worth it, or I'll let him make it for you at regular intervals and send it over.\"Li Mingjin: \"Father is a bit stingy, you have more than one cook, I\u2019ll exchange three cooks with you.\u201dThe father: \u201cYou think well, I\u2019ll ask someone to find you a good cook later, don\u2019t just think about eating meat everyday, put your heart into doing things for me.\"Li Mingjin: \"Oh, it's so boring to do things.\"The Emperor Tiansheng laughed when he teased him, which was what a child should say to his father.As people got older, they started wanting different emotions.It's not easy to set off Li Mingjin with the crown prince and the first prince as examples. Emperor Tiansheng suddenly felt that he could get closer to the third son and care about him more, so that this son didn't care about his throne anymore.Although the Queen dowager didn't care about things, her eyes were still vicious. She was the one who gave birth to Emperor Tiansheng, so she naturally knew what he was thinking, so she immediately called the crown prince and the queen to toast Emperor Tiansheng again, and squeezed Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When passing by the main street, Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin felt the excitement outside.Luo Shuyu poked his head out: \"It turns out that people don't necessarily have New Year's Eve dinner during the New Year.\"Li Mingjin said: \"Some people start eating New Year's Eve dinner in the afternoon, and they can go shopping with their family at night.\"Luo Shuyu: \" It's so lively, Your Highness, look there is a juggling stall over there.\"Li Mingjin: \"If you want to go and have a look, we can also take a stroll.\"Luo Shuyu's beautiful eyes were shining: \"Really?\"Li Mingjin asked the coachman to park the carriage in the the roadside and then he took Luo Shuyu out of the carriage.The two of them didn't lack anything, so they just walked around and had a look.The main street was very lively, and the two sides of the river were also very lively, with gongs and drums, and people's voices.Luo Shuyu was very curious: \"What's in the front?\"Li Mingjin explained for him, in the past he didn't like to stay in the mansion and he would often come out, so he naturally knew the tricks to play outside: \"There will be a performance at this time of the year, and we can follow along to take a look.\"\"Your Highness, let's stop crowding and take a look from the side.\" Luo Shuyu was worried that there would be accidents due to crowds.One must be cautious in everything nowadays, let alone a crowded place, naturally they couldn\u2019t take it lightly, this was Luo Shuyu's conclusion drawn from the book.Shen Mingyun once hung out with the fourth prince after attending a palace banquet. He excitedly dragged the fourth prince into the crowd. Unexpectedly, they had offended too many people, and some people followed after they came out of the palace. If it wasn't for the guards that the fourth prince brought were capable enough, and there was a master beside him, the corpses of these two people might had been completely chilled.And it wasn't just one time, but several times, Shen Mingyun insisted on leading the fourth prince into the crowd, the assassins figured out the pattern, as long as the two of them squeezed into the crowd, they would start attacking without any hesitation.With these lessons, Luo Shuyu didn't want himself and Li Mingjin to follow Shen Mingyun's old path, learning from others was also a kind of lesson.The two spent some money to choose a restaurant with a higher location. Although it was a bit far away and the view was not as clear as the scene, they still saw it anyway.The performance was still good, and it was said that there was also a dance performance by Liang Xian\u2019er, the number one huakui in the capital.At this time of year, many people gathered here. After the performance, Liang Xian'er would leave in a painted boat.Luo Shuyu was eating the dried fruit that Li Mingjin fed, when suddenly there were noisy and chaotic screams from the river.Li Mingjin immediately sent someone down to ask about the situation.After a while, the movement on the other side of the river subsided, and the officers and soldiers came in time to stop the noise.Ansan came back after inquiring, with a gossip look on his face.Li Mingjin asked him: \"What happened?\"An San said truthfully: \"The fourth prince and Shen Liangshi encountered something over there, and Shen Liangshi seemed to have miscarriage.\"Luo Shuyu stopped chewing the dried fruit: \"Can you tell me again who had miscarriage?\"Ansan described it in more detail this time: \"It was Shen Liangshi from the Fourth Prince's mansion. Somebody suddenly started fighting with the Fourth Prince for some reason. During the fight, Shen Liangshi fell to the ground and was carried to the nearest medical center. I heard the doctor inside said that the child couldn't be kept and he had miscarriage. I also saw the fourth prince looking at him and wiping the tears in the corner of his eyes. \"It was over now!Shen Mingyun completely killed the fourth prince's first child, and the speed was surprisingly fast.Before the palace banquet, he even mentioned to the fourth prince that Shen Mingyun would stay in the mansion for two months, but after only a few days, he couldn't bear the loneliness and ran out to roam around.Li Mingjin couldn't help but sympathize with Li Mingchun: \"The fourth younger brother could almost become a father. How much he expected it before, but now he is so disappointed.\"\"Your Highness is right, Shen Liangshi is too ignorant. They are about to have a baby.\"Li Mingjin said: \"It's really a pity.\"Luo Shuyu nodded: \"If this child would suffer in this world, it's better to be reincarnated.\"After listening to the gossip, the two also felt that the singing and dancing below were meaningless, so they went back home.After washing away the cold, Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu sat on the warm couch to wait the new year.Luo Shuyu knocked on the melon seeds and asked Li Mingjin: \"Your Highness, I heard the first prince mentioned the rumor about the crown prince ten years ago tonight. Do you know what it is?\" Rumors?\"Luo Shuyu's eyes were full of curiosity: \"Well, I see that the crown princ\u2019s face changed tonight.\"Li Mingjin said seriously: \"I'll tell you if I get it tonight.\"Luo Shuyu's ears warmed up: \"Your Highness!\"Li Mingjin kissed him and his voice softened a little: \"Okay, let me say it, this matter has to start before the queen entered the palace...\"The author has something to sayThe Third prince: Wife, you see, I make this thing too deep or not?Luo Shuyu: ...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because his family was not rich, Prime Minister Feng, who was still in the Imperial Academy at the time, liked his intelligence and wisdom, so he let him stay at his mansion.The Feng Mansion back then was as beautiful as it was now, and the current Queen Dowager, that was, the Queen back then, was his own sister.At that time, Feng Hanlin had already paved the way for himself.He had a younger sister who was the queen, so his daughter Feng Shi would also be betrothed to the royal family, this was the bargaining chip for their Feng family.But who would have known that the daughter of the Feng family, who hadn\u2019t out of the boudoir, would make eye contact with the distant relatives who lived in Feng's mansion, and they fell in love with each other.Feng Shi was a lady of the big family. She was raised according to the standards of a royal wife since she was a child. She was proficient in all kinds of piano, chess, calligraphy and painting. She was a talented woman.When she was still young, she had no human experience. When she met someone with similar interests by chance, she often made appointments to write poems and paintings together. Over time, feelings developed.Once the fire of affection was ignited, it was like moths to the flame. No matter what, Feng Shi and his childhood sweetheart had made a private decision for life.It was said that Feng Shi later directly mentioned to Feng Hanlin that she wanted to marry her cousin, and that cousin also expressed that he would propose marriage to Feng's family and marry her.However, Feng Hanlin was furious when he learned of this, not only rejected the other party's request without hesitation, but also drove the cousin out of the Feng mansion.\u00a0He had already arranged for his daughter's next home, how could he give a poor boy a chance, he didn't deserve it!After the two were forced to separate, Feng Shi didn't eat or drink for several days. Later, with her mother's persuasion, she realized that she would never have the right to freely choose the person she liked in her life.This matter happened in Feng's mansion, but it seemed to be a matter of speculation from the outside.The opponents of the Feng family wanted to find the distant cousin who had an affair with Feng Shi back then, but no one could find this person, so it was not known whether this matter was true or not.Some people also tried to bribe the servants of the Feng family, but the mouths of the servants of the Feng family were like clamshells, and they couldn't be pried open.Over time, this incident became a rumor.It was also because of this that the Feng family soon married the crown prince who hadn\u2019t yet proclaimed himself as an emperor, who was now Emperor Tiansheng.The above was just one of the two versions.There was another version that was more exciting than this one.Some people said that when Feng Shi had a marriage contract with the young Emperor Tiansheng, she was with her distant cousin and was discovered by Feng Hanlin, later Feng Hanlin kicked out the cousin who seduced her daughter.\u00a0Half a month after the incident, Feng Shi married into the East Palace, and within two months of marriage, it was discovered that Feng Shi was nearly three months pregnant.\u00a0The child was born in less than nine months.And this second rumor pointed to the crown prince's life experience.After listening to Li Mingjin telling him these two completely different rumors, Luo Shuyu was a little surprised, and then whispered: \"So that's it, this rumor means that the crown prince is not the emperor\u2019s child?\"Li Mingjin was amused by his cautious appearance: \" My dear Yu\u2019er, don't be so nervous, our main courtyard is protected so that not even a mosquito can fly in, and everything we say will not be heard.\"Luo Shuyu said: \"It's not that I just heard about the palace\u2019s secret, I'm a little surprised \"Li Mingjin: \"It's just a rumor, father had rectified it before, and now no one dares to spread it. If the crown prince is not father's own flesh and blood, then how could he become the crown prince.\"This rumor pointed Luo Shuyu in a clear direction. Some things that couldn\u2019t be explained in the previous life now had the answers.He asked Li Mingjin back, and slowly put forward his thoughts: \"Your Highness, have you ever thought about it, what if this rumor is true?\"The reason why the crown prince could become the crown prince was because he had a powerful maternal grandfather and was born of the queen, occupying the title of the heir.He thought that the crown prince fell so quickly in his previous life because Shen Mingyun and the fourth prince teamed up to bring down the prime minister first.There were quite a lot of resentmens and grievances written in the book about Shen Mingyun, the Fourth Prince and the Feng Mansion. First, the first son of the prime minister was injured by a general who supported the Fourth Prince. One leg was rotten, and it would be difficult for him to return to normal in the future, in the end he became a lame man.\u00a0Afterwards, Shen Mingyun had a conflict with the Prime Minister. The restaurant he opened competed with the restaurant with the Feng family's background. The Feng family used their power to oppress Shen Mingyun, making Shen Mingyun unable to open his restaurant. Then Shen Mingyun and the fourth prince retaliated.But thinking about it now, with the ability of the fourth prince at that time and these small conflicts that could be resolved with money on the surface, it was not enough to make a big tree with intertwined roots that had stood in the court for many years fell down, and Emperor Tiansheng must have contributed to this. Perhaps the real mastermind behind the scenes was Emperor Tiansheng who had been aggrieved for many years.The mantis was attacking the cicada, and the oriole was behind.According to Luo Shuyu's knowledge of the crown prince in his previous life, there was no major problem with his conduct, and he was also conscientious in the position of crown prince. If he became the emperor and had the support of the prime minister, there would be basically no major problems in ruling and stabilizing the country.But in the end he was abolished.Perhaps the crown prince's life experience was the root cause he was deposed and the Feng family was destroyed.It was a great crime to confuse the royal blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He slapped his thigh: \"Why do I think what you said makes sense? Now that I think about it carefully, there are many doubtful points about the crown prince.\"Luo Shuyu: \"What are they?\"Li Mingjin: \"Actually, those man-made rumors back then were not groundless. Although our brothers inherited the appearance of our biological mothers, we can see more or less the shadow of father.\u201d\u201c For example, the first brother has a body shape that is very similar to father, and then there is the fourth brother. His face shape is very similar to that of father, and his eyebrows and eyes are very similar to father. On the other hand, the crown prince, it\u2019s true to say that he is somewhat similar to the queen, but he is not completely like her. He is shorter than our brothers, and his appearance is more delicate, and our brothers have wider bones than him.\"Indeed, in terms of body shape, the crown prince was different from the other princes, and the queen herself was quite tall , but the crown prince really didn\u2019t look strong.Luo Shuyu: \"After such analysis, the crown prince is really different from the other princes. If the emperor is sure that he is his own, then the person who spread the rumors would not have been arrested ten years ago.\" Because rumor was stopped with wisdom and collapsed in the light of facts, arresting people could make other suspicious of deception.Li Mingjin: \"Speaking of arresting people, I heard that the queen's momo was gone. When I was a child, I saw that momo who was always with her. The woman even gave me snacks, but I never saw her again.\u201d[\u5b37\u5b37\u00a0m\u00f3 mo: wet nurse]Luo Shuyu: \"Did it happen ten years ago?\"Li Mingjin: \"Maybe she left the palace, or maybe...\" She was secretly executed.Luo Shuyu rubbed his arms: \"Do you think the emperor knows about this?\"Li Mingjin looked at him and said, \"He must know. Without his permission, who would dare to spread rumors in the palace that the crown prince was not of royal blood.\" Maybe he did it on purpose. Because, he deliberately wanted to humiliate the Queen and Prime Minister Feng.Luo Shuyu regretted: \"But in the end he became the crown prince.\"Li Mingjin: \"I suddenly remembered that the Empress Dowager ten years ago hadn't started to worship Buddha. At that time, the prime minister often went to the palace to see her. The Feng family's power was bigger than we imagined. If we confronted them, it might be like a fly shaking a tree. \"Luo Shuyu suddenly said: \"Then there must be the Queen dowager and the Feng family\u2019s hands in this matter.\u201dLi Mingjin: \"That's right, the Feng family's hand is stretched too far. If the crown prince is really not a royal blood, then after he ascends the throne, the world may really change hands.\"Luo Shuyu: \"If so, how can we shake this giant tree?\"On the 30th day, the new year eve, they really gained a lot , Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin would not have discovered any doubts if it hadn't been for the first prince's sudden indiscretion.Li Mingjin: \"Don't worry, let's find out where the servants around the queen have gone, and then we can speculate.\"Luo Shuyu shook Li Mingjin's arm: \"The most important thing is to confirm that 'cousin' is dead or alive?\"Prime Minister Feng sent his daughter and granddaughter to the palace, and he already had power over the world. A person like him must have a plan for his family, and those who destroyed his family status would definitely be dealt with. If the queen really had a scandalous past with her childhood sweetheart, Prime Minister Feng would definitely deal with him cleanly.Maybe there really wouldn't be any survivors.Unclearness flashed in Li Mingjin's eyes, not only his sons but also his courtiers were coveting his father's position.This palace was really a battle between dragons and tigers, surrounded by wolves.Guessing that the crown prince's life experience was not easy, Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu didn\u2019t make it public, but quietly sent people to investigate.This investigation would take some time, but now it was the New Year period, and it was time to relax. It was also feasible to send people to set up a routine. There would always be breakthroughs, such as the eldest brother of the crown princess, the eldest brother-in-law of the crown prince, and a son who ran to Huancai Pavilion if he had nothing to do.This Young Master Feng had no other skills, but he was the best for drinking and visiting brothels. This man had a particularly interesting problem when he was drunk, that was, when others asked him a question, he would answer it.Li Mingjin sent someone to approach him, and he really got a lot of useful information. Although he couldn't know too much about the queen's affairs back then, he could ask some details. As long as he could connect with the rumors, he would know almost everything.He thought it would be difficult to make progress in the investigation of the matter, but in fact, after sending people to investigate, it was actually almost close to the truth.When Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu found out, it was already the fifth day of the new year.Things had to be investigated, and the year had to pass.Today, Li Mingjin was hosting a banquet for his colleagues in the Ministry of Justice who usually took care of him a lot in the Ministry of Justice.Even though Li Mingjin came to the Ministry of Justice with a gloomy face everyday, but it was not right to say that he had never done any work, at least his colleagues recognized him, otherwise they would not come to his mansion to pay New Year's greetings.Luo Shuyu was quite happy to see them, and he was not ignorant of Li Mingjin's reputation outside, but when the officials who usually worked with him were willing to come to the door, he still felt that Li Mingjin was quite down-to-earth.At least, during the time he was in the Ministry of Justice, the officials didn\u2019t treat him too coldly or perfunctorily because of the external evaluations.Luo Shuyu arranged for the kitchen to cook delicious food and received them together with Li Mingjin, which was regarded as respect for the officials of the Ministry of Justice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No wonder the pointed chin of His Highness became much rounder after he got married, and I feel that he is not as cold as before, and he even discussed with me how to celebrate his wife\u2019s birthday.\u201d\u201cHe also asked me.\u201d\u201cIt seems in the future we can\u2019t look at the surface only.\u201d\u201cIt makes sense.\u201dFirst, Li Mingjin\u2019s colleagues, the officials of Ministry of Justice came to the mansion to pay New Year's greetings, and then Lin Haiming came with a wave of generals. Luo Shuyu suddenly found that Li Mingjin's popularity was quite good. This time Luo Shuyu learned a lesson from his previous life and prepared a lamb for them in advance, they ate roasted whole lamb while drinking.Drinking in a big bowl, eating meat in big mouthfuls, happy like a fairy.Lin Haiming kept calling him sister-in-law and insisted on toasting him. Luo Shuyu also drank two glasses with him. In the end, Li Mingjin stared at him, so Lin Haiming didn't dare to continue making trouble.Luo Shuyu wanted to maintain the dignity of the imperial concubine, and left a space for them after they were full. Fearing that they wouldn't have enough to drink, so he asked someone to bring some good wine from the wine cellar for preparation, ordered the chef to make some hangover soup for them, and prepared a few rooms in advance.Compared with the officials of the Ministry of Justice, the military generals were much more interesting. With Lin Haiming in the middle to mediate, the atmosphere was very good all night.The roasted mutton was also very delicious. Luo Shuyu was afraid that they wouldn\u2019t have enough to eat, so he asked the back kitchen to add more appetizers, trying to make the guests feel at home.These generals would go to the north with Li Mingjin in a few days, so naturally they had to greet them well.However, there were also some generals who didn\u2019t come, and those people were basically related to the crown prince or the first prince, and those generals were placed inside by the two of them.But no matter what they did, as long as most people stood on Li Mingjin's side, they were not afraid that they wouldn\u2019t be convinced. According to Ansan, Li Mingjin's martial arts were also ranked in the top three among the generals, the literary was the first and martial art was the second. Learning to communicate with them was the first step to success.When it came to New Year's greetings, Luo Shuyu would not forget to pay New Year's greeting to Luo Mansion.Originally, he was supposed to go back to his natal family on the second day of the new year, but he belonged to the third prince after all, they hadn\u2019t finished to pay New Year's greetings to the people in the palace, so the others could only stay behind.Luo Renshou looked left and right, and finally on the seventh day of the New Year, he finally met Luo Shuyu.On the same day, Shen Mingyun also sent someone to send a carload of gifts back to Luo Mansion. Everyone knew about his miscarriage. When Luo Renshou greeted Luo Shuyu, he didn't mention Shen Mingyun at all.Li Mingjin had to go to the palace beforehand, while Luo Shuyu had lunch at the Luo Mansion, accompanied by the old lady, Luo Renshou and others.After lunch, the old lady went back to her courtyard first.Luo Shuyu and Luo Renshou were drinking tea in the living room, and he talked about Shen Mingyun generously: \"Father, Cousin Shen has no other relatives, and his body was injured on the night of New Year's Eve, and he doesn't know how to take care of himself. It's better to send someone to look after him, after all he belongs to the fourth prince.\"He put the words on the bright side, Luo Renshou naturally didn\u2019t dare to mention that he got close to the fourth prince because of Shen Mingyun.The fourth prince had become more promising recently than before, but Shen Mingyun was too disappointing, he couldn't even keep a child!At the beginning, Luo Renshou was indeed angry at the fact that Shen Mingyun being quietly carried into the fourth prince's mansion. Later, the fourth prince had a drink with him and did his ideological work, so Luo Renshou began to waver again. He had always been neutral, now he didn\u2019t dare to get close to any prince casually.His son married the third prince, and his nephew entered the fourth prince's mansion. No matter how you looked at it, he was a winner in life. Only he knew that he was forced to disagree with both sides.But recently the fourth prince got close to him, and treated him so well, he almost regarded him as a serious father-in-law. On the other hand, the third prince, when he saw him, he (LMJ) raised his eyebrows. He didn't have the slightest sense of pride in being regarded as a father-in-law. With the comparison, he felt that the fourth prince was really good. Were you still angry about Shen Mingyun entering the fourth prince's mansion? Impossible.Luo Renshou said with great regret: \"Ming Yun is also true. Wouldn't it be good to stay at home and take care of his unborn child? It's not easy to conceive a child, hey.\"\"Maybe the fate hasn't arrived yet.\" Luo Shuyu dealt with it casually.Luo Renshou suddenly said softly: \"I heard that General Zhenbei returned to the capital on the second day of the New Year, and the Third prince is about to go to the north.\"Luo Shuyu said sadly: \"Yes, he is going to go to the north.\" Really heartfelt.Luo Renshou acted as a loving father: \"Your Majesty will definitely keep General Zhenbei in the capital. It will take some time for His Highness the Third prince to go. What should you do?\"Luo Shuyu pretended to be strong and said: \"He went to the north, I'm in the Third Prince\u2019s mansion, it's not a big deal.\"Luo Renshou was secretly happy, Li Mingjin was not in the capital, Luo Shuyu would have to rely on him in the future.Before it snowed, Luo Shuyu left Luo Mansion. Sitting in the carriage, remembering that Li Mingjin would leave the capital, and he felt extremely reluctant in his heart.At the same time, Li Mingjin was sitting and playing wuziqi with Emperor Tiansheng.[\u4e94\u5b50\u68cb\u00a0w\u01d4 z\u01d0 q\u00ed: five-in-a-row (game similar to tic-tac-toe); Japanese: gomoku; gobang]In the middle of the game, Li Mingjin, who was obsessed with chess pieces, suddenly said: \"Father, you were not conscientious. The son has just been married for four months and he will go to the north.\"Emperor Tiansheng laughed angrily at him: \"So? What do you want?\"Maybe During this period of time, Emperor Tiansheng got some feeling of being a father from Li Mingjin, and he showed tolerance to Li Mingjin's complaints, and wanted to pamper him more.Li Mingjin said confidently: \"I want to take Shuyu to the north together.\"Emperor Tiansheng: \"...\"The author has something to say:The Third Prince: Wife, in the wilderness, guess what I thought of?Luo Shuyu: A ghost story?Third Prince: No, it's you and me on the grass.Luo Shuyu: ...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, he is your imperial concubine, who dares to bully him? Besides, your wife is not a submissive person who doesn't know how to resist, he is very smart.\u201dLi Mingjin insisted: \"But no matter how smart he is, I still want to take him to the north.\"Emperor Tiansheng also insisted on his decision: \"No, it's freezing, if something happens on the way, do you not feel distressed?\"Li Mingjin believed in himself: \"With me here, how can something happen to him.\" If he was here there was not enough time to protect him.Emperor Tiansheng: \"If I say no, I won't do it. Although you are not allowed to go to the front to fight, but you can't take him there. There is no need to discuss it.\"Li Mingjin was so angry with Emperor Tiansheng that he didn't want to talk, he thought about whether he should secretly take Luo Shuyu away.Emperor Tiansheng reminded him: \"Don't give me such a thing like secretly taking people away, you are the prince of a country and you are not allowed to make fun of this.\"Li Mingjin had no choice but to play chess with him, Emperor Tiansheng was also very helpless, there were many considerations in rejecting Li Mingjin's request.The first was the climate in the north; the second was that Li Mingjin was still too young, and this decision was still too capricious. When he took Luo Shuyu there, he was afraid that he would be criticized.After dinner with Emperor Tiansheng, Li Mingjin didn't get the expected answer, so he left the palace dejectedly.On the way back home, Ansan asked Li Mingjin secretly: \"Your Highness, is there nothing you can do?\"Li Mingjin said distraughtly: \"Why don't you give me an idea.\"Ansan immediately admitted his mistake: \"This subordinate is a little stupid, can't figure it out, why don't you secretly take the third imperial concubine to the north?\"The Third Prince entered the palace today to beg His Majesty, It was estimated that he had done a long time of psychological construction, but His Majesty just disagreed, and the only way he could think of was to take people away secretly.Li Mingjin got on his horse and said, \"Go home first, and then think of other ways.\"Luo Shuyu didn't know anything about Li Mingjin running to the palace to ask Emperor Tiansheng for the order to take him to the north.The sky was gloomy, and it was about to snow. After Luo Shuyu returned to the Third Prince\u2019s mansion, he waited for a long time, but Li Mingjin didn\u2019t come back.He didn't know where he went, he was so mysterious.It was rare that there was no banquet today, and they didn\u2019t need to go to the palace to accompany the people in the palace to have dinner, so Luo Shuyu asked the kitchen to make the dinner lighter.In recent days, there had been a lot of fish and meat, and Li Mingjin's stomach needed to be well adjusted.Just after giving orders to the kitchen, the people who served Li Mingjin came back and reported that Emperor Tiansheng had him stayed to eat in the palace, so he wouldn\u2019t come back for dinner, and he would return to the mansion later.Only then did Luo Shuyu know that he had gone to the palace.What did he need to let him go into the palace?\u00a0Emperor Tiansheng secretly sent someone to tell him to go in?\u00a0What was it?After having dinner alone, Luo Shuyu wore a fur coat and waited for Li Mingjin to come back.The sky gradually darkened, and the mansion began to light the lamps.After a while, it began to snow.Luo Shuyu sent someone to take Li Mingjin's fur clothes and wait at the gate of the mansion, as long as he couldn't see anyone, he would be particularly worried.Probably because the shadow of his previous life was too heavy, he was afraid of losing Li Mingjin again, so he couldn't help worrying.Fortunately, he went to the palace. Emperor Tiansheng had a completely different attitude towards Li Mingjin recently. Although it was easy to push Li Mingjin to the forefront, he was not afraid of being attacked by other brothers. He would go to the north soon, and other brothers could only go to the north if they wanted to attack him.Li Mingjin had no handle except him.If this was the case, then when he was in the north, he who stayed in the capital could\u2019t hold him back, otherwise Li Mingjin would still worry about whether he was doing well and whether he would be bullied.However, Li Mingjin hadn't set off yet, and he was starting to worry. If Li Mingjin had to stay for a year or two, he was afraid that he might can\u2019t help it but secretly went to the north to find someone.After his rebirth, he just wanted to live an ordinary life with the person he loved, without fighting, why was it so difficult?He didn't want Li Mingjin to go to the north, didn't want to be separated from him, and didn't want to hear nothing from him for ten days and a half months.He wanted to see Li Mingjin who was intact, he wanted to see Li Mingjin who was happy, angry, and sad, and he wanted to have him by his side every night.Luo Shuyu lay on the small table and fiddled with the chess pieces, the more he thought about it, the more sad he became, and angrily threw the chess pieces back into the chess jar.Why was there no way to satisfy rival demands?[\u4e24\u5168\u5176\u7f8e\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 li\u01ceng qu\u00e1n q\u00ed m\u011bi: to satisfy rival demands (idiom); to get the best of both worlds; to have it both ways; to have one's cake and eat it too]No, he couldn't just sit and wait, tomorrow he would go to the palace and ask Emperor Tiansheng to let him follow Li Mingjin to the north, wherever Li Mingjin was, he would be there!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was not his original intention!With a solution, Luo Shuyu began to think about how to persuade Emperor Tiansheng to let him go to the north with Li Mingjin.There was a movement outside. It was Li Mingjin who came back. Luo Shuyu got off the couch and rushed out casually with his shoes on.As soon as Li Mingjin entered the door, he received Luo Shuyu who threw himself into his arms. Seeing his red eyes, he felt agitated in his heart: \"Who bullied you?\"Luo Shuyu shook his head: \"No, I read a story book, and I was moved by the life and death of the hero and heroine.\"Li Mingjin pushed him away a little: \"I\u2019m cold, and you will catch cold easily if you lean on me.\"Luo Shuyu didn't mind, he still wanted to hug him.Li Mingjin felt that Luo Shuyu was a bit clingy today, but he was very happy: \"I won't run away, and you can hug me as long as you want later.\"Luo Shuyu knew that he was not serious, so he didn't hug him anymore, and he simply asked the servant to prepare hot water for him to take a bath.It was cold at night, and the two of them went to bed early.Li Mingjin was a big natural heater, Luo Shuyu took the initiative to drill into his arms.It was night time.\"Why did Your Highness enter the palace today? Was father looking for you for something important?\"Li Mingjin became angry when he mentioned this matter, but he wouldn\u2019t tell Luo Shuyu that his request was rejected by Emperor Tiansheng, for fear that he would think too much, and if he succeeded, he would happily tell him that the main reason was that the matter hadn\u2019t been completed, and talking about it would only turn expectations into disappointment.Li Mingjin: \"It's nothing serious, he only asked me when the affairs of Princess Jiayang and his group would be closed.\"Luo Shuyu obviously didn't quite believe his words: \"Really?\"Emperor Tiansheng, when people still celebrated the New Year, asked him to discuss this matter?\u00a0It was not very credible, he guessed that Li Mingjin had a reason that he couldn't explain clearly for the time being, or he was doing some tricks behind his back, what exactly they talked about?Li Mingjin said very sincerely: \"Really.\"In the end Luo Shuyu didn't go to the bottom of things, he himself also had some plans in his heart: \"I have to go to the palace tomorrow to talk to mother concubine. It's boring for her to spend the New Year in the palace alone.\"Li Mingjin: \"Okay, help me bring some meals for mother concubine. I'll pick you up at the gate of the palace after lunch.\"The two went to see her on the second day of the new year. In order to maintain the appearance of a bad relationship between mother and son, Li Mingjin wouldn\u2019t accompany Luo Shuyu tomorrow.Luo Shuyu thoughtfully said: \"Your Highness, you don't have to come too early, this day is too cold, and it's easy to catch cold if you stand outside.\"Li Mingjin began to grope restlessly with his hands: \"I am strong and robust, how can I be so fragile, does Yu'er want to verify it?\"Luo Shuyu: \"...No!\" could he change his bed?Li Mingjin pulled up the quilt to wrap him, and pressed his down: \"It's too late!\"Luo Shuyu's lips were blocked: \"... oh!\"After one night, Luo Shuyu pressed his sore waist, and Li Mingjin just got up, when he saw Luo Shuyu rubbed his waist, he pulled him into his arms and rubbed his waist with his palm.Li Mingjin asked him: \"Is the strength enough?\"Luo Shuyu put his hands on the most sore part of his waist: \"A little more, did I twist my waist, why did I feel sore and swollen?\"Li Mingjin: \"I will massage it for you for a while.\"Luo Shuyu enjoyed his massage and said, \"Your Highness must be honest in everything you say tonight, or you will sleep on the small couch for three days.\"Li Mingjin: \"...\" He just tried a new movement last night, and his wife was too serious, \"If it still hurts, I'll invite an imperial doctor to come to take a look at it in the afternoon.\"Luo Shuyu yawned: \"It's okay, it might get pulled a bit, it will be fine in two days.\"Li Mingjin: \"You lack exercise, why don't you follow me to practice martial arts for a few days? You don't need to go out, you can do it indoors.\"Luo Shuyu: \"No practice.\" It could be done indoors, who knew if Li Mingjin was not serious again.Li Mingjin continued to rub his waist: \"It\u2019s true, just a few movements, not the ones we did at night, your thoughts are really impure.\"Luo Shuyu elbowed him: \"Who is impure?\" If it wasn't for him who liked to do this and that with him all day long, could he think of it as a real physical exercise?Li Mingjin smiled depressedly: \"It's me, it's me. If you don't want to practice, let's not practice.\"\"Practice, why I don't want to practice?\" Only after he had practiced, he could go to the north without holding Li Mingjin back, \"If I hadn't passed the best age for learning martial arts, I still want to practice martial arts.\"Li Mingjin was frightened by him: \"Yu\u2019er, we have hidden guards, so you don't need to practice martial arts yourself, as long as you are healthy.\"Luo Shuyu suddenly became stubborn: \"No, I want to practice. \"Li Mingjin coaxed him: \"It's really not necessary.\"Luo Shuyu began to be willful: \"I want it.\"Li Mingjin: \"It's really not necessary, I will protect you.\"Luo Shuyu said: \"You can't be by my side to protect me all the time. In order not to let you worry, I have to learn martial arts.\"Li Mingjin finally knew that this was a symptom that appeared because he was going to go to the north: \"I'll find a solution.\"In the end Luo Shuyu didn\u2019t get the result of whether or not to practice martial arts, and he entered the palace after breakfast.But instead of looking for Concubine Mei, he went directly to see Emperor Tiansheng.Emperor Tiansheng was in his bedroom yesterday and didn't go anywhere, Luo Shuyu could see him without any effort.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

According to the past, when the Crown Princess and the First imperial Concubine begged him alone, it was mostly for their natal family.Luo Shuyu pursed his lips, his eyes were a little red, he felt a little wronged, but his eyes were firm: \"To tell the truth to father, Shuyu lost his mother since he was a child. I thought that after marrying His Highness, I was afraid that I wouldn\u2019t be able to communicate with His Highness because of my character. I would only live a life as ordinary as water.\u201d\u201cBut after getting along with His Highness, I found that His Highness is different from what the outside world said about him. After getting along for a long time, I liked His Highness and wanted to manage our small family together with His Highness. Hearing that His Highness was about to go to the north,\u00a0\u00a0I thought it was nothing, this was an errand given to him by father, His Highness must do it well, and I thought that I would wait at home obediently for him to return in triumph.\u201d\u201cHowever, when the day for His Highness to depart is getting closer, the more uncomfortable I\u2019m, I don\u2019t know if he will do well after he go to the north? will he be short of food and clothing? I don\u2019t know if he is cold or hot. The more I think about it, the more uncomfortable I feel. After thinking about it for many days, today I summoned up the courage to ask father for a favor, please allow me to accompany His Highness to go to the north!\u201dWhen Emperor Tiansheng heard Li Mingjin wanted to bring Luo Shuyu to go to the north with him yesterday, his words were short and it sounded like a willful nonsense, so he refused without hesitation.On the other hand, Luo Shuyu's request today was sincere, and every sentence was from the heart. Compared with Li Mingjin's concise and straightforward words, Luo Shuyu's language skills were very contagious, and Emperor Tiansheng was moved by what he said.Yesterday he was not at all willing to let Luo Shuyu go to the north with Li Mingjin, but today he was almost persuaded.Emperor Tiansheng sold Li Mingjin without hesitation: \"The two of you are one after the other, did the two of you come to an agreement?\"Luo Shuyu understood everything, and said in surprise, \"His Highness entered the palace yesterday...\"Emperor Tiansheng: \"That's right, the two of you, aren't you embarrassing me? Didn't you ask for trouble when you want to follow him to the north to suffer from the cold? Wouldn't it be nice to be comfortable in the capital? everything that should be here is here.\"[\u5e94\u6709\u5c3d\u6709\u00a0y\u012bng y\u01d2u j\u00ecn y\u01d2u: everything that should be here is here (idiom); all one can think of is on hand; to have all one needs]Luo Shuyu: \"But, Shuyu is worried that His Highness is not doing well in the north, if he can be together with His Highness, it\u2019s okay to suffer a little bit. Father, Taizu was also accompanied by his wife when he went out to fight. I also want to be close to His Highness and become his backing and help him take care of trivial matters. \"[\u592a\u7956\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0t\u00e0i z\u01d4: Great Ancestor (posthumous title, e.g. for the founder of a dynasty)]\"Taizu, I really remember when you said that.\" Emperor Tiansheng asked him again, \"Are you really not afraid of hardship?\"Luo Shuyu said sincerely: \"Don't dare to lie to father, compared with the soldiers outside, Shuyu really doesn\u2019't have a hard life, but Shuyu is not afraid of hardship.\u201dEmperor Tiansheng smiled: \"Let me think about this matter again. I really don't know what the two of you think. Others want to live a comfortable life, but you are all rushing to live a hard life.\"Luo Shuyu achieved his goal and thanked Emperor Tiansheng: \"Thank you, father.\"However, he really couldn\u2019t guess that the reason Li Mingjin entered the palace yesterday in order to take him to the north, no wonder he didn't say anything, probably because he was rejected by Emperor Tiansheng.Before leaving the palace, Luo Shuyu went to sit with Concubine Mei for a while, and he mentioned to her that he wanted to go to the north with Li Mingjin.Concubine Mei: \"You want to go too?\"Luo Shuyu: \"Yes, mother concubine, I have never left the capital, the same is true for His Highness, I want to take care of him closely, instead of staying in the capital and waiting for his reply every day. \"Concubine Mei looked at him firmly, and said decisively: \"Go, I will speak for you in front of His Majesty.\"Luo Shuyu was quite surprised, he didn\u2019t expect Concubine Mei to be so forthright, he smiled and said: \"Thank you, mother concubine.\u201dAfter leaving the palace, he saw Li Mingjin who was waiting for him at the gate.Luo Shuyu was in a good mood, and went to hold his hand: \"Your Highness.\"As soon as he stepped forward, he smelled a strange smell: \"What's the smell on you?\"Li Mingjin took two steps back, lowered his head and sniffed his sleeve : \"Do I smell bad?\"Luo Shuyu nodded and pinched his nose: \"It stinks, what did you do?\"Li Mingjin looked left and right: \"... I just ate something.\"Luo Shuyu squinted at him: \"Did Your Highness eat the food from the stall again?\"Li Mingjin pursed his lips and didn\u2019t answer.Luo Shuyu glared at Ansan who was dressed as an ordinary guard, \"If he doesn't say it, you say it.\"Without hesitation Ansan said: \"His Highness ate thirty pieces of stinky tofu!\" The salary must be kept!Luo Shuyu glared at the two of them: \"Your Highness will eat vegetarian tonight, and Ansan will withhold half a month's salary.\"Li Mingjin: \"...\" Ansan was a traitor!The author has something to say:The Third Prince: Wife, isn\u2019t it particularly delicious?Luo Shuyu: ...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He just had a natural curiosity about food, maybe it was just a self-compensation for the missing childhood. He didn't eat it before because he didn't meet someone who would pamper him, love him, and someone he could trust, and now he could rest assured.Li Mingjin not only liked to try something new, but also preferred strange food, such as this stinky tofu, or the fried durian before.Luo Shuyu would rather have him eat roasted sweet potatoes and roasted pig's trotters, at least the ingredients could be seen, but this stinky tofu, he didn't know what it was made of, it was really made him worry.Luo Shuyu didn't tell Li Mingjin about him entering the palace to meet Emperor Tiansheng, but when he thought that Li Mingjin was very reluctant to give up on him, and even begged in front of Emperor Tiansheng in person, he didn't care about him who ate the snacks indiscriminately, and he pretended to be angry for a while and then he didn\u2019t mind.He only hoped that Concubine Mei could let Emperor Tiansheng make a decision as soon as possible, so that he could pack his luggage for going to the north in advance.In fact, when he came out of Emperor Tiansheng's palace today, he knew that Emperor Tiansheng was shaken, and he didn't reject him directly, it was a good thing when he thought about it.As for the reason why Emperor Tiansheng rejected Li Mingjin's request directly in the first place, it must be because Li Mingjin didn't speak well. Luo Shuyu could imagine the tone he used to make a request to Emperor Tiansheng.\u00a0However, with Li Mingjin\u2019s character, he would definitely play the emotional card.According to the subtle \"father-son\" affection that Emperor Tiansheng had for Li Mingjin, he guessed that Emperor Tiansheng would also like someone to take care of Li Mingjin, let alone he mentioned taizu and his wife, and if he disagreed, it would be unreasonable.\u00a0When Concubine Mei also went to see Emperor Tiansheng, this matter became a \"family\" discussion, and the family affection that Emperor Tiansheng wanted recently was fulfilled.Although it was Luo Shuyu's impromptu plan, it could also be called a step-by-step plan.His purpose to go to the north was only to take care of Li Mingjin, not to disturb the morale of the army, and he did not do anything to cause cholera to the common people.There was one more thing that Emperor Tiansheng must consider, and that was Li Mingjin's condition. What should he do if he got sick?Luo Shuyu wanted to go to the north, and he also wanted to find \"Jie Baidu\". When reading a book, there was only text descriptions, unlike reading a picture book with rich pictures and texts, and he could see the characteristics of the characters. He only remembered that in the book this \"Jie Baidu\" was an old man who was a bit sloppy. At first glance, he looked like an ordinary villager. No one would know that he had medical skills unless he said it.This person devoted his whole life to taste all kinds of herbs and find the antidote of all kinds of poisons. He didn\u2019t really care about other aspects and his mind was relatively simple, otherwise he wouldn't be deceived by Shen Mingyun's ordinary pills.When Li Mingjin was still troubled by the matter of Luo Shuyu who couldn\u2019t \u00a0go to the north with him, Concubine Mei, who hadn't left Changle Palace for a long time went to see Emperor Tiansheng.For a while, rumors spread throughout the harem that Concubine Mei went to meet Emperor Tiansheng and wanted to regain favor, but after they inquired about the reason why Concubine Mei begged to meet Emperor Shengtian, they were speechless, unable to understand Concubine Mei's intentions. It was the first time they saw someone who drove her daughter-in-law to that bitter cold place, she was simply a model of a wicked mother-in-law.It was not a day or two for the women in the harem trying to figure out this matter when they had nothing to do.Some people said that Concubine Mei was not only cold-blooded and ruthless to her son, but also to her daughter-in-law; some people said that Concubine Mei was planning some kind of conspiracy. Her daughter-in-law must go to the north with the third prince because she was thinking to let her daughter in law to give birth to a grandson as soon as possible.She never fought or grabbed for something, but in fact she was the one with the biggest ambition and the deepest scheming in the palace; some people said that Concubine Mei started to fight for favor for the third prince.The harem was also a place of right and wrong, and there were different opinions.On the contrary, Concubine Mei just shook her head when she learned about it from the palace maid, and then continued to grow Chinese cabbage and eggplant in her Changle Palace, and sent part of the vegetables to the Third Prince's mansion.Everyone in the palace knew that Concubine Mei was looking for Emperor Tiansheng, so Li Mingjin naturally knew about it too.Only one day later, Emperor Tiansheng summoned the couple into the palace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who asked Li Mingjin to enter the palace the day before yesterday and didn\u2019t tell him the reason for looking the Emperor Tiansheng. He obviously wanted that he could go to the north with him, but he still didn't say anything. A small punishment was still necessary.Until they stood in front of Emperor Tiansheng, Li Mingjin still couldn\u2019t find out from Luo Shuyu about the purpose of his entering the palace yesterday, which made him anxious.Concubine Lin came here just now, and she was pleading for leniency for her natal family. Emperor Tiansheng was really annoyed by her. But when he saw that the husband and wife were in a good mood, they were in good spirits, and the young couple also looked very affectionate, he felt more comfortable.Emperor Tiansheng called the two of them to the palace where he usually lived: \"Sit down, you two are still being polite to me here. \"Li Mingjin sat down and he pulled Luo Shuyu to sit down too.Emperor Tiansheng laughed and said: \"You child, yesterday, Concubine Mei came to me to intercede on your behalf, and it was the matter about Shuyu goes to the north.\"Li Mingjin turned to look at Luo Shuyu: \"Why didn't you tell me?\"\"Then Your Highness also didn't tell me that you want me to go to the north.\" Luo Shuyu showed a little temper, and glanced at him, \"was it because father didn't agree?\"Li Mingjin rubbed his nose, looked at Emperor Tiansheng again, and said eagerly, \"Father asked us to enter the palace today, is it because you agree?\"Emperor Tiansheng took a look at his henpecked husband, and pointed to him: \"You are the only one who is smart.\"Li Mingjin's eyes lit up: \"Really?\"Emperor Tiansheng sighed: \"If I still disagree, what will you do?\"Li Mingjin said bluntly: \"I have no choice but to take Shuyu away quietly.\"Emperor Tiansheng said with a helpless smile: \"Yesterday, Shuyu's remark really moved me. Since ancient times, the man sings and the woman follows, so there is nothing wrong with him following. Alright, I agree, you can go together, remember to put your own safety first in everything on the way, and write letter to me regularly when you arrive in the north to report your safety. \"[\u592b\u5531\u5987\u968f\u00a0f\u016b ch\u00e0ng f\u00f9 su\u00ed: fig.\u00a0\u592b\u5531\u5987\u968f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 f\u016b ch\u00e0ng f\u00f9 su\u00ed\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fig. the man sings and the woman follows; fig. marital harmony; fig. marital harmony]Li Mingjin agreed immediately: \"The son will \"Luo Shuyu also said happily: \"Father, Shuyu will definitely keep an eye on His Highness and write letter to you.\"Coaxing Emperor Tiansheng to agree to their request, and didn\u2019t let him go back on his words.Most of the emperors kept their promises, and they believed that Emperor Tiansheng would not go back on his words.For now, he still looked at Li Mingjin with a \"father-son feeling\", and when they could still take advantage of this, let's make good use of it.Luo Shuyu got the chance to go to the north with Li Mingjin, so naturally they had to have lunch with Emperor Tiansheng.This time Li Mingjin was obviously happier, and had an extra bowl of rice in front of Emperor Tiansheng. The unhappiness caused by Concubine Lin disappeared, and he felt more and more that he owed to the third child, and wanted to give him more, so he gave him something for self-protection.After lunch, the three of them drank green tea together to digest food. When Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu were about to leave the palace, Emperor Tiansheng asked the old eunuch who was in charge to go to his storeroom to get a twenty-four knots iron whip that once used by Taizu.Li Mingjin loved it too much to part with it, and even tried it outside the palace on the spot, and performed a set of whipping techniques for Emperor Tiansheng.[\u7231\u4e0d\u91ca\u624b\u00a0\u00e0i b\u00f9 sh\u00ec sh\u01d2u: to love sth too much to part with it (idiom); to fondle admiringly]Emperor Tiansheng sighed: \"If you want to talk about the ability to play with the whip, no one dares to be the number one when Mingjin is the second.\"Luo Shuyu also watched straight at his performance, it was the first time he saw Li Mingjin whipping the whip perfectly, as if the whip was tailor-made for him.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin left the palace after satisfying Emperor Tiansheng's need for father-son love.On the way back, they held each other's hands tightly, and only after returning to the mansion did they really breathe a sigh of relief.Only then did Li Mingjin say to Luo Shuyu: \"Yu'er, you go to the north with me. Although there will be some twists and turns on the way, and it's freezing cold, I will do my best to protect you.\"Luo Shuyu shook his head: \"\u00a0Your Highness, don't worry about me. It\u2019s also my wish to go to the north with you. I don't want to be separated from you, not even for a moment. \"Li Mingjin was very excited, he thought it was his own wishful thinking before, but Luo Shuyu also secretly worked hard to go to the north with him. Perhaps it was because of his initiative that facilitated them to go to the north together.Li Mingjin: \"I don't want to say goodbye to you either, so we can make good preparations for going to the north now.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Yes, while there is still time to prepare, let's make a list first. Is there anything that Your Highness wants to bring?\"Li Mingjin: \"One person writes a copy first, and then we will discuss what to bring.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He heard that there was a shortage of everything in the north, not even tea leaves.As for Li Mingjin, he just stared at Luo Shuyu who was thinking about somthing while sitting on the chair, and wrote down repeated words on the paper.When Luo Shuyu walked over with three pages of paper, he saw the words written by Li Mingjin on the paper, all of which were his name!Luo Shuyu was a little helpless: \"Your Highness, be more serious.\"Li Mingjin: \"This is the only one I want to bring, he is my treasure, the treasure that passes on through the generations.\"Luo Shuyu: \"You are not serious, I will let the housekeeper to prepare it.\"Li Mingjin said resolutely: \"I'm being serious.\"Luo Shuyu: \"I asked you to write the things you want to bring, all you wrote was my name, and you still wasted the paper.\"Li Mingjin: \"I didn't waste it, our Yu'er is really a priceless treasure.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Did Your Highness put honey on you mouth today? It's so sweet.\"Li Mingjin pecked his lips: \"Would you like to try it?\"Luo Shuyu pushed him away, and pressed his own papers on his face: \"I don\u2019t care about you, well, you think about it yourself!\"After finished speaking, Luo Shuyu left the study room and went to the main courtyard. He asked housekeeper Sun to come over and prepare the things they needed for their long journey. Not only did they need to bring a lot of things, but also some servants, which was equivalent to move the whole family, even though there were only two of them in this family.At the beginning, Luo Shuyu also prepared some clothes, dried meat, wine and other things for Li Mingjin to go to the north. He didn't expect Emperor Tiansheng to be so easy to talk, and he directly agreed with him to go to the north.They were still different from Shen Mingyun and the fourth prince going to the north in the book.The time the two going to the north was a bit earlier, and they might have to stay in the north longer than Shen Mingyun and the fourth prince did. Shen Mingyun had encounter with Jiebaidu but it didn't mean that he was as lucky as Shen Mingyun, but he still had to find someone for Li Mingjin on a down-to-earth basis.\"Jiebaidu\", in addition to his love of tasting herbs and making antidote for poison, he also had another hobby, which was to collect good wine.So he needed to prepare some special wine.With a goal in mind, Luo Shuyu immediately asked the housekeeper to go to the capital to find a variety of good wines with different tastes, no need to bring too many, but they must be high quality.Li Mingjin carefully read his list and asked him why he wanted so many kinds of good wines. Shouldn\u2019t he bring more wines? There were so many types but small quantity, it was not enough to drink. The generals drank wit the bowl, how could these small jars be enough for them.Luo Shuyu reminded him: \"Your Highness, don't ever think about these wines of mine, it\u2019s useful.\"Li Mingjin dispersed his thinking: \"Do you want to go to the north to sell wine?\"Luo Shuyu: \"What is Your Highness thinking, of course not, wait until the day they will play a role, you will know, and you are not allowed to drink them, got it?.\"Li Mingjin: \"Allright, all these wines are not enough to quench my thirst.\"Luo Shuyu: \"Your Highness, drink less alcohol. I heard people say that men who drink too much alcohol will become potbellied when they are in their thirties, which is ugly.Li Mingjin: \"You despise me when I'm old?\"Luo Shuyu: \"Yes, middle-aged handsome men are the one I like. Does Your Highness want to become ugly?At that time, Your Highness may not even be able to bend over.\"Li Mingjin imagined the character Luo Shuyu described and he was a little frightened: \"It's a bit ugly, it looks like Xian Wang next door, He goes out with his big stomach all day long, watching him I always feel uncomfortable, so I'd better listen to you and drink less in the future.\u201d[\u8d24\u738b\u00a0xi\u00e1n w\u00e1ng: sage kings]Luo Shuyu said in his heart that His Highness was quite easy to talk to: \u201cNot bad\u201dThe wine was a must-have thing and maybe he should prepare more, Luo Shuyu thought of Concubine Mei, \"By the way, Your Highness, the climate in the north is dry, it\u2019s not easy to grow rice and what we eat is wheat. Should we ask Concubine Mother some useful seeds? If they can be planted in the spring, it can also solve the problem of food and clothing for the people in the winter. \"Li Mingjin thought a lot: \"It may not be so comprehensive to ask the concubine mother, or I will ask father to bring some people who know farming, there must be father\u2019s people who will go to the north with us, so just ask him directly.\"Luo Shuyu recalled the details about this paragraph in the book. Because Shen Mingyun had the system, he knew in advance that the north might lack food due to the war, so he asked the fourth prince to bring many drought resistant seeds when he went to the north. Not only solved the problem of the army's rations, but also saved many people when the blizzard hit the next day, which directly raised the prestige of the fourth prince among the people. All the soldiers who fought with him in the army looked at him with admiration and became loyal to him.But now, the trajectory of history had changed. It was Li Mingjin who went to the north, and the fourth prince would go to the south. He knew what might happen in the future in advance, and it was better to predict in advance than to be confused.Luo Shuyu nodded: \"That's fine, Your Highness is really smart, let's write a list to give to father.\"Li Mingjin completely believed him and he didn't ask anymore questions, he was really considerate, Luo Shuyu was really touched and felt warm all over his body.Li Mingjin couldn't help nodding, his wife's brain was good, the most important thing was that he was praised by his wife, and he was in a good mood: \"That's very good, let's go back to the palace again later, father must have a lot of good things, as long as we think of it, we will write it down in the list.\"Luo Shuyu asked him: \"Sure, are you being proud since you are favored? \"Li Mingjin suddenly planned for himself in a very methodical way: \"Let's take advantage of my father's love for me, let's ask for more benefits.\"Luo Shuyu smiled: \"Your Highness's words are too reasonable.\"In the next two days, Luo Shuyu tried hard to recall the details in the book, and wrote down all the names of the seeds that needed to be used, and Li Mingjin also obtained a lot of good things through other means, for food and drink, they were all pulled up to the mansion, and the whole capital was full of rumors that letting the third prince go to the north was a big failure in Emperor Tiansheng\u2019s decision-making, and some officials even asked Emperor Tiansheng to take back his order!The third prince didn't go to the front line to boost morale for the soldiers, he looked like he was going to go for on an outing!The matter quickly reached Emperor Tiansheng's ears. When he called Li Mingjin into the palace to find out about what happened, Li Mingjin entered the palace with the booklet he asked housekeeper Sun to copy.He handed the booklet to Emperor Tiansheng: \"Father, can you prepare everything in this booklet for your son?\"Emperor Tiansheng opened a thick stack of booklet: \"...Why do you need people and seeds? \"Li Mingjin once again said confidently: \"The son\u00a0has to send people to plant the land so we can have more delicious food. What if there is nothing to eat and the son and his wife will starve to death. \"Emperor Tiansheng thought with a headache, Li Mingjin was not going to go to war or go for an outing, he was planning to live a small life with his wife without his parents!The author has something to say:The Third Prince: Wife, can you see if the condoms I bought are enough to use on the road!Luo Shuyu: ...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To experience the feeling of pampering a wayward son and when he saw Li Mingjin's cheerful appearance, he thought it was worth to prepare these things.\u00a0After all, it was in the north, spring was warm and flowers were blooming in March and April in the capital, but it was still freezing over there, so more preparations would give you more security.In the blink of an eye, the taste of this year was getting weaker and weaker. More and more people knew that Luo Shuyu would follow Li Mingjin to the north. Even Luo Renshou went to the Third Prince's Mansion to meet Luo Shuyu himself.It was rumored outside that they went to the north for an \"outing\". In recent days, the servants of the Third Prince's Mansion bought this and that everywhere, so he also brought a cart of some miscellaneous things that would be useful for Luo Shuyu.Luo Shuyu looked at the list of the things he brought, they weren\u2019t gold, silver and jewellery, but a very practical things and quite useful, so he accepted it. Even the old lady Luo sent a thick robe and a pair of thick-soled deerskin boots for Li Mingjin.After accepting the gift, Luo Shuyu's attitude towards Luo Renshou became slightly better.Luo Renshou was a little flattered that he could get Luo Shuyu's smile. In fact, he just followed the wind. If everyone hadn't seen Emperor Tiansheng attitude towards the third prince in recent days, he wouldn\u2019t have been so active in running to the third prince's mansion.He also told Luo Shuyu about Shen Mingyun's movements. After the spring, Shen Mingyun would follow the Fourth Prince to the south.Shen Mingyun was going to the south with the Fourth Prince?Luo Shuyu really didn't expect that Shen Mingyun had just had a miscarriage, and his body might not have recovered yet, so he still thought about changing to another place to accumulate his points in the mall. Thinking about it, his love for the fourth prince didn't seem as strong as he imagined. If there is any problem between these two people, they would probably start to centrifugal. After all, Shen Mingyun couldn\u2019t keep the fourth prince\u2019s first child, and the fourth prince must have some psychological pimples.He just didn't know what Shen Mingyun would do under the guidance of the system after he went to the south. If he gained popularity or made some political achievements like the previous life in the north, didn\u2019t they give them a chance?After Luo Renshou left, Luo Shuyu directly informed this matter to Li Mingjin.Going to the south was not easy, Li Mingjin thought about it for a while and then told Luo Shuyu his analysis: \"We have our people by the fourth brother\u2019s side, and also, the trip to the south is not easy. The strong dragon can\u2019t repress the snake. The place where he will go to handle the case is Concubine Lin's natal house. It\u2019s not a day or two for the Lin family to run rampant in the local area. The local government and businessmen colluded, and the fourth brother might be assassinated on the way, so it\u2019s still a question whether they can get to Dong'an County smoothly.\"[\u5f3a\u9f99\u4e0d\u538b\u5730\u5934\u86c7\u00a0qi\u00e1ng l\u00f3ng b\u00f9 y\u0101 d\u00ec t\u00f3u sh\u00e9: lit. strong dragon can\u2019t repress a snake (idiom); fig. a local gangster who is above the law]In the book, it was only mentioned about Shen Mingyun going to the north, so he didn't know much about the uprising caused by the famine in the south. In the previous life, this matter must be suppressed by the Lin family in Dong'an, and didn\u2019t get disclosed in front of Emperor Tiansheng. If his rebirth caused the fourth prince to go to Dong'an County, it showed that his rebirth was of great significance.\"It might be difficult for the fourth prince if he goes alone, but he will bring Shen Mingyun with him. You also know that he is a bit unusual. With him, it can be estimated that many dangers can be resolved.\" Luo Shuyu was most afraid that they would discover new things because of various dangerous events. The system could always provide Shen Mingyun with useful information on a regular basis to help him and the Fourth Prince go higher and higher.\"Don't worry, our people will report the situation regularly.\" In fact, Li Mingjin sometimes found it strange that his wife paid less attention to the crown prince and the first prince who were powerful now, but the fourth younger brother who had a little influence became the person who made him nervous, was this Shen Mingyun really that powerful?Luo Shuyu also knew that it was useless to be overly concerned. He and Li Mingjin were about to go to the north, and the fourth prince and Shen Mingyun would also go to the south soon. The two parties developed independently, and it depended on who could seize the opportunity better in the end.If the Fourth Prince succeeded in this trip and he could suppress the First Prince's faction, he could give a sigh of relief for Emperor Tiansheng and gain Emperor Tiansheng's trust, but if he failed, it would definitely be of great benefit for him and Li Mingjin.Unknowingly, the time gradually coincided with the day of departure.The night before departure, Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin were about to fall asleep when someone who claimed to be the concubine Xian\u2019s people came to see Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin.They got a letter and a token belonging to General Zhenbei.The person who came was the eunuch next to Concubine Xian. Luo Shuyu had seen him before . Li Mingjin asked him, \"What does Concubine Xian mean?\"He and General Zhenbei hadn\u2019t met formally yet, and now that Concubine Xian sent this, he must represent General Zhenbei\u2019s meaning. For a while, Li Mingjin didn't understand why their family, who never stood in line, would give him this token before he left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Concubine Wei is familiar at first sight with the Third Imperial Concubine, and this token can save his life.\"The north was dominated by General Wei, and the generals who were guarding that side were all pulled up by him with one hand. Now Li Mingjin was going to take his place. In their eyes, Li Mingjin\u2019s hair hadn\u2019t even grown yet (not considered mature), so the generals over there would naturally disobey his orders and arrangements.Concubine Wei sent this token, it was really like sending charcoal in the snow.[\u96ea\u4e2d\u9001\u70ad\u00a0xu\u011b zh\u014dng s\u00f2ng t\u00e0n: lit. to send charcoal in snowy weather (idiom); fig. to provide help in sb's hour of need]Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin looked at each other, and said to the eunuch: \"Go back and tell Concubine Wei that Shuyu thanks him for the gift, and he understands what he means.\"The eunuch left with Luo Shuyu's reply.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin put away the tokens, but he was still a little worried: \"Why is General Wei willing to give us the tokens?\"Luo Shuyu didn't really know much about the court affairs, so he wanted to ask a little bit.Li Mingjin told him: \"Do you know that a tall tree attracts the wind? Although General Wei has fought for the Li family for generations, if father promotes him again, he can only be the Zhenbei Wang. Now the people in the north only know General Zhenbei but not father.\u201d[\u6811\u5927\u62db\u98ce\u00a0sh\u00f9 d\u00e0 zh\u0101o f\u0113ng: lit. a tall tree attracts the wind (idiom); fig. a famous or rich person attracts criticism][\u9547\u00a0zh\u00e8n: to press down; to calm; to subdue; to suppress; to guard;\u00a0\u5317\u00a0b\u011bi: north][\u738b\u00a0W\u00e1ng: to rule; to reign over]\u201cIn the past, General Wei didn't stand in line, and the concubine Wei didn't have children. He is just looking for a way out for the Wei family. General Wei is now in his sixtieth. His sons are quite talented and learned well, they have made great achievements in the army. They are too prominent and they are feared by father. The Wei family belongs to the military officials and the civil servants of the crown prince's faction are in opposition, and the Wei family and Concubine Lin's family also had rifts in the early years.\"Luo Shuyu sighed: \"\u00a0It turns out that there are so many things inside.\"He remembered that it was mentioned in the book that when the fourth prince first arrived in the north, the generals in the north under General Wei treated him very badly. Later, he and Shen Mingyun chose to take revenge on the Wei family. When General Wei resigned and returned home, his two sons in the army disagreed with the fourth prince many times. One lost his life, and the other lost an arm. As for concubine Wei, he also met Shen Mingyun in the later period, and there were some minor conflicts. His ending was not so good either, on the day Emperor Tiansheng died, he went with Emperor Tiansheng.None of the Wei family in the previous life ended well, which made people sigh.Luo Shuyu now received the token given to him by the concubine Wei, which was really beyond his expectation. In his previous life, Shen Mingyun and the fourth prince didn't seem to have this kind of treatment, but it might be because the concubine Wei didn't like them, which led to the whole familysacrificed themself for the country and their end was dismal. From another perspective, the emperor's suspicion was indeed a chilling thing, but the emperor would change, and those who didn't stand in line and didn't fit in with the group would eventually be excluded.Finally they could set off.Emperor Tiansheng deliberately asked Qin Tian to monitor and calculate the departure date. The more Li Mingjin asked him for more things, like an addiction, the more he worried that they wouldn\u2019t have enough food and clothing on the way to the north, so he added 50% more to the people and things Li Mingjin asked for, and gave as much as he could.[\u94a6\u00a0\u5929\u00a0Qin Tian: official to observe the sky, calculate the solar terms, and formulate the calendar]The journey was long, and on the day they set off, Emperor Tiansheng personally took people to the gate of the city to see them off.Luo Renshou also came to see them off. He also wanted to play a scene of father\u2019s kindness and son\u2019s filial piety with Luo Shuyu, but Luo Shuyu didn't give him a chance and he stood by Li Mingjin's side the whole time.The auspicious time for departure had arrived, Luo Shuyu got into the carriage, Li Mingjin got on the horse. They left the capital in the presence of Emperor Tiansheng and other courtiers.Luo Shuyu opened the carriage curtain and looked out. It was the first time he left the capital in his two lives, and the first time he was truly away from the protagonist in the book Shen Mingyun. He felt an indescribable sense of relief.However, he would come back again to get the peace of mind that belonged to him and Li Mingjin.All the way to the north.After they left the capital, the further you went to the north, the lower the temperature on the road. Luo Shuyu could feel the temperature was getting lower and lower while he was sitting in the carriage covered with thick cushions.Although it hadn't snowed these days, the mountains were covered with snow as far as the eye could see.For the first three days, Luo Shuyu would poke his head out and look around, but then he felt bored.The scenery was indeed beautiful, even after seeing too much, they could no longer feel it unusual. After all, they\u00a0\u00a0hastened on with one's journey, not having a snow feast.Luo Shuyu felt bored, and Li Mingjin naturally felt tired and bored, but neither of them showed it.Today was the seventh day of their departure.At this time, the soldiers who explored the road came back and reported that there was a flat place one mile ahead where they could set up camp.Li Mingjin brought people to the north this time, most of them were the generals with no experience going to the north, and there were not many experienced generals. Originally, he only brought five thousand soldiers. Later, after Li Mingjin asked Emperor Tiansheng for help, he sent him another two thousand soldiers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The people who served Luo Shuyu also followed them. The seven days of working together also allowed them to adjust a set of cooperation methods. Each of them was very active and no one dared to make trouble for the time being. Their masters could endure the hardships, there was no reason for them to start complaining first.They were on the road everyday, so they couldn\u2019t eat as good as the ones at the mansion, and they couldn\u2019t have enough rest. Most of the people who just left the capital had lost a lot of weight, and all of them had backaches in the past seven days.Luo Shuyu also felt sore all over. Occasionally, he would get out of the carriage for a walk when he was bored. Sometimes he would ride a horse with Li Mingjin to enjoy the scenery along the way.After getting off the carriage, Luo Shuyu bent down and beat his own legs, and then he asked Li Mingjin who was setting up the tent with the soldiers, \"Your Highness, how long will it take us to get there?\"Ansan took over Li Mingjin's work and Li Mingjin replied to Luo Shuyu: \"If it\u2019s slow, it will take about a month and a half, and if it\u2019s fast, it may take almost a month.\"Luo Shuyu sighed, and when the cold wind hit him, he wrapped his fur clothes tightly: \"It\u2019s faster than I imagined.\" It\u2019s even colder, how do the people in the north survive the winter.\u201d: \"If it was slow, it would take about a month and a half, and if it was fast, it may take almost a month.\"Luo Shuyu sighed, when a cold wind hit, he wrapped his fur clothes tightly: \"It's colder than I imagined. How do the people in the north spend the winter?\"Lin Haiming walked over at some point: \"The people in the north have a kang in their homes, and there is a fire underneath. It's not cold at all, which is better than ours. It's much warmer with a charcoal basin.\"Lin Haiming came over at this time: \"The people in the north all have kangs in their homes, and there is fire underneath, so it's not cold at all, and it's much warmer than using charcoal basins.\"[\u7095\u00a0k\u00e0ng: a heatable brick bed]Luo Shuyu: \"So that\u2019s how it is, I'm ignorant, please forgive me. \"Lin Haiming said truthfully: \"The third imperial concubine is humble, you undertand more knowledge than I do, my father scolded me all day long for not being able to write poems well.\"Luo Shuyu laughed and said: \"To compose poems is merely for ceremonial, those arty things are only for the peaceful and prosperous age, there is a specialization in art, so why bother to embarrass yourself ?\"Lin Haiming: \"I have to write down what you said and tell my father. I have lived for so many years and haven\u2019t understood the truth. \"Li Mingjin didn't give him any face: \"Because you are stupid.\"Luo Shuyu rubbed her palms and smiled: \"Both of you talk, I'll go and see what they will do at night.\"All they ate in the road was dry food and not as free as when they were in the mansion, there were vegetables and fruits, and there was no shortage of them everyday.All the apples that Li Mingjin ate now were brought from the capital. The further they went to the north, the more desolate it would be. It was no wonder that everyone wanted to go to the capital to find a way out.However, after passing this hurdle, Luo Shuyu may never leave the capital, and may be thrown into a mass grave again and wrapped in straw mats.In the evening, a pot of cabbage soup was cooked, and a few soldiers went to hunt wild rabbits and came back. They ate roasted rabbit meat, steamed buns and soup, it was a full meal. On the way, many soldiers praised the third prince and the third imperial concubine for being different from what they had imagined.They thought that the third prince should be arrogant and domineering, only knew how to use extravagant carriages and horses, he would complain all kinds of things along the way, while the third imperial concubine And the third concubine should be delicate and squeamish, he would need someone to support him when he walked two steps, he would get sick one day, lose his temper the next day, huddle in the carriage and criy everyday.However, the soldiers didn\u2019t see these kind of situations that they imagined.The third prince made the fire, cooked, cleared the snow and set up the tent like them, the third imperial concubine would personally carry the bedding into the tent, and the food they ate was almost the same like them. Although they didn't laugh at everyone, at least they never disliked them soldiers, and they never see them bossing around.How did that happen?\u00a0The rumors were not true.Furthermore, there were also more than a dozen of agricultural officials who were thrown into the team by Emperor Tiansheng. They were even more miserable, they were suddenly sent to the north. They thought that the third prince and the third imperial concubine would make a fuss on the road, and they could also make a fuss, but who knew that they could endure the hardships and cold, so no one dared to talk nonsense for a while and did what they should do.In the team of 7,000 people, there were still some dudes who were stuffed into the team by their families. If it was the fourth prince, it was still possible for them to do nothing, but now they were following Li Mingjin. He always kept an eye on them, and with the whip used by Taizu back then, no matter how much resentment they had, they could only vent it in private, and they didn\u2019t dare to make trouble in front of Li MingjinAfter getting along for a long time, their team was quite harmonious, after all, they would follow the third prince in the future.After traveling on the road for more than a month, Li Mingjin and Luo Shuyu finally stepped into the territory where they would live for many years in the future.Luo Shuyu and Li Mingjin rode on the same horse, Luo Shuyu leaned his back on Li Mingjin\u2019s chest and said, \"Your Highness, we are finally here.\"Looking at the land that was obviously more desolate than the capital, Li Mingjin asked Luo Shuyu: \"Are you afraid? I don't know how long we will live in this place in the future \"Luo Shuyu shook his head: \"Not afraid, I believe we can establish better here.\"This would be their first stop in the future.Li Mingjin's eyes lit up, and he raised his hand: \"Enter the city!\"Luo Shuyu had never heard Li Mingjin's voice so loud like this, as if he had activated a special mechanism to release this desire that had been hidden in the capital for many years. He thought, Li Mingjin was an eagle that lacked a piece of sky that belonged to him.Now, he had found his piece of sky where he could soar in the sky freely.No one would tie him down again.Fly, Your Highness.The author has something to say:The Third Prince: Wife, get on the kang!Luo Shuyu: ...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
