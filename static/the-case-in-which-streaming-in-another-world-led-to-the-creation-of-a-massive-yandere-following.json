    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1:\u00a0I\u2019m a Streamer! (Haishinsha)Ataraxia is a world where magic has developed and is the home to many civilizations.Not just humans but even demons exist, and they have been in endless conflicts since ancient times.In such a world, there is something called the Magic Measurement, which, although not a good way of putting it, rates people who live in it.It is a world rich in magic, where the very existence and strength of magic power is a matter of course.Of course, there exist some great people who can\u2019t use magic yet accomplish incredible achievements with swordsmanship. However, such results are due to the tireless effort and a long time, whereas ordinary people fail before even reaching that point.Well, in general, the usual way people live is by being able to handle magic and learning swordsmanship.Now, let\u2019s talk about the boy who lives in such a world.He turned seventeen this year and is attending the Royal Academy established in the Royal City of Sistol, the heart of the Kingdom of Logias.In other words, it\u2019s a place attended mainly by aristocrats with money, but depending on their magic rank, some commoners are allowed entrance to the academy.There sure exists a clash of statuses, but because the teachers are excellent, there are not many major conflicts.\u201c\u2026 Fuwaa, I\u2019m so sleepy.\u201dHe yawned as he put on a white uniform given to him by the academy.With black hair and brown eyes, unusual in this world, a face that does not stand out in particular, and a physique that is neither large nor small, the boy\u2019s name is Kanata, which is as unusual as it sounds.In this world, family names exist only for nobles, so no such thing exists for commoners.In other words, Kanata is a commoner because he lacks a family name. Yet, for one reason or another, he attends this revered academy.\u201cI\u2019ve been here for a while, but this world really doesn\u2019t resemble my previous life.\u201dHe mentioned his previous life.Yes, he is a reincarnated person who was reborn in this world.In his old world, magic didn\u2019t exist, while in this new world, it does, and like everyone, he was very excited when he found out about it.After experiencing reincarnation into another world, which has become popular recently, he found himself blessed with powers perfect for the new world.Infinite magical power. As per definition, his body got blessed with inexhaustible magic power.The magic ranks range from SSS, SS, S, and A all the way down to F, at the very bottom.However, he realized that this infinite magic power was a nuisance for him to live quietly, so he adjusted the magic power he put into the magical measurement, resulting in a grade of S.\u201cYo, plebeian, why don\u2019t you just disappear for good?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. This is not a place for a lowly person like you.\u201dBeing a commoner, this was a normal thing to be told by the noble students on a daily basis.Violence and the use of magic don\u2019t go that far because the teachers are excellent, as mentioned previously, but\u2026 this level of deep-seated discrimination is common.\u201cTell that to the teacher. I don\u2019t give a s**t even if you tell me.\u201d\u201cDamn you\u2026\u201d\u201cHow impudent!\u201dAnd apparently, aristocratic students have a low boiling point.Well, nobles have a sense of being part of a family of chosen blood. It\u2019s like they felt their pride hurt by Kanata, who is just a commoner.They approached Kanata silently.Kanata thought there might be some trouble, but a dainty voice echoed through the room to stop them.\u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026!!\u201d\u201cMaria-sama\u2026\u201dIt was a beautiful girl who appeared dashingly.Her golden hair swayed, and her blue eyes, which exudes her willfulness, shone through to the noble students.Her face was very well shaped, and her uneven body radiated a tremendous s*x appeal.This girl\u2019s name was Maria Ataraxis, the third princess, a member of the royal family that ruled the kingdom.The noble students fawned over Maria but soon looked down as if afraid of her strong gaze.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s a noble or a commoner as long as he attends this academy, he has\u2026 No, all commoners are here because they are qualified to do so. Stop imposing your silly pride on them.\u201d\u201cYe\u2026s.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter being scolded by Maria, the noble students left at a quick pace.It is not uncommon for the commoners, like Kanata, to be saved by Maria.She is truly in a position to lead her people as royalty.That is why, whether it is her sense of responsibility or not, she sees all the people residing in this country as equals.\u201cThank you, Maria-sama.\u201dKanata had spoken rudely to the noble students, but when the other party was royalty, Kanata changed his attitude.The current exchange was tantamount to child\u2019s play because of his previous life\u2019s memories. However, Kanata is still cautious because he knows what will happen if he makes enemies with the royal family.\u201cIt\u2019s all right. But you knew it would upset them if you talked back to them like that.\u201dHe knew that, but it was annoying, so he muttered to himself.\u201cSeriously, why do people clash because of their different statuses? You really should listen to what Haishin-sama has to say.\u201d\u201cDid you just say something?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m done here. Are you going straight home?\u201d\u201cYeah~\u201dSo Kanata and Maria parted ways, and Kanata went straight to the student dormitory.Most of the other students would share a room, but it was unusual for a commoner like Kanata to have a magic rank of S.So he was given a room all to himself\u2026 It\u2019s not that he was never looked at strangely by even the commoners and that no one wanted to room with him, apparently.\u201cWell, let\u2019s get back to work then!\u201dHe entered the room, locked the door firmly, and activated the terminal on the desk.It is a working terminal given to all students, but this terminal specifically was one that Kanata has made various improvements to through his own efforts.It is like a personal computer in the original world, and having this terminal was the very thing that made him start doing the activities that he now does for a living.[Right on time. All right, everyone! How was your day? It must have been hard for the students with their schoolwork and the adults with their jobs, right?]When he spoke into the microphone near the terminal, countless letters appeared on the screen in response to his words.Yes, he was doing what we call streaming in this world in the other world.The new world had established communication using terminals. However, such technology was unable to deliver such worlds to an unspecified number of people.However, since it is possible to make a new attempt at this world\u2019s network with magical power, Kanata created a pseudo-real-world streaming site using his infinite magic power.Creating a single network requires a tremendous amount of magical power. Under normal circumstances, one\u2019s magic power would run out in a matter of minutes without the aid of some magic item or other external help.However, there is no need to be troubled because the word \u2018infinite\u2019 was on Kanata\u2019s side.[Today, I saw a disgraceful scene. There was a fight between an aristocrat and a commoner again. I heard that the conflict caused by differences in status would never disappear, but why is it like that when everyone should be having fun instead of squabbling like that?]The first sentences were an objective description of the event Kanata had just experienced, to which he received numerous replies.Kanata smiled at the endless words he received, and he wondered how he had become so famous.This pastime, which did not exist in this other world, spread at record speed, especially among the young people who had access to the terminals.It is unknown whether or not people of various countries, including kings, princesses or others of high status look forward to this event.Although Kanata could have used his name, the name he goes by when streaming is Haishin.I\u2019m not going to lie, but in a sense, Haishin\u2019s name has a great impact on this world.Given that his magic power never runs out no matter how long he talks, each country wants to get their hands on him. At the same time, even if someone wants to hijack his broadcasting, they can\u2019t take over and stop unless they direct more magic power than Kanata into it. In other words, in this world, there is no one with more magic power than Kanata, who possesses unlimited magic power.No one can stop this streaming.(I never thought that the dream of being able to broadcast my work in this world would turn out to be so crazy.)Kanata was satisfied because he was able to become the streamer he once longed to be in his previous world.[Well then. I\u2019m going to read everyone\u2019s messages today as well~]Today he continued to entertain his viewers as usual.This is the story of a boy reborn with unlimited magical power.He doesn\u2019t flaunt the magic power that makes him the strongest. He is neither interested in being a hero nor a warrior but only does what he thinks is fun.There are those who were captivated by his streaming and had their destinies changed, where some were even saved. He does not yet know that he is the hope of countless beings.He does not yet know that there are those who will appear in the world of Ataraxia who will be known as Haishin worshippers.Now the curtain has risen on the life of the man who would later become the legendary streamer!TLN- As usual, still unsure of picking this series, well lets see\u2026 updates will be twice a week. Lemme know what you guys think of this type of stories\u2026 Have fun reading, next chap will arrive shortly, have a great day, and dont mind shibe.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: I\u2019m going to tell you the whole story, so listen upStreaming in the other world is not that different from what Kanata had seen in his previous life.There is no such thing as video games in this world, so there is inevitably a lot of rambling\u2026 but his chat is also open to things such as giving his advice on people\u2019s problems.\u201cLet\u2019s have a look at the messages. Erm\u2026 what does it say?\u201dAlthough it is said to be a consultation about some worries, he often receives a few boastful stories that people want him to read while everyone else listens to the now famous Haishin.Apparently, the first letter he picked out randomly was that kind of boast.[Yo, Haishin, listen to my saga.I\u2019m a B-rank party adventurer.I\u2019m not yet twenty, but I\u2019ve been able to build up a certain amount of strength, and I\u2019m also the leader of my party.The other day, a useless piece of garbage came to our party.He\u2019s a piece of trash since he can only do things like scouting, weapon maintenance, and support magic.When I told him this morning that I don\u2019t want trash like him and that he should leave the party, he cried and clung to me. It was painful.]It was reminiscent of something Kanata had often read in a previous life, as if to say, \u201cThis guy was destined to be a sucker.\u201dThe sender\u2019s name seemed to be Acta, but Kanata sighed and replied.[Are you stupid? Being able to search for enemies, care for weapons, and use support magic is pretty competent. Why are you acting like you\u2019re better than him?]The person who told Kanata to read his story was one of his followers in his stream.But Kanata doesn\u2019t care about any of that. He just says what he wants to say, honestly.It is what makes him so popular. Either for his antipathy or, opposite to it, his frankness and objective opinions on any subject.[When you\u2019re an adventurer, you go to all types of dungeons, right? So, it would be helpful to have a scout who can find the monsters before they find you, am I right? And if he takes care of your weapons for you, you can save a lot of money compared to going to a store, no? Of course, you\u2019ll have to pay him a fair price for his services as a companion.]There are still many things Kanata has to say.There were many comments flowing on the screen, and while some certainly wondered if they should care about such garbage, most comments on chat were normal, saying, for the most part, that the person was horrible, etc.[And support magic is not so useless either. Hey, man, has having that guy around made you feel better? Something that makes you stronger than usual? Think back often to all the little things that make you stronger or easier to fight. If that rings any bells, it\u2019s a result of you benefiting from that support magic.]After saying that much, Kanata drank the drink that was on hand.The number of viewers got displayed at the corner of the screen, and it was quite successful, with over 10,000 people connected.[Well, I don\u2019t care what you think, but you\u2019re not a hero. You\u2019re just bullying the weak and getting all worked up about it. If you\u2019re the party leader, you should pay attention to their skills and give them proper recognition. Otherwise, you\u2019ll die later wishing he had been there when you were.]Kanata laughed and said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s just a paraphrase of a certain knowledge.\u201dIt had been a while since he received such a template in another world, so he said many things, but Kanata wasn\u2019t sure if his message went through or not.Even if he\u2019s a bit of a bad character, he\u2019s still one of his followers. That\u2019s why he just hopes for him to live a long life.[Let\u2019s move on to the next message~]Kanata looked over the next message, which was also peculiar.[Nice to meet you, Haishin. I am the son of a certain senior nobleman.I have a fianc\u00e9e I\u2019m supposed to be with in the future, but my fianc\u00e9e is just so unsociable.She looks down when I say anything to her, and she doesn\u2019t say anything back.I\u2019m not sure if I can get along with her, but recently a lovely girl came to our school.I was fascinated by her dainty smile, you know.Surely Haishin would agree that I should choose that one over my unsociable fianc\u00e9e? I\u2019d like to hear your opinion.][\u2026 Hah~]Kanata let out a loud sigh.Although the message\u2019s content differed from the previous one, it was the same problem.[You\u2019d be better off dead anyway.]He was too straightforward.Kanata was a commoner and naturally had no one to call him fianc\u00e9e.So his words express his feeling that just having a girl he can be with in the future is a boon, dammit.[Listen, man. You can\u2019t just decide on your own what to do with your fianc\u00e9e, who got chosen because of family circumstances. Don\u2019t you think it is naive to believe that you can convince both families by telling them this is your true love and you can\u2019t live without one another? Hn?]Those were well-intended words from Kanata, who maintained a life without a girlfriend in both previous and current lives.The other party was a high-ranking aristocrat, but Kanata was not about to let that stop him.[You might be attracted to this lovely girl just by looking at her outward appearance, right? Maybe she\u2019s a b***h on the inside. Or maybe, she is a sleaze who gets together with all kinds of guys behind your back. Don\u2019t be too blind in love. Also, you should talk with your fianc\u00e9e more often. If she\u2019s looking down and not talking back to you, it\u2019s possible she\u2019s just embarrassed.]The comments were quite lively, and there was quite a lot of criticism of the man.Some of them might not have a girlfriend, or they might not be able to get married and lead a lonely life.He nodded and said he could understand because he was one of them.[Listen up if you have a fianc\u00e9e just like this guy and think something similar. Engagements are for the sake of an invaluable family connection. I can understand wanting to break up with someone if they are irredeemable garbage, but otherwise, try to make more effort to get to know your partner. Put your hand on your heart and think about it. Do you really know about your partner or not?]He saw a few comments of agreement here and there, but on the other hand, it means that a good number of guys with fianc\u00e9es are watching Kanata\u2019s streaming.Kanata took a deep breath as he was about to shout something that would never get across in this world, \u201cExplode you Riajuus!\u201d[If you\u2019re still going to let her go, then introduce her to me. I want a girlfriend too, you idiot.]With that last remark, Kanata ended the topic.Yes, even Kanata wanted to be popular and have a girlfriend.But reality doesn\u2019t work like that. Even with unlimited magic power, it\u2019s not something that could be achieved.Even if his rank is S, Kanata\u2019s current situation implies that there is no connection between the rank and the popularity factor.\u201cI\u2019ve said quite a bit\u2026 Hmm?\u201dThen, Kanata found a certain comment.It was a coloured comment, meaning that the money was transferred to the account Kanata had created along with the text.It\u2019s what we call throwing money in the previous world, and Kanata got to achieve that in this world.[TLN: SIMP DETECTED :samuraidoggo:][From: Nameless PrincessHaishin-sama, I am happy to hear your voice today. This is my way of thanking you for all you have done for me. Please accept it by all means.]Ten gold coins got sent attached to the text.One gold coin in this world is 10,000 yen in the previous life, which means that someone donated 100,000 yen to him at that moment.[EDN: $754 USD][Thank you, Princess \u266a, but you donated to me yesterday as well\u2026 Hey, did you borrow these from your parents or someone else? Are you sure you\u2019re alright?]Although he was grateful for the daily help, Nameless Princess is one of those followers who always donates money to Kanata.Just thinking about it gives one the chills, but Kanata is not at all perplexed about receiving the money because there is nothing better than having it.[No problem. It\u2019s all from my pocket money\u2026 By the way, Haishin-sama, may I volunteer to be your girlfriend? No, rather, let me!][Thanks, Princess, but I\u2019ll ask for you when I get a chance.]Kanata flushed lightly.Her name is Princess, and she speaks like a woman, but Kanata knows about such people.There exist beings in this world who pretend to be women even though they are men, a.k.a. nekama.[EDN: Heh.]He knows that as the only person who can stream in this world, Kanata is on their radar.So he has no intention of meeting with anyone under any circumstances, and he definitely has no intention of revealing himself to anyone.[I\u2019m going to finish up here for today. See you all tomorrow then!]With those words, today\u2019s streaming ended.Turning off the terminal, Kanata rests his back against the chair and exhales in a huff.\u201cI wonder if the streaming in the previous world was like this too\u2026 It\u2019s so much fun.\u201dWith a giggle, Kanata left the room to eat his food.The streaming Kanata does as Haishin is really popular. Little does he know that sometimes he can make someone change their behaviour and save someone destined to be unhappy.Rather, it is not only humans who watch his streams. He would have never imagined he has followers among the demonic tribes, who are hostile to humans.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Case In Which Streaming In Another World Led To The Creation Of A Massive Yandere FollowingCH 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 03: First Believer, Maria AtaraxisThe influence of the man who calls himself Haishin, who appeared like a comet in Ataraxia, is tremendous.There are many who have been saved and shown the way by his words.Haishin\u2019s impartial views and mention of the risks that may arise on the topics, which were unreserved when confronting them, often stuck in the minds of those who listened to him.(I want to hear your opinion about something like this, I\u2019m having a hard time, and I need help figuring out the answer, or I did something like this\u2026)Anyway, many such worries got sent to Haishin every day.[Let\u2019s start with your messages as usual, shall we? By the way, for people who are new to this channel, I say everything without regard for your identity or anything of the sort, as we are all anonymous here. We are all equals in this network, so be prepared for my words as I think I can abuse you without any reservation.]Haishin\u2019s words were truly merciless.If some disagree, verbal abuse and cursing at him are the norms, but there are definitely some that will be annoyed enough to throw the terminal in hand.However, from the perspective of those who aren\u2019t involved in the matter, what he says is absolutely correct.What if you were in that position? What if the risks he mentioned had actually occurred to you?There are many who have gotten deterred from thinking about it.[Anyways, it\u2019s common knowledge that demons are the ones to be destroyed\u2026 Hmm\u2026 But still, I don\u2019t get why. Sure. Humans and demons have been fighting for ages, but why can\u2019t they just get along\u2026]Haishin said something like this.It is a common thought for humans that the demon tribe is an existence that ought to get eliminated, but he disagrees with it outright.People claim that it\u2019s not just young people who listen to his stream, but even the heads of the state, so his words caused a stir among his followers, wondering if he had betrayed humanity.[The more they fight, the more damage is done to each other. It may be impossible to get along with everyone, but I\u2019m sure there are some good people among the demons. Even among humans, there surely are many who want to get along with demons without fighting. But all I can do is speak here since I\u2019m in no such position. I\u2019ll just have to leave that to the higher-ups of the human and demon races.]He is a man of integrity but also a man of equality.He never takes sides with either humans or demons, and his words are always neutral.Because of that, he had a certain number of followers from the demon tribe in respectable positions. They all respect Haishin for his magnificent qualities.\u201cAhh, Haishin-sama\u2026 you have such a wonderful voice. I would love to meet you to thank you for saving me from my troubles!\u201dAnd now that he\u2019s recognized and famous online, a fan base for him has already been made.The girl who just now expressed her passionate feelings for Haishin was also a serious believer.The pretty lady on the clean bed holding the device to her ample bosom is the third princess of the kingdom, Maria Ataraxis.She had been his fan for a long time now.She was not interested in his streaming at first. She had only heard a few words about it, but when her friend recommended Haishin, she got to know him in earnest and got completely hooked on his streams.\u201cYou are truly a wonder, Haishin-sama. Your gentle voice is so pleasant to my ears that it feels like you were ravishing my brain and dyeing every inch of my body with you. Ahh, Haishin-sama, I want to devote myself to you. I want to live my life for you.\u201dOne could tell her mind is already past the line with how she writhes while having an ecstatic smile. She had turned into a follower of a troublesome level. She was no longer the princess who\u2019d garnered the hearts of the people in the kingdom, but a stalker-level pesky woman, without a doubt.\u201dI was able to send my feelings to Haishin-sama today as well. Fufu, there is nothing to worry about, Haishin-sama. The money is from in my pocket, and I am compensated properly for my duties as a princess \u266a~\u201dShe is just a SIMP who gives all her earnings to a streamer.[TLN: It says otaku, but I know she\u2019s actually a simp.]Yes, she is Nameless Princess who donates to Haishin regularly, and she has been doing it ever since the \u2018throw-away money\u2019 function (donation button) got implemented in his streams. She sent a lot of money as the most obvious appeal.\u201cI\u2019m the one who supports Haishin-sama\u2019s life\u2026 Hue\u2026 Huhuehehe \u266a\u201dThe sight of her sickening delightful smile made her roommate sigh in resignation.\u201cMaria, you look terrible!\u201d\u201cHuhe\u2026 Ahn Haishin-sama!\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s done for already.\u201dNo one\u2019s voice seems to be able to reach Maria anymore.There was a reason why Maria worshiped Haishin so much in the first place. It was him whom she learned how to deal with people and the absurdity of this world.For Maria, who longs for peace, her greatest wish is that her people can live in peace, but the world\u2019s circumstances cast a shadow over her mind.There was a time she visited a slave market at a moment\u2019s notice.Slavery is allowed in Royal Capital, but Maria was shocked to learn about the poor conditions of the slaves.It is common knowledge in this world that slaves have no such thing as human rights and are to be used and crushed, but Maria got merely taught about it as a passing matter from her textbooks.\u201c\u2026 Who\u2019s there?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do what you say. Please don\u2019t hurt me!\u201d\u201cYou royalty will never understand our suffering!\u201dMaria was heartbroken when she found out there were beings who couldn\u2019t live like normal, even though they were also people.Although she wondered if there was anything she could do about it, there was no clear answer.It was a difficult problem to deal with because it involved meddling in the very rules of the country. Even some ministers made a profit through the slave trade.That\u2019s when Haishin showed her the way.[Slavery? Ah, it\u2019s true that the hidden part of the system is unbearable to see. I mean. That system is the same in Royal Capital, right? Seriously, it\u2019s so rotten. If I were a slave, I\u2019d definitely build up a lot of resentment, enough that one day, I\u2019d plan to beat all of them to death, including the royal family.]The words reminded Maria of the eyes that had stared at her from the bars.[Even slaves have a life, you know. Someone wants them to be born, and\u2026 Well, unfortunately, there may be some who don\u2019t. But since we were born into this world, everyone has the right to live and to decide how they want to live. Even if we can\u2019t completely abolish slavery, maybe we can create a new system that provides a little better environment for them.]Maria agreed that it might be possible to create a new system rather than eliminate slavery completely.[I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re coming from, but for someone like me, it doesn\u2019t matter if I speak. I know it can be frustrating to take a scalpel to an old rule, but it is also true that you can save many lives if you take action. You know, they could be the people who got sold because of debt or people that got kidnapped and peddled. I hope you\u2019ll try something new to make these people see that there\u2019s hope for them in this world.]He was merely answering a question as Haishin.But it moved Maria\u2014 No, not only Maria but her brothers, sisters and cousins who listened to Haishin\u2019s sayings.After explaining the situation to her father, the king, and her mother, the queen, Maria led the country into action, accompanied by her ministers.The age-old practice of slavery had undergone a transformation, and the problem of slaves in inhospitable environments got neatly solved.There are also regular investigations by the government to prevent a recurrence, and the slaves no longer suffered as they did before.[Well, the best thing we could do would be to eliminate slavery itself, but we can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s another deep-rooted problem.]Maria nodded in approval, saying that was indeed true.It was a problem that could change if someone had made a move, and it was definitely Haishin who encouraged her to take a step forward on that path.No, it would have been more meaningful to give all credit to Haishin himself, as he was already quite famous in the Royal Capital in the first place.\u201cHaishin-sama\u2026 I will follow you, Haishin-sama. Haishin-sama, I will follow you. From now on and forever, the path you showed me is absolute and never wrong. Whatever you tell me to do, I will do. Everything you say is white is white, and when you say black, it is black!\u201d[EDN: All you say is right will be correct, and all you say is wrong will be wrong.]From then on, she kept watching his stream, which resulted in the birth of a pesky affirmative simp.Incidentally, there are a good number of extreme listeners like Maria, and they appear to be scattered throughout various countries.Of course, there may be some people in Sistor, but no one would say that it was her who sent the money under that name.[I don\u2019t see the necessity for the nobility and the commoners to quarrel. Why don\u2019t they just get along with each other?]\u2018~Then I will be one to mediate between the commoners and the nobles,\u2019 Maria engraved this in her soul.Underlying Maria\u2019s frequent intervention in disputes between commoners and nobles at the academy were Haishin\u2019s words.Honestly, nobles and commoners held no importance in her mind. She just wants to find pleasure in submitting to Haishin\u2019s words by doing so\u2015\u2015she is truly an honorary Haishin devotee.And just like her, there are many \u2018Haishin Devotees\u2019 here in Ataraxia.Surely, Haishin wouldn\u2019t have thought that such a fearless, monstrous, passionate group of followers had been born.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A prime example is Nameless Princess, who can be considered a very wealthy person\u2026\u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing wrong with having money. I\u2019m grateful.\u201dMoney doesn\u2019t betray you. In fact, money is the only thing you can believe in. There is basically nothing you can\u2019t do with money in any world.After finishing the preparations to head to the academy, Kanata left the room with his luggage in hand.He still walks down the road with no one next to him.It would have been nice to have at least one friend since Kanata has always been alone.\u201cMorning~\u201cWhen he entered the classroom attended by S-ranked magicians, he greeted them, though barely anyone heard his voice. Still, it was better than saying nothing.By the way, Maria, who helped him yesterday, is SSS rank, and the two noble students who got involved are both S rank.Those two guys glared at him from within the classroom as if they were still bitter about yesterday\u2019s incident.\u201c\u2026 Sigh. What a pain.\u201dKanata found the piercing gaze bothersome, so he plopped down on his desk.He was going to do nothing and wait until the teacher in charge came, but the girls gathered next to him started talking.\u201cYesterday\u2019s stream was interesting, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. Though he\u2019s got a bad mouth, his comments are right. I couldn\u2019t get used to it at first, but recently I\u2019ve become a bigger fan than ever.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s sort of addictive, no? And now he\u2019s become so popular too. So much that one of his words holds enough power to change an entire nation.\u201dKanata\u2019s ears twitched.The girls wouldn\u2019t have believed that Haishin, Kanata\u2019s persona, was nearby.But Kanata had no intention of introducing himself to them because, even if he did, they wouldn\u2019t believe him.(Believe it or not, it feels great. Being a celebrity is the best!)It made him wonder for a moment if this is how it felt to be an influencer in his original world.Kanata is the only person who can stream in this world.Several people have tried to imitate him, but no one has ever been able to do it because it requires a huge amount of magic power.So Kanata is the only one dominating this path.\u201cAs they say, a streamer\u2026 but I\u2019m a little different. Though it reads the same way, I\u2019m a Haishin-sha, and I\u2019m gonna run through that road.\u201d[TLN: Haishin-sha are also streamers, but they usually hide their identity with a mask or change their voice through editing. Basically, they want to remain anonymous, just like hackers?]It was his dream.Even with his limitless magic power, he neither had the interest in becoming a hero nor any desire to conquer the world.[TLN: \u4ffatueeeee (I\u2019m OP) expression is somewhat confusing to deal with.]All he wants to do is to stream.(\u2026 As of now, it\u2019s just voice only, but I hope to be able to do video stream, at least by showing my hands. Let\u2019s see what I can do to improve.)He had no idea how long it would take, but it\u2019d be fun to introduce some of the fascinating items in this world. Kanata laughed while thinking about it.The time passed quickly, and the joint class from SSS rank to S rank began.There were a fair number of people because everyone got told that a court magician, the pride of the kingdom, was coming to give them a lecture on something.\u201c\u2026 How boring.\u201dHaving infinite magical power is a cheat because there is almost nothing Kanata can\u2019t do regarding magic power.Even if the court magician can use higher rank magic, the lower rank magic that Kanata can unleash is far greater in terms of strength and range.\u201cAs you can see, magic is your imagination and\u2015\u201dThe people in the classroom listened to him seriously, but from Kanata\u2019s point of view, it was boring.He yawned in secret, trying not to be obvious, but apparently, someone sitting next to him had seen what he had just done.\u201c?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hun, S-Class, huh?\u201dThe guy who snickered was a handsome guy.The golden badge on his chest indicates that he belongs to the SSS class, so from his point of view, he was just mocking Kanata, who is a lower rank.Well. From Kanata\u2019s point of view, everyone is at a lower rank when it comes to magic power, and the provocation of that handsome man meant nothing.\u201cWell yeah, it\u2019s still boring.\u201dWith that said, Kanata looked forward.At the same time, Kanata felt extreme hostility from his neighbours. He wondered if he had provoked them.Then it became time for practical exercise, and many students gathered around a few individuals, one of whom was Maria and the handsome man from earlier.\u201cFire!\u201dIt\u2019s an exercise to see if you can accurately hit the target with lower-class fire magic.Anyone can do it with little effort, but apparently, a boy from the commoner side was struggling even though he was trying his best.Even if your magic rank is high, casting and accurately releasing your magic is another matter.\u201cHow pathetic, like a commoner.\u201d\u201cHey, hey. Don\u2019t try in the first place if you\u2019re going to show such embarrassment.\u201dHe felt sorry for the boy who was about to cry at the yapping from the nobles.As a result, the boy didn\u2019t do well and became the laughing stock of the nobility.\u201cNext, Kanata-san, please.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201dKanata stepped forward as he got called.He felt the same uncomfortable stares from the noble students as before.But that still means nothing to Kanata.\u201cFire.\u201dHe muttered shortly, and a small fireball headed for the target.The scale looked too small, but it loudly exploded when it hit the target.\u201cWell done, Kanata-san. Everyone, this is how a good magic invocation is cast.\u201dKanata had no idea what to do as nobles stared at him in frustration, while commoners started with jealousy. He simply returned back to his position.It was then Maria walked beside him and said,\u201cI\u2019ve been watching you for a while now. You have got some skills.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dThe other guys would probably cry with joy, but Kanata wanted her to get away from him as soon as possible. The number of stares directed at him was unbearable.\u201c\u2026 You see.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Nevermind. I\u2019m just a little concerned about your accent.\u201d\u201cAccent?\u201d\u2014So are you saying that there is something wrong with my pronunciation?Without a second word, Maria walked away quickly. Kanata was left wondering why on earth did it bother her if he pronounced something differently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019s the b*****d who scored the top despite being a commoner.\u201d\u201cSeriously? That plain-looking guy?\u201d\u201cSo cheeky. Let\u2019s bring him somewhere the teacher can\u2019t see.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do it. Do you want to be hated by Maria-sama?\u201dAfter school, various voices reached Kanata as he walked down the hallway.It seemed like the results of the practical exercises with the court magician spread as rumours, both as good and bad ones.If Kanata had been a noble, this might have changed to admiration, but it couldn\u2019t change the noble students\u2019 attitude of looking down on the commoners no matter how much discrimination wasn\u2019t allowed in the school.(\u2026 Honestly, I\u2019m probably a better asset than you all are right now.)That\u2019s how rich he had become through donations.Kanata was going back to his dormitory to stream as usual when a thought struck him. Although he\u2019s really grateful to his audience, he can\u2019t help but wonder that since a lot of people join him, aren\u2019t maybe many of them actually a NEET?\u201cAnyway, I should hurry\u2026 Hmm?\u201dHe happened to encounter something behind the scenes.A guy and a girl were on their way somewhere. The guy was the one who scoffed at Kanata earlier, and the girl was the third princess of the kingdom, Maria.\u201cOi-oi, the princess of this kingdom is dating someone in secret? I never expected that.\u201dSince the girl is a princess, the boy must be her fianc\u00e9, or so he thought, but there might be a possibility that this was not the case. Whatever it may be, Kanata followed the two of them without being noticed.They headed for the shadow of the building, from where the boys started to speak.\u201cMaria-sama, I love you!\u201d\u201cIs this\u2026 a confession?\u201d\u201cYes! I\u2019ve always adored you! I\u2019ve been in love with you ever since I first saw you!\u201dIt seems to be a confession rather than a secret date.Kanata was impressed that he had a passionate personality, although he did not have a good image of him because of what happened earlier.However, his feelings will not get fulfilled when the other party is a princess.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I appreciate the sentiment, but I already have\u2026\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 it is.\u201dI knew it. She\u2019s got a fianc\u00e9.\u201cThere is one to whom I have given my heart. So I can\u2019t answer your feelings.\u201d\u201cIs that person\u2026 your fianc\u00e9e?\u201d\u201cFianc\u00e9? I don\u2019t have a fianc\u00e9. I\u2019m a third princess, so I got told I\u2019m free to fall in love with or marry whomever I want. I don\u2019t need a partner. I want to devote myself to a certain one already.\u201dMaria doesn\u2019t seem to have a fianc\u00e9.Kanata was surprised, not because the boy who confessed his love to her, but because he thought that a princess of her position would have a fianc\u00e9e or would marry into a neighbouring country.(\u2026 I see. I can\u2019t believe the princess has someone of that calibre she praises so much. Even though she is royalty, she doesn\u2019t take her position too seriously, takes care of commoners, and is overflowing with kindness. In addition, she is beautiful and has big b*****s, which is my favourite. I envy the person loved by such a beautiful woman. I wonder what kind of virtues that person has.)For Kanata, Maria was a favourite.It\u2019s not so much falling in love as it is simply a longing for a beautiful girl who seems to fit his taste.Kanata thinks even more so because she has the cuteness and beauty of a character from a manga or anime in his previous life.\u201cAah, it doesn\u2019t matter to me! Time for streaming then!\u201dTurning away from the confession drama, Kanata quickly returned to his dorm.He entered the room, locked the door securely and switched on the terminal on the desk as usual.[\u2026 Is today a good day to talk? I\u2019ll just talk as I go then.]He said he would stream again today, but he didn\u2019t mention at what time in particular. He was afraid people wouldn\u2019t gather as usual, but the moment he started streaming, the number of connected terminals bounced immediately, showing that people were waiting for him.[Hey you guys! It\u2019s still early in the evening, but don\u2019t you have work or something? Well, as for me, I\u2019m glad you guys are here!]That\u2019s an honest feeling, as he has said many times.Although part of him became a little bit egotistical from being famous, he still wanted this time to be enjoyable for the people who came to see him.[Today, we\u2019re gonna be chatting as usual\u2026 but hey, I\u2019m gonna be updating a few things soon! Specifically, I\u2019m thinking of a camera\u2026 Yes, a camera\u2026 so that you guys can see me in your terminals. I\u2019m not going to show my face, of course, just my hand, and that\u2019s about it.]: Nameless Princess: Haishin-sama\u2019s hands? I wonder if my eyes can stand the brilliance of his hands! Ahh, but being torched by Haishin-sama\u2019s hands would be such a pleasure\u266a.[I caught a bad one early on, but well. I\u2019ve got some stuff I want to show you, so I hope you guys are looking forward to it.]Nameless Princess reacted immediately, but Kanata went through it lightly.For other audiences, the perception of Nameless Princess as a millionaire and a bad one is the same, so they don\u2019t particularly care about her except for the first time.[Well. You know, I happened to witness a confession drama right in front of me today. They were both handsome and beautiful, and I was like, what the heck are these guys? Well, the pretty girl turned the guy down.]He immediately brought up the subject of Maria and that male student.Well, Kanata thought there was no way that Maria would be watching this stream, so I told them, and to his surprise, the comment section was very crowded. That\u2019s how many people are against good-looking people just like Kanata.: Haishin-sama, I\u2019d like to go out with you.: What did you just say? Of course, I\u2019d be the one to marry him!: No, it\u2019s me.: I feel sorry for all of you because I\u2019m the one who deserves Haishin the most.: Nameless Princess: Haa, what are these trash talking? Of course, I\u2019m the most suitable for Haishin-sama![I don\u2019t want any annoying listeners, okay? I appreciate the sentiment, but I don\u2019t like people who fight where everyone can see them~?]When Kanata said so, the comments stopped with a snap.Apparently, no one wants their Haishin-sama to hate them for behaving strangely.Now, Kanata has hit a taboo in this world in a sense here.[Anyways, I\u2019m not sure what a Demon King looks like. Does anyone know?]It was a word out of interest in the Demon King.A Demon King is the ruler of the demon race that has been enemies with humans for many years and is said to be immensely powerful. Their appearance is shrouded in mystery, and no human has ever seen the Demon King with their own eyes.[I can\u2019t wait to see if it\u2019s a big muscular guy or a beautiful woman with a nice body\u2026 Well, I\u2019ve said it many times, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re human or demon. I\u2019m the kind of guy who thinks that as long as everyone can get along without conflict, that\u2019s all that matters. Though, some people would think that I am ridiculing the struggles of our ancestors or wouldn\u2019t understand why I would even consider such a thing about the demons in the first place.]So, cutting off his words for a moment, Kanata took a drink and continued.[But think about it for a minute. Humans have things to protect, and so do demons. Of course, there are those who will follow their desires and do the utmost in tyranny, right? But I think it\u2019s the same with everyone. Some people commit crimes because they like it, and some people get pleasure from assaulting women.]In the Royal Capital, such stories are limited to people with special tastes, but you can easily hear them if you leave the capital.It is not unusual for them to raid villages, steal women, burn crops, and kill all the men. Even among humans, there are those who find pleasure in cruelty.[Well, I\u2019d like to see humans and demons getting along for the time being. Maybe it\u2019s impossible, but I\u2019d still like to see it one day. I think that if we joined hands with each other instead of fighting, we could share the good parts of humans and the good parts of demons with each other and make the world a better place.]It\u2019s only a dream. But if it becomes true, this world would become truly peaceful.: Intriguing. I knew that you were an interesting fellow, Haishin. I, too, shall look on the bright side.[Oh, you\u2019re imitating the Demon King? Good lord, please come up with a better idea!]There was no way the Demon King was watching, so Kanata went through this again quickly.However, later on, the human side unexpectedly received an offer of a temporary non-aggression pact from the demon side. It was unexpected, but from the human side, it was a proposal that made them want to nod in agreement.: Hey everyone, it happened because of Haishin, right?: What happened? \u2026 Don\u2019t tell me that the Demon King is listening to Haishin too!: Haishin\u2026 He\u2019s such a big man, without a doubt.: I mean, who in the world is he? I bet that he\u2019s the most influential person in the world.In a place Kanata didn\u2019t know, he became famous for yet another reason.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was an eternal question for both humans and demons.Nobody knows how or why it happened, but all know it has been going on for a long time.Amid such neverending conflicts, the Demon King, the ruler of the demon race, was also worried about its history.\u201cWhy do we fight? Why can\u2019t we hold hands together?\u201dSuch a question certainly arose in their mind.It felt as if something was telling him to be that way as if the world was telling them to stop questioning and become a puppet.It is as if they got barred from proposing a cease-fire, negotiating for anything, or any other action that might lead them to that point.\u201c\u2026 All we have done is fight, and we were rightful to do so.\u201dBut that didn\u2019t change anything.They continued what they had been doing until now because of the predecessors\u2019 wisdom the Demon King, the demons and humans inherited.However, it was like a shackle to their thoughts.They didn\u2019t question why it was so. They just moved under the fixed belief that it must be so\u2015 but that\u2019s when he came in.\u201cHmm? Haishin? Who is that?\u201dA subordinate who was familiar with the trends of the human world informed the Demon King of the existence of Haishin.The Demon King heard that a human being named Haishin broadcasted his voice over a vast audience, speaking whatever was on their mind and was apparently popular despite it.\u201cHe talks about some interesting things. I wonder if there are people who share this feeling. It would be fun to have him as a friend.\u201dSince there were no portable terminals like in the human world, and the subordinates were strangely impressed with Haishin, the Demon King ordered them to prepare a stationary terminal for them to use.\u201cNow, what kind of a person are you?\u201dThen the very first day the Demon King heard Haishin\u2019s voice, they knew that the man called Haishin was a completely different individual from anyone they had ever seen before, in more ways than one.And there was something about the way he spoke and what he said that attracted others.[What\u2019d you guys eat today? I had eggs on toast.]\u201cI had meat. Which was a bit spicy for the morning.\u201dEven though there was no way that Haishin could have returned the words, the Demon King naturally replied.She began listening to Haishin\u2019s voice as a way to kill time, but before she knew it, it had become a part of her daily routine.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what kind of content we have today\u2026 but how much power does this Haishin have?\u201dThe Demon King knows, of course, that the method of spreading the voice to reach all directions consumes a lot of magic power.That is why the Demon King was also wary of his magic power.It is common knowledge that SSS is the highest magic rank among humans, but the great Demon King surpasses even that as her magic power was extraordinarily high.However, having learned about Haishin, she noticed that Haishin might possess even greater magic power than them, the Demon King itself.\u201cInteresting, really interesting, Haishin.\u201dHe was not a man who was obligated to anyone, always saying only what he thought was right. He never took sides, something very appealing to the Demon King, who had different perceptions from those of human beings.And it was at this very moment when Haishin became a significant figure for the Demon King.[You know, I always wonder why humans and demons fight each other. Honestly, from my point of view, I think it\u2019s pointless to fight because it only leads to more sacrifices, and nobody ever questions it. Why?]The Demon King was so surprised that she spit the drink she was drinking on a nearby subordinate.It was a question that the Demon King had been struggling with for a long time. A question no one around them had ever thought of the answer to.\u201cWell, that being said, here\u2019s my opinion. If you\u2019re a human, a high-ranking official in your country, and on the demon side, if you\u2019re a Demon King, I guess? It would be great if the country leaders could talk to each other at a peace summit\u2026 But well, it\u2019s more important to have dinner tonight since I\u2019m getting hungry!]\u201c\u2026 Seriously, this guy.\u201dThe Demon King got taken aback but couldn\u2019t hold her laughter.For this reason, the Demon King considered Haishin a peer with whom she could exchange opinions of the same viewpoint and ask questions.\u201cHou, there\u2019s a button called Support Me.\u201d[TLN: It could be anything like Kofi, Paypal, or superchats, so it will change according to how the word gets used.]\u201cWhat does that do?\u201d\u201cHmm. Apparently, Haishin has started a feature where we can provide some support for him. This thing, called \u2018Support Me,\u2019 seems to be able to send currency.\u201dSo from that day onward, the Demon King also started sending him money like crazy.Because she was a Demon King, she had tremendous wealth, and although it was a small fortune in their terms, a Demon King\u2019s small fortune was a lot of money in the human world.[I\u2019m glad you are doing this much for me, but\u2026 Please put yourself first, okay? I know I\u2019m the one who implemented this feature, but I just feel guilty about it.]\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Haishin. It\u2019s a small fortune from my vault. I\u2019ve plenty because I am the Demon King, you know!\u201dMaybe because she had been listening to the stream for so long, she no longer acted like the Demon King but a simp who loves to throw money at him like crazy.[TLN: I\u2019ve made some adjustments, but it just says they transformed into a crazy Haishin believer.]The Demon King felt that the time she spent listening to Haishin was the happiest moment of her life, and she began to think of him as a partner she wanted by her side, who had the same perspective as she did.\u201cHaishin\u2026 Haishin, the man without a face. I desire you. I am the Demon King, a being who ravages through many things. But\u2026\u201dComplaining so\u2026 the demon king pouted, her cheeks blushed red.\u201c\u2026 If it\u2019s you, I\u2019d like you to ravage this body.\u201dThe Demon King, who had fought a hundred battles, can now also be called one of the hardcore simps in modern history.[TLN: The word used is \u30ac\u30c1\u604b\u52e2, which means people who\u2019re madly in love with the target they\u2019re cheering for.]This whole \u2018streaming(haishin)\u2019 thing was just so new to the Demon King, as she had never seen or heard of something like this before, and it is one of the reasons she was so attracted to him.He speaks honestly, and when you listen to him daily, you may even think Haishin is with you. There is nothing strange about thinking that his being was there with you.\u201cHah\u2026 Haishin, I want to see you. How can I see you? How can I see your face? How can I seek you?\u201dIn the bathroom, one too large and luxurious for one person to use, the Demon King thinks of Haishin with a melancholy expression on her face.Her long black hair that almost touches the ground, her blood-red eyes, and her huge wings are proof of her inhumanity, while her balanced, uneven body forms the beauty of a woman.\u201c\u2026 The human world, huh? Somewhere you are\u2026 But where exactly?\u201dDark-skinned, she reaches for the void.She wants to hold him in her hands, embrace him, and give him the entirety of herself. Yes, that is how much the Demon King\u2015 Shrouza, as a woman, is crazy for him.[Haishin\u2019s side]\u201c\u2026 Good! Now it\u2019s done.\u201dUnaware of the fact that such a Demon King is in love with him, Haishin had completed something.It\u2019s the magic device which will capture and show the recording of his hands that he mentioned earlier.It doesn\u2019t particularly change what he\u2019s going to talk about, but he can\u2019t wait to tell his audience that the next stream is coming with an update like this.\u201cShould I put on gloves or something? No, it\u2019s okay. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to be identified by my hands. Besides, it looks cramped!\u201dIncidentally, he didn\u2019t know that this idea would cause him lot\u2019s of trouble.Kanata has yet to fully realize this is a different world and the unusual insight of those who considered simps.Well, to begin with, he thinks he\u2019s becoming popular, but he doesn\u2019t realize how heavily he is loved.\u201cOkay, when do I start then?\u201dBeing a pesky geek himself, he knows about such people through social networking sites, but\u2026 Well, he never would\u2019ve anticipated becoming a victim of that at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Case In Which Streaming In Another World Led To The Creation Of A Massive Yandere FollowingCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 07: Third Believer, Saint AlphanaIt was a holiday that day.Basically, Kanata\u2019s days off are spent in his dorm room, but sometimes he goes outside for a change.\u201cIyaa, it\u2019s nice to take a walk on a sunny day like this.\u201dKanata muttered as he ate the special bread in his hand.Since there was nothing to do today, even if he stayed in the dormitory and the streaming started at night, Kanata went outside for a walk to eat.The characteristic bread in Kanata\u2019s hand was like a kebab he had eaten in a previous life. It had a delightful balance of just the right amount of spiciness and vegetables, and he bought it the moment he found it because he was so drawn in by the taste.\u201c\u2026 Iyaa, that\u2019s delicious. It\u2019s the best.\u201dHe finished the first one with a crunch and was about to eat the second one.\u201cHey, hey, missy. You bumped me on purpose, you know?\u201d\u201cPlease forgive me.\u201dRight in front of Kanata was a man arguing with a petite girl in a white robe.Apparently, that girl bumped into the guy, and she apologized desperately, but he was not letting her go.Kanata sighed a little at such a typical situation in the other world.\u201c\u2026 Haah. There are no guards nearby. Does this mean I\u2019m the one supposed to save her?\u201d\u201cCould it be a revelation from God?\u201d Kanata thought to himself but then laughed, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no way it\u2019d be!\u201dThe Kanata in this world was neither a warrior nor a hero. He is just a streamer.Then someone would surely appear with the role of saving her\u2026 Well, it was impossible for Kanata to do nothing about the troubled, beautiful girl he could see even from a distance.\u201cDon\u2019t be so cocky, old man. It was just a bump. And don\u2019t tell me that you got broken bones just because this girl ran a little fast?\u201dHe intervened between the girl and the man.\u201cWho the h**l are you, little s**t?\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201dThe girl looked at Kanata with a blank stare, regardless of the man\u2019s reaction. Kanata felt a little uncomfortable as if he had missed something, but he decided to do what he had set out to do; to help her.\u201cLet\u2019s just get this over with, old man.\u201d\u201cHa?\u201dKanata put magic in his palm and pulled the man\u2019s hand away from the girl.Kanata wasn\u2019t physically strong, but he could become much stronger just by channelling the magical power into him.The man, perhaps feeling that he had a disadvantage over Kanata, said a few harsh words and walked away.\u201cDamn, she could\u2019ve at least apologized\u2026 right, young lady?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t know her name, and her body was quite small, so calling her young lady didn\u2019t seem that far off.Kanata could not identify her figure due to the draped robe, but he assumed that the slight protrusion around her chest area was a characteristic of her clothing.Now, although he saved her, she kept staring at Kanata.Kanata was unsure what to do with her gaze that seemed to hold something mysterious.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah, nothing\u2026 I just found your voice familiar.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dThen Kanata wondered if it was possible.Kanata had become reasonably well known in this world as Haishin. So he wondered if his voice as Haishin had overlapped with his own.(She just found my voice familiar, so there isn\u2019t any problem. But wait, is romance possible with a girl as cute as her if I were to expose myself a little?)He\u2019s old enough to imagine such things, of course.Well, that is just a reflection of Haishin\u2019s popularity. It did not mean that she had feelings for Kanata herself.Thinking about that, Kanata dropped his smile.\u201cSo, now that this is over, can I go? I don\u2019t think he\u2019s coming back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine! I could have fought him off by myself, but I was afraid that using too much force might injure him!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah, so you\u2019re of that type.\u201dApparently, he didn\u2019t have to help.But then Kanata looked at the girl again.She was wearing a drab robe and a veil of sorts, but her beautiful silver hair sparkled as it reflected the sunlight.Her sky-blue eyes looked as beautiful as jewels, and such beauty seemed to represent her pure heart.\u201cWhat type? I am not sure, but I can feel your kindness. Thank you, the Nameless One.\u201d\u201cNo, no. I mean, it\u2019s fine because it feels good to help a beautiful girl.\u201d\u201dFufu, beautiful girl, you say? I think Third Princess Maria is much more beautiful than I am.\u201dWell, her level is too high for him to begin with.She is a beauty that Kanata would never have encountered in his previous life\u2026 or even existed in that world.\u201c\u2026 As expected of a fantasy world.\u201d\u201c??\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dKanata scratched his head as if he was fooling around.At that moment, the girl gasped. She turned her eyes to the back of Kanata\u2019s hand.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\u201cEh? Oh, this.\u201dOn the back of his hand was a magic item used to heal wounds, similar to a poultice.In fact, when he was rearranging his room last night, something heavy fell on his hand.So this morning, the swelling hadn\u2019t gone down, so he was wearing this pain-relieving item.\u201cWell, maybe tomorrow I\u2019ll be better.\u201d\u201cI see. I hope you take care of yourself?\u201d\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re such a sweet young lady.\u201dHe was almost in tears at the girl\u2019s kindness.It was over the top, but Kanata stroked the head of a girl he thought was younger than him, but he immediately thought it was a bad idea and withdrew his hand.\u201cOops. Sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Umm~ Perhaps you think I\u2019m younger than you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh? Are you not?\u201d\u201cI may indeed be younger than you, but you have the atmosphere of the same age group that I often see. I actually turned seventeen this year.\u201d\u201c\u2026 We\u2019re the same.\u201dHe didn\u2019t expect such a little girl to be his age.Kanata\u2019s height is about 170 cm, and the girl is probably less than 150 cm, so there was quite a difference between the two.[EDN: For imperial system people, 170 cm = 5\u2032 7\u2033, 150 cm = 4\u2032 11\u2033]\u201c\u2026 My bad!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s totally fine. I\u2019m often told that I\u2019m short compared to my age group. But my body is mature, you know?\u201d\u201cHeh?\u201dSo she puffed up a bit of her chest.There, Kanata saw an overwhelming bulge that didn\u2019t fit her small figure, and he froze for a moment but quickly looked away.\u201dFufu, I can also make adult-like gestures \u266a.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dApparently, she may have a better personality than Kanata thought.But then she looked down a little and blurted out something. It was loud enough to be firmly conveyed to Kanata.\u201cI cleanse my body every day so that one day I can give it all to the One.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Fufu, it\u2019s nothing. Well then, kind-hearted person, I\u2019ll see you again when I have the chance.\u201d\u201cOu. See you then.\u201dSo they exchanged words, and Kanata parted with her.Incidentally, he saw a cross-like accessory dangling from her neck when she shifted her robe off her chest.Kanata stared at her, thinking that perhaps she was quite special since he knew that people who carry something reminiscent of a cross on their bodies are basically those who stand in a special position.\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter. I should go home.\u201dHe returns to the dormitory with a relieved look on his face feeling happy about his encounter with the beautiful girl.[Saint\u2019s side]\u201cWelcome home, Saint-sama.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201dShe passed through the door of a building located on a vast site at a corner of the royal city of Sistol.That girl was the girl Kanata had met in the city, and she was also the one who was now called a saint.The Saint is an indispensable presence in the kingdom, and with her vast magical powers, she also appears in negotiations with other countries.However, since she hides her face when she appears in public, only a few people know that this girl is a saint.\u201c\u2026 It was a good encounter. He seemed kind\u2026 and I thought his voice sounded very similar. I thought it was impossible, but enough to make me wonder if it might be possible.\u201dNow, he started giving off some suspicious vibes in her mind.She sat down in her chair, booted up her terminal, and opened a certain file.[Well. Let\u2019s read today\u2019s messages.]\u201cKyaaaa, Haishin-samaaaaaa\u266a!\u201d\u2026 Yes, she was called a saint, but she was also a girl who had been tainted by the secular world.There were several reasons why she had come to know Haishin and why she had gone so crazy, but the most important was that she was too pure.She simply liked Haishin\u2019s voice itself.\u201cYou have such a beautiful voice\u2026 haa-haa.\u201dThe sight of her snorting, no doubt, is so shocking that those who know her might faint from the sight of it.\u201cWhy do you have such a lovely voice, Haishin-sama? That voice that makes my lower abdomen quiver with excitement\u2026 You\u2019re making me want to have a baby with your voice!\u201dHer face was bright red as she twisted and turned, and she looked completely dangerous to both those who knew her and those who did not.But in such madness, she learned her fate that night.[Ta-da~ Now you guys can see my hands! Are you guys watching?]\u201cHis hands\u2026 wait?\u201dShe didn\u2019t expect to see Haisin\u2019s hand, and when she dove into the screen, she saw it. On Haishin\u2019s hand, there was something like a poultice on it.\u201c\u2026 No way\u2026 No way, no way, no way!\u201dSaint Alphana, the very first thing that popped into her mind was the man she met on the street.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Case In Which Streaming In Another World Led To The Creation Of A Massive Yandere FollowingCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 08: The world of the internet is scary\u201cCan you guys see it properly? Actually, I am checking over from my side, and it looks pretty good to me.\u201dKanata made a new attempt to stream a video showing his hand for the first time today.He was checking the video from a second spare terminal, different from the one he was streaming from, and to his surprise, the quality was really something.(The swelling hasn\u2019t gone down yet, so I\u2019m putting this on, but it doesn\u2019t look cool. Well, that\u2019s my fault for s******g up this morning.)[TLN: Actually, should it be last night?]The poultice he put on the back of his hand to make the swelling go down faster was very noticeable.Some of the comments he received from the audience were crazy about the fact that he was live streaming his hands, while others were concerned about his injury.[I messed up a little this morning. Everyone, be careful with what you put on the shelves and stuff.]That was enough to let people know what had happened, and many wished him well.Now that the streaming has started, not much more was mentioned about this matter.Thus it was time to read the messages.[I\u2019ll be introducing some of my favourite and tastiest foods in the near future. As usual, here goes today\u2019s message.]Kanata was feeling better than usual, having succeeded in streaming his hand.The best evidence for this was the liveliness in his voice, which was easily noticeable to the listeners.: W-wow, so this is Haishin-sama\u2019s hand!: \u2026 Haishin, let me hold it.: Please wait for me, Haishin-sama. I will be by your side in the near future![You guys are too excited just from seeing my hands. Oh well, here\u2019s the first message!]While ignoring the people who reacted as usual in a sickening manner, Kanata read out the first message he got first.[Erm, what is it\u2026][Haishin-sama! I apologize for the abruptness of this message. I really wanted to get your advice, so I sent this.I am from the Principality of Randall, and I fear that my friend may get executed in a few days.][Oi-oi, that\u2019s a serious matter!]It was quite a disturbing first message.The Principality of Randall is a country with a long history, although not as long as Sistol\u2019s. They also possess quite a large landmass and are advanced in magic equipment manufacturing.Kanata, of course, has never been there, but Sistol and Randall are considered important countries with close trade relations inseparable from each other.[To give you some details, that friend of mine is engaged to the son of a rather prestigious family. My friend is not the type of girl who stands out much and is not that assertive, but she\u2019s a very good girl and always worked hard for her fianc\u00e9e.]The text showed how much this sender cared about her friend.Kanata was serious, but the audience was quieter than usual because of the content.[However, such a girl got suddenly imprisoned for a crime that never happened. They said she tried to kill her sister, which is ridiculous, and now she\u2019s\u2026I protested that it was impossible, that there was some mistake, but no one would listen to me.They only seemed to believe her sister\u2019s words and refused to listen to anything I had to say!][I see what you mean.]There was still a bit of writing, but he stopped reading there.[If I\u2019m not wrong, quite a few people from the Principality watch this stream, right?]The comments section buzzed slightly after he asked.He saw a lot of messages from a lot of people saying they lived in the Principality, and some knew about the commotion.[If there are any higher-ups in the Principality listening, hold off on that execution for now. Well. I\u2019m an outsider, and I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on, but I\u2019d like you to stop and think for a minute and try what I\u2019m about to tell you.]In all honesty, this situation was unravelling similarly to a story Kanata had read in a web novel in his previous life.It\u2019s a story about someone with some mysterious power that makes up a story to humiliate someone in particular and then has them executed for their crimes.[The first thing I want you to do is to find out if anyone on her side is under some enchantment spell or something else. Then, thoroughly check the sister to see if she has any special abilities.]Kanata guessed that she was probably using some sort of charm-type magic.If it\u2019s not magic, although rare, there is a possibility that it could be a case involving a demon eye.[Though many of you do not know, there are things like demon eyes in this world! If you think my words are ridiculous, then, by all means, try to look into it. Ah. I mean, you can approach Sistol for that sort of thing? If you can, by all means, let me know. Maybe we can save an innocent life.]: I\u2019ll take care of it, Haishin-sama!: I\u2019ll send the instructions right away!He saw something that caught his attention in the comments flowing at high speed but decided to let it pass for now.He doesn\u2019t know how this case will turn out, but from Kanata\u2019s point of view, there is nothing more he can do for now.[I hope it all works out for the best. Let\u2019s move on.]However, Kanata secretly thought it wasn\u2019t a bad idea to convey something like this in response to a crisis.Well, the following message was\u2026Kanata hesitated for a moment.[Oh, come on, this isn\u2019t a letter, it\u2019s a threat, you know?]As he said, the contents of the letter he saw were threats against Kanata.[Yo Haishin, I\u2019m Kamakiri, someone who rules the band of thieves named Guilmes.I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll livestream this, but you\u2019re getting too high lately, and that pisses me off.People like you make me sick. I swear I will find you and kill you.Go sleep and shiver to death, you sonovabetch.][You are the fukeng sonovabetch.]It\u2019s probably jealousy, or maybe he was merely abhorred by Kanata\u2019s existence.Just as Kanata spoke, a huge amount of money was donated to him.There are still a certain number of people who didn\u2019t like it.[You shouldn\u2019t send threats like this, you know? If this were back in the day, people would identify you and shove you in a pigsty.]He went through that letter lightly, thinking it would only be words, after all.But this fool had no idea what would happen to him now that he had said he was planning to kill their beloved Haishin, even if it was supposed to be a prank.He was about to face a gruesome judgment by the beings who worshiped Haishin as a god.***In a place with noticeable signs of life at the end of a cave, many men were laying down on the floor.A burly man ran out of the cave as if to escape.\u201cS**t! Why the h**l are those people even coming to this place!? What\u2019s with that, \u2018for Haishin-sama\u2019? It\u2019s so creepy!\u201dThe man\u2019s name was Kamakiri, and he was the one who had sent threats to Haishin the previous day.As usual, he was in the cave with his friends deciding on their next target when they got attacked in what could be called a surprise attack.It is not unusual for bandits like the Kamakiri to get ambushed, but this time it was completely unexpected, and there were just too many of them.\u201cF**k! F**k, f**k, f**k, f**k! This is all because of that m**********r!\u201dThe instant he said that Kamakiri felt a sharp pain in his leg and fell down on the spot.He looked at his foot, which was in great pain, but his foot was nowhere to be found.\u201cSeriously, don\u2019t make me have to do this again.\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s nothing but a hassle.\u201dThere was a handsome man carrying a sword, a tall woman in a white robe, and a winged demon looking down at Kamakiri from the sky.\u201cYare-yare, if humans are going to take care of things, I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to be involved in this.\u201dThe winged demon had yet to show himself, but Kamakiri knew he was surrounded by three people.Who were they really? The answer is simple. They were Maria, Alphana, and Shrouza\u2019s subordinates, respectively.It all started when Kamakiri revealed he was planning to kill Haishin in yesterday\u2019s stream, which led to this tragedy.\u201cKilling Haishin-sama? There sure are some irredeemable idiots in this world.\u201d\u201cIndeed. The saint tried to come in person, but I requested her to leave this matter to me.\u201d\u2026 Well, it was no wonder because they were also the followers of Haishin.They were lesser simps (soft believers) than Maria, Alphana, and Shrouza, but they were mad enough to make immediate judgments like this.The truth is that Maria, Alphana, and Shrouza were about to purge the bandits in person, but that would have been a bad idea, so they sent their subordinates instead.From the man\u2019s point of view, it was a self-inflicted and unfortunate incident, but it taught him a lesson that the online world is still a scary place.He didn\u2019t live to tell the tale, however.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was foolish to have someone like you as my fianc\u00e9e.\u201dLisa has had a fianc\u00e9e since she was young.The man was the son of a great nobleman with a more respectable history than her own family, and even though she felt she was not fit for him, Lisa desperately tried in her own way to live up to her family\u2019s expectations and to be accepted by him as much as possible.However, as if to ridicule her efforts, a tragedy occurred.\u201cNothing gives me more pleasure than to make your sister miserable, don\u2019t you think so? Watching a concubine\u2019s daughter be loved more than her sister, a main wife\u2019s daughter!\u201dWhen she was a child, her father brought home a pretty girl. She was far more fanciful and brilliant than plain-looking Lisa.Anna, her step-sister, was a crybaby, but Lisa always tried her best to be her big sister.After sixteen years of trying, the day before yesterday, Lisa was thrown in jail for trying to kill her sister in a state of incomprehension.\u201cThe guilty must get punished. You are guilty of a serious crime, for you tried to lay your hands on my beloved Anna. I will have you executed at once.\u201dLisa couldn\u2019t say anything back to him as she was just stunned.She hated herself for being unable to say anything and just kept shedding tears while stuck in this situation.At the same time, she let resentment grow in her heart to the point where her fingernails dug into her skin, causing her to start bleeding.\u2018If there is a next life, I will surely take revenge on you\u2026\u2019By that time, the cloud of resentment had already taken over her heart, and she would never forget the hatred.\u201cLisa! Hang in there a little longer. I\u2019m here with you. Everything will be fine!\u201dHer friend came to see Lisa every day.She was the only one who supported Lisa in this situation where she had no one to trust.She said she would seek help from someone she blindly believed in, Haishin, but unfortunately, Lisa had no interest in him, and she was only familiar with his name. She did not know much about him.But soon, those days of clinging to despair and a little hope came to an end.It was as usual.Her hateful little sister appeared in front of her prison cell with a mocking expression.\u201cYa-ho~ Onee-sama. How does the cold ground feel?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Anna.\u201d\u201cKufufu! You look great, onee-sama. So ungraceful\u2026 so ugly. But it feels so good! It\u2019s the kind of look a shabby woman like you deserves.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dUnlike Anna and her beautiful dress, Lisa\u2019s clothes were in tatters, appropriate for a prisoner. Even now, it was too cold to sleep at night.\u201cYou ain\u2019t going to say anything? Ahaha! I know it\u2019s because you can\u2019t say anything to a noble like me! But don\u2019t worry, it will all be over soon. Your execution will save you from this agony.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t be stupid! It\u2019s all\u2026 your fault!\u201dThe things that accumulated up to now come out in the form of words, but no matter how much she shouted, it only pleased Anna.\u201cWell then, Onee-sama, let\u2019s meet again at the scaffold, shall we?\u201dWith an ugly smile, she walked away\u2026 as always.But then the door leading to the prison, where only two people were supposed to be, opened with a loud noise, and someone entered.\u201cAra\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dTwo people appeared. They were the diplomats from the royal city of Sistol stationed in the Principality.They looked at Anna\u2026 and then at Lisa, and nodded to each other and opened their mouths to say this.\u201cMiss Lisa, your execution has been called off for the time being.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHaa..?\u201dAs Lisa and Anna were surprised, one of the diplomats took the key and unlocked Lisa\u2019s prison cell.\u201cCan you stand up?\u201d\u201cY-yes\u2026\u201dLisa wondered if this was all staged by Anna, but the stunned look on Anna\u2019s face told her it wasn\u2019t.Unsure of what was going on, Lisa was dressed in warm clothes and ate her first proper meal in a long time to fill her empty stomach.\u201c\u2026 Delicious, so delicious\u2026 I can\u2019t hold it anymore\u2026!\u201dAnd then she cried, as those were the tears she hadn\u2019t shed in a long time.Her tears had dried up from despair, but she was happy to get back to her normal life.She hadn\u2019t met her family, her fianc\u00e9e, or her sister yet, but Lisa never wanted to see any of them ever again.\u201cMiss Lisa, may I?\u201dThen that diplomat appears at her doorstep.And the fact that she heard was a shock to Lisa.\u201cAnna has a demon eye\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dWhat a surprise, Anna seems to possess demon eyes.A mesmerizing demon eye can make others lose their perception, manipulate them at will, and make them prisoners to their own will.\u201cIt is said that demon eyes can manifest at any time. However, it is unforgivable to try to have someone with it executed. She would have normally been the one executed instead, but since your father protected her, Miss Anna will be released on the condition that she loses her eyes and gets placed under house arrest.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dHow much pain does it really entail to have their eyes carved?However, Lisa was somewhat pleased for Anna to be in such a state. It was a shame she wouldn\u2019t get executed, but she\u2019ll never see the light again and won\u2019t be able to go outside\u2026 because she\u2019ll have to suffer that pain until the day she dies.\u201c\u2026 Hehe.\u201dShe felt bad for laughing at that woman.But that was to be expected, considering what she had done to her.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t help you sooner, and we didn\u2019t even know you were in that state because it was a national issue.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s given.\u201dThen the diplomat explained how Lisa got saved.\u201cIt all started when a friend of Miss Lisa\u2019s told Haishin-sama about it.\u201d\u201cHaishin\u2026sama?\u201dThe diplomat\u2019s appearance became slightly suspicious, and she spoke as if on cloud nine.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. In order to resolve the situation regarding Miss Lisa, Haishin-sama raised the issue. Soon, in response to his call, Princess Maria, Saint Alphana, and many others took the lead in this unprecedented decision.\u201d\u201cHa, haa\u2026\u201dI see\u2026 How is that even possible? Lisa was still unable to grasp the whole situation.The diplomat\u2019s appearance became more and more heated, and it was clear how much importance she placed on Haishin\u2019s existence.It was like watching a friend who couldn\u2019t stop talking about their favourite character from a movie.\u201cAfter all, Haishin-sama is so wonderful\u2026 so amazing! To think that even in such a distant country, Haishin-sama\u2019s influence is so great\u2026 Ah, what is this feeling? I\u2019ll have to spend the rest of my life following him! I must witness Haishin-sama\u2019s accomplishments, no matter how far and wide it goes!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was a really crazy look on her face.But Lisa was not expecting this at all.That figure was going to be her future self.She does not yet know that she will become a fervent believer in him who saved her life and changed her destiny of death beyond the boundaries of the countries, to the point that even her friend will become mortified.***Well, it was some time after the matter got settled in Principality.Kanata went to the academy, as usual, sometimes spending his time being annoyed by the noble students and sometimes being looked at with jealousy by other commoner students.\u201cHey, wasn\u2019t it kind of hectic today?\u201d\u201cI guess so. I don\u2019t know why the teachers are in some meeting\u2026\u201dSuch words reached his ears as he plopped down at his desk, but he wasn\u2019t particularly interested in them, so he didn\u2019t think to ask.As he was doing so, his homeroom teacher came in with a tired look on her face.\u201cAh~\u2026 Good morning, everyone. There\u2019s a new person joining our class for a while starting today.\u201dThe classroom erupted at his words.Kanata even wakes up his body because it is rare.He had never revealed his true face to the world before, but he decided not to in consideration of his future.\u201cHowever, the person is an important figure in our kingdom and is also a close friend of Princess Maria. In other words, she has a close relationship with the royal family. She has never shown her face in public before, but she has decided to do so from now on for the sake of her future.\u201dIt seemed that someone in a rather dastardly position was joining this class, and immediately, the atmosphere became tense.The teacher gave the signal, and a girl entered the classroom.The girl was so beautiful that both boys and girls were fascinated by her.\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201dHowever, Kanata was the only one amongst them who showed surprise towards the girl.She\u2019s a short girl, but her violent style is a sight for the eyes, and it seems the top of her uniform shakes every time she walks.\u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Alphana. Though I am still young, I am ordained as a saint.\u201dSaint. The words startled everyone in the class.Especially when it comes to Kanata, he can\u2019t help but stare at her in disbelief.The girl called Alphana was the same girl Kanata once met on the street.However, there seems to be\u2026 a lot of speculation as to why someone like her is in his class.[Postscript]I think Alphana is cute.She is a strong lady of action.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: One heck of an exaggerated interpretation!When it became known to the public that Saint Alphana transferred to the Royal Academy, the entirety of the school was in chaos.She was surrounded by all kinds of students, not only those from S class but also from other classes, who had come only to catch a glimpse of the Saint\u2019s face.\u201cLady Saint, I\u2019ve been wanting to meet you for once in a lifetime!\u201d\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d\u201cSaint-sama! Why did you choose this academy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to say it\u2019s a social experience\u2026 but with a purpose.\u201dApparently, the bombardment of new students with questions is no different in any world.In the midst of all this, Kanata never bothered to approach the Lady Saint. Instead, he stayed in his seat, thinking.(\u2026 So she\u2019s a saint, huh? One of the most important positions in the kingdom. So she is a person with authority on par with the royal family?)For Kanata, his knowledge of the so-called saints is no more than that of a bystander.From what he knows, a saint is an existence selected once every few decades, depending on their unusual magical powers and suitability as a saint.Despite her young age, she has the authority to run the church with ease, and furthermore, she is also involved in diplomacy, as she has close ties to the royal family.\u201c\u2026 I never thought I\u2019d see that girl again.\u201dKanata now knew why she said back then that she could easily fend off the man with force if she wanted to.Also, he was secretly scared that he might get accused of disrespect for patting her on the head, though she did not take any action against Kanata.\u201cWell, she must\u2019ve forgotten my face by now. As you can see, I\u2019m just a regular guy around here.\u201dKanata looked away from Alphana, thinking it was no longer his concern.However, it became bothersome to see so many students, especially from the nobility, approaching her like that.Maria, who was said to be her friend, was absent today because of official work, and there was no one here who was truly her equal.\u201cLady Alphana, I am Zektor, second son of Randall Family\u2014\u201dThe moment the long-haired noble student mentioned Alphana\u2019s name, something changed.\u201cCould you please not call me by my name without my permission?\u201d\u201cF-forgive me for my rudeness.\u201dZektor immediately lowered his head at Alphana\u2019s clear refusal.Not only Kanata but also the oppressed commoner students laughed at the pitiful appearance of the aristocrat, who was always overbearing toward Kanata and the other commoners.Of course, it would be troublesome if she noticed them, so they only laughed in their mind.\u201cBut still, why the S class?\u201dThat was the question.Not to be compared to Kanata, who possesses limitless magic powers, Alphana\u2019s magic power is said to be so enormous, on par with or greater than Maria\u2019s.That being the case, one would expect her to get assigned to the SSS class instead of the S class, but in the end, Kanata, a mere student, had no way of knowing the truth.\u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to get involved in this. So what shall I talk about today?\u201dMuttering so, Kanata started thinking about the content of today\u2019s streaming.Even though the Saint joined their class, there was no change in the lecture content and practical training.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u201cWater Slash.\u201dIt was a demonstration of magic, where Alphana showed off her abilities.Although the magic she used was simple enough for Kanata and the others to learn at this stage, it was so different in power and intensity that the object that served as the target got torn to shreds.\u201cAs expected of the Lady Saint.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s so amazing\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 There\u2019s no way I can get close to her if she\u2019s this strong.\u201dKanata thought, \u2018You should concentrate on yourself instead of worrying about such things,\u2019 which was normal for him, but not so from the aristocrats\u2019 point of view, it seemed.After all, becoming close to someone like Alphana would become a great contribution to their house and an incredible personal achievement. That\u2019s why they were so devastated.\u201cNext, Kanata-san, please.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dKanata also stood in front of the target as the teacher called him.At that moment, when he passed Alphana by switching places, she blurted out,\u201cI\u2019ll be cheering for you, kind-hearted one.\u201d\u201cEhh?\u201d\u201cUfufu \u266a.\u201d\u2026 Apparently, she remembered Kanata.Perhaps she was thinking about the possibility of receiving criticism from other students if she had a conversation with Kanata in a place where they were being publicly watched.Kanata\u2019s cheeks relaxed as he did not expect to hear that from her again, the kind-hearted one.\u201cWater Slash.\u201dHe fired a water blade at the target. It hit cleanly, though not at Alphana\u2019s level.The teacher nodded in satisfaction at the perfection of his magic as usual, which he had limited and tried to make look as bland as possible.However, only the teachers were happy, while the students were not.\u201cDamn\u2026 cocky as ever.\u201d\u201cFor him to be a filthy commoner.\u201d\u201cWhat does he think he is?\u201dThe atmosphere around Kanata deteriorates whenever he performs well.A normal person would not be able to tolerate such an abusive atmosphere, but too bad for them, Kanata does not have the temperament to be swayed by such words.\u2018Say whatever you want.\u2019 Thinking so, he was about to return to where he was when he heard Alphana\u2019s cool voice resounding.\u201c\u2019Filthy commoner,\u2019 who said that?\u201dHer voice sounded like it dripped in quiet anger.Kanata turned to look at Alphana, as she was looking at the others with a gaze so piercing that he couldn\u2019t imagine it coming from her cutesy face.\u201cThe magic that he just demonstrated was so wonderful. Unlike me, who used force to make things happen, his magic was precise to the extreme\u2026 a work of art. Ahm, it seems even I had a lot to learn from him.\u201dAlphana\u2019s praise didn\u2019t stop there.It was a little exhilarating to see the expressions on the faces of those who spoke ill of Kanata getting progressively worse every time she praised him.\u201cIn this academy\u2026 No. No one is qualified to say such things to anyone because they\u2019re of higher status. Nobles by no means are special such that they can abuse commoners\u2026 I never expected to see such a scene when I came to this academy\u2014 have some shame on you!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe nobles didn\u2019t say anything to Kanata anymore.But from how they bit their lips, it looked like they were suppressing a fit of anger that had nowhere else to go. Apparently, regardless of what Alphana was saying to them, it all converted into anger toward Kanata.\u201cHow much do they hate me?\u201dKanata muttered like it was someone else\u2019s problem.The magic exercise continued without problems, and Kanata never spoke to Alphana again after it.But the opportunity to talk to her comes at an unexpected moment.\u201cHey you guys, sorry to keep you waiting!\u201d\u00a0[Kanata]\u201cHey, guys, let\u2019s get started.\u201d\u00a0[Kanata]\u201cWe\u2019re doing it again today, you guys!\u201d\u00a0[Kanata]It was when Kanata was practicing for what he would say at the beginning of his stream.He sensed a presence approaching and turned his attention to see who it was. Kanata was surprised to see Alphana and wondered why she was there.\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know you were here before me. I found this place on my way to explore the academy\u2026 Fufu \u266a. Good to see you again, kind-hearted one.\u201dShe said this with a beautiful smile.She approached him with a friendly smile and showed no wariness toward Kanata.Well, Kanata had no intention of doing anything to her, and since he was the one who helped her, he agreed that there was nothing strange about it.\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026 You\u2019re the young lady from back then, right?\u201dThe other party is a saint, someone equal to Maria, so he must be respectful.Nodding at Kanata\u2019s words, she returned the words with a slightly disgruntled look on her face.\u201cThat\u2019s right. But there is no need for honorifics, so please be just like you were back then. I can\u2019t help being formal around the public because this is like a custom of mine, but I would like you to be normal to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Really? Then I\u2019ll just talk as usual.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Thanks!\u201dKanata stopped using honorifics then.However, it would be a disaster if he was seen alone with one of the most important people in the kingdom, the Saint, or so he thought.Fortunately, there were no people around, but Kanata was still a little worried.Whether she knew of Kanata\u2019s anxiety or not, Alphana even went further and said the following,\u201cI have the information about the class members in mind, but if you don\u2019t mind, may I call you Kanata-sama? And please call me Alphana by all means.\u201d\u201cEh? Is it good? You looked like you didn\u2019t like it when someone called your name earlier.\u201dKanata asked as he had seen the scene earlier, and she nodded with a laugh.\u201cI would like you to call me by name. I know that you are a very kind person because of our encounter. Now that we have met again, will you please do me such a favour?\u201dAlthough he was certainly unwilling to do so, he couldn\u2019t help but nod his head when such a beautiful girl insisted so much.Despite remaining a bit puzzled, Kanata called Alphana\u2019s name.\u201c\u2026 Alphana?\u201d\u201cFuwa\u2026 yes. Kanata-sama.\u201dHe wondered why Alphana looked strangely entranced, but this was how he got involved with the Saint.(She sure is so cute\u2026 She\u2019s got a great personality and a naughty body, too perfect, right?)(Now that he has called me by my name, it means that he has already given his consent to conclude our marriage, right?)For one reason or another, hardcore simps tend to exaggerate. It was no wonder Kanata was oblivious to this.There is no way he would notice that the Saint had such a desire hidden inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: Once again, another troublesome one to the listThe day after Kanata made such a bond with Alphana, an unexpected partner for Kanata, Maria, who was supposed to be in SSS class, came to the S class for a visit.\u201cStill, I\u2019m surprised at your sudden arrival, Alphana.\u201d\u201cFufu, I\u2019m sorry, Maria. I just really wanted to get a feel of the academy, and\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dApparently, even for Maria, the Princess, Alphana\u2019s transfer was unexpected, which caused her to ask a lot of questions.Regardless of the circumstances, the sight of the kingdom\u2019s most treasured jewel, the Princess, and the Saint, someone shrouded in mystery, standing side by side was a spectacle of beauty.(\u2026 Idols?)Kanata muttered in his mind at a place far away from those two.Kanata\u2019s surroundings were also the same, staring at the two of them.\u201c\u2026 So blissful.\u201d\u201cHow pretty\u2026\u201d\u201cSomeone pinch me quickly\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t even get near them because of such radiance\u2026\u201d\u201cI understand. I really want to talk to them\u2026\u201dThe two who were at the center of attention did not mind it since they were the princess and a saint. They must have been exposed to many eyes fairly often.Perhaps it is because they have a certain amount of exposure to public appearances and speaking that they are able to maintain such a collected demeanour.(\u2026 Well, they don\u2019t seem to be interested in the surroundings at all.)It was just Kanata\u2019s own opinion.Both Maria and Alphana responded when spoken to, but their expressions showed a lack of interest.It made Kanata wonder if the smile Alphana had shown yesterday had been an illusion.(Alphana is very considerate of me, and she doesn\u2019t talk to me in the classroom.)She gave him permission to call her by name, but that didn\u2019t mean she would talk to him in public.Sometimes when their eyes met, she smiled at him, and although she looked so involved in the conversation, in reality, she was mostly thinking about Kanata.The sense of discrimination against the commoners remains deep-rooted, and no matter how good the administration is, it is difficult to deal with the unseen. That is why we can only imagine what will happen when she, a saint, speaks to Kanata, a commoner.\u201c\u2026 Well, whatever.\u201dBut even so, Kanata wasn\u2019t bothered by it.Isolated, helpless and with no friends, and even more so\u2026 He was a little sad, but Kanata had streaming to do.Nobody knows his face, not even his name, but as long as he has many fans, Kanata has no reason to be sad\u2026\u201cSad\u2026 Yoshi! I\u2019d make a friend or two myself.\u201dKanata turned her body behind them with such enthusiasm.Sitting there was a fellow commoner, a student who was often jealous of Kanata in magic training.\u201cYo, what did you eat last night?\u201d\u201cHa! You\u2019re so loud.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was Kanata\u2019s defeat.Kanata quickly looked forward and plopped down on his desk, and decided that he would let all of his followers comfort him for that day.\u201cHey, hey, I heard he\u2019s here again.\u201d\u201cAah, I get it. You mean that Raven, right?\u201d\u201cQuite scary, you know\u2026 I believe he was last seen in Mithras, which is pretty close.\u201d\u201cWell, he\u2019s not coming this way, right?\u201dThe girls were having such a conversation at a seat near Kanata.Kanata was also thinking about that story while pretending to sleep.(Raven\u2026 Isn\u2019t that the name of a bird?)In Kanata\u2019s previous life, there were birds called ravens, but \u2018raven,\u2019 as it got called in this world, is not the name of a bird.It was the name of an assassin whose stronghold was a city in the Xandard Empire, a country far to the east of Sistol\u2019s royal city, where Kanata usually spends his time.(Raven\u2026 A Legendary assassin, huh? And Mithras is about a hundred kilometres from here.)[EDN: 62 miles.]The city of Mithras that the girls mentioned is only about a hundred kilometres from here, but apparently, that was where the legendary assassin appeared.They dressed in a black robe, their gender unknown, and everything about them was shrouded in mystery.It\u2019s said that Raven would kill any opponent as long as they got paid.\u201cWill we also be killed if we get targeted?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not that famous, you know?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. Besides, I heard that Raven doesn\u2019t mess with bigwigs.\u201dThe assassinations that Raven basically undertakes are up to a certain status.That\u2019s why the Raven is also a great criminal. The fact they hadn\u2019t gotten caught so far only shows their skill in their work.(\u2026 Well, it\u2019s none of my business.)Kanata thought that no matter how much the other party was a legendary assassin, it didn\u2019t matter to him.Kanata had also become quite famous as a Haishin, but that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t expect to be targeted by assassins.It\u2019s simply not realistic. Even if he was a target, it was impossible for them to find out that Kanata was actually Haishin, so he wasn\u2019t that worried.\u201cMaybe I should sleep for a while.\u201dKanata decided to sleep as there was still some time before the teacher arrived.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In the Xandard Empire, somewhere in a mansion, there was a nobleman facing a black-robed figure.On the table between them was a tremendous amount of gold coins, a pile of gold coins that would be enough for several decades of luxury.\u201cRaven, I have a request.\u201dThe burly nobleman said to the black-robed figure, Raven.\u201cShall be done. What should I do?\u201dIt was a neutral voice coming from inside the mask.Yes, this was the legendary assassin, Raven, who came to this nobleman to accept the request.\u201cWell, don\u2019t be in such a hurry. Still\u2026 I see, so you are the legend. You look quite impressive.\u201d\u201cStop with the flattery. Just tell me what you have to say. I don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d\u201cYou b*****d\u2026 to a noble like me, you\u2014\u201dAt that moment, and with blinding speed, Raven put his hand on his sword. The clattering noise caused the nobleman to tremble uncontrollably, and he began to speak about his business in a hurry because he understood.\u201cI want you to kill a certain person. His existence is an abomination that distorts our country\u2019s system.\u201d\u201cHou, is he that big of a deal?\u201d\u201cYeah. That man\u2019s name is Haishin.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHaishin. The moment he mentioned that name, Raven stopped saying anything.While tilting his head at the situation, the nobleman spoke one by one about the movement set in motion by Haishin\u2019s words as if to vent his resentment.\u201cOkay, I get the point.\u201d\u201cI see. There\u2019s no time limit since no one knows his real name and face. There\u2019s nothing we can do about it, but for God\u2019s sake, Raven, this is an advance, and you can keep it.\u201dWith that, the noble turned away, but Raven opened his mouth to stop the noble.\u201cI don\u2019t want any money upfront.\u201d\u201cHuh? Do you want it after work? That\u2019s very optimistic.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s because I can\u2019t accept this request in the first place.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What?\u201dAnd the very next moment, the nobleman\u2019s head flew off.The blood spurted out like a fountain, and with a clattering sound, the body collapsed from the neck up.\u201cMy client is dead, so the request is no more, and I can\u2019t take this money.\u201dWith that said, Raven disappeared from the scene as if he had never been there in the first place.The house later became a commotion, but it seemed that he was a nobleman doing all sorts of outrageous things behind the scenes, and many lives got saved because of his death.\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter killing the nobleman, the way he moved from building to building while jumping from one to another was nothing short of magnificent, and the way he blended in with the darkness of the night was the very image of an assassin.Raven headed to the clock tower, where he could see the whole city.\u201cDared to kill Haishin-sama. Pfft, there sure is some puny trash out there.\u201dRaven, the legendary assassin, also began to look familiar.As he put his hand on the mask and removed it, what appeared from inside was the face of a lovely, well-dressed girl.It was Raven\u2019s true identity.She is feared as a legendary assassin and has killed people by fulfilling many requests, but no one would ever guess that Raven\u2019s true identity is a girl.\u201cOh, it\u2019s starting\u2026\u201dThe removal of the mask made her sound like a girl her age.She pulled out her terminal and accessed a specific channel\u2026 Yes, it was Haishin\u2019s livestream.[Hey, guys, we\u2019re getting started with another day!]\u201cKyaaaahhh!? Haishin-samaaaaaa!?\u201dYes, she was a crazy believer, too, you know.Here, too, the demonic hand of Haishin was at work.The legendary assassin is also crazy for Haishin and is a bit of a simp, in her own way, as she\u2019s captivated by him.\u201cOhh, your lovely voice\u2026 is always soothing to hear.\u201dShe rubbed her cheek against the terminal and listened to his voice closely.For her, his streams are more important than her main job, assassination, and her priorities were completely dominated by Haishin\u2019s stream.[Today, I thought I would do my best to make one friend. But when I talked to him, the first thing he told me was to \u201cShut up\u201d\u2026 Please comfort me, guys.]Haishin may never really be on the verge of crying, but acting with a shaky voice is like an art form in his show.However, sometimes, there are troublesome beings who don\u2019t get it.\u201c\u2026\u201dHearing Haishin\u2019s words, the colour of her eyes changed, and she put her hand on her weapon.Haishin wouldn\u2019t have thought that the legendary assassin was listening to his stream.And in fact, this was a new addition to his troublesome followings, a legendary assassin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: And someone was thinking of the one who had goneThere is a small village in the mountains, quite far from the royal capital of Sistol.The small village named Roggin is a thriving agricultural community, which depended on selling things to the capital. Many others make a living by selling vegetables and other products grown in Roggin village to the rest of the world.\u201cFinished. I hope he\u2019s doing well.\u201dThe one who muttered that was a stout woman.She was a very strong lady with a big body that could easily carry heavy things.

I\u2019ll make it soon, so wait for a while.\u201dThe woman called Meza paused to respond to her husband\u2019s voice.As she washed her dirty hands, she thought of her son, who was no longer in this village.\u201cMom, I\u2019m going to the academy. Since I\u2019ve got quite a bit of magic power, I\u2019m going to make it as big as possible.\u201dSo saying, her son set out for the royal capital in high spirits.As a mother, she was sad to see her son go, but she wanted him to achieve his potential if he was born with quite a large amount of magical power.Above all, there was no way she could deny that her son wanted to do so.\u201cKanata\u2026 How are you doing?\u201dYes, this well-built woman named Meza was Kanata\u2019s mother.Although she was in touch with him regularly, Kanata seemed to be the same as ever through his letters.Well, she had yet to know that he was Haishin, who was now a big influencer to the world\u2026 Or rather, this place was too rural for Haishin\u2019s name to reach.\u201cWhat exactly are you doing, Kanata?\u201dThough Kanata sends her a good amount of money every month, she doesn\u2019t know how he earns it.Still, she doesn\u2019t believe her son is doing anything illegal, so she doesn\u2019t spend the money sent to her and keeps it safe.She left it for Kanata to late use himself in case something happened.\u201cOh, is Meza going to lunch now?\u201d\u201cYes, Chief, I intend to.\u201dIt was the village chief who approached Meza.The village chief was at an age where he seemed like he could die at any moment, but he was healthy enough to walk around the village like this.\u201cYou\u2019d better make him (husband) a nice meal. I\u2019m also on my way for a lunchtime talk with a messenger from the capital.\u201d\u201cAh, is that so? How come they\u2019re here all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cYes. At first, I thought something was fishy, but it seems it was on behalf of Lady Saint.\u201d\u201cOh, my God!\u201dMeza revealed her surprise at the village chief\u2019s words.It was unusual for a messenger from the royal capital to come to this remote area, and what\u2019s more, they were coming on the saint\u2019s behalf.A letter arrived first, asking if they had any problems or if there was anything they needed, and then arrangements were made for a messenger to visit the village.\u201cI would like to see if a road could be built to connect us to the city.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to suggest it. I don\u2019t know what kind of response I\u2019ll get, but I\u2019ve heard that Lady Saint is very kind. Since it\u2019s her messenger, I guess there isn\u2019t much to worry about.\u201dMeza smiled and said, \u201cYes, that\u2019d be great.\u201dThe village chief met and talked with the messenger, but it seemed the saint had already given instructions regarding road maintenance. So, it was fine even if the village chief didn\u2019t make any suggestions.\u201cIf I may ask, have you seen this place before?\u201d\u201cNo, Saint-Sama never leaves the capital.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hum.\u201dSo it was unclear if someone told the saint or if the saint found out about them some other way.Well, at any rate, if she can do a little good for the village this way, he would be happy as a village chief.\u201cThank you for your charity, Your Holiness.\u201d\u201cLet me tell you one more thing\u2026 Well, Saint-Sama is attending the academy right now.\u201d\u201cHou?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve heard that she seems to be enjoying herself every day, so we\u2019re happy for her.\u201dAfterward, they made small talk while making arrangements for the future.It was a remote place with nothing but old-fashioned buildings, but even so, the messengers, who never uttered a word of complaint, were said to have been greatly welcomed by the other villagers.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u201cHey, Alphana.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dKanata was about to leave the school when Alphana stopped him and asked if he would like to have a short talk with her.Although Kanata was requested to hide behind the eyes of other aristocratic and commoner students, he had no particular reason to refuse, so he nodded in agreement.\u201cYou all right over there? With all that saint\u2019s business and stuff.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. I always give instructions at night or in the morning, and there are no matters that require my presence right now.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dKanata was relieved to hear that it would be all right.It is true that when she appears as a saint, she is at large meetings and conferences with other countries.Even now, it is hard to believe that this petite girl sitting next to him held such a high position, but Kanata got reminded that being a saint is a great job after all.\u201cMore importantly, Kanata-sama, what happened to the person behind you today?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Something about him not feeling well or something, so he took the day off.\u201dThe particular boy who was said to be noisy towards Kanata was absent from the academy today, which is unusual for him.The teacher said he was apparently sick, but Kanata didn\u2019t care, especially as he was not interested in it.\u201cAs expected of a saint to worry about your absent classmates.\u201d\u201cFufu, that\u2019s not it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being nice.\u201d\u201cHeh?\u201dThe image of a saint is one of charity, but she shook her head that this was not the case.\u201cI was chosen to be a saint simply because I had the aptitude for it. The real me is not such a beautiful existence. I usually get angry, say I don\u2019t like what I don\u2019t like, and sometimes I get frustrated when I don\u2019t want to do something troublesome.\u201d\u201cOhh\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026 will even try to eliminate any entity I find disturbing, no questions asked.\u201dThere was a tremendous amount of pressure in her voice.However, Kanata did not think that it was not particularly saintly.Because getting angry, disgusted, and bothered are all natural human feelings.It was a feeling of knowing again that saints do not accept everything, even though it is a matter of course.\u201cSpeaking of which, the thing you asked me before, what was it all about?\u201d\u201cAh, you mean about Kanata-sama\u2019s hometown?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThe day before yesterday, Alphana asked Kanata about his hometown.When he told her it was a small village far away, she looked interested and asked him what kind of place it was.\u201cThe road leading to the village is a real wreck. It would be a lot easier if it got fixed up a bit.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 Is there anything else?\u201dThe conversation they had was still fresh in his mind.He even felt bad that there was nothing of particular interest to talk about, even if the other party was a saint.\u201cI learned a lot about a place I\u2019d never heard of before. It also made me think about what I can do to help.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Well, if it helps you learn anything, it\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cYes \u266a.\u201dHe didn\u2019t understand what she meant, but the atmosphere was a little scary, so he didn\u2019t ask for more details.While they were talking, an even more unexpected person came along.\u201cI knew you were here, Alphana.\u201d\u201cOh, come, Maria.\u201dIt was Maria who came.As for Kanata, he was surprised by the suddenness of it, but next to him, Alphana spoke up and said it was okay.\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you from Alphana, and I\u2019ve always admired your magic skills.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dMaria then sat down next to him.Maria and Alphana. Surrounded by these two beautiful girls who one would never easily meet, Kanata put a lot of effort into his cheeks, trying desperately not to smirk.(\u2026 Maybe I\u2019m in the middle of a popular phase?)He thought about it but then chuckled and calmed himself down, thinking that he would soon find out it was not true.But for some reason, Maria kept staring at Kanata\u2019s face.Kanata looked to see what was wrong with that gaze, which seemed to be earnestly searching for something, but it was Alphana who drew her attention.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t stare at people\u2019s faces so much, Maria.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind\u2026\u201dHe returned it plainly and quickly changed it back to an honorific, but Maria laughed at him with a chuckle.\u201cYou speak normally with Alphana, don\u2019t you? Then you don\u2019t have to use honorifics with me either. We are equals in the academy. You can forget about my title of princess.\u201d\u201cAm I allowed to?\u201dHe changed the honorifics to tame-mouthed, completely the opposite of what he had just said.Maria didn\u2019t look uncomfortable and nodded that it was okay, so she was happy with this.(Let\u2019s put this feeling on the streaming today. Who would have known that chatting with such beautiful girls would be so nice!)Thanks to these girls, Kanata had a story to use for his streaming.Incidentally, Maria continued to stare at Kanata\u2019s face in a way he wouldn\u2019t notice.What does it mean and what will it bring\u2026 is something no one knows.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: This is going to be huge\u201cAll right, I\u2019d better be on my way.\u201d\u201cYeah. See you later.\u201d\u201cKanata-sama, let\u2019s talk more next time.\u201dAlphana let out a passionate exhale as she watched Kanata\u2019s back while he left.(Kanata-sama\u2026 Haishin-sama\u2026 Oh, how wonderful, how lucky I am to meet the man of my dreams like this \u266a.)Alphana muttered in her mind, knowing the fact that Kanata was Haishin.She was aware of it since the day they ran into each other on the street, and his hand was like what she saw on stream.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m curious. But I know it can\u2019t be true.\u201dMaria blurted out, and Alphana\u2019s smile deepened.Truthfully, Maria was unaware of Kanata\u2019s true identity and was bothered by his accent and speech, which she pointed out earlier.But even so, it may be inevitable that one couldn\u2019t come up with the idea that Haishin, who she admired, was so close.(Maria will soon find out, but until then, it\u2019s good that I\u2019m the only one who knows about Kanata-sama \u266a.)By the way, they both know they both were Haishin\u2019s followers.However, they did not tell each other they were simps, nor did they know that when alone, their personalities changed so much merely by listening to Haishin\u2019s voice.All they knew about the other was that the other was a fellow follower.\u201cThat\u2019s really unusual. For Alphana to be friendly with a man.\u201d\u201cIs that so? I think it\u2019s normal for classmates.\u201d\u201cAra, but I heard you being salty about other men?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t like it when people talk to me when they don\u2019t have any particular use.\u201dIt\u2019s not hard to see why people try to please her because she is a saint.If Alphana comes to favour someone, they may receive an important role or even be considered special.There were definitely people getting told by their families to find a way for Alphana to remember their names.\u201cAs I told you before Maria, Kanata-sama helped me in an accident. There are other reasons, of course, but what better reason could there be to be friends with him?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Well, yeah. But be careful, okay? He\u2019s a commoner, and you\u2019re a saint. Though I don\u2019t care about status, there\u2019s still a strong sense of discrimination among others.\u201dAlphana knew all about that.That is why she was conscious of meeting with him in secret so as not to cause Kanata any trouble.Although it was not necessary to do so, he was so careful that he never forgot to check for the presence of anyone approaching him in the academy.\u201cAs Haishin-sama said, discrimination is really a barren thing. Why can\u2019t they understand that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true! If only they had listened to Haishin-sama, discrimination would be\u2026 Ahem, Alphana is right. It\u2019s really barren.\u201dOops, she gave Alphana a deceptive look, which made her look at Maria suspiciously.She thought that maybe Maria was also devoting everything to Haishin, just like her, but Alphana nodded her head, thinking that it was still good for now.\u201cKanata-sama has left, so I\u2019ll be going now.\u201d\u201cI guess so. I think I\u2019ll go back to the dormitory and relax today.\u201dAnd so Alphana parted ways with Maria.As long as she attended the academy, Alphana had to stay in the dormitory, but just like Maria, she got a special private room.It would be scary to imagine what this saint would do if she were to find out that Kanata also has a private room for himself.\u201cI\u2019m back\u2026 Oh, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m the only one here.\u201dJust out of habit, she greeted just like she did when she returned to the church.Chuckling as she remembered that she was alone, she put down her luggage, sat down on her bed, and reflected on the day.\u201cKanata-sama\u2026 Haishin-sama\u2026 Ahh, it\u2019s hard to discard either way of calling you. But since you have given me permission to call you by your true name, I\u2019ll call you Kanata-sama.\u201dKanata, just calling that name, filled Alphana\u2019s heart with passion.(What is he doing now~? Is he preparing for the stream at night?)It was all Alphana thought about without blinking.Her body was facing the wall, but her gaze pointed straight toward Kanata\u2019s room in the men\u2019s dormitory.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s a mystery whether she was aware of it or was doing it because she knows where Kanata\u2019s room is.\u201cKanata-sama, I have something to repent to you for.\u201dShe laid her hands on each other in front of her chest.She looked like a saint praying, looking very holy even though she was in her room, dimly lit, without anyone watching.\u201cWhen you allowed me to call you by your name, I had sinful thoughts of marrying you, even if only for a time.\u201dAlphana continued to speak.To confess her sins.\u201cIt is foolish for a mere saint like me to think of such a thing with Kanata-sama. You are the Supreme Being, the God, whom it is impossible for a little girl like me to stand next to.\u201dKanata never thought of himself as such an exalted being, but Alphana\u2019s warped values didn\u2019t help.\u201cBut\u2026 But if you want me to, let me give this body and soul to you. Ahh, Kanata-sama\u2026 Kanata-samaaaa!\u201dIt seemed she couldn\u2019t control it anymore, so she moaned in agony.She may be crazy, but she was thinking about the necessities and showing her natural cleverness without regret.Kanata was giving his invaluable time to Alphana as Haishin.If so, she would like to give something in return, so she decided to get to know Kanata\u2019s surroundings first.\u201cWhere is your hometown, Kanata-sama?\u201d\u201cWhere am I from? Roggin, from the countryside.\u201dFrom there, she learned of his hometown, and knowing that the roads were in bad condition, she immediately sent out some instructions.Power abuse? A monopoly? She didn\u2019t care about it because, for Alphana, service to God\u2019s equal is natural.\u201cKanata-sama, I would like to eventually talk with you while you are Haishin-sama, but\u2026 You won\u2019t reveal your name and face. Then I will treat Kanata-sama as just a classmate until the time comes for something to change.\u201dHaishin\u2019s name was already widely known in this world.She knew there were many forces recognizing him as a powerful existence and wanted to have him as a national figure, but she also knew many sinister forces wanted to get rid of him.To deny him is an insult to God, and anyone who insults Kanata or speaks out against him, no matter how small, must get eradicated.\u201cKanata-sama, I will watch over and support you from the shadows. That is my role and the meaning of life. All my power as a saint is for you.\u201dShe had long since surpassed the level of being a crazy simp.Alphana wanted to become useful for Kanata in any way possible, and she really believed that\u2019s what she was supposed to do as a believer fascinated by him.\u201c\u2026 In that case, it might be good to recruit people who worship Haishin-sama.\u201dAlphana thought it would be a good idea to create a community of those who were fascinated by Kanata as a Haishin and had been following him for a long time.A kind of fan club that gathers those who are willing to risk everything for him.\u201cIt\u2019d be wonderful. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what kind of people will be there.\u201dThus, a community was about to be formed without Kanata\u2019s knowledge.When it grew enough, she intended to tell Kanata about it on his stream. If he recognized it as a good thing, it would become an officially recognized fan club.Well. Aside from Kanata, Alphana, the originator of the idea, would never have thought of the following\u2026Not only did people from different statuses, such as nobility and commoners, but also bigwigs of various countries, the King of the entire Demon race, a legendary assassin, high-ranking adventurers, and former slaves would become a part of it\u2026 Naturally, there is no way someone would predict that such a gathering would be possible in future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: When you\u2019re famous, impersonators are bound to existIt was during the streaming.As usual, Kanata was talking to his listeners as Haishin, but this comment caught his attention.: By the way, how do you feel about your growing influence, Haishin-sama?Influence. It was something people asked about, but it didn\u2019t really ring a bell.Kanata didn\u2019t appear in front of the public and just talked about whatever he wanted through the terminal.With that said, he knew he had become quite famous and understood that his words could make a difference\u2026 but he was still not going to change this stance.[I don\u2019t really care, but I know I\u2019ve become influential in no small manner. It\u2019s a sign that I\u2019m watched by lots of people as a streamer.]He doesn\u2019t intend to change his stance, but that didn\u2019t mean he would say anything radical.It is paramount to be objective about things, just like that time someone asked him for help. He advised them to settle the situation in the best way possible, along with his opinion.When he gives advice, he just states what he wants and thinks should be done.[Well, I\u2019m just going to keep saying what I want. Now I can get my words out to everyone and show something to them, even if it\u2019s only my hands for now. There are many other things I want to do, you know?]He wants to do all the things he had seen streamers do in his previous life.Right now, it is still limited to projecting his hand, but he\u2019d like to have the opportunity to project other images, make it portable, and do things like vlogging.: Haishin-sama, I hope you will keep growing as I will offer you my assistance!: I\u2019m looking forward to it, Haishin. Being able to hear your voice is the ultimate happiness.: If there\u2019s anything you want me to do for you, say it, and I\u2019ll help you out.Kanata received many positive comments.Sometimes he receives horrible mails and a tremendous amount of money, but Kanata is able to continue streaming because of all of the listeners.[I can\u2019t thank you enough, everyone \u266a.]It was an unusually flippant thank you.The comments stopped for a moment when he said it, somewhat embarrassed, as he couldn\u2019t hide his joy.But soon, the comments moved in at an alarming rate.[By the way\u2026]It was then that something occurred to Kanata.Kanata was aware of his influence to some extent but not about the entirety of it.So he asked this question.[What if I were to say something stupid like I want to take over the world?]: I will cooperate to the end.: I will use all my power to offer you the world.: It\u2019s simple. I will overrun the city and hand it over to Haishin.: I\u2019m used to killing people. If you rely on me, I\u2019ll kill anyone for you.: Let all things come to naught, and a new order shall get established for you.Many comments appeared about various things, and Kanata reflected on the fact that he had said some strange things.[Don\u2019t take me too seriously! I\u2019m not interested in world domination, and I\u2019m not trying to take over anyone. Well, I don\u2019t want anyone else to get oppressed, so let\u2019s all not hurt anyone else!]Kanata quickly said so and ended the subject. One\u2019s words can be a curse, and who knows who might be listening. *Note: Be careful because careless remarks and words often bring disaster.*Thinking back, he remembers watching a lot of streamers in his previous life who said even something small could become a huge problem and cause a huge wildfire.(I should be careful too. Well, there\u2019s no such thing as wildfires in this world, but I\u2019d better watch out\u2026)[EDN: Wildfires -> hot topics?]After making up his mind, he was even more determined to avoid false rumours speeding into the public eye.[Well, we\u2019ve got a lot of reading today.]It was time to read mail as usual.Kanata likes to read heartwarming mails from time to time, and the first one he saw was exactly like he expected.[Haishin-sama. I\u2019m not troubled or anything, but I want to offer my gratitude for one thing.My family had been in the slave business for generations, but my parents and servants, including myself, thought of slaves as nothing more than tools.However, a change occurred in our family after we heard your concern about slaves. Slaves are lives born in this world just like us, and although it was obvious, we were unaware of it.When I thought they were just like us, equal to us, I realized how terrible we were.I am truly grateful to you for making me aware of that.I\u2019m going to atone for what I\u2019ve done, no matter how long it takes.][\u2026 I feel different when you say it\u2019s thanks to me, but I\u2019m glad to hear it. Please continue to take good care of your slaves. I bet your slaves are glad to have you as their master.]He didn\u2019t know how the slaves felt, but at least they were better than being oppressed.The perception of slaves had changed in the kingdom since Kanata sent out his voice sometime ago that slaves are also life.Kanata is not going to be arrogant about this being his power.[It was heartwarming from the very first mail. Okay, next one\u2026][I\u2019d like to have some of Haishin-sama\u2019s belongings.][\u2026 Oi, come on, that\u2019s straight to the point.]No way someone actually wanted Kanata\u2019s personal belongings, right?Since he didn\u2019t even know who the recipient was, sending it to their address was just a dream. Kanata, however, thought he would like to maybe do a giveaway for his listeners at some point.[I\u2019d like to do a giveaway at some point. I\u2019m not sure what to offer\u2026 Hmm, maybe I\u2019d make some sort of Haishin merchandise.]He wondered if some merchandise would be a standard item, and although he had yet to conceive the idea enough to give it shape, he naturally desired to try making it.[I have a rough idea, but I\u2019m not quirky enough to give it a go, I\u2019ll have to think about it with someone else.]: Then, by all means, I will listen to you! Since I believe I\u2019m in the best position to help Haishin-sama![Princess\u2026 You really are a nobody.]He knew she was rich because she always gave him a lot of money, but well. It\u2019s still scary because he can\u2019t see her face.He decided to slowly think about how to do this while keeping merchandise sales in mind and read the next mail.[Love you, Haishin-sama.][I love all of you too.]Realizing what he just said, Kanata felt chills to the point, thinking that some listeners might\u2019ve gone crazy.It wasn\u2019t wrong for him to feel so, as he could hear some strange voices coming from far away through the window of his room.Kanata then continued to spend time with his listeners as he read their mails.But the next day, an incident occurred.\u201cI wonder why\u2026 I\u2019m so sleepy in the mornings.\u201dKanata muttered as he plopped down on the desk as usual.As more and more people started arriving in the classroom, it got noisier. Kanata turned his attention to Alphana, whom he had become friends with.She got surrounded by many students, and the way she handled them with a smile was quintessentially saintly.\u201cI\u2019ll never be able to make it\u2026\u201dWell, it\u2019s useless to think about it because he didn\u2019t have anyone to talk to over there, nor did they like him back.Then, he took his gaze away from Alphana and closed his eyes again.\u201cHey, did you hear that?\u201d\u201cYeah, I just heard.\u201d\u201cIs he for real?\u201dThe girls who always provided gossip next to him were talking about something today.Kanata listened to the girls while pretending to be asleep to pass the time\u2026 and an unexpected topic came up in their conversation.\u201cI\u2019m talking about a noble named Aguila Trace who belongs to the SS class. I heard he\u2019s none other than Haishin himself.\u201d\u201cSomehow, I heard someone talking about it this morning too.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Isn\u2019t that a lie? I just can\u2019t believe it to be true.\u201dFakes come out when you\u2019re famous, and that\u2019s apparently what happened.\u201c\u2026 No, it\u2019s easy to tell he\u2019s lying, stupid..\u201dIt was obvious that Haishin was Kanata and not a nobleman named Aguila.If Kanata were to say so in his stream, that would be it\u2026 but if he tells this story there, it will create speculation that Kanata is in the royal capital and furthermore, people might find out he is an academy student.\u201c\u2026 Are? That\u2019d be easy to deny, right? No, it\u2019d be okay if I tell them I got a snitch from somewhere.\u201dAs soon as he found the solution, he decided to leave it aside for now.However, Kanata thought too little of the influence the name Haishin had. Even if someone lied and became a fake, for better words, Haishin still attracted lots.In other words, whether out of curiosity or else, something was bound to happen to the noble student who told a lie.\u201cSaint-sama? Is something wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. Ufufu.\u201dTLN- Welp since author uses names based on some kind of animals, I guess this one should be \u201cAguila\u201d (Eagle) instead of Agira.Also forgot to mention before, the assassins\u2019 name is \u201cKarasu\u201d(JP) in raws but I decided to go with \u201cRaven\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: The Demon King is madKanata has no idea about the noble student, Aguila, who was impersonating Haishin.Rather, his interest was never there in the first place.It is because most noble students look down on the commoners and don\u2019t want anything to do with them.(Still, this has caused a fair amount of commotion.)Not only from his class but there were apparently students from other classes heading over to catch a glimpse of Aguila.Most of them didn\u2019t believe it, and Aguila seemed to have already gotten screwed as the words spread around that whatever he was saying was bullshit.\u201cThat\u2019s given. As someone who has followed Haishin for so long, I can say that person is the least likely to be him.\u201d\u201cYeah, and Haishin calls himself a commoner.\u201dKanata was still listening to the girls\u2019 conversation.Kanata remembers mentioning in his streams that he was a commoner, and just from that point, people knew the boy was impersonating him.And while the student Aguila himself is normal, there are many dark rumours about his house. Because of that, the number of students who believe in him is nonexistent.\u201cMaybe I should go take a look around.\u201dHe was slightly interested.Kanata got up and went straight down the hallway to Aguila\u2019s class, and he didn\u2019t need to go inside as he heard the commotion from outside.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m Haishin! Why can\u2019t any of you understand that!?\u201d\u201cPfft!\u201dKanata gushed at so many excuses.Curious, Kanata peeked inside to see what kind of dunce face he had.\u201c\u2026 Ain\u2019t he so handsome?\u201dTo his surprise, Aguila was a handsome man.As an aristocrat, he looked like he got raised in a good family. Unfortunately, Kanata had a bias against the face of those who seemed to have power over others.\u201cI don\u2019t know, but if you\u2019re somewhat famous and your face isn\u2019t well known, there will be impersonations, of course. I\u2019ve seen this kind of thing in my past life.\u201dThere have been many cases of people pretending to be someone and leading others to strange websites or scamming them by saying they would give away money.In comparison to that, the thing that Aguila did was impersonate Haishin\u2026 Kanata said it was a silly thing to do.\u201cBut I don\u2019t want my name to get used without my permission\u2026 what do I do now?\u201dBut Kanata was curious as to why he had to go so far as to use Haishin\u2019s name, so he decided to follow him for the day.That said, he wanted to use his free time to follow Aguila and wait for him to express his true self, but to his surprise, the time came rather quickly.\u201cDamn, Haishin this, Haishin that, they\u2019re all so noisy. Damn fanatics.\u201dAfter school, when classes were over, Kanata followed Aguila.The place that Aguila visited was behind a deserted building, and in such a place, Aguila was kicking and hitting the wall without trying to hide his irritation.\u201cYou\u2019re done taking what a commoner says seriously. The world revolves around us, the chosen nobility! Just because he is doing something rare doesn\u2019t mean you should listen to that trash with no face to recognize!\u201dKanata heard some of his whining from a distance. Apparently, he was thinking of becoming Hiashin and ruining his reputation down to earth.His family seemed to fully agree with him.Kanata was too dumbfounded to say anything about such a poor plan.\u201cIt\u2019s not a kid\u2019s play, you know\u2026 That\u2019s not going to work.\u201dEven if Haishin\u2019s reputation fell to the ground, he wondered if Aguila realized what would happen to him who was impersonating Haishin.If they were smarter, they could have done many things in Haishin\u2019s name instead of using it this way\u2026 Apparently, the Aguila family was quite stupid.\u201cTrue. Such a stupid thing to do.\u201d\u201cYeah. Even idiots can\u2019t get saved if they come this far.\u201d\u201c?\u201dKanata then looked back in surprise.He wondered when they had been there. Maria and Alphana were standing right behind him.\u201c\u2026 When?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. We also need him.\u201d\u201cYes. It is an important matter. However, it appears that Kanata-sama also has something to do with him.\u201dAt that moment, the atmosphere surrounding Alphana changed, but it quickly returned to normal with a huff, and both Kanata and Maria tilted their heads, wondering what that was.Now, two noble figures who represent the academy appeared by Kanata\u2019s side.Kanata was in a panic as to what to do.\u201c\u2026 Erm.\u201dHe wanted to ask for help on what to do in this situation, but there was no one else to ask.While Kanata\u2019s eyes were wandering, Alphana opened her mouth, smiling softly.\u201cKanata-sama, are you familiar with Haishin-sama?\u201dKanata\u2019s heart jumped at that name.But somehow, he nodded, not letting his expression show.\u201cTo tell you the truth, Maria and I are big fans of Haishin-sama.\u201d\u201cAlphana!\u201d\u201c\u2026 heh heh.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t particularly happy to hear such a revelation on this occasion.He was more puzzled because he had no idea that the princess and the saint were listening to his streams, much less that they were fans.\u201cMaria and I both are in important positions in our country, and we had our fair share of hardships that made us uncomfortable a few times. But then we found out about Haishin-sama and couldn\u2019t help but found ourselves captivated by him\u2026\u201d\u201cOhh\u2026\u201d\u201cAlphana, you don\u2019t have to say that much!\u201dAlphana continued speaking, paying no attention to Maria\u2019s flustered state.\u201cThat is why we cannot allow him to tarnish Haishin-sama this way. Many of us know he had been telling lies all morning, and we were curious, just like Kanata-sama, why he did it!\u201d\u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t know that.\u201dWell, as for the reason why it seems that Aguila just now confessed everything.He continued to verbally denigrate Haishin, unaware that Kanata and the others were listening behind the bushes.The longer this happened, the further the mood of the two people by Kanata\u2019s side plummeted, although Kanata had changed from bewildered to slightly impressed.(\u2026 I\u2019m so happy that the Princess and the Saint are my fans. I\u2019ve been a little bit critical of the country\u2019s state, but judging by their reactions\u2026 I think it\u2019s going to be alright?)Alphana didn\u2019t seem to have any problems.Maria also opened her mouth with one big sigh, perhaps because Alphana had told him everything.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really care that much, okay? But I still can\u2019t tolerate him trying to bring down someone I care about a little bit.\u201d\u201cSo it was that.\u201d\u2018That\u2019s kind~\u2019, Kanata honestly thought in his heart.At that time, Alphana suddenly looked at Kanata and said this.\u201cI see no reason to forgive him, but now that you\u2019re here, Kanata-sama, what do you think we should do?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAlphana asked, looking Kanata straight in his eye.Maria, like Alphana, also stared at Kanata as if she wanted to hear his opinion.\u201c\u2026 Well, impersonating someone\u2019s name is a nuisance, so I think it\u2019s better for him to stop. But the question is, will it be fine if he just reflects on it? Maybe, but I don\u2019t think Haishin would want anything too radical either.\u201dFor Kanata, this was the maximum concession he could make.He didn\u2019t suffer any real harm from being impersonated. Everything Aguila did was in vain, and no one believed him\u2026 At that point, he didn\u2019t even think about making any sort of judgment.\u201cI understood. Now then\u2026!\u201d\u201cWha!?\u201dThe moment Alphana nodded, Kanata saw something incredible.Aguila, who was just in their line of sight, got wrapped in a black sphere and disappeared.Maria and Alphana also immediately turned their gazes towards him, but Aguila was already nowhere to be seen as if he disappeared in thin air.\u201cWhere did he go?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 But Alphana was that\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. I felt the power of a demonic being.\u201dA demonic being. That meant demons were behind his abduction.\u201cHey, what the f**k are you\u2026\u201dMeanwhile, Aguila, who had suddenly disappeared, was not in the human world.The place he got sent to was the demon world, and he was right in front of a beautiful woman who reigned at the top of the demon people.\u201cAre you Haishin, human?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe woman\u2019s words almost made Aguila say yes, but he couldn\u2019t say anything.Her blood-red eyes were so sharp he felt he could see his future reflecting on them.\u201cMy Lady, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s quite right. Although this guy\u2019s magic power is SS\u2026 equivalent by human standards, it\u2019s impossible for his voice to broadcast in all directions.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dThe woman then stood up.She was only a little taller than Aguila, about 180 cm. (5\u201911)Even though it was just a tall woman walking, Aguila felt as if the ground was shaking.\u201cAre you prepared to pay for the crime of impersonating someone I love?\u201d\u201cHiii?\u201dAguila fell on his butt in place as the woman\u2019s magic expanded.With a gurgling sound, his pants got wet, and the yellow liquid spread filthily.Aguila would never dream that the Demon King was a follower of Haishin.Well, he was pretty confused, so he didn\u2019t seem to have time to worry about the Demon King being a woman or that the demon tribe knew about Haishin\u2026[Postscript]Aguila-kun, you will live\u2026\u2026 In our memories.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: What happened to you!?\u201c\u2026 That being said, isn\u2019t that super bad?\u201dKanata was momentarily stunned by Aguila\u2019s unexpected disappearance before him, but his muttering caused Maria and Alphana to move in panic.\u201cIndividually, there seems to be nothing wrong with it, but\u2026 and for a saint, it\u2019s definitely not good!\u201d\u201cI too wanted to say that\u2026 No-no, but for a princess, that\u2019s a matter of concern.\u201dBy the way, Kanata didn\u2019t hear them muttering.Whatever that pitch-black sphere was, Kanata had never seen it before, but Alphana had said earlier that it was a sign of evil.He knew that meant it was the work of the demon tribe.But he had no idea why the demons were interested in Aguila.\u201cCould it be the demons too?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is it possible? Well, it might be possible if it\u2019s about the prestige of Haishin-sama!\u201d\u201cWhat have you been mumbling about all this time?\u201dThe moment Kanata asked this, the black sphere from earlier appeared again.\u201c?\u201d\u201cKya!\u201d\u201cAh \u266a.\u201dPulling Maria and Alphana, both of whom had their backs turned, behind him to protect, Kanata positioned himself to intercept it at any time.Even though he had an unlimited magical power, he did not have much fighting knowledge. Still, as a man, he naturally moved his body to protect them.\u201c\u2026?\u201dHowever, despite his caution, it was Aguila who showed up.He was foaming at the mouth, partly because he had passed out, and a disgusting smell wafted through the air as he showed up.The smell was Aguila\u2019s urine, and not only Kanata but even Maria and Alphana had their hands over their noses.\u201cHaha, what an embarrassment of a human.\u201dRight after him, another figure appeared. It was an inhuman being with giant wings.He had a goofy voice, and with his tone and looks\u2026 he seemed to be a coquettish person.Aside from his large wings, he had a large body, golden hair, and slightly visible sharp teeth that looked like blades.\u201cDemons!\u201d\u201cBack off, Kanata-kun!\u201dKanata was still on his guard, but Maria, with her sword drawn, and Alphana, who had begun casting magic, stood in front of him.The demon looked at Kanata and the others, but he showed no hostile intent at all.\u201cOops, sorry for showing up out of the blue. My master is very upset with this guy who pretended to be Haishin. So we had to take him away for a slight punishment.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d\u201cHaishin-sama?\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dWell, suddenly, the chaotic atmosphere began to spread\u2026Kanata was shocked to hear the name Haishin from the mouth of a demon while Maria and Alphana rolled their eyes, letting their guard down, if only for a moment.\u201cIf you say Haishin-sama\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yeah.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d\u201cOh, hey\u2026\u201dKanata was puzzled by the three, who seemed to be somehow communicating with each other.Maria retracted her sword, and Alphana also dispelled the magic she had been casting.\u201c\u2026 Kukuh! So that\u2019s how it is. I guess we\u2019re on the same side!\u201dThe demon, with a friendly smile on his face, approached them unguardedly.Although the demon world has just offered a non-intervention treaty to the human world, it is natural for them to be somewhat wary.\u201c\u2026.? Oh, well, I guess you guys are still wary of me. Humans and demons have a long way to go before we fully understand each other. No matter how many words Haishin has to say.\u201d\u201cYou are\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Fumu.\u201dThe three of them had solemn looks on their faces, but Kanata was the only one who looked tired and wondered what was going on between them.Were they already thinking of Aguila as something that didn\u2019t exist? It\u2019s too sad, but it\u2019s better if he was still alive.Well, you might want to die as a man when the princess and the saint, both considered the country\u2019s supreme treasures, see you like that.\u201dWell, I merely wanted to punish this guy this time. There are many followers of Haishin among the demon tribe, including me. I\u2019m not so inclined, but my master, the Demon Lord\u2026 is a bit obsessed with him. She always listens to him without fail.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Seriously?\u201d\u201cSurprised, right? Well, that\u2019s how interesting Haishin is!\u201dThe demon then smiled again and said so.It was the first time Kanata saw a demon say many good things about his work. He felt better and was happy.Well, it\u2019s no surprise that he couldn\u2019t say he is Haishin, but it was still a delightful surprise that the demon people were his followers.\u201cThat\u2019s how wonderful Haishin-sama is\u2026\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 a being that connects across the boundaries between humans and demons\u2026 ahh, Haishin-sama \u266a.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 you have the same as the Demon King.\u201dSo the demon turned to Kanata.He looked at Kanata and muttered in admiration.\u201cYou\u2019ve got more convincing magical powers than the guy lying around there that was faking Haishin, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI wonder why.\u201dHe pretended not to be shaken, but his heart was racing.Even Maria began to stare at him with a questioning look after hearing the demon\u2019s words, but he was afraid to look in that direction, unfortunately.Alphana clapped her hands to save Kanata, who was thinking about how to settle the situation.\u201cDemon one, if you have no intention to be hostile, then let\u2019s end the matter here. As for him, we had something to say about him. We would give him the worst punishment possible.\u201d\u201cYeah. Though this guy had already received the worst punishment possible as the Demon Lord themselves subdued him with her magical power.\u201d\u201cThen I guess that should be enough since he had committed such a great sin.\u201d\u201cFu~n? You\u2019ve got a pretty good personality, don\u2019t you, young lady?\u201d\u201cUfufu \u266a.\u201d\u201cHaha \u266a.\u201dKanata already wanted to tell the three, who were getting along for some reason, that he wanted to go home.Soon after that, the demon left, but as for Kanata, it was like he had spent a very intense time.\u201cMaria, stop staring at him like that.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cSpeaking of which, Maria, didn\u2019t you say you had something to do today?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah! How could\u2019ve I missed that!?\u201dApparently, Maria had something to do so she ran off immediately.The way she stared at him, like staring at the absolute dark, was frightening, but he felt like he had somehow been saved.\u201c\u2026 What a day today.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t agree more.\u201dAlphana, with her petite body, looked up at Kanata as she approached.\u201cKanata-sama.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dLooking down at her, he found her very cute, partly because of her petite body. It was enough to make Kanata\u2019s heart pound.\u201cThank you for protecting me. It made me so happy \u266a.\u201d\u201cOhh, you mean about that?\u201dWell, it\u2019s a man\u2019s job to protect the ladies, or so he wanted to say, but Kanata scratched his cheek and looked away.It is at times like this that his lack of familiarity with women becomes apparent.However, even though he averted his gaze, Alphana never laughed and continued to look at Kanata with respect.\u201c\u2026 So cool.\u201dBy the way, he heard this muttering.Kanata\u2019s face turned even redder, but he could not leave Aguila alone, so he approached him to carry him to the dormitory.\u201cWell, that was a disaster.\u201d\u201cYou are very kind, Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s pretty normal, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHe picked Aguila up and was about to put his arm around his shoulder when he woke up.\u201cW-where am I\u2026?\u201dThen he looked at Kanata and crouched down in fear.\u201cHa, Haishin-sama help me\u2026 Haishin-sama help me, I beg of you!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAra\u2026\u201dKanata and Alphana looked at each other at the sight of Aguila, who should have hated Haishin, but for some reason, asked Haishin for help.(\u201cAbout how he hated Haishin, and when he came back, he asked for his help.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a story in the making.\u201d)Kanata was very curious as to what kind of punishment he had received.However, in a sense, this event was certainly bountiful for Kanata as he learned something about the demon tribe.(\u2026 If what that demon said is true, then the demon king listens to me too? Oh, was that why humanity received an offer for a non-intervention treaty?)It was rumoured that the non-interference that the demon tribe side had suggested might be due to the influence of Haishin, but it may not be so.Incidentally, as an aside, Aguila fully admitted that he lied.In a very short span, he transformed into a completely different man as he accused his family of all the wrongdoings, or so the rumour goes.\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous to try to demean Haishin-sama, and I won\u2019t tolerate such an act.\u201d\u2018That was what Aguila had become accustomed to saying,\u2019 his friends said in horror.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: Fourth Believer, Courtesan Kanna\u201cGood job, Kanna. Our customers were very pleased today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s part of my job.\u201dA woman replied shortly to a man in one of the first classrooms.Her name is Kanna, and she is a very beautiful lady renowned as a Courtesan.\u201cIt\u2019s time, Owner. I need to be alone for a while.\u201d\u201cI know. Good grief, if I didn\u2019t have work to do, I would have loved to hear Haishin-sama\u2019s voice.\u201d\u201cPfft, there\u2019s no way around it.\u201dAt Kanna\u2019s words, the man, the owner, left the room.Making sure he left, Kanna took off her work dress and hung it on the wall.Her beauty was like a heavenly maiden in her pristine, flawless appearance.She had long, shiny, bright red hair and blue eyes and an intimidating sharp gaze, but more than that, the bewitching atmosphere she exuded was remarkable.Her fresh white skin has never faded, no matter how many men have embraced her, and her uneven bountiful body was still growing in color with each passing of twenty.\u201cAnother satisfying day of work\u2026 All thanks to Haishin-sama.\u201dNaked, she lay on the bed with a portable terminal in her hand.She had been waiting to hear his voice from that terminal\u2026 and the time had finally come.[Hey, guys! Are you all here today?]\u201cAll ready, Haishin-samaahhhhhhhh!\u00a0Don-don pafu-pafu!\u201d[1]\u2026 Yes, she was one of his avid believers too.Her bewitching beauty was still the same, but her expression was that of a young girl as she revealed her joy at hearing Haishin\u2019s voice.She rubbed the terminal against her cheek and acted creepily as if she wanted to hear the voice more closely in real-time.[Something unusual happened to me today. Though I can\u2019t go into much detail, I still wanted to let you all know that a lot happened. A lot.]\u201cI wonder what you\u2019ve been through. Ah! \u2026 If only you were here, I would\u2019ve healed you with everything I have.\u201dAs mentioned earlier, Kanna was a Courtesan, so there was no way a commoner could be able to hold her.Only those with enough money in nobility could ask for her, and amongst them were many rich people in love with her beauty, who always came begging for her hand.\u201c\u2026 Haishin-sama.\u201dKanna whispered Haishin\u2019s name as she let out a sweet exhale.Originally, Kanna was a woman who grew up in the slums and was not associated with her position as a Courtesan.One way or another, she became a pr*stitute at an early age when she got led by the previous owner, who visited her in the slums.\u201cEven a cesspool of a woman like you will shine if you polish her up. Look, I took you women who had no one to look after, so from now on, you have to work for me.\u201dThat\u2019s what the previous owner used to say.It was hard for her to get used to selling her body to a stranger, but she had no choice but to obey because she had to earn money to survive.Whatever the method, it was far better than dying hungry, as long as you put up with the treatment.\u201c\u2026 We are young now, but we will all get ruined as we get older. And when that happens, we\u2019ll go back to that place again.\u201dThat\u2019s what all courtesans fear.The social status of courtesans was quite low. Even local women often looked at them as if they were filth.They survived, but they still remained at the bottom of the pile. Such a world was the promised world of nightly service, burdened with the sorrow of being discarded when their youth expired.\u201c\u2026 But then Haishin-sama saved us.\u201dKanna\u2026 No, there was an unforgettable day for all the women in this brothel.It was when Haishin had become somewhat famous that the women who worked in the brothel, including Kanna, listened to his podcast as a form of entertainment.[Let\u2019s see, huh\u2026 Do you agree that all the women in the brothel are like trash, Haishin-san?]It was a word that tore at the heart too much.Kanna was unsure, but several colleagues around her said it was terrible and shed tears.In the end, they felt that no matter how hard they tried, they always got labeled as filth. They could never hope for more and would never have a future where they could be happy and proud.But he\u2026 Haishin was different.[What is this nonsense? What kind of position are you in to say something so stupid, scum?]Those were words filled with Haishin\u2019s anger.Kanna, the new owner, and her co-workers listened to the rest of what he had to say with blank stares.[Well, I don\u2019t know many things, but I don\u2019t understand why people talk about pr*stitutes like that. Some people might not understand how it feels to sell your body to the opposite s*x, but I think they\u2019re great people, you know?]I think they\u2019re great, and those words made many ladies look up.[You see, pr*stitution is an industry\u2026 ah, and what\u2019s that? It\u2019s a job that sells dreams to men, right? There are many people who want to be with a woman, even if it\u2019s only for a short time, and of course, to be healed from their daily fatigue. Hey, questioner, can you still say trash to the women who heal you like that?]The anger that Haishin held seemed to have lessened, but his words went on.Each of these words shone a light into the hearts of Kanna and the other courtesans, leading them to have a change in their perception and improve their social status.[I think some people like to be pr*stitutes. But I am sure that most of them are in need of money, are young people abandoned by their families, or are slaves. You can\u2019t be a night lady forever, and as you get older, you\u2019re less and less likely to be desired.]They all nodded at that.Because all beauty can\u2019t win over the flow of time and decay\u2026 Haishin then spoke up with this kind of proposal.[Selling your body is simple, but it\u2019s not easy. They had to go through a lot of burdens and sacrifices. So I think we should pay such people a fair price and give them enough money to live well when they eventually quit being pr*stitutes.]The sort of man he was\u2026 No, there is no one else like him.Haishin was just saying what he thought, and he always does, so it was just another of his thoughts and opinions.However, Kanna and the others were happy to actually hear him express his care for them.[Let\u2019s get them to save up some money. Let\u2019s make it a place where they can leave thinking, \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019ve worked so hard, and I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve endured until now.\u201d]His words were so kind that many women were in tears.And whether these words of Haishin\u2019s were the catalyst or not, brothels underwent drastic reforms.It was not immediate, but people\u2019s perception of pr*stitutes gradually changed, and they got paid more, so they had more leeway financially.So much so that if you were a Courtesan, you could have a fortune of your own.\u201c\u2026 Haishin-sama, where are you? I wish to thank you for everything\u2026\u201dWe don\u2019t know about pr*stitutes in other countries, but at least the treatment of Kanna and other pr*stitutes in the Royal Capital was unparalleled.Soon after, all the women working in the brothel began to worship Haishin.They truly believed that because of his voice, because he said that much, that\u2019s why the country moved.[You want to hear what happened? Well, I\u2019m still wondering how I should say it, you know? Anyways, I\u2019m glad you guys are here and sorry to the people who think I\u2019m a bit of a pain in the a*s, though it\u2019s a little late for that!]\u201cHa\u2026?\u201dKanna, who had been about the past earlier, frowned at Haishin\u2019s words.\u201cPeople who think Haishin-sama is a pain\u2026? Who are they?\u201dShe was a beautiful woman who gave men dreams as a Courtesan, but now she was like a god of death born from the abyss.Incidentally, it wasn\u2019t only Kanna, but the women in the brothel that were equally outraged. There was no end to the talk about who was the infidel that had pestered him.~~~~~~~~~~~~\u201cWhat a coincidence, Kanata-kun!\u201d\u201cEh? Oh, yeah\u2026 That\u2019s right.\u201dA few days after Aguila became a pissy little boy, Kanata bumped into Maria on her day off, dressed in casual clothes.It was quite fresh to see her in a cute white one-piece instead of a tight-fitting uniform.\u201cAre you looking for something?\u201d\u201cWell, come with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata wondered whether a princess of a country was allowed to go out alone, but when she lived in a girl\u2019s dormitory in the first place, Kanata had no reason to deny it.\u201c\u2026 Well, I\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d\u201cWait a minute!\u201dShe grabbed him by the wrist with a jerk.To tell the truth, Kanata was concerned about how Maria had been following him a lot since the incident with Aguila.Her suspicious gaze, the way she shook her head thinking it was impossible, the look that seemed to be expecting something. Kanata could not help but feel uneasy.Moreover, seeing Kanata and Maria like that, Alphana only smiled happily, and there was no one anywhere to help them.\u201cWhat if you\u2019re not busy?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going out!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata sighed as there didn\u2019t seem to be a way to escape.But it was just then.\u201cLet go of me.\u201d\u201cOh, come on, I\u2019m a Xandardian nobleman. You can\u2019t act like that.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. What\u2019s the point of being an aristocrat if you don\u2019t know how to act like one?\u201dThey saw a man dressed in expensive clothes catching a beautiful woman with bright red hair in front of them.The woman didn\u2019t seem to like it, and the man seemed more persistent. Kanata and Maria looked at each other and nodded.\u201cWhat are you doing, brother?\u201d\u201cGet your hands off her.\u201dIt was the moment they had to give up on their holiday.TLN:[1] dondon-pafupafu; its drum beats with the sound of trumpets, kinda means \u201clet\u2019s get started\u201d better to watch the following video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osfq97vSRrgUpdate- from now on the release will be every monday & friday.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: Even if you explain to an idiot, they\u2019ll remain an idiot\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, brother?\u201d\u201cGet your hands off her.\u201dKanata, accompanied by Maria, intervened between the two.The woman widened her eyes in surprise, but the man turned his sharp gaze at the two who had intervened.\u201cWhat the f**k are you guys? Get out of my way!\u201dAside from Kanata, it is extremely disrespectful to say such a thing to Maria, the Kingdom\u2019s princess, but well. You wouldn\u2019t expect the princess to be there in the first place, right?Nevertheless, the women, including those around her, seem to be aware of Maria.Maria didn\u2019t want it to be too noisy, but still, it was inevitable now that the princess had intervened.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to like it. Aren\u2019t you ashamed to be a man?\u201d\u201cOhh? \u2026 What\u2019s this? Aren\u2019t you a cutie yourself?\u201dThe man reached for Maria, but she clapped his hands with a snap.Then, as a matter of course, the man recoiled, but Kanata put his hand on his shoulder.\u201cCalm your head down for a moment.\u201d\u201cYou!?\u201dThe very next moment, the man instantly fell to his knees.What Kanata did was simple. He put the magic power in his palm and released it the moment he touched the man as it was.It was as if he got pressured with magic, and Kanata\u2019s unlimited magic power alone could pin an adult male to the ground.\u201c\u2026 Filth! Do you have any idea who you\u2019re doing this to!?\u201d\u201cNo idea. I don\u2019t know anything about the nobility of the Empire. In this case, it doesn\u2019t matter if I knew or not.\u201d\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201dKanata heard him as he yelled, but he had no reason to be afraid.Sure. It might be risky to pick a fight with a noble from the Empire, but this is the Kingdom, not the Empire.And many witnessed that the guy was clearly worse this time.\u201cThat\u2019s true. I don\u2019t know how it is in the Empire, but here, there is no rule that says you can\u2019t go against an aristocrat from the Empire. Well, it depends on the occasion, but\u2026 in this case, we\u2019re dealing with a man of poor quality, so there\u2019s no need to be shy.\u201d\u201cNonsense, you f*****g b***h!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me telling you to calm down?\u201d\u201cGuh\u2026 damn it!\u201dOnce again, the man tried to face Maria, but Kanata tapped on his shoulder. He fell to the ground in an even more unceremonious manner than before.He stared at Kanata in desperation as he fell, but he didn\u2019t care at all.\u201cKanata-kun, you have quite a bit of magic power, after all.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yeah.\u201d\u201cFufu, sounds like you\u2019ve got a secret, huh?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe found Maria happily smiling as she said so.But Kanata couldn\u2019t tell that it wasn\u2019t a pure smile, but a smile that even could give him some chills.\u201cYou people are\u2026\u201dThen, finally, the woman spoke up.Kanata turned his attention and gazed at her as if he thought his heart might get stolen, even if it were only for a moment.Her beautiful crimson hair and uneven body, as well as her appearance and even the aura she exudes, were so complete as a woman that they created a bewitching atmosphere.(\u2026 Is it possible for such beauty to exist? As expected of another world.)Maria and Alphana are no slouches in looks, but\u2026 the atmosphere she bought was just too erotic.She was wearing a pitch-black dress, but the cleavage of her ample bosom was visible, and it was certainly not surprising that she would be approached persistently by people from other countries.\u201cThat man was. He was trying to buy me.\u201d\u201cBuying\u2026 Ah. Maybe you\u2019re the one called a courtesan?\u201d\u201cYeah. But in this case, he was trying to be undertaking.\u201dHe wanted to pay a woman with money and keep her with him.If this woman is a prostitute, she would have wished to be taken in by a nobleman\u2026 Well, it seems she refused him because he was such a waste of a nobleman.Being a prostitute is an accepted profession these days. It is heavily supported by the state.(Courtesan\u2026 Well, I\u2019ve talked about them before.)Kanata remembered what he had said about prostitutes earlier in his podcast.He was irritated at the time by the mindless mail, but he had received many appreciations from women he thought were prostitutes in the mail that he had failed to introduce ever since.It was a really nice experience to hear that his words gave them the courage and will to survive.\u201c\u2026 This!\u201d\u201cAn?\u201dAs he was thinking back, the man started shouting.\u201cI told her I\u2019d like to keep her because I liked her! And she had the nerve to turn me down! I gave my attention to a piece of trash, a w***e, and she made fun of me!!!\u201dEveryone was appalled at who in the world was the real trash there.However, at the word \u201ctrash,\u201d Maria and the woman frowned, and Kanata crouched down and looked into the man\u2019s face.\u201cProstitutes are trash? \u2026 How dare you say that?\u201d\u201cYou got a problem with that?\u201d\u201cOf course I have.\u201dKanata spoke up.He made eye contact with the man and didn\u2019t turn away.\u201cProstitutes aren\u2019t trash. They are admirable people who give men dreams.\u201d\u201c!?\u201d\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe woman gasped, and Maria kept staring at Kanata in admiration.Kanata continued speaking without noticing the two of them.\u201cI ain\u2019t that familiar with them\u2026 but I know one thing. I\u2019m sure they take pride in their work. It\u2019s a great job to provide healing and warmth to any person you meet with sincerity. I\u2019m a man, but I respect them from the bottom of my heart.\u201dBecause he is a man, he can never truly understand what it\u2019s like to be a woman.Even so, Kanata knew that the brothel in the royal capital was quite famous and that the service was excellent.Once considered the lowest of the low, these prostitutes are recognized by their country now.\u201cI don\u2019t even know your name, Nobleman of the Empire. I don\u2019t think my words will impact you, but let me tell you this\u2014 Don\u2019t talk about these ladies like that.\u201dKanata said this firmly because what he once commented about prostitutes made a big change for good.Soon after, the guards came and took the man away.Well, it looked like he would be released soon since he didn\u2019t commit a crime, but he still had to leave the royal capital soon.\u201c\u2026? What\u2019s up?\u201dAfter the man got taken away, Kanata was confused by Maria and the courtesan staring at him.\u201c\u2026 I knew it. That\u2019s why Alphana.\u201d\u201cMaria?\u201d\u201cNah, it\u2019s nothing\u2026 fufu\u2026 pffffft \u266a.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dMaria suddenly burst out laughing, which was weird, to say the least.He almost took a little distance from Maria, but the woman approached him before he could.\u201cThank you. It was nice to hear you say it like that.\u201d\u201cNo, I just said what was on my mind.\u201dKanata was not trying to show the woman a good point but was really just saying what he was thinking about prostitutes.Then the woman asked to see his hand.\u201c?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata held out his hand, and she gently wrapped it in both of hers, looking at the back and front of her hand and shaking her body as if she had noticed something.\u201cIt\u2019s Kanna.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cMy name, please, is what I want you to call me from now on.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Erm.\u201dKanata was thinking about how, for some reason, the woman, Kanna, was too kind to look at him.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Kanata.\u201d\u201cKanata-kun\u2026 fufu. You see, I\u2019ve been with many men, so I\u2019m confident in my ability to recognize them.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dKanata tilted his head, wondering what on earth she was talking about.Kanna was about to leave, saying she had work to do now, but she took a piece of paper from her chest and handed it to Kanata.\u201cWith it, you can visit me at any time. Just show it to the receptionist at the brothel where I work, and he\u2019ll get you in immediately. In case you ever want me to heal you, you won\u2019t need to pay me.\u201d\u201c!?\u201dKanna walked away with a giggle.When she whispered in his ear, he felt as if she had grabbed his heart, but\u2026 Kanata decided not to think about it anymore.\u201c\u2026 She\u2019s so cunning, that girl.\u201d\u201cMaria?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I have to talk to Alphana about some things.\u201d\u201cAnd what is it about\u2026\u201dKanata let out a sigh, feeling accomplished but strangely tired.~~~~~~~~The man who was courting Kanna got extradited to the Empire.However, he didn\u2019t like the fact that Kanata got the better of him because he was a proud nobleman.He managed to learn some things while he got held down and when he was being taken away by the guards.(I didn\u2019t expect a princess\u2026 but not that commoner. He mocked me!)All the anger he harboured got directed at Kanata.He couldn\u2019t stop being angry at him for interfering with him and making him look disgraceful despite being a commoner.\u201cKanata, a commoner living in the Royal Capital\u2026 Kuku, that\u2019s all you need to know.\u201dThe man muttered triumphantly and stepped into despair himself.\u201cAre you the client?\u201d\u201cRaven, I have a request for you.\u201dAa~ah, you\u2019ve done it, you idiot.He could hear it coming from somewhere.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: Gachi-Love Should Be ()That evening, she immediately went to visit Alphana.\u201cAlphana!\u201d\u201cAra, what\u2019s the hurry\u2026 is it about Kanata-sama?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yeah\u2026 yeah, that\u2019s right! That reaction, perhaps\u2026 That\u2019s not what I mean\u2026 but that is okay, right? Is that how it is supposed to be, right? Hey, just tell me already, hey!\u201d\u201cS-stop shaking me so much!\u201dWith a look one could describe as delirious, Maria questioned her.As she grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her body in a fit of panic, Alphana\u2019s huge b*****s, which were ill-proportioned to her petite body, bounced in tandem with one another.\u201cKanata-kun\u2026 No, Kanata-sama is Haishin-sama, right?\u201d\u201cT-that\u2019s right! So please calm down!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way I can calm down like this!! Because\u2026 because!!!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Oh my god, this princess is so annoying!!!!\u201dUnable to resist, Alphana pushed Maria\u2019s body with a thud.Maria also belatedly realized that she had annoyed Alphana. She inhaled and exhaled deeply to calm herself down.\u201dWell, I haven\u2019t confirmed it in person, but he\u2019s definitely Haishin-sama.\u201d\u201cI thought he might be different because his voice changes a little when he streams through the terminal\u2026 But the way he spoke reminded me of Haishin-sama.\u201dIt was something that was obvious after a bit of thinking, but even so, for Maria, the Haishin\u2019s presence was more important than anything else.That\u2019s why she always fantasized about how happy it would be if she could be by his side. She even wished for everything he says on his streams to be directed only at her.\u201c\u2026 Haishin-sama\u2026 Kanata-sama \u266a.\u201d\u2018Which of the two names is better to call him?\u2019 As she was thinking, she felt a current run through her body.Haishin is a pseudonym he uses, and his real name is Kanata.In other words, Maria knows Kanata\u2019s real name\u2026 \u2018Oya, that means we\u2019re now a married couple.\u2019Maria\u2019s thoughts leapt to that point.\u201cWhat shall I do, Alphana? When shall I arrange the marriage with Kanata-sama?\u201d\u201cAhaha. Don\u2019t be silly.\u201dBy the way, without a doubt, Alphana had this thought that she was the one who was going to marry Kanata.Well. Maria was tripping over many facts, but if left alone, she might use her privileges as a princess to the fullest and go berserk, so Alphana decided to nail her down before that happened.\u201cMaria, there is something that you need to know.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dEven though Alphana gave off an air of seriousness, Maria\u2019s mouth was still as loose as ever.Alphana clucked her tongue, uncharacteristic of her saintly manner, at what was happening before her. Then pinched both of her loose cheeks.\u201cAhh!?\u201d\u201cHe is indeed Haishin-sama, but the one who\u2019s by our side now is not Haishin-sama, but Kanata-sama. Don\u2019t forget that\u2026 If you cause him any trouble, even if it\u2019s you, I won\u2019t forgive you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMaria had no choice but to calm down once she got told that much.What Alphana said was this\u2014 Kanata is definitely the person they know as Haishin, but he is actually Kanata, and Haishin is just a name he uses in streaming.That\u2019s why Alphana thinks that Kanata should not experience any inconvenience by being treated as a Haishin.\u201cHaishin-sama\u2019s name is quite famous. We, as well as the leading figures of the Kingdom and other countries, have listened to him. However, regrettably, it is also true that there are those who are trying to eliminate him.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I know.\u201dHaishin has indeed become an immensely influential figure.However, when the influence is so strong that even a single word can move a country, there are forces that consider it an abomination and seek to eliminate it.Right now, it\u2019s like he is protected because they didn\u2019t know that Kanata is Haishin yet.\u201cIt is only by chance that we noticed him\u2026 Fufu, though we should not celebrate as our slightest carelessness may cause Kanata-sama troubles.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I see. Indeed, it\u2019d be embarrassing if I were the only one to celebrate.\u201dAlphana nodded, satisfied with Maria\u2019s response.Then, with a grin, she suggested to Maria \u2014like a demon comforting a troubled little child\u2014 putting her face close to Maria\u2019s ear and whispered.\u201cBut since it\u2019s just us who knows about this, I think we are the only ones who can support him.\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dMaria looked at Alphana in a huff.She\u2019s right. Only a limited number of people knew the truth about Haishin.Maria, Alphana, and Kanna were about the only ones\u2026 at present.\u201cIf anything were to happen, I, as a saint, and Maria, the princess, can be a great help. Is there no doubt about that?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 That\u2019s right.\u201dThat was certainly true.Maria, the princess, and Alphana, the saint, were influential in the Kingdom and, to some extent, in other countries.They are in a position to influence people in the face of whatever forces are in front of them.\u201c\u2026 Well, I\u2019d like to talk to him at some point. By the way, did you notice? In all the talks we had until now, when the topic of Haishin-sama came up, Kanata-sama has been a little uptight.\u201d\u201cEh? Really?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hmm, Maria is not very observant.\u201dNo, it\u2019s usually something you don\u2019t notice, but\u2026 Alphana just sees too much of it.\u201cI\u2019m sure Kanata-sama thinks he wouldn\u2019t get noticed, and maybe that\u2019s what Haishinsha is all about in the first place. Being exposed to their identities creates a lot of uncertainty\u2026 That\u2019s what I mean.\u201d\u201c\u2026 True. Alphana\u2019s right.\u201dSo Alphana held up a finger.\u201cTherefore! We have to support Kanata-sama from the shadows so that he will not get exposed as Haishin-sama. That is how we, as fans of Haishin-sama, should be, now that we have become aware of his identity.\u201d\u201cThat is how a fan should be\u2026\u201dMaria murmured admiringly at Alphana\u2019s words.They were troublesome followers before, but it was apparently not going to be the case anymore.These girls are prime examples of ideal fans, standing by Kanata, the Haishinsha, while clearly understanding what is and isn\u2019t good and trying to support him from behind the scenes.\u201cMaria, we are comrades. Let us support Kanata-sama as best as we can.\u201d\u201cYeah. I get it, Alphana! We\u2019re comrades!\u201dBehold a beautiful friendship in plain sight.As a princess and a saint, two friends who have been helping each other for a long time, they decided to join hands for the sake of one man.Oh, no, but the friendship of these wonderful ladies is a bit\u2026(That said, Kanata-sama\u2019s number one is me, Maria.)(Ufufu \u266a, but I\u2019ll become Kanata-kun\u2019s number one, Alphana.)What a beautiful day\u2026 Ah, it was night.While the two of them were smiling, holding each other\u2019s hands, deep in their hearts, they had similar desires.Although they said they\u2019ll work together in order to support Kanata, within their minds, they both were aiming for his heart.That was a given because these girls were truly in love with him.\u201c\u2026 Anyways, Maria, I just noticed you\u2019re quite something, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Though you\u2019re a bit more than that, Alphana.\u201dThey looked at each other and picked up their terminals as if it was about time.Since both of them were in Alphana\u2019s room, they listened to his voice from her terminal.[Hey, guys! It\u2019s that time of the day again!]\u201cHaishin-samaaaaaaah!\u201d\u201cLove you, muaaaahhhh!\u201dNo longer needing to hide anything, they relaxed and listened to the podcast as if they were out of restraints.Thus, in a sense, the movement surrounding Kanata began in earnest.Only in the future would his immense popularity as Haishin form a small community that will grow so huge that it will become a big swell.~~~~~~~~~~~Unknown to the fact that the princess and the saint had joined hands, Kanata continued to stream as he relaxed.Many things happened in the Royal Capital, such as Kanata\u2019s encounter with Maria, Alphana, and Kanna.\u201cIf you could just give me a minute.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dUntil one day, Kanata got called out.He turned around to find a person, a lady, quite tall for a woman, maybe ten centimetres taller than Kanata.She dressed in clothes that were neither too flashy nor too plain, but one which still did not lessen her feminine beauty. Her eyes seemed impatient as she looked at Kanata while fidgeting.\u201c\u2026 Is something wrong?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 will, you\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Can you show me the way here?\u201dKanata nodded at the sudden request for directions, which he thought was unusual.[Postscript]I actually had doubts that it would not be a good idea to stream in another world, but I\u2019m glad to know that so many people are reading this.Thank you so much.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: Some people are happy that things are going well for youThe tall, beautiful lady who appeared in front of Kanata to ask for directions didn\u2019t mention where she wanted to go.If she had told him, he would have been able to tell her how to get there or guided her himself.\u201cFumu, this is quite interesting. So this is what they call the royal capital.\u201d\u201cIs this your first time here?\u201d\u201cUmu. First time in human residences\u2026 Ahm, I mean, I\u2019ve never been here before.\u201dAlthough her long jet-black hair and blood-red eyes made her look like an evil witch, she looked like a belle to Kanata because her beauty was on the same level as Maria, Alphana, Kanna, and the others, even though they were different types of women.\u201cSorry for causing you trouble for guiding such a small-town traveller.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it. Instead, it\u2019s my pleasure to be invited by such a beautiful lady.\u201dWhat a thing to say when you have no intention of doing so.Kanata talked with a stern expression, but the woman didn\u2019t react in particular and just stared back at him with wide eyes.Kanata felt a massive sense of remorse in his heart that he had missed again because of her no-reaction.From then on, he showed her around and came to a higher altitude where they could see the entire cityscape.\u201c\u2026 And here I was trying to destroy such a magnificent sight!\u201d\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. Just a few things in my mind.\u201dThe woman said and turned to Kanata.So many people had their eyes stuck to her while they walked, and it was no wonder since she had a really well-defined, beautiful face to make them do so.Kanata felt nervous getting stared at like this. However, thanks to being with Maria and Alphana, he had developed some tolerance for beautiful ladies.(\u2026 Such a mysterious person. But I wonder if she\u2019s really a human?)Kanata was in wonder for a while now.The woman in front of him looked not much different from a human\u2026 It\u2019s just that her looks remained unreal for a human.She also had an aura that was subtly different from the people he had met so far.\u201cAre you\u2026 really a human?\u201dSo he asked out of curiosity, which made her widen her eyes in surprise and she replied,\u201cThanks to the magic item my subordinate gave me, I\u2019m supposed to have the exact same looks as a human, but I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d notice so soon. Perhaps, was it by love?\u201d\u201c\u2026 What do you mean?\u201d\u201cKukuku, by any means, it feels so good. I see~ it has to be!\u201dShe looked like any woman you\u2019d see blushing because she was happy.Kanata didn\u2019t know what to say in response, so he could only continue silently watching as she shook her shoulders and giggled.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was overjoyed.\u201d\u201cAnyways, that being said\u2026 you\u2019re not really a human?\u201dThe woman nodded to his question.After confirming that no one was around and that there were no magical surveillance spells at work, she removed the ring from her finger.At that moment, the woman unleashed an overwhelming demonic presence.It was the same presence as the man who had taken Aguila before, proof that the woman in front of him was a demon.\u201cLet me say my name once again. My name is Shrouza, a lowly demon.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Umm, and I\u2019m Kanata.\u201d\u201cKanata\u2026 huh? Umu\u2026 Is it okay if I call you that??\u201d\u201cEh? Yeah, it\u2019s fine.\u201dKanata had no problem whether anyone called him \u2018-san,\u2019 \u2018-kun,\u2019 or whatever.Shrouza then snapped her fingers, and the area surrounding them became black.\u201cWe\u2019re now disconnected from the outside world. As you can see, we\u2019re the only ones here.\u201d\u201cHeh\u2026 Magic like that exists?\u201dKanata also started studying magic when he came to the academy.There was a lot of magic in this world he didn\u2019t know about, which made Kanata\u2019s heart beat even faster in excitement.\u201c\u2026 So Kanata, Let me ask you one thing, what do you think of the Demonkind?\u201d\u201cDemons, you say?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dKanata pondered while crossing his arms, as the question was not something he had expected.When asked what he thought about the demons, he had none in particular, as he didn\u2019t know much about them in the first place.\u201cI personally don\u2019t think they\u2019re any different. It seems that humans and demons have been fighting each other for a long time, no idea why, since I don\u2019t know a thing about the past.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019d be better if they can get along, as it is better than fighting and having someone die. When someone dies, someone will get sad, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for demons, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s right. We cry when our friends die.\u201dBeing able to talk like this proves that the demons, too, have hearts.The story might have been different if Kanata hadn\u2019t reincarnated and was born in a world with mandatory education that stated demons are evil. However, Kanata never looked at one side over the other.\u201c\u2026 Kuku, you have a good eye.\u201d\u201cWhat about that?\u201d\u201cStill, Kanata, you\u2019ve got some serious magic power in you, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c!?\u201dThose were the words said with conviction.Basically, magic power is measured to know an individual\u2019s strength, but maybe demons could gauge the quality of others\u2019 magic power with their intuition.To back this up, Shoruza explained,\u201cWe demons can see the intensity of magic that an individual has. And Kanata, you hold far more magical power than I do. I never thought there was an individual like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 How much more does it look like?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Since I can\u2019t see the limit.\u201dApparently, she was aware of the limitless magical power that Kanata held.She couldn\u2019t see the limit, but she didn\u2019t seem to recognize it as infinite. She probably couldn\u2019t come up with the idea of infinite magic power.It was common sense in this world that there was no such thing as infinite magical power.\u201cI see\u2026 that makes sense.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hey, what have you been mumbling about for a while?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Talking to myself is my hobby.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dShrouza then walked up to Kanata and held out her brown-skinned hand, and Kanata naturally took it.\u201cKanata, you think the same, right? This is how demons and humans can work hand in hand.\u201d\u201cYeah, I know it\u2019s going to be hard. It may be a tough road, but I know we can do it.\u201d\u201cCertainly\u2026 that\u2019s how it has to be.\u201dThe hand he held was cold, but it was no different from a human\u2019s in any way.So Kanata decided to mention a name\u2014that of Haishin, whose name he believed must never get revealed.\u201cYou know, even Haishin, who\u2019s currently popular with humans, says that. I wonder how peaceful it would be if humans and demons could understand each other. Ah, also, I\u2019m one of those who wish for that.\u201dAs he told her that, she was taken aback for some reason, but soon, she shook her shoulders and burst out laughing.Kanata was worried that he might have said something strange, but Shrouza excused herself and apologized.\u201cI\u2019m a follower of Haishin too, you know? Surely I had the same thought\u2026 no, thanks to him, I began to think like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hey Shrouza, is Haishin famous on the demon\u2019s side?\u201d\u201cFamous? He\u2019s as famous as I am, but he\u2019s especially popular with the younger generation.\u201d\u201cI-is that so\u2026\u201d\u201cAlthough not popular with the hard-headed old men, I\u2019ve already started to clean them up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe felt like he had heard something he shouldn\u2019t have. Still, it made him happy to know he was also popular on the demon\u2019s side.To use an analogy from his previous life, it\u2019s the same as being told that he was popular not only in Japan but also overseas.\u201c\u2026 The Demon Land, huh? I wonder what kind of place it is?\u201d\u201cYou wanna come?\u201d\u201cEh? You can do that?\u201d\u201cUmu! You\u2019ll get a face pass if I\u2019m here!\u201d\u201cHey, so close! You\u2019re too close!\u201dKanata\u2019s heart beat loudly when Shrouza approached him close to his face.Somehow, he managed to put the matter to rest by saying he\u2019ll come the next time he had the chance.Shrouza then returned to the demon side after promising they would meet again. And thus, Kanata\u2019s mysterious day came to an end.It is known that a demon king exists, but nobody knows what their name is. Knowing a demon didn\u2019t mean they were a demon king, so Kanata was unaware of the obvious fact that Shrouza was the demon king.Well. A few days had passed since that encounter with Shrouza, and Kanata\u2019s days were still the same. He was also streaming today.[Well then, that\u2019s all for today! Everyone get some sleep~!]He said those words in the terminal, and his time as Haishin was over.Kanata stretched his arms and leaned back against the chair as hard as he could.At that moment, he saw it.\u201c\u2026 Eh\u201d\u201c\u2026 Fuhe \u266a.\u201dA woman dressed in black was stuck to the ceiling in a sprawling position, just like G, a terrifying presence that had terrorized people since ancient times in his previous life.She had a very well-defined face, but the way she looked at Kanata with a twisted smile ruined it all.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah, drool.\u201dDrool dripped from the woman\u2019s mouth. It fell straight down onto Kanata\u2019s forehead.Kanata couldn\u2019t react much and froze in place, but he gradually regained his composure and managed to open his mouth.\u201cWho in the world are you?\u201dWhen he asked that and pointed his finger at her, she landed beautifully on the ground with a move that would even make a gymnast wince.\u201cNice to meet you, Haishin-sama. I am not a suspicious person, but a fan!\u201dAnd Kanata retorted with tsukkomi, saying, \u201cWho are you to talk like that?\u201d[Postscript]Who she is and how she knows will be known next time!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: Fifth Believer, Mira aka Raven the AssassinRaven, an assassin, is a living legend in the Xandard Empire. The name didn\u2019t just refer to the individual but also described the occurrences they caused.Despite her low magical power, she has exceptionally high physical abilities and absolute invisibility that even the strongest beings couldn\u2019t detect.\u201cA commoner named Kanata\u2026 seems like an easy job.\u201dThat\u2019s what Raven thought when she received a request to kill a mere commoner, not a noble, a knight, a warrior, or an adventurer.The nobleman who made the request told her that he was humiliated by that commoner in the Royal Capital, so he wanted Raven to settle his grudge for him.\u201c\u2026 Well, it can\u2019t be helped. Let\u2019s just say this commoner ran out of luck. It\u2019s my job to fulfill the tasks as Raven\u2026 though there was once an exception.\u201dRaven muttered as she looked down at the streets of the Royal City and jumped down into the shadows of the buildings.Out of it came not the figure of a suspicious assassin dressed in black but a girl with a youthful face, with the beauty of a woman approaching perfection.\u201cAll right, let\u2019s start by gathering some information!\u201dRaven\u2014the name of the legendary assassin\u2014 was actually a girl that no one knew.In a sense, Raven\u2019s concealment skills could have started from that.And as usual, with the face of a young girl, Raven had no problem gathering information about Kanata from the Royal Capital.\u201cThat was quick. It pains me to take the life of an innocent, but since I\u2019ve already taken this task, I have to do it.\u201dIt\u2019s not that she was void of emotions as an assassin.Rather, it\u2019s a requirement for her profession.(I\u2019m Raven\u2026 a being who inherited the art of assassination, who can only live as Raven\u2026 an existence that is nothing but Raven.)Raven hated herself for being such an ambivalent person.As an assassin, she got accustomed to feeling no emotions, but there had been times when she had to stifle her heart in order to stain her hands with blood.Still, Raven had been masterfully completing her work as an assassin for a long time.But it all changed when she encountered that person who made her forget all her worries, as well as her own self, as an assassin.[Hey, guys! It\u2019s that time of the day again!]It was Haishin\u2014not exactly. It was his voice that sprouted the change in her.Even if she had the face of an assassin, she was still a girl of age on the inside, so it was only natural she was curious about the trends, and that is how she came to follow Haishin.And so, as the days went by listening to Haishin, Raven had a thought.As the girl hides her true identity as Raven, and Haishin also hides his true self, they had something in common, and she felt a closeness to him.[That\u2019s not it. I\u2019m not taking sides here, you idiots. You should listen to me from the beginning and have an opinion. Now, on to the next one.]After the mission was over, or even when there were no requests, listening to Haishin\u2019s voice had become a part of Raven\u2019s daily routine and a way of life.Raven was so captivated by Haisin that she herself never expected to be so addicted to him that she even had to turn away several calls for requests.[Let\u2019s see, there are many different sorts of professions, and there are those known as assassins in the underworld. What are your thoughts about them, Haishin-sama? \u2026 Another heavy question.]It was by no means a message sent by Raven herself, but it had surprised her enough to make her shoulders jolt.An assassin was an entity only those who desired something requested.Therefore, they are feared and despised.Even Raven understood she was not truly wanted by anyone.So if Haishin says something bad about them, that would be a shock, but Raven was never going to complain because that is common sense.[What do I think about assassins\u2026? Of course, I\u2019m scared of them.]She laughed emphatically, \u2018Scared? Of course.\u2019But, he was the one who had some sense of mystery about him, and Haishin further went on to say.[But personally, I think it\u2019s really cool. They\u2019re called Assassins, you know? They\u2019re the type who takes their target\u2019s breath away under the cloak of darkness.]Raven widened her eyes at his words.Many commenters weren\u2019t so sure about that, but they quickly filled with comments about how it was Haishin after all.[Still, even if I say assassins are cool, they\u2019re still criminals. It\u2019s probably impossible to accept it, and it\u2019s also impossible to take it in a positive way. But that\u2019s what I think about them, to be honest.]The topic of the assassin ended with those words, but all the time Raven spent in a daze hearing Haishin\u2019s words afterwards.Everything he said wasn\u2019t to endorse either side but just what he thought. However, Raven was fascinated by the depth of his open-mindedness\u2014As you can see, she was a very easy girl to win over.\u201cI\u2026 admire you, Haishin-sama. No, I love you.\u201dAnd that is how genuine love blossomed in her heart.Now, with Raven\u2019s past briefly described, the day she would meet her destiny was just around the corner.~~~~~~~\u201c\u2026 This must be the dormitory where he spends most of his time.\u201dWhether it was because he was a commoner or because he visited various stalls in the town, it was easy to gather information about Kanata and quickly identify his residence.She decided that it would be at night, and until then, she would pass the time as a harmless woman.Then time passed, and night fell. She dressed in her costume as a Raven and crept into Kanata\u2019s room, deploying her unparalleled invisibility.\u201cForgive me, Kanata, for this too shall be forever etched in my memory as my sin. You shall hate me for all eternity.\u201dWhen Kanata returned after supper, she immediately picked up her sword and was about to slit his neck, but\u2026 Huh, Raven stopped her hand.(\u2026 isn\u2019t it Haishin-sama?)How, no idea why, but Raven-chan had noticed.His voice was slightly different through the terminal and not so easy to spot, even if he projected his hands.Still, with a glance, Raven recognized Kanata as Haishin.(\u2026 Eh? Arey? What\u2019s going on? Am I dreaming?)Although her face was concealed by her black costume, she was in a panic.How did Raven recognize that Kanata was a Haishin in one shot? It was simply Raven\u2019s keen observation and good eyesight as an assassin that helped her to uncover Haishin\u2019s true identity.And the ultimate sign is his presence itself.Raven was skilled at erasing her presence, and at the same time, she was also one of the strongest human beings at sensing others\u2019 presence.The way Haishin breathed when he spoke and many other things were also factors that made her instantly recognize him as Haishin.\u201cAhh~ The food was delicious. Let\u2019s keep on streaming in this great mood!\u201d\u201c!?!?!?\u201dRaven-chan widened her eyes open.Although she was glued to the ceiling, she could still fool others\u2019 perceptions of her appearance by diminishing her presence to the utmost limit.She kept her eyes open, bloodshot and tearful, never blinking as she deployed a form of concealment that no one would notice.[Hey, guys, it\u2019s another day! Well, let\u2019s get right to it!]Raven felt like she was in heaven.She didn\u2019t expect to meet Haishin himself when she sneaked into her target\u2019s room.She already forwent the desire to kill Haishin or Kanata, and the request completely flew out of her mind.(Haishin-sama himself is streaming before my very eyes!)Though she was overflowing with emotions that made her want to scream all over the place, she didn\u2019t want to bother him as his follower. Rather, she even thought of hanging herself on the spot if she caused him trouble.(I\u2019m a true follower of Haishin-sama! I dare not to cause him trouble\u2026 That\u2019s why I have to keep staring at him like this!)\u2018\u2014No, you don\u2019t have to do that,\u2019 she heard from somewhere.As it was, the blissful time passed, and after finishing the streaming, Kanata drowsily fell into bed and went straight to sleep.\u201c\u2026 Ha-Haishin-sama\u2026 Fuhe\u266a.\u201dShe landed on the floor and stared at Kanata\u2019s sleeping face.She didn\u2019t move until the wee hours of the morning, and when Kanata was about to wake up, she deployed her hidden form again and disappeared.She is a being of darkness, and no matter how little sleep she gets at night, she doesn\u2019t have a body weak enough to get sick from just that.(I can watch him all the time. I can watch Haishin-sama\u2019s sleeping face for hours and hours and never get tired of it, and just looking at it makes my heart warm and fuzzy.)She was on a completely dangerous train of thought.For the next few days or so, she stayed in Kanata\u2019s room\u2026 Yeah, she watched him all the time in her invisible form.\u2026 And it was at that moment she couldn\u2019t help but loosen her expression.\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Fuhe \u266a.\u201dMore than being found, she was more than happy that Kanata recognized her and asked who she was, so she replied confidently.\u201cNice to meet you, Haishin-sama. I am not someone suspicious, but a fan!\u201d\u201cWho are you to talk like that?\u201dRaven\u2019s real name was Mira, and this was how she was able to have a conversation with the one she longed for.Well, it was natural, but needless to say, from Kanata\u2019s point of view, it was a heart-popping surprise, and soon Mira was down to her knees in front of Kanata.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: Are there things like Flaming in the other world?\u201cSo, you\u2026\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe girl on her knees looked up quickly at Kanata\u2019s call.She looked like a dog that missed its owner, and if she had a tail, it would be wagging by now.Still, the girl in front of him was a complete stranger, and moreover, she was the first person to know his secret\u2026 Kanata wondered what on earth he should do.\u201c\u2026 Who are you anyway?\u201d\u201cYes! My name is Mira! I have another name, um, do you know\u2026 Raven?\u201d\u201cA bird? \u2026 Oh, you mean Raven\u2026 yeah?\u201dNot the bird, but Raven. Kanata tilted his head.\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata stared at the woman in front of him, thinking and organizing the information briefly for the time being.The blue-coloured semi-long hair and slightly slanted eyes suit the young face well, which gave her a slight sense of innocence that made it hard to believe she snuck into his room.She was dressed in black from top to bottom with a robe so you couldn\u2019t see below her neck\u2026 Kanata widened his eyes as he thought about a \u2018black robe\u2019 and \u2018Raven\u2019 without believing she could be that person.\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to tell me that Raven\u2026 the assassin?\u201d\u201cYes! It\u2019s that Raven!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dRaven, that\u2019s the name of the legendary assassin.Their true identity is said to be unknown, and no one has ever seen what lies beneath their mask, but it\u2019s hard to believe that the assassin\u2019s true identity is that of a girl.Rather, no matter what face emerged from within, there was nothing to prove that this girl who called herself Mira was Raven in the first place.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2026 Why would such a legendary assassin sneak into my room and stalk me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m your fan!\u201d\u201c\u2026 This doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dIn both his previous and current life, it was Kanata\u2019s first time dealing with this sort of thing.He really didn\u2019t know how to treat her or what to do from now on.\u201c\u2026 Haishin-sama, is there any problem?\u201d\u201cYeah, there is a problem.\u201d\u201cAnd, am I the one who\u2019s causing it?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cYou understand very well what I\u2019m talking about, don\u2019t you?\u201d Kanata gave her that look, but to his surprise, she simply replied, \u201cUnderstood,\u201d and pulled out a short sword from her pocket.\u201c?\u201dThe shining silver blade of the sword was artistically beautiful, but if a sword were to get drawn before you, it\u2019s only natural you\u2019d take a step back. That\u2019s what Kanata did, and he took a fighting stance\u2026 but instead of pointing the sword at Kanata, she placed it on her neck.\u201cIt\u2019s time for me to end this life then. Farewell, Haishin-sama.\u201dHer voice was serious.Kanata involuntarily shouted for her to stop and held her hand firmly while shaking.She was about to cut her own throat and got a slight cut on her neck, from which the blood started to flow.\u201cWhat the h**l are you doing?\u201dKanata rushed over as quickly as he could and put a handkerchief to her neck.It was not deep, just a cut on the skin, but Kanata\u2019s heart was racing at the quintessential, undeterred suicide attempt.\u201cJust\u2026 put that sword down.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dKanata even felt fear at how obedient she was.It\u2019s as if she saw Kanata as an absolute being, and he even felt a kind of servility in her eyes.\u201c\u2026 Were you serious about that?\u201d\u201cYes. I meant it.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I caused you trouble, Haishin-sama. Since I\u2019m a nuisance to you, I don\u2019t deserve to live.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m so sick of this girl.\u201dHis honest words leaked out.She was probably the type who would gladly die if Kanata told her to\u2026 and she was really the first Kanata has ever known to act like that.\u2018I would die for you\u2026\u2019 She reminded him of the yandere and \u2018menhera\u2019 type women, and Kanata was seriously about to cry at the appearance of such a girl far beyond those levels.[EDN: \u2018Menhera\u2019 is a Japanese slang term referring to people with some mental illness or someone in need of mental health care.]\u201cIn any case, don\u2019t die. I mean. You sure caused me trouble, but\u2026 Oh my god, I can\u2019t even think straight.\u201d\u201cA-are you all right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And who\u2019s fault is it?\u201d retorted Kanata, holding his head.He slurped down the drink on the table and took a deep breath to calm himself down for once.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m going to tell you one more time, don\u2019t die. If you cut your neck, there will be a lot of blood.\u201d\u201cAh, then, out of Haishin-sama\u2019s sight\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the point\u2026! What the h**l is wrong with you?\u201dHe reminded her not to die again.He didn\u2019t really care where this stalker woman, a complete stranger, died, but now that he talked to her, it didn\u2019t feel right for her to tell him that she was going to die in a place he didn\u2019t see.\u201cLet me think\u2026\u201dOnce again, Kanata sat down in front of her.\u201cMira\u2026 right?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m also called Raven, but only you know my name at this point.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026 am I going to get killed because I know your secret or something?\u201d\u201cIf someone ever tries to harm you, I\u2019ll make them disappear first!\u201dKanata returned a dry smile when he couldn\u2019t get through to her.It\u2019s impossible to recognize such a person as a legendary assassin, but he wanted\u2026 something easy to prove it.Anything? When he asked her about it, she put her hand on her chin and came up with a suggestion.\u201cI\u2019m so good at erasing my presence\u2026 like this\u2014\u201d\u201c\u2026 Wha?\u201dThe moment Mira muttered that, she disappeared into thin air.There was no sign of invoking magic, and he couldn\u2019t sense any flow of magic power, so Mira didn\u2019t cast any spells.Sure she was there, but yet her presence disappeared.\u201cAh, I\u2019m right in front of Haishin-sama.\u201d\u201cSeriously?\u201dHe did hear a voice out of nowhere.Perhaps she had not disappeared\u2026 or maybe she indeed had, but she was still sitting there as ever.The scary thing was that he thought he heard a voice, but he had no idea where it was coming from, so he reached out to his front\u2014 then touched something soft and fluffy.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my breast.\u201d\u201c!?\u201dQuickly, Kanata withdrew his hand.He hadn\u2019t noticed the black robe, but she seemed to have great things like Maria and Alphana.Kanata apologized, and Mira appeared in front of him as before.\u201cI\u2019m happy just to be touched by Haishin-sama\u2019s, so it\u2019s totally fine!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBeyond the embarrassment and awkwardness, he was exhausted.Kanata then calmed down to some extent and asked why she came here and how she knew that Haishin was Kanata in the first place.\u201cIt\u2019s unforgivable now, but I, as a Raven, was asked to get rid of Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Really? That\u2019s Haishin\u2026 No, it doesn\u2019t sound like you didn\u2019t know I\u2019m Haishin, right?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. My employer is a noble of no importance from the Xandard Empire, and he said Kanata-sama made him look ugly in this city.\u201dA noble of the Xandard Empire.Kanata got the pinprick after hearing that.What came to his mind was the nobleman he had dealt with when he saved Kanna, and he thought that perhaps the noble was the one who had arranged the assassination against Kanata.\u201c\u2026 You can\u2019t just kill someone for that thing.\u201d\u201cWell, he seemed proud. So, I came to this royal city and tracked down this place using your name. I never dreamed that I would meet Master Haisin\u2026 I am so happy!\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026 That\u2019s great.\u201dNo exactly\u2026 Kanata was terrified and shuddered at the prospect of being killed by her if he had made a mistake.However, he felt like he recognized this world again, although he didn\u2019t want to admit that this is also something unique to other worlds.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to kill me now?\u201d\u201cNot at all! I\u2019d rather protect you!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Sure, as a bodyguard\u2026 no, but I don\u2019t want any perverts.\u201dHe would feel safer if Raven, the legendary assassin, protected him, but he could feel a lot of perversity in her attitude. He could see something outlandish about her, which made her too scary to be around.\u201c\u2026?\u201dJust then, Kanata\u2019s terminal glowed.It was a message he got from his stream, so Kanata read it because she wanted to calm down a little more.\u201c\u2026 Eh.\u201d\u201cHaishin-sama?\u201dThe contents of the letters were as follows\u2026\u201cHaishin, you sure are a mass murderer.I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d go so far out of your way to be popular.I will not allow that.Since it takes a large amount of magic power to reach a wide area, a single person would quickly wither away no matter how much magic power they possess.That means you\u2019re using humans as your magic source for the streaming\u2026 Hey Haishin, how many humans have you killed by now?How much sacrifice and suffering did you make them endure to establish that position?I will not allow it. I\u2019m coming to bring you down to justice.\u201dKanata widened his eyes, wondering what in the world he was talking about, but wherever it originated, the word seemed to have spread in a certain way.The existence of infinite magical power wasn\u2019t known, and the only one who knew about it was Kanata himself.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s going to be a pain.\u201d\u201cHaishin-sam, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dKanata looked at the trespasser, who was staring at him with concern and let out a sigh, wondering what to do.Even in his previous life, small rumours spreading on the internet led to speculation, and it was not uncommon for celebrities to get labelled in strange ways\u2026 It seems that this has come down to Kanata as a Haishin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: Standing up to the slanderHaishin had become a big name in the world of Ataraxia.The culture of streaming he created had a minor presence at first, but it steadily spread among people and became the big swell it now was.[If you\u2019ve got anything to say, just tell me, and I\u2019ll read it. I can\u2019t wait to hear from you guys!]Haishin\u2019s voice was that of a teenager, but the way he looked at things and had values like that of an adult.His pioneering of information delivery, which no one had ever done before, and his boldness in taking a scalpel to the world\u2019s conventions in a matter-of-fact manner gained him great popularity.[I\u2019m just saying what I want to say. No one\u2019s telling me what to say. I\u2019m just doing it because I feel like it.]It was an experiment never attempted before, and people across Ataraxia got drawn to him because he was something they hadn\u2019t seen before.The person behind Haishin only said what he wanted to say, and his voice also had a certain charisma, despite the fact that he was uttering his words according to the values he held in his previous life\u2026He became a social phenomenon.But naturally, there were many who were jealous of his power to influence even countries just by talking, and there were idiots who tried to do the same thing he did.\u201c\u2026 Hey, this is not enough magic, you piece of s**t!\u201d\u201cF-forgive me\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re all useless f*cking worms!\u201dIt was a scene at a nobleman\u2019s mansion in a small country.The nobleman holding a terminal in his hand yelled at the many slaves waiting behind him.He was trying to imitate Haishin, but he wasn\u2019t able to supplement with his magical power alone. When he thought about how to remedy it, he came up with the idea of buying a large number of slaves and sucking all the magical power out of them.\u201c\u2026 Haah\u2026 Haah.\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026 not anymore\u2026\u201dIn the world of Ataraxia, the magic power that flows through the body is an important thing that allows it to exist, whether a lot or a little, and it is the same thing as blood.If one forcefully extracted that magic power, it would naturally deplete their vitality, causing them to become exhausted to where they would lose consciousness, or worse, even death, which was rare.\u201cAre there no other slaves?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all we bought today, Sir.\u201d\u201cDamn. I guess a bunch of bottom-feeding slaves only have this much magic power.\u201dThe law against slaves had passed, and it certainly made the world a better place for slaves to live in.But it\u2019s also true there were still those who did what they wanted in hidden places like this, and it\u2019s not as if all slaves could get saved.If this were a kingdom, empire, or principality, a place where the name of Haishin was deeply ingrained, it would be a major crime, but\u2026 apparently, the country this nobleman was in was not.\u201cDamn\u2026 I can\u2019t do it like Haishin. No matter how much magic power I collect, it\u2019s not enough. Just how many does that sonovabetch have, un?\u201dIt was a naive way of thinking, but in a way, he could only come up with this understanding because he didn\u2019t know Haishin\u2019s secret\u2026 No, Kanata\u2019s.\u201cJust how many does he sacrifice to be able to do one stream?\u201dSo he came to that conclusion.In case you were wondering, he also had adventurers with high magic ranks cooperate with him in what he called an experiment, but not even SS ranks lasted more than a few minutes. Thus, he thinks that Haishin might be SSS rank or have a usually high amount of magic.However, the calculation results showed that no matter how far they held, they would not be able to hold onto enough for an hour.\u201cThe b*****d from Haishin talks for two hours at the longest\u2026 Impossible. It\u2019s impossible for an ordinary person, and there\u2019s no way he can generate that much magic power on his own. He must\u2019ve been doing some outrageous things behind that mask!\u201dThat was still a guess, but\u2026 it was how the speculation about Haishin started.In this world, infinite magic power is beyond belief, and all living creatures, large and small, have some magic power that will inevitably run out.\u201cKukuku, I don\u2019t know why no one has ever thought about this before, but I\u2019m going to expose the evil of Haishin. Hey, Haishin, this is as high as you can get. I\u2019m going to drag you down from your crown.\u201dHe, too, apparently knew that spreading negative publicity would hurt him, given that even in this small country, the influence of Haishin\u2019s name was insane.Yet he decided to step on the tail of the sleeping tiger.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s see what I can do.\u201dKanata muttered to himself as he sat on a bench in the courtyard after his classes were over.The matter of the mail that read after his sudden encounter with Mira had caused a ripple effect that was by no means small.He was often asked how he could broadcast to so many people, but Kanata never gave any particular answer.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s just a matter of time before it catches fire.\u201dThe infinite magical power that resided in his body after reincarnating in this world was truly unique.Since he had no limit for his magic power, he could perform any sort of advanced magic without stopping. Above all, he was immune to traps and things that drained magic power in dungeons. He could even crush anyone with just his absolute magic power alone\u2026However, even if he told people he had unlimited magic power, they may still not believe him.\u201cWell, it\u2019s better not to talk about unlimited magic power. It\u2019ll definitely get me into more trouble.\u201dAs he had said many times before, Kanata was fine with just being able to stream.In his previous life, there was a saying in the online world that said, \u2018do what you love and live for it.\u2019 That was exactly what Kanata was doing.Fortunately, there weren\u2019t many bad rumours about Haishin, but it seemed that some country was spreading the word that Haishin was piling up evil deeds, and I was afraid that it would become a loud voice and lead to further flaming of some sort.\u201cSorry to keep you waiting, Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201cWhoa!\u201d\u201cIs something bothering you?\u201dBefore he knew it, Mira appeared seated next to him.She looked at him curiously, wondering what was wrong, but she held out several sheets of paper from her pocket and handed it to Kanata.\u201cI have gathered some information on my own. I had to use force to some extent, but if it is for Kanata-sama\u2019s sake, there is no need to be stingy with it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see. Thank you, Mira.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cMira?\u201dShe widened her eyes, and then just like that, her eyes went white, and she stopped moving.He knew there wasn\u2019t anything to worry about her as she\u2019d recover in a minute, so he looked at the papers she handed him.There was a detailed record of the information that Mira had collected, and it seemed that a certain nobleman in the small country of Senshi, which is quite far from here, was the source of the rumours.Moreover, not only the aristocrats but also many people who were jealous of Haishin gathered to form an organization of their own\u2026Kanata sighed.\u201cEven so, I can\u2019t believe you gathered this much information so quickly\u2026 as expected of the legendary Raven.\u201dKanata\u2019s encounter with Mira was so abrupt that he had yet to figure out how to interact with her.\u201cIs there something I can do? Just say the word, and I\u2019ll gather some information.\u201d\u201cCan you do it?\u201d\u201cWith ease.\u201dWith that, Mira disappeared from the room and had just returned.As for Mira, she just wanted to help Kanata, her beloved Haishin-sama.Kanata didn\u2019t expect her to come back so quickly with all the information compiled together, and her specs as Raven were so high that he was tongue-tied.\u201cHe speaks warmly of his slaves, but that is a lie, and in fact, he uses them to compensate for the depletion of his magic power\u2026 That\u2019s how he came up with such bullshit.\u201dHer words continued further.\u201c\u2018All those who support Haishin got brainwashed, and the only way to end the tyranny is to choke Haishin out as soon as possible\u2026\u2019 Haha.\u201dKanata let out a dry laugh.There are definitely some fans who say dangerous things, but Kanata did not brainwash them\u2026 Above all, Kanata conveyed his gratitude for what they said. He didn\u2019t like it when his followers got referred to like that.\u201cSo they believe I\u2019m forcing the magic power out of others. Well, not many people are taking these guys at their word\u2026 Oh yeah, this must be Slandering as they say.\u201dNot that he was visibly hurt, but he understood very well through social networking sites in his previous life that if you let these things go, they can be troublesome.But words were meaningless.He needed to show it in some understandable way\u2026 so Kanata had to stream.\u201cI wonder if this is where the technology of projecting images comes into play. The quickest way to do that would be to use the magic measuring tool, but\u2026 Hmm\u2026\u201dThere is a magic measuring orb in your hand when you enter the academy, and it is quicker to prove himself by putting all his energy into it.At SSS rank, it lights up a lot.It is likely that the orb will shatter if unlimited magical power is poured into it, but if the result gets recognized as the secret of Haishin\u2019s magic power, which is an unlikely event, then all the better.\u201cHowever, that orb can\u2019t be taken out, and if you shatter it\u2026\u201dAfter thinking about it, Kanata came up with an idea.And just in time, the two girls appeared on the scene.\u201cKanata-kun\u2026\u201d\u201cKanata-sama\u2026\u201dSomewhat worried about Kanata, a slight feeling of anger flared in their eyes.He tilted his head and wondered why they were there, but putting that aside, he was relieved to see Mira, who had disappeared before him knowing, and after confirming that there was no one else around, he opened his mouth.\u201cI have a favour to ask you\u2026 is that okay?\u201dMaria and Alphana were greatly surprised by what followed next.Kanata mentioned that name.\u201cSorry about the suddenness\u2026 but the truth is, Haishin is actually me.\u201dKanata mouthed this to the two of them, lightheartedly to all intents and purposes.They told him they were fans of Haishin, so he decided to rely a little bit on their status and the fact that they\u2019re close friends these days.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: The reliable Princess and the Saint\u201cI\u2019m Haishin,\u201d he told them, to which Maria and Alphana were stunned.Kanata smiled at that, but at the same time, he thought that he might have made a mistake.(That\u2019s what happens when you suddenly get told a secret, right? I mean, it\u2019s not about being a princess or a saint, but they\u2019ve considered me a friend, so I think it\u2019s much of a surprise to tell them.)Kanata had already told them that he was Haishin, though.Whether this was true or false, Kanata could no longer escape.The first one to speak up was Alphana, despite the fact that the girls were quite scared of how they would respond to Kanata\u2026\u201c\u2026 Um, I\u2019m sorry Kanata-sama. Actually, Maria and I were aware of it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 huh?\u201dKanata sounded distracted at Alphana\u2019s words.Maria, who stood beside her, also nodded awkwardly, and Kanata sat there hemming and hawing, saying seriously.\u201c\u2026 Since when?\u201d\u201cThe very day I met you, Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201cThe day we encounter the lady courtesan.\u201dAside from Maria, Alphana seems to have been aware of it for quite some time.Kanata had thought that absolutely no one had found out about him, and thus more than a counter to his own confession came out.\u201c\u2026 I see. You found out\u2026 but how did you know? Mira\u2026 no, you didn\u2019t go through my room or anything, did you?\u201dHe almost mentioned Mira\u2019s name for a moment, but he didn\u2019t think they snuck into his room as she did.Even if they had known that Kanata was Haishin, they would never have done such a thing\u2026 He wondered if he expected too much\u2026 or trusted too much, but at least he knew that Maria and Alphana were very important friends.(\u2026 Maybe I trust them too much? Jeez, I don\u2019t know anymore.)Kanata began contemplating the possibility of turning back time if he could, but Alphana interjected in response to his earlier question,\u201cThe reason we noticed it is\u2026 well, it can be said to be the result of connecting small clues. When Kanata-sama and I met, Kanata-sama had an injury on her hand, right?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yeah.\u201dThen Kanata remembered.The thing had fallen on his hand, and he had put some sort of poultice to reduce the swelling. Apparently, that\u2019s what Alphana had noticed.The only person he had a conversation with at the time was Alphana, so he was caught completely off guard, and the result was him thinking he wouldn\u2019t get found out, which was a magnificent act of naivete.\u201cI got somewhat caught up in the intonation of how you speak, you know? When that demon said something significant to you, and when you saved that lady\u2026 your words were completely Haishin-sama\u2019s, Kanata-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIn other words, Kanata was providing the girls with hints, albeit unconsciously.Well, he doubted if they were fully sure they had noticed, but from the way the girls didn\u2019t seem too surprised, he guessed they really did find out.\u201cBut how could you not tell me? You kept quiet all this time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s obvious.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s given.\u201dThe reply was quick.They walked over to Kanata, and first, Alphana gently shook Kanata\u2019s hand.\u201cEven if we know the truth, we are fans of Haishin-sama\u2019s\u2026 Kanata-sama. We would never do anything to embarrass you because from that moment on, we don\u2019t think we are qualified to call ourselves fans.\u201d\u201cAlphana\u2026\u201dMaria also took Kanata\u2019s free hand.\u201cYeah. Alphana is right. We want Kanata-kun, or to say Haishin-sama, to freely deliver your voice, and we look forward to hearing you speak, in your usual way, without fear.\u201d\u201cMaria\u2026\u201dKanata thanked them both from the bottom of his heart.In his previous life, he had seen cases where the leakage of a streamer\u2019s secret had led to the spread of strange stories or weird rumours.There were many possibilities, such as face reveal, address disclosure, etc., but these girls did not leak any secrets to the outside\u2026 It may be naive at that point, but Kanata trusted them quite a bit.\u201cKanata-sama, we are on your side.\u201d\u201cYes, Kanata-kun. You have a princess and a saint on your side\u2026 which I think is pretty reassuring, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yeah. That\u2019s true.\u201dKanata nodded.However\u2026 There was one thing that bothered him.(\u2026 What is it?)There was something faintly scary about the atmosphere enveloping the two of them.The two people looking at Kanata had very kind eyes, but he couldn\u2019t help but think that their eyes were slightly clouded, if anything.However, it was natural to feel embarrassed when two beautiful girls were staring at you while holding your hand at close range like this.\u201cOh, by the way\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\u2026 and the two of them closed the distance even more.Kanata took a step back this time, as it seemed they were competing.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201cSorry, Kanata-kun.\u201dThe two of them noticed and quickly pulled their hands away from him.Kanata apologized in his heart for being rude to them, thinking that the disturbing feeling he had felt earlier must have been his imagination since these girls were so considerate.\u201cNo, I was just wondering why no one has come here since a while ago.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because I used eviction magic.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes, I did. From how Kanata-sama was acting, I thought it was something that must not be heard from outside, but it seems to have worked.\u201dKanata was also considerate of his surroundings, but apparently, it was thanks to Alphana\u2019s magic that kept people from coming to this place.He said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and she giggled while replying, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\u201cNow then,\u201d Kanata continued as he finally arrived at the main topic.\u201cYou know, there is a reason I\u2019m telling you both this is out of the blue. There are a lot of rumours going around about Haishin right now.\u201d\u201cI know. It\u2019s unpleasant.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201dOya, the two of them are emitting a chilling aura again.Maria mentioned something while wearing such an aura. In a way, it shattered Kanata\u2019s determination to rely on them in this way.\u201cMy father and mother are leading the charge to retract these rumours. We\u2019ve already found out from a confidential source which country they\u2019re working with and for what purpose.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cIn the first place, they say that Haishin-sama is a mass murderer, but we have no information that anyone has died anywhere in large numbers like that. Moreover, we know that what Haishin-sama is doing is using magic power that is impossible for ordinary people.\u201d\u201c\u2026 you mean?\u201dMaria said this boldly as she held up her fingers and puffed out her chest.\u201cFather, Mother, and other heads of state have come to one conclusion. Either Haishin-sama holds a nearly infinite amount of magical power we do not understand, or he uses some unknown magical device that we do not know about.\u201dSo, to sum up what Maria was trying to say, it was this.Countries were unaware of who Haishin was and didn\u2019t understand how he conducted his streaming activities\u2026 but they only seemed to judge that Haishin had some kind of power and that it solved the problem of magic power depletion.\u201cSo this is how the problem will get resolved without Kanata-sama needing to rely on us. Haishin-sama\u2019s name has great significance in this world, and he has great support from the people. This is why many people, including Maria\u2019s parents, cannot tolerate any attempt to embarrass you.\u201dKanata felt a sense of relief when he heard Alphana\u2019s words.However, Kanata thought it was just an act of making others clean up the mess he brought, and he was not satisfied with it.That\u2019s why Kanata also didn\u2019t change to do what he could.\u201cI still have a lot to prove with my own hands. I need to ask you two to help me with that\u2014I trust you both\u2026 you know.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dKanata said so, looking embarrassed.He didn\u2019t know what the two were thinking, but they were making a face that girls shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do while taking advantage of the fact that Kanata wasn\u2019t looking.They had unlikely looks, unbecoming of a princess and a saint.\u201cSo what can I do for you\u2026 un?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dThe two quickly returned their faces back to normal.True to princesses and saints, the bashful look disappears in an instant.\u201cYou know the orb for measuring magic power used at the time of entrance into the school?\u201d\u201cYes, I know. It\u2019s an important magic item, so it\u2019s stored in a safe place.\u201dAn item able to measure magic power is a pretty important one.That is why it was kept at the back of the institute under strict security even though it had no other use.\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s right! And I was thinking if you could let me borrow that\u2014\u201d\u201cVery well. As a princess, I give you permission.\u201d\u201cYes. As a saint, I\u2019ll give you permission to do so, and of course, I\u2019ll take full responsibility for whatever condition you end up in.\u201dThere is nothing to worry about as, apparently, it will be easy to borrow it.So this is how Kanata revealed his true identity to the two of them\u2026 but their inner feelings were so wild that ten typhoons were generated in one place.[I\u2019m afraid of what these women were thinking, so I\u2019d better stop just imagining.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: There was \u201conce\u201d a HaishinshaAfter enlisting the help of Maria and Alphana, Kanata immediately sprang into action.The only thing to do was to make the camera detachable so that it could be moved around by hand for remote streaming.But as far as this one goes, it was fine.\u201cHey, hey\u2026 are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m nervous\u2026\u201dMaria and Alphana were restless behind Kanata as he prepared.It is now dark after the sunset, and the place where Kanata and the girls are is a room specially prepared for them.\u201cHey, hey. I don\u2019t mind if you quit after coming here\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m o-okay!\u201d\u201cY-yes!\u201dWhile smiling at the two, who seemed to be going crazy, Kanata thought back to how this happened.The purpose this time was to erase the rumours circulating about Haishin, but Kanata also wanted to see what he could do to help.(\u2026 But maybe that\u2019s just shallow thinking.)As a matter of fact, he now began to think that what he was about to do was too rash.What Kanata set out to do was simple: to prove by pouring magic into the orb now at hand with the help of Maria and Alphana.On second thought, if they say that the orb was tampered with, that would be a complaint, and if you were one of Haishin\u2019s detractors, they were certain to want to take advantage of it.\u201c\u2026 Well, let nature take its course.\u201dSo Maria and Alphana also decided to help him in an even more unexpected way.And he couldn\u2019t imagine not doing anything after having gone this far. In order to spend his days as Haishin happily and to provide the same quality of time to his listeners, he had to overcome this issue.(\u2026?)Only Kanata, Maria, and Alphana were supposed to be in this room, but it felt like the air was shaking.When he turned his eyes, only the hand appeared, and a thumbs up were given as if to tell him to do his best.\u201c\u2026 Fuu.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Suu.\u201dThe hand\u2019s owner was Mira, who seemed to be watching over them in a place they couldn\u2019t see.Even though she was merely watching, it is undeniably the fact that she was the ultimate type of stalker\u2026 though we should leave that part aside for now.\u201cIt\u2019s about time. Both of you, let\u2019s get started, shall we?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dThe two got into it with a huff, and Kanata handed the camera to Alphana.Alphana took the camera nervously, trying not to scratch it, and pointed the lens at Kanata with all the caution she could muster.Kanata\u2019s reflection in the lens was black-clad and wearing a mask.It was a measure to ensure that his face would never get seen, and what he was doing this time was the first attempt in this world of streaming.\u201cKanata-kun.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dAnd so began what would later become the legend of Haishin\u2026On that day, the broadcast viewers saw something different from the usual.The ability to stream from the camera meant that Haishin\u2019s hand was visible in the video, but this time it was a person wearing a dubious mask.[Hi, listeners, have you been waiting for me?]With a light tone and voice, it was definitely Haishin\u2019s.Although his exaggerated gestures were a little awkward, the presence in his black robe was definitely Haishin.[This is the first time I showed myself like this in front of everyone. Well, I can\u2019t show you my face to have some privacy.]It was an unusual delivery that was more obvious than fire.The followers who genuinely like Haishin, and even the haters, were drawn to his unusual appearance.Although it was impossible to tell where he was now against a completely blank background, it was possible to see his followers, who were not satisfied with just his voice and his hands, going crazy somewhere.[There\u2019s a reason for this unusual style. Recently, there is a rumour going around that I\u2019m causing a lot of casualties in some countries to do streaming. I know it sounds like a selfish thing to say, but the fact was that I couldn\u2019t prove it with words alone. Well, it seems that all the listeners believe me.]Many of his followers nodded their heads in agreement.In the first place, it is thought that Haishin is an extraordinary being just for having created the culture of streaming in this way.And the rumours that Haishin mentioned were indeed whispered, but then the more obvious they were, the more noise they would make.[It\u2019s a rumour without basis, but it\u2019s not impossible that someone who doesn\u2019t know the truth about me would come to that conclusion\u2026 No, that is a huge pain! Hey, you hear me, you naysayers? You\u2019re the reason I haven\u2019t been able to sleep at night. You\u2019re the reason I\u2019m troubled.]\u2018Hm? That\u2019s not really normal,\u2019 the listeners chuckled.But now that he had spoken the truth about himself, the listeners stared at the screen, wondering if that meant that they would be able to get to the bottom of Haishin\u2019s little-known secret.[Well, I\u2019d like to explain to you how I\u2019ve been able to continue to broadcast. And that\u2019s why my collaborators have come a long way to help me.]Collaborators. There were many who were surprised by the word.Until now, Haishin has never shown anyone\u2019s presence and has been working alone to stream his content.So it was natural for them to be curious to know that there was someone who was able to meet him.[Come. Oh, and give me the camera.]The change from an acting-like tone, as if he were addressing a friend, was overshadowed by a rustling sound.The next moment, two people appeared on the screen to their surprise.[Nice to meet you all.][Good evening.]They were the Kingdom\u2019s princess, Maria, and the Saint, Alphana.Maria\u2019s face is well-known in other countries, but Alphana is also well-known in many countries and regions as a saint since she made her public appearance.Imposter, or so it seemed, they thought, although they were too much of the same.[I\u2019ve decided to show up this time because I want to cooperate with Haishin-sama.][It may look complicated, but I want to tell you that we, the princess and saint, are his listeners too. We are fans just like you.]It\u2019s true that it would be considered complicated, but on the contrary, there were a lot of comments saying that it was great that Haishin had fans like the two of them, and although there were a few, there were also a lot of comments saying that it was not fair that they get to meet Haishin.[I was happy that they could help me in this way. I didn\u2019t expect these two bigwigs to be listeners, but when I heard that, I didn\u2019t get excited, but the opposite.][Fufu, I can still remember how surprised Haishin-sama was.][That\u2019s right! It was kind of\u2026 refreshing.]The sight of Haishin, who seemed suspicious but is now a charismatic figure among young people, and the princess and the saint talking happily with him was too new to them.It was a scene that seemed to make listeners forget the passage of time, and they felt as if they had seen the further potential of Haishin.[Well, let\u2019s get down to business.]The air changed as Haishin said that.The round orb in the saint\u2019s hand was an item only some knew.[This orb is a magic item that measures how much magic power a person possesses by touching it. This time, I managed to borrow it thanks to the cooperation of these two people.]Maria held out her hand to test the orb for measuring magic power, and it glowed gold.Basically, the amount of magic power possessed is rated by how it glows, and a golden glow is a sign that it is equivalent to the SSS rank.[My capacity SSS rank, so it glows like this.]Of course, there is also the strength of the light, but basically, the greater the magic power rank, the more golden and noble the shine may be.Now that it came to this, they were curious about Haishin\u2019s intentions for borrowing this.[First of all, I would like to mention\u2026 Well, to put it simply, my magic power is limitless.]Many listeners were a bit taken aback.However, there were also many who were convinced it was true and many who blindly worshiped Haishin.It was an unfounded belief that there was no such thing as unlimited magic power, but it was possible because of Haishin.\u201cHaishin-sama, here.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThe camera was given to Maria, showing Alphana with Haishin and the orb.The listeners\u2019 expectant gazes were fixed on the screen, wondering what kind of brilliance Haishin and his unlimited magic power would show them.[Let\u2019s go.]Haishin held out his hand to the orb.It turned golden, then black and eerie\u2026 then back to golden, then to black again.It was as if the endless flow of magic power inside the orb was repulsive.Naturally, there is no precedent for such a thing, and those who know of the orb\u2019s existence have no choice but to stare at it as if they were devouring it.[It isn\u2019t going to crack or something\u2026 right?][Probably not\u2026 But I\u2019ve never seen a result like this before.][Wait!?]And when tens of seconds had passed with the magic power, a change occurred.The colours, which had alternated between gold and black, began to glow with rainbow colours\u2026 and the light leaked out as if it was going to burst.The three of them were standing right there when the light subsided, as Maria\u2019s voice sounded impatient and the listeners were worried.The orb was well intact, not cracked or anything, and Haishin, Maria, and Alphana were all tilting their heads, wondering what had happened.[\u2026 What?][Outside?][Huh?]That\u2019s when Haishin and his team noticed the buzz in the comments section.The rest of the listeners looked out as well, watching on the screen how the three put the camera in its place and gone to check outside had gone speechless and quiet.Then, something like a rainbow-coloured sea appeared in the sky, which was originally jet black with stars.It was a phenomenon that does not exist in this world\u2026 Yes, it was the aurora borealis.The exact same colour as the radiance shown by Haishin now dyed the sky of the world of Ataraxia.[\u2026 Perhaps the endless magic power of Haishin-sama that leaked from the orb caused this beautiful miracle?]Such were all Alphana\u2019s words.It wasn\u2019t just one person or just one country.The aurora could be seen from all countries and regions. It proved the absolute nature of Haishin\u2019s magic power.That once-in-a-lifetime-only miracle became a legend that got passed down for generations.~Haishin possesses infinite magic power and can be the light that illuminates all worlds.\u201c\u2026 This has gone over the top.\u201dNaturally, Kanata held his head.And the number of believers grew.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: Haishin ain\u2019t stopping!\u201cHey, hey! Do you think Haishin is going to appear again today?\u201d\u201cHe will! And I\u2019m really looking forward to it!\u201d\u201cAre you also going to watch him today?\u201d\u201cOf course, I will!\u201dThe world was truly in the age of Haishin!Even within the Royal Academy, the influence of Haishin was tremendous.On that day, Haishin revealed that he possessed unlimited magical power, and it caused a beautiful aurora in the night sky, later known as God\u2019s Miracle, that became etched in many\u2019s memories.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhile the academy got enveloped in the Haishin boom, Kanata was thinking about what a terrible thing it had become.Although Kanata was not against the idea of becoming popular\u2014he felt it was an honour\u2014, the fact that such a phenomenon occurred was unexpected, and the aforementioned \u2018God\u2019s Miracle\u2019 also caused Kanata to feel a strange sense of pressure.(What a God\u2019s Miracle, you idiot! That was just a coincidence! And I shouldn\u2019t have mentioned the aurora!)That\u2019s right, Kanata uttered the name of that thing floating in the sky.[It\u2019s like the Aurora Borealis. Ain\u2019t that beautiful?]Just to reiterate, there was no such phenomenon as the Aurora Borealis here in Ataraxia.So while people wondered what this was all about, Haishin\u2019s words, they were words that had a clear answer to this phenomenon.In other words, this aurora outbreak was deemed intentional by Haishin.\u201c\u2026 Haah. Well, whatever will be, will be, right?\u201dIt\u2019s not that Kanata\u2019s secret is known. It was just that his secret as Haishin is known to the world.So, as before, Kanata intended to continue broadcasting his work while keeping his appearance as Haishin a secret without any particular concern.\u201cAlphana-sama! What kind of person was Haishin-sama!?\u201d\u201cWhat did you talk about!\u201d\u201cI\u2019d love to hear about it!\u201dAnd in an even more straightforward form, people swarmed Alphana with questions of Haishin.Apparently, the same is true for Maria, who belongs to the SSS class, and the two appeared on the streaming with countless questions and envious glances.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t in the original plan for them to appear. However, Maria and Alphana, who have an unparalleled name value in the Kingdom, suggested that they might be able to prove a point by appearing in the video, which they did.Naturally, there was some concern that this would cause a problem because they would have to show their faces, but they told him not to worry about it.\u201cKanata-kun, I want you to continue to stream with comfort, so please let me\u2026 okay?\u201d\u201cIf Kanata-sama is willing to do this much for his people, I can at least do this much\u2026 right?\u201dHe was a little scared there, but\u2026 eventually, he agreed.They both said it was payback for the many quality times they had as followers of Haishin, but it was actually Kanata who owed them a big favour for this.\u201c\u2026 Well, I\u2019ll at least think of something in return.\u201dThe class was over, and it was time to return to the dorms.\u201cWhat the heck is this Haishin nonsense?\u2019\u201c\u2026 But nobody has expected him to show up like that\u2026\u201d\u201cAan? You\u2019re on Haishin\u2019s side!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that!\u201dNaturally, as he was received favourably, he was also being resented.Basically, the commoners are very accepting of Haishin, but some nobles hate him, and you may see scenes like this.However, due to how well accepted Haishin was, not only at the school but in many other places, they were considered something like heretics.(People have their preferences, you know. I\u2019m not going to deny that.)Rather, Kanata told his followers there was nothing wrong if someone didn\u2019t like Haishin and that they shouldn\u2019t overreact.(And the way things get done at Senshi\u2026 It\u2019s just\u2026)He found out later that the nobles of the small nation Senshi spread falsehoods against Haishin and got kicked out of the country\u2026 Apparently, they were hurt pretty badly, though not as bad as they should have been.It wasn\u2019t only that. There was also a rumour that they were also found guilty of gathering slaves and siphoning off their magic power in an attempt to imitate Haishin.(No one can copy me or follow me on their own\u2026 Still, at least I\u2019m the one who triggered it. I just hope the slaves have good aftercare.)There will be no need to worry about the slaves, as this got mentioned in his stream.Maria and Alphana also told him that if it is too much for the Senshi alone, the Kingdom will lend a helping hand.\u201cKanata-sama.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Alphana.\u201dMaybe he was in a daze, as he didn\u2019t even notice Alphana was beside him.Because she is a saint and an equal-minded person, people still look at her, especially the nobility, in a way they don\u2019t like. However, they don\u2019t say anything because Alphana sincerely hates such discrimination.\u201cIs something troubling you?\u201d\u201cNo, not really.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dShe closed the distance between them and looked into his face.The sweet flowery scent tickled his nostrils, and her immense beauty made him pull back his body.\u201cIs there anything I can do for you?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201dMaria is no different, but Alphana started to speak to him extremely often after he told her he was Haishin.Kanata was happy that the girls were generous enough to say they were his fans and wanted to be friends with him, but something hidden behind their eyes sometimes frightened him.\u201cFufu, you see Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dShe quickly moved her lips to Kanata\u2019s ear.\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to your streaming today!\u201d\u201cO-ou\u2026\u201dHe always wanted to be famous, not without a desire to be flattered.So it was impossible not to be happy when a beautiful girl familiar with the situation told him that she was looking forward to the event.(\u2026 Alphana and Maria both are really good people.)Kanata nodded again at how wonderful these girls were, reflecting that this was truly a wonderful world to be in.\u201c\u2026 Fufu.\u201dWell, it would be nice to be able to notice their deepest thoughts, but Kanata didn\u2019t yet have the observational skills to detect that much.\u201cWell, I\u2019d better be on my way.\u201d\u201cYes. See you tomorrow \u266a.\u201dMaria was not at the academy today because of her formal duties as a princess. But like Alphana, she offered kind words whenever she saw him, so Kanata was truly grateful to have them as friends.After parting with Alphana, he immediately returned to the dorm and found that his room was the same as usual.Kanata muttered quietly, though he didn\u2019t think it was possible.\u201c\u2026 Mira.\u201d\u201cCan I help you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHis vision wavered, and Mira appeared before him as if to show she had been there from the beginning.Although her smile was cute and lovely, perhaps because she was happy to be called by Kanata, from Kanata\u2019s point of view, there was nothing else to do but to hold his head up.\u201c\u2026 You know what? Why don\u2019t you just go back to your empire? Are you going to be a real stalker?\u201d\u201cI have no intention of doing so\u2026 I just want to protect you, Kanata-sama.\u201dIt is true that Kanata was more than reassured to be protected by such a skilled person like Mira, but it made him feel uncomfortable to be around her all the time.And the fact that she said everything she does is for him and that she will never cause him any trouble is also completely stalker-like.\u201cWhat about your work as Raven? Are you fine leaving it?\u201d\u201cYes. I plan to retire from my job as Raven. I am sure my father in heaven will celebrate my leaving.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is that so?\u201dHis stomach churned as he wondered if they would say that Raven\u2019s disappearance resulted from Haishin\u2019s influence.Well, the controversy would descend upon Haishin had been temporarily resolved.However, there may still be many anti-Haisin in the world.Although they may have been stopped during their ambitions\u2026 there may be others sharpening their blades to reach him one day.\u201cWell, even if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll just go on my merry way!\u201dStreaming cheerfully and providing followers with a good time is what being a Haishinsha is all about.Kanata was even more fired up and vowed to become even more popular.He was able to go from just podcasting his voice to hands-only streaming, and this time, he managed to go beyond that boundary to a method of filming and broadcasting.[TLN: Kinda like Vlogging.]Kanata couldn\u2019t hide his excitement, thinking that there were many more things he could do from now on.~~~~~~~~~~~~Reincarnation; there is always a meaning to it.The being that guided Kanata and blessed Kanata\u2019s future laughed happily.\u201dFufu, you really seem to be enjoying yourself. I didn\u2019t expect you to handle the unlimited magic power I gave you like that. It\u2019s funny\u2026 Very funny, human child.\u201dShe was a divine being, an object of absolute devotion not to be seen in public.Although her face is hidden behind a white veil, her high-pitched, clear voice is unmistakably that of a woman.Even if it was impossible to see the full features, her beauty was something that can\u2019t be described in a single word.She was a true deity, or perhaps you could say a goddess.\u201cOh, it\u2019s really funny\u2026 this thing called streaming.\u201dEven though she was a divine being, her sense of fashion was already done for.She was wearing a shirt that wrapped her intensely uneven body, and on that shirt was printed a figure in black and a mask. Yes, it was Haishin from the day he performed the miracle!There were even strange words painted on the back, saying, \u201cI am Haishin.'\u201dI dare not assert who she is, but Haisin\u2019s wicked influence has even reached this point.I\u2019m not sure if this world is safe anymore\u2026 I\u2019m not just a little bit worried, but a lot more worried.[Postscript]So that\u2019s the end of volume one!I couldn\u2019t have done it without you, my readers, so thank you so much!I\u2019m not used to gory otherworldly stuff, so this one had the element of streaming in it!See you next time!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: Ah, the wild T-shirt showed upFor some time after Haishin caused the phenomenon known as the Aurora Borealis, the world was experiencing an even greater wave of Haishin boom.It mainly spread among young people, of course, but it has recently become widespread among the elderly.\u201cI wonder if I will hear Haishin-kun\u2019s voice again today.\u201d\u201cWho knows? But I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201dIt was not unusual for old ladies in the neighbourhood to get together and have such conversations, gossiping about a young idol.Of course, not only old ladies but also old men that came to know through the youngsters how they felt about the system of slavery that Haishin had created. Some could be seen talking about what a wonderful young man Haishin was.\u201c\u2026\u201dMeanwhile, a man dressed in a suspicious-looking costume was walking through the royal capital.\u201c\u2026 long way to go, huh.\u201dHe was a young man who had left his hometown for a reason.He stopped at a nearby restaurant, ordered a quick meal and waited for it.\u201cHow strange. It should have been so painful, but somehow I feel refreshed.\u201dHe muttered to himself.He had a girl who had once pledged her future to him.The two were not aristocrats, but commoners, so it was just a youthful promise, but even so, the people in the village recognized how well they got along, and even he was strangely certain they would be together in the future.\u201cWell, I guess that means these things happen.\u201dBut he never got together with the girl.Unlike him, who had a weak body, she wanted to become an adventurer, and when a group of adventurers visited her village, they took her on a journey.\u201cI\u2019ll come back stronger for sure!\u201dShe saw him off with a smile, and he waited for her return.Six months or so later, she came back\u2026 but to his surprise, she was already in a relationship with the leader of that adventuring party.\u201cI\u2019ve decided to be with him. I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t be with a weakling like you anymore.\u201d\u201cSo give it up, you t**d. I\u2019ll make this girl happy.\u201dIt was not only the two of them, but the rest of the group laughed down at him.It was frustrating but understandable to be attracted to a leader who was a stronger and better man than he was, but naturally\u2026 sadness still followed.The taunting and cursing may have triggered it, but it awakened the power that lay dormant within him.\u201cW-what is this\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat the h**l are you doing?\u201dIt was a raging, violent, magical power.It gave him a lot of confidence.He thought he could use this power to look down\u2026 at those who made fun of him, no. He thought he could do more than that, but he didn\u2019t.Because the whole time she was gone, he was listening to the words of a certain being.\u201cHey, guys! It\u2019s that time of the day again!\u201d\u2026 Ohh, there he is again!Yes, his emotional support was Haishin, the charismatic streamer.[Haa\u2026 She dumped you? I see\u2026 it must\u2019ve been so hard.]\u201cMust\u2019ve been so hard.\u201d His words were very kind\u2026[It is said that there are as many break-ups as encounters. You don\u2019t need to feel down just because you got dumped once. And if you get another girlfriend and she breaks up with you, you can come to me like this and complain about it. Not only me but everyone else will be there to comfort you. Right, everyone?]Many comments were filled with comfort in response to the letter, endorsing his opinion.Of course, it was the same for him. He sent word that he\u2019d do his best with the other comments.[Love is difficult, is it not? But don\u2019t get depressed just because you got rejected. It\u2019s true that it\u2019s hard, and you might want to cry, but you should push yourself to be a good man. Become a big man and laugh at them for dumping you. It\u2019s more beneficial to live a relaxed life like that.]His words at that time prompted him to make a clean break-up with her.He, however, felt like punching the group\u2019s leader. But he turned his back on him, saying it wasn\u2019t worth it hitting a guy like him.\u201c\u2026 Haishin, you really are a wonder. It\u2019s not normal to be able to save someone so much with just one word. You\u2019re an amazing person.\u201dPerhaps there could have been a future in which he wielded his power as he felt like it, and if it weren\u2019t for the awakening of his magical power, there would have been a future where he would have gotten beaten to a rag.But he decided not to and to keep his eyes firmly ahead.And now he stands in front of a brothel that is said to be the finest in the kingdom.[If you\u2019re going through a hard time and need some relief, try a brothel. People look at prostitutes differently these days, and people working there take pride in their work. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have a great time there.]It\u2019s true that he had broken up, but he needed healing.So he came here to be taken care of by Veneti, a brothel in King\u2019s Landing.\u201c\u2026 Alright, I should go!\u201dA future that possibly existed.He\u2019s the type of guy who awakened his powers because his precious childhood friend got stolen from him without his knowledge. Today he had become a successful regular customer thanks to the beautiful and kind women of the brothel.Now, Kanata, the one who was responsible for bringing that man into the swamp like that, sneezed.\u201cAchoo!\u201dMaria and Alphana, standing beside him, looked at him worriedly but then laughed. Someone must be gossiping about Haishin since he didn\u2019t seem to have a cold.\u201cWell, that\u2019s certainly possible.\u201d\u201cFufu. He\u2019s going to be sneezing for the rest of his life.\u201dKanata shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t want that.\u201dThe three of them were now in a room in the royal city\u2019s church as Alphana\u2019s guests.Kanata, aside from Maria, drew gazes from the sisters as to who he was, but they seemed convinced when Alphana explained that he was a dear friend.\u201cBut still, a supporter, huh?\u201d\u201cYes. What do you think?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s a pretty good idea.\u201dKanata came here because of a certain proposal.The proposal was that Maria and Alphana should take the lead and become supporters of Haishin, Kanata\u2019s role.Kanata wondered if it was roughly like that in his previous life, though each streamer was able to become such an existence.\u201cAlthough Kanata-sama did not show his true face, many people have seen you in that black robe and mask at that time. With just his voice and hands, he was an idol, but by actually showing his true form, he proved to the people that the existence of Haishin was indeed real.\u201d\u201cThat is one of the reasons why famous painters in the kingdom want to preserve the image of Kanata-kun as a portrait. I think we could also maybe do that or make some other goods for Haishin-sama.\u201dIn other words, along with the idea of spreading the word about Haishin in a more visible way, they both want him to help them with that.As for Kanata, he had thought that making goods would be a little further down the road, but he did not expect he would get a proposal to do what he had been thinking earlier in this way. And while Kanata was surprised, he could not stop being excited to talk about something like that as a streamer.\u201cGoods, huh\u2026 I\u2019ve been thinking about that, but I wonder if it\u2019s okay? For a princess and the saint to support me.\u201d\u201cOf course, I won\u2019t make it public, but I thought it would be better if only Kanata-sama knew.\u201d\u201cYeah. Now that we\u2019ve gotten to know each other, we\u2019d like to help out.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Both of you.\u201dKanata was about to cry at how gentle and full of compassion they were.Thinking about it, he became famous as Haishin after coming to the other world. But he hadn\u2019t met anyone who would be so accommodating and consider Kanata as a Haishin.(\u2026 Oh no, I\u2019ll lose my heart at this rate. No, I shouldn\u2019t. I should be thankful to them.)Kanata himself was only an ordinary person, so he could only fantasize.However, Kanata here can be said to have made a fine play\u2026 because if he had accidentally said that he was in love with them, it would have made his feelings as Kanata even stronger and perhaps it would have been something he could not come back from.\u201cBy the way, why did you suddenly start talking about goods and stuff?\u201d\u201cAh, the thing is\u2026\u201dIt was a genuine question.To answer Kanata\u2019s question, Alphana took out something\u2026 It was a shirt, a black robe and a mask with Haishin printed on it.\u201cW-what is this?\u201dApparently, it wasn\u2019t Maria or Alphana who made this.When he asked for more details, they told him the shirt was on the statue of the Goddess honoured in the church this morning.\u201c\u2026 Is something wrong with the church?\u201d\u201cFufu, well, there are many Kanata-sama fans here too.\u201dHowever, they really didn\u2019t know why this shirt was there.They don\u2019t know who in the world could have done such a prank, but Alpana mentioned perhaps it could be a divine mandate from the Goddess.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201dYare-yare, the world is such a cruel place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: What is a support group?\u201cI see. This is where they sell most of their goods.\u201d\u201cYeah. And here\u2026 hmm?\u201dThat day, Kanata shuddered.While showing Mira, who walked next to him, around more detailed parts of the city, he was surprised to find that he no longer felt uncomfortable with her presence.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIs something wrong?\u201dWith Kanata staring at her, Mira tilted her head to see if something was wrong.While the gesture was very cute, combined with her appearance, Kanata stopped to rethink how Mira had already blended into his daily life.\u201c\u2026 Okay, let\u2019s move on to the next!\u201dKanata switched to not overthinking things and started to walk away, but Mira froze on the spot, seemingly moved by something.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cUh, um\u2026 um!\u201dKanata was alarmed to see her body shaking and her eyes moistening.When he asked her a reason as to what was wrong, her reply was too trivial to be true.\u201cJust now\u2026 It was like real Haishin-sama \u266a.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201dIt seemed that she was just impressed.Let\u2019s move on to the next~It was not something he was particularly conscious of, but it was a phrase he mainly used to signal the next part of the letter\u2026 Kanata let out a sigh, not expecting that just this one phrase would be so marginalized.(\u2026 Every time I used to see a popular streamer in my past life, I envied them for being so chirpy, wondering what it was all about. Maybe it was because my mind was tired from seeing them.)However, the fact that she tried to kill herself with just one word from Kanata makes him think he is carrying a bombshell of a baggage on his shoulders. But on the bright side, he can\u2019t neglect her because she has helped him to gather information by sneaking into the country of Senshi.It seems that there has not been much disruption in the Empire when she stopped working as Raven, but it is still better than having her hands in the blood.\u201cBut for now, Mira.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYou should go live somewhere else.\u201dIt was disturbing to have someone stay in your room forever.Despite her childlike face, her body is well-developed and s**y, and she also possesses a certain beauty that makes you think she is out of this world.But even if she is like that, he doesn\u2019t want her to stay in his room like that.It\u2019s only been a few days or so, but he wanted to make sure she has a place to stay as soon as possible.\u201cN-no way!?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re surprised like that.\u201dKanata sighed at Mira, who looked as if she got stuck by lightning.It was nice to know that she likes Haishin that much, but it is important to draw the line where there should be one.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re a fan of mine, and I like how you didn\u2019t tell anyone who I am because you found me. And more to the point, I really appreciate that you used your abilities as Raven to help me out that time.\u201d\u201cEhe\u2026 ehehe, you think so \u266a.\u201d\u201cBut stalking is wrong, you see?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201dKanata endured her reaction, which was like that of an abandoned puppy.For the time being, Kanata managed to get Mira to promise to take up residence here in the royal capital, meaning that Kanata would be able to return to his peaceful life alone.However, it was clear that she had no intention of returning to the Empire at all. Furthermore, she was not even thinking of going anywhere other than the capital.\u201cI want to stay by Kanata-sama\u2019s side as much as possible.\u201dThat\u2019s what she said with a smile.It should have made Kanata very happy but seeing such an adorable smile inevitably reminded him of the time when she stuck to the ceiling in a crouching position.In conclusion, Kanata would never forget the weight of the spit at that moment.\u201cWell, that\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s move on to the next one~\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yay \u266a.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t react to every single word I say!\u201dAnd so they were back on the tour.However, since they had already seen some large residences and places selling daily items, they just needed to finish their lunch and head home.\u201cIt\u2019s here\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026? Ohh.\u201dMira turned her attention to a fancy building\u2026 to the brothel Veneti.The building was so magnificent that you wouldn\u2019t think it was a brothel at a quick glance, but it was a famous place where Kanna, whom Kanata helped before, was also working.\u201cThere are a lot of men who use it even though it is midday.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Right.\u201dThe scene of a small beautiful girl observing the men coming in and out of the brothel was quite surreal.\u201cIt\u2019s not strange that they are open day and night. Regardless of the time of day, adventurers returning from the dungeon may be looking for a place to relax.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 heh.\u201d\u201cAnd stop staring,\u201d saying that, I poked her lightly in the shoulder.However, looking at the building as Kanata did, she noticed naturally what kind of customers were there.Looking at a man who came out with a woman with a risqu\u00e9 appearance, Mira murmured,\u201cHe is strong\u2026 but too lax.\u201dThe man Mira described as strong was quite delirious with the woman.As she kissed him on the cheek as a parting gift, his face turned red like a boiled octopus, and he turned away while waving his hand.\u201cAre you interested?\u201d\u201cWell, some people are just like that\u2026 An?\u201dHe spontaneously spoke back but turned around to see who it was.Kanata thought the voice sounded familiar, and there was a face he recognized.\u201cKanna-san?\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s been a long time, Kanata-kun.\u201dShe was Kanna, a high-class courtesan working at the brothel Veneti.Her beauty was the same as always, and the s*x appeal emanating from her was enough to make you feel dizzy. However, Kanata stood his ground, tightening his expression.\u201c\u2026 you are?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanna turned to Mira.After exchanging silent glances with each other with Kanata in between, they nodded and shook hands with each other.\u201cHi, I\u2019m Kanna.\u201d\u201cMira. No wonder\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. I guess so.\u201dNeedless to say, Kanata wondered what on earth they were talking about.After that, Kanata and Mira were taken into the brothel and arrived in the most magnificent room.\u201c\u2026 Awesome.\u201d\u201cHow much is it costing you?\u201dApparently, this was Kanna\u2019s private room, and it was so gleaming.The three of them were sitting around one table, and in front of them was a lineup of dishes that you wouldn\u2019t see even in the finest restaurants.\u201cPlease. I was just about to leave for lunch, and it was perfect timing.\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cYou sure?\u201dKanata and Mira took advantage of Kanna\u2019s generosity, saying they would not hesitate as she had requested and that he was a growing child.Kanata also has the money he earned from streaming, so it wasn\u2019t like he could afford such a luxury. However, since he basically lived the same life as a commoner, this fine cuisine was new to him.\u201cActually, I was in the presence of the saintly Lady Alphana just now. And Princess Maria was also there.\u201d\u201cHeh?\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dApparently, Kanna had a meeting with both Maria and Alphana in the morning.Kanata thought that, as a high-class courtesan, she probably had some connection with the princess and saint.\u2026 However, Kanata choked on his food because of what he heard.\u201cI\u2019ve been accepted into the group that supports Haishin-sama. I\u2019m member number three.\u201d\u201cWhat the\u2026 goho\u2026 goho!\u201d[EDN: Coughing.]Kanata\u2019s sudden reaction to Haishin\u2019s name and its content was easy to understand.Mira immediately handed him a glass of water, so it was not serious, but it was natural for him to want to ask what the meeting was about.\u201cW-what about the meeting, you say\u2026?\u201dHe knew Maria and Alphana would be his supporters, but he had not heard they would create such a fan club of sorts.Or rather, in the first place, it was also the first time he heard that Kanna was listening to his streams.\u201cKanna-san, do you know about Haishin too?\u201d\u201cYes. He\u2019s more important to me than anyone else. He\u2019s precious to me in every way.\u201dKanna mouthed that while looking at Kanata.Unlike Maria, Alphana and Mira, Kanna was not supposed to know the truth about Kanata\u2026 which made him a little itchy.\u201c\u2026 Together with Princess Maria and Saint Alphana\u2026 I see, I see.\u201dMira mumbled something, but Kanata didn\u2019t hear much.After finishing the food, Mira went to the restroom for a bit, and Kanna opened her mouth as she shifted the front of her dress as if to take advantage of Mira\u2019s absence.\u201cKanata-kun, since you\u2019re here, would you like me to give you a service\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I-it\u2019s too early to tell!\u201d\u201cOh, so it\u2019s good when the time is right?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah\u2026 that\u2026 about that\u2026\u201dKanata started to panic when he was put in such an atmosphere, even though he had the age of a curious teenager.As for Kanna, she was just making fun of him. She laughed, apologized and returned to where she had been.Thus ended the incident at the brothel, but Kanata decided to ask the two again after the academy break to see how far they were planning to proceed.It is an association to support Haishin-sama, which Alphana has taken the lead in creating.Everything was set up to support Haishin, no, Kanata and to allow him to stream anywhere.In the beginning, she planned to settle only those who knew about him, but later on, she decided to take in as many people as possible.\u201c\u2026 Ara, who is that?\u201dAnd today, two new presences have emerged, who will become members numbers four and five.\u201cExcuse me! I want to join too!\u201d\u201cExcuse me. Me too.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dWhile Alphana was thinking about the future inside a room in the church, Mira appeared out of nowhere, and Shrouza emerged from a black magic circle\u2026 Thus the chaos was set in motion.A saint, an assassin, and the demon lord, who would normally never cross paths, were together\u2026\u201cNice to have you here. All for Haishin-sama.\u201d\u201cAgreed! For Haishin-sama!\u201d\u201cWithout a doubt. For Haishin\u2019s sake.\u201dOh no!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: Never reveal any hints that could expose your identity\u201cHey, guys! I\u2019ll be reading your letters today!\u201dWith the addition of the support group for Haishin and the unexpected, and in some ways predictable, faces, Kanata\u2019s life is still the same.As usual, it was now the time for streaming today.He has no bias when reading the letters, but this time, he decided to clear out all the ones that arrived during this time period.[Where do you live, Haishin-sama?][You seemed very close to Princess Maria and Saint Alphana on that day when you showed the miracle to many people, including me\u2026 Are you perhaps living in the Kingdom?][If so, I\u2019ll be happy to move in and let you know.][You\u2019ve gotta be kidding.]He was just being honest.He didn\u2019t know why they felt compelled to ask him where he lived, and he became a bit scared, maybe needing to move out.The comment section was quiet as if they were asking Kanata to tell them by all means.[This is something that I can\u2019t tell you. As for the Princess and the Saint, I told you they came a long way, didn\u2019t I? Well, it\u2019s up to you guys to believe me or not.]Only three people knew about Kanata, and he could only thank them for not leaking any information to the public.The public\u2019s opinion of him was that he possessed unlimited magical power and was a treasured existence desired by many countries.[\u2026 By the way.]It was just an afterthought and not anything serious.Kanata merely uttered a thought that came to his mind in a flash, but his words caused the comments section to get stormed.[What would you do if I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to build a country!\u2019]: I\u2019m moving!: Marry you!: I\u2019d like to form a friendly relationship with you.: Leave the security to me.: Is it a country you want?The comments flowed one after another, and it seemed that some of them were people who always made comments to him.He chuckled that they\u2019re really always here and looked over the next letter.[Do you have any plans to get married, Haishin-sama? And do you prefer beautiful people like the Princess and Saint?][\u2026 What\u2019s up with these letters today?]Kanata crossed his arms and thought about whether it had to be a matter of preference.As he reincarnated into this world, he had seen his fair share of unearthly beautiful beings.He would definitely say that Maria and Alphana were among the outstandingly beautiful girls.It was something he was embarrassed to say to their faces, but he thought it would be fun to tease them once in a while and say something like this.[If you\u2019re asking me if I like them, I\u2019d say I do. My preference is\u2026 I won\u2019t go into details because I don\u2019t like to say too much in public like this. As a man, isn\u2019t it nice to have such lovely ladies by your side? Don\u2019t you agree, all you lonely guys out there who, just like me, don\u2019t have a partner!?]Kanata\u2019s words made the comment section more excited.Maria and Alphana were a princess and a saint, but to those who didn\u2019t normally associate with them, they were like idols.He had no idea how serious they were, as he got flooded with comments from lonely men who wanted to have beautiful women like the two of them as their wives or to have a relationship with them.[Kukuku. Well, so much for talking like this. Let\u2019s move on to the\u2026 Huh?]He was about to read the next letter with great enthusiasm when he heard some strange female noises from somewhere far away, but then again, he nodded, thinking it might be his imagination since this was the men\u2019s dormitory.[Uh, let\u2019s see who\u2019s next?][Dear Haishin-sama, I am a slave living in the Empire.][Before, we used to live in a horrible environment, but thanks to Haishin-sama\u2019s message, people\u2019s view of slaves has changed, and we get treated much better.][It was said that slaves normally do not live that long, and there was a time when I, too, was frightened that I would die at any moment.][But now a very kind master has taken me in, and I live happily every day.][Thank you so much, Haishin-sama!][\u2026 I\u2019m happy for you.]By the time he finished reading it, Kanata was in tears.Although he was physically 17 years old, he still had a tendency to become emotional when he heard stories like this, a remnant from his previous life.(I used to cry during emotional scenes in video games like this.)He sounded a little nasally, which was probably heard by the listeners.But there were no obvious comments like \u2018Are you crying?\u2019 and there were no words of ridicule for Kanata, as all the listeners were aware of the situation.[All right, let\u2019s move on to next!]He moved on to the last letter of the day, but the next one was not a letter of concern or gratitude but a letter of resentment towards Kanata, which is sometimes the case.[Haishin, my life is in shambles because of you.][I was just getting manipulated, but you ruined everything by brainwashing my fianc\u00e9e.][What are you gonna do about it?][I will not forgive you for ruining the future I got promised!][I will never forgive you for turning a man\u2019s fianc\u00e9e into a fanatic!][\u2026 this looks familiar.]He had a vague idea of who had written that.He doesn\u2019t mind getting told he wouldn\u2019t be forgiven or that they don\u2019t like him. It is something he has to accept as an influencer.But it was far better than getting death threats to kill you in person like the previous bandit group.[Could it be that whoever sent this letter is from the Principality?]He had told them to find out if the victim was under a charm spell before anything. [TLN: From chapters 8 & 9.]He had already received a letter thanking him for resolving that, but he didn\u2019t mention it on the stream because he didn\u2019t want it to bring up bad memories for the victim who might be listening.He doesn\u2019t know she turned into a fanatic, and he doesn\u2019t see how his life is in shambles after his manipulation was no more\u2026 Well, Kanata may be wrong in some places but still.[Well, I don\u2019t have to respond to this kind of message. But if I were to say something, I\u2019d say, I don\u2019t care. Whether she is a fanatic or something, she\u2019s my fan. I really appreciate it. Thank you, Miss!]Kanata laughed, saying that every fan is important.However, something was going to happen in the Principality because of the letter. Something that Kanata had no way of knowing.[Well, that\u2019s it for today! Good night, everybody!]Kanata let out a big yawn and crawled into his bed, going to sleep comfortably.[Well, I don\u2019t have to respond to this kind of message. But if I were to say something, I\u2019d say, I don\u2019t care. Whether she is a fanatic or something, she\u2019s my fan. I really appreciate it. Thank you, Miss!]After such words echoed from the terminal, the man slammed his arm on it.The terminal where Haishin\u2019s voice was heard broke, but the man shouted loudly with veins appearing on his forehead.\u201cS***w you, you crook! Because of you, I\u2026 am on the verge of being abandoned by my family!\u201dThe man didn\u2019t stop screaming as he held his head up.He was a certain nobleman of the Principality of Randall, but his foothold had become so shaky that his position was under threat.It all started with a letter that arrived at Haishin\u2019s platform, informing him that a lady of the Principality of Randall got imprisoned for a crime she didn\u2019t commit and was about to be executed.\u201cFollow me. We need to examine you.\u201dYes, he was the man enchanted by the sister of the innocent lady, Lisa.The man had lost himself in the power of the demon eye, but unlike the other men who had been spit on, he had offered everything he had.He had been dipping into his own fortune and, of course, that of his younger brother and sister.He could have just dismissed it as nothing more than an inevitable consequence of the influence of the demon eye. Instead, he had the audacity to say that he had fallen under her spell because she\u2014Lisa\u2014 was unworthy of him.\u201cI did nothing wrong. It\u2019s because you didn\u2019t hold the reins of your own sister. It\u2019s not wrong to call you a stupid woman!\u201dSo this guy had a s****y personality, to begin with.Naturally, these words and actions spread, and the man walked down the path of his own destruction\u2026 Dumb enough to tempt people to ask, \u201cWho is the stupid one?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Haishin, I will never forgive you. I will find you, I promise.\u201dThe man was no longer salvageable when he thought that much about his fianc\u00e9e, that \u2018if she had been executed quietly, none of this would have happened.\u2019He also thought it was all a lie about Haishin\u2019s infinite magical power, and from a man\u2019s point of view, the trend of praising Haishin\u2019s actions as a great achievement was even nauseating.\u201cOh well, it all starts tomorrow. I\u2019m definitely going to do it.\u201dWith a firm resolve in his heart, the man lay down on his bed to face tomorrow.A while after that, the only sound in the room was the man\u2019s sleeping breath.But the door unexpectedly opened.\u201c\u2026\u201dPeople came in by the dozens.Them not being noticed at all is probably due to the magical equipment developed only in the Principality.People surrounded the bed where the man sleeps, all of them familiar to him.His brother, sister, father, mother, and the mansion\u2019s servants all looked down on the man.\u201cWhew, that was totally stupid. Hey, Lisa.\u201d\u201cYes, Lady Athena.\u201dThe last two to appear were Lisa and a woman of noble bearing who hid her mouth with a fan.\u201cI can\u2019t deal with it\u2026 it\u2019s up to you guys.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care anymore. This man is no longer a family.\u201d\u201cYes. I will not tolerate such an insult to our faithful.\u201d\u201cVery well then.\u201dThe woman who folded the fan with a snap looked down at the man with a spooky atmosphere.They say the man was never seen in the Principality again after that day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: Probably the worst thing that ever happen\u201cBy the way, I see that Alphana-sama is absent today.\u201d\u201cYeah. Something like\u2026 anemia, they say.\u201d\u201cIs she going to be alright?\u201dSuch a conversation reached Kanata\u2019s ears, who propped up on his desk as usual.The three girls sitting near each other are one of Kanata\u2019s sources of information in the academy, but their topic of conversation today was unusual.(Alphana usually takes good care of herself\u2026 I wonder if one can cure anemia with magic?)Well, whatever it is, he just hoped she got better.\u201cI heard that Maria-sama is also on a day off because of anemia.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201c\u2026 what a coincidence.\u201dApparently, Maria was also on leave today.He was worried that something had happened to them to take a leave, but if it were something serious, there would have been a commotion.He was tempted to visit them, but it was difficult because it was forbidden to go to the other dormitories, regardless of gender.\u201c\u2026 Haah, I\u2019m kinda sad.\u201dMaria, sitting in another class, and Alphana, from his same class, have always been there to talk to him.Without the two of them, there was no one for Kanata to talk to in the academy today\u2026 and that was making him a little sad.\u201cAre you lonely?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 eh?\u201dKanata involuntarily got up as he felt someone whisper in his ear.Of course, no other classmates had approached him, so none of the students spoke to Kanata.\u201c\u2026 Who?\u201dPerhaps it was a hallucination, but it was far too realistic for that.As Kanata stood up all of a sudden, his eyes met those of the three informant girls who looked at him curiously. Kanata bowed without saying a word, thanking them for the information they\u2019d been providing to him.\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe three girls responded by bowing their heads in response to Kanata.Kanata was grateful for this kind of reaction, probably because there were always classmates who would normally ignore him.Now that he was feeling good this morning, he felt fired up to do his best.\u201cGood morning, everyone. I have a little special lesson for you today.\u201dA teacher appeared and explained today\u2019s schedule.Up until now, magic classes have only been about casting and unleashing magic at a target, but today\u2019s training appears to be about battling against a human opponent.\u201cHey-hey\u2026 is it going to be okay?\u201d\u201cNo idea\u2026 but we\u2019ll figure something out.\u201dNearby, the commoner students anxiously exchanged words.Because the training was to simulate an anti-personnel battle, the class had to wear special clothes.\u201c\u2026 is a little tight.\u201dNot necessarily because of the fat, but because it was really tight.The clothes we put over our uniforms seemed to have a mechanism that blocked outside magic to block any magic about to touch their body safely.\u201cEach of you will wear this badge on your chest. Your badge will shatter if you get hit by a spell your clothes deem lethal.\u201dKanata put the badge he was given on his chest.The players can fire magic at each other and win if they can make a hit that is considered fatal to the other player.It was very easy to understand, but several students were scared because it was their first time in combat against each other.\u201cI don\u2019t care who you are. Just step forward.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it first. Hey, you there, I\u2019m ready.\u201d\u201cUhe?\u201dAn elated noble student came forward and pointed his finger at a scared commoner student.How would a commoner student deal with a self-confident aristocratic student while being obviously weak and bullied\u2026 the result was disappointing.\u201cUwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\u201dBeing in the same class as Kanata means that they are promising candidates with S-rank magic power, but when it comes to fighting, it seems to be a different story.The commoner student fell on his buttocks as he was scared, and the magic released by the noble student hit him directly.At that moment, there was a crack sound, and the badge shattered, forcing the teacher to intervene.\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d\u201c\u2026 you dumb small fry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe commoner student bit his lip in frustration and walked back.As for Kanata, he couldn\u2019t help but think he ought to be a little more aggressive. However, since the attitude between commoners and aristocrats varied, it isn\u2019t surprising discrepancies existed.\u201cKukuk, you\u2019re next.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ha?\u201dAnd it was Kanata who got called.He had no particular impression, but the other party was an aristocratic student who always looked at Kanata in a way Kanata did not like. He probably wondered if today was the perfect opportunity for him since Alphana was not there.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cNothing, I\u2019m going.\u201dKanata said to the teacher and walked into the center.When Kanata stepped forward, almost all of the students who shouted at him were aristocrats. Even some commoners looked at him as if they wanted to see him beaten to a pulp.\u201cWhat are you doing? Hurry up and come inside.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dHe smiled ferociously as he stood before the noble student.The moment the teacher started the battle, the noble student immediately sprang into action.\u201cFIREAAAAHHHHHHH!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe noble student who created a fireball in his palm released it at Kanata.Kanata didn\u2019t react particularly well and took it head-on\u2026 but he didn\u2019t hear the badge crack, and the fireball vanished completely when it touched Kanata.\u201cW-what the h**l?\u201dEven the teachers were awestruck by the current phenomenon.What Kanata did was simple. He just generated a thick layer of magic power in front of his body.\u201c\u2026 this is how it\u2019s going to be. Come to think of it. It\u2019s my first time in person.\u201dKanata\u2019s magic power was infinite, so the thickness of the magic power wall was not like an ordinary person\u2019s.Therefore, the level of the magic power of a mere noble student can never break through Kanata\u2019s infinity.(\u2026 I never thought my knowledge of manga from my previous life would come in handy like this.)He was self-trained in developing magic, but how to use it is an application of what he learned in class and what he saw in the manga.He believed it was worth reading a scene like this in his favourite manga, where they used magic itself to build a wall.\u201cWell then, I guess it\u2019s our turn to\u2026 Fire.\u201dHe created a fireball, exactly like the magic released by his opponent, and threw it straight at a frightening speed at the noble student directly.The badge shattered firmly as the fireball hit him perfectly.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dThe noble student fell on his butt in dismay and glared at Kanata with a snap as he noticed the broken badge.If you win, you get stared at. If you lose, you get ridiculed\u2026 and it was a needle in a haystack.\u201cI knew you were the best in your class.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dThe teacher tapped on his shoulder as he praised him.The stares from those around him became even more intense, but Kanata also smiled, as it was not unpleasant to be praised by a teacher.\u201c\u2026 So frustrating. But even if the teacher says it, nothing will change. I won\u2019t let it escalate into something that can\u2019t be undone. You can rest assured of that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. Not everyone\u2019s the same, and there are people who are still friends with me.\u201dMaria and Alphana were the only two. Sadly, he couldn\u2019t say it.From then on, Kanata spent his time being stared at by the aristocratic students, but it was inevitable that they would come to mock him as Alphana was not around.\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cHey, come here.\u201dAfter all the classes were over, and when he was just about to leave, the aristocratic student from before stood in front of Kanata with four of his friends.\u201cHey, stop it.\u201d\u201cShut the f**k up, b*tch.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dOne of the three informant girls tried to stop him but was intimidated.She looked apologetic, but Kanata was really grateful that she tried to protect him.\u201c\u2026 Hey! What do you think would happen if Lady Saint found out about this!?\u201dOops, Kanata tilted his head.Another student who intervened was one of the commoner students, and he also came to cover Kanata.But the noble student stood before him and punched him in the cheek.\u201cI said. Shut up. You want me to do it to you first?\u201d\u201cHiiiiiii!\u201dAnd he quickly ran away.Now Kanata was isolated and helpless, and although he could resist if they did something to him, he apparently had to waste his time.(Damn it, I just want to go home and get ready for the stream.)And he picked up his luggage to go home.Of course, the noble students reached out to Kanata to stop him\u2026 and something strange happened.\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201dHis\u2026 no, all the time around Kanata stopped.In the colourless gray world, Kanata alone remains conscious as if left behind.\u201c\u2026 what the h**l is this?\u201dIt was more than a little frightening sight.Kanata was the only one moving his body, while everything else didn\u2019t.Not only humans but even creatures like flying birds had stopped.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHow disrespectful. You are not an existence that a lowly human should be allowed to touch.\u201dSnap, something stuck to his back.Kanata\u2019s body shook with fear, but the voice sounded familiar.\u201cOh, but I\u2019d say they\u2019re lowly, except for those who adore you.\u201dThe voice was so clear that it made him even more scared.When Kanata turned around to see the presence attached to his back, he was surprised to see\u2026\u201c\u2026 uheh.\u201dBeautiful pure white wings and stunning white hair longer than her height\u2026 So good so far.No matter how you looked at her, she had a sacred aura, but her clothes ruined everything.[I am Haishin]Yes, she was wearing that shirt.Forgetting all about the fact that time had stopped, Kanata couldn\u2019t help but be stunned, wondering who this crazy girl was.\u201cLet\u2019s just erase them for the time being because they did something unforgivable.\u201d\u201cEhh\u2015\u2015\u201dPang. He heard something pop five times.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: Goddess-sama\u2019s scary\u2026 really scary!\u201c!?\u201dKanata turned around involuntarily.Partly because he heard a popping sound, like a balloon bursting, and partly because his brain had a cruel imagination that said, \u201cNo way.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh.\u201dHowever, contrary to Kanata\u2019s expectations, they were alive and well.There was nothing strange about them, and except for how time had stopped, they retained the form of a human being, no different from Kanata.\u201cOh dear, did you think maybe I killed them?\u201d\u201c\u2026 No.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so offended,\u201d she giggled as she called herself a goddess.Kanata wondered if it was wrong of him to have doubted her even for a moment, but it was natural for him to think of the unexpected if he got told that she would erase them for him.Although these noble students were not Kanata\u2019s friends but enemies, he never considered taking their lives, even as a joke.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Even if I erase them, I can just create new ones.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ha?\u201dAnd the Goddess continued talking in front of Kanata, who was dumbfounded.\u201cExistence can be created and can be erased at my will. Even if the world gets destroyed, I can re-create a new one.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a hassle to build it again, but it\u2019ll be just fine after that.\u201dGoddess\u2026 No, Kanata doubted if she really was a goddess.According to lore in the Kingdom, the Goddess is a benevolent woman. The church which Alphana belongs to is dedicated to her.A deity is supposed to be comforting to one\u2019s heart and soul, a sacred figure.\u201c\u2026 I.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dAs she whispered sweetly, Kanata looked firmly ahead.It didn\u2019t matter who she was; he couldn\u2019t agree with her.\u201cI disagree. You are certainly something other than a human being\u2026 and you are certainly a terrifying existence if you can stop time in this way. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can just recreate it, you see?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Heh?\u201dShe laughed, amused.She looked straight into his eyes, waiting for the next words to follow.While sensing the slightly dangerous passion in his eyes, Kanata spun his words firmly.\u201cThere are plenty of people who don\u2019t like me either or think I\u2019m a bit of a jerk. However, not being liked by everyone is also a way of life, and how you deal with it is a way of life. At least, I don\u2019t think I should get rid of these guys just because I don\u2019t like them.\u201d\u201cNo doubt. You tried to face them in your own way.\u201d\u201cWell, nine out of ten, it\u2019s going to be more than an argument,\u201d Kanata chuckled.\u201c\u2026 though those around you are quite radical.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I understand now\u2026 you are that kind of person.\u201dHer slightly terrifying demeanour was gone, and she approached Kanata with a gentle smile.What\u2019s she doing? Before Kanata could speak up, he got hugged, and his face buried in the Haishin-sama T-shirt covering her ample bosom.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. What I just said was just a metaphor to see how you would react. I wanted to see what kind of person you are, a man of unlimited magic power.\u201d\u201c\u2026 You really are the goddess?\u201d\u201cYes. I am~?\u201dKanata nodded confidently, \u201cIndeed, this supreme feeling on my face is the power of the Goddess.\u201d\u201c\u2026 But why is the goddess in this outfit?\u201d\u201cOh, well, it\u2019s only natural since I made it. I also decorated my statue as an oracle to those in the church who worship me.\u201d\u201cWhat were you doing\u2026\u201dApparently, it was the Goddess who put that shirt on her statue.During his time as Haishin, he has seen a lot of crazy people and has made some crazy acquaintances like Mira, but\u2026 it seems that this Goddess is even worse than that.\u201cAs a goddess watching over the world, I really enjoy your work. I\u2019ve been watching you from the very beginning, so I am the very first fan, you see?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Seriously?\u201d\u201cYeah. I also remember you weren\u2019t quite passionate back then, and once you even left your listeners alone and went to the restroom.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe started calling himself Haishin because he wanted to stream, but, of course, in the beginning, there were not many listeners, and if you asked Kanata back then if he was that motivated, he actually wasn\u2019t.He thought this was about as good as it got and even went to the restroom during the stream, but apparently, she has known Haishin since really quite early on.\u201cAnd\u2026 What about this place?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s done is done because I, as a goddess, am like this.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not something you say with confidence!\u201dSaying that, he lightly tapped the Goddess on her shoulder with his knuckles.Although he was not that strong, Kanata was nervous, wondering if it was rude to a goddess, no matter how crazy she was.\u201cS-sorry!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been able to make a tsukkomi like that.\u201dHe was kind of impressed.But then again, Kanata turned her attention to the Goddess.Aside from the fact that it looks infinitely more sacred as an atmosphere, the Haishin-sama shirt was the only foreign object.He was irritated by the man in black and the mask, questioning why he looked so haughty, but Kanata exhaled a sigh, \u201cOh, this is me.\u201d\u201cPerhaps, you want this?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201dHe spat out that I didn\u2019t need it because it was his own dark historical figure.However, as far as Kanata knew, this shirt would get mass-produced to reach the people of the Kingdom and, ultimately, to the listeners in other countries. Kanata clutched his chest, thinking that the price of fame was too great to pay for it.\u201cKanata.\u201d\u201cUh, yes.\u201dHe looked at her again as she called his name.\u201cI can\u2019t get in touch with you much, but I\u2019ll be keeping an eye on the world and looking forward to your streaming!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a strange pressure when even the Goddess is listening\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me being a goddess or anything. I\u2019m just a listener\u2026 and you see, I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s watching over you, either.\u201dKanata nodded and said, \u201cShe\u2019s indeed a goddess.\u201d\u201cRight now, I\u2019m in the process of spreading the word about you to my peers. I\u2019m sure there will be more and more fans of yours!\u201d\u2026 Apparently, there will be more and more listeners.Then the Goddess waved bye-bye in a lighthearted manner and disappeared, and the time she had stopped around Kanata began to move.(\u2026 What\u2019s seriously going on in this world?)He muttered in his mind again.Now, since time would begin to move, there was something that must be dealt with\u2014 yes, the noble students who tried to fight Kanata.Kanata turned to them with a troublesome expression on his face, and\u2026 they suddenly turned pale and began to tremble.\u201cArghhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026 nooooooooooooooo!\u201d\u201cMy body\u2026 back to normal\u2026 back to normal \u2026 ugh\u2026 hahahahahahahaha! !!!?\u201dSo they started screaming like madmen.The obviously insane behaviour caused not just Kanata but also the students in the classroom to turn their eyes to see what was going on.Eventually, teachers showed up shortly afterwards and took them away.Kanata was left behind all of a sudden, but\u2026 it seems needless to say that the Goddess appears to have planted something in their mind.p\u201c\u2026 She\u2019s seriously scary.\u201dIn a manner of speaking, they returned to the academy a few days later.Their appearance has remained unchanged, and as nobles, they looked down on the commoners, but never since then have they spoken out or looked at Kanata.[\u2026 I\u2019m kinda tired these days. I\u2019ve been through a lot, a lot!]She, the Goddess Isla, giggled at the voice coming from the terminal.She was in a position to watch over the world as a goddess, but she felt it was also her duty to listen to Haishin in this way.Isla was so captivated by Haishin that she didn\u2019t care what a goddess was or even the world.\u201c\u2026 I wonder if I should prepare a body for descending into the world where Kanata is.\u201dThat would be wonderful, she said.She still looked as holy as ever, but she was still wearing the same Haishin-sama shirt that ruined everything.A very beautiful woman came up to her.\u201cYou\u2019re watching him again.\u201d\u201cOf course. It\u2019s what I live for.\u201dShe said proudly.Incidentally, the woman who spoke to Isla was also wearing a Haishin-sama T-shirt\u2026 apparently, it was too late.Give up, Kanata. This world is really strange, seriously.This aside, there was almost no doubt about what Isla said in her conversation with Kanata.In other words, when she uttered that she could erase and recreate anything, she meant it.Being a goddess, she has no idea of the human heart, and when Kanata looked back to see what he had been expecting, she panicked and regenerated the noble student, wondering if she had overdone it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: Don\u2019t use people\u2019s names without permission for ads!Kanata\u2019s days remained the same, even after meeting Goddess Isla, a veritable heavenly being.Although he has been active in streaming every day since then, there has not been a single contact from Isla since then, as she said.Well, since a goddess is a divine being, one might lose appreciation for her after encountering her so many times.\u201c\u2026 Haah.\u201dNevertheless, the five aristocratic students in question have changed since then, and Kanata definitely understood that she had done something\u2026 wrong, or so he thinks.\u201cKanata-kun, what\u2019s troubling you?\u201d\u201cKanata-sama, is something troubling you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s nothing.\u201dMaybe because he was in a daze thinking about Isla like that, he got approached by Maria and Alphana, who sat on both sides of him.Putting Isla aside for the moment, these two were the ones that were bothering Kanata right now.Starting when they took a day off due to anemia at the same time, the girls got so close to him that, when they gathered during recess or after school, their shoulders brushed against his.\u201c\u2026 isn\u2019t this kind of close?\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u2018\u2014 I don\u2019t think so.\u2019 They both tilted their heads as if to say that.While they maintained a certain distance in classrooms and other places in public, it is easy to see how much they changed when they were alone like this.With the sweet, flowery smell of their fragrance and the distance between them, which sometimes almost touches his shoulders, Kanata\u2019s cheeks tightened desperately.(Is it possible that they both have a crush on me? No! I\u2019m confused\u2026 Haah\u2026 This is so stupid!)Kanata let out a sigh at the impossible thought.A sweet romance with a princess and a saint, both important positions in the country, is certainly something to be longed for, but it is permissible only when it is a fantasy.There is a reason they gathered like this, despite their delusions.\u201cSo, Kanata-sama, aside from the T-shirt, the badges will be ready soon.\u201dThey are currently working on merchandise for the fans of Haishin, not the followers of Haishin\u2026 but the earliest they are likely to complete is a badge.It is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. So, one could attach it to their clothes or bag.Kanata was not sure if it would sell or not, but who knows\u2026\u201cHere\u2019s a sample, by the way.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Oh.\u201dThe picture drawn on the round and commonly-seen badge was that of Haishin at that time.It was the cosplay of a guy who belongs to an evil organization, but apparently, this is how the world sees him, and for the time being, it is how he will be known as Haishin.\u201cSomehow, with this kind of mask and black clothes, I\u2019m afraid an imposter will show up.\u201dAnyone can become Haishin by faking his voice.Well, it is unclear whether they can display the charisma that Kanata unintentionally shows over the streaming, so perhaps in that sense, there is not too much to worry about.\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be anyone who can imitate your prestige, Kanata-sama\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Kanata-kun, your listeners will know right away when it\u2019s a fake.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you both trust me so much.\u201dKanata muttered quietly.After that, Maria regretfully left because of her official duties as a princess, leaving just him and Alphana.\u201cBut still, this place is a haven. No one actually comes here.\u201d\u201cYeah, I guess so. As for me, I\u2019m just relieved they don\u2019t see me having a secret meeting with a saint and a princess.\u201d\u201cAra, a secret meeting\u2026 sounds lovely \u266a.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dKanata expressed his concern that the church would kill him if they knew that he was meeting secretly with the Saint and the Princess, but Alphana shook her head and said that would not be the case.\u201cThere is no rule saying you can\u2019t meet men just because you\u2019re a saint, and you won\u2019t get disqualified if you lose your virginity. So I don\u2019t think they would make a fuss over something as trivial as a secret meeting.\u201d\u201cNo virgins or girls of your age say that.\u201dHe made tsukkomi there.\u201cSo you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201c? Yeah, got it.\u201dApparently, there was no need to worry about the secret meeting.Kanata nodded, and Alphana was happy to see him, making a clenched fist, which was also a mystery to Kanata, but the topic moved on to something else.\u201cAnd by the way, you got to know Mira, too.\u201d\u201cYes. Mira-san is member number 4. Well, I didn\u2019t expect a girl our age to be a legendary assassin.\u201dFor the record, Mira had already revealed her true identity, but as for Shrouza, she had not told her that she was a demon king, just that she was part of a demon tribe.\u201cAnd you welcomed them well, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes. Because we\u2019re all in the same boat.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201d\u201cYes \u266a.\u201dMaybe it was better of him not to say anything.(For Shrouza to be involved with Alphana like this\u2026 she must have known who she is. I mean, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s that careless, but I fear she doesn\u2019t get exposed in a way that she doesn\u2019t want to.)Kanata thought this was something he would have to be even more careful of.\u201cSpeaking of which, Kanata-sama, do you know anyone from Maria\u2019s family?\u201d\u201cEh? Well, the king and queen, right? That\u2019s all I know.\u201dMaria is the kingdom\u2019s princess, so her family is naturally the king and queen, while her siblings are princes and princesses.He doesn\u2019t have any particular interest in them, and he\u2019s not from Royal Capital, so there are more things he doesn\u2019t know about them that he should.\u201cActually, I recently heard that Maria\u2019s brother and sister have been pestering her for a long time that they want to see Haishin-sama too, and they keep asking her how they can see him when she returns to the castle!\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dNo wonder Maria was looking tired lately.It\u2019s not crazy to think that when your family meets a celebrity, you want to meet them too.Kanata also thought that if his relatives got to know a famous person, he would surely mention that he wanted to meet them too.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m indebted to Maria, but.\u201d\u201cFufu, I\u2019ll ask you to be patient for a while.\u201d\u2018Sorry Maria,\u2019 Kanata apologized in his mind.Kanata returned to the dormitory after parting with Alphana, as it was already getting late.\u201c\u2026 smell so good\u2026 stop thinking, stop! They\u2019ll call you a pervert.\u201dEarlier, he mentioned that he was indebted to Maria, but it was Alphana who was helping Kanata even more.Within the academy, she looks after him as long as she\u2019s present there, and even if someone other than the five people in question seems to get involved with him, she moves to warn them in advance\u2026 Kanata truly believes that she has compassion that lives up to the name of a saint.\u201c\u2026 Well, got to stream tonight. I wonder what to talk about today.\u201dThe days have been really peaceful, except for the Goddess Isla.As for the Haishin goods, he was fighting it as if it was a stomachache, but since this was something due to his fame, he just had to accept it.Then, as he was screaming, a letter of concern arrived at Kanata.[Haishin-sama! Today, I met some people in the city who were collecting money to support you.][As a fan of Haishin-sama myself, I deposited some money to help you in any way I could!][Keep up the good work!][\u2026 Wait, what do you mean?]That was new to him.Someone was raising money to support Haishin, something Kanata did not comprehend and did not wish to do.In the first place, support in the form of money had already been established as online donations, so there was no need to raise funds in such an indirect way.[\u2026 isn\u2019t that some kind of scam or something?]Kanata wondered if that was a scam.Of course, it was also possible to have good intentions. He couldn\u2019t say for sure.However, if someone is trying to line their pockets in the name of Haishin, they can\u2019t be ignored.[Hey? Did you guys give them money, too?]He received comments from people who witnessed the moment, and Kanata ended the stream by saying it would be better to look into it right away.He opened the windowpane, and Mira was waiting for me, as she should have been.\u201cCan I help you, Kanata-sama?\u201d\u201cYou scared the s**t out of me\u2026 but you were listening, right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cCan you do it?\u201d\u201cLeave it to me.\u201dSaying Mira disappeared.He wondered what the purpose of this was, but it was probably just some people wanting to raise money through a scam.It seems that not only combat but also information gathering is a piece of cake for Mira.And further, with the help of the Demon King, they were able to find out who was behind all this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33: Roadmap of the Demon Tribe aspiring to be civilized listeners\u201cKukuku, as expected of Haishin-sama.\u201dHe muttered to himself in one of the ramshackle huts.His name was Pacul, a commoner with no distinguishing features.\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m raising this much money\u2026 it\u2019s a piece of cake.\u201dPacul smiled ecstatically at the sound of gold coins jingling in the bag.He was the one who raised money by using the hottest name of the moment, Haishin, and lying about supporting him.Nowadays, few people don\u2019t know about Haishin, and many children don\u2019t doubt him because he has a growing fan base among them.\u201cIt feels good to make money this easy. Just a little bit of pretending to be a follower of Haishin, and people won\u2019t think I\u2019m lying.\u201dPacul felt no guilt for using his name without permission or taking money from pure children.In the first place, he was an evil man who never worked and made his living by fraud and burglary.He was skillful and had no evidence against him\u2026 he didn\u2019t sneak into a noble\u2019s residence, but only of commoners of the same status, so he did not get caught.\u201cIt\u2019s not a crime that I can\u2019t outwardly speak about. Besides, I\u2019m a listener who listens to Haishin. Feels much better, hahaha!\u201dSure, he was a listener, but he\u2019s not qualified to call himself one when did something like this.In the first place, using someone\u2019s name without permission is neither legal nor proper, and it\u2019s worse when the money raised is not sent to the person in question but only used to line your own pockets.\u201cWell, the feeling\u2019s mutual, Haishin. You get paid to talk just as much as I do, so we\u2019re both guilty of the same thing.\u201dThis man, it seems, was rotten to the end.But in a way, it was inevitable that people would talk about the great things that Haishin was doing in this way.Many people in this world are jealous because they think he is getting paid just to talk into a terminal, and there are many like Pacul who are thinking of either tricking him or taking advantage of him.\u201c\u2026 An?\u201dBut he didn\u2019t truly understand Haishin\u2019s influence.Rather, he does not know the fear of those enchanted and who adore Haishin.\u201c\u2026 what?\u201dThe time was night, around when it was expected for Haishin to be streaming.Something was loitering by the hut he was in, so Pacul leaned over to look and see what the h**l it was.\u201c\u2026 Hey, hey. What\u2019s up with you, Babe?\u201dThere she was, a beautiful woman.Her revealing, rag-like clothing was clearly inviting to men, and her dark hair, dyed like the dark night, seemed to glow in the moonlight.\u201c\u2026 Ha \u266a.\u201d\u201c?\u201dThe woman exhaled, and Pacul quickly ran out of the hut.As his body wouldn\u2019t listen to him, he jumped on the woman with an unusual degree of absentmindedness.\u201cAn \u266a.\u201d\u201cHehe, what are you doing here all alone?\u201d\u2018Funny, funny,\u2019 Pacul kept thinking.The woman in front of him smiled happily even though she had been grabbed by Pacul, looking like she would not complain if he attacked her at that moment.Why does he desire women so much? Why does he feel like an ape, unable to control his excitement? What little reason he had remained appealed to him about these unintelligible feelings.\u201cYou\u2019re a tough one, aren\u2019t you? What are you going to do about it?\u201dAlthough she was a beautiful woman, her voice was husky, and her manner of speaking was somewhat masculine, but she was definitely a woman.Pacul drooled as he hugged her voluptuous body.\u201cHeh\u2026 heheheheheheheh.\u201dThere was not a shred of reason left in Pacul.The questioning appeals he had felt earlier no longer made sense, and Pacul could only see the woman in front of her now.\u201cMm-hm. You\u2019ve got a strong body\u2026 That\u2019s going to work well.\u201dThe woman patted him on the back, and he fell to the ground with his eyes closed, like a child nursed by its mother.He was not dead. He just fell asleep, still breathing.\u201cWonderful. But\u2026 the atmosphere is too calm, and it\u2019s driving me crazy. I see, so this is what you call a succubus.\u201dA man appeared wearing armour. He looked at the woman and mouthed the word succubus.At that moment, with a bashing sound, the woman sprouted wings and a tail.\u201cThat guy\u2019s tough as nails. As I said, he\u2019s going to work hard.\u201d\u201cI know. We\u2019ll bring him and make him pay for what he\u2019s done immediately\u2026 Well. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll make it back out alive.\u201dThe woman was a succubus and a demonkind, while the man was just a human. This scene was quite unusual.Although demons have conveyed an offer of a ceasefire to the human world, the two sides have yet to come to terms with each other.But they formed a cooperative relationship with one goal in mind.\u201cI won\u2019t allow anyone to use Haishin-sama\u2019s name without permission. That goes for you too, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019m a big fan of his too! Hey, hey! The stream\u2019s about to start!\u201d\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s what it was about.So this succubus woman and soldier were also big fans of Haishin.\u201cEven so, since you\u2019re a demon, I thought you\u2019d kill him.\u201d\u201cHaishin-sama told us not to harm people needlessly, and that\u2019s what the Demon Lord has told us all. We\u2019re sworn to stay close to Haishin-sama and be a civilized listeners wherever we go.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dA good listener. That\u2019s what the demons were trying to keep in mind.The soldier man left with the sleeping man on his back, wishing the humans would do the same.The fact that someone using Haishin\u2019s name was collecting money made Haishin try to move on his own, but the demons moved faster than that.\u201cHave I been of any use to you, Haishin-sama? I\u2019m the one who taught her.\u201dThe woman mentioned her as a certain former assassin.Demons can see other people\u2019s magic, so they can easily find out about Haishin\u2019s true identity as soon as they see him.Still, they don\u2019t go where he\u2019s likely to be because they\u2019re proud to be his followers to all intents and purposes.\u201cWe listeners are the reflection of Haisin-sama\u2026 therefore, if we were to be stupid\u2026 it would be Haishin-sama who would get inconvenienced!\u201dUnbeknownst to humans, there have recently been disturbing movements among the demons. A demon belonging to a radical faction has fled to the human world, but it is currently under investigation.This woman also happened to be in the middle of her mission when she learned of Pacul\u2019s activities in the vicinity, so she dealt with the situation.\u201cA demon who likes to fight\u2026 Oh dear. I guess he\u2019s not in his right mind\u2026 I wonder where the h**l he ran off to. I\u2019ll have to check out some more remote villages and settlements.\u201dThe woman muttered and took off with her wings.Then, Pacul, one of the frauds, was successfully taken down by the local security forces.Thus the matter of fraudulent fundraising using the name of Haishin has been resolved.He got informed of this through Mira. The demon-kinds helped him out in this regard.However, Kanata also told his listeners in the stream to be careful because he had never done this kind of fundraising and would never do it in the future.Now that the matter was settled and a brief peace had come\u2026 Kanata was now in the building considered the largest in the royal capital\u2014 the Royal Castle.\u201cOhh, so you\u2019re Haishin-sama!\u201d\u201cWell, Haishin-sama, how I\u2019ve missed you!\u201dThe King and Queen were delighted, dancing madly in front of him, and Maria\u2019s siblings were further behind them with their eyes wide open as they wanted to talk to him too.\u201cFather and mother, don\u2019t annoy Haishin-sama too much.\u201d\u201cYes. Your Highness And Her Highness, if you bother Haishin-sama too much, I won\u2019t keep quiet either.\u201dThe air was tense and unpleasant, but Alphana\u2019s intimidation didn\u2019t bother them, as they were still shedding tears of joy at the sight of Haishin.(\u2026 I\u2019m just here to see Maria\u2019s younger brother and sister.)Wearing a black robe, Kanata let out a tired sigh under his mask.He\u2019s merely a streamer\u2026 a Haishinsha, you may ask, but Kanata was bewildered to get treated like a guest of honour, and it made him think again about his position.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34: Saint\u2019s actions are a sign of peaceIt was simply a part of the thank-you.\u201cHey, Maria, you don\u2019t mind if I meet your brother and sister, do you?\u201dHe felt indebted not only to Alphana but also to Maria for her care.He likes the way she treats everyone at the academy without using her prestige as a princess, and more than anything else, she has helped him in many ways, including with the matter of the orb.Even if their underlying desire is to be useful to Haishin, they still are kind towards Kanata.\u201cYou want to, really?\u201dKanata nodded.He would show up as Haishin but wouldn\u2019t meet them as Kanata, to which Maria nodded, and Alphana said she\u2019d help.Having, once again, taken out his black robe and mask, which were now almost black history, Kanata made his way to the stage as a Haishin.\u201cFather, we would love to speak with him too.\u201d\u201cYes, Father! It\u2019s not fair that Maria\u2019s always by his side.\u201dBut, well. It was Kanata and his party\u2019s lack of attention that caused such a big commotion when originally, they were only to meet her younger brother and sister.Alphana stood firmly by Kanata\u2019s side, and Maria, too, was looking at her family with caution and an impatience that was evident in her hands as she was panicking that her family was in serious trouble.(\u2026 Well, it\u2019s in the castle\u2026 No, it\u2019s just a commotion between them. I\u2019d hate it if it were a national assembly, though don\u2019t worry about it that much, Maria.)That being said, he couldn\u2019t convey the voice in his heart to her.The King and Queen, together with Maria\u2019s older and younger siblings, stood reservedly in the back with a twinkle in their eyes.He wanted to get his business done quickly, but no matter how much of a Haishin he was, he couldn\u2019t do anything on his own in front of the country\u2019s king\u2026 but he still wished to reassure Maria.\u201cMaria.\u201dKanata muttered, and suddenly the air around her died.No, death was an overstatement, but it had gone quiet.\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s just another price to pay for fame.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Haishin-sama.\u201dShe did not say \u2018Kanata\u2019 but the word \u2018Haishin.\u2019 Once again, it made his batch itch to get referred to as \u2018-sama\u2019 in this way.Alphana always calls him Kanata-sama, but he has gotten used to that and stopped minding it.\u201cOnce again, I\u2019m Haishin. Nice to meet you.\u201dOnly now, at this moment, Kanata decided to become Haishin.He didn\u2019t have to put much effort to be Haishin because it is his other self, but he always has an imposing appearance when he speaks to a terminal.\u201cOh, yeah\u2026 It\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d\u201cThank you for coming here.\u201dBoth of them stopped talking, overwhelmed by Kanata\u2019s presence.\u201cMaria and Alphana have been taking good care of me for some time now. So, I\u2019ve always wanted to thank her for her support, and coincidentally I heard her siblings want to meet me.\u201dSaying that, Kanata started to walk.The younger brother and sister were waiting with the two maids, but both looked somewhat nervous with their sparkling eyes.\u201cI\u2019m Haishin. Can I ask you both your names?\u201dKanata laughed under his mask at how silly he looked.\u201cIt\u2019s Ars!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Fiona\u2026!?\u201dArs and Fiona. That seems to be their name.Kanata reached out and stroked Ars and Fiona\u2019s heads as he continued speaking.\u201cArs and Fiona. Wonderful names.\u201dKanata laughed a little at Ars, who tried acting cool, and Fiona, who bit her lip and shied away in embarrassment.He could feel the Kings\u2019 eyes on him while he talked with them, but today they were the only purpose of his visit.\u2018I\u2019m going to ask you to be patient,\u2019 Kanata thought.(Originally, something like this wouldn\u2019t be possible. Although I can\u2019t complain about being slashed in the back for being rude.)But it was Haishin\u2019s prestige that made it possible.While it felt somewhat incredulous, Kanata thought of the situation slightly differently because it was so fluffy, just like in a manga.This was because the king of a country should not have been so humble to Kanata.\u201cHaishin-sama, can you do the usual?\u201d\u201cThe usual?\u201d\u2018What\u2019s the usual?\u2019 He asked himself, and Fiona continued to speak.\u201cUm, that\u2026 when you start your stream!\u201d\u201cOh, that.\u201dKanata nodded. That much is fine.\u201cHey, guys! It\u2019s that time of the day again!!\u201d\u201cOwaaaa \u266a\u201d\u201cA-amazing!\u201dIncidentally, the Queen almost collapsed as if she had anemia when she heard Kanata\u2019s voice just now, but the King properly caught her.\u201cAh, I\u2019m dizzy\u2026\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dThe maid who was listening nearby collapsed as if she had suffered from an attack.They didn\u2019t seem to mind that a person had fallen. The other maid, let alone Alphana, didn\u2019t want to move at all.Over the next while, Kanata spent time with Ars and Fiona.\u201cI think it\u2019s important to speak openly and objectively at all times. Of course, depending on the content, one may side with one side or the other.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAlthough it was only a few dozen minutes, the two left with regretful looks on their faces, as if they were about to go study.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see a little kid smile.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dWhile Maria somehow managed to keep her family from going out of control, Alphana stayed by Kanata\u2019s side the whole time.The way she acted like a saint brought him peace, and with Alphana by his side, he didn\u2019t feel nervous at all, even in the royal castle.\u201cWell, I think that\u2019s enough for now.\u201d\u201cAs you wish.\u201dKanata started to walk away, deciding to leave now that he had done what he needed to do.Naturally, the kings still want to talk to him, but they still seem to respect Kanata\u2019s will to no end.\u201cHaishin-sama, it is because of people like you that this country has changed. Whether it\u2019s about slavery or status, we\u2019ve moved a lot because of your voice.\u201dThe King\u2019s words were an honour, but as Kanata, he had something to say.\u201cPart of me wishes you\u2019d made a move before I said anything.\u201d\u201cRight\u2026 I agree with you.\u201dThe King nodded with his eyes closed as he took Kanata\u2019s words deeply to heart.Whether it was about slaves or about status, that\u2019s something he had to work on himself rather than someone else telling him what to do to make the country better.If Kanata hadn\u2019t moved\u2026 Well, someone else would have, but if you were to ask him if he sincerely was happy to be thanked for that, he was not.\u201cThis country\u2019s a good place.\u201dThose were words from Kanata\u2019s heart.He didn\u2019t know what they would think of that small talk, but Kanata decided to leave the royal castle with such words.He smiled at the people who looked very disappointed and said he would come back if he had the chance.[Then let the full might of the nation greet you!]Kanata concluded that he would never come.Maria parted from him, as she still had business at the castle, but Alphana stayed by Kanata\u2019s side as usual.Kanata couldn\u2019t stay in his Haishin form forever, so Alphana took him to the church.\u201c\u2026 phew.\u201dHe went directly from the castle to a room in the church without getting noticed thanks to Alphana\u2019s magic that made his presence invisible.When he took off his black robe, the sweltering heat escaped him.The temperature was quite high, as it was almost summer, and he was drenched in sweat under the black robe and mask.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m going to get a heat stroke.\u201dKanata clearly experienced with his own body how hard it was to work in a stuffed animal costume in his previous life and the reason why.Alphana came into the room as he finished getting dressed.\u201cGood work, Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201cThanks for your help. Alphana.\u201d\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m happy if I can be of help to Kanata-sama.\u201dKanata was really impressed with how kind she was.As for the costume he had, he gave it to Alphana as she said she would put a cleaning spell on it, and Kanata excused himself as he needed to go to the bathroom.It was a few minutes before he headed to the bathroom and back, and when he returned to his room, Kanata tilted his head.\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Nothing.\u201dHe felt a sweet scent wafting somewhere in the room.He didn\u2019t find out what it was, but afterwards, he returned to his dormitory to enjoy the snacks Alphana had prepared for him.A Saint. Written as \u2018holy woman\u2019 and read as \u2018saint.\u2019[EDN: Talking about the kanji.]A saint is also one of the country\u2019s representatives, not to mention a sacred being.Many people in the kingdom admire the Saint and revere her as a precious being, praising her achievements.\u201c\u2026 Han\u2026 han \u266a.\u201dJust after Kanata headed to the bathroom, Alphana was holding the black robe Kanata had taken off to her body with all her might.Sniffling, a heart mark appeared on her eyes.Combined with the presence of Kanata and confirming that no one was nearby, Alphana buried her face in her black robe\u2026 and visited the Goddess, albeit for a moment.\u201cGo back. But before that, give it to me.\u201dShe felt like she was told something she didn\u2019t know very well, but Alphana returned.\u201c\u2026 Is something wrong?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing? Ufufu \u266a.\u201dWritten as \u2018holy woman\u2019 and read as \u2018saint.\u2019But a saint is also a human being and a girl\u2026 Well, I guess they do at least this much.But it could be considered the other way around.This world was a bleak place not too long ago, and there are still small parts where conflict continues.But the fact that Alphana could spend her time leisurely like this was proof that the kingdom was at peace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35: Otherworldly ASMR\u201cNext week, everyone in the class will form groups and head for the dungeon.\u201dThe whole class was excited by the teacher\u2019s words.Many people\u2019s idea of a dungeon is a place where adventurers continue to challenge themselves, and the deeper they go, the more powerful monsters, traps, and treasures lie in wait.Their image isn\u2019t wrong, and it could be called a source of funds for those who can fight in this world in a sense, whether they want to get rich or earn steadily.\u201cDungeon, huh\u2026 I wonder if there are scary monsters out there?\u201d\u201cOf course, there will be. But I\u2019m looking forward to it!\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m scared, seriously.\u201d\u201cReally? I don\u2019t think anything in particular.\u201dEveryone seemed to have their own approach to the dungeon, with some feeling anxious and others excited and looking forward to it with all their heart.\u201cThis will be a real battle against magical beasts, and of course, if you get caught in a mysterious trap, your life may be in danger. So, be careful, kids. You don\u2019t want to die at such a young age yet, do you?\u201dThe teacher\u2019s words were cold, but they can only lead to a better future if they are harsh.It was a brief explanation, and it seems that two teachers and a party of high-profile adventurers will be assisting them, so to a certain extent, they should feel safe.\u201c\u2026 dungeon, huh.\u201dKanata was still lying on his desk, but he, too, was interested in the dungeon.Although he was satisfied with his current career as a streamer, if he had not been able to establish this means of streaming, he might have had a future as an adventurer, using his unlimited magical power as he wished.(\u2026 Well, I\u2019m not really interested.)Uninterested, yet the idea of cheat ability is fascinating enough to imagine.\u201cHey, hey. Let\u2019s form a group if we are free to!\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d\u201cI wonder who the Saint will be teaming up with.\u201d\u201cI want to team up with you!\u201dSo a group formed, but what would really happen to Kanata in isolation\u2026 It almost made me a little sad just to think about it.Alphana, who was the topic of conversation about the group, was surrounded by her classmates and seemed to be having a hard time, but Kanata couldn\u2019t help her, so he left the classroom as it was.\u201c\u2026 Will the badges finally go on sale the day after tomorrow?\u201dThe Haishin-sama badge. It\u2019s finally on the verge of being released.For now, it will only get sold in the Royal Capital, but if it sells well, they plan to supply it to the Empire and the Principality as well.It was complicated to make the badge with that evil f\u00fchrer-like appearance, but as Haishin himself, he was hoping it would sell well.\u201cI\u2019m getting nervous\u2026\u201dWell, with how Maria and Alphana see it, it\u2019d be a blast, but you never know about these things until it happens.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll go home for the day.\u201dAs Kanata walked briskly down the hallway, a group of friendly-looking boys and girls were in front of him.\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d\u201cHow would you like to go to the salon?\u201d\u201cGood. Are you going to treat me?\u201d\u201cYeah, I know a very good one.\u201dThey were two beautiful girls with high levels accompanied by two handsome guys\u2026 As expected, the face standard in this other world is quite high, so much so that Kanata couldn\u2019t help but feel jealous of them.Kanata took his gaze away from them and let out a small sigh, looking at himself objectively with no one around.\u201c\u2026 I need to think of some topics.\u201dKanata was eager to see what kind of mail he would receive today and to spend some time thinking about how he could improve his presentation or what more he could do in the future.To tell the truth, there were plenty of things he\u2019d like to do, but there was one thing he thought might be a little better.\u201cNot that I ever considered myself to have a good voice, but there\u2019s this thing in my mind since Maria and Alphana kept telling me I have a good one.\u201dIt was ASMR, something that was quite famous in his previous life.It literally means Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, and surprisingly, it is not often referred to as such, and few people know about it.More to the point, this world is different, and as a matter of course, the culture of ASMR does not exist, so its pioneering was left in Kanata\u2019s hands.\u201cThat being said, I wonder how much of this can be reproduced with magic power.\u201dThe first question is how to deliver the stimulation with a voice that resonates directly to the brain, and how does it work to achieve a thrilling sensation?There are no headphones, earphones, or dedicated microphones, so it seemed that the only way is to change the wavelength of the magic power used when speaking in various ways.\u201cI can\u2019t do it alone. I have to get someone to help me as an experiment\u2026\u201d[EDN: I have a bad feeling about this.]Maria and Alphana would be happy to help, but since they\u2019ve already left the academy, calling them would be a bit of a hassle.That being the case, Kanata muttered to Mira in a small voice.\u201cYou called?\u201d\u201cGreat, I knew I could count on you, Mira.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ehehe ~\u201dMira appeared without a sound and smiled happily when Kanata praised her.Mira is the ultimate stalker who evolves with each passing day, but these days, he decided to think of her as a dog or a cat.He hadn\u2019t told her why he had called her yet, but when he returned to his room, he finally got to the point.\u201cI\u2019ve decided to take Haishin to a new level.\u201d\u201cO-ooh?\u201d\u201cI want you to be my experiment.\u201d\u201cYou can count on me! I\u2019ll do anything, anything!\u201d\u201cGood, Kanata nodded.\u201dHe activated the terminal and set up a place to stream as usual.\u201cAre you going to stream now?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m only allowing my voice to reach your terminal once.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dMira had no idea what she had to do, of course.\u201cThere\u2019s this thing called ASMR. I\u2019d like to try it once.\u201d\u201cASMR?\u201d\u201cSimply put, it\u2019s an attempt to stimulate the other\u2019s brain with your voice.\u201d\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s hard to say.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Kanata chuckled.After confirming Mira could hear Kanata\u2019s voice through her terminal, he adjusted the magic power he was channelling and checked to see how well she could hear his voice.\u201c\u2026 No change.\u201d\u201cThough it\u2019s very rewarding for me.\u201d\u201cThanks. But it ain\u2019t like this.\u201dBecause he knew Mira would say she liked it, it was important for him to look closely at her reaction as well.Aside from the sight of Mira blushing and sniffling, Kanata shook his head that this kind of reaction was different.\u201cHmnn\u2026 hnn\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 you all right?\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m fine!\u201dShe didn\u2019t seem to be okay at all.Still, he was grateful to Mira, who agreed with cooperating until the end, and he firmly observed Mira\u2019s reaction while changing the wavelength of his magical power\u2026 And then there was a moment when he saw a big change.\u201c!!!?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Oh, here we are.\u201dA thrill shook Mira\u2019s body as if her entire body was shaking.It may have something to do with whether or not you have earphones or headphones, but this is how he found out how the magic flowed.That is, through changing the wavelength of magic, the listener\u2019s perception changes.Since it was his voice, Kanata didn\u2019t feel anything special or even embarrassed on the contrary, but judging from Mira\u2019s reaction, it seemed like he could totally go for it.\u201cW-was it that?\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cI felt a kind of shiver down my back, and it was a bit frightening. I felt like I was going to go crazy if I heard any more!\u201dKanata grinned at her words.\u201cWell done, Mira, that\u2019s how I wanted it to be.\u201dIt may not be complete yet, but Kanata felt a sense of accomplishment that he had established yet another new genre.Of course, it is conceivable that it could be just Mira, so the cooperation of others willing to participate in the experiment is essential, but for now, he decided to see how Mira reacts a little more.\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be used in a relaxed manner, not for something tense.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cMira, I want you to lie down on my bed and put the device to your ear.\u201d\u201cY-yes\u2026\u201dMira did as she was told and lay down on the bed.She laid her body down, facing the wall, and held the terminal close to her ear, letting Kanata know she was ready to go.\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 anything?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dHe would like to thank her for her assistance.\u201cWell then\u2026\u201dMira was embarrassed to tell Kanata, and Kanata decided to mumble the words, saying he understood.Kanata uttered that line, matching the wavelength of the magical power he had just learned.\u201cMira.\u201d\u201c!?!?!?!?\u201dMira\u2019s body trembled.\u201cLive for me from now on. I need you.\u201dAfter saying it out, Kanata also thought, \u2018what the h**l?\u2019 but Mira\u2019s reaction was so much more intense than that.Despite arching her back as if to resist the voice that seems to enter directly into her brain, she fidgets and busily moves her body with a somewhat ecstatic demeanour.\u201cHow was it?\u201d\u201c\u2026 this\u2026 this is\u2026\u201dMira got up with a bright red face.Without trying to hide her somewhat debauched expression, she rubbed her cheek against the terminal and said,\u201cI would love to\u2026 listen to it alone at home. And\u2026 guhehehe \u266a.\u201d\u201c!?\u201dMira started drooling.\u2026 Kanata tilted his head and wondered if it would be okay for him to succeed, but he came to the conclusion that there was still a lot to think about in addition to the room for improvement.\u201cI need to think more about how to showcase, let alone put to practical use.\u201dASMR in the other world, it seems that it will not yet be made public, but if reactions like Mira\u2019s flood the world\u2026 Kanata could not help but feel it would be a scary thing to see.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36: Finally, the first goods on sale!On that day, the front of the castle was very lively.People of all ages, men and women\u2026 No, there were mostly young people and some older people gathered.Some were well dressed, others were not, and it seemed that both nobles and commoners had gathered there equally.\u201cThank you all for coming here,\u201d said a church sister, standing before them.Then, many soldiers lined up with baskets, and seeing them arrive, people cheered as if they had been waiting for them.So what was all the fuss? It was that thing, it got completed, and today was the day it was on sale.\u201cEveryone, please line up in order so that no one gets hurt. Alright? Those who cause unnecessary commotion will get removed, so please understand.\u201dFinally, the Haishin-sama badge showed itself.\u201cOh, this!\u201d\u201cHaishin-sama!\u201d\u201cFather! I want it!\u201d\u201cHold on! I\u2019ll buy enough for the whole family!\u201dAs the excitement in the square grew even more, in the corner, Kanata muttered, \u201cIs this for real?\u201d\u201cIs it really that good? Do you people really want it that much?\u201dHe had half-listened to Maria and Alphana when they said it would definitely sell out, and it seemed they were right.\u201cFufu, this is the power of Haishin-sama,\u201d\u201cYes, as expected.\u201dMaria and Alphana were also close by.With badges on their chests, they looked like girls completely lost to some religious cult.When he took his eyes off them and looked at the square, he saw that the people who had bought were all wearing badges and, in the worst cases, rubbing their cheeks against them. It was an amazing sight.\u201c\u2026\u201dAmong the crowd were high-class courtesans like Kanna and many faces that Kanata recognized from school. He felt a strange mix of emotions about this.But there was no denying that this commotion and sales were definitely due to Haishin\u2019s popularity, and it would definitely serve as motivation for them to continue their activities in the future.\u201cFrom the looks of it, there are people from the Principality and even the Empire.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dMaria was looking at a group of people dressed differently from what you would normally see in the Kingdom.They must be from a different country, and that\u2019s why Maria assumed they were foreigners.They were also waiting patiently in line, and it was a peaceful scene.\u201c\u2026 Well, thank goodness everything seems to be okay?\u201dDuring these festival commotions, anything could happen, but nothing did.With the sisters belonging to the church and soldiers serving in the Capital, the order was in place.\u201c\u2026?\u201dAs he watched the event unfold, Alphana quietly pulled Kanata into the shadows.\u201cAlphana?\u201d\u201cPlease be quiet.\u201dBeing pulled into the shadows by a beautiful girl and being stared at made it hard not to get strange ideas.He felt his heart beating wildly in response to Alphana\u2019s perfect proportions, pretty face, and eyes which were pure yet powerful.\u201cMaria.\u201dA cool voice echoed through the place.The voice sounded somewhat familiar to Kanata, but he remembered its identity when he turned his eyes toward Maria while hiding.\u201cDear Brother?\u201dYes, it was Maria\u2019s elder brother who came.He had the same golden hair and beautiful blue eyes as Maria and was even more handsome than Kanata.He was wearing a plain local costume. However, his face was too perfect, and it couldn\u2019t hide his aura as a royal.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cNothing, I just bought one too.\u201dThe handsome prince, Julius, had a Haishin badge pinned on his chest.\u201cYou wanted one too?\u201d\u201cI am also a follower and a fan of his. Being favoured just because I\u2019m a royal doesn\u2019t suit me.\u201dJulius laughed as he said this and began to engage Maria in conversation.Incidentally, Maria also noticed that Alphana had hidden Kanata when Julius approached, as she gave off a vibe that seemed to say not to interfere with Julius.\u201cOh yeah, that time was just a self-introduction.\u201d\u201cDo you want to talk to him now?\u201d\u201cNo, let\u2019s just leave it\u2026 I\u2019m not Haishin at this moment.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dAlthough he had recently been greeting others as Haishin, it was becoming a problem. Without the mask and the black clothes, Kanata was just a commoner, and if he greeted Julius casually, he would be looked at strangely. If he was not careful, he might even get charged with l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9.\u201cWell, I suppose not.\u201dKanata laughed, wondering if that was possible since he was also Maria\u2019s brother.\u201cBut then again, that\u2019s the prestige of Haishin-sama.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cFather and Mother asked me to buy three of each, and I made sure to get them.\u201d\u201cThree, but why?\u201d\u201cOne to wear, one for preservation, and one for display, they said.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dIt seemed that not even the King and Queen could resist the allure of Haishin.He wanted to say that it was not right for the highest power in the country to do this, but if they were buying merchandise, he can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201cKanata-sama\u2019s prestige is truly amazing. I respect you even more.\u201d\u201cStop it, Alphana. Don\u2019t talk about respect for such things.\u201dAt that moment, Kanata relaxed a little too much and accidentally kicked a bucket nearby.\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dOf course, Julius noticed the sound.As Kanata was wondering what to do, the commotion in the square became even louder, and angry shouts could be heard.Not only Kanata and Alphana but also Maria and Julius turned their attention in that direction.Apparently, there was a side-taking and an interruption, and they were angry about it.\u201cBrother, since you\u2019re here, why don\u2019t you go stop them?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Aren\u2019t you cold to me lately?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201c\u2026 You used to chase after me calling me big brother all the time.\u201dWith a bit of melancholy, Julius ran off toward the commotion.As for Kanata, he got saved by the people who made a commotion, and although it was strange to thank them, he muttered \u2018good job\u2019 in his heart.\u201cThat was close. I mean, it\u2019s not like anything would happen if we got found, but still.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dIt would probably just be him asking who we are, and that\u2019ll be the end of it, but better safe than sorry.Kanata then watched in the shadows until the badges ran out, and finally, all the badges produced this time around got sold out without incident.It seems they plan on launching more Haishin merchandise, and Maria and Alphana will lead the discussion.\u201cYeah, these two are really big sponsors of mine.\u201dBeing the Princess and Saint, their presence was enormous.For now, they were still staying within the Kingdom, but if they could later expand to the Empire and the Principality in various ways, it could be a further leap forward.\u201c\u2026 Well, as for me, I just want to be able to stream freely.\u201dUltimately, that was where the roots of Kanata\u2019s passion lay.He was satisfied just being able to talk and do whatever he wanted.\u201cWell, I do want to become big, though\u2026\u201d\u2018Becoming big and returning home\u2019 was what he told his family when he left the village.Even now, Kanata was definitely a huge presence, but he was not done yet.He clenched his fist and renewed his determination.\u201cSpeaking of which, Kanata-sama\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cActually, I saw Mira this morning. What did you do to her?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, it must be because of ASMR.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Heh, what is that?\u201dHe had yet to tell Alphana about the ASMR.Although he properly recorded the results of the experiments with Mira, he was still short on samples, so Alphana agreed to cooperate.\u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d\u201cMaria, you should come too.\u201dAnd since Maria had also returned, it\u2019d be great to get her cooperation.Not knowing what was going on, she went to the church with them, and Alphana made arrangements to ensure that no one entered the room.\u201cSo it\u2019s ASMR\u2026 right? That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\u201cYeah, for now, just relax, both of you.\u201dBoth of them sat on chairs and took relaxed positions as Kanata instructed.Then, Kanata placed the devices close to their ears and adjusted the magic wavelength just like he did with Mira.After several minutes passed, Kanata heard from both of them that it was amazing and not something that could be expressed in words.He left the church with happiness in his heart.\u201c\u2026 Haan!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Not good.\u201dAs soon as Kanata left the room, they both sat down on the ground without hesitation, not caring if they got dirty.Their faces turned red, and they stood dazed for a while, but as they started to recover, Alphana whispered.\u201cMaria\u2026 thought I could have a child with just his voice.\u201dMaria shook her head vigorously in response.However, a common understanding formed between Maria and Alphana about if it would be appropriate to release this ASMR genre to the world.\u201c\u2026 This will drive anyone crazy, for sure.\u201d\u201cAgreed. As a saint, I have resistance against all mental attacks, but if I listen to this alone in my room, I don\u2019t know how long I can resist myself.\u201dIt was a wonderful, very wonderful thing.But at the same time, they realized that it could also be something terrible.They were already captivated by the ASMR, and their minds were spinning, but they felt a sense of crisis for humanity, and for a moment, they returned to normal.They wondered if it was appropriate to release this to the world, but at the same time, the desire to listen to it alone in a room and do all sorts of things overflowed\u2026 It seems they\u2019re gonna have a very troublesome night tonight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37: Problems that keep arising one after anotherThe fact that the Haishin\u2019s, played by Kanata, badge sold like hotcakes went around the world.Tourists who had come all the way from other countries just to buy the badge showed it back home or gave it as a gift.While the world was in the midst of a Haishin fever, an unusual man was staying in the village of Roggin, Kanata\u2019s hometown.\u201c\u2026 What a pain.\u201dThe man, who was wearing clothes resembling tattered rags, muttered.Even though the rugged road was made passable to some extent with the help of Saint, it was still a mountainous area, so the number of people coming and going was still small.That\u2019s why even with his suspicious looks he got welcomed as a guest.However, since the people living in the village were naturally ordinary and powerless, no one noticed this man\u2019s true identity.\u201cTonight\u2026 My magic power will recover, kukuku.\u201dThe man muttered as he watched the torrent of magic leaking out of his palm.He was not a human but a man of the demon tribe and one of the rebels who fled from the undergoing purges in the Demon Kingdom.He had exhausted most of his magic power when he fled from there, and now he was waiting for recovery by hiding in this village.\u201cHow are you doing?\u201dKanata\u2019s mother, Meza, asked him, not knowing he was a demon.Not just Meza but all the other villagers took care of him, thinking that something might have happened to him. They have arranged various things to make him feel comfortable.\u201cI\u2019m good now. This village is very kind, and I am happy to have drifted here.\u201d(Watch me now. I\u2019m going to kill every single one of you tonight and suck up all your magic.)Unlike his appearance, which gives the impression of a calm man, he looks down on most humans in his innermost thoughts as if they are like trash.He understood that his pursuers were very close, as the Demon King had given instructions to find him, and he had no time to lose.(I won\u2019t end up here, I\u2019m not such a weakling!!)He snarled at Meza, who had turned her back on him.Meza, her husband and the other villagers had no idea of the tragedy that would come later.This, of course, was also true for their precious son, Kanata.Meza and her husband are always thinking more about their son than themselves, wondering what Kanata is doing now and whether he fits in well at the school.\u201c\u2026 hmm?\u201dThinking about something else, the man who harbours such a cruel purpose had something on his mind.A few days ago, he saw a woman staying in the village like him, wearing a robe, but\u2026 this woman looked suspicious even to him.Being a demon, he can tell the amount of magic a being has by looking at them, but that woman had no magic power to an unnatural degree\u2014 it was truly zero.\u201cThat was creepy as h**l\u2026 Well, not my business. I\u2019ll eat all the magic, even if it\u2019s just the size of a feather.\u201dSo time passed, and night came.The man, who enjoyed the food brought as if it were his last meal, showed his true identity in the center of the village.With his somewhat recovered magic power overflowing, the wings on his back and the horns on his head were undeniable proof that he was a demon, and the villagers screamed in horror.\u201cY-you, so you were\u2026!\u201d\u201cKukuku, you humans are really fools. But I\u2019ll have to praise you because soon you\u2019re going to become my food. Hahahaha!\u201dThe man was thinking of eating everything in this village so he could return to the demon land to unite the rebels and start all over again.As he looked at the villagers running away, the first person he noticed was Meza, who bravely protected the children.(\u2026 This woman, not so much for her magical power, but for her quality, looks very tasty. Let\u2019s eat her first.)The man flapped his wings and landed in front of Meza.Meza\u2019s husband tried to protect her by punching the man, but the man easily avoided it and was about to stab him with his sharp claws.\u201cYare-yare! The village is the most precious place for us demons to protect. And yet, you dare to get your hands on the most VIP person\u2026 How foolish. Truly foolish.\u201dSomeone spoke in a very husky tone.Something flew between the man and Meza, cutting through the wind, and the man suddenly turned his head to see what it was.There was a woman there. It was the same woman who he saw wearing a robe.\u201cYou\u2026? No, you can\u2019t be\u2026\u201dAs she used her magic, he noticed that she had magical power.The woman smiled slyly, took off the hood that covered her head and revealed a face of an enchanting beauty.\u201cWhat the h**l is a succubus doing here?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to mention I\u2019m a succubus. Because this is where that man\u2019s family lives.\u201d\u201cWhat the h**l are you talking about?\u201dOf course, not only did the demon not understand this situation, but also Meza and the other villagers.However, the succubus being an obstacle to the man, he changed his target to the succubus and tried to attack her\u2026 but he got impaled on the ground.\u201c\u2026 Gah?\u201dThe man was confused about why he was sinking into the ground and couldn\u2019t move.When he looked up, though crawling desperately with his arms and legs, he saw both the absolute existence and despair in the Demon Kingdom.\u201cIt would have been better if you had left the village without doing anything. Are you ready for the consequences?\u201d\u201cArgh\u2026 argh\u2026\u201dIt was the Demon King, the absolute ruler he once worshiped, coldly looking down on him.She held out the palm of her hand, and something like a black sphere enveloped his whole body\u2026 When the sphere became so small that it disappeared, the man vanished without a trace along it.\u201cIt\u2019s done. Lucia, what about the rest?\u201d\u201cNo response. I think this is the last.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dShrouza\u2026 the Demon King turned to the villagers.Of course, the Demon King\u2019s face was hidden, and the villagers were looking at her in dismay.\u201c\u2026 Haishin-sama?\u201dIt was then that a relatively young voice called out.Even though the village was in such a remote area, and there was only one terminal, it did not mean that there were no people who did not travel to the royal capital, so a few of them were aware of this trend.That\u2019s why someone noticed that the Demon King\u2019s mask was the same as Haishin\u2019s.\u201cIndeed. I am the Demon King and a fan of Haishin. I cannot say exactly why I am here, but the man from before is a result of my misconduct\u2026 I was keeping watch to protect you all.\u201dThe capacity of the villagers\u2019 heads was on the verge of exploding because the Demon King was looking to protect humans, and the Demon King was a fan of Haishin.\u201cI hear that this Haishin thing is pretty famous these days.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026 you don\u2019t know Haishin?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not really interested, and neither is my husband.\u201dThe Demon King and the succubus called Lucia also rolled their eyes at Meza\u2019s words.Being the Demon King, she naturally knows the relationship between Meza and Kanata, but she didn\u2019t know how to react to how neither his mother nor his father is particularly interested in him.\u201c\u2026 but that\u2019s good for Kanata,\u201d someone whispered, but no one heard.If he were to see his own parents worshiping Haishin-sama, he would surely be overwhelmed with mixed emotions.\u201c\u2026 I will make you understand.\u201d\u201cHaah?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll let you know! The splendour of Haishin!\u201d\u201cWonderful idea, Lord Demon King!\u201d\u201cStop! You shouldn\u2019t do that!\u201dSomeone shouted so, but no one heard that.******\u201c\u2026 Akchoo!!!\u201dDuring the live streaming, Kanata could not help but sneeze.Kanata thought that either someone was gossiping about him or he caught a cold\u2026 Well, it was probably the former.: Is it a cold?: Are you okay?: Sneezing\u2026 Haishin-sama is sneezing!: I want to receive all of it.: Sneezing is good\u2026 Can anyone help me sneeze?Kanata wanted to mockingly ask what\u2019s so good about sneezing.Even though they were talking like that, Kanata was extremely curious about what happened at the academy today.That was because of Maria and Alphana\u2019s strange behaviour.\u201cDon\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll be back to normal tomorrow!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine! See you tomorrow!\u201dKanata never thought that it was because of that ASMR.Rather, Kanata didn\u2019t notice the important thing.\u201c\u2026 Hmm.\u201dKanata was altering the wavelength of his magic power to reach the brain the most easily, making the voice better to experience and stimulate the brain.Unlike ASMR, which was tuned by adjusting the devices in his previous life, Kanata had not yet realized what would happen if it got amplified by magic power, which can be almost anything, and what happens when it prompts stimulation\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38: Do you know the word \u2018Yorishiro\u2019?In his previous life, the term \u2018troublesome followers\u2019 existed.These are followers who admire their idols, but to an extreme degree which causes them to repeatedly engage in actions that are close to going out of control.In most cases, they were labelled as \u2018bad guys\u2019 and often made fun of, but from their own perspective, those feelings were undoubtedly genuine.\u201cHehehe, I finally got the Haishin-sama badge!\u201dShe was a girl one could find anywhere.She was carrying the Haishin-sama badge sold in the capital city, and she was thinking of buying any merchandise related to him as soon as it was available.\u201cI made a contribution to Haishin-sama today! It\u2019d be not wrong to say that this life of mine is devoted to him, and I will continue to invest more and more to support him!\u201dThe girl was giving off a slightly dangerous vibe.It\u2019s not that she\u2019d commit a crime or anything like that, nor it\u2019s wrong to think that by buying her own Haishin merchandise, she\u2019s investing in him and able to support him.\u201cHey, although you\u2019re giving so much as a donation already, what would you do if Haishin-sama found a girlfriend?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah?\u201dA friend asked her what she would do if her beloved, Haishin-sama, had a girlfriend.Haishin is a human being, and he will definitely have a girlfriend, start a family, have children, and live happily ever after, the friend said.She heard that, but\u2026 there was no way in the world she would accept it.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Haishin-sama is our\u2026 mine alone. Even though I think about him so much, there\u2019s no way he could have a lover. It\u2019s impossible, absolutely impossible.\u201dShe had supported him ever since she became a fan and even bought his merchandise. She was prepared to offer him more in the future and had that kind of determination, and that\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t even think of him having a girlfriend even as a joke.Being a hardcore fan can sometimes make you a troublesome follower. Even now, there are quite a few troublesome people around Kanata, but it is true that there are many girls like her who are obsessed with him beyond the point of love.Because he was an idol-like figure they would never meet, these women think of him as if he were a sacred being.******\u201cYou will form a group of four from here.\u201dKanata and the other S-class members were in front of a temple-like structure a short distance from the royal capital.Today was finally the day they would enter the dungeon like they were told.The gate that welcomed them was truly a nest of demons. The commoner students who were with Kanata were trembling with fear.\u201cI-is it going to be alright\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be alright\u2026 probably.\u201d\u201cBesides, there are also adventurers\u2026 right?\u201dAs the teacher said, there were some adventurers who were willing to help this time.Each one of them seemed like a relatively high-rank adventurer. There were some with a charismatic atmosphere and some without.It seemed that there would be a hit or miss.Kanata sighed.\u201cKanata-sama, shall we go together?\u201dIt was also Alphana who approached Kanata, who was wondering who to go with.Alphana stood by Kanata\u2019s side, ignoring everyone around her, who looked at her and wondered why she was there.Apparently, she wanted to be with Kanata, which Kanata understood very well.\u201c\u2026 Thank you, Alphana.\u201d\u201c\u2026 No, it\u2019s because I wanted to do it.\u201dAfter all, Alphana is a kind and wonderful woman\u2014Kanata praised her in his heart.Since they had to make a group of four, they would have needed two more, but since their team is a combination of Alphana, a saint, and Kanata, someone greatly valued by the teachers, it was decided that just the two were sufficient.\u201cThen it\u2019s just the two of us \u266a.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata\u2019s heart beat heavily as he slightly blushed and averted her gaze while Alphana spoke to him that way.Even though they have been friends for a long time, he couldn\u2019t help but feel something when he saw her beautiful smile. Kanata tried to hide the fact that his face was getting hot.\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll watch you guys then.\u201dOf course, the two of them together represent trust, but an intruder, an adventurer, would follow along.The man who appeared before Kanata and Alphana was quite flamboyant, and the adventurer rank badge on his badge was silver\u2026 In other words, B-rank.The rank system also exists for adventurers, and since there are only A- and S-ranks above B, it is no wonder they are quite highly valued.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you too.\u201dAside from Kanata, Alphana also seemed completely uninterested, and her voice contained no inflection whatsoever.Since this adventurer had just talked to the teacher, she would be treated with a proper understanding that Alphana was a saint\u2026 or so he thought.\u201cYou\u2019re cute, Alphana-chan. What are your hobbies?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata sighed, thinking, \u201cSo he\u2019s the type of person to do this right after entering the dungeon.\u201dSince the purpose of the training was basically to go inside and fight demonic beasts, excessive contact from adventurers was supposed to be forbidden. Yet he treated Kanata as non-existent and only cared about Alphana.\u201cIsn\u2019t it hard, being a saint and all? Is there anything I can do to help?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWell, Alphana did not respond at all and was so thorough that it seemed as if she was not even aware of his existence, let alone his interest.(\u2026 This guy seems to be wearing a lot of masks.)That was something that Kanata sensed intuitively.Somehow\u2026 It was just a feeling, but Kanata felt that the adventurer had a vibe of someone who pretends to be a good person and uses women for his own benefit, like a player he had seen in his past life.\u201cI\u2019m the party leader, and I\u2019m in trouble every day because people depend on me. But as a leader, I\u2015\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAlphana seemed to be erasing his existence from her mind without a thought.It was obvious. But even if the other person was a famous adventurer, Kanata had no intention of standing by and doing nothing.He positioned himself to shield Alphana from the man and lined up firmly next to her.\u201cKanata-sama \u266a.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ou.\u201dHer composition changed from the blank expression of earlier to smiling, and the adventurer\u2019s expression changed to one of being bothered.This guy\u2026 named Chilian, an adventurer, finally said to Kanata.\u201cHey, hey, I\u2019m talking to her right now.\u201d\u2018So get out of the way,\u2019 he said.Kanata let out an understandable sigh at Chilian\u2019s actions and replied as he would to a child in trouble.\u201cWeren\u2019t you told that excessive contact with students is prohibited?\u201d\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata sighed even more heavily, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dApparently, even though he was a renowned adventurer, when he was in the presence of a good woman, his true nature\u2026 No, he guessed this man was like that in the first place.While he had his back to Alphana, a wolf-type monster jumped out on her out of nowhere.Before Alphana could even raise her hand, Kanata quickly activated a low-grade magic spell, Fire, and shot it toward the monster.There was a suitably loud sound on impact, and the magical beast evaporated without a scream.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Alphana.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEven with lower-grade magic, the power released by a person with infinite magical power was tremendous, and Chilian stared at the place where the magical beast had been, stunned.As they went further inside, it got darker, and naturally, Kanata put his hand on Alphana\u2019s shoulder.\u201c\u2026 Ah.\u201dThat might be an unnecessary concern, but it was an action taken because he wanted to protect Alphana.Thinking it\u2019s bad manners to touch a woman\u2019s body without permission, Kanata quickly removed his hand.\u201cKanata-sama, please keep it that way.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Are you okay with it?\u201d\u201cYes. It makes me feel very safe.\u201dApparently, it was all right.He placed his hand on Alphana\u2019s shoulder, and they continued to move forward together\u2026 but it seemed that Chilian was bothered by this.When they came out to a slightly wider space, Kanata was pushed from behind by Chilian.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cKanata-sama!\u201dA trap got activated as Kanata got thrown out alone.Numerous beings called skeletons with bone bodies appeared from the ground and tried to surround Kanata.But at this point, an even more mysterious phenomenon occurred.\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d\u201cAra?\u201dBefore they knew it, Kanata was back by Alphana\u2019s side.And conversely, Chilian was thrown in Kanata\u2019s place.\u201cW-what the h**l is happening?!\u201dThen, of course, the skeletons\u2019 target shifted to Chilian.He fought back, pulling out the sword from his waist, but he got outnumbered overwhelmingly by the skeletons and couldn\u2019t handle them at all.Although his action was unforgivable, Kanata couldn\u2019t just overlook it.\u201c\u2026 Why?\u201dJust as Kanata unleashed his magic on the skeleton horde, Alphana muttered behind him.\u201c\u2026 Kanata, why are you protecting the trash that tried to kill you?\u201dOf course, Kanata could not hear that whisper.Alphana, who had a completely different atmosphere than before, whispered something that Kanata couldn\u2019t understand and then returned to her usual self, helping Kanata.Earlier, Alphana\u2019s eyes were glowing light blue, just like the goddess Kanata had met before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39: A true SaintThe dungeon exploration, which was part of the class, somehow turned out to be uneventful.Of course, after being attacked by the skeletons and being instilled with fear, Chilian became much more docile.Nevertheless, trying to set Kanata up in a trap was a serious crime, and Chilian received stern judgment after Alphana explained the situation to the teachers.\u201cIf something had happened to Kanata-sama, I wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive myself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dIt was nothing for Kanata to apologize for, but he apologized frankly because she was still worried about him.The teacher also apologized for having arranged for an adventurer like Chilian, but Kanata, on the contrary, felt more apologetic when they apologized too much.\u201cWell, I was fine, so it\u2019s okay. Besides\u2026\u201dEven if that mysterious phenomenon had not occurred, Kanata would have definitely been able to deal with it.There were indeed many skeletons, and even with low-grade magic, he could\u2019ve easily dealt with them by repeatedly unleashing it in all directions.\u201cHaving infinite magical power is great, isn\u2019t it? As a saint, I have a lot of magical power, but I still can\u2019t even come close to yours.\u201dIn this world, everyone other than Kanata had limited magical power.Therefore, it was meaningless to compare limited magical power with inexhaustible one, but from Alphana\u2019s point of view, the infinite seems to be a word of wonder.\u201cWell, it\u2019s helping me to livestream. So I appreciate it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to ask why such power exists. I just\u2026\u201dAlphana, who was sitting next to him, took his hand.\u201cAs long as Kanata-sama is happy, that\u2019s all I need.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Alphana.\u201dShe continued to speak further.With a saint\u2019s love in her eyes, she gently rubbed Kanata\u2019s hand.\u201cI learned about Haishin-sama, and then I got to know Kanata-sama. I think it\u2019s unavoidable to overlap the two of you even if I didn\u2019t intend to, and I sometimes wonder whether this is a good thing or not.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cIndeed Kanata-sama and Haishin-sama are the same beings, but Kanata-sama in front of me now is Kanata-sama himself, a nobody. I think it\u2019s wrong to superimpose Haishin-sama on you and treat you in such a way.\u201dKanata and Haishin are indeed one and the same, but it\u2019s Haishin who became a big name in the world.That\u2019s why, even if Kanata is honoured by that, it seems that Alphana thinks it\u2019s not right for the people around him to think of Kanata only as Haishin.\u201cI think Kanata-sama will probably become an even bigger presence. However, it is an unchangeable fact that it will only be as Haishin-sama.\u201d\u201cYeah, right.\u201dKanata nodded in agreement.After all, as a streamer, he knew that it would happen, and it was not bad for him to become famous as Haishin and not as Kanata.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m just one of your fans, but at the same time, I am also fortunate to be treated as a friend by Kanata-sama. So I\u2026 that.\u201dAlphana\u2019s wording was unusual.She thought for a while as if in distress and then continued, as she had found the right words to say.\u201cAs someone who knows Kanata-sama\u2019s secrets, I want to be the kind of person who you can ask for advice when you\u2019re in trouble and lend you a hand\u2026 whenever something is wrong. I want to be the kind of person who can stay close to Kanata-sama, not just Haishin-sama.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe was seriously kind.Since coming to this world, he has met many people, and there were some who have become support for him, including his family.But, thinking back, perhaps no one has been as considerate as her while knowing about Haishin.\u201c\u2026 Fufu, I did say it a little like that, though. I think it\u2019s the same for Maria, Mira and the others.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 I guess so.\u201dNot only Alphana but also Maria and her family have been supportive of Kanata.They were truly great personalities from Kanata\u2019s point of view, even if he had been feeling a bit of a glimpse of horror lately, if only in his mind.\u201cYou\u2019ve also created a support group, right? I think it would be nice to give you guys some sort of a thank-you or membership benefit. \u201c\u201cWell!\u201dBy making various improvements to the streaming, it may also be possible to stream content exclusive to members.Unfortunately, this feature is not available yet, but the fan club launched by Alphana and Maria corresponds to that.\u201cIf it is the case then\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm!\u201dWith a clap of her hands, Alphana made this suggestion.\u201cRegarding the ASMR that you let me listen to before, how about making it exclusive for members and letting them listen to it?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dIndeed.He still doesn\u2019t intend to release ASMR content to the world, but it may be possible to release it as a test exclusive to members.\u201cAlright, I got it. I\u2019ll consider it in that direction.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHeartily, Alphana\u2019s nostrils seemed to have widened.However, ASMR is basically a bunch of mouth-watering lines, so it\u2019s a little embarrassing to think about which lines will appeal to women.So, he decided to ask what words would be good for different situations.\u201cT-then!\u201d\u201cOh calm down, Alphana!\u201dTrying to stop Alphana from leaning all the way over to him, he touched her body with both hands, and his hands got buried in Alphana\u2019s ample chest, like a protagonist from some manga.Kanata quickly withdrew his hand and apologized, but Alphana laughed softly and said she did not mind.\u201c\u2026 Alphana, you\u2019re too kind.\u201d\u201cA little bit of it was on purpose, but if it\u2019s Kanata-sama, then\u2026 cough! Well, it\u2019s my mistake, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. Besides, I\u2019m not the kind of person who would get angry over something like that \u266a.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Oh.\u201d\u201c\u2026. Alphana is too kind, just like a saint,\u201d Kanata thought, impressed by her words.Later, he asked Alphana for a reference about what kind of words would be good and made it the content for ASMR.\u201c\u2026 Kufufu, I will not miss the opportunity to earn some points.\u201dIt was unclear who said that, but it didn\u2019t feel malicious. The way Alphana thought of herself and Kanata\u2019s needs at the same time, though her behaviour can sometimes be scary, is still a reliable presence.*****And then a few days passed.Maria and Alphana, as well as Mira, experienced ASMR, but when it came to actually creating it, he did not want to compromise, so Kanata worked hard by taking a little time.\u201c\u2026 I ain\u2019t this kind of character.\u201dAlphana\u2019s request was for some self-satisfying character, one that seemed to say, \u201cYou are mine,\u201d in an arrogant, irreverent manner.As for Kanata, with memories of his past life, he didn\u2019t particularly struggle, but to push things to the limit, he listened to his own voice as confirmation to find out the ultimate was beyond painful.His heart was screaming.\u201c\u2026 Haah.\u201dHowever, the thought that there were people waiting for him motivated him.In the meantime, the days passed with only Alphana knowing this surprise.\u201cNext week, Princess Maria will travel to the Principality of Xandard for a diplomatic meeting. An escort from the castle will accompany her, but it is a possibility that someone from the academy will join her. Probably, it\u2019ll be someone from the SSS class. I\u2019m letting you know just in case.\u201dSo the teacher informed them.Kanata was still propped up on his desk listening to the conversation, but the Principality of Xandard is a country Kanata has no shortage of topics to talk about.It is a country where some aristocrats have been threatening Kanata that they will not forgive him, as in the letter to Kanata asking for his help.\u201c\u2026 Well, I guess it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201dSo Kanata thought\u2026\u201cHey Kanata, I\u2019m supposed to be heading to the Principality next week.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you\u2026 would you like to come along with us?\u201dSo he got a proposal directly from Maria.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: That badge is a precious relic\u201cPrincipality\u2026 I haven\u2019t been there in a long time.\u201d\u201cReally? I mean, this is my first time going there.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe I get to travel with Maria-sama like this!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited, alright?\u201dHearing his classmates\u2019 voices from far away, Kanata crossed his arms. He muttered in his mind that they were too noisy.The other day, Maria suddenly, but unexpectedly, asked if he would like to come with her to the Principality, to which Kanata nodded readily.The Principality of Xandard is a technologically advanced country in the field of magic engineering. He wanted to find something useful when streaming and the experience of visiting a country he had never been to before.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s too much fun, but\u2026 it\u2019s basically like a trip for the rest of the class.\u201d\u201cYou think so?\u201d\u201cYes. You\u2019ll know it when we get there.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I guess so.\u201dThis time, it\u2019s just a regular diplomatic meeting led by Maria, but there is also the aspect of gaining various experiences by visiting other countries.Only a few of the students got selected to go on this trip. Some got recommended by their teachers, and others were approached personally by Maria, including Kanata.\u201c\u2026 Um.\u201d\u201cIs something wrong?\u201dAt that moment, Maria\u2019s face fell somewhat apologetically.When Kanata asked what was wrong, Maria spoke up in a small voice.\u201cYou always do your stream at night, don\u2019t you, Kanata-kun? Even though you have your terminal, I think there might be some awkward or inconvenient moments in the Principality. So, you need to be careful.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s what you meant.\u201dA change in environment from the usual will probably impact his stream.Well, he couldn\u2019t promise the same kind of content as always, but he had already told his followers that he could be absent for a few days, so it\u2019s not something Maria has to worry about.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. To be honest, I was thinking of taking a break once in a while since I have been streaming for so long.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is this true?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dEven so, Maria still seems not quite convinced.Kanata wished she would not worry about it. If it bothered him, he would not have accepted her invitation.As he said, he\u2019s not going to let this opportunity to go to a country he might not visit again go to waste. It\u2019s a great opportunity for him.\u201cThank you, Maria, for giving me the opportunity to go to the Principality.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cKukuh, don\u2019t make that face. You\u2019re a princess. Be confident and say\u2014 act like my servant.\u201d\u201cYou know I can\u2019t say that!\u201dFinally, Maria\u2019s voice became louder as she regained her composure.Kanata chuckled at the sight and looked out the window again.\u201c\u2026 Quite a comfortable sky journey, huh.\u201dHe thought they were travelling by carriage or something, but they were flying by using summon magic to summon wyverns.They were all carried by five wyverns.It\u2019s hard to describe the feeling, but in Kanata\u2019s memory, it\u2019s similar to being carried by a bus-like vehicle.\u201c\u2026 Thank you too, Kanata-kun.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dAs he was looking out the window, Maria muttered.\u201cIn truth, the reason I invited you is that I personally wanted to.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata\u2019s heart raced, trying to act like it was no big deal.He turned his gaze towards Maria while trying to hide his feelings, to her staring at him intently.\u201cEver since I got to know you and after spending time with Alphana, your presence in my mind has grown a lot. Maybe it\u2019s because I hear your voice in the form of the podcast, but it feels more familiar.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ou.\u201d\u201cEveryone treats me as a princess, but you\u2019re different. When I told you I didn\u2019t want polite words, you did so, and you always correct me when I\u2019m wrong, just like you do with Alphana.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah.\u201dKanata realized he was not being too reserved with her or with Alphana. He treated them as close friends, which is unusual for someone of their status.\u201cIt\u2019s really refreshing, you see. I think this is what it feels like to have an equal friendship.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 Yeah.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really happy to be in a place where I have Kanata-kun, Alphana, and now I\u2019m even in a place where I can support\u2026 Haishin-sama.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMaria spoke directly, with honesty.Compared to Alphana, Maria is strong-willed and can be impulsive, but hearing her say that she\u2019s happy because of their presence also makes Kanata happy.\u201cSo I\u2019d like to continue to help you. How about that?\u201d\u201cAs much as I appreciate it, Maria\u2019s got a lot going on as a princess, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cUn~\u201dMaria put her hand on her chin and thought, then continued as if it were a matter of course.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more important than you, Kanata-kun. And\u2026 Everyone in my family knows I\u2019m putting my all into supporting Haishin-sama.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Oh, that\u2019s what you meant.\u201dIt was embarrassing, but Kanata, who had once met the king and queen as Haishin, was very much convinced by those words.\u201c\u2026 Is that good enough for you?\u201d\u201cYes. I think it\u2019s good\u2026 Haha, more than good it\u2019s the best for me. After all, I want to be someone who can help you.\u201dKanata nodded, feeling slightly pressured.Maria, who had raised the tension to a cackling level, giggled even more and closed the distance to Kanata, who sat next to her.Shoulder to shoulder, the sweet scent emanating from Maria tickled his nostrils.Kanata continued to think about how women could have such a sweet and good smell to ease his tension.\u201cAnd yet Alphana was disappointed.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dRegarding this matter, Alphana wasn\u2019t able to come along.It\u2019s also significant to know that this diplomatic meeting doesn\u2019t require her as a saint, but it would be difficult to take her out even if it did.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 Then, Kanata-sama!\u201d\u2026 This is something Maria doesn\u2019t know, but in order to make up for the loneliness, he got asked to leave some words directed towards Alphana, so he used the recording function of the terminal to do so.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, nothing\u2026\u201dKanata was slightly regretting it now that he had uttered such embarrassing lines meant only for Alphana, unlike the one he was trying to produce as a members-only item.After that, the journey through the sky ended as he conversed with the students who had accompanied him, including Maria.While travelling on the ground in a carriage takes much longer, the advantage of flying is still its speed.\u201c\u2026 This is it.\u201d\u201cYes, this is the capital of Xandard.\u201dThus, they arrived at the country of Xandard, known for its advanced magical technology.Unlike the capital city, which gives off a slightly old-fashioned image, the streets give off a somewhat modern impression, and not just Kanata but others were also amazed by this.Soon after, they were greeted by a girl who had brought guards along,\u201cGood day, everyone. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you, Princess Maria.\u201d\u201cLong time no see, Athena\u2026 Well, why don\u2019t we just go on as usual?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. Let\u2019s do that?\u201dThe girl, seemingly an acquaintance of Maria, took out a fan from her pocket and opened it with a sound.\u201cMy name is Athena Fartoa, the Duke\u2019s daughter. Pleased to make you my acquaintance.\u201dThe words used to describe people of high status in the Kingdom, Empire, and Principality are not likely to vary too much. Unfortunately, Kanata did not have much knowledge in such areas.However, he understands that a Duke is quite\u2026 No, the highest-ranking nobility among the nobility.\u201c\u2026\u201dAside from Maria, Kanata and the others just bowed their heads quietly.Athena chuckled softly, apparently thinking this might have led to unnecessary reticence.\u201cPlease don\u2019t feel too nervous. My position here is certainly significant, but I don\u2019t intend to make you, who have come from the Kingdom, worry about it.\u201dSomeone exhaled in relief at her words.Well. There probably won\u2019t be any unfair treatment, and most importantly, there is a feeling of safety when Maria is by their side.\u201c\u2026 Athena, is that\u2026\u201d\u201cEh? Ah, this?\u201dIt was then that Maria noticed something.Athena smiled as she traced the object attached to Maria\u2019s gaze, the tip of her finger.\u201cIt\u2019s Master Haishin\u2019s badge! You sent your servants to buy it!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata had a distant look on his face.However, Kanata did not anticipate this at all.He never imagined that he would make friends of the same s*x here, away from his country.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Here comes the fanatic\u201cFufu, Maria, you\u2019re very unusual. Usually, only the princess\u2019s guards or attendants are brought along on such occasions.\u201d\u201cWell, yeah. But I thought it\u2019d be a good opportunity for students who don\u2019t usually go outside the Kingdom to have various experiences.\u201d\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right\u2026 Hmm.\u201dWhile Maria and Athena were happily chatting with each other, Kanata and the others were quietly walking behind them.The duo of a princess and a lady of the duchy, it is needless to say who was in a higher position, but Athena also had a grace that did not lose to Maria\u2019s.\u201c\u2026 Athena-sama, the Duke\u2019s daughter, is really beautiful.\u201dThe guy walking next to Kanata muttered that.Kanata did not respond to his mutter, but from Kanata\u2019s point of view, Athena was certainly a beautiful girl, so he secretly nodded.(The beauty standard of this world is simply too high.)Kanata smiled bitterly, thinking how many times he had thought about this.Incidentally, besides Maria and Athena, all of Kanata\u2019s classmates who accompanied them on this trip were also handsome guys and pretty girls.Kanata was by no means ugly, but he was only average, so he had a subtle feeling.\u201cMaria, you\u2019ve come with me, but what about the rest?\u201d\u201cNo need to worry. I\u2019ll give them instructions.\u201dMaria returned to where Kanata and the others were.\u201cAs I had originally informed you, I will head to the castle with Athena. You are relatively free, but you must definitely return here by evening.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201cGot it!\u201dKanata questioned if it really was okay to have that much freedom, but if Maria said so, it should be fine.They were not here just to have fun, as they had to write a report on what they did on this tour.\u201c\u2026 Well. I guess I\u2019ll just have to look around then.\u201dHis classmates had already gone off together in groups, leaving Kanata feeling somewhat left out, but he decided to take a step forward anyway.However, as he was about to leave, Maria, who had been seeing them off, approached him.\u201cI\u2019ll miss you, Kanata-kun, but I\u2019ll see you in the evening.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dSmiling, she walked away with Athena.Athena turned back and looked at Kanata with interest but seemed not to have any particular concern and walked away.Kanata continued to watch their backs for a while, muttering that it was time to go, and finally, he also went outside.\u201cWell, where should I go first?\u201dWell, it is whatever it is. Even though he was going to be wandering alone, Kanata was excited.He only knew the scenery of his hometown and the royal city, so it was refreshing to walk around the streets of a different country like this.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the artisan district first!\u201dThe development of magical equipment is said to have led to a district called the artisan district, where many skilled craftsmen do business, so he decided to head there first.Kanata had no idea where it was as this was his first time.However, he didn\u2019t get abandoned by the heavens because of his good conduct on a daily basis.\u201cIs there something I can help you with?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dIt was a well-dressed woman who approached him.Compared to Athena, she was less flamboyant and gave a more subdued impression, but she had a well-developed face and the grace of an aristocrat.\u201cAre you, by any chance, from the Kingdom?\u201d\u201cHuh? Yeah\u2026\u201dShe smiled, understanding.It seemed that the news of Maria\u2019s and some of the academy student\u2019s visit had spread among the nobles.\u201cThis time, Maria-sama will probably get asked many questions.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. As one of the only people who met Haishin-sama.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah~\u201dKanata nodded, understanding that was also a possibility.\u201cBy the way.\u201d\u201cWhat? \u2026 Huh?\u201dShe approached Kanata closely.Her eyes, looking straight at him, had a terrifying darkness that felt like it was from the abyss, and it was enough to plant fear in Kanata for someone he just met.\u201cIs something wrong\u2026?\u201dAt that moment, Kanata saw a badge that the woman was wearing on her chest.It was definitely a Haishin-sama badge, to which he internally shouted, \u2018You too?\u2019\u201cYou are from the Kingdom, aren\u2019t you? Have you met Haishin-sama? Are Maria-sama and Saint Alphana-sama still the only ones who have met him? Ah, how enviable\u2026 How envy-worthy. But I don\u2019t intend to hate or be jealous of them because it was all Haisin-sama\u2019s will that he decided to meet with these women to ask for their cooperation.\u201d\u201cUm, excuse me\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, sorry, I got carried away.\u201dThe woman, whose name Kanata didn\u2019t know, quickly left him.In all honesty, Kanata wanted to run away immediately, not because she was a follower or her wearing a Haishin-sama badge, but because she sensed a madness that reminded him somewhat of Mira.\u201cAre you also a listener of the Haishin-sama?\u201d\u201cOh, so you are one too.\u201dWell, it seemed he had no choice but to pretend to be a listener.Upon hearing Kanata\u2019s words, the woman\u2019s eyes lit up, and she happily revealed that the greatness of the Haishin was spreading.He didn\u2019t ask why she had such strong feelings for Haishin as she started talking about it on her own.\u201cActually, I was falsely accused and was about to be executed a while back.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201dGetting executed wasn\u2019t a light topic, but when he heard about execution on this land, a letter came to mind.\u201cI was in despair. My fianc\u00e9, sister, and even my family were all enemies at one point. I was thinking of dying, holding onto hatred and sorrow, but then I was saved.\u201dHer fianc\u00e9 and sister. Kanata fully understood who she was.This woman was apparently the lady who was supposed to get executed as written in the letter.\u201cHaishin-sama, that person\u2019s words saved me. My friend had been a fan of his for a long time, but foolishly, I didn\u2019t know about him. I am thankful to him for saving me! I can\u2019t help but regret how foolishly unaware I was at that time!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata was pulling back with all his might as she was repenting to the heavens for her sins.Seeing her in this mad-like state was too scary. He felt like he was watching a horror movie up close.\u201cI want to devote myself to him. I want to use the saved life for his sake. I was born to use this life for him, for Haishin-sama\u2019s sake. My only support and purpose for living is him!!\u201d\u201cO-okay!\u201dKanata stopped her in the heat of the moment, forgetting to use honorifics.Sweat was visible on her forehead as she took deep breaths. It seemed like she had used a lot of energy with the words she had just spoken like a machine gun.Though her face was well-proportioned, her overall appearance was plain, and her clothes, made from a thick fabric, concealed a definite bulge.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.\u201dRegardless of her strange behaviour, Kanata couldn\u2019t help but think that a woman with good style is always wonderful.Right when he was about to head to the artisan district, he encountered quite a lady.When she became aware that she had also acted a little out of control, her face turned red, and she looked down.\u201c\u2026 Excuse me, may I ask where the artisan district is?\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026 Um, if it\u2019s okay with you, I can guide you there.\u201d\u201cReally\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dThough the atmosphere became awkward for both parties, it\u2019s technically all her fault, Kanata thought.\u2026 Well, if you say it was Haishin who changed her so much, he may not be able to say anything back, but at least Kanata himself should have done nothing wrong.Then, with her as a guide, Kanata safely arrived at the artisan district.\u201cOh here\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. You\u2019re from the Kingdom, correct? Let me tell you this. This place is well-known for the development of magical equipment.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 Oh, by the way.\u201dWith a clap of her hands, she lifted up her skirt slightly, taking a ladylike bow.\u201cOnce again, my name is Lisa Inklaid. I am from an earl\u2019s family.\u201dThat\u2019s how she, Lisa, introduced herself.An earl\u2019s position is lower than a duke\u2019s, but both are still high-ranking nobles.After that, Kanata also introduced himself, and they parted ways.Facing so many high-ranking nobles made him feel a little overwhelmed.He smiled wryly.\u201cWell, it\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s go explore!\u201dWith enthusiasm, Kanata began exploring the artisan district with a thrill in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: Making that will lead to its true formAfter parting ways with Earl lady Lisa, Kanata walked around the artisan district.It was fun to look at magical equipment you would never see in the Kingdom. It was like leaving the house and looking at a game or electronics store.\u201cI know they export some to the capital, but I\u2019ve never seen a real store like this before.\u201dAs he said earlier, it made him remember his past life.Even though it was the Principality, a different country, it had the same status system as the Kingdom, and it looked like there was the same polarization between commoners and those of high status.There didn\u2019t seem to be blatant discrimination, but those who appeared to be nobles didn\u2019t seem to approach stores run by commoners.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\u201dAnd as he was looking to find some good stuff.\u201cWell, is there anything good in this store?\u201d\u201cI wonder. This store smells so poor.\u201d\u201cHahaha, no wonder they don\u2019t have a customer.\u201dKanata came across some men wearing uniforms having such a conversation.They were probably students here, but with that conversation, Kanata had to retract his previous statement that discrimination didn\u2019t seem to exist.\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting, man.\u201dKanata sighed and started walking as if to change his mood.\u201cOh\u2026Ohh!!\u201dAs expected of the place known for its advancements in magic equipment, everything he saw was fresh and new.There were items that could compensate for the lack of magic power, even if you had little, items that could alert the owner of imminent danger from far away, and many other things sold around.\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s good. I\u2019m not really interested in that.\u201dThey were all of practical use in this world, but Kanata was looking for something he could use for streaming, so he didn\u2019t look at them much.\u201c\u2026?\u201dAnd while he was in the middle of it.Kanata found a boy about his age inside a store with his back to the outside, making something.\u201c\u2026 Eh, this\u2026\u201dAs Kanata approached the store, he saw a familiar-looking item.\u201cI think they\u2019re earbuds.\u201dYes, they were earphones.Whether or not these were earphones, the round part that would fit into the ear and the thin cord connecting it was similar to the earphones.\u201cOh, a customer?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dHe normally used honorifics, but Kanata spoke to him casually.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cIt converges the sound from the terminal onto it so that only the person\u2019s ears can hear it, not the world outside.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a\u2026 earphone, ain\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cEarphone?\u201d\u201cAh, never mind.\u201dApparently, these were indeed earphones.However, he tilted his head at the word \u2018earphone,\u2019 which Kanata uttered on the spur of the moment, and since they did not have a name for them, the word \u2018earphone\u2019 did not exist after all.\u201cIt\u2019s unusual. No one would even look at this thing, let alone make something with it.\u201d\u201cFor real?\u201d\u201cYeah. I guess it\u2019s partly because I\u2019m a commoner, but basically, it\u2019s hard to do business here if you don\u2019t have connections.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dKanata could tell from his expression that he was going through a lot of hardship.As it was rare for customers to come to this store, he welcomed Kanata inside and served him a drink.\u201cIs it good?\u201d\u201cYeah, and you don\u2019t have to be so formal. We\u2019re around the same age, apparently.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see. Then I\u2019ll do that too.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201dHe smiled again.Though his hair was unkempt and he had freckles, his charming facial features made it hard to feel distant from him.\u201cMy name is Cid. And you are?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Kanata, and I\u2019m from the Kingdom.\u201d\u201cFrom the Kingdom? Heeh!\u201dKanata felt very nostalgic, even though it was just an exchange with another guy.At the academy in the capital, he was looked down upon by the nobles as a commoner, and even his fellow commoners didn\u2019t like him because of his good grades in magic.As a result, he had very few guy friends. So, talking to Cid, the boy who introduced himself as such, was refreshing and brought back memories of his past life.\u201cHey, why did you decide to make this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked! Actually, I got the idea from a guy named Haishin.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dCid\u2019s sudden mention of Haishin surprised Kanata, but he listened attentively to what he had to say.\u201cI\u2019m just a listener, but Haishin is really popular among women. So I thought that if I could create a device that would allow people to hear the best voices in the closest way possible, it could sell well.\u201d\u201cOh, so that\u2019s how you created it?\u201d\u201cExactly! Although\u2026 it\u2019s not selling at all.\u201dCid\u2019s shoulders dropped in disappointment.It was true that even if he could develop such an item as a commoner, it would be difficult to get recognition without connections.\u201cCan I use it for a bit?\u201d\u201cYeah. Of course!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t developed like earphones to have a jack. Instead, it seemed like it picked up waves from a device by sending magic power into it.\u201cAh~ Ah. Ahhh.\u201d\u201c!?\u201dKanata recorded his voice on the device and then transferred the recording to the earphone-shaped item by sending magic power into it.Without noticing Cid\u2019s surprised expression, Kanata listened to his recorded voice through the earphones.\u201c\u2026 Ohh!\u201dThe sound quality was better than he had expected. Although there was occasional random noise, Kanata was deeply impressed by this item that reproduces the earphone\u2019s functionality in this world.He decided to buy a few for the people who came to his mind first, but it was then that he finally noticed Cid\u2019s shocked expression.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cJust now you\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah!\u201dUnintentionally, Kanata remembered what had just happened.He felt so moved that he made a recording with Haishin in mind, and Cid, who listened by his side, must have noticed it.He could try to make an excuse that it was just an impression, or he could lie and say it was not his voice, but either way, he would be suspected even more.\u201cUmm\u2026 well\u2026 it\u2019s a\u2026\u201dKanata was thinking about what to do when two well-dressed men walked into the store where only Kanata and Cid were present.\u201cWhat a dump of a store.\u201d\u201cAnd there\u2019s even a customer. Get out of here. This is a poor man\u2019s store.\u201dThe two men laughed mockingly. They seemed not to have any intentions of buying anything and just wanted to mock Cid.It\u2019s unclear whether Cid didn\u2019t say anything in response because he was used to it or because they were nobles.\u201c\u2026 I\u2026\u201dHowever, Kanata couldn\u2019t stand staying silent.He looked at the two nobles and said.\u201cI think this is a wonderful store. Everything here has soul in it, and what\u2019s more, the person who runs it is nice. Even as a tourist, I find it strange that this store isn\u2019t doing well.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Tch.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your deal, huh?\u201dThey changed their target to Kanata in plain sight.One of them reached out his hand, but Kanata swatted it away by releasing a small amount of his magic power.It was similar to when he had extinguished a fire in class at the academy before, but it was enough to show these two the unusual power of Kanata.\u201cHey, you\u2026\u201d\u201cF**k that\u2026\u201dThey quickly ran out of the store.Words couldn\u2019t convince them, and he didn\u2019t have great conversation abilities. In these sorts of situations, this sheer impact of magic becomes really useful.\u201c\u2026 They\u2019re everywhere, those kinds of people.\u201dSido replied, \u201cYeah, it looks like it,\u201d after a short pause.They stared at each other for a while. Kanata scratched his cheek and opened his mouth. The situation wouldn\u2019t develop into love since they were of the same s*x.\u201cWell, there\u2019s a lot of things, but it\u2019s a big help if you don\u2019t say anything.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I understand. It\u2019s hard to believe, but I\u2019ll keep your secret, as a customer who said that much for me.\u201d\u201d \u2026 Haha.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201dThey laughed together.From then on, the earphone-shaped item got named \u2018earphone\u2019 as Kanata called it.After buying the earphone, Kanata decided to make a suggestion.\u201cHey, Cid, can you make something that\u2019s perfect for me to record my voice? I have something that I\u2019m personally thinking about right now.\u201d\u201cOh, what is it?\u201dKanata consulted with Cid, and he showed great enthusiasm saying he would try it.Although he didn\u2019t say it directly, Cid knew about Kanata but didn\u2019t say anything extraordinary to him.For Kanata, Cid was his first guy friend.\u2026 And so this encounter later revolutionized the whole world.What Kanata asked Cid to develop was a certain item, which would later lead to the completion of an aforementioned combination Kanata would share with his listeners as Haishin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: Both Kingdom and Principality are dangerous, seriously.That evening after Kanata and Maria travelled to the Principality, Alphana went to the church after school.Today she had made plans to talk with Kanna, a high-class courtesan.Even though she is high-class, was it really okay to allow a prostitute like Kanna into the holy church? The people in this church had no such discrimination in mind. She could visit without any problem.\u201c\u2026 Haaah.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAlphana and Kanna both have heavy feelings toward Haishin\u2026 No. Let\u2019s just admit it, they both have strong feelings toward Kanata.When they reunited after a few days, they talked only about Kanata.However, during their conversation, Alphana let out a sigh.Kanna nodded as if she understood, as it was similar to the longing for a lover who couldn\u2019t meet.\u201cYou miss him?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 yeah. I miss him.\u201dIncidentally, at first, Kanna used to speak respectfully to Alphana, but she asked her to refer to her informally, so her language was more casual now.(\u2026 Well, it\u2019s only natural, given his charm.)Being a prostitute, she did not usually go out. It was also not often that Kanna met Kanata without making an appointment beforehand.Alphana\u2019s loneliness is immeasurable as she attends the same institute, is in the same class and is the closest to him.\u201c\u2026?\u201dBut then Kanna tilted her head.Alphana certainly had an air of loneliness around her, but she also seemed excited about something else.Her expression, gestures, and distinctive aroma led Kanna to the answer she did not expect.She has a keen eye for observation, honed through her experience with many men as a prostitute, and it naturally works on women as well.(Maybe Saint-sama\u2026 is in heat?)Although it\u2019s a crude way of putting it, Kanna thinks it\u2019s normal for her age, but she would never say it out loud.The saint is also a human being and a girl. It\u2019s only natural for her to have feelings for someone she loves.\u201c\u2026 haah.\u201dNevertheless, Kanna was troubled, so she sighed repeatedly.She found herself lost in their conversation, not knowing what to say as Alphana seemed in her own world.\u201c\u2026 Saint-sama?\u201d\u201c\u2026 yes.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 You\u2019ve been spacing out since earlier, is something wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter a short pause, Alphana apologized quietly.Wondering if perhaps there was something troubling her, Kanna pulled a chair up close to Alphana.She asked her if she would like to discuss anything with her, as Kanna is young but still older than Alphana.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that, a worry or anything\u2026 It\u2019s just that his voice won\u2019t leave my head.\u201d\u201cVoice?\u201dAlphana explained to Kanna, who wondered what exactly it was about.She explained that Kanata was thinking of providing the world with ASMR content. After listening to the recording of Kanata\u2019s sweet whispering directed towards her, her mind was completely engrossed.\u201cIs it really that amazing?\u201d\u201cAs a Saint, I shouldn\u2019t use such a crude expression, but it feels like my head is getting violated by Kanata-sama\u2019s voice!\u201dAlphana wound up, with her excitement unabated.As a prostitute, Kanna had already passed the dimension of thinking about whether such words as \u2018violating\u2019 were crude or not, so Kanna didn\u2019t think much of it, but she was also interested in this thing called ASMR.\u201cI\u2019m kind of curious.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, would you like to listen? The words got directed at me, but he hasn\u2019t mentioned my name so far, so I think Kanna-san will be able to hear it too.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then, I shall try it out for a bit.\u201dLittle did she know that it was a trap that was about to drag Kanna into a swamp.She was handed a terminal and told to listen while in the position she felt the most relaxing.\u201cWell, there you go.\u201dShe sank deep into the sofa, pressing her back against it and achieving a state of complete relaxation.And now, with the terminal close to her ear, she listened to Kanata\u2019s voice, which she heard so much from Alphana, in a completely defenceless state.A few minutes later, after saying goodbye to Alphana, Kanna returned to the brothel.\u201cWelcome back, Kanna.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cKanna?\u201dShe didn\u2019t stop to reply and headed for her room as if she didn\u2019t hear the owner.In fact, she had a reservation coming up, and going to her room at this point would be a complete turn-off.It was a rare sight for her, who had never cut corners on her work, much less slacked off.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, owner, but please cancel all my reservations for today.\u201d\u201cOh, uh\u2026 that\u2019s fine with me.\u201dKanna was one of the best earners in Veneti, and perhaps because of it, she could ask for a certain number of unreasonable demands.\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dThe owner\u2019s body jerked when he turned around and saw Kanna\u2019s eyes.\u201cWhatever happens today, don\u2019t come into my room, and don\u2019t let anyone near me. Promise, okay? If you break it, I won\u2019t forgive you.\u201d\u201cI get it!\u201dThe owner saw the strong glow in her eyes.Keeping his promise, he instructed everyone that no one was allowed near her room today.And in the end, no one knew what had happened to her.******\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cIs something in your mind?\u201dAs the sun set, Kanata looked into the distance while enjoying his meal.He was unsure what he sensed just now. It was as if someone was moaning while repeating his name.[EDN: Why.]\u201c\u2026 Has anyone heard the rumours?\u201d\u201cAra, I probably have, you see.\u201dHe didn\u2019t press her on what she meant by that.Incidentally, it wasn\u2019t only Kanata and Maria, but all the classmates with them gathered there.\u201cFufu, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re satisfied.\u201dAthena said while gazing happily at Kanata and the others.They were at her ducal mansion, and today, they would spend the night in this magnificent building.\u201cBut then again, you\u2019re a little different from the rest, after all,\u201d Athena said, looking at Kanata and Maria.The other classmates looked at them as if they were also interested, but Maria was the first to speak back.\u201cI have become somewhat friendly with Kanata-kun, but he is not the type of person to worry about. Even though I am used to it, he is not. Athena, I hope you will stop that kind of thing.\u201dMaria spoke clearly to Athena.She emphasized that Kanata was not the type of person to be the subject of rumours, but Athena still seemed interested in him.Nevertheless, it was understandable since her words were uttered with the utmost consideration for Kanata.\u201cI really appreciate your thoughtfulness, Princess. I am a commoner, so it is difficult for me to find a place in the academy. However, you protect me and take care of me. You are truly a kind person, and I think you are a princess loved by everyone in the kingdom.\u201d\u201cK-Kanata-kun\u2026!\u201d\u201cAra\u2026ara, ara \u266a.\u201d\u2026 Apparently, he made a mistake in his choice of words.Kanata looked away, feeling uncomfortable as Maria, whose face turned bright red and looked impressed, and Athena, whose smile deepened further in amusement, stared at him.\u201cExcuse me, Lady Athena.\u201dThat\u2019s when it happened.The door opened, and a woman appeared, but she was familiar with Kanata.Earl\u2019s daughter, Lisa, was the one who showed up.\u201cYou\u2019re here, Lisa.\u201d\u201cYes. Um\u2026\u201dApparently, Lisa didn\u2019t know why she got called in, either.When Kanata\u2019s eyes met hers, she bowed and approached Athena\u2019s side.\u201cAs a matter of fact, there was once a time when this girl was in an extreme situation.\u201dThe air stiffened a little at those words.\u201cBut it was Haishin-sama who saved her. It was his words that saved her from execution. Well, that doesn\u2019t excuse my helplessness at that time.\u201dNot only Kanata but also Maria and the others seemed to understand who Lisa was when she used the words \u2018Principality\u2019 and \u2018execution.\u2019It was even more so when it came to Maria, who sent a statement along with Alphana.\u201cMaria, since you are the only one who has met Haishin-sama, I would like you to tell Lisa many things about him. This girl has become an ardent fan of Haishin-sama since then, just like me.\u201d\u201cReally? I don\u2019t mind.\u201dThen, with Kanata by her side, Maria talked about her passionate feelings for Haishin.It wasn\u2019t just Lisa, who listened to the story, but also other classmates who were also followers of Haishin, which made the atmosphere even more lively.(Staaaaaaaaph! My back is tickling!!)Naturally, Kanata was writhing in embarrassment.\u201c\u2026 Fufu.\u201dHowever, Athena kept her stare fixed on Kanata with a seductive look, which was different from the reactions of the others.Although Kanata didn\u2019t notice her gaze, Maria, while talking about Haishin and being attentive, did.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Even though there weren\u2019t any mistakes, how did she?\u201cThis room is amazing!\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s the best!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter the meal, Kanata and the boys were in the room where they planned to sleep.The dining room was worthy of a grand mansion owned by the duke, and the same could be said for the guest rooms, which also looked very expensive.(\u2026 Rich people sure are something.)Kanata also has some donations from his live streaming, so he can be considered rich, but since he hasn\u2019t used his money in an obvious way, he still has the mentality of not wasting it.\u201cHey Kanata, how\u2019s the report going for you?\u201d\u201cEh? It\u2019s going okay. I\u2019ll put together the things I saw in the artisan district.\u201d\u201cOh, you went there? We went to the noble\u2019s district, though\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 It was different from what I expected.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dThey weren\u2019t fully opened up to each other yet, but they had become friends to the point where they would call each other by name.It\u2019s better like that than feeling tense when they sleep in the same room. It brought Kanata memories of middle school.It was common for everyone to gather and sleep together during school trips, so it felt nostalgic for him.(\u2026 it looks like I won\u2019t be able to stream today.)He wasn\u2019t sure, though he had already told his listeners.He felt uneasy because he had been streaming almost every day, so taking a day off felt strange. It could be taken as a sign of him being a workaholic.\u201cHey-hey, Kanata.\u201d\u201cY-yeah?\u201dHe also thought it felt a little too familiar, but he didn\u2019t have to worry too much if he could talk like this.The guy who had spoken to Kanata, who had laid on his bed, sat down.\u201cYou know about Haishin, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. I know about him.\u201dOf course, he couldn\u2019t say that he was Haishin.He laughed, followed with \u201cI see,\u201d and began to speak excitedly about something.\u201cThat guy\u2026 I might get in trouble for saying this, but Haishin sure is really amazing! Even people like Princess Maria and Athena-san are his followers. He really has a charm that attracts many people!\u201d\u201cRight\u2026\u201dFor Kanata, this was the first time he had been praised so much by a guy his age.Of course, the guy had no idea that Kanata was Haishin, but he seemed to think of him as a listener and continued talking.\u201cThere was never anything like live streaming before, and who would have thought that just transmitting your voice could bring such a fun time? And now, with hand streaming and such, he even showed us the Princess and Saint on that legendary day! It makes me feel like he\u2019s showing us a new turning point in history!\u201dHe was incredibly passionate.And it seemed like he still had more to say as he moved closer to Kanata.\u201cO-okay, but keep some distance in between!\u201dIt was a bit bothersome.He huffed as he came to his senses, but the rest of the roommates laughed and shook their shoulders.\u201cThat guy is a real fan of Haishin. I think he\u2019s an interesting fella, but nothing more than that.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a b*****d!\u201d\u201c.., You\u2019re a pain.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Well-well.\u201dHowever, it\u2019s better that they don\u2019t hate or are against him.If so, hearing negative things about Haishin would be hard for him.\u201cI wonder if there will be a stream today.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like there will be one\u2026\u201dYes, there won\u2019t be a stream today, Kanata smiled wryly.Since it was already nightfall, there was no point in going out, but Kanata still wanted to feel the outside air, so he got up and went out of the room.Even though it was night, there were no restrictions on going out. As long as he had the identification badge that allowed him to stay there, he could go out without any problems.\u201cWell, as long as I don\u2019t do anything that would shame Princess Maria.\u201dSince Maria brought him here, if Kanata did something strange, it would be a nuisance for her, so he must be careful.As soon as he left the room and was about to go outside, he met her again.\u201cOh, Kanata-san?\u201d\u201c.. Hi.\u201dIt was Lisa who was there.She, from an earlship, and Athena, from the duchy, became friends through some hobby, and it seemed they established a relationship that transcended their positions.Lisa was staying here today, and that showed how well she and Athena got along.They had already introduced themselves, and although they were not too familiar with one another, they called each other on a first-name basis.\u201cHow come you\u2019re here?\u201d\u201cI just thought I\u2019d get some fresh air.\u201dIt seems that they came for the same purpose.However, it\u2019s not quite appropriate for a man to go out at night with a woman, especially since she is a noble with a promised future. Kanata thought it would be trouble to create any rumours.\u201cWould you like to come along?\u201d\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s okay, I\u2019m good.\u201d\u201cI see. Alright then.\u201dShe politely bowed her head and headed outside.Honestly, Kanata thought it might be a bit odd for a noblewoman to go out alone, but he assumed the security was tight and there was nothing to worry about.After all, there were soldiers on guard duty at the gates and in the gardens on a rotating schedule.\u201cKanata-kun?\u201d\u201cKanata-san?\u201dAs he walked around the mansion without purpose, he met Maria and Athena. They both had flushed faces, and it seemed like they had just come out from the bath.\u201cSo you went to the bath?\u201d\u201cYes, it was so nice.\u201d\u201cFufu, and we talked a lot there, right?\u201dIt was a grand bath that reminded him of a hot spring. He had taken a bath earlier with his roommates, who had also joined later.Not only was the water nice, but there were also magic devices that made it like a jacuzzi, which reminded him of his childhood.\u201cWe could talk about a lot of things. But all you wanted to talk about was Haishin-sama.\u201d\u201cAnd why shouldn\u2019t I? I can\u2019t help but wonder, you know? The only people who actually met Haishin-sama are you, Lady Saint, and the very limited number of people in the castle, right? It\u2019s unfair!!\u201d\u201cEven if you say it\u2019s unfair\u2026 \u201cMaria sighed as if to express she was tired.The two of them, who had just gotten out of the bath, gave off a very seductive vibe, and for Kanata, it was a feast for the eyes to see them, but it was still embarrassing.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll be back in a bit.\u201dKanata tried to escape to the garden, but Athena called out to him.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cEh? I\u2019m just going to take some fresh air outside.\u201dIf only he could have gone with Lisa, he thought.Athena listened to Kanata\u2019s response, narrowed her eyes meaningfully and clapped her hands before proposing something.\u201cI\u2019ll follow you. Maria, you should come too.\u201d\u201cOf course. I can\u2019t leave you alone with Kanata-kun.\u201dAnd so, Kanata visited the garden at night with the two of them.The night air was chilly, but it seemed to cool down their warm bodies in an enjoyable way.(\u2026 Lisa-san\u2019s not here?)Kanta looked around, wondering where Lisa went.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201dMaria, who stood next to him, commented as she looked at the night garden in awe.The flowers, wet from the dew, seemed to reflect the moonlight as if they were shining, creating a fantastical view.\u201c\u2026 The moon sure is beautiful,\u201d Kanata said.\u201cYes, it really is beautiful,\u201d Maria agreed.Maria also looked beautiful standing in this garden, illuminated by the moonlight.Kanata\u2019s comment about the moon being beautiful had a certain meaning behind it, but in this world, that meaning did not exist, so Maria simply nodded at Kanata\u2019s words.\u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it.\u201dAthena also stood next to Kanata, as did Maria.\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dKanata wondered why Athena was standing next to him instead of next to Maria, but he didn\u2019t want to voice his question as it might seem like he was conscious of it.\u201cBy the way, there aren\u2019t any soldiers here, are there?\u201d\u201cWell, no. A barrier made by magical equipment surrounds this garden, so if any suspicious presence enters, it would get detected.\u201d\u201cHeh, I see\u2026\u201dIt seemed like a motion-sensor-like device was installed.Kanata was impressed by cutting-edge Principality.\u201cSo\u2026 I guess it\u2019s time to go.\u201dBut it was a trap, a bomb thrown at him when his guard was down.\u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it, but if possible, can you tell me, in your own words, what you actually thought about it, Haishin-sama?\u201dSo Athena asked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: Clinging to Haishin\u201cHaishin-sama\u2014.\u201dThat\u2019s right. Athena said it.Kanata was flustered, but he managed to pull himself together thanks to Maria standing in front of him.\u201cFrom the looks of it, I guess I got it right, huh?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah.\u201dMaria bit her lip as if she got played like a fiddle and exposed it with her actions.\u201c\u2026 During dinner, you were looking at Kanata-kun with a serious look. I didn\u2019t think it would be the case, but\u2026 haah, I failed.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dKanata turned his gaze in surprise.Chuckling, Athena hid her mouth with a fan, which suited her aristocratic demeanour very well.However, since Maria seemed to feel sorry for Kanata, he placed his hand on her shoulder and said there was no need for that.\u201cDon\u2019t make that face, Maria, just smile like you always do.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Kanata-kun.\u201dKanata felt a bit embarrassed by his awkward line, but he turned his gaze back to Athena.At this point, it was too late for excuses to work and lying would probably be seen through, so Kanata looked at her with composure.\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cPlease stop using honorifics.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata\u2019s eyes widened in surprise as Athena said that.He was so surprised that he twitched his shoulders. He started thinking that she was maybe not a difficult person after all.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t think I did anything particularly noticeable in front of you.\u201d\u201cIt was simple.\u201dShe stepped forward and closed the distance with Kanata.She snapped her fan shut with a sound and spoke with confidence, saying something unexpected.\u201cMaria\u2019s eyes were the same as for a live broadcast, and Haishin-sama\u2019s height next to Maria was also the same. Usually, it is hard to identify his natural voice because he was wearing a mask at that time through his equipment, but I got convinced by how you breathed.\u201dWho could have predicted that he would get identified through Maria\u2019s eyes, his height, and his breathing?Nevertheless, so were Maria and Alphana, and Kanata was affected enough to think that such a thing could happen, considering that even Mira was aware of it.\u201c\u2026 So.\u201d\u201cYes\u201d\u201cNow that you know I\u2019m Haishin, what do you want to do?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a given!\u201dAthena put her hands on her hips and puffed out her chest as if fireworks had gone off behind her.\u201cI also want to lend you a hand with what I can do! As a fan of Haisin-sama, and above all, as someone who has fallen madly in love with you.\u201d\u201cW-Wait a minute!?\u201dAs Athena moved closer and closer, Kanata panicked and put his hands in front of him, but Maria stepped forward again to protect him, breathing heavily and blocking Athena\u2019s face with her hand.\u201cHmph, hmph!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to stop you or anything. But you look really scary right now\u2026\u201dAthena\u2019s beautiful face got distorted as Maria\u2019s fingers pressed into her nostrils, but she seemed not to notice. Her eyes were filled with fierce determination as she stared at Kanata.It was a terrifying sight, though not as shocking as when Mira had entered his room. Still, it was a scary scene.\u201cJust calm down for now, Athena-san.\u201d\u201cI understand!\u201dShe took a step back and caught her breath.(\u2026 What\u2019s wrong with this world? There are so many weird people in it. I mean. They\u2019re all beautiful, but there are so many weirdos.)He muttered it twice in his mind because it was important.Kanata thinks that she also mentioned that she would like to help.\u201cUm\u2026 wanting to help, that is\u2026 no, I understand what you mean. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t plan on doing much outside of the Kingdom right now. And with Maria and Alphana helping me, I already have enough.\u201d\u201cHmph! You hear that, Athena!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Gununu!\u201dIt\u2019s certainly nice that she wanted to help, but her sudden offer was overwhelming and hard to process.If she had calmed down, he might talk to her about any potential activities he could do as Haishin in the Principality.But it doesn\u2019t seem to be the case as of now.\u201cWell, thank you, Athena-san. Even here, away from the Kingdom, it\u2019s nice to have someone who speaks kindly to me like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Haishin-sama!\u201dKanata knew that he had fans all over the world, not just in the Kingdom, but it was still nice to have someone express their admiration so fervently.Athena felt moved by his words.Her eyes filled with emotion as she tried to approach him again, only to get pushed away by Maria again.\u201c\u2026 but the view is really awesome.\u201dHe took his eyes off the two and looked at the fantastical garden that spread out before them.Athena\u2019s castle was probably not open to anyone without permission, so it was a view only seen by a select few.It would be interesting to live stream this beautiful view, but unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have the equipment for it.\u201cAthena, why don\u2019t you become a member of the support group for Haishin-sama?\u201d\u201cI will!\u201d\u201cAre you regressing to a child?\u201dAthena\u2019s voice was quite cute as she shouted with enthusiasm.Kanata was in the middle of asking Maria what this support group was when Maria exclaimed in surprise.\u201cHaishin-sama, I want to make sure you know this.\u201d\u201cO-okay.\u201d\u201cI may have acted wildly before, but I swear, as your fan, I will never be a nuisance to you. So please\u2026 rest easy.\u201d\u201cI understand. Thank you, Athena-san.\u201dHe had a feeling that she wasn\u2019t lying, somehow.Now that things had come to this, he thought that perhaps in the future, he might be able to plan some kind of event not only in the Kingdom but also throughout the Principality.It might be too optimistic to think this way, like in his past life, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to dream a little.\u201cIt\u2019s getting a bit chilly.\u201dAs it got a bit colder, Kanata shook his shoulders. Maria and Athena were still talking, but he felt a bit cold and decided to go back inside.\u201cToday was a wonderful day\u2026 Ah \u266a.\u201dAthena looked truly satisfied. However, there was still something bothering Kanata\u2014it was about Lisa.\u201cI didn\u2019t get to see Lisa-san.\u201d\u201cWhat about Lisa?\u201d Athena asked.\u201cOh, Lisa said she wanted some fresh air and went outside. I just thought it was strange that we didn\u2019t run into her.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2026 Kanata had a kind of bad feeling about this.\u201cLet\u2019s check the room where Lisa is supposed to be.\u201dThey went to Lisa\u2019s room, but unfortunately, she wasn\u2019t there.They searched the mansion for her without making too much noise, but they couldn\u2019t find her anywhere. Even the guards who were watching the gate hadn\u2019t seen her.\u201cThis is strange\u2026\u201d\u201cThey should\u2019ve noticed if she had gone outside, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. If there were intruders, the guards would have reacted, but I still can\u2019t shake off this feeling of unease\u2026 I hope it\u2019s not something like an abduction.\u201dEven though his true identity got revealed and it seemed to have settled calmly, it ended up becoming something suspicious and fishy at the most unexpected time.Even though magical tools were developed to detect when someone goes in and out, there can also be tools that allow one to slip through such security.However, this was a castle and mansion owned by a noble like Athena, so it\u2019s unlikely that there is someone foolish to lay their hands on a duke\u2019s territory.\u201c\u2026 No way, don\u2019t tell me\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dThen Athena told them that Lisa\u2019s life got spared by avoiding the extreme penalty, but at the cost of losing her family ties.It turns out that her step-sister had gone on a rampage using the magic eye, and even though the incident got resolved and Lisa was freed from the curse, her relationship with her family remained cold.\u201cI see. So even though it\u2019s her step-sister\u2019s fault, Lisa\u2019s family might resent her for the mess she caused.\u201d\u201cIt would be rash of them if that\u2019s the case.\u201dHowever, the truth was still unknown, but as far as Kanata was concerned, Lisa was someone he had helped once.\u201cIf Lisa\u2019s family is involved, in a way, I\u2019m not unrelated to it either,\u201d Kanta said.\u201cHaishin-sama\u2026\u201dIn any case, he had made a decision. Kanata decided and faced forward.******\u201cWhy would you do something so foolish?\u201d\u201cShut up! You\u2019re the one who pushed us to h**l! If only you got executed, that child wouldn\u2019t have lost her eyes!\u201dWith a slap, Lisa got hit by her father.As Athena had suspected, Lisa\u2019s disappearance was caused by her family.In the end, whether or not Lisa was under evil\u2019s eye enchanting was irrelevant. Her family simply disliked her after that incident.Her family only saw her younger sister, and they considered Lisa, who had hindered her sister\u2019s ambition, a nuisance.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid, as I have that person with me.\u201dWho that person is, was not relevant to the current situation, but if he had to ask, he would question if this girl was mentally stable.Of course, unlike Athena, Lisa didn\u2019t realize that Kanata was Haishin and only clung to the delusional thought that he was always with her.Haishin was the light that saved Lisa from despair, and she couldn\u2019t help but rely on him emotionally.\u201cYou are the one who is stupid! You are the one who got deceived by a filthy entity!\u201dHer family, including her sister, resented Haishin for bringing them misfortune, so it was natural that they did not look favourably at Lisa, who believed in Haishin.\u201cIt\u2019s all because you were here. Everything went wrong\u2026 because of you!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLisa never believes in miracles, only in Haishin.What happened next was to protect her, but he was unaware that his actions would only drag her further into the swamp. This world is truly over.\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cHuh!?\u201d\u201cWho are you!?\u201dThe voice that echoed in the dim underground room belonged to a mysterious man wearing a black outfit and a mask. For Lisa, he was the embodiment of hope and everything she holds dear.\u201c\u2026 ah\u2026 ahh!\u201dShe knew him despite his disguise.\u201cHaishin-sama\u2026!!\u201dYes, it was Haishin who showed up.[Postscript]The Dark Knight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: Wrong! That\u2019s wrong!(\u2026I can\u2019t just do something like this on a whim.)Lisa was in the basement of her home with her family, as the information provided indicated.Her cheeks were swollen, as if she got slapped, but didn\u2019t seem to be in pain or sad.\u201cHaishin-sama \u266a.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dOn the contrary, she had a big smile and sparkling eyes.She seemed to be just like a small child seeing their hero. She was like this during dinner too, and from what he heard before coming here, it appears that she was completely engrossed in the existence known as \u2018Haishin\u2019.\u201cYou\u2026 you are Haishin!!\u201dIt was probably Lisa\u2019s father who screamed that.He was quite plump and seemed to have a luxurious diet, with the body shape of a stereotypical noble villain.After he shouted \u201cHaishin,\u201d a killing intent emerged, making them feel as if they were under intense pressure.\u201cYou\u2026 are you Haishin? The person who made me like this\u2026 \u201c\u201cHmm, I see. So you\u2019re Lisa\u2019s sister.\u201dIt was only because he was wearing a mask that Kanata could become Haishin.The girl sitting in the wheelchair, who he thought to be Lisa\u2019s sister, spoke in agony.\u201cIt\u2019s because of what you did that I had to go through such a miserable experience! If you weren\u2019t there, I would be happy now!!\u201dAnna, Lisa\u2019s sister, shouted.Those words did not convey any sense of guilt for trying to harm Lisa. It was clear that she only saw herself as a tragic heroine.The family gathered around Anna, who had a frail body and consoled her.(\u2026 Well, whatever happened, my intervention made them miserable. Though I didn\u2019t mean to do anything wrong.)The power to change something with just one word.That\u2019s what he got blessed with.Because of Kanata, Lisa was saved, but on the other hand, those who thought Lisa was unimportant felt the waves of misfortune.Kanata thought what he did was right, but from their point of view, it was him who they should curse for their misfortune.\u201cIs that all you have to say? You caused all of this, be ready to accept your punishment.\u201dAnd, of course, not only Kanata but also Maria and Athena were there.It was understandable that the presence of a princess and a duke\u2019s daughter in such a place might be questionable. However, they could step into such a place because their presence was overwhelmingly more reliable than the guards around.\u201cWhat do you want me to do, Haishin-sama?\u201dIt was Mira who asked Kanata this question.\u2026 For now, let\u2019s put aside why she was here and focus on solving the problem at hand.However, they understood that the situation took a turn for worse when Maria and Athena showed up.\u201cWhy, Athena-sama! We just\u2026 It\u2019s for our daughter\u2019s sake\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Father and mother did it for me\u2014\u201dAnd in the end, they showed no concern for Lisa at all.Although she got completely abandoned by her family, Lisa\u2019s feelings waver.She simply kept staring at Kanata with all her heart.\u201c\u2026 Well, there\u2019s a lot going on, but for now, Mira.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMira disappeared quickly, as if she had teleported, landed next to Lisa, supporting her body and jumped back.\u201cHa!\u201d\u201cGive her back! Give her back!\u201d\u2018Give back\u2019 \u2026 If only she meant them with kindness to prevent taking her sister away, it would have made one feel the love between sisters, but Anna was probably angry because she could not dispose of Lisa.And that seems to be the same for the other family members.\u201cMaria.\u201d\u201cYes. Come here, Lisa-san.\u201dThey achieved their goal, but they were now fully hostile toward us.It was clear that they no longer intended to be reserved, even when Maria and Athena were here.\u201c\u2026 To tell you the truth, I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind, too.\u201dKanata looked forward and began to speak.Although his expression was hidden behind a mask, his voice conveyed a sense of anguish, like he was thinking deeply about something.\u201cI brought her up during the stream because I wanted to help her, and I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong doing so. But certainly, I\u2019m saddened that she had to lose her eyes.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the point now, ha?\u201dAnna\u2019s punishment was to have her eyes removed. In comparison, it wouldn\u2019t be strange for the punishment of the crime of trying to execute her sister by turning other nobles into puppets with the evil eyes to be the death penalty.Looking at it this way, being alive was already a plus.\u201cThe elder sister should sacrifice herself for her younger sister, right!? All for her sister\u2019s happiness! That\u2019s normal, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! As this child says!!\u201d\u201cYes!!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFrankly, it was a scene of \u2018what the heck were they talking about?\u2019Anna and her family members were clearly not normal, and if one suspects this was unique to this other world, I assure you it is surely not.Maria, Athena, and even Mira, who basically had poker faces, changed their expression to disgust.(Maybe they are the biggest victims of the evil eye after all.)The full extent of the evil eyes\u2019 power was unknown, but it was possible that Anna went insane due to its influence.And it was also possible that her family also became abnormal due to some side effects caused by the evil eyes.\u201cNevertheless, that\u2019s the way it is.\u201dStill, Kanata got convinced that what they were saying was wrong.\u201cTo sacrifice one for someone else is not how a family should be. What you are saying is wrong.\u201dStrangely, the words he said carried power from before.They probably wouldn\u2019t listen to anything Kanata says here and say that he, Kanata, was, in fact, wrong.In other words, no matter how he talked to them, he could only draw a parallel with them.\u201cAthena, you take care of the rest.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dThen, as originally planned, Athena used the men she had brought with her to capture them all and save the day.Mira, despite her small size, was considerably strong, and she was the one who brought him here in time while jumping from building to building.\u201cAnyway, I won\u2019t ask why Mira is here.\u201d\u201cEh? It\u2019s alright, really.\u201d\u201c\u2026 because I\u2019m scared.\u201dKanata took his eyes off her tilted head and looked at Lisa again.\u201cHaishin-sama\u2026 I\u2026 I!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah~\u201dHer eyes were shining even more than before.Even though there was a future where she would have gotten killed, as if the events of being kidnapped never happened, she was smiling.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe.\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026\u201dLisa\u2019s face was as if she had smoked a drug, for lack of a better word, just by hearing his one word.When Kanata wondered how he should treat Lisa, Mira sensed it and smacked Lisa\u2019s nape with her hand.\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cOops\u2026\u201dLisa almost fell down as she had lost consciousness, but Kanata, who was in front of her, caught her.\u201cBecause you seemed troubled.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know what to tell her any more than that, so it was helpful for Kanata.Soon after, Maria and Athena returned, and the case got solved\u2026As for Kanata, he did not expect to see such a commotion when he was moving out of the country, and letting out a big sigh revealed his fatigue.\u201cThank you for your hard work, Kanata-kun.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201dIncidentally, he heard that the maximum penalty won\u2019t be imposed on them even though they committed such a thing.Instead, they will be judged quite heavily and treated under the care of professionals who can heal them with regard to the magic that corrupted their minds.\u201cBut still, I should have been more careful. I can\u2019t blame Lisa. The blame is on me for being so complacent.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Families come in all shapes and sizes, and I also thought the same thing, that \u2018this can\u2019t be a real family.\u2019\u201dRegretting won\u2019t change anything, but since the situation got resolved, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.Kanata left Lisa in Athena\u2019s care and wanted to take it easy and talk with Mira for a while in the room where she was staying.And then\u2014\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201dThe next morning, he woke up in the same bed as Maria.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Get to know its destructive power firsthand\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSuu\u2026 Suu\u2026\u201dIt was the morning of the day after Lisa got kidnapped. With the help of Mira, who had followed him here without him knowing it, the case was successfully resolved.Although he was tired from last night, he remembered spending a little bit of time chatting with Maria in her room.\u201c\u2026 I fell asleep just like that?\u201dWhen he woke up, he was surprised by the overwhelmingly sweet smell tickling his nostrils, but it turned out to be the scent emanating from Maria.It is a big problem to sleep in the same bed as a princess, but fortunately, there was no disorder in their clothes, so it was natural, and he felt relieved that they did not do the one thing they should not have done.\u201cAh, you\u2019re awake, Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Mira, huh? I didn\u2019t do anything, did I?\u201d\u201cYes, you have done nothing, Kanata-sama. And Maria-sama has done nothing to you either.\u201dHe knew Mira might\u2019ve watched him all night but decided not to ask about her words of choice.\u201cUn\u2026 fumyu.\u201dWhilst letting out a cute voice, Maria turned her body towards Kanta.It was still early in the morning and a little cold, so Maria curled up her body, but her clothes were slightly disheveled, and her cleavage was in a state of \u2018good morning\u2019.[EN: I know what this means. I don\u2019t know how it relates to what I know it means.]\u201c\u2026 Uhh, thank you for yesterday, Mira,\u201d Kanta tried to play it off.Mira, not paying it much mind, smiled beautifully and nodded as if pleased to be thanked.\u201cBy the way, Kanata-sama went to sleep first yesterday, so Maria-sama was worried, wondering if it was okay for them to sleep in the same bed together.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for doing something so thoughtless.\u201d\u201cNo, it was the direction that she was struggling with\u2026 Well. If she were to go in that direction, I would have stopped her.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by direction?\u201dMira did not tell Kanata in the end.\u201cHere\u2019s the report.\u201dAnd she briefly told him about what happened afterwards.Lisa was safe, Athena had returned, and it seemed the matter from the day before had been settled in secret.\u201cWell, that\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cIt is only natural since Kanata-sama was involved.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t have to be involved. I\u2019m not that all-powerful person. Mira was there, and Maria and Athena were also there for me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dKanata continued to speak to Mira, who was still unconvinced.It was something he had been thinking about a lot recently, and he had thought about putting it into words during the live stream if he had the chance.\u201cI\u2019ve made quite a name for myself as Haishin, but fundamentally, I am no different from anyone else, just a human\u2026 who\u2019s surrounded by all kinds of people.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, it\u2019s not that I have to be the one to be involved or that what I say is absolute. Mira, don\u2019t expect too much from me, okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026 got it.\u201dMira nodded, and Kanta gestured to her, gently stroking her head.Even though they were the same age, she always felt like a younger sister or a junior because of her small stature.\u201c\u2026 ehehe \u266a.\u201dIt is hard to understand this world because the person who smiled happily like this was a legendary assassin whose fame remains to this day.As he stroked Mira\u2019s head like that, he felt an intense gaze behind me.When he turned around wondering, Maria, who was lying down sideways, was staring at Kanta and Mira with wide-open eyes.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata and Maria stared at each other, and Kanata was the first to speak.\u201cGood morning\u2026\u201dWhen Kanata said this, Maria got up.Despite the fact that her clothes were as disheveled as ever, she stretched her arms toward the ceiling as if to unclench her stiff body.\u201cUn~! Ahh \u266a\u201dThe chest wobbled as she lowered her arm, and Kanata quickly looked away.He looked at Mira to find her staring at him with her usual poker face.He could hear sounds from behind and the bed creaking as Maria approached.\u201cGood morning, Kanata-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yeah.\u201dHe assumed she was probably behind him.But before he knew it, he heard a satisfied sigh and felt Maria pull him back onto the bed.And there they lay, side by side again.\u201cLet\u2019s take it easy in the morning, Kanata-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Umm\u201d\u201cAn \u266a\u201dWhile it was true one would like to relax in the morning, the current position was not the best for Kanata.He thought he merely got pulled by Maria, but what actually happened was that Kanata\u2019s face moved to Maria\u2019s chest.In other words, even the slightest breath sent a trembling vibration from his nose to Maria\u2019s chest.\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been losing to Alphana lately. I have to work harder too.\u201dMaria murmured.Kanata had accidentally felt a woman\u2019s chest before, but this was the first time he did it with his face, which made him turn bright red.\u201cHey, Kanata-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ou.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not good in terms of public image, but the only ones who know about this are us here.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 it is.\u201d\u201cSo don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s natural for people to sleep alone as they get older, but it\u2019s nice to feel someone\u2019s warmth again after a long time and feel reassured.\u201d\u201c\u2026 indeed.\u201dKanata agreed with what Maria said. He was certainly surprised to see her sleeping face next to him as soon as he woke up, but it was still comforting to have someone else\u2019s warmth in the same bed.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad\u2026 It kind of reminds me of when I used to sleep with my mom.\u201d\u201cReally? So, am I like your mom?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d\u201cOh, why not?\u201dMaria laughed and let Kanata go. After getting up, Kanata quickly returned to his room and was asked where he had gone, but he managed to make excuses.Then, it was time for breakfast, and Kanata couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her.\u201c\u2026\u201dLisa.She hadn\u2019t touched her breakfast and was in a daze as if staring into the void.Even though it made him a bit uneasy, Athena just smiled, enjoying it.\u201cShe said that Haishin-sama hugged him and has been in a dreamlike state ever since. So, let\u2019s let her soak in her dream for a while.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dBy the way, it was only uncomfortable for Athena to speak in honorifics, so he asked her to do so normally.Kanata thought as he took his gaze away from Lisa and sipped his soup.(\u2026 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m thinking straight now that you mention it. If something happens, she\u2019ll notice it right away.)Nevertheless, Kanata was also a little too concerned.In the first place, it\u2019s not like he can avoid being found out, except during the encounter with Cid.The way he talks and the quality of his magic, or the fact that someone might infiltrate during his livestream. It\u2019s these things that can be seen through by an incredibly observant eye\u2026 Even if he\u2019s careful, there are some things that can\u2019t be helped.\u201cHey, Kanata, you got a finger in your soup.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dPointed out by the student sitting beside him, Kanata realized he fully submerged his finger in his soup.Fortunately, only that student saw his clumsy act, and Kanata breathed a sigh of relief.\u201c\u2026 Well, I shouldn\u2019t worry too much about it.\u201dFor now, he decided to concentrate on the breakfast before him.Later, after finishing breakfast, Kanata visited Maria\u2019s room again.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cKanata-sama?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dSince it was a rare opportunity, he gave the two earphones.It was only natural that it was the first time they had seen it, but they didn\u2019t even understand the principle of putting them in their ears.\u201cI found this yesterday in the artisan district. I thought it might be a pretty good item.\u201dNo.Kanata was convinced it would be the best item.He told them the item was named \u2018earphones,\u2019 how to use them, and to put it into use immediately.The girls and Kanata have their own terminals, so they decided to get started.\u201c\u2026 Haah.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dHe tried exhaling as an experiment, but it made the girls shudder greatly.Afterwards, contrary to the satisfied Kanata, the two were red in the face but somehow managed to keep their sanity.\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t describe this feeling. My ears are the happiest they\u2019ve ever been, and my nose is too hot.\u201d\u201cAh, Maria-sama, your nose is bleeding!\u201d\u201cEh? Yours, too!\u201dBecause of the two of their nosebleeds, it almost became a light murder scene.However, was it safe to say the earphones\u2019 destructive power was proven?\u201cNow all we need is a dedicated microphone. I\u2019m counting on you, Cid.\u201dWhen he gets the microphone, the perfect environment would be complete.And it was not long before the effects of these earphones were conveyed to Athena through Maria, and from there, Cid received full support.[Postscript]As for ASMR, it won\u2019t happen for a while.I think the next time it comes out will be when the setup is complete.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: A new method: Delayed StreamingKanata\u2019s second day of their stay wasn\u2019t particularly different from the day before.Maria, as a matter of course, joined Athena in the diplomatic scene, while Kanata took Mira to some high ground where they could have a panoramic view of the city.\u201cLooks wonderful.\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s very beautiful.\u201dMira, staring at the cityscape next to Kanata, was also satisfied.Now that he knew that Mira was following him, he could rest assured about not being watched most of the time if he kept her by his side.Though now Kanata was more worried about what to do with this girl with a lovely expression yet a stalker\u2019s temperament.\u201cWell, let\u2019s surprise them then!\u201d\u201cI understand!\u201dKanata came here this time with a purpose.It was to do guerrilla streaming, as he wasn\u2019t able to yesterday, nor he may be able to do so this evening.\u201cBut will it work?\u201d\u201cKukuku, I\u2019ve thought of quite a few things.\u201dKanta was in a state where he had neither a black robe nor a mask, so if he got seen, he would get exposed to his identity at that moment.To prevent this, Kanata came up with the idea of delayed streaming.It was also one of the methods of streaming he saw in his previous life and a gimmick where the video from the source is shown to the viewers a few minutes later.\u201cI\u2019ll start live, but put it on hold with magic. Then I will release the magic so the video reaches the listeners\u2019 terminals a bit late\u2026 Well, it\u2019s hard to explain, but you\u2019ll know it when you see it. Besides, I\u2019ve already tried it at Maria\u2019s terminal.\u201d\u201cI see! I don\u2019t understand well, but you\u2019re a genius, Kanata-sama!\u201d\u201cAhaha! More! Praise me more!\u201d\u201cGenius! The best! Coolest, Kanata-sama!\u201dIt was a stupid brother-and-sister-like exchange, but it was a pleasing sight.Incidentally, during this time, Mira was also deploying the presence perception she had developed as an assassin for several kilometres, always making sure that not even an animal was approaching in this vicinity.\u201cMira is really versatile. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u201cTh-thank you \u266a\u201dWiggling her body, Mira smiled happily, but her expression soon darkened, and she continued her words thus.\u201cBut when it comes to magic, I\u2019m less than an amateur\u2026\u201dKanata knows Mira boasts exceptional physical abilities, but her magical power is below par, and she has no talent whatsoever.In the first place, Mira\u2019s abilities have already helped Kanaata in the past, and they are in a realm that even those who can use magic to some extent cannot reach.\u201cDon\u2019t make that face, Mira. You\u2019re already so amazing. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d\u201cKanata-sama\u2026\u201dStalker? Creepy? But, since she\u2019s also like a cute little sister, Kanata felt the urge to speak kindly to her.While in a good mood from being flattered, Kanata wrapped his arm around Mira\u2019s back, patted her and gently stroked her head.\u201c\u2026 \u266a\u266a\u201dHer expression was full of joy. If she had a tail, it would wag vigorously.\u201cOf course, there\u2019s still a delay of about ten minutes, so we can\u2019t be like this for long. I\u2019ll make it short, and that\u2019s how our broadcast will end.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201cMira, it\u2019s short, but it\u2019s gonna be a live show. Have fun.\u201d\u201cYayyyyyy!!\u201dKanata nodded when he heard the shouts of joy.Given he was streaming as Kanata, he had some constraints and couldn\u2019t have a substantial conversation, but he wanted to make the most of the feeling of travelling and have an exciting live broadcast.He installed a camera on his portable device. It may be slightly blurred, but it couldn\u2019t be helped.\u201c\u2026 Awa\u2026 awawawa!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFor God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t get too excited and don\u2019t let your voice in, Kanata chuckled.He started the recording immediately and began with his usual opening remarks.\u201cHey everyone! We\u2019re going to do a short one today!\u201d\u201c\u2026!!! ~~~!\u201dAre you okay, Mira\u2026? Though he was worried, he decided to continue anyway.Kanata was quite motivated and knew that the important thing was to convey the excitement, the whole thing.\u201cDo you know what this view is? That\u2019s right! I\u2019m in the Principality now! Oh, it\u2019s a great country. It\u2019s beautiful, the artisan district is the best, and, above all, the food is delicious!!\u201dThe camera turned toward the view seen from there so that the listener shared the same view as Kanata.It was a little different from a live broadcast because there was no commentary, but seeing the same view this way was probably one of the most enjoyable aspects of the event.\u201cYou might have just passed me on the street! I\u2019m not wearing a black robe and a mask, and maybe you\u2019ve seen me\u2026?\u201dThere was nothing exciting about crossing paths, but his excitement was at its peak, so he said so many meaningless things happily.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time coming to a foreign country and filming it as a tourist, but I think it\u2019s a good country even if I\u2019m just a tourist. Leaving aside the problems that arose a little, the food is really delicious.\u201dGood food is important.That is because it means that crops and other resources are abundant.Of course, the food in the Kingdom is good, too, and it is hard to say which is better, but\u2026 the Kingdom may be better because it was more familiar to him.\u201cBesides\u2026\u201dThen Kanata thought of Cid, Athena, Lisa and the others.Although Athena and Lisa had heavy feelings for Haishin, they were still good people.The people who had taken care of the castle, the soldiers who had moved to save Lisa, were also friendly.\u201cThere are all kinds of people. There were people who treated me with malice, but there were also many good people who treated me well in this Principality\u2026 It\u2019s a good country, this place.\u201dSo, Kanata took a pause.If you are an influencer, you should still say this to the countries that have helped you in any way.\u201cYou guys should come to the Principality for a trip and all that! It\u2019s a wonderful country!\u201dThen, after ten minutes of talking about a few random things, Kanata finished his recording and released the magic he had used to stop the stream.Now, the broadcasting began for the people who had Haishin registered on their terminals and were holding them.\u201cMira\u2026 Mira-san?\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u266a\u201dShe had her back to Kanata and was wriggling her body in some way.When he put his hand on her shoulder, she turned around with a jerk and stood straight with her face bright red.\u201cYour face is all red\u2026?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I tried a little hard!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026?\u201dThen she got back in shape, and while carrying him in a princess hold, she took him away from there.The people who lived there, of course, with knowledge of the area, will immediately understand where that place is, so this is an escape based on that consideration.\u201cWowo!\u201d\u201cHaha, Kanata-sama is really excited today!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fun to do stuff like this. It\u2019s embarrassing to be carried like a princess by someone shorter than me, but oh well.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying? It\u2019s important to do the best you can in the role you can do at the moment. Besides\u2026 it is a lot of fun for me right now.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThey moved from building to building, happily talking to each other in this manner. Thanks to Mira\u2019s camouflage skills, also used on Kanata, they were able to travel without anyone noticing.\u201cI\u2019m going to land.\u201d\u201cOu\u2026?\u201dThe moment she landed, Mira held Kanata\u2019s body for a bit.Then, rather than the impact of landing on something solid, the feel of Mira\u2019s huge b*****s cushioned his face.Kanata and Mira then decided to walk around town together.\u201cWhat\u2019s up with them\u2026?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2014\u201dA not-so-small number of people were running in the direction where Kanta and Mira had come from. It seemed like it had turned out as they had expected.\u201cYou are very popular \u266a.\u201d\u201cRight. And I\u2019m thankful for that. Alright then, let\u2019s go exploring, Mira!\u201d\u201cYes~!\u201dAt noon, the last day of his stay in the Principality, Kanata enjoyed his time wandering around with Mira.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Let\u2019s go to the Demon Kingdom\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cGood job, Kanata-kun.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dAfter their service in the Principality was over, Kanata and the others returned to the Kingdom.Just like how they headed that way, they returned home on a graceful air trip with the help of Wyverns.\u201cHey Kanata, who is that girl?\u201d\u201cYeah, who is she? She\u2019s very pretty.\u201dThanks to Maria\u2019s arrangement, Mira joined them on their return trip.So, it was not strange that this caught the attention of his classmates, who questioned who Mira was.\u201cWho could she be\u2026 hmm?\u201dKanata tilted his head.Now that he realized it, he couldn\u2019t find the right words to clearly tell people who don\u2019t know that Mira is a certain type of person.\u201cShe\u2019s like a friend.\u201d\u201cHeh.\u201d\u201cIn that case\u2026 well, never mind.\u201dAs they had suspected something, they didn\u2019t inquire much. They were good people.It was already evening, so they all decided to part here, and his classmates to their dormitories.\u201cThen I\u2019ll excuse myself first. I\u2019ve to Alphana that\u2026 Ara.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cThis sign\u2026\u201dMaria noticed something, so Kanata followed her gaze.There was a girl there dressed in a white robe, a figure that Kanata had missed in a sense.\u201cAlphana?\u201dYes, she had the same appearance as when he first met her.Maria and Mira weren\u2019t on guard because they knew she was Alphana.When Kanata called her name, she removed her hood and revealed her beautiful face to the moonlight.\u201cWelcome back, everyone.\u201dShe said this with a smile.As it was, she approached slowly and held Kanata\u2019s hand in a natural motion.\u201c\u2026 Umm.\u201d\u201c?\u201dKanata was puzzled. He tilted his head and wondered what happened.\u201cAh, sorry. I just\u2026\u201dSaying that Alphana removed her hand and shyly stuck out her tongue.It was an overly flirtatious gesture, but it was something that Kanata never saw from Alphana, so Kanata\u2019s cheeks turned a little red.\u201cWell, two days\u2026 it\u2019s not that long, but it\u2019s been a while\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Fufu \u266a.\u201dAlphana\u2019s smile deepened further when she saw Kanata looking embarrassed.\u201c\u2026 Muu.\u201d\u201cI see. This certainly tickles my fancy.\u201dMaria looked a little regretful, and Mira wrote various things in her notebook, saying it was a learning experience.Maria and Alphana then headed back toward the girls\u2019 dormitory, and when their backs left his sight, Kanata gasped.\u201cI forgot to give Alphana the earphones.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Well, good thing that now she\u2019ll live a little longer.\u201dIt was natural for Kanata to ask what that meant.\u201cThen, Kanata-sama, I\u2019ll take my leave now.\u201d\u201cAh, really, thank you for everything, Mira.\u201d\u201cNo problem! See you! Shuwacchi!\u201dMira disappeared as she took off into the sky.In fact, the catchphrase now was \u2018shuwacchi,\u2019 but that\u2019s something that Kanata liked when he used to read stories with special effects.[TLN: No idea about this \u3057\u3085\u308f\u3063\u3061 thing.][EDN: A sound effect, I think: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoDhHWYR6_Q Note: It\u2019s loud.]\u201c\u2026 I wonder if that special effects thing is still around.\u201dIn the past, he remembered he used to play with his friends saying \u2018shuwacchi.\u2019\u201cAll right, I\u2019d better be on my way.\u201dThen Kanata also started walking toward the dormitory.The trip to the Principality was not only a great experience for Kanata, but also an encounter with a friend who will aid his future development as Haishin.\u201cWell, I talked with Cid\u2026 he seemed happy to be busy.\u201dHe visited Cid\u2019s store once before leaving. He was quite busy, partly because of Athena\u2019s arrangement.He said he would make the microphone he asked for in no time.Athena\u2019s concern for a mere commoner was surely not to the liking of the other nobles, but Athena was also firmly committed to taking care of Cid.\u201cWell, ASMR is more like a limited or targeted way of sending magic to those who desire it rather than just broadcasting it.\u201dBuilding a system for targeted streams or sending it to those who want it is important, you know?There are still many people in this world who don\u2019t know what ASMR is, and to be honest, while he thinks they were well-made, it\u2019s also embarrassing.\u201cMen will definitely think it\u2019s disgusting, so it\u2019s probably better to limit it to women.\u201dKanata nodded to make adjustments in that direction.\u201cWell, first of all, the microphone has to be finished\u2014\u201dKanata\u2019s words stopped there.He had bumped into a woman who appeared out of nowhere.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe woman was Shrouza, with jet-black hair that melted into the darkness.Unlike Alphana, she appeared out of thin air and without warning, like Mira, and it surprised him.\u201cLong time no see, Kanata,\u201d\u201cYeah, long time no see, Shrouza.\u201dAlthough it hadn\u2019t been that long, he felt a sense of nostalgia.Shrouza, a woman over 180 cm tall, stood out with her beauty and attracted a lot of attention.\u201cHm, it\u2019s a bit annoying with all the stares.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cIn that case, let\u2019s do this.\u201dWith a snap, Schloza snapped her fingers.Then, a barrier was formed around them, cutting them off from the outside world, and the gazes directed at them disappeared.\u201cAh, is it magic that kills the presence?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s been a while, so I want to talk slowly.\u201d\u201cI see. Haha, I feel the same way.\u201dKanata was in the same mood to talk since it had been a while since they had seen each other.As the streets gradually grew darker and fewer people passed by, Kanata made a slip of the tongue.\u201cHey Shrouza, this has been in my mind for a while\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cIs it easy to go to the Demon Kingdom?\u201d\u201cEasy to go? Wanna come?\u201d\u201cEhh\u2026\u201dIt was just a thought, but apparently, Shrouza was giving off the vibe that she was serious about it.The academy would be closed tomorrow, so that was not a problem\u2026But once again, from a human perspective, the place called the Demon Kingdom was both intriguing and slightly scary.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. I\u2019ll be by your side.\u201dWith her hand on her waist and chest held high, she appeared to be someone who could be relied on.Kanata nodded his head with a light heart, thinking it would be okay if her overwhelming aura was strong enough to give the illusion of it having a colour.\u201cWhat about school for you tomorrow, Kanata?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a holiday.\u201d\u201cThen you can stay at my mansion.\u201d\u201cIs that okay? I mean, it\u2019s decided all of a sudden.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s in the Demon Kingdom. I rule.\u201d\u201cEeh\u2026?\u201dWhere did that confidence come from\u2026? Kanata was worried.They entered an alleyway lined with buildings on both. A magic circle encircled Kanata and Shrouza.\u201c\u2026 Wait a minute, there\u2019s something I need to do first.\u201d\u201cHm~n?\u201dPutting her finger to her forehead, Shrouza used some magic.It caused the magic to flow from Shrouza like a ripple spreading out as if Shloza was communicating her thoughts to a wide area.\u201cNow it\u2019s all right. Fufufu! Then let\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cO-ou!\u201dThe decision to go to the Demon Kingdom was made, albeit abruptly.Wrapped in dazzling light, Kanata transferred to the Demon Kingdom instantly, embraced by Shuroza.\u201c\u2026 Wow.\u201dWhat spread out before Kanata\u2019s eyes was a different world.The sky was red, and the buildings were mostly made of dark and ominous materials\u2026 It was the land where the demons lived.\u201c\u2026 is this the Demon Kingdom?\u201d\u201cYeah. This is where I live.\u201dEven though the Demon Kingdom was considered a place where one could not enter and survive, Kanata stepped into it.Kanata did have some doubts, but he did not intend to doubt Shrouza, who had gone as far as to join his support group.\u201cAh, My Lo\u2014\u201dAt that moment, someone called out, but their figure vanished right after.He was slightly concerned about Shrouza\u2019s fist swinging through the air, but she smiled and said not to worry about it.Thus, Kanata stepped into the Demon Kingdom for the first time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: I\u2019m curious! But\u2026\u201c\u2026 Will he be okay?\u201d\u201cMm. Demons are sturdy, so he\u2019ll be fine.\u201dKanata opened his mouth as he looked at the blown-away demon and wondered if that was the problem.By the way, all the demons that Kanata and Shrouza were currently looking at had wings and horns, but Kanata was unsure about their species.(\u2026 Whoa. There are so many with wings and horns\u2026 but I don\u2019t think I can say for sure from what race this one is from or that one\u2026 Ah!)Despite their differences in physique, almost all demons share similarities in horns and wings, so Kanata had no idea how to differentiate their race.In the midst of all this, Kanata found an all-too-obvious presence.\u201cHey, Shrouza! Is that a cyclops?\u201d\u201cHmm? Yeah.\u201dKanata turned his attention to the first giant.He was much taller than Kanata, perhaps as much as three metres.It would seem that if such a being were to attack a human, they wouldn\u2019t be able to block it\u2026 However, the cyclops turned its eyes from Kanata to Shrouza and quickly looked away.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Kanata, are you more interested in that big thing than me?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dShrouza muttered with an uninteresting face.Kanata was interested not only in cyclops but also in other demons. However, he intuitively felt that if he paid too much attention to other things, Shrouza\u2019s mood would turn bad, so Kanata shook his head.\u201cNo, but please understand me. For me\u2026 No, for humans, the Demon Kingdom is truly an unknown area. Of course, I\u2019d want to see various things.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is that so? Then\u2026 You, come here.\u201d\u201c!?!?\u201dWhen Shuroza called out, the cyclops trembled significantly.It seemed as if his red eye had become teary, and the other demons around pitifully looked at the cyclops.(\u2026 Shrouza, you\u2019re definitely hiding something.)While glancing at Shrouza\u2019s beautiful profile, Kanata thought so.The Demon Kingdom is a place where the Demon King rules, and is it okay for Kanata to enter there at Shrouza\u2019s discretion?Furthermore, the demons around that make Kanata feel a sense of fear towards Shrouza\u2026 Kanata reached the hypothesis that far.(The demon tribe just said \u2018My Lo\u2014\u2019 Was it for the Demon King?)The absolute ruler of the demons, Shrouza\u2026 could she be? As he was thinking, the cyclops came before him with a loud noise.\u201c\u2026 Ohh so big.\u201d\u201cW-What do you want?\u201dThe cyclops that stood before him was indeed big when he saw it up close.It was strange, though, as he seemed afraid of Shrouza, so his presence felt very small.\u201cAre you okay\u2026?\u201dWhen he asked that question, the cyclops stared at Kanata as if he felt somewhat moved and then was startled again by Shrouza\u2019s words.\u201cAm I that scary? I\u2019m just doing what I normally do, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cHiiii!\u201dApparently, he was quite scared.Now that it came to this, Kanata felt more apologetic for calling him.\u201cUm\u2026 I just wanted to take a closer look, it\u2019s okay now.\u201dKanata said that, took Shuroza\u2019s hand, and walked away.He didn\u2019t want to trouble the cyclops anymore, but more than anything, as Kanata, he wanted to clarify his doubts for a while now.\u201cShrouza\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too sudden, Shrouza-sama. I feel sorry for them.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u2014Are you the Demon King?Just as Kanata was about to utter the core words, a voice interrupted him\u2026 and Kanata naturally turned his eyes in that direction, then quickly turned his face away.\u201cLucia!\u201dSo Shrouza called the woman.Now, the reason why Kanata turned away so vigorously was because of the woman\u2019s outfit.She had the same jet-black hair as Shrouza, and the horns and wings unique to demons were still fine.On the other hand, her clothes could technically be called clothes, but they were very lacking in that area.(Those are just strings\u2026 What\u2019s with her? Is she a str*pper!?)It was not covering her chest and thighs the least, like a string of underwear.It could be said that its only purpose was to show her beautifully charming body line, and Kanata, as a man, certainly felt the desire to stare at her\u2026 But that desire was blown away by the overwhelming sexiness that woman exuded.\u201c\u2026 Ah, that\u2019s right. I think this is too much for you.\u201dAs if noticing Kanata\u2019s state, the woman immediately changed into a dress.The dress was jet black, the same colour as her hair, and it suited her very well as it exuded an irresistible charm.Afterwards, Shrouza reflected on the chaos she had caused in the Demon Kingdom by being talked down to by Lucia, and Kanata heard what had happened.\u201c\u2026 So that\u2019s what happened. There\u2019s no need to worry about it.\u201d\u201cMuu\u2026 I was worried that if Kanata knew I was the Demon King, he would act differently.\u201dAlthough this was sudden, when Kanata was about to come to the Demon Kingdom, Shrouza spread the word throughout the land using her magic.The content of the message was that anyone who showed hostility toward Kanata would not be forgiven and that even just telling or hinting that Shrouza was the Demon King was worthy of death.\u2026 But still, if Shrouza appeared in front of them as Demon King, they would have no choice but to call her that.The demon who was punched and sent flying earlier was truly unlucky.\u201c\u2026 I did something bad.\u201dKanata thought the Demon Kingdom would have remained peaceful if he hadn\u2019t made the suggestion, but Lucia reassured him that everything was okay.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. The demon that got punched and sent flying is quite a m*******t, so he passed out while having a climax.\u201d\u201cWha\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 How weird? I never knew that before.\u201dIn this case, perhaps climax means that way.\u2026 And a lot happened, but now that they both knew that Shrouza was the Demon King and Kanata was Haishin, they didn\u2019t need to hide anything strange.And as it started getting dark, Kanata was immediately invited to the Demon King\u2019s castle.\u201c\u2026 Is this the infamous castle?\u201dIn one word, it was solid.The Capital\u2019s royal palace had a sturdy construction, and the walls to protect against outside attacks were also on a tremendous scale, but this castle exceeded that.As Kanata stared blankly at the building, Lucia placed her hand on his back.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201dKanata felt her hand on his back and felt a strange sensation even though it was just a touch.He walked around the castle, not understanding what it was, while Shrouza said she had some business to attend to and left the two behind, disappearing somewhere.\u201cShe went to give instructions to her subordinates, and the moment Kanata-sama returned from the Principality, the Demon King skipped out of the meeting.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dIn the meantime, while Shrouza was absent, Lucia showed her true self to Kanata while spending time with Kanata.\u201c\u2026 phew. Still, I\u2019m having a hard time with the Demon King. I don\u2019t blame her, but for her to suddenly disappear while discussing the budget is just\u2026\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 is that how you normally talk, Lucia-san?\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019m like this, but my people tell me to talk more like a girl.\u201d\u201cHeh\u2026 I like it, though.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cO-ou..\u201dLucia approached Kanata with a grin, but Kanata took a step back.She then coughed and apologized before bowing her head again.\u201cLet me introduce myself once again. My name is Lucia, a succubus, and I am a big fan of Haishin-sama.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Thanks for that.\u201dAs soon as Kanata heard her introduction, he realized the meaning behind her seductive aura.\u201c\u2026 A succubus, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah. Do you remember, Kanata-sama, when you talked about succubus on your stream?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dThat was a memory of something too embarrassing to mention.The fact that he talked about the Demon King on his stream meant that he also talked about what kind of beings the demon race was.He also talked about succubi, as they were rumoured to be very erotic and beautiful older women, as he put it.\u201cWell, that\u2026 um \u2026 \u201c\u201cWhy are you embarrassed? Other succubi and I were happy to hear those words, and there is no succubus who does not get wet from being told that by someone they are infatuated with, you know.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata\u2019s face turned red, and he looked down.Through talking with Lucia, Kanata understood that because she is a succubus, she has no hesitation whatsoever about talking dirty or anything of that nature, so she spoke directly and honestly without hiding anything.\u201cAnd I\u2019ve told everyone that if I ever get to know you, I\u2019ll give you the greatest possible welcome.\u201d\u201c\u2026 W-what does that mean?\u201d\u201cIt means we\u2019ll fill a bed with succubus girls and invite you there to provide a dream-like experience. Although, knowing it is Haishin-sama, some girls might faint from happiness, but still.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata couldn\u2019t help but swallow hard.However, he was still a bit of a coward in these types of situations, so he couldn\u2019t bring himself to be swayed by desire.\u201cHey, f*cking b*tch, don\u2019t embarrass our guest.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah?\u201dAnother voice suddenly rang out.This time it was a man\u2019s voice, but because she was called a b*tch, Lucia\u2019s killing intent exploded.When Kanata turned his eyes to the source of the voice, he saw the demon who had taken away Aguila.\u201cYo! It\u2019s been a long time, huh?\u201dKanata finally got to meet him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: The Demon King and the Goddess\u201c\u2026 Umm.\u201dKanata was in a panic as he watched the two demons in front of him glaring at each other.The succubus, Lucia, and the man with impressive wings on his back exuded intimidating fighting auras as if they were imposing their presence on each other.\u201c\u2026 Shrouza, please come back\u2026\u201d\u201cSorry to keep you waiting.\u201d\u201c!?\u201dKanata was surprised when he got tapped on the shoulder. It was definitely Shrouza standing behind him.She glared at the two who had caused Kanata to panic.At that moment, something tremendous attacked them, avoiding Kanata.\u201c!?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Tch.\u201dLucia quickly knelt on the ground, but the man reluctantly knelt, making a tongue-clicking noise.\u201cWhy did you guys bother Kanata?\u201d\u201cThis moron\u2014\u201d\u201cThis b*tch\u2014\u201d\u201cAn?\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d\u201c\u2026You two.\u201dDespite being afraid in her presence, the two started to provoke each other again, forgetting about Shrouza and got ready to fire at each other once more.Shrouza put her hand on her forehead, sighed, and decided to pin them both to the ground while they stared at each other.The ground caved in with a huge sound, but the two still kept their composure.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll start by introducing myself. My name is Garula, and I\u2019m one of the birdmen.\u201d\u201cBirdman\u2026 like a bird-human?\u201d\u201cYeah, something like that.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d replied Gurura with a fresh smile.Even though he gave off a bad feeling, his smile had a sense of trustworthiness.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s unexpected that I can talk to Haishin like this\u2026 Oh, it\u2019s not a stream. Maybe I should call you Kanata.\u201dIt was not only trustworthiness but also a sense of familiarity.\u201cGarula and Lucia shall go no further. I will guide Kanata myself the rest of the way.\u201d\u201cHa? Does that mean you\u2019re claiming Kanata-sama all for yourself?\u201d\u201cOi-oi, I\u2019d like to talk to Kanata too, you know?\u201dKanata couldn\u2019t believe how popular he had become and chuckled.In the end, since Shrouza allowed them to have dinner together, they spent a little more time together.\u201cI realized it at that time, and I told Your Majesty\u2026 But geez, even though it\u2019s thanks to me, you left to see him alone.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just wanted to keep him to myself.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s even worse.\u201d\u201cI think that\u2019s unfair.\u201d\u201cGrrr.\u201dIt was really lively at dinner time at Shrouza\u2019s castle.Kanata would just answer when someone asked him something, and the rest of the time, they would chat and tease each other, making it enjoyable to watch.\u201c\u2026\u201dEven so, the food in front of Kanata was strange but guaranteed to be delicious\u2026(Wow\u2026 I don\u2019t know what kind of creature it is, but this giant eyeball is delicious.)Despite the smooth taste spreading in his mouth, Kanata was given the precious experience of eating with an indescribable feeling.\u201cOkay, then, Kanata.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go take a bath.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201dHe thought he had misheard her, but apparently not.However, Garula insisted that it was normal for humans to bathe separately for men and women, so he somehow managed to avoid the situation of being with them.Although it was called a bath, it was truly a luxuriously large bath, and in the wide bath, Kanata had Garula wash his back.\u201cFor a man, you have an unblemished body.\u201d\u201cMost people don\u2019t have that many scars.\u201dGurula\u2019s body was covered with scars as if he was a warrior with a long battle history.Furthermore, his body was larger than Kanata\u2019s, which made him look like a man you could count on.\u201cI never thought I\u2019d be the one to wash a human\u2019s back like this. It\u2019s a rare experience, but it\u2019s not bad.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a valuable experience for me, too\u2026 Well, it looks like I won\u2019t be able to live today.\u201d\u201cRight. But I didn\u2019t miss the Principality one.\u201d\u201cReally? It\u2019s a wonderful country.\u201d\u201cI see. How about the Demon Kingdom?\u201dKanata nodded at Garula\u2019s words.\u201cI still don\u2019t know much about it, but I think it\u2019s a warm place. I guess it\u2019s because we can meet and talk like this.\u201d\u201cI see. That\u2019s good to know.\u201dIf there was no enmity between humans and the demon race, it wouldn\u2019t be strange for them to come and go to each other\u2019s places.Of course, not all humans and demons are like this, but as Kanata, he still hopes for such a fairy tale.\u201cWell, I\u2019m off then.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d\u201cJust when I thought they\u2019d given up, they came along.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dGarula said as he stood up and soaked in the water.As he was relaxing at the edge of the hot water, the door suddenly opened, and two ladies appeared.\u201cMm, does it feel good, Kanata?\u201d\u201c\u2026 From what I can see from his expression, he\u2019s enjoying it, Your Majesty.\u201dShrouza and Lucia came to Kanata\u2019s side with nothing on their bodies but their bare skin.Naturally, the fact that they were not wearing any clothes meant that their b*****s and most importantly, their waist and below were all in full view. Kanata involuntarily looked away.\u201cH-how did you get in here?\u201d\u201cBecause I wanted to bathe with you!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dAfter that, Kanata soaked in the water with the two of them surrounding him.If he thinks about it, aside from his family, this was probably the first time he\u2019s been in close proximity to females while naked.Both of them had exceptional figures and were beautiful to the point where it was not painful to look at them, and one of them was even a succubus.(\u2026 This is bad. They didn\u2019t notice, right?)Kanata was trying to make himself as small as possible and not let anyone know about his body\u2019s honest reaction, but\u2026 did Kanata not realize there was a professional here on this kind of thing?\u201cI never thought I\u2019d get to soak in hot water with Kanata like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s right.\u201dShrouza didn\u2019t seem to notice anything and just happily expressed her joy.She scooped up some water with her hand, and the way she draped it over her shoulder was quite seductive.But Kanata still couldn\u2019t focus on her because\u2026 he couldn\u2019t stop feeling the sensation of Lucia\u2019s fingers brushing against his shoulder.\u201cIf her majesty wasn\u2019t here, I would have been the one to do it, but of course, if I did that, I would get killed, so please forgive me.\u201dIn that sense, Lucia-san was talking about life and death, and Kanata was crying in his mind.Of course, nothing went beyond the line, and the bath time ended safely.Apparently, Garula went up first and left a note on Kanata\u2019s clothes.\u201cI\u2019m going now. So long Kanata, let\u2019s talk again.\u201dThe characters were from the human world, perhaps freshly learned, and looked like worms crawling on the ground.\u201c\u2026 He\u2019s a good guy, seriously.\u201dIt was the moment when he felt the guy-to-guy friendship that he had felt with Cid, and it was indeed a moment of a budding friendship.\u201cAll that\u2019s left to do is sleep. Kanata, let\u2019s sleep together.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201d\u201cUmu\u201dShrouza looked at Kanata curiously, wondering if she had said something strange.Lucia, who was by her side, chuckled, mouthed the words, \u201cI guess that\u2019s it for today,\u201d and left.\u201cDemons have a lot of freedom.\u201d\u201cFreedom. There are no strict rules for us.\u201dThe demon world seems to be free. That\u2019s what Kanata wrote in his dictionary.As Shrouza mentioned, all that was left to do was to go to bed, but Kanata, so tired, fell asleep immediately on the large bed that belonged to Shrouza.It is not strange for Kanata to be so mentally exhausted after returning from the Principality and immediately embarking on a journey to the Demon Kingdom.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Demon King Shrouza stared at Kanata\u2019s face with a blush.\u201cShould I kiss him now or do something more intense\u2026 No, but I can\u2019t do that without his consent,\u201d So she shook her head.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, so why not?\u201d \u201cNo, don\u2019t do it!\u201d\u00a0The white girl and the black girl were jostling in Shrouza\u2019s brain.[EDN: This is a reference to having a good and evil version in her mind, but not good vs evil, and demon vs angel would be odd for a demon.]In the end, Shrouza didn\u2019t touch Kanata and just watched him sleep beside her.She then closed her eyes and shouted\u2026\u201cWho are you?\u201dShe immediately created a barrier to protect Kanata and glared into the void.She looked defenceless in her negligee, but she was not. She was an overwhelmingly strong woman.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201dIt was the goddess Isla who appeared.Shrouza, the Demon King, was on high alert as she got surrounded by light that defeated the darkness around her.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not fair, you Demon King! You Stupid! Big fool!\u201dWith that, Isla disappeared.Shrouza, who was left behind, blurted out a few words.\u201c\u2026 Who was that woman?\u201dThat\u2019s all she could say.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: Still a cherry on the stairway to adulthood\u201cHey Kanata, why don\u2019t you stay in the Demon Kingdom forever?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do that, sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Muu.\u201dKanata headed for the Demon Kingdom as soon as he returned from the Principality, but of course, he had his own place to live and must return home.Even though he had the fortune of waking up in the morning in Shrouza\u2019s chest, just like yesterday, Shrouza, Lucia and Garula were also by his side.\u201cNext time, I hope you\u2019ll come to the mansion where the succubi live. I promise you the best hospitality.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go there, Kanata. It\u2019s true that those succubi, including this b*tch, are in the category you can endure, but they\u2019ll probably captivate you to the core of your bones.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? We succubi are\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already decided it\u2019s no good.\u201d\u201c\u2026 yes.\u201dScolded by Shrouza, Lucia became sad.Kanata laughed at their usual exchange and decided to make this kind of proposal.\u201cNext time\u2026 Can I bring some of my acquaintances?\u201d\u201cYou mean Alphana and Maria? I welcome them.\u201dKanata smiled. Apparently, she was in welcoming mode, which was good.After that, Kanata was transferred back to the Kingdom with Shrouza\u2019s magic and immediately returned to the dormitory.\u201c\u2026 Something like that happened, huh.\u201dSince he was used to being in his room a lot of the time, returning to the dormitory room after a few days felt somewhat nostalgic for Kanata.Feeling at home in a place that had not changed since he left for the Principality, Kanata jumped and dove into bed.\u201cThis is it\u2026 this is what makes me feel at home.\u201dEven though Athena\u2019s mansion bed was comfortable, his own bed was truly where he could feel at ease.A faint, sweet scent lingered on his bed, but he didn\u2019t pay it much attention and just became one with his bed.\u201cI\u2019m not going to stream today. If I hadn\u2019t gone to the Demon Kingdom, I would\u2019ve just gone to bed last night like usual.\u201dHe felt bad for his listeners waiting for him, but his curiosity to visit the Demon Kingdom couldn\u2019t be denied.He thought of leaving out some parts of the exchange at the castle with Shrouza and Lucia, etc. because there were some things that were embarrassing, but he will tell them that the Demon Kingdom was a good place to live.\u201c\u2026 that was fun, seriously.\u201dComparing it to Kingdom may not be fair, but he might say that the Demon Kingdom had better public order.That\u2019s partly because Shrouza\u2019s governance was strong, and the presence of trustworthy subordinates like Lucia and Garula was probably a big factor.\u201c\u2026 even so.\u201dKanata recalled waking up in the morning with his face buried in the bed.Earlier, one would say he was surprised to see Shrouza\u2019s b*****s in front of him but was, in fact, not. Now, in his slightly drowsy state, he actually reached out, wondering what it was.\u201c\u2026 Oppa\u2014!\u201d\u201cAmu\u2026 Kanataa?\u201dHe had touched Alphana\u2019s and Mira\u2019s b*****s by accident. This was the first time he had felt them directly with his hands.\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s just say it was just a dream.\u201dThe knowledge that dreams were packed with natural instincts is something he learned from textbooks, but Kanata nodded, thinking that it was exactly as described.As he was 17, he couldn\u2019t help but have such feelings, and it was only natural for him to be more conscious when he touched it with his hands.\u201cLet\u2019s go outside.\u201dFeeling that it wouldn\u2019t be good to stay in the room alone, Kanata quickly stood up.Once outside, Kanata headed for the main street lined with stalls where he usually buys and eats, a lively and bustling place, especially since it was early in the morning.\u201cNothing much difference in the Capital City and the Demon Kingdom. Peace, peace.\u201dThough, conflicts never go away, neither in the past life nor the present.But now, there were no outbreaks of battles with demons, and miraculously there were no conflicts between countries either.\u201cKingdom, Empire, and Principality are rich in many ways and are unlikely to fight with each other. But other small countries and countries that do not interact with each other are different. Even small disputes can turn into big ones, so diplomacy is important in this sense.\u201dHe recalled such words said by a teacher.Hopefully, there would be no major conflicts, which was what everyone and Kanata in this era wanted.\u201c\u2026 Ah?\u201dAs Kanata was eating skewers from a street vendor, he saw a familiar scene that gave him a feeling of deja vu.\u201cHey, what do you say? Please, come with me,\u201d a man said.\u201cIf you want that, come to the shop. Follow proper order, please.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have the money to buy you for a night. Come on,\u201d the man insisted.\u201cYou\u2019re persistent. Get your hands off me.\u201dKanna was involved with a man who was not in good shape.It seemed she could not escape as she got gripped by the wrist. Kanna\u2019s gaze was filled with contempt.Unlike before, Kanna got protected by guards, and she quickly left the man\u2019s grip.\u201cFine. Just leave me. I\u2019ll leave.\u201d\u201cIf you go any further, I\u2019ll have you thrown in jail.\u201dThe man got taken away, and Kanna rubbed her wrist and sighed.Normally he would have just passed by without caring, but since he knew Kanna, he approached her with concern.\u201cYou alright?\u201d\u201cOh, Kanata-kun?\u201dThe moment she saw Kanata, her sharp gaze immediately changed to a softer one.It was common for such fights to happen, but the number of soldiers patrolling increased because of incidents like this.\u201cI think he grabbed you by the wrist?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yeah, but it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\u201c?\u201dKanna looked down with a slight tinge on her cheeks.She seemed embarrassed about something, but unfortunately, Kanata couldn\u2019t figure out the meaning behind her expression and just tilted his head.For some reason, Kanata felt like Kanna was shaking her shoulders every time he spoke, but he couldn\u2019t quite understand why.\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dKanna noticed something and approached Kanata. And then she murmured, \u201cThis scent\u2026\u201d\u201cKanna-san?\u201d\u201cKanata-kun, what are your plans for today?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have anything in particular\u2026\u201d\u201cThen can you give me some of your time?\u201dKanata nodded to Kanna\u2019s proposal since he didn\u2019t have any plans. Then, they headed to the building where Kanna works, a brothel, and entered through the back door to avoid being noticed.\u201cOya Kanna\u2026 and the guest from the other day.\u201d\u201cYeah, hello.\u201dAs they passed by the owner, Kanata headed to Kanna\u2019s room.This was the second time he entered her room, but he still didn\u2019t understand the significance of entering the room of a high-class courtesan like her.It wasn\u2019t just a physical relationship, but something deeper.\u201cKanata-kun, do you know what it means for a prostitute to let a man into her room?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2026\u201d\u201cFufu, well, that\u2019s okay.\u201dWhen a prostitute deals with a customer, they use a room that is kept clean and can be reached quickly in case of an emergency, but generally, people do not enter privately owned rooms.\u201cIt means they trust. As for the rest, you\u2019ll see\u2026\u201d\u201cWha-!\u201dKanata\u2019s heart pounded at the whispered words.The memory of the morning with Shrouza and the excitement felt with the succubus, Lucia, was surpassed by something else.(Kanna-san is supposed to be human. What is this erotic feeling\u2026 Such a high-class technique!)Well, even if she didn\u2019t have the title of a high-class courtesan, anyone would be thrilled by Kanna, whose every movement arouses a man\u2019s lust.\u201cAre you excited?\u201dApparently seeing through him, Kanna stood before Kanata as she said this.\u201cUfufu \u266a.\u201d\u201cKanna-san!\u201dStanding in front of her, Kanna closed the distance to Kanata and sat on his legs.As for Kanata, he couldn\u2019t escape because he was sitting on the sofa, and just in front of her were Kanna\u2019s melons.\u201cHey Kanata-kun, why don\u2019t you let this lady take care of everything?\u201cAh, um\u2026\u201dHis brain seemed to melt when she whispered sweetly.\u2018You should just give in to those words. Only happiness awaits you,\u2019\u00a0whispered something hidden deep in his heart.Sometime later, Kanata came out of the room.Naturally, the owner, passing by, saw the moment, but Kanata, in a daze, did not notice.\u201cFumu, Kanna seems to like him a lot.\u201dOf course, he didn\u2019t hear that muttering.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cKanata-kun, you\u2019ll fall if you keep spacing out like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah.\u201dKanata finally came to himself when he reached the back entrance.It was said that brothels are places where customers are shown dreams and offered healing, and Kanata recalled how fluffy it was like a dream.But once it was over, he felt strangely calm.\u201cKanata-kun, sometimes healing is really necessary, you see? This isn\u2019t something dirty, but a time to heal your heart.\u201d\u201c\u2026 that.\u201d\u201cNext time, be sure to be ready for the real thing, okay?\u201dLaughing mischievously, Kanna waved her hand and returned to the building.Kanata continued to stare at the door for a while, even after Kanna was out of sight, then finally started to walk away.\u201c\u2026 it was amazing.\u201dSuddenly, he understood a little bit about what it was like for a man to be addicted to a brothel.Well, it was good to know that it was a time to heal the soul, though not to the point of devoting one\u2019s life to it.\u201cWhat was so great?\u201d\u201cWell, of course\u2026 huh?\u201dDue to being too absorbed, he didn\u2019t even notice someone else was there.Although he thought he recognized the voice, he turned to see who it was and saw\u2014\u201cGood day, Kanata-sama. it\u2019s a coincidence to meet in a place like this, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAlphana stood there, wearing the same white robe as the one from the night before.She looked at Kanata with an adoring smile. Her beauty was too much to bear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: Love (V2- END)\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cFufu \u266a.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an ambush!\u201d \u201cEnemy attack!\u201dSuch alarms were ringing in Kanata\u2019s head.\u201cYaa, Alphana.\u201d\u201cYes \u266a Hello, Kanata-sama\u2026\u201dIt was a very beautiful smile. That smile was so holy that it purified everything stagnant in one\u2019s mind.However, Kanata wondered if it was his imagination that he was feeling somewhat pressured by her smile and kept his mouth tugged back.\u201c\u2026 Erm.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did you do something you can\u2019t tell me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe could say that he did and that something he did was naughty, but as Kanata, there was no way he could say that with stupid honesty.There was no way he could tell her that I had tasted a glimpse of Kanna\u2019s technique as he was carried away by the mood because she was a classmate before she was a saint.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to embarrass you.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dWith her hand on her chin, Alphana smiled and looked around before saying,\u201cAre you free now? Would you like to spend some time together?\u201d\u201cSure, I don\u2019t mind. But is it okay for you, Alphana?\u201d\u201cYes, I have some free time.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go together then.\u201dSo, it was decided that he would spend some time with Alphana.He had walked around town with Alphana many times since they met, but thinking about it again, she behaved quite differently from what he imagined a saint to be.\u201cHey, Alphana.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI thought saints were supposed to be a little less free. Basically, they would stay in secrecy, or rather, they are strictly protected\u2026 sometimes they are sent into battle.\u201dThat was Kanata\u2019s understanding of a saint.Even in the novels and manga he read, the existence called Saint was special enough that it was difficult for them to even go out alone\u2026 He thought that way.\u201cCertainly, there are aspects like that, but that\u2019s something from long ago. At least for me, I spend my time freely, and that is recognized by both the church and royal family.\u201dKanata nodded his head.Although she is indeed a saint\u2014a special one\u2014, he was relieved to see that she apparently is not as restricted as Kanata had imagined.Alphana chuckled at the sight of Kanata.\u201cAre you worried about me?\u201d\u201cWell, yeah.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m happy.\u201dPerhaps not only Kanata but other people would also say similar things.Even so, Alphana seemed as if she would say that Kanata\u2019s words made her the happiest and smiled.\u201cKanata-sama, would you like to go somewhere a little more private?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dAlphana led him to the shade of a large tree.The benches were just recently placed, making it an exquisite resting spot, and there were few people around, so it was comfortably quiet.\u201cKanata-sama, would you like a lap pillow?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201dKanata was taken aback by Alphana\u2019s tapping on her lap, but he could not shake his head at her eyes staring at him.Kanata gingerly laid his body down and rested his head in her lap.The shade of the trees blocked the sun\u2019s rays, so there was no glare even when he was on my back like this\u2026 And best of all, the softness he felt on his head and the spectacular view in front of him.\u201cIt\u2019s just the two of us like this. May I ask you a few questions?\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dKanata nodded to Alphana about asking any questions she wanted because there was basically not that much to be asked.Alphana pretended to think about it but quickly continued her words.\u201cWhat made you decide to stream, Kanata-sama?\u201d\u201c\u2026 hmm.\u201dWhy did he decide to do the streaming? It was simply because he wanted to do it.And to be even more precise, he only started for that reason because he yearned to be a streamer in his previous life.\u201cI wanted to do it, so I guess\u2026\u201dIt was too easy an answer, but Alphana nodded in understanding.He thought she would ask for more details, but she didn\u2019t and gently stroked Kanata\u2019s head.Alphana\u2019s tenderness conveyed through the palm of her hand made Kanata feel a sense of receptivity.\u201cBut even so, it\u2019s still embarrassing for me to have people like Alphana know that I was talking recklessly before.\u201d\u201cHaha, but I don\u2019t think you said anything wrong. You should have more confidence in yourself,\u201d Alphana said with a smile.Alphana\u2019s words were full of affirmation for everything that Kanata had said. She never rejected him and her kindness always allowed her to understand whatever he said. Though not everything she said was positive, if Kanata said something wrong, she would tell him.\u201cKanata-sama, would you mind listening to me as well?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dKanata nodded pleasantly.The warm sunshine, the flowery scent emanating from Alphana, and the feeling of her stroking his head made him want to nap.But Kanata was trying his best not to fall asleep.\u201cI am glad I got to know you, Haishin-sama, and most of all, I am very happy to have met you, Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Alphana?\u201dAlphana\u2019s voice was serious for a moment.\u201cI\u2019m glad I got to know you,\u201d she said with a hint of sadness as if foreshadowing a goodbye.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. Did I make you think of something strange just now?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that?\u201d\u201cI see. I should have chosen my words more carefully. I\u2019ll never leave your side, okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHearing it straight like this made Kanata feel embarrassed. And it seemed like Alphana\u2019s previous words were not intended to hint at a bad future or to raise any flags.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cI just wanted to tell you a lot of things while we have the chance.\u201dAs Alphana lowered her gaze, she and Kanata\u2019s gaze met. Despite the large bulge of her chest, which was both good and bad, in a way, Alphana continued speaking while looking into his eyes.\u201cI initially had feelings towards Haishin-sama, but after actually meeting and spending a few months together, I\u2019ve come to know more about Kanata-sama, and I want to know more about you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata could not look away from Alphana.Her words are so imprinted in Kanata\u2019s mind that they invade his ears in a pleasant way.\u201cTo me, the existence of Kanata-sama is endlessly mysterious while also feeling like someone from a different world. The innovative concept of broadcasting, your actual objective perspective\u2026 and above all, your atmosphere is more natural than anyone I know.\u201dWhile it\u2019s true that a certain degree of courtesy is important, if the other person forgives and opens their heart, that wall can easily be broken down.Kanata did not change his attitude towards Alphana, Maria, or even the Demon King Shuroza.\u201cEven towards me, a saint, and Maria, a princess, Kanata-sama treats us the same, and we find it very comfortable. Of course, the knowledge that you are Haishin-sama cannot be ignored, but meeting Kanata-sama rather than Haishin-sama is the happiest thing in my life.\u201d\u201c\u2026 You believe\u2026 that much?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dWith Alphana stopping, Kanata separated his head from her lap.However, as he was to call Alphana and turned his gaze towards her, she placed her hands on his cheeks.\u201cKanata-sama, whose thoughts I have never seen before, are you really from this world?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIf he was from this world, or so he was asked.Of course, Alphana didn\u2019t seem to have any proof asking this, and most importantly, she would not have come up with the idea that another world exists other than this one.Yet somehow, there was a strange conviction in Alphana\u2019s eyes.\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear the answer, but please let me say this,\u201d Alphana said slowly, biting her words.They are also the words that will sew Kanata into this world, and above all, they may be the words he has been seeking deep in his heart.\u201cKanata-sama, thank you for being in this world\u2026 for meeting us and really, thank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah.\u201dKanata originally wondered if there was any meaning to being born into this world.Even though he didn\u2019t know why he reincarnated into this world, he lived his life doing whatever he wanted because he had no choice if this was how it was going to be.But this was the first time he was ever told this.Seeing Kanata stunned, Alphana chuckled and softened the serious atmosphere.\u201cI never even thought that\u2026 There was a part of me that was a little jealous of Kanna-san. I could tell from the way Kanata-sama was acting that she probably did something.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dIt was more awkward than embarrassing to actually get told that.Kanata still stared at her, trying to avert his gaze but was not allowed to do so because Alphana had her.\u201cHuh, jealousy you mean\u2014\u201dThe moment he realized that something soft touched his lips.\u201c?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAlphana\u2019s lips were touching his.It was unmistakably a kiss, and when she pulled her face away, Alphana was so red that it worried him to the contrary.\u201cI love you, Kanata-sama. If it comes true, I want to give up my role as a saint and dedicate everything to you alone.\u201dAlphana\u2019s words, which conveyed a strong sense of determination and resolve, were deeply etched in Kanata\u2019s mind.Alphana just said she wanted him to live as he always has, but it was not possible for Kanata.\u201cMy heart\u2026 it\u2019s beating so fast.\u201dKanata, with his hand on his chest, returned to his room and muttered to himself.He was happy not only about Alphana\u2019s feelings but also about those words more than anything.\u201cThank you for coming to this world\u2026\u201dThose words made him truly, truly happy.[Postscript]So that\u2019s the end of volume two.TLN: Now tell! Do you guys want to read it to the end?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: Returning to Hometown\u201cAlright, everyone! Let\u2019s do another livestream today!!\u201dIt has become a tradition of the night, although sometimes he also livestream in the morning or afternoon, depending on the situation.Keen observers have started to speculate that Haishin\u2019s true identity may have a busy job in the morning and afternoon or perhaps a student.: Here we goooo!!: I\u2019ve been waiting for this all day!: Haishin-samaaaa!!: I love you!!: Haishin-sama is mine!!: Mine too!!Today, as well, the comments section was bustling with activity.It had been some time since he had travelled between the Principality and the Demon Kingdom, and many things had happened in the meantime.First, the infamous Haishin shirt was released.\u201cThere were quite a few people wearing Haishin shirts in the city, which was kind of complicated.\u201dThis statement might reveal that Kanata was in the capital, but with the cooperation of Athena, who lives in the Kingdom, the shirts got sold simultaneously in both countries.Although Kanata only witnessed the commotion in the capital, Athena\u2019s report indicated that the shirts sold out in less than 30 minutes.: I\u2019m from the Principality, and it was really crowded!: Yeah! Everyone was swarming to buy it!: I got scolded when I wore it to school, you know?: Well, that\u2019s obvious.: \u2026 I just wanted to be wrapped in Haishin-sama when I wore it to school.: Oh, um\u2026Kanata was grateful that people bought the shirts, but he couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the thought of someone wearing them in public.While a certain Goddess wore it all the time, Kanata thought she might not listen even if he warned her, as she might be a bit crazy.(\u2026 But the material used is of good quality, and it feels great to wear.)By the way, Kanata was wearing that shirt properly now.He didn\u2019t have the courage to wear it outside, so he only used it as room wear. Since it was similar to the clothes he had worn in his past life, he felt a wonderful sense of calm.\u201cI\u2019ll be reading your letters today, then.\u201dIt\u2019s time for Haishin\u2019s famous letter-reading segment.Most of the letters this time were about the shirt, with many grateful words expressing anticipation for future broadcasts.\u201cHuh?\u201dIn the midst of all that, a letter arrived that was a surprise, though there was no way to know if it was genuine or not.\u201cNice to meet you, Haishin-dono.I am a prime minister in the Empire, and our country intends to host you as a guest of honour.His Majesty is jealous that the Kingdom and the Principality have already beaten us to it.If it\u2019s alright with you, we would be honoured if you would consider visiting the Empire.Of course, Haishin-dono\u2019s will is the most important, so we would be grateful if you were to consider it.\u201dThe letter read.For Kanata, the Kingdom was his homeland, and he had only recently visited the Principality for the first time, so the only large country he had yet to go to was the Empire.\u201cThe Empire, huh\u2026? It\u2019s a country with a strong military industry, right? What kind of place is it?\u201d: It\u2019s kind of noble, isn\u2019t it?: But it\u2019s been fading quite a bit because of Haishin-sama\u2019s influence.: Haishin-sama\u2019s influencing things there too?: It\u2019s a thrilling place to want to go to.: There are also many good people there.: But lately\u2026As can be seen from the comments, there seem to be some suspicious movements within the Empire, but life there seemed to continue as usual.No matter how serious things get, the Emperor and his subordinates are all excellent people, so there was no need to worry.\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to visit the Empire if I have the opportunity.\u201dWhen he mentioned this, the movement in the comments section accelerated.Stalker-like comments asking when he would come, how he would come, and even those saying they would follow him increased.Naturally, there were also comments with familiar tones mixed in, and Kanata could only smile wryly.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s just a thought. A thought. I\u2019m busy too, and it\u2019s hard to leave my current location without a proper reason.\u201dThere\u2019s no way he could just travel back and forth between countries like it\u2019s nothing, and that\u2019s the conclusion Kanata has to come to in the current situation.After a little more small talk, Kanata ended the stream.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dAs expected, he felt a little tired after talking for a few hours.Kanata lay down on the bed and remembered something from back then.\u201c\u2026 The lap pillow felt good.\u201dThe lap pillow felt amazing under the pleasant atmosphere.He thought the same thing when Kanna gave him a lap pillow at the brothel before, and the sense of calmness he felt when he touched their kindness seemed like it could become a habit.[TLN:\u00a0cri*\u00a0It was a lap pillow.] [EDN: Lmao.]\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, Alphana\u2019s words came to mind when he thought about her.\u201cI love you.\u201dThose words burned into his mind.That was undoubtedly a confession, a confession of love to Kanata.\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t believe she said that to me.\u201dIn the end, Kanata couldn\u2019t find the right words to respond.He certainly thought Alphana, the beautiful girl he had met since coming to this world, was amazing and wished he could be in a relationship with her.\u201cI\u2019m not asking for an answer. I just wanted you to know how I feel.\u201dThat\u2019s what Alphana said before they parted ways that day.Since then, some time had passed, and Kanata had many opportunities to see Alphana at the academy and spend time with her and Maria after class.\u201cAlphana hasn\u2019t changed at all.\u201dShe was still the same as always, treating Kanata naturally as if that confession had never happened.\u201c\u2026 hmm.\u201dIt would be great if he could live as he pleased without worrying, but Kanata didn\u2019t know if it was the right thing.Even so, Kanata thought he absolutely needed to come up with an answer.\u201cWell\u2026 let\u2019s put that aside for now.\u201dSince there was nothing Kanata could do by worrying, he decided to put his thoughts about Alphana aside for the time being.The next thing Kanata thought about was the upcoming long holiday.Kanata\u2019s school has a holiday system, and a ten-day break is approaching next week.\u201cBasically, there\u2019s nothing planned, so everyone is free to do as they please. You can stay in the dorm or go back home. Well. Since it\u2019s a rare holiday, I\u2019d like to say that you should cherish the time with your family that you don\u2019t normally get to see.\u201dIt seemed that nobles would study estate management at home, but most nobles and commoners usually visit their hometowns.\u201cMaybe I should go home, too.\u201dEven if he says he\u2019s going back, he will probably only stay for about three days, but even so, it might be nice to at least see his parents for the first time in a long while.Thinking back, Kanata laughed that he hasn\u2019t been back to his hometown for quite some time now and that when he does, he will likely spend a lot of time talking.\u201cWell then, I guess I\u2019ll go to bed now.\u201dKanata said as he got into bed and went to sleep.However, just before he fell completely asleep, Aphana\u2019s smile came to mind and disappeared.Days passed, and the day finally came to return to his hometown.Kanata consulted with his teacher and was able to arrange for a carriage to take him part way along the road to his hometown. It was because his grades were reasonably good they were flexible with him.However, because of that, he was once again looked at with unpleasant gazes by some of the commoner students, including the noble students\u2026but he decided not to worry about it anymore.\u201cOh, it\u2019s been a long time since I came home\u2026 but\u2026\u201dKanata said, looking tired.\u201cFufu, I wonder what Kanata-kun\u2019s hometown is like.\u201d\u201cIs this the village of Roggin? \u2026 I\u2019ve never been there before!\u201dSitting across from Maria and Mira, Kanata couldn\u2019t help but feel excited.\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to it. Kanata-sama, please introduce us to your family \u266a\u201d\u201c\u2026 Sure\u201dAlphana was sitting next to Kanata with a big grin on her face.For some reason, the three accompanied Kanata on this trip home.Kanata wanted to ask if there were any problems with the Saint and Princess leaving the capital, but they were generally free-spirited, so Kanata decided not to ask.\u201cWell, with Mira here as well\u2026\u201d\u201cYes! I\u2019ll protect you!!\u201d\u2018\u2026 Well, I couldn\u2019t ask for better bodyguards,\u2019 Thinking so, Kanata chuckled.And since both Maria and Alphana are very good at magic, there seems to be no need to worry about anything after all.(Normally, they would have noticed something by now. Why hasn\u2019t anyone said anything?)Kanata couldn\u2019t help but feel like some mysterious power was at work\u2026 something like a supernatural power that could sew up and modify thoughts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: Returning Home with Three Beauties\u201cI think I may be interfering too much, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201cOh? I believe it is in a woman\u2019s nature to want to serve someone she likes. Is that not so?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t forget that you are not just a woman but also a goddess.\u201dThey were conversing at the heavenly throne that overlooked the people below, and the speakers were the Goddess Isla and another Goddess.\u201cLeanne, if you are wearing that, it\u2019s a sign that you like him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dThe woman called Leanne was also one of the Goddesses, just like Isla, and watched over another world.The Goddesses moved nimbly and casually between worlds, exchanging conversations with each other. They could even be called friends.\u201cWell\u2026 no excuses. I also like him,\u201d said Leanna, looking at the scene below. Kanata was having a pleasant conversation with Maria and the others.It was also worth mentioning that both Isla and Leanne were wearing Haishin shirts, which wrapped around their alluring bodies.One might wonder what was going on in the heavenly plane.\u201c\u2026 I really envy the peace you have on your side of the world.\u201d\u201cYour world seems to be going through some difficulties, doesn\u2019t it? Isn\u2019t the boy you reincarnated causing a lot of trouble and on the verge of being killed?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201dLeanne waved her hand, and a screen appeared.The image on the screen showed a handsome man covered in blood, being held at sword point by an expressionless boy.\u201cH-hey, can\u2019t we stop here? If it\u2019s your lover, I\u2019ll return her! I won\u2019t touch your lover anymore!!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about that anymore. It\u2019s none of my business what happens to her. But I can\u2019t forgive you for trying to harm my precious person\u2026 I will definitely kill you.\u201d\u201cKuh\u2026 damn youuuuuu!!!\u201dWith a swift motion, the handsome man\u2019s head got cut off by a sword.Watching the scene, Leanne sighed and drank some liquid from a drink she had unconsciously held in her hand.Although it was a video, someone had clearly died, but the Goddesses didn\u2019t seem to care much about it.\u201cAt first, I thought he was normal. But I guess humans change quickly when they become drunk with power.\u201d\u201cWell, I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t understand. We\u2019ve had similar situations in this world. But in our case, they weren\u2019t driven by hatred from the start, and having that child as a support was a big factor.\u201d\u2018That child\u2019 referred to Kanata, which was not hard to imagine.The footage of blood spraying like a fountain disappeared, and Leanne and Isla observed Kanata\u2019s situation again.For these Goddesses, it was easy to watch Kanata like this, but it also meant that Kanata had no privacy.\u201cSo, you\u2019re interfering excessively, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah. Well, no matter how much I say it, you won\u2019t stop, will you?\u201d\u201cOf course not. Besides, it\u2019s beneficial for that child too.\u201dThe conversation between the two was about Kanata.Isla\u2019s interference with Kanata was simply her altering her perception of him. An example of this was the current situation of Kanata, Maria, and Alphana.\u201cIf it gets widely exposed that Kanata is Haishin, it\u2019s obvious it would be difficult for him to move, so I\u2019m just manipulating everyone\u2019s perception of Kanata, except for a few people.\u201dNormally, the fact that the Princess and the Saint are close to a mere commoner like Kanata would lead to a lot of speculation.However, it remained at a minimum, and it\u2019s all thanks to this useless woman\u2026the work of the Goddess.\u201cAre you so fond of him that you interfere with people\u2019s perceptions of him?\u201d\u201cYes. Didn\u2019t I say it? When you\u2019re interested in a man, you want to do everything for him.\u201dIsla giggled.Her smile was not pure, but it also had a faint darkness to it.Even though she was a sacred Goddess, there was a hint of evil in Isla\u2019s mannerisms. She was quite powerful among the Goddesses, and Kanata, favoured by her, could be said to be truly fearless.(\u2026 Well, he\u2019s not particularly aware of Isla, but in a sense, his peace is guaranteed.)With that in mind, Leanne saw Kanata enjoying himself again.Although Leanne also likes him, she is not as deeply involved as Isla.However\u2026 The place much more peaceful than the world that Leanne was looking at was a little enviable.\u201cBut\u2026 Alphana, was it? That girl is so willful that she can resist my rule. How audacious.\u201dFinally, Isla muttered that while looking at Alphana instead of Kanata.~~~~~~~~~~\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201dKanata had no idea that such an exchange between Goddesses was taking place far up in the sky, but he tilted his head to the road leading to the village of Roggin.\u201cIs there anything wrong?\u201d\u201cDid something happen?\u201dMaria and Mira noticed Kanata\u2019s confusion.Only Alphana giggled to herself, and Kanata couldn\u2019t understand what was so funny. But he opened his mouth with interest as he looked outside.\u201cWell\u2026 this is the road leading to Roggin, but this area should have been a little rougher. And if we go any further, even a carriage would have had difficulty moving through.\u201dKanata opened the window and looked into the distance.It was a well-maintained road that continued, with railings placed several meters apart, possibly for the elderly.\u201c\u2026 Are we on the right road?\u201d\u201cWe are! If we keep going this way, we\u2019ll definitely reach Roggin.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIf Alphana said so, then there was no mistake.Moreover, even though the road was now neatly paved, the village of Roggin was definitely in sight.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really understand, but this is amazing. With this, carriages and the like should be able to enter the village smoothly.\u201dSurprised but grateful, he decided to ask his parents if they knew anything once they entered the village.Afterward, they rested to avoid overworking the horse on the hill, and finally, Kanata and the others arrived at the village of Roggin.\u201c\u2026 Is this real?\u201dBut, of course, Kanata was surprised.Although the buildings hadn\u2019t changed, a defensive wall was built to protect the village.Depending on the season, small magical beasts would sometimes enter the village, causing injuries or damaging crops.This wall was built to prevent that, and it was so impressive that one could understand its purpose at a glance.\u201c\u2026 Kanata?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah!\u201dSomeone called out to Kanata the moment he got off the carriage.It was someone who was closer to Kanata than anyone else\u2014his mother, Meza.\u201cMom!\u201d\u201cKanata!\u201dMeza ran towards Kanata with a loud voice.As she embraced Kanata, who she hadn\u2019t seen in a while, she hugged him tightly as if to confirm the feeling of her son.\u201c\u2026 Geez, Mom, you seem to be doing well.\u201d\u201cAnd you too. But anyway\u2026hmm?\u201dMeza stopped moving and looked at the women who were standing behind him.Other villagers also turned their attention to Kanata and Meza, as her voice was loud.(\u2026 We need to start explaining a lot of things.)Kanata was worried about how to explain everything, but Meza spoke up.\u201cSeriously, three girlfriends!?\u201d\u201cWhy are you saying that?\u201dUpon hearing that, Kanata remembered his own mother.She was generally unaware of the situation and wasn\u2019t very familiar with Maria or Alphana\u2019s faces.If she knew them, she would realize it would be unusual for them to be in such a place.\u201cWell, first of all\u2026 shall we introduce ourselves?\u201dBefore Kanata could finish his sentence, Maria and Alphana had already stepped forward.\u201cNice to meet you, Kanata-kun\u2019s mother.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Kanata-sama\u2019s mother.\u201dSlowly they bowed their heads.They bowed slowly and elegantly.Their refined movements were so beautiful that Meza was taken aback. Even Mira, who was left behind, bowed as if learning from them.But then she suddenly dropped a bombshell.\u201cNice to meet you! Until recently, I was an assassin!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata was troubled about how to introduce the three of them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: Parents are kind-hearted\u201c\u2026 We don\u2019t have much, but please enjoy this.\u201d\u201cOh no, we are grateful for your thoughtfulness.\u201d\u201cWow, this looks delicious!!\u201dKanata\u2019s parents\u2019 home, located in a corner of Roggin, was very lively.It was understandable, as Kanata\u2019s parents and the girls, who accompanied, Kanata were all gathered there.\u201cBut still, you haven\u2019t done anything outrageous, have you?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t!\u201d\u201c\u2026 If the Princess and the Saint were offended by something my foolish son did, what kind of apology should I offer?\u201dKanata\u2019s parents clearly cherished him, but it was also clear that having two important people from the Kingdom visit was unusual, and they were very careful about it.Kanata then explained his relationship with Maria and the others in detail, including the circumstances leading up to it.\u201cThey are all really important friends to me. Actually, I was surprised to be able to be together like this\u2026 Anyway, there\u2019s no hidden agenda or anything like that.\u201dAs Kanata desperately explained, Maria and Mira also attempted to calm his parents down with their words.Watching everyone\u2019s lively, yet desperate behaviour, Alphana chuckled.(I\u2019ve never been here before, but it\u2019s a nice place.)For Alphana, Roggin was a special place just because it was where Kanata was born and raised.Although it was clear it was not as bustling as the capital and not a place where outsiders would visit on purpose, Alphana felt a special warmth there because it was Kanata\u2019s hometown.\u201cI mean, you said earlier that you were an assassin, right, Mira-san?\u201d\u201cYes! Actually, my name is Raven\u2014\u201d\u201cThe word \u2018assassin\u2019 is just a figure of speech. She\u2019s actually just a normal friend of ours, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cW-why are you stopping me!?\u201d\u201cShut up, shorty.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say!?\u201dMaria immediately tried her best to diffuse the situation.The tension between Maria and Mira, who stared each other down, seemed to loosen a little, and Kanata\u2019s parents began to soften as well.Kanata\u2019s mother\u2019s name was Meza, and his father was Asta, and they had already introduced themselves.\u201cWe apologize for the suddenness of all this. We just wanted to see the village where Kanata-sama was born and raised now that he\u2019s returned home.\u201dAlphana\u2019s words held a lot of meaning.She also couldn\u2019t deny that she had a girlish desire to spend the long holiday with Kanata, but since it was basically guaranteed they would be together like this, Alphana, Maria, and even Mira were feeling on top of the world.\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you to say\u2026 and thank you very much for that\u2026 Saint-sama.\u201d\u201cNo. If anything, I should have acted a little faster.\u201d\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s okay!\u201d\u201c?\u201dMeza was probably thanking them for the road that had been built to the village, as well as the installation of a protective wall.Maria knew about this, but Kanata and Mira, who didn\u2019t know the truth, tilted their heads in confusion.\u201cActually, it\u2019s\u2026\u201dAlphana explained to the two of them what had happened.Kanata immediately understood the changes that had taken place on the road and bowed his head in gratitude to Alphana.\u201cThank you so much, Alphana. I see\u2026 you acted upon that little mutter you overheard.\u201d\u201cYes. However, even if we didn\u2019t hear from Kanata-sama, we would have still done it if we knew about it. Of course, Maria would have done the same, wouldn\u2019t she?\u201d\u201cOf course! Even though Alphana acted first this time\u2026 I plan on using my princess authority to work hard too!!\u201d\u201cU-Um\u2026\u201dKanata trembled as Maria leaned in closer to him.\u201c\u2026 Dear, what did you really do?\u201d\u201cKanata\u2026 You\u2019ve really grown into an impressive man without us noticing, haven\u2019t you?\u201dMeza was stunned, while Asta felt moved in a slightly strange way by Kanata\u2019s newfound popularity.After the tension loosened, they were able to have a normal conversation.Maria enthusiastically talked about life at the academy, while Mira talked about their personal lives, causing a chaotic atmosphere. Kanata put his hand on his forehead, asking them to stop.\u201c\u2026 Fufu.\u201dAlthough Alphana wasn\u2019t excluded from the conversation, she found it more enjoyable and happy to just watch and listen.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, Alphana was also thinking about something else.Rather than thinking, it was more like recalling. Maybe it would be better to say that something inevitable resurfaced in her mind.(Kanata-sama\u2026 The words I told you at that time were not a lie.)It was about the words she told him during the confession.Even if Kanata wasn\u2019t someone born with memories from a different world, Alphana\u2019s love for him would not change.Moreover, there was a proper reason why Alphana knew about that confidential information.(\u2026 I don\u2019t know why I caught a glimpse of the Goddess\u2019 memories.)Occasionally, there were moments when she lost her senses.At those times, Alphana often surrendered herself to something, but during one such moment, she desperately resisted that sensation.It is unclear whether Alphana\u2019s strong will had overcome it, but at that moment, memories of a goddess-like entity trying to enter Alphana\u2019s consciousness flowed in.(I recognized Kanata-sama, not everything about him, but enough to feel joy in the ability to meet him in this world and to be grateful for this miracle. At the same time, I want this world to become an important place for Kanata-sama.)It was Alphana\u2019s wish and her utmost love for Kanata.Initially, she would use being alone while listening to Kanata\u2019s live stream as an excuse to shout and scream, but now, though she might still have such peculiar behaviour, her feelings towards Kanata were undoubtedly genuine.However, Alphana was a woman before she was a Saint.\u201c\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s kind of a sleepover?\u201dAlphana\u2019s cheeks were loose with a grin, as she indulged in a peachy-pink fantasy unlike a Saint\u2019s. Things such as showering together, gazing at the stars together, talking about love, or sleeping in the same bed.\u201cSaint-sama?\u201d\u201cYes, what is it?\u201dAlphana, called out by Meza, quickly tightened her expression.Her swift action showed that she was indeed a Saint and that she had a strong enough will to hide anything unseemly from his parents.\u201c\u2026 However, we don\u2019t have a good enough home to accommodate noble people like you.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s true. We have a place to sleep, but it\u2019s not suitable for accommodating high-ranking people like you.\u201dMeza and Asta were troubled about where Alphana and her companions could sleep, but they didn\u2019t know anything about them.As they talked, it became clear that these girls were head over heels for Kanata and, above all else, they were not the type of women to worry about such small things.\u201cI don\u2019t mind at all. I\u2019ll sleep in the same room as Kanata-kun.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll sleep with Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s totally fine! I\u2019ll stick to the ceiling and sleep while staring at Kanata-sama\u2019s sleeping face!\u201dAmused by how well they were getting along, Kanata lightly chopped Mira and gave her a retort.~~~~~~~~\u201c\u2026 haah, I\u2019m exhausted.\u201dKanata let out a small sigh.While he was happy that the three of them had come to his hometown, it was just too rural, and he could understand the troubles his parents were experiencing.\u201cYou really are something, Dear\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve grown up, Kanata.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you, that\u2019s way too off!\u201dAnd Meza slapped Asta on the back.(\u2026 Honestly, if I was told this is what princesses looked like, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it.)Kanata\u2019s gaze turned to where Maria and Alphana were happily helping with the farming.Not only was it something they would never normally do, but as princesses, they would never do this kind of thing for eternity.\u201cWhew, it\u2019s quite tiring. Oh, look at this, Maria.\u201d\u201cWhat is it\u2026 gyaaaaaaaahhhh!?\u201dAlphana was holding a mini-worm, a creature that in Kanata\u2019s previous life was called an earthworm.It seems that Alphana has some resistance to creatures like this, but Maria seems to dislike them enough to scream in terror.\u201cYippee-hoo!\u201dMira returned after defeating a huge boar-like monster.She set it down on the ground with a loud thud, and the villagers cheered her on.\u201cBy the way, Kanata.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t to ruin the fun, but Meza\u2019s words made Kanata stop thinking.\u201cDo you know about Haishin?\u201d\u201c!?\u201dIt would have been a nightmare for anyone else, but a question from family was especially nerve-wracking for Kanata.However, in this case, Meza\u2019s words were a relief for Kanata.\u201cSome great person used to come to this village and taught us about him. Your father and I didn\u2019t really get into it, but he sounded like you for some reason, and it seemed silly to make a fuss about it.\u201cOh, I see\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way that\u2019s you, but I don\u2019t hate the cheerful atmosphere that reminds me of you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Mom!!\u201dIt\u2019s not hard to imagine that Kanata would have had a mental breakdown if they had become addicted to Haishin.Perhaps his parents had sensed something about Haishin, but it seemed to have worked out in a positive way.However, Kanata, this is just his parents\u2019 reaction.What about the other villagers? He\u2019ll find out soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: Changes in the Village\u201cIs Haishin-sama going to do a stream today?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 but I want to listen!\u201d\u201cOh, Haishin-sama! Please bless us with your voice today too\u2014\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata dragged his mouth down in exasperation.He had been away from the group of women and was walking around the small village for the first time in a while when he stumbled upon a bunch of youths going crazy over Haishin.He hadn\u2019t noticed it when he first entered the village, but now that he saw it with his own eyes, he felt more than just happy about Haishin\u2019s newfound fame; he also felt a sense of complexity.\u201cOh, hey Kanata!\u201dHis childhood friends recognized him instantly. They had spent their youth together in this small town, roaming the fields and hills.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while\u2026\u201dHe smiled as they surrounded him with questions about Maria and Alphana.But inevitably, the conversation turned to Haishin.\u201cWhat do you think of Haishin-sama, Kanata?\u201d\u201cOf course, he\u2019s amazing! I\u2019m a huge fan!\u201d\u201cLook at this. I even went out and bought his shirt!\u201dThey were talking about Haishin as if he wasn\u2019t there but entirely somewhere else, discussing their admiration for him without any hint of suspicion or doubt.While Kanata had no lack of desire to be famous and bask in the attention, seeing how much his old friends had changed made him feel a little uneasy.(\u2026 Calm down, Kanata! Just think of them as fans and the \u2018cost of fame\u2019 as trivial!)He let out a small breath and managed to calm down slightly.Although he had prepared high-quality equipment with Maria and the others to help him stream from anywhere in the carriage, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little scared at the thought of hearing a joyous roar throughout the village as soon as he began streaming.\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll be going now.\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk again soon!\u201dThey left, chattering excitedly.Kanata watched them go, then headed towards the village chief\u2019s house.\u201cOh, Kanata, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cLong time no see, Village Chief.\u201dHe was an elder with a stooped back but seemed surprisingly energetic and not yet ready to get called to heaven.\u201cOh Kanata, I am a fortunate man, you know?\u201d\u201cWhat for?\u201d\u201cWell, for being able to meet the Saint concerned about the village.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dKanata knew about it too, and he thanked Alphana for it.Although it should have been easy to just listen to the story, Kanata felt deep gratitude and obligation for actually taking action.Alphana was truly worthy of being called a Saint for her compassion, and Kanata wondered if she acted so quickly because of him.(\u2026 I mean, how much of a good person is Alphana?)Of course, Kanata was grateful not only to Alphana but also to Maria and Mira, but Alphana\u2019s kindness had really touched him.She couldn\u2019t have known everything about Kanata\u2019s circumstances, but the fact that she accepted Kanata by using examples from another world was truly a lot.\u201cPhew, I\u2019m just too blessed.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dAs Kanata turned around in response to the voice from behind, something covered his eyes. He could tell that it was probably a hand covering his eyes, but he also felt the sensation of someone pressing their body against his while doing so.\u201cIt\u2019s Alphana, right?\u201d\u201cOh, you knew it was me?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dIt was such an easy problem to solve just from her voice alone.When she removed her hand and turned around, Alphana was indeed there.\u201cYou seemed lost in thought\u2026 Are you okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m totally fine. What about Maria and Mira?\u201dApparently, Alphana was the only one who had slipped away, and Maria and Mira seemed to be enjoying their work.\u201cMaria seems to really enjoy working in the fields, and Mira went out to hunt monsters again.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re really having a blast, huh?\u201d\u201cI think they\u2019re both enjoying it so much because it\u2019s something they wouldn\u2019t normally experience.\u201dKanata had wondered what would happen since there was no entertainment or facilities like in the capital, but if they were really enjoying themselves, then it was fortunate.Alphana seemed to enjoy working in the fields and promised Maria they would plant crops together.\u201cAs a saint, I have never done such a thing before\u2026 but if I had not been recognized as a saint and had lived as a commoner, this could have been another way of life.\u201dIt was the same for Kanata.If he did not possess magic, he might not have even gone to the academy, and there would have been no culture of live streaming since he would not have engaged in activities like Haishin.Moreover, he might not have met these girls.\u201cThere may have been a future where I quietly spent my days in this village without meeting Alphana and the others\u2026 or something like that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026 but.\u201dAlphana held Kanata\u2019s hand.She wrapped both hands around it and continued to speak while looking straight into Kanata\u2019s eyes.\u201cI can say this because I have already met Kanata-sama, but there might have been such a future. In a world without Haishin-sama, perhaps there would have been no future where you and I would meet\u2026 but now, I can confidently say that I absolutely do not accept such a future.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Alphana?\u201d\u201cI am already drawn to Kanata-sama. Now that I know this feeling, now that I know Kanata-sama\u2026 I don\u2019t want to think about a world where we don\u2019t meet, even as a possibility.\u201dShe sounded desperate.Kanata was startled by her words, but he agreed with Alphana.\u201cNow that I know the joy of being Haishin and the joy of being Kanata, I can\u2019t imagine anything else. A world without Alphana and Maria\u2026 I don\u2019t want to imagine it either.\u201d\u201cExactly. Ufufu \u266a\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201dAlphana\u2019s smile was somewhat suggestive, and Kanata\u2019s heart skipped a beat, but he tried to maintain his composure as he asked.Alphana released his hand and leaned in, resting her body against his chest.\u201cHuh\u2026 Alphana?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re nervous\u2026 aren\u2019t you, Kanata-sama?\u201dAlphana pressed her ear to his chest as if listening to Kanata\u2019s heartbeat and then looked up at him and said,\u201cI\u2019m feeling nervous too\u2026 Please put your hand on my chest.\u201d\u201cUh, umm\u2026\u201dKanata hesitated for a moment before Alphana took his hand and placed it on her chest.He could feel her heartbeat throbbing against his palm, passing through the soft, plump sensation.(What is this fluffy feeling? It\u2019s dangerous\u2026)Kanata felt an overwhelming heat spread throughout his body, from his head to his toes.He started feeling nauseous, but then he heard a voice that snapped him out of it.\u201cKanata-kun~? Alphana~?\u201d\u201cOh my\u2026\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dAlphana and Kanata quickly separated.Maria had called out to them, and it seemed she had been looking for them.\u201cOh, there you are.\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem like Maria had caught them in a compromising position, so she approached them like always.\u201cKanata-kun, your face is really red?\u201d\u201cOh, is it maybe a fever?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not good! You need to rest!\u201d\u201cNo, no! I\u2019m fine, really!\u201dIn the end, Alphana returned to her usual self, Maria joined them, and the three spent time together.\u201cI love farming. It\u2019s amazing seeing the crops we worked hard on grow and ripen with our sweat and effort.\u201d\u201cOh, so that means we\u2019ll have to come back here during harvest time, Kanata-sama?\u201d\u201cKanata-kun!\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019d love to visit again.\u201dThey both smiled brightly as they said this.Thus, it was decided they would visit again someday, possibly with Mira.(\u2026 Things might get worse by then.)Kanata knew the Haishin craze would grow bigger, but he didn\u2019t mind anymore.He decided to keep streaming without fear, starting today.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: Alraune\u201c\u2026 Geez, the view is bad just because we\u2019re on a mountain\u2026 Hey, you two. You should both go back to the village as expected. I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t listen to you, Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Kanata-kun.\u201dAfter sunset, Kanata and the others faced each other in the growing darkness. The place they were at was further up the mountain from Roggin, where trees were dense and the darkness pitch black. Even though Maria and Alphana were using light magic to shine the way, Kanata thought it wasn\u2019t a good idea to have them accompany him any further.\u201cIf something happens to you two, it\u2019ll be really bad.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll lose my head.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t happen.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t happen.\u201dKanata sighed, feeling that it was pointless to say anything more.Why were they walking in the mountains at such a dark hour in the first place?It was because Mira, who had gone hunting, had yet to return. He didn\u2019t think anything was wrong since it was Mira, but it was natural to think something was amiss if she hadn\u2019t even contacted them.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s wrong to have the princess and saint accompany me on something like this, but I\u2019m counting on you both to help me find Mira.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe two of them nodded happily in response to Kanata\u2019s words. Nevertheless, if anything happened, they would immediately turn back. At this point, Kanata had no choice but to protect them with all his might while searching for Mira.(Well, it\u2019s a good thing I have experience running around this area from the past.)Despite the bad visibility, Kanata had a general idea of the terrain, so he didn\u2019t think he would get lost even among the dense trees. Moreover, Kanata was emitting an almost absurd amount of infinite magical power as a threat, deterred magical beasts, and a strong magical barrier to protect Kanata and the others.\u201cWow, this is amazing. It feels like we\u2019re being protected by Kanata-kun\u2019s magic.\u201d\u201cKanata-sama\u2019s magic is very warm and pleasant\u2026 so gentle.\u201d\u201cThanks for that. Now let\u2019s go find Mira quickly.\u201dIf Mira had returned to the village, she would have sensed the magic emitted and come to them. Kanata was sure she wouldn\u2019t disappear from his presence without a word.Although he had been troubled by Mira\u2019s stalking behaviour, he could not imagine her being gone because she was that obsessed with Kanata.\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s an ominous magic.\u201dAs the three continued forward without ever separating, inhuman waves of ominous magic drifted toward them.Maria unsheathed the sword at her waist, and Alphana enveloped herself in holy magic.\u201cIs it a demon?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible, but\u2026 it\u2019s weaker than Shrouza-san\u2019s magic.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s probably true.\u201dOnly Kanata knew that Shrouza was the Demon King, and if he heard that there was a demon with stronger magic than Shrouza, he would wonder what kind of demon could surpass the Demon King.\u201cI don\u2019t rule over all demons. There aren\u2019t many demons who have left the demon world, but they still exist.\u201dThose were the words Kanata had heard from Shrouza.There was a story of an unnamed demon who had come here and saved the villagers, including Kanata\u2019s parents, but whether that demon was already here at the time was unclear.Although there were still many mysteries, Kanata and the others slowly moved forward.\u201cKanata-sama?\u201d\u201cAh! Mira!?\u201dKanata heard Mira\u2019s voice, which was hoarse, and he became anxious. But at that moment, something squirmed on the ground.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026!\u201d\u201cKanata-sama!!\u201dAt Alphana\u2019s scream, Kanata instinctively unleashed the magic he had been holding back.He didn\u2019t have much control over his magic, but when it came to this kind of trick, only possible with infinite magic, he was the best.\u201cStay close, both of you.\u201dAs Kanata spoke, he shielded them and violently scattered his magical power. As a result, the flowers and grass that had previously grown among the trees flew away, and something unpleasant and wriggling appeared.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cIs this ivy?\u201dIt was countless ivies, wriggling as if there were hundreds of snakes. Maria, who had no resistance to this sort of thing, showed her displeasure.It is an eerie sight even for Kanata, but he is more concerned with finding Mira.Thus, with Kanata\u2019s magical power finally raging, Mira\u2019s figure appeared before the three of them.\u201cMira!\u201dMira got entangled in the ivy, which looked like tentacles, pulsating as if sucking something out of her body.\u201cLooks like her magical power is being drained!\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s faster to cut it down!\u201dMaria slashed the ivy with her sword, freeing Mira.(\u2026 That was like a scene from an erotic manga\u2026 Stop it, me!)Kanata shook his head to dispel such indecent thoughts from his mind. With Mira no longer having her magical power drained, her complexion gradually improved, and she opened her eyes firmly.\u201cEveryone\u2026You guys are\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026! But\u2026 where is she?\u201d\u201cShe?\u201dWhen we three asked who \u2018she\u2019 was, a disgustingly sweet voice rang out.\u201cPhew, she got away. What a pain.\u201dKanata immediately turned his attention to the source of the voice. A woman walked towards them\u2026 but Kanata quickly averted his eyes.\u201cHey, why the h**l are you dressed like that\u2026?\u201dThe woman was not wearing any clothes. However, she was not entirely exposed, with leaves stuck to cover her chest and sensitive areas.\u201cA pervert\u2026\u201d\u201cDefinitely a pervert\u2026\u201d\u201cShe looks like a pervert, but be careful. She\u2019s quite tricky.\u201dThe atmosphere from a moment ago was a complete lie, but it was still clear that she was a skilled opponent to have captured Mira.\u201cBeing a pervert is terrible, but what can we do? We are Alraune, after all,\u201d commented the woman, who seemed to belong to the Alraune species.She had long green hair that reached the ground, green eyes, and even green skin. Everything that made up this woman was green.\u201cOh my, what a fine man. Your magical power is so\u2026 hmm?\u201dThe woman looked at Kanata\u2019s face as if she had noticed something.She stared for a moment before suddenly covering her huge b*****s and crotch with her hands and blushing.\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like hiding it now makes any sense.\u201d\u201cI know, right\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dKanata had already averted his gaze, but even Mira tilted her head in confusion at the sudden change in front of her.Ignoring why an Alraune was on this mountain, Kanata was eager to return to the village now that Mira had returned.\u201cCould you be\u2026 Haishin-sama?\u201dKanata realized that the atmosphere had completely changed as the woman\u2019s face became that of a love-struck maiden. He had heard through Shrouza that Haishin\u2019s existence was well-known among the demon race, but he never thought that this woman they coincidentally met was also a fan.For the demon race who could see magical power, it was impossible to hide his true identity.\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Mint of the Alraune.\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201d\u201cI always listen to your streams. Your voice is amazing\u2026 I always drip with nectar while listening to your streams.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata was puzzled by what kind of nectar she was referring to.As Mint slowly approached him, one step at a time, Kanata couldn\u2019t help but find her bewitching body a little too much for him. But Maria was there to help.\u201cFor now, wear this.\u201d\u201cHuh? \u2026 Oh! That\u2019s Haishin-sama\u2019s shirt!!\u201dEveryone must have wondered why she had it. But if it helped her cover her body, Kanata didn\u2019t mind waiting for Mint to put on the shirt.\u201cI\u2019m a demon, so I couldn\u2019t go into town to buy this myself.\u201d\u201cSo you tried to buy it\u2026\u201dKanata was already tired of everything.\u201cI see\u2026 I didn\u2019t take the demons into consideration. I\u2019ll have to work on that with Shrouza-san.\u201dMeanwhile, Alphana fully focused on business.While Kanata was relieved that nothing major happened, he didn\u2019t want too much trouble since his hometown was nearby.\u201cHey, by the way, what were you doing with Mira?\u201d\u201cI was just going to absorb a little bit of her magic. It\u2019s the best treat for our kind. Well, it was a little bland, though.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not good at magic anyway.\u201dMira didn\u2019t seem to mind getting caught, either. Afterward, she told them she was only visiting temporarily and would soon move in the direction of the great forest.\u201cI took care of the nearby magical beasts just in case. They may not have known about Haishin-sama\u2019s hometown, but they\u2019re a threat to weak humans, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dKanata nodded since he didn\u2019t encounter any magical beasts until now.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Haishin-sama. I didn\u2019t know, yet ended up involving myself with your acquaintances.\u201dAlthough her voice was as ponderous as ever, they could tell she was sorry for what she had done.Mira nodded in agreement to indicate she was okay, and in a way, Mint\u2019s action contributed to protecting the village, so Kanata couldn\u2019t really scold her too harshly.In the end, they decided to forgive Mint and head down the mountain, but it seemed that Mint was quite hungry, so Kanata let her absorb his magic power, even if she sucked him dry.Then, an incredibly difficult scene unfolded before them.\u201cOh\u2026 it\u2019s going inside!! It\u2019s going in a looot. It\u2019s so wonderful!!\u201dThe infinite and boundless magic power poured into Mint, surpassing even the highest quality.\u201cDon\u2019t look, Kanata-sama!\u201d\u201cI knew she was a pervert!\u201d\u201cHer belly is swelling up tremendously!\u201dNeedless to say, it was a previous experience that reminded Kanata of erotic manga that had almost faded away from his mind.\u201cThank you, Mint. You helped me recall an important memory from the past\u2026\u201dKanata conveyed his gratitude and turned his back on Mint, who trembled violently.[EDN: Why.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: Events everywhereAt the same time Kanata and others had an encounter with Mint, Cid was troubled with directions in the Principality.The microphone\u2019s completion requested by Kanata was progressing well and was already near completion.\u201c\u2026 This is it.\u201dIn front of Cid was not a normal microphone but something that resembled a human head.\u201cKanata requested a microphone for recording sound\u2026 but somehow, when hearing about ASMR, this three-dimensional shape seems to provide further depth.\u201dThe microphone requested by Kanata to Cid did not have this shape in the first place, but it was an idea that Cid came up with, thinking that this shape might be good.Coincidentally, Cid\u2019s idea perfectly reproduced the dummy head binaural microphone from Kanata\u2019s past life.\u201cBut\u2026 the material\u2026\u201dThe shape was perfect, and by adjusting it, it would be possible to express even more sensual voices\u2026 but there was one last problem.Perhaps because it had a different mechanism from before, it did not work well when used with magic.Why was that? After thinking about it, he concluded he needed a special and expensive ore unavailable on the market.\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t buy mithril ore with my earnings, and even if I had the money, it\u2019s not sold in the Principality.\u201dMithril is a top-quality metal among metals.Its quality and strength are unparalleled, and it is mostly used in equipment for the highest-ranking adventurers and national dignitaries. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain and expensive.Substitution with other metals is possible, but Cid did not want to compromise.\u201cI was asked to make the best microphone. Can I call myself a craftsman if I don\u2019t make the best product?\u201dThat was Cid\u2019s way of craftsmanship.Since Kanata told him to contact him if there was anything, he took the terminal and considered consulting him.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dIt was Athena who entered with a bang.Dressed in luxurious clothing unsuitable for Cid\u2019s workshop, Athena exclaimed in surprise at the microphone that had taken shape.\u201cIs this the one?\u201d\u201cYes. The form is just my idea, but I think it\u2019s a sculpture that Kanata can put his emotions into.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hmm.\u201dAthena seemed intrigued by the microphone, which unexpectedly resembled a human head. From her reaction, it seemed like it would be well-received. Since Cid had become Kanata\u2019s full-fledged collaborator, he had also become closer to Athena, and it was no longer unusual for her to visit his workshop.\u201cSo, what\u2019s the problem? It seemed like you had a dissatisfied or incomplete expression, even though you were able to make it?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dCid explained the situation honestly. Although the microphone can perform its minimum role in its current state, for Cid\u2019s vision and Kanata\u2019s maximum performance, mithril was necessary.\u201cI see. Fufu, what were you worried about? You could have consulted me about that, no?\u201d\u201cBut, mithril is quite expensive\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a daughter of a duke, you know.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yeah.\u201dBeing a Duke\u2019s family meant they were wealthy. With funding taken care of and a lead on mithril, Cid breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cSo, until when are you going to speak so formally?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for \u2018buts.\u2019 We used to play together, didn\u2019t we?\u201dAlthough they were childhood friends who used to play together, their relationship had severed due to differences in status as commoners and aristocrats. It was a past they had both forgotten about until they reunited through their mutual acquaintance, Kanata.\u201cSo, have any fools been causing trouble since then?\u201d\u201cNo, not really. They wouldn\u2019t want to make enemies with the Duke\u2019s family.\u201dCid\u2019s cooperation with Kanata meant Athena would provide him with full support. Therefore, bothering Cid is the same as making Athena an enemy.Many people are unhappy with Cid\u2019s rise, whom they previously looked down upon, but with Athena\u2019s generous support, Cid\u2019s life has completely changed.\u201cI\u2019ll have the mithril delivered right away.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that too fast?\u201d\u201cBecause we\u2019re duchy.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCid realized the power of those in authority once again. Money and power are truly amazing.****It was that same night when Kanata and his group returned to the village with Mira.Meza and Asta put a lot of effort into preparing the food.The dish was prepared with seafood bought from a merchant who comes to the village three times a month and meat from animals Mira had hunted.\u201cThis is delicious.\u201d\u201cSo, Kanata-kun, you grew up eating this.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so good!\u201dThere was no truth to the notion that food made by commoners didn\u2019t suit the taste of nobles, and all three women were genuinely enjoying the food.For Kanata, it had been a long time since he had tasted the flavours of his hometown, but he was satisfied with the deliciousness that was just as good as any meal he had tasted in the capital city.(\u2026 Yummmm, this is what it tastes like\u2026 right?)Although he wasn\u2019t moved to tears, it was a nostalgic feeling that was somewhat emotional.After dinner, it was time to take a bath.However, since it was a small, rural bath, only one person could bathe at a time.\u201cWell, even though it\u2019s a countryside place, at least we have a bath, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cIf it were a little bigger, I could have bathed with Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201cAgreed, if it were possible.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too bad!\u201dKanata gave the three of them a stern look that said, \u201cDon\u2019t say things like that.\u201dAs each of them had to take turns washing, they found themselves with some free time, except for Maria, who went first.While killing time with small talk, Kanata suddenly muttered something like this,\u201cBut when I was little, it was terrible. There was even a worst-case scenario where small worms came out when we turned on the hot water.\u201d\u201cThat sounds terrible.\u201d\u201cEww\u2026\u201dIt was a memory that had faded away unless intentionally remembered. The trauma of small worms coming out mixed in with the hot water the moment he opened the old, broken shower drain was still vivid. Even though it wouldn\u2019t happen now, if the same thing happened to Maria, it would definitely cause a disturbing scream.\u201cThat sounds like fun, though.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Alphana, you\u2019re not holding back against Maria, huh?\u201d\u201cYes, well, we\u2019ve known each other for a long time. Among people of the same age, she\u2019s my best female friend, you could say.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cOh, but for the opposite s*x, it\u2019s Kanata-sama \u266a.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dKanata\u2019s heart was pierced by her sudden attack with a smile.As these kinds of exchanges increased, Mira, who was only infatuated with Kanata, tilted her head in confusion. It wasn\u2019t love she had for him yet, but a woman\u2019s intuition is still sensitive to such things.\u201cKanata-sama! Me too! You\u2019re the only guy that I am closest to!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ou.\u201dKanata looked embarrassed, so Mira smiled broadly, knowing that her choice of words was not wrong.As they stared at him, Kanata thought back to today, and he was certain it had been a fulfilling trip back home, despite the difficulties.(\u2026 Damn, so many things really happened this year.)Where did it all begin? It was as if the chain of events that brought them together started with Alphana.It was definitely the girls who brought him the noisy but joyful days, despite all the hard work.Just as Kanata was about to smile, Maria screamed.\u201cKyaaaahhhh!\u201dKanata rushed over to Maria, and a fairly large worm appeared from somewhere.Maria was apparently washing her hair and let her guard down for a moment when she saw it, causing her to scream.\u201cKanata-kun!\u201dMaria hugged Kanata, not angry at him but rather grateful that he came to help.\u201cMa\u2026 Maria\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah.\u201dMaria quickly let go of Kanata, but he had seen everything.It was a lucky pervert situation that could result in a death sentence depending on the time and place, considering that Maria was of royal blood. Blushing deeply, she muttered, \u2018Ecchi.\u2019\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201dOf course, Maria understood that Kanata was just worried about her and quickly forgave him with a smile.\u201cHe saw everything\u2026\u201dKanata was so tired that he felt like giving up on today\u2019s stream.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: A Story of Another World\u201c\u2026\u00a0sigh. Today has been quite eventful,\u201d Kanata thought about all the things that had happened.He was currently sitting in a carriage in front of the equipment he had brought to do his live stream. He couldn\u2019t do it in his own home, nor he wanted to go somewhere he might run into villagers, so he ended up in the carriage.\u201cShall I give you a massage, Kanata-sama?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Thank you, Alphana.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to comment on how sensual her offer sounded.Alphana\u2019s \u2018massage\u2019 was actually a shoulder massage, a kind gesture for Kanata, who was tired from everything that had happened.The live stream would start in a few minutes, but he was extra cautious since it was an outdoor broadcast.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of things outside. I\u2019m on high alert.\u201dNot many people can get past Mira\u2019s detection, so as long as she is alert, they should be safe.Of course, Mira will also be listening to the stream with earphones on to make sure no one hears her.\u201cCan you really concentrate with those on, Mira-san?\u201d\u201cYes, I can. When I listen to Kanata-sama\u2019s stream, I go into a trance state and can concentrate more than usual!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is that okay?\u201dKanata suddenly felt anxious.\u201cBut Alphana and I are really in the best seats. We get to be here with Kanata-kun while he streams.\u201dMaria and Alphana were even closer to him than Mira.Since they were there anyway, Kanata suggested they listen in, and they agreed not to speak and keep the sound off.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll use magic to block out our voices.\u201dBlocking out the sound was just another application of the magic used to conceal their presence. Magic was all-powerful in this different world.Streaming while being watched by someone else wasn\u2019t something he had done since he was in the Principality, but it wasn\u2019t too nerve-wracking. Plus, it was also a way to thank the two for everything they had done for him regarding Haishin.\u201cWell, I was thinking of having a casual chat today, but\u2026 I thought of doing something new.\u201d\u201cSomething new?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dKanata grinned at the excited looks of the two.It wasn\u2019t anything particularly special, but he had come up with something that only he could do in the absence of entertainment.\u201cI told Mira a story I knew before. There are storybooks in this world, but it seems there\u2019s nothing like what I told Mira. I want to share it with you like a storytelling session.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cLike a read-aloud?\u201dIt would be a story mixed with Kanata\u2019s memories, embellished in a funny way, but it was an experiment that might resonate with other people, given Mira\u2019s good reception.\u201cThen let\u2019s get started. Mira, I\u2019m counting on you too!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d The three of them replied cutely.*****Shortly thereafter, Kanata\u2019s livestream began.Maria, watching it nearby, trembled with joy, and her breath became slightly rough.However, even that sound was blocked by magic, so he couldn\u2019t hear her. Alphana beside her seemed to be telling her to calm down as she pinched her cheeks.(Calm down. You\u2019re making a face that a lady shouldn\u2019t make.)(But it\u2019s so exciting! You\u2019re excited too, right, Alphana?)(A good woman shouldn\u2019t show such emotions on her face. It\u2019s better to desperately fantasize about it in your head.)(Gununu\u2026)By the way, neither of them could read thoughts or use lip-reading, but for some reason, such an exchange was possible only for now.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s wonderful to hear his voice live like this.\u201dAs a fan, being able to hear his live voice as Haishin was the best moment.Not only Maria but also Alphana blushed and occasionally trembled while looking at Kanata\u2019s back, but what they were doing was anyone\u2019s guess\u2026\u201cI thought today I might share a story with everyone. It\u2019s a new segment for reading aloud, not a casual chat or letter corner!\u201dMaria listened eagerly to Kanata\u2019s words.While Maria was actually listening to Kanata\u2019s voice, she also kept an eye on the comments coming in on her own terminal.: Reading aloud?: Like reading a picture book?: Not a picture book, maybe a book?: Is it like listening to old legends?: Maybe that\u2019s it!There were indeed written records of past legends and such in this world, and there were libraries where scholars and curious children could freely access them.Maria had seen some famous ones herself, but she was sure that the story Kanata was about to tell them was none of those.(Kanata-kun, what kind of story are you going to tell us?)With that anticipation in mind, Kanata began his story.\u201cIt happened one day. A boy woke up one morning and saw a number floating above his father\u2019s and mother\u2019s heads, each showing the number eight. The boy worried if his eyes were playing tricks on him or if he was hallucinating. The phenomenon was inexplicable.\u201dThe story Kanata began to tell had nothing to do with any written records in this world, and furthermore, it was unrealistic.However, precisely because it was an unrealistic story, Maria nodded with a light heart, thinking it was easy to empathize with it.\u201cWhen the boy went to the academy, he noticed he once again noticed the number floating above the teacher\u2019s head, though in this case, it was four. His parents were eight, and his teacher was four. The difference in numbers only deepened the mystery. Once he entered the classroom, just like before, numbers were floating above all his classmates\u2019 heads. His close friends he often spoke with had sixes or sevens, while those he didn\u2019t had fours and fives.\u201dMaria still couldn\u2019t imagine what these numbers meant. Meanwhile, Kanata, who was telling the story, continued storytelling as if he was imbuing the characters with emotion.By speaking using emphasis, he was able to draw in listeners, including Maria, into the world of the story.\u201cThe boy looked at the numbers and thought, \u2018Could this possibly indicate everyone\u2019s favorability towards me?\u2019 His parents were eight, so he thought the upper limit was around ten\u2026 Until he saw the number above the academy\u2019s most beautiful girl. It was thirty, and the boy was devastated.\u201dFrom then on, Kanata continued telling the story. Essentially, the stories in this world are legends or tales about swordsmen and magicians, so the story Kanata told was fresh.(\u2026 So, is the setting that the girl\u2019s favorability is skyrocketing?)The story was based on a certain misunderstanding, as the boy thought the upper limit of favorability was around ten, but the heroine had a value of thirty, which made him think that maybe it was a hundred. If the upper limit is a hundred, then even his parents and friends, rated lower than ten, would have the lowest evaluation. The boy would become despondent as he thought about it.(However, even though the limit was originally ten, that girl\u2019s love for him was too strong, and she broke through the limit\u2026 I see.)Maria was quick to understand.It was a story about the daily life of a protagonist and the girl who had exceeded the limit level of fondness, but it focused on the protagonist being overwhelmed by her too-strong feelings.\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s the gist of it. Well then, we\u2019ll end it here today, where the main character is faced with such heavy emotions and what will happen in the end.\u201dOf course, the word yandere did not exist in this other world, so Kanata explained the concept.[EDN: Well, well, well.]\u201cHuh, are you so curious about what happens next?\u201dIt was a story that captured the listeners\u2019 hearts with things they had never read or heard of before and made them think of a completely different world. In fact, Maria was so excited to know what would happen to the boy next and how the girl would show her affection to him.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m curious about what happens next, too.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 but wait, isn\u2019t that heavy girl like Alphana?\u201d\u201cHow rude. I just purely admire Kanata-sama!\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201dMaria strongly nodded, as she didn\u2019t want to become a burden to the boy she liked, like the heavy girl that appeared in the story Kanata told her.By the way, Kanata\u2019s storytelling was quite popular, with many asking for its continuation. It wasn\u2019t only this kind of story, but they also wanted several stories with female protagonists to be shared as well.Furthermore, there was even a suggestion to make Kanata\u2019s stories into books\u2026 He was strengthening his influence in various ways.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: *Hidden*It was the morning of the second day of Kanata\u2019s stay in Roggin.\u201c\u2026 Huuuh~\u201dAs he yawned and sat up, Kanata tilted his head in confusion.Perhaps because he wasn\u2019t in his usual dormitory room, he was a bit groggy and had forgotten that he was back home.\u201c\u2026 Oh, right. I am back home at Roggin.\u201dFinally, his brain started functioning properly, and he remembered.He hadn\u2019t come back alone; but with two people of privileged status in the Kingdom. Kanata let out a small sigh as he realized this.\u201cThings really escalated quickly and were approved, huh?\u201dSince Kanata didn\u2019t know about the Goddess\u2019s involvement, he couldn\u2019t come up with any other answer after tilting his head in confusion.The truth was probably something that only Isla could explain, but even after thinking for a while, Kanata still couldn\u2019t figure it out.\u201cWell, I guess I should get up.\u201dKanata sat up and left the room.Even though they were close, it wasn\u2019t an option for him to sleep in the same room as the girls. They all stayed in a hastily prepared room.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the small space.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine with it!\u201dKanata\u2019s house was by no means magnificent, and the rooms were much smaller than the places the girls used to stay at, like the dormitories. However, they didn\u2019t complain at all, which Kanata and his parents appreciated.\u201cWake up\u2026 Hey, hey\u2026\u201dKanata had let his guard down because he was at his family home.He tried to open the door to the girls\u2019 room without even knocking but quickly pulled his hand back.However, approaching the room would immediately make that one girl suspicious of Kanata\u2019s presence.\u201cIs it Kanata-sama?\u201d\u201cOh, Kanata-kun? Aren\u2019t you coming in?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dMaria\u2019s and Mira\u2019s voices could be heard.Even if he got caught, Kanata was more puzzled by their confusion about him not entering the room.\u201cAren\u2019t you guys in your sleepwear?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m not coming\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Please, come inside.\u201dAs Kanata turned to reject the offer, the door opened. It was Maria, wearing the same sleepwear as the night they slept together in the Principality. Though her clothes were not as dishevelled and provocative as back then, there was still something alluring about a woman\u2019s appearance right after waking up.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cHere come.\u201d\u201cH-hey\u2026\u201dMaria led Kanata into the room. It was strange how the usually unused room seemed to become more vibrant with just three women in it.(And the smell is amazing\u2026)It was a heavenly scent, like that of flowers. It made Kanata feel light-headed, but at the same time, it woke up his still somewhat sleepy mind.However, he couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit nervous, as it was his own home, after all. He tried to compose himself by tightening his expression.\u201cKanata-kun, why are you staring at me so seriously?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Pfft.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe felt a bit happy that they had become closer to the point he was teased like this, but at the same time, he felt embarrassed.This life, where he reincarnated into another world, obtained infinite magic power, and was now getting closer to beautiful girls like them, was undoubtedly wonderful\u2026 But because he wasn\u2019t used to being around women, his heart was pounding.\u201cAlphana is still sleeping. Well, it\u2019s not too late at this hour.\u201d\u201cShe hasn\u2019t moved since she closed her eyes last night.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201dIt seemed Alphana was a heavy sleeper.Maria was looking at Alphana\u2019s beautiful sleeping face. Her sleepwear would have been perfect if it wasn\u2019t for the Haishin-sama shirt. With both hands placed on her stomach, her ample b*****s moved up and down in rhythm with her breathing.\u201c\u2026 Wearing that when you sleep?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been wearing it since it was made. I wear it when I sleep in the dorm too.\u201d\u201cI wear it before going to bed too. The fabric is gentle on the skin and makes it easy to sleep.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s certainly true.\u201dAlthough he wasn\u2019t wearing it in front of his family, Kanata understood the feeling because he also wore it when he slept.\u201cSuu\u2026 suu\u2026\u201dAs he sat down next to sleeping Alphana, her body moved slightly.Although they told him she hadn\u2019t changed position, she turned her body towards Kanata, who sat down next to her and curled up her back.\u201cDid she unconsciously react because Kanata-kun came over?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 That\u2019s a happy thing.\u201dEven though it was embarrassing, he was happy to get a reaction like this.\u201cWell, it\u2019s my win anyway. After all, at that time, Kanata-kun and I were sleeping facing each other, right?\u201d\u201cYes. But I looked to make sure nothing happened.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was quite an event, and it seemed like it would become a teasing topic for the future.\u201c?\u201d\u201cAra.\u201d\u201cSo cute\u2026\u201dAlphana\u2019s finger lightly touched Kanata\u2019s clothes.She weakly grasped them as if not wanting to let go, making it difficult to pull away.Alphana had considerable adult charm, but she was short. When she slept like this, she looked very young.Kanata reached out and touched Alphana\u2019s hair, gently stroking it without waking her up.\u201c\u2026 Maybe I should have pretended to be asleep too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too late now.\u201dMaria\u2019s lips twitched at Mira\u2019s calm quip, knowing she was right.Kanata laughed at the exchange between a princess and a former assassin and once again realized the abnormality of having such important people in his house.\u201cIt\u2019s really not normal. That Maria and Alphana are here.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s true. But since we got permission, it\u2019s too late now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d and Kanata sighed.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026 No, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dSuddenly falling silent, Maria continued to stare at Kanata\u2019s hand as he petted Alphana\u2019s head.Kanata thought maybe Maria wanted him to pet her too, but it didn\u2019t seem like it. Maria had been thinking about something all along.\u201c\u2026 So you were awake, huh?\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re up?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Kanata-sama?\u201dFinally, Alphana opened her eyes.But she still seemed a bit dazed, with only half of her eyelids raised, and she didn\u2019t seem to recognize Kanata\u2019s presence very clearly.\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. Alphana tends to be a bit groggy in the morning. Maybe\u2014\u201dJust as Maria said that, Alphana\u2019s arm slithered around Kanata\u2019s waist like a snake.\u201cKanata-sama\u2026 Fuhehe \u266a\u201d\u201c\u2026 Oh, it\u2019s just as I thought.\u201d\u201cHer sleeping posture is great, but this is what she\u2019s like when she wakes up.\u201dAlphana not only wrapped her arm around Kanata\u2019s body but also rubbed her cheek against his groin, which was quite troublesome.But soon after, Alphana fully woke up, which was a relief for Kanata.\u201cUm\u2026 I feel like I did something unnecessary\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201dWell, from a man\u2019s perspective, it was definitely a reward or a blissful moment.\u201cIt\u2019s a nice place, but we have to leave by early afternoon, right?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too bad\u2026\u201dActually, they had planned to stay for about three days.However, since Maria and Alphana were here, they decided to stay for only a day and leave in the early afternoon, considering the distance back to the capital.\u201cI\u2019m glad you feel that way. If you like my hometown, there\u2019s nothing more I could ask for.\u201dKanata couldn\u2019t be happier if someone liked his hometown. He smiled, thinking it would make his parents, village chief and other villagers happy.But in this other world, Kanata seemed to be liked by troublesome people.\u201cWell, well, yesterday I was completely blown away by the appearance of the princess and the saint\u2026 but after getting used to the noise, it makes me feel lonely.\u201d\u201cYeah, I know what you mean. Hey Kanata, you\u2019ll come back again, right?\u201d\u201cOf course, I will.\u201dUpon hearing this, Maria and the others nodded in agreement, and Kanata promised to bring everyone back with him next time.The scene was a bustling but warm family atmosphere that unfolded since morning. But for the second time, Kanata was well-liked for all the trouble he had to go through.\u201cAh, here it is!\u201dIt was the voice of a very young girl. As the sound came from the other side of the door, it suddenly opened with a loud noise, revealing a girl standing there.\u201cA girl?\u201d\u201cNo, she is\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 A demon?\u201dYes, the sudden appearance was that of a demon girl. She appeared to be around five years old, with distinctive green hair and eyes that reminded one of Mint, whom they had met yesterday.[EDN: Oh no.]\u201cA demon girl?\u201d\u201cHmm, I see. So there are even young demon children like this,\u201d his parents reacted calmly, seeming to be used to demons since they had been saved by some before.As everyone pondered who the girl might be, she suddenly threw a huge bombshell.\u201cDaddy!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dThe girl pointed at Kanata and called him \u2018Daddy.\u2019At that moment, Maria and Alphana turned their eyes to Kanata with incredible force, and even his parents stared at him in surprise, while only Mira remained engrossed in her meal.\u201cDaddy!\u201dKanata held up the girl who had embraced him and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything!\u201dIt was Kanata\u2019s cry, \u201cHow can I have a child when I am still a virgin?\u201dAt the very end of his return to his hometown, Kanata was greeted by an indescribably big event.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: That Certainly Lit A FireThe girl called Kanata \u2018Daddy\u2019 and clung to him as if she were his daughter, not letting go.Kanata was naturally confused, and Maria and Alphana were also wondering what was going on, but they quickly calmed down and sorted things out.\u201cJudging from her appearance, she looks like that Alraune?\u201d\u201cIt seems so. She called herself Mint, right?\u201d\u201cOh, do you know Mama?\u201dIt seems like a bingo moment. However, as far as Kanata was concerned, his encounter with Mint was just last night, and he had no memory of having a night with her; he was still a virgin.(Don\u2019t tell me I did something so enviable without knowing it! No, wait. What\u2019s there to envy when you have a kid!? Anyway, I didn\u2019t do it!)Setting aside the fact that all criminals say that, it is certain that Kanata did nothing.As everyone looked at the girl, they heard that voice from last night.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dThe one who came in after opening the door was Mint.Clad in the same Haishin-sama shirt as yesterday, she appeared, and the girl\u2019s eyes lit up as she headed toward her.\u201cMama!\u201d\u201cOh my, you went to Daddy\u2019s place right away, didn\u2019t you?\u201dAnd Mint smiled.Her smile was beautiful, but what Kanata and the others wanted at that moment was an explanation of the situation, not that smile.\u201cPlease calm down. I\u2019ll explain everything.\u201dAlthough her voice was drawn-out, Mint slowly explained everything from scratch.First, the girl\u2019s name was apparently named Yua, and she was born early this morning.\u201cHey, remember how you poured a lot of your magical power into me? Thanks to that, I ended up getting pregnant. High-quality magical power is like a seed to us, you know.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata couldn\u2019t close his open mouth.He didn\u2019t know how the breeding system of the Alraune race worked, but apparently, they become pregnant just by having magical power poured into them like that.She was supposed to have just received a small amount of his magical power, but Kanata was so high-quality that she became obsessed and ended up extracting a lot.\u201cIs that really possible\u2026?\u201d\u201cWell. I mean, she was already bloated at that point\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd she was squirming\u2026\u201dKanata reminisced about that really erotic scene.Mint also seemed excited and began talking about what had happened at that time.\u201cIt was amazing, you know? After that, I found out that this child was in my stomach. The feeling of the magical power you gave me when she was born\u2026 I\u2019m addicted to it. It\u2019s like being in a constant state of o****m\u2014\u201d\u201cOkay, I get it, don\u2019t say any more!!\u201dKanata cut off Mint\u2019s words because it was becoming too sensitive.Yua had fallen asleep, maybe because they were talking about something too difficult for her to understand. So they couldn\u2019t speak too loudly anymore.Later, when his parents went out to work in the fields, they finally had time to talk openly about various things.\u201cHaishin-sama? This child was born by chance, and I was already planning to have children for the sake of future generations, so it just happened sooner than expected. We won\u2019t inconvenience you. I\u2019ll take care of this child properly.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201dIn other words, she said he didn\u2019t have to do anything.From Kanata\u2019s perspective, it was an event that occurred completely without his knowledge and without his intention. He felt a little like the lowest man who irresponsibly had a child but didn\u2019t know about it. However, for now, Kanata said this out loud.\u201cWell, I am one of the reasons for this, so if there\u2019s anything troublesome, let me know.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is that alright?\u201d\u201cOf course. And\u2026\u201dKanata looked at Alphana, who was holding Yua in her arms.Maria and Mira, including Alphana, found the sleeping child cute and peered at the child\u2019s face while saying she was so cute.Apparently, they were quite stimulated by their maternal instincts.\u201cWell, this might also be fate in a way.\u201d\u201cIs that so? I\u2019m happy to hear you say that.\u201dHowever, he would need to return to the demon world and talk to Shrouza again.Although Maria and the others tilted their heads, wondering why Shrouza\u2019s name was mentioned, they could feel relieved with her support.(\u2026 Will I get scolded for something this time?)He couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy, but for now, it might be safe to say that Yua\u2019s situation was resolved. Afterward, Mint left the village with Yua.As previously mentioned, it was a completely unexpected encounter with Yua, but Kanata accepted it as fate.\u201cA child\u2026 It\u2019s something cute, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes. I admire it when I see them like that.\u201dIt seemed the two of them also shared that sentiment.Kanata didn\u2019t realize it, but the two looked at him with renewed feelings.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t understand the meaning behind their gazes, but it was undoubtedly related to him.Although Mint and Yua would be concerned about through Shrouza, even on the last day of their stay, Kanata\u2019s way of spending time remained unchanged.While keeping an eye on Maria, who continued to enjoy working in the fields, Kanata and Alphana spent their time with the village chief, as usual.\u201cOnce again, Saint-sama, thank you for caring about the village.\u201d\u201cOh no, it\u2019s something we had to do sooner or later.\u201dThe village chief deeply bowed to Alphana.He didn\u2019t know why Alphana had actually taken action, and Kanata had no intention of currying favour, so he didn\u2019t bother mentioning it.\u201cHowever\u2026 Why was it at that timing?\u201d\u201cOh, well\u2026\u201dBut it seemed Alphana would explain.She turned her gaze to Kanata, and the village chief facing her also looked at Kanata wondering what had happened.Alphana smiled slightly and continued her words,\u201cI had an opportunity to talk about Kanata-sama\u2019s hometown. I heard about the inconvenience of the road leading to the village at the time. I wanted to thank Kanata-sama, so I also made efforts for that reason.\u201d\u201cKanata, you\u2026\u201dKanata scratched his cheek, feeling a bit embarrassed.Then the village chief asked Alphana a question that had been on his mind,\u201cSometimes Saint-sama, why do you call Kanata that way?\u201d\u201cWell, you see\u2026\u201dAlphana smiled and took Kanata\u2019s arm. She leaned her head against his shoulder and continued,\u201cBecause I admire him \u266a.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Mugoh!?\u201dKanata\u2019s heart skipped a beat, but the village chief seemed more shocked by her words, holding his chest in a mild case of breathlessness. Though he tried to catch his breath, he was still surprised.Kanata thought it wasn\u2019t that surprising, but he couldn\u2019t help but smile wryly.\u201cWell\u2026 please don\u2019t take it too seriously, Village Chief.\u201d\u201cOh my, I\u2019m serious, though.\u201dAs if to attack, Alphana intensified her approach.After a while, the village chief regained his composure, but as Kanata was just a commoner and Alphana was a saint, he couldn\u2019t completely believe it.\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll take my leave now.\u201d\u201cThank you very much for your valuable time.\u201dKanata and Alphana walked slowly through the village and returned to Maria and Mira. While watching Maria planting vegetable seeds with the village children, Kanata sat on a bench and spoke.\u201cAlphana.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThank you so much, not only for Maria but for everything.\u201d\u201cOh no, please don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dEven though she said that he couldn\u2019t fully express his gratitude no matter how many times he thanked her.However, when they were together like this, the more he felt grateful to Alphana, the more he hated himself for not giving her an answer to his confession.(\u2026 I, really.)Somewhere in his heart, he felt like he wasn\u2019t someone a wonderful woman like her would like, and it was certainly true that he belittled himself that way.Even though she said not to worry about it, it was only natural for him to worry since he was just a normal person if we left his Haishin persona aside.\u201cJust date her already. What\u2019s the point in worrying?\u201d Only those who know nothing would say that.It\u2019s okay to think it over as much as you want.After all, humans always live in a state of uncertainty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: How To Spend The Rest Of The HolidaysIt was the day after Kanata returned from the Roggin village.The precious memories cultivated in his hometown would continue to live on in him, with events strongly engraved in his heart and memory. Although he had returned to the capital city, Kanata spent his time leisurely since he still had some days off.\u201cHaah, I was really surprised by Shrouza\u2019s sudden visit.\u201dNow, while enjoying his vacation in such a relaxed manner, Kanata was abruptly visited last night. He returned to the dormitory the evening after coming back from Roggin, and upon returning from the bath, he found Shrouza and Lucia in his room.\u201cKanata!!\u201dHe was first surprised by their presence, but then he was cornered by Shrouza as if to dispel his surprise. Kanata was perplexed, but when he thought it might be about Mint, he was correct.\u201cMint reported that she had a child with you!! What the h**l is going on!?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Kanata-kun! Why did you sleep with her before me!?\u201d\u201cEnough! Both of you, calm down!\u201dHe was worried his voice might have reached the nearby guys\u2019 room. Although he was taken aback by Lucia\u2019s candid words, he was more concerned about making a mistake before her, a succubus, and being sucked dry.\u201cHaa, I\u2019m really tired.\u201dMint had apparently skipped over some details, which led to Shrouza and Lucia\u2019s surprise visit. After explaining the situation, they left, relieved. However, due to the fatigue of his journey and the commotion caused by their visit, Kanata fell asleep that night without streaming.\u201cI wonder why they care so much.\u201dKanata did not believe that Shrouza and Lucia were in love with him. He knew that they liked him, but that was about it. Thus, he believed the reason they were so concerned about Mint was probably due to their perception that demonkind was like a family as a whole.\u201cAssuming I\u2019m doing the livestream today\u2026 I\u2019m a bit bored.\u201dKanata muttered while looking at his watch.In the first place, he had only planned to go back home for the holidays and had not thought about going anywhere far away.\u201cI\u2019ll be spending time with my family in the castle.\u201d\u201cI have a meeting for the harvest festival at the church.\u201dMaria would be spending her time in the castle, while Alphana seemed to be busy with a meeting for the harvest festival organized by the church.Although Maria would be with her family, it would be fortunate for Alphana if going to Kanata\u2019s hometown could serve as a break for her.\u201cAnd Mira\u2019s on her way to the Empire\u2026\u201dIt might be an exaggeration to call Mira, who always clings to Kanata\u2019s side, the embodiment of chaos, but she has also returned to her hometown. She said she didn\u2019t have anything special to do there and would return soon, but for now, Mira is not in the capital city.\u201cI will bring back souvenirs unique to the Empire! Of course, for Maria-sama and Alphana-sama too!\u201dKanata felt excited about what kind of souvenir she would bring back, even though it was somewhat suspicious.\u201cWell then, should I take a stroll outside?\u201dIf he has free time, he usually takes a walk outside, and that\u2019s also part of Kanata\u2019s routine.He grabbed his belongings and stepped outside, where he was welcomed by a commotion, unlike the empty quiet dormitory it was.Even though the academy was on a long holiday, people who ran stores in the capital city were actively conducting their businesses.\u201cCome to think of it. I haven\u2019t seen the guild much around here.\u201dWhile strolling through the streets, Kanata suddenly realized he had never really seen the guild before.As a building where adventurers, who lived for the thrill and danger of their profession, would gather, he was curious about it and decided to head towards it.\u201cCome on in!\u201d\u201cWe have some good fish today!\u201d\u201cHow about these fruits?\u201d\u201cHey, kid! We\u2019ve got some good meat! Are you hungry?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have some, old man.\u201dOn his way to the guild, he stopped at a familiar shop to buy some grilled meat. As he enjoyed the taste, he saw a certain adventurer he had seen before.\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s the guy I saw in front of the brothel.\u201dIt was a man he had seen in front of the brothel before, though he couldn\u2019t remember when exactly. Back when he saw him, he seemed timid, but now, holding a request paper in hand as he walked out of the guild, he looked like a seasoned adventurer.\u201cThere aren\u2019t any restrictions on going in and out. Let\u2019s go check it out.\u201dKanata entered the guild without hesitation. Inside there were both strong-looking men and women, some of whom were taller than Kanata and had clearly defined abs.\u201c\u2026 Hou~\u201dIt was an impressive sight. No one paid any attention to Kanata, a mere civilian. Each group was huddled together or staring intently at the request bulletin board.\u201cThey\u2019re already drinking, and it\u2019s not even noon yet.\u201dThe guild building also served as a bar, and Kanata saw a group of people drinking despite the early hour. They seemed to have reserved a corner for themselves and were probably planning to hold a large party.\u201cWe got some great items today! Everyone, drink up!!\u201d\u201cThanks for the treat!!\u201d\u201cHey, our leader is the best!\u201dKanata guessed that they must have achieved something amazing in the dungeon. Perhaps they were a well-known or powerful party, but Kanata was not interested, so he continued to explore the building, finding nothing of particular interest.\u201c\u2026?\u201dAs soon as he stepped out of the building, he bumped into someone.\u201cOh, sorry\u2026\u201dIt was the voice of a timid-looking boy. Since he had been hit from behind, it meant that someone had pushed him.\u201cHey, don\u2019t inconvenience civilians, you weakling.\u201d\u201cYeah, scram off, trash.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201dKanata quickly understood the situation: the boy was being mocked by two men and a woman.(Oh, here it is. It was mentioned in a letter, but I never thought I\u2019d actually see it.)It was a classic event among adventurers.Typically, those looked down upon would reveal hidden abilities, but it was unclear whether this young boy had any. Before Kanata could say anything, they had already entered the building.\u201cWhy do people have to look down on each other? If they just cooperated and supported each other, it would be better,\u201d Kanata thought.Perhaps it was simply human nature.Since there was nothing he could do about it, Kanata left the guild and resumed wandering around town.\u201cOh, Kanata-kun, it\u2019s you.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dKanata turned around at the sound of a familiar voice. It was Kanna, someone he knew.\u201cKanna-san\u2026\u201dHe wasn\u2019t sure if she had the day off or if she was going to work at night, but she had an off-duty vibe. However, she was still dressed provocatively, and seeing the cleavage peeking out of her open shirt brought back memories of that time.\u201cH-hello.\u201d\u201cHuh? Ah, I see. You\u2019re so cute, Kanata-kun \u266a.\u201dEven if they weren\u2019t actually doing it, any teenager who had experienced that kind of situation would react this way, Kanata thought to himself. Kanna knew how to charm men and was probably well-versed in how to treat a boy his age.\u201cYou know, it\u2019s actually quite special?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cNo one else has ever seen us together, but if any of my previous clients saw us, they\u2019d be amazed. When I\u2019m with you, Kanata-kun, I put my heart into it.\u201dShe placed a finger on her lips, closed one eye, and winked. It was an expression that perfectly blended cuteness and sexiness.\u201cWhat are you going to do for lunch, Kanata-kun?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any particular plans. I just came out because I\u2019m free.\u201d\u201cOh, well then\u2026\u201dKanna slowly approached Kanata and leaned in, placing her hand on his waist.The exquisite softness of her touch was truly wonderful and had a magical power that made one want to keep touching it.\u201cI\u2019ll just treat you to lunch. But if you want\u2026\u201dShe giggled.Later, Kanata was treated to lunch by Kanna.He wasn\u2019t swept away like before, but there was something that caught his attention.\u201cCome to think of it. I just noticed something.\u201dKanata was curious about Kanna\u2019s clothes.The outfit was revealing at the chest but had a cute mini-character design on the stomach.\u201c\u2026 is that?\u201d\u201cOh, this? Isn\u2019t it cute? It\u2019s Haishin-sama\u2019s mini-character.\u201dThat\u2019s right. It was Haishin\u2019s mini-character.It wasn\u2019t something that was sold, but rather a woman who worked at the brothel with Kanna was skilled in sewing and had made it.\u201cThis is popular among the women at the brothel. Now almost all of them wear it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Oh, I see.\u201dIt was still a bit complicated for him, but he surely found the Haishin mini-character to be kind of cute.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: And So the Raven Was Killed\u201cThis place hasn\u2019t changed at all, huh?\u201dMira murmured while looking at the buildings in the Empire she was visiting, which was quite far from the Kingdom where Kanata lived.In this world, the Kingdom had spread its development to various fields, the Principality developed focusing on magic tools, and the Empire focused on the military industry. Everyone would probably consider the Empire the most developed country in the world.\u201cI wonder if Kanata-sama would like to come with me?\u201dAlthough there was an event where he received a direct message from the Empire\u2019s Prime Minister during his stream, Kanata had no current intention of going to the Empire. As Mira\u2019s own place of residence is where Kanata is, there isn\u2019t much of a longing to visit home with him, but she still wants Kanata to experience the wonderful aspects of the Empire where she was born and raised.\u201cWhat should I get as a souvenir?\u201dMany stalls were lined up, and just like in the capital, high-end shops patronized by nobles could be seen everywhere. However, the Empire had a thicker wall between nobles and commoners than the Kingdom or Principality, and discrimination based on social status was deeply rooted.\u201cWithout my cover as the Raven, I\u2019m just a commoner\u2026 Fufu, but I\u2019m really fulfilled now. I guess it\u2019s all thanks to Kanata-sama.\u201dMaybe because she was alone now, Mira wasn\u2019t using her usual polite language towards Kanata. Her true personality was more like this, and if she interacted with Kanata like this, he would probably find her even cuter than she already was, which was a shame.Well, it was already impossible, as the polite language had already become ingrained in her.\u201cI am a fan of Haishin-sama, and even more than that, I am Kanata-sama\u2019s sword and shadow\u2026 Ah, I\u2019m really glad to be alive. From now on, I will live for Kanata-sama, no matter what.\u201dMira murmured while exuding a gloomy atmosphere.She also has faint feelings towards Kanata, but more than that, the emotion that defines her as Mira is a heart of subservience.To live for him, to exist for him, and to die for him.Although Kanata would definitely tell her not to live like that, Mira\u2019s feelings were so strong that he wouldn\u2019t be able to convince her.\u201cHey there, miss! I\u2019ve got some great fruit here. Want to try it?\u201d\u201cOh, please show me!\u201dMira, a food-loving girl, was still going strong even in the Empire.As she was a little excited about returning home after a long time, her wallet had become a little lighter, but it was within her acceptable range.\u201cMmm, delicious!\u201dShe had been mostly eating from street vendors, and her stomach was visibly full.But in the midst of her satisfaction, she happened to see something that caught her eye.\u201cWhat is this\u2026?\u201dMira murmured in surprise as she looked at a bulletin board prominently displaying an article about Raven in the Empire\u2019s timekeeping section.\u201cRaven is back! The jet-black assassin has descended onto the stage once again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThis was completely unfamiliar to her. Mira was Raven, the guise of an assassin she had inherited.\u201cWell, even if it\u2019s not me, if someone claims to be Raven, then they are Raven, but\u2026\u201dSince she had already retired as Raven, the title of Assassin didn\u2019t matter anymore. The problem was if someone did evil deeds claiming to be Raven, they would get in trouble, especially if they didn\u2019t have skills like Mira. They would get caught and executed immediately.\u201cIt\u2019s a hassle to have someone take my name. They don\u2019t know my goal. I have this side of me that\u2019s also Raven, so if someone claims to be me, it\u2019s going to be a problem, right?\u201dMira remembered what Kanata had said to her. She had heard the story about how his name had been used falsely before, which led to that conversation.\u201cI see. If someone moves around as Raven without my permission and information about it spreads all the way to the capital, it might trouble Kanata-sama\u2019s feelings. He\u2019s so kind, so he might worry even more if it\u2019s me.\u201dShe was sure that it would turn out that way.\u201cShould I erase it\u2026?\u201dWith just that, Mira muttered and disappeared into the shadows.*****The existence of Raven, not Mira, appeared recently. Its true identity is someone who, like Mira, makes a living as an assassin, but unlike her, Raven is male.\u201cHehe, just by calling myself Raven, I\u2019m getting so much work.\u201dThe man couldn\u2019t contain his laughter. He had taken on assassination jobs, but with the existence of Raven, only low-paying jobs came his way. In the Empire, if you want to request an assassination, you go to Raven. That was an unshakable reputation.\u201cHe\u2019s not here anymore. From now on, I am Raven.\u201dIt was foolish to steal someone\u2019s name, but he had some power to back it up. Although his skills were inferior to Raven, he was smart enough to adjust the difficulty of requests he could take based on his own abilities. Unlike Raven, the man used a small sickle and magic in battle so he could use a variety of killing methods.\u201c\u2026?\u201dAs an assassin, the man was sensitive to any signs of danger. He was staying in a high-class inn, but he felt a strange presence outside his room.\u201c\u2026 Who\u2019s there?\u201dThere was no answer to his question.With his sickle in hand, the man slowly approached the door.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe felt a clear, abnormal atmosphere, but this inn was managed by nobles in the name of luxury, so the enemy would make them an enemy if they caused trouble. It was a place a wise person would never cause any problems.\u201c\u2026 Alright.\u201dThe moment the man touched the door, he heard the sound of glass opening behind him. As he turned his body around quickly, he felt something grab his neck, and his body floated up.\u201cWhat!?\u201dAs he felt the pressure on his neck disappear, he realized that his surroundings had changed, and he was now outside, far away from the inn where he had been.\u201cCough\u2026 Cough!!\u201dHe no longer felt the constriction on his neck and could breathe normally again. He thought it was more important to calm himself down than to be surprised by the sudden event, so he focused on regulating his breathing while remaining vigilant.\u201cAre you the one who goes by the name Raven? I don\u2019t need you to nod. I brought you here because I was sure it was you.\u201dThe voice was hard to distinguish as male or female.The man looked ahead and saw a person dressed in black clothing\u2026 he knew that figure well.\u201cRaven!?\u201d\u201cYes, exactly. I\u2019m supposed to have retired already, but it seems some idiot is using my name.\u201d\u201cYou b*****d!\u201dThe man was sure that this was the real Raven.At that moment, he slammed a smoke bomb to the ground to create cover.\u201cFoolish. Even if you run, it\u2019s useless.\u201dHe could hear their plain voice, but the man didn\u2019t pay attention and moved his feet.He jumped from building to building, making use of his well-trained legs to achieve supersonic movement.The man was a truly skilled assassin\u2026 but his opponent was an overwhelmingly bad match.\u201cPretty fast. But compared to me, you\u2019re slow.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say!?\u201dBefore he knew it, Raven was running next to him.Suddenly, something shone, and the man was blown away, hitting a pile of rubble, immobilized.\u201cWhat the\u2026!\u201dIt was strange. It was his own leg.He had no time to stop, he had to escape, but his legs wouldn\u2019t move.\u201cMy\u2026 my leg\u2026!\u201dHis leg had been cut off.The cut was so clean their flesh and bone were severed smooth.\u201cNow, you can\u2019t escape.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me!!!\u201dHe activated a spell and tried to hit Raven with intermediate-level magic.A swirling vortex of flames was formed from the magic circle on his arm, and just as it had activated, the man\u2019s arm was severed with a sharp sound.\u201cHey, are you kidding me?\u201dIt was such a skillful move that he didn\u2019t even feel the pain.The sword Raven held in her hand embodied jet-blackness, and it shone like a gem under the moonlight.Furthermore, the red blood sticking to the sword was also beautiful, and if he didn\u2019t remember that it was his own blood, he would have been captivated by it.\u201cI did consider eliminating you at first, but I thought it wouldn\u2019t hurt to just abandon my name. However, the more I investigated the new person claiming to be \u2018Raven,\u2019 the more I realized an undeniable truth that I couldn\u2019t overlook.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe distance between the man and Raven was supposed to be twenty meters. However, before he knew it, Raven was right beside him, and their sword had already been placed against the man\u2019s neck, causing a wound to his artery.\u201c\u2026 Ah.\u201dBlood sprayed out from the corner of the man\u2019s vision.Feeling his consciousness sinking into darkness, the man heard Raven\u2019s final words.\u201cYou\u2026 accepted the assassination of Haishin-sama under the name of Raven. Even if it was just for a down payment, even if you couldn\u2019t execute it, that alone is enough for you to deserve death.\u201dAnd thus, the man\u2019s life came to an end.Although the location where the man took his last breath was in the shadows of a building, it was still a place that would easily be noticed during the day.\u201cWell, that\u2019s perfect. If you wanted to be called Raven so badly, it\u2019s fitting that you die as Raven.\u201dEverything about Raven ended in that place, that day\u2026 and Mira\u2026 She left.\u201cJob\u2019s done. Now, I have to listen to Kanata-sama\u2019s live stream!\u201dAnd with that, Mira\u2019s appearance as Raven was never seen again.She switched from her role as an assassin to that of a girl, put on her treasured earphones, and listened to Kanata\u2019s voice while letting out screams of joy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: Kanata-kun Is Feeling Under The Weather\u201cHaishin-sama is amazing! Don\u2019t you agree?!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, I suppose.\u201dKanata was enjoying his holiday as usual, but he was unexpectedly caught by a troublesome guy.\u201cOh, Haishin-sama is so wonderful! I really want to meet him! I want to know more about him!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe guy in front of Kanata was Aguila, who got punished by demons for pretending to be Haishin in the past. He was shouting about Haishin in front of Kanata.Kanata was just relaxing in the town as usual, and Aguila suddenly appeared in front of him.\u201cOh, you\u2019re wearing that too!\u201dAguila noticed Kanata was wearing the Haishin-sama shirt because he was also wearing one himself.Kanata knew that Aguila had become a devoted Haishin follower after being abducted by the demons, but this was the first time Kanata had talked to him like this.\u201cWhat do you like about Haishin-sama?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2026\u201d\u201cI love everything about him! I can\u2019t express it in words!\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201d\u201cWhat attracted you to Haishin-sama?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cI love everything about him! I can\u2019t express it enough!\u201dKanata even thought about punching him once. Aguila kept repeating the same thing even while asking for Kanata\u2019s opinion. He was a difficult listener. Kanata was happy to have fans, but he didn\u2019t want to deal with people like him.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be going now.\u201dKanata tried to leave quietly, but he got stared at and trembled.Aguila did not show any hostility towards Kanata, but his eyes filled with blind love towards Haishin were really creepy to Kanata.\u201cLet\u2019s not be like that. Why don\u2019t we talk something good about Haishin-sama?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Please spare me.\u201dThere are enthusiastic fans of Haishin in the capital, so it is natural there are fans with a similar interest as Aguila. However, it is not easy to show that in front of many people, and people looked at Kanata, who was being bothered by Aguila, with pity.\u201cI wonder if Kanata-chan is okay?\u201d\u201cThat nobleman is so creepy\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, Mom, what\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look.\u201dKanata is a commoner, but he often goes shopping, so it\u2019s no surprise he gets recognized often. That\u2019s why it became a topic when he walked with beautiful women like Maria, Alphana, and Kanna, but there was never any malice behind it.\u201c\u2026?\u201dSuddenly, the figure of Aguila in front of Kanata blurred for a moment. Kanata pressed his forehead with his hand, but what attacked him next was intense nausea.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You look pale.\u201dHe remembered this sensation. It was like symptoms of a cold from his past life and was quite severe.(Damn it, I was feeling a little sluggish when I woke up, but was it really a cold after all?)Thinking back, he realized that he had never caught a cold or any illness since he was born in this world, so he had let his guard down a bit.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m feeling a little sick.\u201d\u201cOh, I see! Then let me take you to the dormitory.\u201dThe Aguila from some time ago had disappeared, and the current Aguila treated him equally, regardless of whether he was a commoner. Although he was quite obsessed with Haishin, it seems he was quite approachable among the nobility because he could be kind like this.Kanata wrapped his arm around Aguila\u2019s shoulder and tried to walk, but then he felt an even stranger sensation.\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201dBefore he knew it, the space had switched to gray. Kanata\u2019s body was floating in the air, and Aguila, who had lent his shoulder, was frozen in that position. It was as if only Kanata had been separated from the concept of time.\u201cIs this the same as back then?\u201dBack then, it was when the Goddess Isla appeared in front of Kanata. Perhaps, Kanata was thinking about something similar when a woman suddenly appeared in front of him\u2014yes, it was the Goddess Isla.\u201cKanata. You seem to be feeling unwell.\u201d\u201cWell, kind of.\u201dKanata floated over to Isla and was held in a princess carry position. It was sudden, but he was at his limit and wanted to lie down immediately if he could.With a snap of her fingers, the scenery changed in an instant, and they had teleported from outside to Kanata\u2019s room.\u201cCome on, lie down.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dKanata gave up asking the Goddess how she knew where his room was.\u201cThe human body is so fragile. They get sick so easily, and if they lose their head, they immediately die.\u201d\u201cWell, obviously. You\u2019ll die too, won\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cDo you think a goddess would die just from losing her head?\u201d\u201cSeriously?\u201d\u201cYeah! How amazing is that, right?\u201dShe had an impressive smirk.She puffed out her chest with a thud, looking like an absolute powerhouse, saying that even if she only had her head left, she would still be alive, but Kanata shook his head when she asked if she should try it.\u201cAnyway, why did you come out at such a timing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been watching over you for a while. I\u2019m a goddess, after all.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dKanata felt something suggestive but looked away.\u201cI can\u2019t interfere too much on your side, but if something were to happen to you, I wouldn\u2019t be able to rest easy. I would be troubled if you developed a serious illness and died.\u201dIsla held Kanata\u2019s hand tightly and said so.It was truly the love a goddess should have for a human, and Kanata could feel it on his skin, but she also spoke about such ominous things.\u201cWell, if that were to happen, there would be no meaning in this world\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t say such dangerous things\u2026\u201dWhile he was very happy that she had brought him back to his room, listening to Isla\u2019s words any further would have given him a headache.As they talked, Isla\u2019s body began to glow and gradually became translucent.\u201cGood grief, this is all I can do in this world with even a little bit of power. The constraints of being a goddess are such a bother.\u201d\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d\u201cW-wait, Kanata! That \u2018Are you leaving?\u2019 with that lonely look is unfair! I\u2019ll quit being a goddess and become a normal human to be your bride! Is that alright!?\u201d\u201cYou seem tired.\u201d\u201cKyaaaa! You\u2019re supposed to nod at a time like this! Isn\u2019t it wonderful that someone as beautiful and cute as me will be your bride!?\u201dAdmittedly, Isla was beautiful and had a good figure, and he was happy that she had helped him like this, but she was also loud and dangerous\u2026 There were countless negative aspects once he started listing them off.\u201cYou know, even goddesses can be hurt by what you say?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t read my mind.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a goddess, after all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata gave her a stern look.Even so, Isla seemed to realize she didn\u2019t want to be seen as any more of a troublesome woman and decided to leave for today.\u201cI\u2019ve delivered the oracle to Alphana. She\u2019ll be here soon, so please wait.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dWith those intriguing words left hanging in the air, Isla disappeared.Kanata remained in a daze for a while, thinking about what she meant by delivering an oracle to Alphana during his encounter with Isla earlier. Before he knew it, he had fallen asleep.And then he felt the touch of cold fingers on his forehead and opened his eyes.\u201cOh, you\u2019re awake?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Alphana?\u201dWhen he opened her eyes, he saw Alphana.He wondered how he had gotten here and recalled his encounter with Isla earlier.\u201cI apologize for the suddenness. I have already informed the dormitory supervisor, and there are no problems with the harvest festival meeting, so please do not worry, Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026 I appreciate it, but\u2026\u201dHe felt bad for Alphana but was glad she came to his aid like this. It was the first time he had invited her to his room, but he didn\u2019t have the luxury of feeling nervous about it at this moment. Alphana\u2019s hand touched his forehead again, and a faint green light leaked out.\u201cIt\u2019s a healing spell. You should feel much better now.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ohh.\u201dHis body gradually relaxed as she said.However, it was only a temporary relief, and it seemed that he had to wait for time to pass before he could completely recover, like with a cold.\u201c\u2026 Fufu.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dSuddenly, Alphana burst into laughter, and Kanata asked her what was going on.\u201cIt\u2019s about when I first met you, Kanata-sama. You said you had a bump because something heavy fell on your hand.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Oh, right.\u201d\u201cTo tell you the truth, I regretted not healing you with magic back then. But then, I wondered if I had healed you, would I have ever met Kanata-sama? \u201cKanata nodded in agreement.As a saint, Alphana was a pro at healing magic, so it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal to heal the swelling on his hand. But it was precisely because she didn\u2019t do it that Kanata and Alphana were able to meet.\u201cBut I\u2019m glad it happened. If I hadn\u2019t met Alphana, I would have been too lonely.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Kanata-sama \u266a\u201dShe squeezed his hand tightly, her grip stronger.Although he had been somewhat relieved, his condition was still bad, which meant that Kanata\u2019s heart was slightly weakened.\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s okay? That it\u2019ll take time to recover?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m totally fine.\u201d\u201cWell, then. Could you stay with me for a while?\u201d\u201cYes, please let me stay by your side.\u201dAlphana smiled. Her smile was exactly that of a saint.\u201cKanata-sama, it\u2019s very\u2026 very disappointing, but please take a break from your streaming today.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine, see?\u201d\u201cPlease take a break. Will you promise me?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Y-yes.\u201dKanata later said that the smile that had gone from that of a saint to one that could put pressure on him was exactly that of a demon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: Maria Being Courted\u201cToday is the last day of the holidays, and there were a lot of things that happened.\u201dKanata reflected on the past ten days.At the start, he brought Maria, Alphana, and Mira home to meet his family and acquaint them with the locals.Then, Kanata became sick and was attended to by Alphana. In the latter half of the Holidays, he enjoyed a leisurely time in the capital without any significant disruptions.\u201cBut that was\u2026 good.\u201dKanata remembered when he was taken care of by Alphana. Although he had recovered enough to have a conversation when Alphana came to his room, there were moments when he felt too weak to even get up.Although it subsided quickly, Alphana seemed unable to relax unless she kept an eye on Kanata, so she ended up staying the night.\u201cIf your condition worsens again after I leave, I\u2019ll be worried. So today, please let me take care of you, Kanata-sama.\u201dEven for a guy, being taken care of by a beautiful girl when you\u2019re feeling unwell is probably in the top three things they want from a girl, Kanata thought to himself.However, Alphana is also a saint, so he had some concerns about her staying in Kanata\u2019s room in the boys\u2019 dormitory.\u201cI stayed at Kanata-sama\u2019s home, so it\u2019s no big deal. Besides, I already got permission from the person in charge, thinking that something like this might happen. I was surprised that the permission was granted relatively easily, but that\u2019s how it is. So, please don\u2019t worry about it, okay \u266a.\u201dWith all that said, Alphana stayed overnight. She fed him, wiped his body with a towel soaked in hot water, and slept next to him.\u201c\u2026 Seriously, how devoted is Alphana?\u201dKanata thought, having received her care and attention directly from her pure feelings for him as a girl rather than just as a compassionate saint. Her existence was significant enough for Kanata to hope he would have such time with her again if he fell ill in the future.\u201cFufu, I\u2019m sure other people besides me would do the same thing. If something like this happens again, let\u2019s tell Maria.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t keep hiding it from the princess anyways.\u201d\u00a0With such a remark, she laughed it off.\u201cWell then, before I stroll around the city again, let\u2019s go to the Magic Bank.\u201dThe Magic Bank is a bank operated by magic, where all of Kanata\u2019s income from donations on his stream and Haishin merchandise are stored.\u201cMagic really is convenient, isn\u2019t it? Even the donation system is thanks to it.\u201dAnyone with a handheld device can access the Magic Bank, and it\u2019s easy to transfer money to other accounts. The donation system simply sends money from the listener\u2019s account to Kanata\u2019s account on the stream. It\u2019s simple, but it\u2019s strange that there\u2019s no physical contact even though large sums of money are moving around. However, since he has been doing this for a long time, it\u2019s not surprising.\u201cLet\u2019s see, let\u2019s withdraw 100,000 yen for now.\u201d[EDN: About $724 USD.]Kanata withdrew ten gold coins, equivalent to 100,000 yen.\u201cBut really, the amount of money being transferred is eye-popping.\u201dOne gold coin is worth 10,000 yen, and one platinum coin is worth 100,000 yen. When you think about it, the income he\u2019s earned as Haishin is really amazing. He\u2019s not really thinking about making more money, but being rich means he doesn\u2019t have to worry about his future.\u201cThere\u2019s no tax return either. This is the best in another world!\u201dAlthough he has to pay some tax, it\u2019s not too much of a burden, so the more he earns, the warmer his wallet becomes.He withdrew money from the bank and started strolling around as usual, but it\u2019s lonely to be alone like this.\u201cMira, you here?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMira appeared beside him, and Kanata suggested they walk together, so their walk began.\u201c\u2026 Ah.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dAlthough he had wondered about it before, he was now completely used to Mira appearing immediately when called. There was no malice in Mira\u2019s gaze as she looked at Kanata, so Kanata chuckled a little and patted her head.\u201cUm, well\u2026\u201d\u201cMira really is like a little sister to me.\u201d\u201cSister\u2026 Am I Kanata-sama\u2019s little sister?\u201d\u201cYeah. Somehow, aside from Maria and Alphana, I spend a lot of time with Mira.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMira repeated several times that she was Kanata-sama\u2019s little sister.Afterwards, she smiled happily, so Kanata\u2019s words must have been very kind to her.\u201cKanata-nii-sama\u2026 Hmm, Kanata-sama sounds better.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve gotten used to that too.\u201dSo they both chuckled and decided not to use \u2018brother\u2019 or \u2018sister.\u2019Then Kanata and Mira were walking around town, but when they passed by the guild, they felt an unusual commotion.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cI wonder what it is.\u201dKanata and Mira looked inside the building, where four men and women with sturdy appearances were being sympathized with by many people.\u201cI can\u2019t believe they cleared that dungeon!\u201d\u201cWhite Fang is amazing, after all!!\u201d\u201cIs that the legendary sword they found in the deepest part!?\u201dIt seems a party called White Fang had cleared one of the toughest dungeons. It was a dungeon no other adventurer from any country had been able to complete until now. It was highly anticipated which country\u2019s adventurers would be the first to clear it.\u201cThey probably went to the Illusion Spine, located between the Kingdom and the Empire. I heard that magical beasts living there are powerful, and there have been many confirmed deaths.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dThe toughest dungeon was a place where adventurers were always close to death, but it was also a place of dreams. Kanata might be able to use his infinite magic cheat to clear it, but it didn\u2019t matter to him anymore.\u201cAnyway, it doesn\u2019t matter. Let\u2019s go, Mira.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dSince neither Kanata nor Mira were particularly interested in their achievements, they resumed their walk, snuggling up like siblings.****\u201cWell done. I never thought we would have a conqueror of Illusion Spine from our country.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an honour to hear your kind words. I wanted to achieve something that would allow me to have an audience with the king.\u201d\u201cHou?\u201dThe White Fang members in front of him bowed their heads. Their achievements were worth the blessing of the kingdom\u2019s top leaders.(\u2026 I can\u2019t wait for it to be over.)Meanwhile, Maria, wearing a dress and having returned to the castle, looked bored as she watched her father and their conversation.If she had returned to the dormitory yesterday, she could have spent time with Kanata or even gone to the church to help Alphana.As the Third Princess, Maria had no interest in the achievements of these adventurers\u2026 It was unbecoming of a princess, but there was no one who could be interested in something they had no interest in.\u201cMaria, you\u2019re showing your emotions on your face?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I apologize for that.\u201dHer brother Julius scolded her, but he was likely the same.\u201cI\u2019d rather look at Haishin-sama\u2019s merchandise than this.\u201dThe Second Princess, Leona, one of Maria\u2019s sisters, had already spoken her mind.As the boring time passed like this, when the king proposed rewarding them, the leader, Matt, spoke up.\u201cMay I ask you something?\u201d\u201cVery well, speak.\u201dThere was no trace of the pitiful appearance the king had shown when facing Kanata before; there was only the strong figure of a king carrying the weight of his country.Without being intimidated by the king\u2019s overwhelming presence, Matt opened his mouth wide.\u201cMay I request for my engagement to Maria-sama?\u201dThe atmosphere in the room froze at his words.Maria herself looked foolish with her mouth open, but Matt continued his words as if feeling a sense of accomplishment.\u201cI\u2019ve been smitten with her since I first saw her. I was already a successful adventurer but I have always wanted to be with her. That\u2019s why I thought that merely being an adventurer wasn\u2019t enough, and achieved what I have now. It\u2019s because of my feelings for Maria-sama.\u201dWell, it\u2019s somewhat common for someone to express their aspiration for a princess when they get some achievement. He must have worked hard just for that purpose.(\u2026 Although, from my perspective, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen him.)On the other hand, Maria had no recollection of him at all. While her older brother and sister laughed merrily next to her, the silent king spoke up.\u201cKeep your dreams to yourself. Why do I have to give my cute daughter to someone like you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201dAnd this king was quite a doting father. He thought the First and Second Princesses were adorable, but he was even more indulgent with Maria and her younger sisters. Even if it was to strengthen ties between nations, there was no way he would give them away in marriage.\u201cFeel free to express other wishes. But my daughters are off-limits.\u201dMatt was dumbfounded by the absolute rejection, and Maria silently declared her love for her father.\u201cIf Maria were to be married off, it would have to be to someone as great as Haishin, so just give up.\u201dMaria then declared her love for her father even more. Matt hit the ground with his fist, looking frustrated.****\u201c\u2026 Ah-chooo~~~!!\u201dKanata let out a beautifully artistic sneeze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: Group Magic Mock Battle\u201cOh? Did that really happen?\u201d\u201cYes. I never expected to be suddenly proposed to like that either.\u201dDuring the lunch break after the long weekend, Kanata and Maria were having lunch together.Alphana was taking a break for a few days to prepare for the Harvest Festival, so Kanata and Maria were likely to spend some time together like this for a while.As it had been a few days since they last saw each other, they talked about what they had been doing during that time. Maria mentioned that she had been proposed to by the leader of White Fang.\u201cAs expected of a high-ranked adventurer. If he\u2019s that impressive, he could even propose to a princess, couldn\u2019t he?\u201dThey were undoubtedly heroes, having achieved what anyone could not accomplish until now.However, from what he heard, the king rejected the proposal, and the man called Matt went back with his shoulders drooping.\u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s because my father is a doting parent, but it bothered him that Matt thought he could marry me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s no good at all.\u201dMatt may have been a little carried away. He was celebrated by the guild and even invited to the castle, so it was natural for him to think that he could possibly win over Maria, whom he had fallen for at first sight.Well, in the end, his wish didn\u2019t come true, and he ended up facing reality.\u201cMy father said\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s someone like Haishin-sama, it\u2019s okay to marry me.\u201d\u201c!? *Cough cough* !?\u201dThat was a shocking statement to Kanata.He almost spat out the bread he was eating but managed to hold back and calm down with Maria rubbing his back.\u201cSorry about that \u266a.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Geez.\u201dHowever, those few words were a shock to Kanata.It was unknown what the king really thought, and it may have just been a joke or an example, but he did declare he would marry her to someone like Haishin.In other words, it was nothing but a fact that her parents had openly recognized him.\u201cFufu, what will you do if you can marry me, Kanata-kun?\u201d\u201c\u2026 What do you mean?\u201dMarrying Maria. How many men would wish for it? Marrying into the royal family is in a way, a promise of the future, with no problems with money or housing. Above all, having a beautiful girl like Maria as a partner would make any man happy.\u201cIf I could marry someone like Maria, it might be happiness. However, being royalty might bring some trouble.\u201dUpon hearing this, Maria shook her head and said,\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m the Third Princess, so my sister can take care of the country, and my brother is also there to help. If I marry you and leave the castle, there will be no problem, you see?\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 You\u2019re quite persuasive,\u201d Kanata commented as Maria moved closer to him, urging him not to escape.\u201cDon\u2019t run away.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Well, it\u2019s not strange for a man to step back when a woman approaches him.\u201d\u201cHmm? Is that so\u2026 Even though we slept together?\u201d\u201cT-that\u2026 That was definitely an accident!\u201dKanata insisted it was not his fault since it was clearly an accident.Maria also didn\u2019t think it was worth teasing him about it, and she just wanted to make fun of Kanata a little bit.(\u2026 Is it because Alphana is not here that Maria is getting so close to me? And the way she\u2019s looking at me is different from usual.)Feeling a little confused by the slight difference, Kanata still firmly looked back at Maria\u2019s face.\u201c\u2026 Kanata-kun, you often look into people\u2019s eyes when you talk, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cHuh? Well. If I feel embarrassed, I might look away, but I think it\u2019s important to look into the person\u2019s eyes when you talk.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. I love these moments when I\u2019m looking into your eyes like this, Kanata-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hey Maria, do you have a fever or something?\u201dWith that one word, Maria puffed up her cheeks.\u201cHow rude. I\u2019m the same as always, you know?\u201dFurthermore, as their faces drew closer, Kanata apologized and bowed his head. Of course, Maria wasn\u2019t angry, and she chuckled and told him not to worry.Until it was time to part ways, Kanata spent time with Maria, and as they said their goodbyes, Maria made this proposal:\u201cHey, Kanata-kun, would you like to go out with me on our next day off?\u201d\u201cWith you?\u201d\u201cYeah. Not too far outside the capital, there\u2019s a beautiful lake where the spirits are said to reside, just a short ride away by carriage.\u201d\u201cOh really?\u201dIt was news to Kanata. He knew that beings called spirits occasionally appeared, but he wasn\u2019t particularly interested, so he didn\u2019t know about that place.\u201cOkay, I\u2019m fine with that.\u201d\u201cUn! It\u2019s a promise, then.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dAnd so, the plan for Kanata and Maria to go out together was set. After parting ways with Maria, he returned to the classroom, and the afternoon classes began.(What kind of topic should I talk about today? Some have asked me to do another reading-aloud session, and the mail corner is always popular\u2026 Man, being popular is tough.)Kanata wasn\u2019t paying attention to the teacher\u2019s words during class, just letting them flow in one ear and out the other. It was evident that he was completely relaxed, knowing that it was the last class of the day, but since many other students were dozing off, Kanata was one of the better ones.(Lately, there haven\u2019t been any negative letters or anything that makes me feel sick\u2026 A peaceful world without conflict is truly wonderful.)Kanata nodded to himself.Now, the teacher began to speak about something interesting as they neared the end of class.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s sudden, I\u2019ll announce it now. Next month, our academy and the Empire\u2019s academy will be holding a group magic mock battle.\u201dHearing the words \u2018group magic mock battle,\u2019 Kanata looked towards the teacher.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dThe classroom was in an uproar. There were many students, like Kanata, who looked bewildered.\u201cI don\u2019t know the detailed content yet, but we will select several tens of students from S-class or higher to conduct a mock battle. It will probably be to capture territory, but of course, safety will be taken into consideration.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dKanata was excited about the inter-academy mock battle, which seemed very much otherworldly, although the details were still unclear. There was some concern due to the unsettling movements in the Empire, but as Kanata had nothing to do with the country\u2019s affairs, he couldn\u2019t do much about it.\u201cWell then, everyone, good work.\u201dFinally free, Kanata immediately left the academy. He planned to go to the church, where Alphana was busy with preparations, and bring her some treats.\u201cHmm?\u201dOn the way to the church, there is a brothel called Veneti, where Kanna worked, but the entrance seemed quite noisy.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dStopping his footsteps and pushing his way through the watching residents, Kanata approached the entrance and then heard a man\u2019s angry voice.\u201cI\u2019m a customer! How dare you complain to me about anything!?\u201d\u201cYes, you are a customer. However, it is unacceptable to force our employees to do things they do not want to do.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think I am!? I am\u2014\u201d\u201cI know you are Matt from White Fang, but what does that have to do with anything?\u201d\u201cHmph\u2026\u201dApparently, the one causing the disturbance was Matt.\u201c\u2026 So this guy is Matt, huh? I see, so he\u2019s the one who proposed.\u201dKanata didn\u2019t know his name when he saw him with Mira, but he heard the name Matt from Maria, so he knew he was the man who proposed.Maria had given Kanata the impression that he was a refreshing man, but he appeared to be in a bad mood, and his expression was enough to scare women.\u201cDamn\u2026 Damn\u2026 They\u2019re underestimating me!!\u201dMatt muttered curses as he walked away.When Kanata asked about what had happened, he found out that Matt had been in a bad mood ever since he entered the brothel and had treated the woman he requested poorly.It wouldn\u2019t have been surprising if he had been banned from a brothel like Veneti for causing a scene, but it seemed like he was really in a bad mood.\u201cI wonder if it\u2019s because things didn\u2019t work out well with Maria\u2026?\u201dThat\u2019s what Kanata thought, but surprisingly, he wasn\u2019t entirely wrong. However, since Kanata had no contact with him, he had no way of knowing.Nevertheless, Kanata believes that no matter how bad his mood is, it\u2019s wrong to take it out on a woman, and it\u2019s the lowest thing a man can do.\u201cWait! If people find out that I\u2019m close to Maria, will I be assassinated or something?\u201dKanata\u2019s spine shuddered a little at the thought, but then he remembered Mira\u2019s smile with her thumb up, which seemed to wash away that fear.\u201cWell, it seems like it\u2019ll be okay.\u201dAnd although it was a bit of a stretch, Mira\u2019s presence was a reassuring factor for Kanata.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: The Phrase \u2018Fate Is Cruel\u2019 Is A Good One, Isn\u2019t It?\u201cEnough already. What gives you the right to take our earnings and squander them at a brothel!?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dOne day, Matt was reprimanded by his party members.Although it\u2019s not entirely accurate to say he was being reprimanded, Matt was clearly in the wrong and was being advised against his actions.\u201cCome on, Matt. What\u2019s gotten into you?\u201dDespite recently achieving a great victory at the White Fang, their bonds were on the brink of falling apart.It all started when Matt began to spend recklessly, melting away their funds at brothels and gambling. And it wasn\u2019t just his own share of the money, but also funds from the party\u2019s savings.\u201cShut up! Don\u2019t you dare question me!!\u201dMatt lay sprawled on the sofa without a hint of remorse.Seeing him like that, the two male and two female party members shook their heads in disbelief and left.(\u2026 Dammit, she was my first love\u2026 My first love!!)It was nothing more than a simple case of an infatuation gone wrong.Matt had fallen for the Third Princess, Maria, who was known as one of the Kingdom\u2019s treasures. He had been captivated by her at an event where the royal family appeared in public to convey their message to the people.\u201cI have nothing\u2026 but if I become strong enough to meet the princess, then surely Maria and I\u2026!\u201dDreams are free, but whether or not they come true is another matter entirely.Although breaking through a high-difficulty dungeon was a great achievement in itself, it was still impossible for him to become engaged to the princess.Of course, if Maria had fallen in love with Matt, the situation may have been different, but unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201cI understand\u2026 I really do. But it\u2019s not enough\u2026 No, it\u2019s because my wish was too much!\u201dMatt understood in his heart that it was impossible. But dreams must be pursued, no matter how impossible they may seem. If you continue to pursue them, you will eventually reach them, so he never doubted that. This is why his failure was so devastating.\u201cHaah\u2026\u201dFeeling sorry for shouting at his party members, Matt took the Haishin-sama badge, one of his treasures, in his hand.\u201cHaishin-sama\u2026 What should I do if you are brought up? I know I can\u2019t beat you\u2026 but it\u2019s frustrating!\u201dBy the way, he is a big fan of Haishin. He punched the ground because he was faced with the fact that he could not get the girl named Maria.\u201cI\u2026 I will\u2026\u201d\u201cI will never forgive Haishin-sama for being brought up,\u201d He would never think that.This is because Matt has enjoyed a lot of time watching his stream and has become so obsessed that he buys merchandise like this.When the badge was previously released, he even raised his voice to those who thought Haishin was annoying\u2026 so he didn\u2019t know where to put his feelings.\u201cCome to think of it, there was an adventurer who got betrayed by his childhood friend.\u201dWhile crying, he suddenly remembered a letter from a previous broadcast. He had been waiting for his childhood friend in his hometown, but she was dating the leader of a famous party and was being oppressed.Haishin had said kind words to encourage him about this.\u201cLove is complicated, isn\u2019t it? Well, don\u2019t rot just because you\u2019ve been rejected.\u201dIn this case, it\u2019s not like he got rejected, but Haishin\u2019s words still had power.\u201cCompared to that, my situation is small. But\u2026 it\u2019s so painful to give up on Maria-sama\u2026 Arghhh!!\u201dHe struggled with his thoughts for a while but eventually returned to his usual self.His new goal was to grow as a greater adventurer and become a stronger man.\u201cI won\u2019t give up! So please watch over me, Haishin-sama! With your words in my heart, I\u2019ll work even harder!!\u201dHe thrust his fist towards the sky.Although he had regained his usual composure, fate was cruel, and the king\u2019s words at that time were somewhat accurate.Maria, the princess who had captured his heart, was in love with Kanata, the person behind Haishin.Fate was indeed cruel.****\u201cLet\u2019s get started with today\u2019s stream! Everyone, thanks for coming.\u201dIt was the night when a certain adventurer held a new goal in his heart.Kanata started his usual stream, but he looked a little different than usual.\u201cSorry, I haven\u2019t had dinner today. So I\u2019m going to chat with everyone while I eat.\u201dActually, after he returned from the academy, he was so tired that he fell asleep in his bed. He slept for a long time, and when he woke up, he had missed the time when the dormitory cafeteria was open.\u201cWell, it\u2019s convenient to have some reserves in times like this. Thanks for the meal.\u201dKanata had saved some food for when he was hungry. It was a simple dish of bread and meat, but it was quite large, so it would be enough to fill his stomach.\u201cTa-da!\u201d: Looks delicious.: Oh, you\u2019ve already taken a bite\u2026: Haishin-sama, I like the shape of your teeth.: Exciting.: There are only idiots here.: Isn\u2019t it too late for that?: I\u2019ll buy it for whatever price you say!\u201cStop it. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201dKanata said, showing the bitten food on the screen while streaming. The comments section was filled with people with eccentric and strange tastes.It was creepy, so Kanata honestly voiced his opinion, but he remembered that there was something similar to ASMR chewing sounds in his past life.(I won\u2019t make a sound of chewing, it\u2019s gross.)Although he won\u2019t make the chewing sound, his speech inevitably became a bit slurred while he was eating.\u201cOh, by the way, about the Empire\u2026 Ah! Never mind.\u201dPerhaps because he was eating while talking, he almost let slip the words as Kanata, not Haishin.Feeling as if he was talking to a neighbour, he almost mentioned the Imperial Academy and mock battles but quickly withdrew the words.: Empire?: Are you coming!?: Long live the Empire!: When is it!? Let me know, and I\u2019ll go too!: I\u2019ll be waiting for you, Haishin!!: It\u2019s festival time. Let us all celebrate, hoorayyyyy!!: The Empire should get ready to welcome Haishin!!Just him mentioning the Empire was loaded with many meanings.The comment section was in a festive mood, and Kanata broke out in a cold sweat, realizing what he had done, but at the same time, he chuckled wryly.\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited!! I\u2019m not going there now!!\u201dAnd then the comment section fell silent.Afterwards, Kanata managed to gloss over his talk about the Empire, but he had undoubtedly given the impression that Haishin had thought about the Empire in the near future.(That was almost a streaming accident. If I had mentioned the group mock battle, they would have definitely found out I\u2019m a student from the Academy.)Perhaps Maria and Alphana were also anxious about Kanata\u2019s identity being exposed, so he thought they might look troubled when they meet next time.\u201cMunch, munch\u2026 Okay, let\u2019s read just one letter.\u201dAs it was a good time, he decided to read a letter from someone who lived in the Empire.\u201cThank you very much for always providing me with enjoyable moments, Haishin-san. I doubt you would read a letter from someone like me, but I couldn\u2019t help but send it to you regardless. I am a slave living in the Empire and was recently taken in by a kind master. Although I am foolish and troublesome, many people, including my master, have treated me well. I think all of this is thanks to your words, Haishin-san, and I believe that your words have helped me through difficult times. If you ever come to the Empire, please enjoy yourself. From Kaya.\u201d\u201cDid they just put their name in there? That\u2019s not good, right?\u201dAlthough it may be a fake name, the message was very warm, so Kanata was very happy to receive it.\u201cThank you. It really makes me happy when you say things like that. Take care of yourself and do your best.\u201dAnd with that, today\u2019s stream came to an end. However, because someone had sent such a message with their name attached, Kanata decided to end it with a surprise.\u201cWell, that\u2019s it for today. Goodnight, everyone! And Kaya, have a good dream too.\u201dHe manipulated the wavelength of his magic and made an echo-like sound as if directed toward Kaya, who may or may not be watching.Although it was unclear whether Kaya actually received it, Kanata ended the stream, hoping it had reached her.Incidentally, the next day, Maria and Alphana, whom he met at the academy, were staring at him with oddly red faces, but that was to be expected.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: I Love You\u201c\u2026 Fuwaa.\u201dSeveral days had passed since the announcement of the group magic mock battle, and it was already the weekend. Kanata had been sleeping since morning.Last night, the livestream had gotten a little more attention, and he had stayed up later than usual as a result.\u201cWell, it\u2019s my day off. I can spend it freely\u2026\u201dHowever, with a vacant expression, Kanata felt like he was forgetting something.When he thought about it carefully, Maria\u2019s smile came to mind.\u201cKanata-kun! See you tomorrow \u266a.\u201dMaria had told him that when they left the academy yesterday.\u201cHer smile was so cute. What, was she looking forward to going out with me like that?\u201dThe fact that a super beautiful girl was looking forward to going out with him was something that stirred Kanata\u2019s heartstrings.\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata tilted his head in response to his unconscious mutter. Then, after staring at the clock for a few seconds, he jumped up from the bed with a start.\u201cOh no\u2026 Today is the day I go out with Maria!!\u201dYes, today was the day they had promised to go out together.The promised time was 9 o\u2019clock, and it was now 9:30, thirty minutes later than Kanata realized.Of course, if he started getting ready now and headed to the meeting place, he would be even later.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll hurry up and go. I\u2019ll apologize when I get there!\u201dAlthough he wasn\u2019t sweating profusely, Kanata\u2019s considerable sense of urgency was clearly visible.It wasn\u2019t enough to break a promise with a woman, but being late was also rude, and Kanata understood that.So he quickly got ready and headed straight to Maria.\u201c\u2026 haa\u2026 haa\u2026 Oh, there she is.\u201dThe meeting place was near the castle gate, where the carriage was parked.A beautiful woman with a well-groomed horse\u2019s coat was there\u2026 Well, it\u2019s certain that she\u2019s Maria.When she noticed Kanata approaching, Maria waved her hand with a flutter. She didn\u2019t seem angry, so Kanata felt relieved, but he still had to apologize properly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Maria! I made you wait!\u201d\u201cFufu, it\u2019s fine, Kanata-kun. I had a feeling this would happen because yesterday\u2019s stream went on for a long time.\u201d\u201cBut still\u2026\u201d\u201cI said it\u2019s fine. You came in a hurry and apologized properly. I can feel your sincerity.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dAlthough he still felt sorry, Kanata\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t good, but Maria smiled at him and took out a handkerchief from her pocket.\u201cKanata-kun, stay still.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026\u201dShe wiped the sweat off his forehead.It was a new side of Maria he had only recently noticed. She was always kind to Kanata, but now he felt it even more.(Her face is close\u2026 I already knew that, but she smells really good.)Maria, wearing a hat that blocked the sun and a dress-like outfit, looked a little fresh.\u201cWell then, shall we go?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dAnd so, Kanata and Maria left the capital using a carriage. The fact that the princess was going out with a classmate was beyond the level of a secret outing, but permission was granted for some reason.Kanata had also been curious when heading towards Roggin, but he couldn\u2019t quite understand it, as the king and queen valued Maria very much.\u201cWhat a nice horse. Should I let him run free for a bit when we get there?\u201dKanata had been lost in thought, but Maria\u2019s voice brought him back to reality.It might be strange that it\u2019s just the two of them holding the reins of a horse, but with magic, they could control everything around them, making it convenient.\u201cKanata-kun, can I come over there?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, sure\u2026\u201dMaria, sitting across from him, happily sat next to Kanata.They were close enough to lean their shoulders against each other, and Kanata thought once again that Maria was different from usual today.When he glanced over at her, their eyes met, and she blushed slightly and laughed. It was an oddly itchy feeling for Kanata that he couldn\u2019t stay calm.\u201cIt\u2019s really quiet when it\u2019s just the two of us. I like this time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe placed her head on his shoulder.Each of her movements had an indescribable ticklishness to them, and it was as if she was stimulating him to keep him from staying calm.While spending time like that, they finally arrived at their destination by carriage.\u201c\u2026 This is it?\u201d\u201cYes, this is Spirit Lake.\u201dIn a clearing in the forest, a huge lake in the center greeted Kanata and Maria.It couldn\u2019t be considered as wide as the sea, but it was quite deep, and the bottom couldn\u2019t be seen at all, giving it a creepy feeling that there might be creatures living in the deep sea.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty deep, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cProbably. So don\u2019t jump in, okay?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cFufu \u266a.\u201dKanata puffed out his cheeks, saying he was not a child.However, even though the lake was eerily deep, it had an atmosphere and beauty that brought healing. It truly lived up to its name as the Spirit Lake, apparently not named because of spirits living there, but because it would not be strange even if they did live there.\u201cHere, Kanata-kun, sit here.\u201d\u201cOh, thanks.\u201dHe sat down on the sheet spread out under the shade of a big tree and looked again at the lake spreading out before him.It was a beautiful view that could calm even the most troubled heart.The sound of the trees swaying in the wind and the lake reflecting the sunlight like a mirror\u2026 Everything was absolutely beautiful.\u201cSometimes my older brother and sister come here with me. They haven\u2019t come recently, but I always enjoy this scene when I come here.\u201d\u201cWell, I think this scene is amazing. Seriously, it\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d\u201cDo you like it?\u201d\u201cI love it. Actually, I want to livestream here in this peaceful silence and share this scenery with many people.\u201dThat was Kanata\u2019s true feelings.However, while this place is not well-known to everyone, Kanata realized it was the kind of place not too many people should come and cause a commotion, so he changed his mind about live streaming it.\u201cKanata, I\u2019ll give you a lap pillow. Aren\u2019t you still a little sleepy?\u201d\u201cIs that really okay?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Here you go \u266a.\u201dDespite his hesitation, Kanata gratefully accepted her kindness as Maria patted her lap.He rested his head on her lap, enjoying its softness.Since he was lying on his back, he could see Maria\u2019s ample chest in front of him, which was a breathtaking view.\u201cFeels good?\u201d\u201cAmazing.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t use any other word besides \u2018amazing.\u2019 It was a powerful word that conveyed his true feelings.Kanata lay there for a while, but he still felt a little nervous, so he didn\u2019t feel sleepy at all. Nevertheless, his heart was calm, so he enjoyed Maria\u2019s lap pillow while listening to her humming.\u201cKanata-kun.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cThank you for today. For putting up with my selfishness.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s happy that you invited me here.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dA beautiful girl\u2019s invitation, and being alone with her, it\u2019s kind of like a date.(\u2026 A date. When I think about it again, I\u2019m still nervous.)As he pretended not to notice her blushing cheeks, Maria asked him another question.\u201cRecently, did anything happen between you and Alphana?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been closer to Alphana than before, and when you weren\u2019t feeling well, Alphana took care of you, right, Kanata-kun?\u201d\u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201dShe hadn\u2019t gone into detail, but perhaps Alphana had talked to Maria about it.It wasn\u2019t a big deal if Maria knew, but it was still embarrassing to be pointed out by her best friend.However, why was she bringing this up now\u2026 Kanata waited for her to continue speaking.\u201cI have a feeling, but did Alphana confess to you?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cI knew it. That girl always does whatever she wants.\u201dShe chuckled, but her earlier question had been asked with certainty.Kanata was startled, but before he could calm his racing heart, Maria took the next step.\u201cKanata-kun.\u201d\u201cH-Hey!?\u201dMaria gently held his head and pulled him close to her chest.Feeling the overwhelmingly soft sensation pressing against his cheeks, Kanata couldn\u2019t find the words to say anything.\u201cI came here today because I wanted courage. I wanted to confess my feelings to you in the place where I have the fondest memories. I also wanted to stand in the same place as Alphana.\u201dUpon hearing those words, Kanata opened his eyes wide in surprise.The warmth and elasticity pressing against his face suddenly vanished, and he was met with Maria\u2019s gaze directly in front of him.\u201cI love you, Kanata-kun. Not just as Haishin-sama, but I\u2019ve come to love you more and more as I\u2019ve spent time with you.\u201dThis was the second confession in this world, following the one from the Saint, and this time it was from the Princess.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70: Hey, Are You Watching!?\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Fufu, I said it.\u201dMaria stuck out her tongue and chuckled.Although Kanata couldn\u2019t immediately understand the words just spoken to him, he did when he saw Maria\u2019s smile before him.\u201c\u2026 Maria?\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s no wonder that Kanata would be like this when faced with a sudden confession.It\u2019s similar to what happened with Alphana, but he didn\u2019t seem to accept it so easily.The expressions of the two gazing at each other up close were contrasting, but it was clear that both of them were blushing and shy.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for suddenly confessing. But I couldn\u2019t help but say it. I don\u2019t want to be led by Alphana all the time, and above all, I want you to know my feelings even if you already know them, you know?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is that so?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how it is.\u201dMaria moved away from Kanata.However, her gaze never left him, and in fact, it continued with an even gentler look.\u201cI was such a huge fan of Haishin-sama that I went crazy for him, but after meeting Kanata-kun, the person inside Haishin-sama, I can\u2019t help myself but be attracted to you without doubting it, you see? And after spending time together like this, it\u2019s natural for my feelings to grow stronger for you\u2026 Fufu, after it\u2019s my first time in love.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2026\u201dHow should he answer?It\u2019s a fact that both Maria and Alphana are incredibly beautiful girls, and it\u2019s certain that being with them is fun and makes his heart at ease.Even though he\u2019s thought so many times before about how happy he would be to have girls like them as his girlfriends, he still can\u2019t easily reach out and take their hands.\u201cI\u2019m a princess, and Alphana is a saint. You must be really struggling\u2026 or maybe troubled by this. I\u2019m sorry, I knew that and still told you my feelings.\u201dDespite that, Maria continued to speak.\u201cKanata-kun, you can continue as usual. However, from now on, allow me to advance myself more, as I want to keep supporting you. So, please let\u2019s take care of each other, okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSaying that, Maria faced forward.Then, without saying anything, time passed between them. It was not an awkward time, but a comfortable one, as expected when Maria was next to him.Kanata felt a sense of peace when Alphana was around, and he felt the same with Maria.\u201cHey, Maria.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dThat\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t just stay silent after her words. Kanata met Maria\u2019s gaze again and conveyed his true feelings to her.\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m really happy. I mean, to hear that you and Alphana like me and thinking that if I reach out my hand, I might have a chance.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019m such a coward that I can\u2019t even stretch out my hand. You and Alphana are important friends and also very important to me. I probably\u2026 love you both, and I don\u2019t want to let you go.\u201dThat\u2019s right, Kanata also had feelings for Maria and Alphana. He was originally drawn to them because he thought they were incredibly beautiful, but by spending time with them as Haishin and as himself, they became very important to him.\u201cBeing confessed to by Maria and Alphana\u2026 it would be easier if I could just stretch out my hand honestly, but I can\u2019t help feeling like I\u2019m not good enough.\u201dThe princess and saint should say they don\u2019t mind and would definitely accept Kanata. But, it was also the right decision not to be too straightforward and jump into a relationship without thinking it through.\u201c\u2026 If I could just stretch out this hand, honestly.\u201dKanata reached out his hand into the air. Then, Maria gently took his hand and led it to her chest as if inviting him to embrace her.\u201cNever mind being a princess. I\u2019ve actually thought about doing something extreme, like pushing you down here and taking your first time, you know?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?!\u201dThat was such a shocking, or rather, taboo statement that Princess Maria should never have uttered.However, with that one sentence, Kanata\u2019s worries changed to surprise, and for a moment, his worries were blown away in a good way.\u201cFufu, well, that was half a joke. You see, Kanata-kun, I like this moment as it is now. I\u2019m satisfied with the current situation where I can be by your side and help you, the man I admire.\u201d\u201cYou think so?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to force any changes, and I intend to respect your thoughts, Kanata-kun. But because I\u2019ve expressed my feelings, I want you to allow more skinship than before, okay?\u201dSaying so, Maria once again showed a beautiful smile.After that, he was told not to think too much about it, just like what Alphana had said, and to interact with her as usual.Kanata wondered why both Maria and Alphana, being so charming, put him first and themselves second.(\u2026 Because they love me, right? Hey, Maria and Alphana\u2026 How much easier would it be if I were just troubled by whether my partner is a princess or a saint? )Kanata\u2019s worries were not just about his status.It\u2019s because he cares about the two of them that he has these worries, which is almost the worst way of thinking as a man.Even so, Kanata knew that he would continue to indulge in this luxury of worry as he would eventually have to find an answer.\u201cOh, by the way\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dHowever, since Kanata and Maria both wanted each other to act normally, there is no need to drag things on.Maria said this to Kanata, who had returned to his usual self.\u201cDid you\u2026 kiss Alphana?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata\u2019s heart skipped a beat.Since he had only kissed Alphana once, it was not strange for Kanata to be nervous.Maria seemed to have guessed from Kanata\u2019s expression and brought her face closer, looking regretful.\u201cI want to kiss too\u2026?\u201dWhile saying that, Maria gently placed her hand on Kanata\u2019s cheek and closed the distance between them without stopping.With a cute smooch, Kanata and Maria exchanged a kiss.\u201c\u2026 Maria.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the worst indecisive b*****d. Why don\u2019t you just kill me here?\u201d\u201cKanata-kun!?\u201dKanata was overwhelmed with various emotions. Although the dark part of his heart told him to enjoy himself fully while a beautiful woman confessed her love in front of him, it was also Kanata-like to be unable to do it.To heal Kanata, who had a dead expression due to extreme distress, Maria hugged him tightly with her ample bosom. It is well known that men all around the world find solace in women\u2019s b*****s, and Maria knew that.\u201cAll right, first of all, let\u2019s calm down, Kanata-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Maria.\u201dThanks to how they had leaned against each other for a while, Kanata finally calmed down and returned to his normal self.Seeing the rapidly changing expressions of Kanata, Maria felt something resembling maternal instinct and said that she would do it anytime he wanted.\u201cThank you, Maria.\u201d\u201cNo problem, it\u2019s all good \u266a.\u201dFor now, we can assume that the situation has settled down. They looked at each other, and both smiled without thinking.\u201cI know Haishin-sama\u2019s words are great, but it was Kanata-kun who said them. That\u2019s why Alphana and I were attracted to you, Kanata-kun, not just your words on the surface.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 Haha, I\u2019m really embarrassed.\u201dKanata scratched his head vigorously but then suddenly looked towards the lake.\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201dIn the lake, if Kanata wasn\u2019t mistaken, he saw a naked woman staring fixedly with wide-open eyes.The figure was definitely not human, with a completely blue body and red eyes, but it disappeared in the next moment, and Kanata tilted his head in confusion.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cI felt like there was something in the lake\u2026\u201d\u201cOh? Could it be a spirit?\u201dKanata thought of Undines, famous spirits that live in water, but he couldn\u2019t confirm it since it disappeared.However, some words appeared on the surface of the water.\u2018You should do it here. I wonder why all virgins are like that.\u2019[EDN: Straight to the point. H**l yeah.]\u201c\u2026\u201dNo, there definitely was someone there.A mischievous spirit was observing Kanata and Maria\u2019s exchange from within the water!\u201cIs something wrong\u2026?\u201d\u201cMaria, look only at me!\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to show Maria the word \u2018virgin\u2019 or anything like that, so he used those words to convey that message, but Maria seemed to take it differently.\u201cKanata-kun \u266a.\u201dWith heart symbols in her eyes, Maria stared only at Kanata.From then on, someone kept teasing Kanata by touching him secretly whenever Maria wasn\u2019t looking, and it continued until Kanata and Maria left.And so, Kanata was told of the feelings of two girls.What kind of answer Kanata will give the two of them is still unknown and it may come sooner than not.No one knows yet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: With the two of us as a team, we\u2019re invincible, right?\u201cAlphana, may I come in?\u201d\u201cSure, please do.\u201dOn the night Kanata and Maria went to Spirit Lake, Maria visited Alphana\u2019s room. They had promised to talk about something important during dinner. Of course, the topic was Kanata, and it was also because Maria wanted to talk with Alphana again.\u201cI confessed to Kanata-kun, you know.\u201dWithout any hint of unease, Alphana looked straight into Maria\u2019s eyes as she spoke those honest words.\u201cI guess my behaviour may have been a stimulus for you?\u201d\u201cYes. I couldn\u2019t lose. I also wanted to confess my feelings to Kanata-kun.\u201d\u201cI see. I thought I could keep the lead a little longer, though.\u201dAlphana chuckled, and Maria couldn\u2019t help but smile along.She sat down next to Alphana on the bed, both of them in their nightwear. It was an artistic and beautiful sight to see the Princess and the Saint side by side like this.Surely, Kanata would be satisfied with the sight if he saw it.\u201cHey, Alphana.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to fall in love, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes, it is.\u201d\u201cIt warms your heart and makes you feel so happy.\u201d\u201cI know. It can fill you up, but at the same time, you can become selfishly wanting more.\u201dMaria nodded yes.When she had been interacting with Kanata by the lake, she felt a slight twinge of jealousy and envy upon learning that he had kissed Alphana.Kanata had fulfilled Maria\u2019s wish, and they had shared a kiss. The happiness that came over her at that moment was immeasurable\u2026 and furthermore, she even wished to experience more with Kanata in the future.\u201cEven though I have been educated as a princess since childhood, I was willing to throw it all away just to be with him. Love is scary, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cI feel the same way. Sometimes, I think the title of Saint is a hindrance because it makes Kanata-sama hesitate to further our relationship.\u201dSince Alphana, who has always devoted herself to serving the country as a saint, had said this much, love must truly be terrifying.Although she had intense feelings for Haishin, her interactions with Kanata transformed into a deep love and made her the person she is today. This is true not only for Maria but also for Alphana.Even though it is a heavy burden to bear, they have no intention of troubling Kanata, and they both wish to serve him with all their hearts.\u201cIt was the same for me, but I\u2019m sure Kanata-sama was troubled?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s why I told him not to worry too much and just be himself. Alphana, you probably did the same, right?\u201d\u201cYes, even if we can\u2019t expect things to change right away, I wanted him to know my feelings. That way, we can naturally become closer no matter how much distance separates us.\u201d\u201cFufu, you\u2019re quite the strategist.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201dKnowing each other\u2019s feelings and becoming closer versus getting closer without knowing each other\u2019s feelings can make a big difference. If they like Kanata, there is a reason for them to be intimate, but if he doesn\u2019t know their feelings, it could create unnecessary caution\u2026 The difference is too great.\u201cBut I\u2019m happy,\u201d Alphana continued. \u201cAs your best friend, I feel a sense of destiny that you and I would fall in love with the same man.\u201d\u201cI feel the same way. It\u2019s especially gratifying because it\u2019s you, Alphana,\u201d Maria commented.Although they were rivals in love, they could never think of each other that way because they were best friends. In their current situation, their thoughts were in alignment when it came to Kanata.\u201cHey, Alphana.\u201d\u201cYes, Maria?\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d\u201cUfufu.\u201dThey laughed, shaking their shoulders while looking at each other, imagining what the other was thinking. The first to speak was Maria.\u201cPolygamy is not uncommon in this country. So even if Alphana and I were to become Kanata-ku \u2018s wives, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem, right?\u201dAmong commoners, polygamy is not a realistic option due to financial constraints, but it is not uncommon among the wealthy, like nobles.Kanata earns quite a bit as a Haishin, but even if he didn\u2019t, both Maria and Alphana have substantial personal assets\u2014enough to live their entire lives with just love without worrying about finances.\u201cThere\u2019s no problem, but\u2026 Maria? Regardless of Kanata-sama\u2019s answer, haven\u2019t we already decided to be together?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just our enthusiasm. Alphana wouldn\u2019t want to be with anyone other than Kanata-kun, right? Can you imagine being with any other man?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201d\u201cSee?\u201dSo Maria suggested respecting Kanata\u2019s will and continuing to convey their feelings to him until they can be content with just loving him even if he doesn\u2019t agree to polygamy.Although it should have been Alphana who led the way, Maria\u2019s ability to look ahead and charge forward was her strength.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t long ago that I said I wouldn\u2019t burden Kanata-sama and would just support him from the sidelines\u2026 We\u2019re quite the troublemakers, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cYeah, but we can\u2019t stop this feeling.\u201dThat\u2019s right. Once love has been set in motion, it cannot be stopped.Maria and Alphana may become each other\u2019s biggest obstacles, but their friendship and unity are unbeatable.Will Kanata be able to endure the battles between the two?Well, only time will tell.\u201cWell then, let\u2019s finish this serious talk! Let\u2019s play around a bit since we\u2019re in your room like this!\u201d\u201cHuh? W-wait, Maria!\u201dSaying that, Maria hugged Alphana and fell onto the bed.Alphana, who was smaller than Maria, fit perfectly in her arms.\u201cHey, stop it!\u201dNeither of them had close friends from the position of a princess or a saint. Despite that, they met and became best friends, so it was not unusual for them to interact like this, and they may even trust each other more than family.\u201cAlphana, you still haven\u2019t grown, huh?\u201d\u201cStop it! It\u2019s not good to say things that make others self-conscious!\u201d\u201cKanata-kun said that when he hugged Alphana, you fit perfectly in his arms, and it felt good.\u201dThis was one of the conversations they had at the lake. Alphana, who had a complex about her small stature, blushed at the comment.\u201cThen it\u2019s good that I\u2019m small.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so simple-minded.\u201d\u201cWomen are cute when they\u2019re simple-minded. That\u2019s enough to make a decision.\u201dAlphana beamed proudly as she spoke of her small stature. Her simplicity was so endearing that Maria hugged her even tighter.\u201cYour height may be low, but your chest is so impressive.\u201dAs Maria gently touched her, Alphana sighed and said, \u201cYou too, Maria.\u201dAs they played around like this, they naturally started talking about the past. Despite their upbringing as Princess and Saint, they were surprisingly mischievous and active when they were young.\u201cYou remember, on your 8th birthday, you pushed me into the pond in the castle garden.\u201d\u201cI was young then. It was a youthful indiscretion.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by youthful indiscretion!? Who does that to the birthday party host!? Father and Mother were laughing too! It was abnormal!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you didn\u2019t have the elegance expected of a princess they laughed.\u201d\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s right. I was like that back then.\u201dThey continued to talk and even got excited about Kanata.\u201cOh, it\u2019s about time for Kanata-kun\u2019s stream to start.\u201d\u201cYes, let\u2019s listen to it together.\u201dJust a moment ago, they were love-struck maidens, but now they have become mere followers.\u201cHey, everyone! Let\u2019s get started!!\u201d\u201cKyaaaaa!\u201d\u201cKyaaaaaaa!\u201dIt\u2019s no wonder they were later scolded by their classmate next door to keep it down.And so, these two maidens teamed up.What the result will be and what kind of strange events they will bring to Kanata is unknown, but it\u2019s certain that their days will be lively and noisy.Kanata may need to brace himself for what\u2019s to come.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: Have Confidence In Yourself, Kanata\u201c\u2026 Phew, what a luxurious problem to have,\u201d Kanata murmured while staring blankly on his bed.Although several days had passed since Maria had conveyed her feelings to him, there was naturally a reason why he was troubled like this.\u201cKanata-kun, let\u2019s spend time together?\u201d\u201cKanata-sama, would you like to spend time with me?\u201dAlthough they didn\u2019t call out to him in a way that was too noticeable, they both waited for the right moment to speak up and address Kanata together.Well, in itself, this did not change anything from before, but Kanata was trembling at their sincere expression of affection after they had both conveyed their feelings to him.\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing\u2026 must be terrible.\u201dWhile aware of their feelings, Kanata felt guilty for being so vague about it.In the first place, there was no need for him to hold such feelings, as both of them had told him. Nevertheless, Kanata still hesitated.\u201cI have memories from my past life. However, since I\u2019m already living in this world, I don\u2019t have to worry about it at all.\u201dPrecisely because he had memories from his past life, he was not accustomed to the idea of having multiple wives.[TLN: Dem, Why you liek this Kanata!?][EDN: I mean, we could see it coming from so far away, it would have made me believe Earth\u2019s curvature didn\u2019t exist.]Without a doubt, both Maria and Alphana were wonderful women to Kanata, and he was also attracted to them, as they had helped him in many ways.\u201cHaving Maria and Alphana both\u2026?\u201dKanata decided to take all his troubles out of his head momentarily.He imagined spending his days with both of them as his girlfriends, just enjoying his time with them as he wished, and his body trembled in ecstasy.\u201cJust imagining spending those days with two beautiful girls\u2026 feels sinful.\u201dWhile a real harem was unrealistic, a part of him whispered that it would be fine in this other world.\u201cWell, no, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a harem or anything. It\u2019s normal to choose one person, right\u2026?\u201dHow petty\u2026 precisely because both were so attractive and were Kanata\u2019s type\u2026 because both were so important to Kanata, he couldn\u2019t choose between them.He hated his indecisiveness, but he understood why he was drawn to Maria and Alphana after reflecting on the impact they have had on him and their kindness.\u201cHaah\u2026\u201dFor Kanata, who had just turned seventeen, being pursued by two women is a luxurious dilemma and a significant factor that will affect his future.Oh, troubled youth. Kanata was in such a state now.Afterwards, he couldn\u2019t sit still on his bed and went out into the city as usual to distract himself.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s just wander around for a bit.\u201dHe intended to refresh himself that way.\u201c\u2026 Why are you guys here anyway?\u201dKanata was supposed to be walking alone in the capital city, so why were two people by his side now?\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, Kanata.\u201dGarula, a demon and birdman, and\u2026\u201cI just wanted to see you. I never thought I\u2019d be with this guy.\u201d\u2026 Lucia, a succubus and also a demon.He hadn\u2019t seen Gurura since he went to the Demon Kingdom, and he hadn\u2019t seen Lucia since the Mint and Yua incident.Both seem to hide their demon-specific wings and horns with magic, so they just looked like a large man and a s**y woman.\u201cThis capital city is as lively and peaceful as ever. The Demon Kingdom has always been like this lately. Well, peace is always the best.\u201d\u201cYou say that a lot, even though you\u2019re known as a martial arts enthusiast and a hot-blooded person in the Demon Kingdom.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bring up old things.\u201dGarula and Lucia exchange insults, but Kanata knows they are a good pair.They do not seem to have any romantic feelings for each other, but they treat each other as solid comrades and respect each other as equals at the same time.\u201cWhere\u2019s Shrouza?\u201d\u201cPlaying with the kid at Mint\u2019s place.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cShe likes her very much because she is Kanata\u2019s child.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dStrictly speaking, it\u2019s not as if Yua is Kanata\u2019s child. Of course, everyone understands that. However, it seems Shrouza is quite fond of Yua.Lucia told him that Yua wanted to meet Kanata, and they promised to meet next time.\u201cSo? You seemed troubled about something?\u201d\u201cI was also curious. Would you mind telling us?\u201dIt seemed they had noticed that Kanata was troubled about something.Kanata hesitated a little but decided to ask indirectly.\u201cI was wondering about men who have relationships with multiple women. I feel like it\u2019s the worst and impossible.\u201dWhen Kanata spoke, Garula laughed with interest, and Lucia stared at Kanata with widened eyes.Although confused by their completely different reactions, Kanata suddenly realized it was a weird question and apologized.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize. I understand somewhat,\u201d Garula said, putting his arm around Kanata\u2019s shoulder.The feeling of being embraced by strong arms gave Kanata a sense of security and the feeling of having an older brother. Not only was Garula\u2019s size impressive, but also his reassuring presence.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. When you say a man who has relationships with multiple women, it\u2019s not just a physical relationship but something closer, right? If you think about being able to make multiple women happy, isn\u2019t that a good thing?\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cAt least, that\u2019s what I think. Besides, whether it\u2019s one person, two people, or more if someone directs their feelings towards you, it\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re a good man. Have confidence, Kanata.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not me, though.\u201d\u201cHaha, let\u2019s just say it is.\u201dKanata\u2019s head was vigorously patted, and he told Garula to stop, but he didn\u2019t really push him away.\u201cGarula is like an older brother to me. Well, I\u2019ve never had a sibling, though.\u201d\u201cKanata as my little brother? That means I\u2019m never gonna be bored,\u201d Garula said jokingly.They laughed together.Meanwhile, Lucia, who was left out of the conversation, pouted discontentedly.Although Lucia often spoke bluntly to Garula, she seemed unable to speak up while feeling frustrated that the atmosphere between Kanata and Garula was too good.\u201cIt\u2019s about time, Garula. Let me borrow Kanata-kun,\u201d Lucia said, embracing Kanata tightly.As always, her sweet fragrance and soft resilience were something any woman could have, but as a succubus, she had an irresistible charm that made his head spin.\u201cI\u2019m not going to continue your previous conversation, but Kanata-kun, you should have more confidence in yourself. You certainly captivated many people as Haishin and became a world-renowned figure, but you were Kanata-kun before being Haishin,\u201d she said, gently and lovingly stroking Kanata, unlike Garula earlier.If one were to feel strength in a man, would it be a sense of inclusiveness in a woman?\u201cYou are changing more people than you think. The Demon King, myself, Garula, and everyone else you\u2019ve been involved with, it goes without saying.\u201d\u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why\u2026 It might be even more difficult from now on, Kanata-kun.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dShe didn\u2019t say what that difficulty meant, but Kanata couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of foreboding that something difficult was going to happen.\u201cHey Kanata, how about spending a few days at Lucia\u2019s place to forget about your troubles?\u201d\u201cLucia\u2019s place?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a gathering place for succubi, but in a way, it\u2019ll make you forget about the troubles you\u2019re feeling now.\u201dKanata tilted his head in response to Garula\u2019s words, and Lucia nodded in agreement.\u201cThat\u2019s right. From morning till night, dozens of succubi, including myself, will be by your side. Your lower half never gets thirsty, and it\u2019s always a pleasurable time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 a little scary,\u201d Kanata said, voicing his concern.But what Garula probably meant was that being thrown into a gathering place of succubi and inevitably having relationships with multiple succubi would make Kanata realize that his current troubles were small and easy to throw away. It was a harsh treatment that would drive that idea into Kanata\u2019s mind.\u201cWell, I\u2019m against it too, but ultimately, it\u2019s up to you and how you feel.\u201d\u201cLucia\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cI will not allow any other succubus to touch him, even if we are fans. If anyone were to do it, it should be just me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs expected, succubi were faithful to their desires.After chatting with the two of them for a little while longer, Kanata saw them off as they returned to the Demon Kingdom, and then he returned to his dormitory.Kanata\u2019s troubles were far from over, but their words of encouragement were deeply engraved in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73: Kanata Wants to Respond in His Own WayA few days after meeting Garula and Lucia, the academy began to dedicate time to group mock battles in preparation for the upcoming event.\u201cLightning!!\u201dA high-voltage magic released from Kanata\u2019s hand pierced the noble students\u2019 barrier. Even though they had created their barrier with three people, it did not do anything at all. The noble students were surprised but also showed their anger towards Kanata, a commoner.\u201cHow dare this commoner!! Don\u2019t get too full of yourself!!\u201d\u201cWell, then what do you want me to do? Just stand there and take it?\u201d\u201cShut up!!!\u201dThe noble students shouting like henchmen, rather than villains, activated intermediate-level magic that Kanata had not learned yet. Their magic flew straight towards him, but, of course, it did not hit him.\u201cWe won\u2019t let you do that!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget about us!\u201dTwo students stood in front of Kanata, and a stronger barrier than the previous one appeared. Although the barrier that stopped their magic was slightly damaged, their magic was effectively stopped.\u201cThanks. Thomas and Ron.\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cLeave it to us!\u201dThe noble students smiled at Kanata, and their names were Thomas and Ron. They were the male students who went to the Principality with Kanata, spent time together, warmed up to being friends in the same room, and now they were protecting him.(No wonder Maria chose them. Their personalities are too handsome.)Come to think of it, it was the first time that noble students had helped Kanata like this. With the group mock battles coming up next month, Kanata had no partner to team up with, and it was these two who asked him to join their team. Since then, Kanata had been working together with Thomas and Ron, and they defeated their opponents in a 3 vs 3 mock battle with overwhelming force.\u201cPhew, good work, you two,\u201d complimented Kanata with a smile, and the two laughed in response.\u201cLeave it to us.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve shared the same room before, after all!\u201dKanata chuckled at their words.Although the actual group mock battle would involve fighting with a larger number of people, it was easy to imagine that the battles would become even more intense.If the noble students who had been selected were to face Kanata in the actual battle, they would have to fight side by side, which made Kanata very uneasy.\u201cYou two won\u2019t treat me any differently even if I\u2019m a commoner, right?\u201d\u201cOf course not. We\u2019re all just human beings, whether commoners or nobles. It\u2019s just a matter of the environment we were born in.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. So there\u2019s no reason to think nobles are inherently superior to commoners. However, their lifestyles are likely to be different.\u201dKanata nodded in agreement.The difference in wealth between nobles and commoners was as clear as day, and it was undeniable that commoners would have a much harder time. And if they were a noble\u2019s son, they would likely have a secure future, unlike commoners who would have to struggle.But in the end, it all came down to how each individual utilized their position and how they grew.\u201cI don\u2019t really understand why those guys are so stubborn.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s mostly because of their parents. So, Kanata, we don\u2019t want you to think badly of them even though we\u2019re saying this.\u201d\u201cI know. I don\u2019t really have any hard feelings toward them\u2026 Although, I think they have a different reason for not liking me.\u201dThomas and Ron chuckled at his words.When Kanata looked in the direction that Thomas and Ron were gazing, he saw the girls engaged in a mock battle.\u201cHold the defence! I\u2019m counting on you two!\u201dMaria and Alphana sprang into action.Maria broke through the barrier blocking the numerous attribute magic spells, and charged into enemy territory wielding her sword while manipulating magic to enhance her body.\u201cYaaaahhh!!\u201dMaria showed off her impressive technique of cutting through magic that could deal easily against a magic barrier with ease while giving a battle cry, and Alphana also activated her magic to support Maria.\u201c[Cocytus],\u201d she quietly muttered, a clear sign of intermediate-level ice-element magic that freezes the opponent without any means of resistance.Maria then descended upon the three people trapped in the ice prison and decided the battle by thrusting her sword toward them.\u201cThat was a remarkable display of skill.\u201d\u201c[Cocytus] is an advanced magic, right?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll be learning it next year. The Saint and Princess are really amazing!\u201dAlthough Maria was a princess and Alphana was a saint, they were still students, so there was nothing special about them being selected for the special forces.It was expected they would always get chosen due to their flawless magic skills. Alphana was unbeatable in magic, and Maria was an all-rounder who excelled not only in sword skills but also in magic skills second only to Alphana\u2019s.\u201cOh, they\u2019re coming this way.\u201d\u201cThen we\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah.\u201dIt was natural for the two girls to approach Kanata during their break time, as their duty was over. However, as they got closer, the glares from the noble students earlier became even more intense.As mentioned earlier, the main reason for their hostility was that Kanata was liked by the two girls. But the way Kanata interacted with them was also a reason.\u201cGood job, Kanata-kun.\u201d\u201cGreat work, Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201cAh, thank you. Both of you did great too.\u201dKanata\u2019s cheeks relaxed at the two beautiful smiles.Though their conversation was met with harsh glares from the noble students, it was a familiar sight for Kanata to talk to them like this.\u201cBoth of you were amazing. I started watching you halfway through, and your coordination was impressive.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201dWhen Kanata said that, the two of them looked happy.Like Kanata, they seemed to have decided to watch over the other students or not go anywhere in particular.Maria and Alphana came next to Kanata. Alphana especially kept glancing at Kanata\u2019s hand. Of course, Kanata noticed it too.\u201cShall we hold hands?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes!\u201dKanata tightly grasped Alphana\u2019s hand.Yes, this was how Kanata interacted with them as previously mentioned.\u201c\u2026 Kanata-kun, don\u2019t you think you\u2019ve changed a bit?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Well, maybe my attitude has changed a little.\u201dHe had become more proactive in doing things that would make Maria and Alphana happy.This change was something he originally gained from his conversation with Garula and Lucia. Although it was understandable to put off responding to their feelings, Kanata thought it was not right to disregard their sincere feelings toward him. As a result, Kanata decided to respond to them in some way, even if it was just a formality.(\u2026 I can\u2019t give a clear answer yet, but I\u2019ll find it soon. So please wait a little longer.)As he muttered to himself, Kanata held Alphana\u2019s hand tightly.He was naturally aware of Alphana\u2019s heartfelt joy and Maria\u2019s envy as she watched.Kanata chuckled and put his hand on Maria\u2019s shoulder without saying anything. Maria felt that Kanata had indeed changed, but she was happy with the subtle body contact.\u201c\u2026 Tch.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up with him\u2026\u201d\u201cThis commoner is acting like he\u2019s something special\u2026\u201dAlthough it\u2019s natural to feel jealous when you see someone like Kanata monopolizing two beautiful women, there are different perspectives on it. While it\u2019s different from those who were previously punished by Isla, it would be best if they didn\u2019t go too far and end up getting disciplined again\u2026 but it seems like that might not be the case.Suddenly, something pierced through the ground beneath those who continued to send jealous glares toward Kanata.\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cW-what was that!?\u201dIt was a tool called a \u2018hidden blade,\u2019 typically used for assassination. It may have been a specially made one as it disappeared the moment it caught their attention, but there\u2019s no doubt that had they taken a wrong step and pierced their head, they would have died instantly. It was a tool that left no evidence, and the unknown chill it gave them made their spine shiver afterwards.\u201cI wanted to have lunch with you today too, but unfortunately, I have things to take care of.\u201d\u201cI understand. Then, Kanata-sama and I will enjoy it together \u266a.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Gununu\u2026\u201dSeeing Maria looking frustrated, Kanata chuckled and said they should eat together again tomorrow, to which Maria naturally smiled.\u201cAlphana, can I ask for a lap pillow during lunch break?\u201d\u201cOf course! Please rely on me, Kanata-sama!\u201d\u201cAh, I might as well boycott it. It\u2019s just a part of diplomacy anyway.\u201dThe two immediately interjected, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do that!\u201dIn this way, Kanata also cherishes the two of them in his own way, but surprisingly, he sometimes comes up with an answer to his problems quickly\u2026 but who knows for sure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74: Alphana\u2019s Anger\u201cWell then, Kanata-kun, we want you to do your best as a member too.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Understood.\u201dKanata nodded, although his voice didn\u2019t sound entirely enthusiastic.He was currently in the staff room where teachers gathered, and he had been summoned after the decision was made.\u201cI kind of expected it, but I got selected, huh?\u201dHe got selected for the magic group mock battle against the Imperial Academy.Among the dozens of selected members were Maria and Alphana, but other than them, all were noble students.Normally, Kanata wouldn\u2019t think much about it, but the fact that there was not a single commoner besides him was a source of worry for him.\u201c\u2026\u00a0sigh.\u201dThere was no point in worrying, and he had strong allies. But Kanata didn\u2019t want to accumulate any more hate.\u201cWell, it\u2019s just stupid. I already have a lot to worry about.\u201dKanata laughed, acknowledging that he was starting to become like the protagonist from his previous life who hated standing out.However, as a boy at his age, he didn\u2019t completely lack the desire to stand out, so he tried to remain positive.\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201dUnlike his new friends like Thomas and Ron, Kanata still didn\u2019t have any close friends in his class, so he was met with jealous gazes, mixed with resentment, from both noble and commoner students in the same S-class.(They already know, huh? Well, it\u2019s to be expected if I am called by the teacher at this time.)The nobles being selected were one thing, but because Kanata was chosen over other noble students, he could feel their hatred, as if magic was about to fly towards him if he looked carefully enough.In the current situation where he could hear curses if he listened carefully, Alphana spoke up loudly.\u201cWhy are you looking at us like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026 huh?\u201d\u201cUs?\u201dThey looked puzzled as Alphana pointed it out to them. Though Kanata had also noticed it, he had no intention of saying anything, so he was not surprised when Alphana spoke up.\u201cKanata-sama was chosen for his abilities. The teachers at this academy don\u2019t show favouritism just because they like someone or have connections. They evaluate the students\u2019 abilities carefully before making their judgments.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut then why are we\u2026!\u201dThe noble students seemed to know what was going on but didn\u2019t realize that their way of thinking was fundamentally flawed. Pride that they should be superior to Kanata, a commoner, no matter what could not be shaken off, and so they thought, \u2018Why weren\u2019t we chosen?\u2019\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you guys, huh?\u201dAlphana sighed after muttering. Even the female students around her seemed to distance themselves a little from the cold atmosphere surrounding Alphana.Kanata thought that if someone said anything that would step on a landmine, Alphana would definitely explode, but they didn\u2019t disappoint him.\u201cThis is just ridiculous! Why should commoners be evaluated more highly than us nobles!? They are not chosen like us, but just poor people who will always drag us down\u2014\u201dThat was as far as he could go.\u201cBe quiet.\u201dIt was a quiet voice, but it had the power to freeze everyone in their tracks.(I\u2019ve never seen Alphana like that before.)Kanata saw Alphana show her anger openly for the first time. Until now, Kanata had only seen her gentle smile and cute expressions when competing with Maria. Kanata had never seen her angry before. Alphana\u2019s open anger was probably not only because the nobles\u2019 heartless words were directed at Kanata but also toward all commoners.\u201cIf you have anything more to say that insults the common people, go ahead and say it. I truly despise all of you.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 ah\u2026\u201d\u201cW-what\u2026?\u201dThey were intimidated by Alphana\u2019s overwhelming presence and feared being disliked by the holy maiden, the Saint.The individuals who had just directed hateful glances toward Kanata a moment ago quickly averted their eyes and acted as if they were not involved. However, they were still listening to Alphana\u2019s words.\u201cRegardless of being nobles or commoners, we are all human beings. Yet, I cannot understand how you can say such cruel words based solely on a difference in social status.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThey didn\u2019t seem to have any intention of arguing back.Alphana still had something to say, so she slowly walked toward them.Kanata felt a bit sorry for them as he watched them tremble in fear as she approached, but even he couldn\u2019t stop Alphana now.\u201cI have one question for all of you,\u201d Alphana said as she approached the noble students. Her voice was slightly kinder than before.\u201cHow do you think a country is formed?\u201dThey looked at each other with fear before answering hesitantly,\u201cBecause there is a king who governs the country\u2026 that\u2019s what we think.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think a country can be formed as long as there is land and a king?\u201dAlphana nodded at their answer, but it wasn\u2019t the answer she was looking for.After prefacing that their answer was not entirely wrong, Alphana looked towards Kanata and the other commoner students and continued speaking.\u201cSince there is a king, it\u2019s not entirely incorrect. It\u2019s just a play on words, but I believe a country is made up of the many people who live there. A country cannot exist with only a king or just land; it takes the people living there, holding hands and supporting each other to form a nation. It\u2019s the people who give a country its shape and form, not just the physical aspects of it.\u201dKanata thought that Alphana wanted to emphasize the importance of people living together and supporting each other regardless of social status to create a desirable country.\u201cDo you think that a country can only exist with nobles?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNot everything relies solely on nobles, but they do collect a significant amount of taxes from the commoners. We also eat the crops they work hard to cultivate,\u201d Alphana continued, pointing out that the nobles are supported by the hard work of the commoners.Many students nodded in agreement.\u201cAlthough the nobles may stand above the commoners, that doesn\u2019t mean they can look down on them or insult them. Nobles exist because of the support of the common people, so it\u2019s their responsibility to protect and care for them.\u201dIt\u2019s true that the commoners also work hard to support the lifestyle of the nobles, and while Kanata was happy that there were no tax declarations in this world, he realized that they were still paying taxes in some way.\u201cHowever, it would be difficult to change old entrenched ideas held since long ago. Moreover, even if I were to say more, it would be met with further resentment. Nevertheless, please keep in mind that whether one is a noble or a saint like myself, the reason we have been able to live without the inconvenience is because of the support from the common people.\u201dAfter Alphana finished conveying her message she returned to her seat.Although no one was giving Kanata unpleasant looks in this atmosphere, it goes without saying that Alphana\u2019s words just now were words of hope for the common people.It\u2019s unclear whether or not her words had an impact, but a commoner sitting next to Kanata whispered something softly.\u201cKanata\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cCongratulations on being chosen. Do your best.\u201d\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201dAlthough he was a student who had previously ignored Kanata, perhaps Alphana\u2019s words had made him reflect on something.In principle, adults should be the ones to teach children about these kinds of things, but there are times when words spoken by a saint of the same age can resonate more.This incident was undoubtedly the moment when Alphana\u2019s words were etched into the students\u2019 hearts.It was a small positive turn of events for Kanata, but well. Things don\u2019t always go so smoothly in the world.A few days later, the feared civil war broke out in the Empire.This turn of events made it impossible to hold the group mock battle, and cancellation was even considered. But the words that Kanata spoke as Haishin changed everything.\u201cRather than a civil war or a war, it\u2019s only people who get hurt. So I hope it settles down in a good direction as soon as possible. That way, I can travel to the Empire with peace of mind.\u201dThose words prompted the Emperor to take it seriously, and the civil war was easily brought to an end.It\u2019s strange how the world works.\u201cNow Haishin will come for sure! Ahahaha!\u201dAs expected, this world is just weird.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: To the City of FortunaNo matter how large a country is, it is not a monolith. It was evident by looking at the recent civil war in the Empire, and it was impossible to grasp all the reasons for dissatisfaction that led to such conflicts.Well, this particular conflict in the Empire was orchestrated by those who disliked the current Emperor.\u201cThe current emperor must be ousted, and the nobility\u2019s traditional rule must be restored.\u201dThis is a common story.The current Emperor is strongly influenced by a certain entity, and the policies the entity promoted were being implemented on a large scale, achieving success.Although it wasn\u2019t clear whose influence the Emperor was under, his policies have been accepted by the people and supported by his subordinates as essential for the better governance of the country.\u201cIndeed, I, too, initially thought it was a pipe dream, but I realized that his policies need to be put into practice to be truly effective. Listen, it\u2019s fine to have pride as a noble, but unnecessary pride must be discarded.\u201dThere was certainly something smouldering among those who caused the civil war when their pride as nobles and consciousness of being above commoners was deemed unnecessary.Ultimately, the civil war they caused was quickly suppressed, and almost all of the dissidents smouldering within the Empire were eliminated.\u201c\u2026 Just who is he\u2026 the Haishin who can move that Emperor to action!\u201dAmong those punished with the death penalty, some remain imprisoned. Even among these criminals treated almost like prisoners, it became known that the Emperor suddenly became serious because of Haishin\u2019s words.The name Haishin was well-known within the Empire, but those prideful considered his name taboo and did not listen to his stream willingly.\u201cIt\u2019s all because of him\u2026 that b*****d, Haishin.\u201dWhispering such words, the male ringleader beheaded on the guillotine died with thoughts that no one could understand anymore, let alone Haishin, whose name was muttered as a nuisance.Well, the civil war in the Empire ended too quickly, as mentioned. This event not only highlighted the country\u2019s instability but also showed that, with Haishin\u2019s voice, the Emperor could quickly crush the enemy if needed.\u201cWith this, Haishin can come to our country without worry. If he informs us, we will welcome him grandly! Huh? Why am I working so hard? That\u2019s obvious, you fool! \u2026 I don\u2019t want the Kingdom and the Principality to keep getting preferential treatment!\u201dThe current Emperor who rules over the Empire holds a somewhat special position, but it is no longer something that is particularly concerned about within the Empire.\u201cI\u2019m waiting for you, Haishin\u2026 you\u2019ve captured my interest. I want to meet you soon and have a conversation with you.\u201dThe Emperor wishes to meet Haishin.However, surely Kanata\u2026 Haishin does not want to meet the Emperor. And even if he did meet, he would never reveal his true identity. This is because trouble seems to follow Haishin wherever he goes, and Kanata knows that it is something he definitely does not want.\u201cKufu\u2026 Kufufufufu!!\u201dIt would be better for the Emperor not to know.Probably, no, definitely, he would cry if he found out.*****And so, after the resolution of one of the Empire\u2019s problems, some time passed. Finally, on the day before the long-awaited magic group mock battle, Kanata and the others who were participating arrived in the town of Fortuna, located on the border between the Kingdom and the Empire.It was not held in the Kingdom or the Empire on purpose. It was instead chosen to be in a suburban city located in between.\u201cI\u2019ve never been here before.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while for me. It seems to have changed quite a bit.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t been here in a while either. Oh, that building doesn\u2019t seem to have changed.\u201dFrom early morning, they travelled enjoying the wyvern\u2019s flight. Kanata was almost in a dream-like world.The feeling of swaying softly was pleasant, and the sensation of holding Alphana in his sleep without realizing it was also pleasant.\u201cIn any case\u2026 ufufu \u266a. It was a truly happy moment \u266a.\u201d\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re so unfair, Alphana.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dProbably, what Alphana remembered was what happened until just now, and Maria was jealous of Alphana\u2019s words.To explain briefly what happened, Alphana sat next to Kanata with Maria in front of them, but as mentioned earlier, Kanata unconsciously held Alphana in his arms and slept.\u201cHuh, why am I\u2014\u201d\u201cKanata-sama \u266a.\u201d\u201cMuu!!\u201dHe was holding Alphana close with his right hand and, by some coincidence, gently squeezed her b*****s as he slept. With the two of them cuddling up like that, Maria, who could only stare at them from the front, couldn\u2019t help but be jealous.\u201cRight after you hugged this girl, she immediately made a face, you know? Her nostrils widened so much that it was an amazing face, like something Saint Alphana-sama shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d\u201cI-I wasn\u2019t making such a shameful face!\u201d\u201cI saw it, and it was quite a sight!\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t making it! Besides, wouldn\u2019t you be doing the same if you were in the same position!?\u201d\u201cI would, and do you have a problem with that!?\u201dIt goes without saying that Kanata put his head in his hands, pleading for them to be quiet.Afterwards, the teacher watching the two\u2019s exchange with amusement finally spoke up, and they went to the inn where they were staying.This time, about thirty students came from Kanata\u2019s academy, and they were provided individual rooms. It was a good treatment.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s natural, but it\u2019s a shame there isn\u2019t a single commoner\u2026 In the end, what Alphana said doesn\u2019t concern the other classes.\u201dIn fact, when the two of them sat next to Kanata on the way here, they were troubled by the intense, hateful stares they received.\u201c\u2026\u00a0sigh. Being popular is tough.\u201dSince he\u2019s actually popular, there\u2019s nothing he can do about it.There will be a meeting and dinner with the people from the Empire at the reception hall owned by the mayor who governs Fortuna, but they are free until then.\u201cWell, for now, we\u2019re free\u2026Mira.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMira appeared silently.He understood that Mira usually accompanies him on trips, and it was the same this time.She only follows him with the single-minded intention of protecting him, without the intention of causing trouble for Kanata.\u201cJust to make sure, are you staying in this room?\u201d\u201cYes. If it\u2019s a problem, I can find another place to stay\u2026\u201dAlthough Kanata intends to tell her to do so if necessary, he cannot say it strongly when Mira sounds lonely.\u201cWell, it\u2019s fine for you to stay since we\u2019re free anyways.\u201d\u201cThank you very much!\u201dMira replied with a beaming smile.Having Mira here is reassuring for Kanata, and it is not an exaggeration to say that the safety of Maria and Alphana was guaranteed to some extent, even if they were apart.The teachers were also present, and the security was tight, so there shouldn\u2019t be any unexpected events. But Mira, who has made a legend under the name of Raven, has a significant presence.\u201cKanata-sama, please do your best in the mock battle this time!\u201d\u201cYeah. Well, I\u2019ll do my best in my own way.\u201dRegarding this mock battle, it seems quite a few powerful people from the Empire will be participating this time. Rumour has it that their abilities are on par with or even greater than Maria\u2019s, so Kanata got a little anxious, but he could only think that he\u2019ll manage somehow.As he was considering what to do now that he was free, there was a knock on the door.\u201cKanata-kun, can we come in?\u201dIt was Maria\u2019s voice, but Alphana was probably with her too.\u201cCome on in.\u201dWhen he conveyed that, Maria and Alphana came inside.\u201cOh, Mira-san is here too.\u201d\u201cFufu. She\u2019s Kanata-kun\u2019s bodyguard, after all.\u201d\u201cYes! Of course, but I\u2019ll protect both of you as well!\u201dMaria and Alphana seemed to be comforted by Mira\u2019s radiant smile.Watching their reactions, Kanata muttered to himself.\u201c\u2026 Even though I\u2019m not much better, Maria and Alphana don\u2019t seem to care either.\u201dMira\u2019s response was so natural that Kanata couldn\u2019t help but shudder a little.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76: The Strongest Twins, but in Reality\u2026\u201cHey Kanata, are you having fun?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, it\u2019s Ron.\u201dRon approached Kanata, who was sitting in a corner of the grand hall where a lot of food was laid out on the table.With a quick adjustment of his glasses, Ron looked like a capable man. Kanata chuckled at his appearance and asked if Thomas was not there.Ron nodded.\u201cThomas is over there.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Oh.\u201dThomas was eating a luxurious meal one after another where Ron pointed at with his gaze. Although it was not a quantity that one person could eat, he kept putting it in his mouth one after another like a competitive eater.(He\u2019s going to be a match for Mira\u2026 No, Mira\u2019s stomach is already inhuman, so she\u2019s not an opponent.)That just shows how amazing Mira is.Now, let\u2019s briefly look at the current situation.Kanata and the others arrived in Fortuna, and it was already nighttime. The dinner party with the members of the Empire was currently taking place after they had met each other. They were students who spent their days striving to improve themselves, and tomorrow they would be fighting each other with all their might, even if it was just a mock battle.\u201cDid you make any acquaintances from the Empire?\u201d\u201cTo some extent, yes. What about you, Kanata\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t make me say it.\u201dKanata sighed at Ron\u2019s gaze, which was fixated on him.Despite this being a place of interaction at a banquet, Kanata had not interacted with anyone. He didn\u2019t feel the need to, and above all, he felt out of place.\u201cWell, we probably won\u2019t meet again after this event is over, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019m fine with that.\u201d\u201cWell, not that it concerns me. But you\u2019re usually getting along well with Princess Maria and Saint-sama, so you\u2019re probably having fulfilling days already, huh.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dKanata gave Ron a sharp look, and Ron apologized before walking over to Thomas.Once again alone, Kanata took a piece of bread from a nearby table and took a bite.\u201cWhat toppings are on this meat and vegetable dish? It\u2019s delicious.\u201dAs he savoured a combination he had never tasted before in the capital city, two unfamiliar voices approached him.\u201cI understand your excitement, but I wish you had a little more sense of tension.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. This is like a festival, and we should enjoy it our own way.\u201dThey spoke and stood a little away from Kanata.(Oh, I think these are the\u2026)Kanata had some information about them beforehand. It was said that skilled students from the Imperial Academy would come this time, and the teachers had warned them specifically about the two of them during the mock battles.\u201cAnise, you\u2019re a little too relaxed.\u201d\u201cNo-no. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s being so uptight, Fest.\u201dTheir names were Fest Gravatt and Anise Gravatt, respectively. They are twin children of a well-known noble family in the Empire.Fest had fiery red hair, while Anise had a freezing light blue colour, which, combined with their similar facial features, formed a contrasting beauty.(Fest, who controls flames that burn everything, and Anise, who controls ice that freezes everything\u2026 the strongest twins who\u2019re said to be the future of the Empire, huh?)Kanata sighed at why they brought those people here, but it was certain they would fight them in the mock battles tomorrow since they were here.\u201cThis is going to be a mess.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a mess.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be a mess.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dKanata unintentionally responded to their overlapping words, but it seemed they did the same.The handsome boy and beautiful girl, with similar facial features, looked at Kanata. He bowed his head slightly, and they bowed their heads back to Kanata. It was immediately apparent that Kanata was not accustomed to such a situation, but he thought that perhaps they would taunt him for being a commoner, but there was no need to worry about that.\u201cAre you not enjoying this dinner party?\u201d\u201cHuh? No, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not enjoying it\u2026\u201d\u201cReally? I felt a vibe that you\u2019re uncomfortable here. Hey, let\u2019s just go outside.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dKanata was suddenly taken by the arm of Anise and taken outside.\u201cAh, hey!\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s raining. Let\u2019s freeze it all!\u201dDespite not minding getting wet, she froze all the rain ahead to avoid getting wet.However, Kanata realized that she was not just freezing in the rain.If she had only frozen the rain, the ice should have fallen to the ground, but all the ice remained suspended in the air as if time had stopped.\u201cWhat is happening here?\u201d\u201cHehe, it\u2019s a piece of cake with my power~ \u266a.\u201dAnd this girl was a very high-energy person.She was only slightly shorter than Kanata in height, but the softness of her body was comparable to Maria\u2019s\u2026 in other words, Kanata was feeling the sensation of a woman\u2019s chest for a while.(\u2026 What the heck is happening?)Presumably, Anise had no other intentions based on her behaviour and didn\u2019t seem to be thinking anything.She probably just got curious when she saw a student from another school who seemed bored.\u201cAnise, don\u2019t trouble him too much.\u201d\u201cMmm! You\u2019re too strict, Fest.\u201d\u201cAnise\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Tch.\u201dSo she finally let go of Kanata\u2019s arm.Although he was surprised to be taken outside like this, he didn\u2019t have much to complain about since there was no ill intent.When he saw Fest catching up with them later, he thought he might be that type and struck up a conversation.\u201cAre you the type who has been struggling a lot?\u201d\u201cDo you understand me?\u201d\u201cNot really. But she seems stubborn.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! This one is always causing me trouble like an unruly horse!\u201d\u201cHey, wait a minute! Isn\u2019t that harsh? You shouldn\u2019t say that to a cute girl who hasn\u2019t gotten married yet!\u201dIt seems that Fest is having a hard time with Anise.\u201cOh, sorry for the sudden introduction. I\u2019m Fest Gravatt, and this is Anise Gravatt.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Kanata. Nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you too, Kanata.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you too, Kanata!\u201dAlthough he was brought here without his consent and had to introduce himself, Kanata could not have expected to speak to the famous twins from the Empire first.However, seeing them up close, he could tell they exuded a different aura.Their appearance is impressive, and the quality of the magic they wield somehow feels similar to Maria or Alphana.\u201cKanata, are you a commoner?\u201d\u201cYeah. So I\u2019m a little surprised you guys are treating a commoner like me normally.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 Well, there was discrimination based on social status within the Empire before, but after the end of the civil war, it was thoroughly stopped. So at least for us who pledge allegiance to the current Emperor, there is no need to worry about such things.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dKanata was curious about whether the current Emperor had implemented policies close to the common people. However, Fest suddenly opened his mouth with excitement.\u201cBy the way, Kanata!\u201d\u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201d\u201cI had the opportunity to greet Princess Maria earlier, but there was something I couldn\u2019t ask her. Anise said it would be fine, but it\u2019s still inappropriate to ask in public\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dKanata felt a sense of deja vu in the atmosphere that Fest exuded.\u201cKanata, you\u2019re from the Capital, right? Can you tell me about Haishin-sama? Did Kanata get any goods?\u201d\u201cHey, you\u2019re too close! Too close!\u201dThe handsome man\u2019s demeanour crumbled, revealing himself as simply a fan. It seemed that he, too, was a victim of Haishin poison, and Kanata felt a complex emotion as the fan appeared with joy, but the man\u2019s dignity crumbled.(\u2026 Here too, huh? Well, it seems like it\u2019s becoming famous even in the Empire\u2026 But man, this handsome guy is a mess.)\u201cHey, Fest, now you\u2019re the one causing trouble for Kanata\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ahm. My apologies. We are also Haishin-sama\u2019s fans but we haven\u2019t been able to get any goods. So if you\u2019ve got any, we just wanted to know how it feels to have them.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dOh, right! Kanata remembered something.The Haishin badges were mainly sold in the capital, and the shirts were mostly in the Kingdom and Principality, so they weren\u2019t really circulating in the Empire.\u201cCome to think of it\u2026\u201dHe only had one shirt, but Kanata remembered having two badges attached to his bag.\u201cI only have two badges and one shirt, but\u2026 do you want them?\u201dKanata was naive to offer, but Fest and, above all, Anise reacted greatly.\u201cYou have them!? Will you give them to us!? If you do, let\u2019s work together tomorrow behind the scenes and knock down everyone else except us!!\u201d\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not okay\u2014\u201d\u201cYes. There\u2019s nothing better than Haishin-sama goods. Of course, we\u2019ll give you something in return too, Kanata.\u201d\u201c\u2026 This is not good.\u201dIt was no surprise that nothing good came from getting involved with Haishin.The twins, who had been promised a future in the Empire and had their power recognized, were also a bit too extreme as fans.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77: Streaming the Same Way Over Here!\u201cOh, this is\u2026 this is it!!\u201d\u201c\u2026 I can die now. For real\u2026 Uwaaaaah \u266a.\u201dThe strongest twins were dancing wildly in front of Kanata, who had an indescribable expression on his face.He gave them a badge, one of the Haishin goods, and they both held it up high and shouted with excitement.\u201cYou want the shirt too, right? I\u2019ll give you\u2026 Here.\u201dNeedless to say it was something scary.When he said he would give them a shirt and held it out, it moved at the speed of light and ended up in Anise\u2019s hand.\u201cThank you, Kanata! This is\u2026 what I wanted the most!\u201d\u201cY-yeah.\u201dAnise said so while licking the shirt.It was an action that ruined her beautiful appearance, but it was heartwarming to see Fest cutely rubbing the badge on his cheek next to her.Well. There is a slight feeling of discomfort when a man does that kind of thing, but Anise\u2019s eccentric behaviour was too shocking.\u201c\u2026?\u201dWhile watching the two of them moved, something flickered in the corner of Kanata\u2019s vision.He confirmed that someone was there, but since there was no sense of unease, it was probably Mira.There was no need to be wary of Fest and Anise, but she watched over Kanata wherever he went.\u201c\u2026 Hmm?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dHowever, it was as expected of Fest and Anise.They seemed to have noticed Mira\u2019s presence slightly and looked in that direction, but they couldn\u2019t find her.They probably judged there was no need to be on guard, and soon they were absorbed in the goods again.(\u2026 Well, but it\u2019s not a bad feeling to know that I\u2019m loved like this, or rather, they are fans.)Since he understood their abnormal behaviour was purely because they were his fans, Kanata was quite happy.He asked the two who were residents of the Empire, whom he would never meet under normal circumstances.\u201cBy the way, what do you like about Haishin?\u201dWhen Kanata asked this question, they both turned their faces toward him simultaneously, which made him nervous.First, Fest spoke with an air of nonchalance, leaning in and spitting out his words with force.\u201cI fell in love with the casual policies he proposed and his feelings for the many people they included. Of course, not just me, but many others including the current Emperor sympathized with and were fascinated by him. When we put his words into action and implemented the policies, many slaves and commoners were saved, and at the same time, nobles like us were able to realize the importance of certain things.\u201d\u201cOh, I see\u2026\u201d\u201cThere may be people in this world called heroes and brave warriors. However, only Haishin has brought about visible change like this! I am deeply in love with his heart that values the preciousness of everyday life that everyone desires\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dFest\u2019s words were suffocatingly passionate.(Well, it\u2019s not just me, but I think everyone ultimately wants peace in their daily lives. I was just talking about how we could achieve that.)Of course, Kanata did not have any noble ideas. He simply spoke about what he thought could work to achieve peace. Kanata\u2019s style was mostly small talk, so Fest was overthinking things.Now, Kanata\u2019s gaze turned to Anise, but he quickly averted his eyes.\u201cW-why are you taking off your clothes!?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, sorry. I just wanted to put on the shirt quickly.\u201dAnise had taken off the school uniform she was wearing until a moment ago. Despite being seen in blue, frilly underwear, the same colour as her hair, she didn\u2019t show any signs of embarrassment and quickly put on the Haishin-sama shirt as she said.\u201cHey, Fest, I feel like I\u2019m wrapped up in Haishin-sama\u2026 Ahh, I\u2019m coming \u266a.\u201d[EDN: Why. Just why.]\u201cHey, make sure to let me wear it later too.\u201dAlthough Anise\u2019s words were somewhat shocking, Kanata decided not to worry about it, having seen many strange women in this world.(\u2026 I\u2019ve met many, including the Goddess and such. Compared to them, she\u2019s cute.)Kanata, who had a distant look in his eyes, stared at Anise, who had changed into a shirt.Anise met Kanata\u2019s gaze and began to talk about Haishin like Fest did.\u201cFor me, I just really love Haishin-sama. His voice is amazing, and he seems really kind, too. It\u2019s like\u2026 he\u2019s an idol I can have faith in, you know?\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dKanata\u2019s cheeks loosened a bit as she was drawn in by Haishin\u2019s good voice and kind demeanour, but she took a small step back from the conversation.Kanata tilted his head, wondering if Anise was trying to avoid him, but he soon learned why.\u201cSo, you know\u2026\u201dAnise\u2019s aura shifted slightly.She took off her shirt and once again stood before Kanata in her underwear. Then, she pressed her face against the part of the shirt with Haishin\u2019s face on it.As she rubbed her face against it, she eventually lifted her head and said,\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been a fan of Haishin-sama since he started streaming, so I\u2019m a pretty long-time fan. I\u2019ve donated quite a bit of money to him too, even though I\u2019m like this.\u201d\u201cR-really?\u201d\u201cYeah, really. I\u2019ve been a fan for so long\u2026 I thought I was his number one fan, but why did that princess and saint meet him first? I can\u2019t say it often, but sometimes I feel like I want to crush that beautiful neck of hers, you know?\u201d\u201cOh, this one\u2019s dangerous too,\u201d Kanata took a step back.Anise continued to mutter something, but she seemed to be too absorbed in the shirt she was holding to say anything more.\u201c\u2026 Your sister is quite dangerous, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t really say anything about that, but at least there are a lot of girls like her in the Empire, you know?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s because he\u2019s an unattainable figure that we\u2019re able to hold back\u2026 but then again, for the princess and the saint to meet him like that\u2026 that\u2019s so unfair, you see?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata looked at Anise again.To be honest, he was afraid of her, but he had seen women like her who spoke like this on social media in his past life.Even if Kanata didn\u2019t intend to, it was a common sight of a woman jealous of another who gets to meet the idol-like entity they worship.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to cause any trouble for Haishin-sama. I won\u2019t lay a hand on the two acquainted with him nor will I give them a hard time. I know my limits.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201d\u201cAnise also has a girly side where she fantasizes about dating Haishin-sama. There are cute parts to her, I can tell as her sibling.\u201dIt\u2019s questionable whether fantasizing is girly or not, but Kanata decided not to think too much about it.Afterward, Kanata parted with the two while they thanked him profusely.After the two left, it seemed that someone was still watching them. It was Mira who quickly landed beside him.\u201cGood work, Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yeah, I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d\u201cThose two are quite skilled, huh.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. If I were to face them, my chance of winning would be about sixty percent. If they were to detect me head-on, I would probably cut it to fifty percent.\u201d\u201cI see. But still, you\u2019re so amazing, Mira.\u201d\u201cHehe, I\u2019m your bodyguard, after all, Kanata-sama!\u201d\u201cThanks. But would your winning percentage be lower if you faced the two of them at the same time?\u201d\u201cOh, was it hard to understand? It\u2019s a sixty percent chance against the two at the same time!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata realized once again how high Mira\u2019s potential was and was glad she wasn\u2019t an enemy.\u201cBy the way, Anise has a habit of unleashing her magical power when she listens to Haishin\u2019s voice because she loves him too much. Of course, it may affect those around her, but it has no impact on the human body. In the Empire, it\u2019s like a kind of festival.\u201dHe was curious about what those words meant. Kanata urged Mira to return to the room first and joined Maria and Alphana, who had finished talking with the mayor in the hall.\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\u201cYou weren\u2019t there during the meeting.\u201d\u201cI had a chance to talk to the Gravatt twins.\u201dWhen he mentioned it, the two looked surprised but then relieved they could make good connections as they were trustworthy personality-wise.Fest was one thing, but he kept quiet about Anise, who seemed to be carrying a huge bomb.\u201cWell then, shall we get started?\u201dSince he wasn\u2019t using the usual terminal, today\u2019s stream was as simple as the one in the Principality.While being watched by the excited Mira behind him, Kanata began today\u2019s live streaming.\u201cHey, everyone! Let\u2019s get started with today\u2019s stream!\u201dAs usual, the comment section was bustling, and Kanata spoke while grateful that many people were watching again today.However, in the middle of it, a wave of magical energy visibly rushed through his body.It was a chilly feeling, but it didn\u2019t seem to affect his body, so he stopped speaking for a moment, but it didn\u2019t seem necessary to worry as Mira only tilted her head slightly.\u201cToday\u2019s letters\u2026 huh?\u201dAt that moment, Kanata stopped speaking as he looked outside. It had been training just moments ago, but now, all the raindrops were frozen mid-air and were glittering.(\u2026 Ah, could it be the magical excitement they mentioned earlier?)It seemed this was indeed the result of Anise\u2019s excitement and magical energy. Kanata chuckled wryly, then resumed the livestream.****\u201cOh, hey, Anise! Today\u2019s livestream was amazing\u2026 hmm? Is something wrong?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cThen why are you staring over there like that? That\u2019s where the students from the Kingdom are staying\u2026 Oh? Do you have a crush on someone there besides Haishin-sama?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have feelings for anyone but Haishin-sama, you know that. Don\u2019t ask such obvious questions.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Well, tomorrow is the mock battle. So get some rest, okay?\u201d\u201cYes~.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78: The Start of the Mock Battle, Chaos Erupts AlreadyThe next day, the start of the group magic mock battle drew near.The battle was held in a wasteland away from the town, and the rules stated that the winner would be the team that managed to capture up to three of the opposing team\u2019s bases. If the battle ended due to time running out, the number of bases captured and players remaining would be considered to determine the winner.\u201cI see\u2026 So we have to protect this thing.\u201dKanata murmured as he touched the specialized clothing prepared for the mock battle.The clothing had a feature that determined whether an attack was fatal or not based on the strength of the magic or sword strike that had made contact with it.If the clothing judged the attack fatal, the wearer would get disqualified from continuing the battle.\u201cYes, but it\u2019s a very useful thing. Once this feature is activated, the magic won\u2019t be able to reach us. It\u2019s what the teachers call \u2018perfect preparation.'\u201d\u201cHou~\u201dKanata nodded in agreement with Alphana\u2019s words.If an attack was fatal, it would have a considerable amount of power, and the damage normally inflicted on the body would be quite significant.However, since the clothing would activate a defensive spell to protect the wearer before the magic actually caused any damage, they could feel reassured.\u201cIn other words, our opponents will be using powerful magic without hesitation. In that regard, it\u2019s no different from a real battlefield.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dKanata replied, and the other team members also showed their nervousness but didn\u2019t seem intimidated.\u201cAlright, then. We\u2019ve come this far, so we have to do our best!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Let\u2019s teach those Imperial b******s a lesson!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do this!!\u201d\u201cYeahhhhhhh!!\u201dThey all shouted, and their morale was high. Just then, a spark set off as a signal for the start of the battle.As mentioned earlier, the rules for the mock battle were to either capture or defend the bases.\u201cThen let\u2019s get started. Everyone, please do exactly as I have instructed you.\u201dThe command post was naturally taken by Maria, and there was no one to question it.With Alphana stationed by Maria\u2019s side, the remaining students dispersed and attacked the enemy\u2019s base.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go, Kanata.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dKanata had around ten allies around him, including Thomas, but naturally, Thomas was the only one Kanata could communicate with.Despite the importance of the situation, the other noble students didn\u2019t pay attention to Kanata and instead gave him hostile glances that seemed to get in the way.\u201cIt\u2019s important to cooperate in situations like this\u2026 geez.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m used to it by now. Besides, Maria has told me a lot about it.\u201dExcept for Thomas and Ron, whoever Kanata partnered with, the hostile glances from the nobles were already severe, so Maria had warned him about it.This ended up being counterproductive, and both Maria and Alphana were on the verge of exploding.However, Kanata told them they didn\u2019t have to say anything and that they didn\u2019t have to push any further.\u201cJust having you here with me is reassuring. I\u2019m counting on you, Thomas.\u201d\u201cKanata\u2026 Yeah, leave it to me!\u201dAs they approached the Empire\u2019s base, which was the target of their attack, the two of them smiled at each other.The Empire had also apparently set up a formation of about ten people and seemed to be waiting to counterattack rather than attacking themselves.\u201cWhat a leisurely pace. Let\u2019s go, you guys!\u201d\u201cGot it!\u201d\u201cHey, what are you guys doing!?\u201dOne of the noble students jumped out, and the others followed suit without any coordination or cooperation. Kanata and Thomas were no exception. They couldn\u2019t help but look at them with dumbfounded expressions.Presumably, their goal was to do well and impress not only their teachers but also Maria and Alphana.\u201cHey Kanata, shouldn\u2019t we go too\u2014\u201d\u201cNo, let\u2019s wait and see for a bit.\u201dKanata placed his hand on Thomas\u2019s shoulder, who reluctantly followed along.To be honest, neither Kanata nor the rest of their group had much experience with group battles, and they didn\u2019t really know what to expect on the battlefield.In contrast, the Empire was known as a military state and probably had some knowledge of the battlefield. That\u2019s why Kanata judged they would only get in the way if they acted recklessly.\u201cWait, what?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dHowever, Kanata had known that if he didn\u2019t follow along with their movements until the end, he would surely be complained about, so he had planned to observe the opponent\u2019s actions to a certain extent before acting.It was just then that the opponent\u2019s student suddenly shouted out.\u201cSorry for the suddenness! You, the black-haired boy, you\u2019re Kanata, right!?\u201dThe opponent had used magic to make their voice heard. The noble students had already activated their magic, but the voice was still clear.\u201cBy Kanata, you mean me?\u201d\u201cYeah, you.\u201dKanata didn\u2019t expect to be called out by name in such a place and made a silly joke. Although he didn\u2019t respond specifically, the student looking for Kanata\u2019s location fired a large ice spell toward the sky.\u201cWe are moving to Base A from here! Move quickly!\u201dIt was an unexpected move from the opponent in front of Kanata and the others.It was essentially the same as abandoning the base they were heading towards. Everyone was wondering what they were planning just as a flash of light ran through the sky.\u201c\u2026 Thomas!?\u201d\u201cWhoa!?\u201dThey didn\u2019t know what caused the flash of light, but they knew the opposing student had fled. Kanata felt something and quickly deployed his magical barrier to protect himself and Thomas.\u201cFreezing Ice.\u201dThe moment Kanata heard that voice, his field of vision was filled with a silvery white colour.Unable to resist, he closed his eyes, but it seemed that deploying a barrier was the right answer, as a cold sensation swept through his body.\u201c\u2026!? What is this?\u201d\u201cW-what\u2019s going on!?\u201dWhen Kanata opened his eyes, the surrounding area had transformed into a world of ice.Even the enemy base they were trying to attack was frozen, and all the allied noble students who had gone ahead were trapped in the ice as well.Not only were they immobilized, but the magic that enveloped them in ice was deemed fatal, and the magic cast on their clothing was activated, forcibly removing them from the battlefield.\u201cEight members of the Kingdom\u2019s side have been eliminated.\u201dAs such an announcement was made, a beautiful ice witch descended in front of Kanata and Thomas.\u201cHey there, Kanata \u266a. Oh, wait, something\u2019s still here.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Anise?\u201d\u201cYes \u266a. It\u2019s been a day since we met, huh \u266a.\u201dFluttering her hand, she was Anise, whom he met last night.The ice magic that had just targeted such a wide area was probably the one she had cast, and its power was undoubtedly a blow that easily surpassed advanced magic.As expected of one of the strongest twins, she was a specialist in ice magic.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing, Kanata. I used magic with the intention of leaving only you behind, but I never thought you would protect the whole area \u266a.\u201dDespite her magic being blocked, Anise seemed pleased.As she said, the area around Kanata and Thomas was unaffected by the ice, so it was quite a strange sight.\u201cThat\u2019s one of the Gravatt\u2019s twins, huh\u2026 What a monster.\u201dShe was probably called a monster not just because of the pure strength of her magic but also because of her skillful use of it.It seemed that they would have a confrontation with Anise in this situation, but\u2026 just then, Anise moved.\u201cYou know what?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dAs soon as Anise moved her hand, her voice came from right next to Thomas. And as if ice were growing from the ground, another Anise appeared from there.\u201cAre you Kanata\u2019s friend? But you\u2019re in the way now. Could you leave for a bit?\u201dAn ice blade appeared in Anise\u2019s palm whilst speaking with a light tone, and she stabbed Thomas. He was therefore judged fatal and forced to leave.\u201cAlright, now there are just the two of us, Kanata.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dTo be honest, Kanata didn\u2019t know what Anise was thinking. She went out of her way to tell other students about Kanata and activated large-scale magic to eliminate everyone except him as if she had wanted the two of them to be alone from the beginning.\u201c\u2026?\u201dHowever, Kanata, too, had experiences in this world that came to life in this situation.There was something similar to what he had felt from Maria and Alphana in Anise\u2019s inexplicable behaviour and passionate gaze.\u201cWell, let\u2019s just cover the two of us for now, okay?\u201dAnise snapped her fingers, and a huge ice wall appeared around Kanata and Anise.It seemed communication with the outside world was now impossible, and it was unlikely anyone would see the two of them.As Anise approached step by step, Kanata spoke to her.\u201cDid you realize it by any chance?\u201dAt those words, Anise nodded with a soft smile.***Now at the Kingdom\u2019s main base.The news that eight students from the Kingdom\u2019s side had been eliminated quickly reached Maria\u2019s ears, and it was natural for her to worry if everything was okay.However, Fest appeared as if launching a surprise attack.\u201cWell, as expected of the Princess and the Saint. Your strength lives up to the rumours.\u201d\u201cThe same goes for you. You\u2019re truly the Empire\u2019s promised Flame User.\u201d\u201cYes, if it weren\u2019t for the two of you, we would have easily won.\u201dNo matter how strong the opponent was, the combination of Maria and Alphana was formidable.Although there were a few students left standing with them, they had been relentlessly fending off Fest\u2019s fierce attacks.\u201cLet\u2019s admit that we underestimated this as just a mock battle. You are strong\u2026 No, the students of the Kingdom are a tough bunch, hence\u2014\u201d Fest said, wrapping flames around his sword.Maria and Alphana remained alert and infused their magic power to respond at any moment.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs they faced each other, they unexpectedly received a message that somewhat eased the tension.\u201cAnise Gravatt, from the Empire\u2019s side, has been eliminated.\u201dFest\u2019s eyes widened in surprise upon hearing the news.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79: This is My Trump Card!Kanata let out a sigh as he caught sight of Anise\u2019s smile.\u201cHave you figured it out?\u201d He asked, referring to whether she had recognized him as Haishin.He had asked because Anise appeared to acclimatize to the same aura he sensed from Maria and Alphana, aside from the meaningful glance he had received from Athena.Anise responded cheerfully, \u201cYep, but I only realized it during yesterday\u2019s livestream.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Wait, were you watching?\u201d\u201cNope, but my magic caught you \u266a.\u201dKanata was curious about what she meant by \u2018her magic caught him.\u2019Intrigued by her words, Kanata asked for an explanation. Anise recounted how, during the previous night\u2019s rainfall, droplets had frozen into ice, and a cold sensation had passed through Kanata\u2019s body\u2014apparently the work of Anise\u2019s magic.\u201cI\u2019m not just any ice mage in the Empire,\u201d she boasted. \u201cWithin a certain range and under specific conditions, I can identify any magic someone possesses.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cI use this ability regularly whenever I travel or while within the Empire. But whenever I hear Haishin-sama\u2019s voice, my stomach starts aching, and I end up\u2026 Kufufu \u266a. This time I hit the jackpot!\u201dAnise took a step towards Kanata, almost as if she was stomping on the frozen ground. Her cheeks were visibly flushed, and the intensity of her gaze toward Kanata seemed to burn even hotter than before.To be honest, Kanata felt somewhat overwhelmed by her intense stare, but Anise seemed oblivious and continued to speak.\u201cOf course, my ability to identify magic is useless if the other person doesn\u2019t emit any magic energy. But I knew you would livestream, so I just had to wait for the right moment. What surprised me was that I ended up staring at the inn as you all night, unintentionally\u2026 \u266a.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata remained silent, his emotions overflowing in the presence of this dangerous individual.\u201cHey, Kanata, there\u2019s no escape for you now, you know? Ahaha, I\u2019ve been itching for this moment. Meeting my idol Haishin-sama is great, but I\u2019m even more excited about facing your formidable magic power that can withstand my own\u2026 Ah, it\u2019s simply wonderful. So wonderful \u266a.\u201dAnise snapped her fingers and stood before Kanata, extending her slender arm. She noticed Kanata\u2019s white breath in the chilly air and murmured while concerned.\u201cForget about the mock battle, Kanata. Let\u2019s do something fun together instead, alright? I can\u2019t ignore this urge anymore. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll protect you no matter what and take care of everything. Come on, be by my side \u266a.\u201dAlthough Anise\u2019s words and expression didn\u2019t match, she seemed too caught up in the moment to realize it. Kanata couldn\u2019t just agree with her, however.\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s flattering to hear that from a beautiful girl like you, Anise, but there are people waiting for me to come back, and they trust me.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s true. Even though I\u2019ve been revealed to be Haishin, we\u2019re in the middle of an important event.\u201dKanata had promised Maria and Alphana, who had been worried about him, that he would definitely return. He couldn\u2019t allow himself to say something like \u2018I was getting along with the opponent\u2019 now.\u201cI\u2019d also appreciate it if you didn\u2019t mention to anyone that I\u2019m Haishin.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t even tell Fest. I don\u2019t want to cause you any trouble.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Asking to do something together, meaning to be in a relationship? Isn\u2019t that causing me trouble?\u201d\u201cHuh? Don\u2019t you like doing naughty things, Kanata?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata couldn\u2019t deny it.He screamed inside his head to blow away the worldly desires that came to mind. To distract himself, he unleashed his magic power to the fullest, filling the area around him.As a result, the ice pillars that had surrounded him crumbled easily, and Anise put her hand on her chest, excited.\u201cWow, Kanata\u2019s magic is truly amazing. Just by touching my body, I can feel an uncontrollable desire\u2026 I want to experience it again and again \u266a.\u201dAnise\u2019s words were unsettling, but she seemed to have sensed Kanata\u2019s resolve to fight and was ready for it.(\u2026 My opponent is a young ice magic user, rumoured to be one of the strongest in the Empire. I can only rely on my almost infinite magic power. So, how should I do it?)Despite having nearly unlimited magic power, Kanata lacked experience in combat. His opponent, on the other hand, likely had more knowledge and experience. It was like facing a boss in a game, but Kanata found the challenge thrilling as he searched for the key to victory.\u201cHere I come!\u201d\u201cHuh!?\u201dBut before Kanata could react, Anise had vanished from his sight. He wondered where she had gone, but then a powerful ice pillar streaked past him, making him gasp in awe. When he turned to look, Anise was standing there, holding out her hand.\u201cThe students in the royal capital, including Kanata, don\u2019t have much experience with real combat, but it can\u2019t be helped. With that last attack, the battle would have been over in an instant, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201dAnise probably intended to imply that if she hadn\u2019t held back, the battle would have been over already. Kanata found it amusing.\u201cHah! That\u2019s a great idea. Why don\u2019t you give it your all and test it out?\u201d\u201cSure thing. I\u2019ll defeat you quickly, and then we can chat while watching from the audience seats \u266a.\u201d\u201cIs that so!?\u201dAnise appeared to be a free-spirited girl. Just as Kanata retorted, icicles started flying at him from all directions. It was impossible to avoid them all, but they vanished just before hitting Kanata.\u201c\u2026 Just like earlier, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019m still an amateur in using magic, but I have confidence in my barrier with the unlimited magic power.\u201d\u201cI see. When magic powers collide, the stronger one prevails\u2026 Isn\u2019t having unlimited magic power a form of cheating?\u201d\u201cShut up. We use what we can use!\u201dKanata unleashed a powerful burst of flames from his hand, shouting, \u201c[Fire]!!\u201dAlthough it was one of the first spells he learned, his flames were incredibly potent, melting the towering icicles in their path. However, even this formidable magic proved ineffective against Anise\u2019s ice.\u201cWow, that\u2019s an impressive display of power. It\u2019s almost scary to think this is just beginner\u2019s magic, [Fire]. It\u2019s even stronger than Fest\u2026 But it\u2019s useless against me.\u201dAnise used a blast of cold air to envelop Kanata\u2019s flames, compressing them until they vanished. Unlike a barrier that treated magic power as a solid wall, unlimited magic power couldn\u2019t affect spells already cast.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, neither of us has a clear advantage. Why don\u2019t we just wait until your magic runs out?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what you\u2019d typically assume, right? But unfortunately, I think your body is already starting to show the effects, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThe moment she spoke those words, Kanata realized that his body wasn\u2019t functioning correctly. His hands wouldn\u2019t move properly, and he felt slightly lightheaded and short of breath.\u201cThis is also part of my strategy. Even if you can block my magic, the cold and chill in the air will drain your energy. Try to remain calm\u2026 Oh, but perhaps staying calm will make you feel even colder?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dAnise displayed mastery in wielding powerful area magic and strategic techniques that maximize the potential of ice.\u201c\u2026 But don\u2019t get me wrong, okay? If Kanata says he wants to stop, I\u2019ll stop immediately. Because I don\u2019t want to hurt you intentionally, you know? Come on, give up? If you do, I\u2019ll also surrender, and we can both journey to some location. There, we can seek refuge and warm ourselves up. Without any clothes, that is.\u201d\u201cIn the end, it\u2019s still the same thing!\u201dKanata\u2019s agitation surged, and he could feel his head heating up. However, remaining idle was not a viable option. Waiting for Anise\u2019s magic to exhaust itself seemed unwise.\u201cThings are pretty wild over there at their main camp, with the Princess and Saint fighting strongly. It looks like they\u2019re holding up pretty well against Fest, though it\u2019s probably tough for just him alone, huh? Regardless, it doesn\u2019t affect us much.\u201cIs that all right?\u201d\u201cThis is more important, isn\u2019t it?\u201dIt seemed that Anise really didn\u2019t care. But if she was here, it\u2019s only natural that Fest was the one causing a commotion over there. Kanata tightened his expression, realizing he needed to go back there quickly.\u201c\u2026 Then let\u2019s give it a try?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dIf Kanata only used half-hearted magic, Anise would block it. Therefore, Kanata decided to forcefully pour magic without any attribute, creating an impenetrable barrier.The magic power gathered in Kanata\u2019s palm was not to activate magic but simply gather it.\u201cAh, I see. You\u2019ve figured it out!\u201dAnise cast magic to prevent the activation, but the barrier blocked all of it. Kanata endured the cold and desperately poured in his magic power, directing it toward Anise.\u201c!?\u201dAnise was taken aback by the magic power charging forward, crushing the magic she had cast. Of course, she dodged it, but Kanata\u2019s action did not stop there.Kanata released all of his magic power at once, manipulating the magic power pervading the area to surround Anise.\u201cHey! Isn\u2019t that cheating!? Why can\u2019t I block Kanata\u2019s magic power!?\u201d\u201cI told you! I\u2019ll use whatever I can!\u201dKanata didn\u2019t hesitate to brute force to overwhelm his opponent with magic power. He reached out to Anise, gripping her tightly and enveloping her in the magic power, shattering the ice she had built up for defence.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 somehow okay.\u201dAnise replied as she fell to the ground, avoiding a fatal blow. She still seemed capable of fighting, but her expression was trance-like as she exclaimed with excitement,\u201cAmazing\u2026 You\u2019re amazing, Kanata! How can this be!? I\u2019m falling in love with your strength \u266a.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. But that passionate love call is a bit scary to me.\u201dKanata said, but he was eager to take this base and return to their main camp, where Maria and the others were waiting for them. He decided to use Anise\u2019s admiration to his advantage.\u201cCan you put this on your ear for a moment?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dShe tilted her head as Kanata put an earphone on her ear and made her listen to something.\u201cAnise~\u201d[EDN: K.O.]\u201c!?\u201dKanata started reciting some cringe-worthy lines, causing Anise to blush and tremble before falling to the ground, covering her chest with her hand and spouting blood from her nose.\u201cI-I lost,\u201d Anise\u2019s arm fell to the ground, and since it seemed to have been judged as a withdrawal, her withdrawal was announced.\u201cAnise Gravatt from the Empire\u2019s side has been eliminated.\u201dKanata gazed at Anise\u2019s location for a moment before nodding in satisfaction.\u201cWell, I did say to use whatever I can.\u201dWith Anise defeated, Kanata swiftly made his way back to Maria and the rest of his team.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80: Where Does Kanata Stand?The mock battle between students from the Kingdom and the Empire had ended safely after the surprise attack from Fest.Fest\u2019s rampage was impressive, but he couldn\u2019t push through Maria and Alphana\u2019s cooperation, and Kanata\u2019s solo capture of Base C was the most significant achievement.\u201cI never thought Anise would lose. Kanata, you are strong.\u201dFest praised Kanata after the mock battle ended, and the students from both schools exchanged words of congratulation.Although Kanata had indeed fought against Anise, there was a difficult issue with explaining the part about dealing a fatal blow. However, Anise had explained it well.\u201cI was completely overwhelmed by him \u266a. Not just my body, but my heart was also in his grip. Even now, Kanata\u2019s voice keeps echoing in my head \u266a.\u201dFrom others\u2019 perspectives, it might be hard to understand what Anise was talking about. But Maria and Alphana seemed to have understood to some extent and even comforted Kanata for the hard time he had.However, this mock battle brought a change in Kanata\u2019s position in a way. Even the Empire didn\u2019t expect Anise\u2019s loss, and it was an unbelievable achievement for the Kingdom, excluding Maria and Alphana.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dKanata had finished the mock battle and was now at the second-day banquet. He had moved to the corner of the hall and received envious and incredulous looks from noble students.\u201cI\u2019m surprised too. I never thought things would go so well.\u201dAnise would have very likely won if he hadn\u2019t taken the risk of using infinite magic power.But it was precisely because he strongly thought about Maria and Alphana, who were waiting for him, that he could find that breakthrough.\u201cWonderful! As expected of young people who will carry the future!!\u201dThe mayor who hosted the event in Fortuna spoke with excitement.It wasn\u2019t just Kanata and the others competing. Teachers, the mayor, and related parties had all been watching the battle to some extent.However, thanks to the countless giant ice pillars created by Anise, it was impossible to see Kanata\u2019s movements clearly.\u201cKanata~?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah, I\u2019m tired.\u201dYes, Kanata was really tired and exhaled. He slowly drank the juice in his cup to calm himself down.\u201cKanata~? Kanata \u266a.\u201d\u201c\u2026 huh?\u201dAmidst all this, Kanata seemed oblivious to the presence of someone nearby due to his intense concentration.When he looked towards the voice with the cup on his lips, Anise was standing there with a smile, seemingly appearing out of nowhere.Unlike yesterday\u2019s school uniform, she wore a black dress that made her hair colour stand out.She casually shook her long blue hair, but now it was tied up in one place.\u201cAnise\u2026?\u201d\u201cYep \u266a.\u201dWhen he called her name, she nodded happily.Her b*****s, which could be said to specialize in showing off, swayed loosely, and Kanata inadvertently looked at it before quickly averting his gaze.Although his gaze was probably clear to Anise, she didn\u2019t seem to dislike it and approached him even closer.\u201cUm\u2026 Close, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cWe are close, right? But didn\u2019t I tell you? I can\u2019t be away from you anymore \u266a.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh\u2026\u201dHer way of speaking was elongated and different from Mint\u2019s, but unlike the laid-back Mint, Anise spoke quite confidently.Her demeanour was somewhat reminiscent of a gal from Kanata\u2019s past life. It was a fresh sensation in this world.(She looks like a gal and is kind of erotic. No, just so erotic.)Anise\u2019s hot gaze directed at him clearly showed the colour of lust, not just in her clothing but in her eyes. If they both went to a room together, he would surely get devoured in no time.However, Kanata wasn\u2019t trembling with fear, perhaps because he was used to being around beautiful girls or because of his experience with Kanna.\u201cI\u2019m still kind of dreaming\u2026 Is it really true?\u201d\u201cYeah. Just as you thought.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 That\u2019s really great. I might be the happiest I\u2019ve ever been.\u201dShe probably had no intention of teasing or mocking Kanata with her words or actions. Her ice attribute was the opposite of her passionate approach toward Kanata.\u201cJust so you know, I have no intention of telling Fest or the Emperor. I don\u2019t think Kanata wants that either, and the reason you\u2019re not revealing your name or face is precisely for that reason, right?\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019re right. Thanks, Anise.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s why I feel superior \u266a.\u201dHe thought it might be more dangerous if Anise knew about it rather than if anyone else in the Empire did.Fest had also indirectly said something like Anise would never cause trouble for Haishin. So, Kanata decided to believe them.\u201cThere you are, Anise.\u201d\u201cFest? What\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cYo.\u201dFess came in, dressed as nicely as Anise.He looked from Kanata to Anise and let out a somewhat tired sigh as he continued his words.\u201cSorry, Kanata. Anise seems to have taken a liking to you.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026 Seems like it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just liking, you know? I want to marry Kanata.\u201d\u201cIf Kanata agrees, then it\u2019s fine, right? I\u2019ll take over the family business. You can leave the family matters to me. Our parents won\u2019t complain about a commoner as their spouse either.\u201d\u201cHey, wait a minute. Why are you just assuming things?\u201dIt was a conversation that flowed so smoothly that it was hard to tell how serious they were. Anise was somewhat natural, and Fest may have had a bit of that as well, making things a bit troublesome for him.\u201cWell, forget about that. What really happened? The teacher who examined Anise was quite surprised. You were smiling while your nose was bleeding, and your body was even convulsing, but there was nothing particularly abnormal\u2026 I can\u2019t help but be curious.\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s just say we had a very intense time. And it\u2019s a secret from Fest.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dKanata sighed, hoping Anise wouldn\u2019t say anything that would cause any misunderstandings.Afterwards, Maria and Alphana also joined Kanata, and they had a different conversation from yesterday with the same group.\u201cBoth of you, it was fun today.\u201d\u201cLikewise. As expected of the Flame Twin, it was a great experience.\u201d\u201cMe too. It was all thanks to Maria being by my side, but your strength is not to be underestimated.\u201dMaria and Alphana exchanged words with smiles on their faces. However, the atmosphere changed slightly when Anise joined them.\u201cHello there \u266a. Before I could go up against you two, Kanata got the better of me today. But next time, I\u2019d love to face you head-on \u266a.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026 Fufu, but I believe we can get along well with you.\u201d\u201cFufu, that\u2019s right. Looks like we\u2019ve got another one \u266a.\u201dKanata and Fest then watched the three girls getting along well after they found common ground. It was a heartwarming sight that showed how even those of high status could still enjoy a common topic and have fun, just like anyone else.\u201cI also want to fight with Kanata next time.\u201d\u201cPlease stop. I don\u2019t really like fighting that much.\u201d\u201cIs that so? But still, you defeated Anise. I\u2019m not going to underestimate you.\u201dRegarding the strange increase in evaluation, Kanata sighed once again.\u201cAt any rate, if you have free time, please come visit the Empire. I\u2019ll have the entire Gravatt family greet you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Are you serious? We just met yesterday, didn\u2019t we?\u201dAs Kanata spoke, Fest laughed in agreement.\u201cAnise isn\u2019t shy around people\u2026 It\u2019s not that. But because of the power she holds and the reputation of the Gravatt family, she has seen many different kinds of people. That\u2019s why her judgment of people is very high. That\u2019s why she hasn\u2019t really taken a liking to anyone\u2026 So if she likes someone, then I also like that person.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how it is.\u201dThey smiled at each other and shook hands.For Kanata, Fest was also easy to talk to, and he felt a similar sense of familiarity to with Cid, whom he had met in the Principality.In this way, through this incident, Kanata made acquaintances he could rely on among the members of the Empire.Later when Kanata and the others were about to return to the Kingdom\u2026 Anise conveyed some meaningful words to Kanata.\u201cWell then, see you soon \u266a.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dWhat does this mean\u2026?And so, despite various encounters, the group magic mock battle came to an ending.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81: Everyone Gathered Together (Vol 3 END)The group magic mock battle had ended without incident, and Kanata\u2019s days had returned to normal.Although he had spent some time on the expedition for a few days, there was no change in his daily life except for the time spent on the mock battle.\u201c\u2026\u00a0sigh.\u201cAfter school, as usual, Kanata had been invited by Alphana to the church and was relaxing there.He drank the nutritional drink prepared by the veteran sister and took a breath.Then, he glanced at the women gathered around the table in the center of the room.\u201cAlphana, regarding the Haishin-sama shirts, I plan to prepare a system to sell them in the Demon Kingdom before the next production run.\u201d\u201cUnderstood. And how many do you plan to produce\u2026 About this much?\u201d\u201cYes. If we have that much, it should last half a day.\u201d\u201cWhat about the badges and the new idea based on Haishin-sama\u2019s mini-characters.\u201d\u201cFor that, please talk to the women in the brothel where I work. They are willing to cooperate with us wholeheartedly.\u201dThe women from the support group were discussing how to develop the Haishin-sama goods in the future.Princess Maria, Saint Alphana, Demon King Shrouza, Courtesan Kanna, and even Athena from far away were all cooperating in various ways.\u201c\u2026 They\u2019re a really diverse group.\u201dEven though Shrouza being the Demon King was a secret, it was surreal to see humans and demons who were originally in conflict exchanging opinions about Haishin\u2019s goods development.It was definitely a peaceful sight where they were cooperating rather than fighting. In a sense, they were becoming a bridge between different races.\u201cThey\u2019re really an amazing group of people.\u201d\u201cYeah, they are.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s a strange sight. It\u2019s unusual to see that person being so friendly with humans like this.\u201dMira, the assassin, and Lucia, the succubus, stood by Kanata\u2019s side. Anyone who doesn\u2019t know them would be very curious about this gathering.Even without accounting that Shrouza and Lucia are demons, the women gathered here are all beauties that anyone would want to have by their side\u2014it could be considered a dream-like scene for Kanata.\u201cSpeaking of Lucia-san\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI noticed earlier that you were talking with Kanna-san as if you were old friends. Do you know each other?\u201d\u201cAh, I was curious about that too.\u201dIt was a little while ago, but despite meeting for the first time, Kanna and Lucia seemed to hit it off, exchanging smiles and enjoying their conversation as if they were old friends.Kanata was curious about the atmosphere that made them seem like longtime acquaintances.\u201cOh, that. Of course, we\u2019re not acquaintances, and today was the first time I met Kanna.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dIn that case, what brought the two of them together like that?Lucia smirked meaningfully and continued speaking, exuding the unique sensuality of a succubus.\u201cWell, we\u2019re both good at manipulating men. That\u2019s where we hit it off.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ohh.\u201d\u201cSince Kanna is a courtesan and I\u2019m a succubus\u2026 you see?\u201dEven though Kanna and Lucia were of different species, they were both professionals at manipulating men. While Lucia had the strength of a succubus, described as the embodiment of sensuality, Kanna had a thorough understanding of how to handle men. If those two met, it would not be strange if a conversation would flow smoothly between them.\u201cKanata-kun, can I talk to you for a moment?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dLucia said so and hugged Kanata\u2019s shoulder.With her dress-like outfit still as revealing as ever, Kanata couldn\u2019t help but feel excited when she got close to him.Perhaps Lucia understood that as she pushed her impressive body against Kanata\u2019s at a level that wouldn\u2019t be too bothersome for him.\u201cI sensed your strong smell from Kanna.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ou.\u201d\u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything, but there\u2019s no way I, a succubus, wouldn\u2019t notice that smell. It doesn\u2019t seem like you actually went all the way, though\u2026\u201dLucia said, making a circle with her thumb and index finger and moving it before her mouth as she spoke to Kanata.[TLN: Ohh!!! They really did it! Dem, Kanata was hiding things from us.]\u201cAfter that, just this remains\u2026 right?\u201dShe pointed to her cleavage and showed the action of spreading flesh with her fingers and entering inside.Kanata couldn\u2019t help but blush and look down as Lucia\u2019s actions made it clear that she knew about Kanata and Kanna\u2019s secret affair.\u201cAs expected. I\u2019m so jealous.\u201d\u201cWell. I mean, I was also swept away by the moment.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a man, so it\u2019s only natural, but if that\u2019s all it takes, I wouldn\u2019t mind being your partner.\u201dLucia then squeezed her body even closer.Kanata was definitely aware of Lucia\u2019s voluptuous body, but he was more worried about what would happen next.For some reason, Shrouza was standing behind Lucia with her arms crossed.\u201cWhat in the world are you doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201dShrouza grabbed Lucia\u2019s head like an iron claw and lifted her up as if she was going to crush an apple.Although it made a creaking sound as if she was going to crush her head, Lucia was a demon, after all, so her head didn\u2019t get crushed.\u201cIt hurts! It hurts!!\u201d\u201cThis lewd demon!! You\u2019re never off guard!!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a succubus, after all!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll crush you for real if you don\u2019t get serious!!\u201dThere was no room for discussion at this point. Eventually, Shrouza and Lucia had a heated argument while the female group and Kanata watched.They were able to discuss the sales and deployment of Haishin goods, so in the demon world, Shrouza, Lucia, and Garula would take charge and also act as vendors.After the discussion, the group dispersed.\u201cWell then, Kanata-sama, I\u2019ll excuse myself first!\u201d\u201cSure thing. Take care on your way back~\u201dKanna, Shrouza, and Lucia left first, and Mira turned her back and walked away as well.Kanata stayed behind to escort Maria and Alphana back to the dormitory, and they left the church together.\u201cBy the way, Kanata-sama? It seems like you\u2019ve earned the respect of many people.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I had been thinking about how to deal with those who like to pick on Kanata-kun, but maybe it\u2019s better this way after all.\u201d\u201cWell, yeah. It\u2019s strange that I\u2019m getting so much attention, but at least it\u2019s good that I\u2019m not being harassed.\u201dAs they walked down the path to the dormitory, Kanata and the girls discussed recent events at the academy. Since the end of the mock battle, rumours had spread about Kanata single-handedly defeating Anise of the Gravatt family.Thomas, Ron, and some of the commoner students praised Kanata for his achievement. On the other hand, the noble students looked at him with disbelief, but the teachers had apparently discussed the matter in each class, and there had been no confrontations with Kanata.\u201cWell, if this means we can have some peace and quiet, that would be great.\u201dWhile it was inevitable that his life as a Haishin would become noisier, Kanata hoped that at least his school life could remain calm.\u201cWell, there\u2019s no doubt you\u2019ll continue to draw attention.\u201d\u201cBut we\u2019ll always be by your side.\u201dThey both took hold of Kanata\u2019s hands as they spoke.Kanata felt their warmth and thanked them for their presence, holding their hands until they reached the girls\u2019 dormitory.With the end of the mock battle, the latest major event had concluded. As Maria and Alphana had mentioned, Kanata would now receive some attention, but he felt confident that he wouldn\u2019t be bothered unnecessarily.\u201cAh. Everyone.\u201dHowever, reality was apparently not so sweet.It was a few days later, and Kanata was excited that the things he had asked for from Cid would soon arrive. A tired-looking teacher appeared.\u201c\u2026 What\u2019s going on?\u201dThe teacher came into the classroom, but the door had been open the whole time as if subtly indicating that someone else was still to come in.\u201cI would like to introduce a foreign exchange student from the Empire. It\u2019s sudden\u2026 And I\u2019m surprised too.\u201dWhen he heard \u2018foreign exchange student from the Empire,\u2019 a feeling of unease grew in Kanata.As if to confirm Kanata\u2019s intuition, a beautiful girl with blue hair wearing the academy\u2019s designated uniform appeared.\u201cHello~ I\u2019m Anise Gravatt. Nice to meet you, everyone~ \u266a\u201dAnise exuded a cool yet seductive charm, glancing around before finding Kanata and smiling at him.\u201c\u2026 You gotta be kidding me?\u201dKanata\u2019s school life was destined to become even more noisy for some reason.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82: What About Offline Events?\u201c\u2026 Hey, Alphana.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dKanata called out to Alphana, who sat next to him with a tired expression.They were currently in the middle of a magic practice class, and Kanata\u2019s gaze focused on a girl about to cast a spell.\u201cFreeze.\u201dThe girl, Anise, muttered quietly as she extended her hand, releasing something resembling a cold wave.It spread as if freezing even the air itself, chilling not only the target but everything around it.As many students gasped in awe at Anise\u2019s magic, Kanata continued speaking, impressed.\u201cDid you know that Anise was coming to study here?\u201d\u201cNo? Maria and I didn\u2019t know either. We were quite surprised.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dIt seemed Alphana and Maria were also unaware of Anise\u2019s study-abroad plans.The reasons behind her decision were unclear\u2026 Well. Kanata had a pretty good idea why.\u201cAnise is just like us, after all.\u201d\u201cAlphana\u2026\u201d\u201cThere, there, it\u2019s okay.\u201dWhen Alphana mentioned \u2018us,\u2019 there was only one meaning behind those words.Of course, Kanata had already understood that from her words and actions. However, he hadn\u2019t given it much thought since he didn\u2019t expect to interact with her, living in the Imperial residence and all.While Kanata was still in the midst of his own worries, Anise\u2019s study abroad had a significant impact on him, as it gradually brought the two of them closer in their hearts.\u201cOh, she\u2019s looking over here. Let\u2019s show her.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t it feel a bit chilly? Are you okay?\u201dKanata and Alphana had already finished their practical exercises, and other students were still in the midst of theirs, so their attention wasn\u2019t on them at all.However, apart from Alphana\u2019s comforting warmth, Kanata didn\u2019t want to think about this cold air that, while not piercing, still pricked at his skin.\u201cHey, what are you two cuddling for?\u201dUpon hearing that voice, Kanata sighed, knowing who it was.As he turned his gaze away from Alphana to the source of the voice, he saw Anise, wearing the designated school uniform, staring at them with her arms crossed.\u201cWell, Anise-san, is everything okay with your practical exercises?\u201d\u201cI got told to stop because the temperature was dropping too much. I knew that, but I wonder if the teachers are struggling to handle me?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s to be expected.\u201dBeing a noble of the Empire and famous as one of the Gravatt twins, the teachers must be troubled about how to handle her.Anise laughed at Kanata\u2019s words and, along with Alphana, took a seat on his other side.\u201cWell, it\u2019s fine even if it takes a long time. I just want you to accept me slowly. I just want to be by Kanata\u2019s side.\u201d\u201c\u2026 So, that\u2019s what it was about?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dYes, she was another girl who had fallen in love with Kanata through Haishin.Their meeting was incredibly coincidental and sudden, but Anise seemed completely captivated by their brief exchanges and the tremendous power of magic he possessed. Lastly, when he showed her his resourcefulness in a critical moment, it was a complete turnaround that enchanted her completely.\u201c\u2026 However, I understand the burden you carry, Kanata-sama. Even though I said I wouldn\u2019t cause you any trouble at first, I truly am causing you distress like this.\u201d\u201cOh, is that how it feels? Despite doing something as grand as streaming, you\u2019re worried about such small things?\u201d\u201cSmall things\u2026 are they?\u201dIt seemed for Anise, they were indeed very trivial matters.However, Kanata had recently started thinking about various things, influenced by his memories of his past life or rather, his preconceived notions.(This world is different from the previous one. So maybe it\u2019s better not to overthink things too much.)There were clear differences between his previous world and the current one.First of all, magic, an unscientific concept, actually existed. There were even individuals called heroes and demons, depending on the location.It was the fantasy world he had once admired\u2026 Well, Kanata was the one who merged it with the culture of streaming, but nevertheless, this was undoubtedly a different world from his previous life.\u201c\u2026 Phew.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cOh? Have you sorted out your feelings a bit?\u201dKanata nodded in agreement.Anise, who laughed with amusement aside, wondered about Alphana, who blushed and gazed at him intently. What was going on with her?\u201cWell\u2026 It\u2019s that\u2026 I mean, your expression just now. It looked so composed and dignified, and it made my heart skip a beat\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve been thinking the same thing. You\u2019re head over heels, aren\u2019t you?\u201dAlphana nodded in response to Anise\u2019s question.The three of them continued to have a relaxed conversation until the end of the class. As they were about to part ways, Anise uttered something like this.\u201cWell, I\u2019ve said a lot, but I also want to be a part of Kanata\u2019s daily life. Of course, I intend to appeal to you as a woman in various ways, alright?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yeah.\u201d\u201cKufufu \u266a.\u201dAnd so, a girl named Anise became a part of Kanata\u2019s daily life.During lunchtime, various discussions were held including Maria, and without any doubt, Anise joined the group that supported Haishin-sama.Anise had a free-spirited and desire-driven side but was also conscientious and abided by promises.\u201cHey, hey, how about expanding this in the Empire too? We can secure support from my family, and there\u2019s so much we can do.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. Let\u2019s consider expanding in the Empire as well\u2026\u201d\u201cIn that case, what about this? If we utilize this route\u2026\u201dNaturally, with Anise joining, there were prospects for merchandise sales previously unattainable in the Empire.According to Anise, there was still some resentment among the older generation towards Haishin, but it is said the Emperor would silence them soon, so there was no need to worry.\u201cAh, that was so much fun \u266a.\u201dAt the end of such a day, Anise wore a beautiful smile and exclaimed.Considering the changes in her environment and being surrounded by completely different classmates, it must have been challenging for her, yet her smile showed she was fulfilling herself to the point where those challenges were not noticeable.\u201cYou were truly lively from start to finish, huh?\u201d\u201cFufu, but I also had fun watching you all.\u201dKanata thought the same.He could sense a gal-like vibe in Anise\u2019s words and actions, which he associated with his previous life, but her vibrant personality was so refreshing that it felt right.Anise could easily make Kanata and the others laugh with her antics, despite only being her first day at the school. She had already become accustomed to being part of their group.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be fun, you know? Kanata is here, and Maria and Alphana are also really nice people. In the Empire, everyone keeps their distance because of my family background, you see.\u201dIt seemed that Anise had her own circumstances as well.However, looking at Maria and Alphana, who supported him, and now Anise, who joined them, Kanata couldn\u2019t help but think that he was also supported by many listeners.\u201cI kind of\u2026 want to do an event where I can properly thank the listeners as Haishin, not just the usual thanks I say during streams.\u201dKanata thought, envisioning an event where he could express his gratitude directly to the audience.\u201cAn event? Hmm\u2026\u201dWhile Maria pondered, Kanata murmured the following.\u201cLike a handshake event, or maybe having a few seconds to talk with each person.\u201dIt referred to real-life events that famous streamers in his previous life used to hold. For Kanata, it was just a casual remark, thinking that it didn\u2019t necessarily have to become a reality. However, the girls reacted sensitively to his murmuring.\u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea. Of course, if it\u2019s okay with Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201cI like the idea. Just having the opportunity to meet Haishin-sama in person at a handshake event would make the listeners happy, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, you don\u2019t have to take it too seriously, okay?\u201dKanata panicked as they started to seriously think about it. It was especially Anise who fell silent as if lost in thought.\u201c\u2026 In that case\u2026 Hmm, I do it? Yeah? Alright!\u201d\u201cAnise?\u201dAnise clapped her hands and started talking.\u201cOf course, it depends on whether Kanata wants to do it or not, but if we\u2019re going to have an event like that, where we can actually meet in person, we\u2019ll need quite a bit of security and preparations for any unforeseen circumstances, right?\u201dKanata and the others nodded.\u201cIn that case, how about doing it in the Empire? I think if we ask the Emperor, he\u2019ll immediately agree, and his close aides are already fans, so there shouldn\u2019t be any issues!\u201d\u201cIn the Empire?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dKanata and the others pondered Anise\u2019s suggestion.While they heard some unsettling words, it was clear that Kanata\u2019s murmuring was about to materialize in an unexpected way.However, no matter what she said, dealing with the Emperor made it hard to believe that permission would be granted so easily.\u201cIt\u2019ll be absolutely fine. If we don\u2019t get permission, he must be an imposter.\u201d\u201cIs that certain!?\u201dKanata\u2019s stomach felt a bit uneasy, wondering how it would turn out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83: Finally, It Has Come To This\u201cI can\u2019t accept this!\u201d\u201cNow, now\u2026\u201dMaria muttered in front of Kanata.It was already after school, and Kanata and the others were free, but Alphana had to leave early for the final preparations for the Harvest Festival. Anise, who was currently a hot topic, tried to join Kanata and the others, but she ended up being surrounded by classmates.\u201cWait, Kanata!\u201dKanata steeled himself against the calling voice.Being surrounded by many classmates and bombarded with questions was also the duty of an exchange student.And so, while he was alone outside, he ran into Maria, and that\u2019s why they were walking together like this.\u201cAs for Alphana\u2026 Well, let\u2019s forget about her. But Anise is an SSS class! So why is she placed in the S class!?\u201dThe reason for Maria\u2019s dissatisfaction had been apparent for some time.The class placement system was based on the measurement of potential magical power, something explained multiple times.According to that system, Anise\u2019s magical power should have placed her in the SSS class, but for some reason, she was in the same class as Kanata and Alphana.(She probably forced her way in\u2026 Was I the cause of that? Maybe that\u2019s why the teachers were troubled when Anise came here.)Kanata felt a little sorry for the teachers.\u201cIf things turn out like this, I want to be in the S class too\u2026 but that\u2019s selfish of me, and as a princess, it\u2019s not allowed\u2026 Uu, Kanata-kun!!\u201d\u201cWhat do you want me to do\u2026\u201dHe sat down on a nearby bench to relax a bit with Maria, who lightly tapped him on the chest.Somehow, it\u2019s quite rare for Kanata and Maria to be alone together like this, and while Kanata felt a bit nervous, Maria looked very happy.\u201cKanata-kun \u266a.\u201dResting her head on Kanata\u2019s shoulder, Maria had a dazzling smile that completely hid her previous demeanor.Since confessing her feelings to Kanata, Maria had increased these kinds of physical interactions, making Kanata\u2019s heart flutter with any contact.Compared to Alphana, Maria had a certain elegance and a lack of composure, but there was no doubt that she possessed many charms as a woman.\u201c\u2026 Just calm down.\u201dKanata murmured softly.Spending this leisurely time with a girl who had undoubtedly become an important existence to him was truly something precious to Kanata.In this world, which could be described as bloody and where danger lurked around every corner, especially compared to his previous life in Japan, peaceful moments like this held great value.\u201c\u2026 Alright.\u201dSummoning his courage, Kanata extended his arm.In a posture that could be considered embracing, he reached out to hold Maria\u2019s shoulder. Amidst the uncertainties and unanswered questions, Kanata didn\u2019t know if this action was truly the right thing to do.\u201c\u2026 Fufu \u266a.\u201dBut even so, Maria looked happy.After maintaining that position for a while, Maria suddenly said something.\u201cKanata-kun, if we continue like this, it\u2019s going to be quite something, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201cQuite something?\u201dKanata tilted his head in confusion, and Maria continued her words.\u201cA lot of girls, including me, Alphana, and Anise this time, are gathering. They say heroes attract attention, so maybe you should be aware that you\u2019ll get surrounded by many women from now on?\u201d\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe so-called harem. A dream any man has at least once. Naturally, Kanata has that longing too, but in reality, it seems quite challenging.While feeling complex about Maria\u2019s words, there was a hidden excitement within Kanata, proof of him being a man.\u201cOh, there you are!\u201dAs Kanata and Maria were spending their time leisurely, another voice echoed.It was clear who the voice belonged to.She suddenly appeared and silently sat down beside Kanata, sandwiching him between them.\u201cKanata \u266a.\u201dOf course, it was Anise.Perhaps she\u2019s the one who expressed her affection to Kanata the most directly among the women he has met so far. She wholeheartedly showed her love for Kanata.\u201cHey, Anise, why are you in the S class?\u201d\u201cI told the teacher I really wanted to be in the S class!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Just like that? What about the rules? What about the rules?!\u201dIn a sense, you could say she\u2019s quick-witted or flexible\u2026 Well, from Maria\u2019s perspective, who knows. But she doesn\u2019t intend to complain too much about it.(\u2026 It feels like I\u2019m doing something really bad.)Spending this bright moment with two girls, Kanata couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of guilt.It\u2019s true that Kanata\u2019s former values hindered him, but perhaps it\u2019s good to firmly instill in his mind and body that he is now living in this other world.\u201cBy the way, you know\u2026 The Kingdom is quite leisurely compared to the Empire.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like, there\u2019s less bloodshed, fewer conflicts among students, and it\u2019s a bit boring.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard about it, but is the Empire really like that?\u201dKanata didn\u2019t understand what Anise was talking about.Then Anise explained. It appears that conflicts among students are a common occurrence in the Empire.It seems to happen due to the urge for battle that stirs the blood, but Kanata couldn\u2019t help but imagine the horrifying scenes that would never be seen in the Kingdom, and he uttered these next words.\u201c\u2026 A gathering of battle maniacs, huh?\u201d\u201cHahaha, you said it. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong.\u201dPeople of the Empire fundamentally have the idea of understanding themselves through battle, experiencing the reality of life through battle, and seeking their end in battle.The term \u2018battle maniac\u2019 Kanata mentioned truly suits them.As the most powerful military nation in this world, the Empire is the last country you want to make enemies with. So for the Kingdom and other allied countries, there is no other entity that can provide as much reassurance.\u201cCome to think of it. Fest seemed to be enjoying himself when he charged in alone\u2026 If someone like him appeared on the battlefield, the enemy would definitely hate it, right?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s true. I\u2019m the same as Fest, with the same blood flowing in me.\u201dIn other words, Anise and Fest can be described as battle maniacs.When Kanata had a one-on-one match with Anise, he didn\u2019t see that side of her much. But he recalls the time they faced Fest together with Maria and Alphana, and he seemed to be enjoying himself.\u201cPlease, restrain yourself when you\u2019re here, okay?\u201d\u201cI know, geez. I\u2019m a shy and quiet girl in front of the person I love, you know \u266a.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cHa?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dAnise seemed dissatisfied with Kanata and Maria\u2019s dumbfounded expressions.Being honest with her affection means that even when she\u2019s dissatisfied, it shows in her attitude. However, in Anise\u2019s case, even that seems to transform into affection towards Kanata.\u201cMuu!\u201d\u201cMmmph!?\u201dAnise suddenly embraced Kanata\u2019s head against her own chest.Startled by the sudden action, Kanata tried to pull away, but Anise didn\u2019t let him go and enveloped him with the sensation of her ample bosom.\u201cThis is how I\u2019ll treat you when you react like earlier\u2026 How does it feel, struggling like this? Reflect on your actions, okay!?\u201dAlthough she meant it as a punishment, it didn\u2019t feel like a punishment at all.And so, they spent a lively after-school time like that. Then, Kanata returned to the dormitory, feeling a sense of relief.\u201cOh, Kanata-kun. Just in time.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dKanata stopped as the dormitory head called out to him.\u201cThere\u2019s a delivery for you, Kanata-kun.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah, I see. Thank you.\u201dIt was quite a large box.Kanata checked the sender, and it had the names of Cid and Athena written on it from the principality.\u201cThey finally did it!\u201dKanata immediately brought the package to his room, trying to contain his excitement, and opened the box.\u201cOh\u2026 I didn\u2019t specifically ask them to go this far\u2026 but it looks pretty good!\u201dIt was the ASMR microphone he had requested. It had finally arrived at Kanata\u2019s doorstep.Now, the forbidden door has been opened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84: Whispering Of The Light\u201cWow, it\u2019s really impressive!\u201dKanata complimented as he looked at the specialized microphone before him.Finally, the ASMR microphone he had requested had arrived from Cid, even though he hadn\u2019t asked for it. Its design seemed to understand Kanata\u2019s thoughts completely as if it were made specifically for him.The shape, resembling a human head, would surely play a significant role in conveying Kanata\u2019s emotions to his audience.\u201cI believe it\u2019s called a binaural microphone\u2026 In my previous world, I never had the chance to buy something like this. It\u2019s amazing to think I can find it in this world.\u201dHe sincerely thanked Cid for reminding him of the connections from his past life.Although Cid was the one who crafted this microphone, Athena had provided significant assistance in obtaining the necessary materials. Kanata felt the need to express his gratitude to both of them.\u201cSo finally\u2026\u201dWith this microphone, he was fully prepared for ASMR.However, whether he should do a live stream where many listeners would listen to it was another question, and Kanata was still undecided.\u201cI did try to create scripts that catered mostly to a female audience\u2026 But the thought of other men listening to them is h**l for me.\u201dThe lines he had prepared, which Maria, Alphana, Mira, and Anise had listened to, were heavily tailored for women and made him cringe. Kanata believed it would be mentally challenging for men to listen to them as well.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, can\u2019t we somehow limit it to a specific audience\u2026 Or should I just boldly try it once and say, \u2018This is what it is\u2019?\u201dAfter that, Kanata kept thinking about how to present it until finishing dinner after taking a bath.\u201cOh, is it already this late?\u201dLying on the bed, Kanata was lost in his thoughts for quite some time. Even though he hadn\u2019t intended to stream that night and wasn\u2019t quite ready to sleep, he realized that merely pondering wouldn\u2019t lead to a clear solution.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dIt was perhaps due to endlessly thinking on the bed that a woman unforgettable to Kanata appeared in his room after a long time.\u201cWhat are you so troubled about?\u201dIt was the Goddess Isla, appearing without a sound.Her knack for appearing out of nowhere hadn\u2019t changed, and her otherworldly beauty was offset by the Haishin-sama shirt she wore, making Kanata unable to react at all.\u201cOh, Isla. What is it?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018what is it\u2019? Your reaction is so cold, Kanata.\u201dIsla pouted and lay down next to Kanata on the bed. She brought her beautiful face close to Kanata\u2019s and smiled sweetly.\u201cWell\u2026\u201dEven though Kanata\u2019s initial response was lackluster due to her sudden appearance, as mentioned earlier, Isla\u2019s beauty was truly otherworldly. In other words, it was only natural for Kanata to be taken aback by it.\u201cI won\u2019t let you escape.\u201d\u201cMmmph!?\u201dHowever, this was the physical prowess of a goddess.Kanata tried to sit up to distance himself, but Isla\u2019s arm held his head tightly. Captured, he got drawn towards her chest.His head was nestled in the ample cleavage, unable to even breathe properly due to the softness pressing against his face.\u201cOh, you can\u2019t breathe? You\u2019ll be fine like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dKanata thought Isla was doing something to him, but the discomfort disappeared.\u201cI\u2019m directly sending air into you now. So don\u2019t worry. Air should circulate properly.\u201d\u201c\u2026~ ~ ~ !!\u201d\u201cHey, don\u2019t struggle too much inside a woman\u2019s chest.\u201dStill, Kanata was eager to be released.Perhaps finding even his attempts to escape endearing, Isla demonstrated another unconventional feat that would defy Kanata\u2019s common sense.\u201cWell then, let\u2019s do this. Now you won\u2019t be able to escape from me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201dIt was a strange sensation.As if his entire body got enveloped in something, and before Kanata could even question it, his freedom of movement got taken away.\u201cHey, what\u2019s happening?\u201d\u201cNow, you are assimilating with my body. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t escape.\u201dIndeed, it was exactly as she said.Kanata\u2019s body, embraced by Isla, had become partially assimilated with her body. It felt as if everything, from the blood flowing through his veins to the beating of his heart, was in perfect sync with Isla, creating an illusion of complete unity.\u201cI must say, it\u2019s quite something to experience this sense of unity\u2026 Fufu, it\u2019s a realm impossible to reach through mere physical intimacy between a man and a woman, don\u2019t you think?\u201dIndeed, Isla\u2019s words were true, but this kind of realm was not what Kanata desired.Sensing that Kanata was not welcoming the situation, Isla tilted her head in confusion and reluctantly released him.\u201cI\u2026 went through a lot just now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you were struggling.\u201d\u201cNo, I admit the sensation of your chest was incredibly amazing. I acknowledge that. But things can get dangerous when it\u2019s you, Isla, you know?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being mean. I\u2019m a kind goddess present anywhere.\u201dAlthough Kanata thought her definition of \u2018kind\u2019 was different, he chose not to voice it further to avoid further trouble.Isla was without a doubt a goddess-like figure worshiped in this world, but she also seemed interested in the binaural microphone.\u201cOh my, what is this?\u201d\u201cOh, that is\u2026\u201dKanata explained what the microphone was and how it was used.\u201cASMR, huh\u2026 Will it create a different sensation from your previous streams?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. I\u2019ve been pondering about that.\u201dObserving Kanata, who crossed his arms and started thinking again, Isla clapped her hands.\u201cIn that case, Kanata, why don\u2019t you let me listen to it?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m curious, you know. As this world\u2019s Goddess, it\u2019s important I am the first to know what kind of power it holds!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hmm.\u201dHe certainly wanted to test whether this microphone would function properly and demonstrate its effectiveness. He had planned to seek assistance from Maria and the others, but it was fortunate that Isla offered to help in this way.\u201cOkay, let me prepare a bit.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dWell, regardless of everything, Kanata also wanted to try using this microphone as soon as possible. Although it was called \u2018preparation,\u2019 it didn\u2019t take long, and the space for showcasing the ASMR was quickly set up.\u201cI\u2019ve got to put this on, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. Ideally, headphones or something similar would work better\u2026\u201d\u201cHeadphones?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 Just think of it as something that covers the entire ear like those earphones.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dAs for the headphones, Kanata thought he should consult with Cid about it later.With such thoughts in mind, Kanata powered on the terminal. Isla had already put the earphones on and was eagerly looking at Kanata, excited about what would happen.(\u2026 But what kind of lines should I use?)Kanata pondered what words would resonate with her as a goddess and blew into the microphone as a trial.\u201cHuh!?\u201dIn that instant, Isla exclaimed in surprise.Rubbing her ears, she widened her eyes. Gradually, her cheeks flushed, and her gaze toward Kanata became heated.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m perfectly fine!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHe ended up calling out just like that, but Isla\u2019s reaction was proof this microphone was functioning properly.Even without such a microphone, Kanata\u2019s voice, thanks to his magical power, would be converted into the most easily understandable voice that resonates with the listener\u2019s brain. It could be said that once the boost was applied to that voice, the effect became even more pronounced.Kanata stepped away from the microphone for a moment.\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll just\u2026 Or rather, I\u2019ll make up various situations and speak accordingly. Let me know your impressions later. Of course, please understand that I have no intention of demeaning or humiliating the Goddess Isla in any way.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Even if you were to say anything to me, it wouldn\u2019t hurt me.\u201dKanata was grateful for those comforting words.He approached the microphone and brought his face close to the part shaped like an ear.(Should I go with the vibe of an obsessive male who can\u2019t stop thinking about a beautiful goddess?)Kanata understood what kind of lines would resonate, as yandere was his favorite, so he knew what would work.\u201cIsla\u2026\u201d\u201c!?\u201dIsla\u2019s body trembled.Since Kanata didn\u2019t know how his voice was being transformed, he continued while observing her reaction.\u201cIsla, why do you look at other people? You\u2019re supposed to be my goddess. Don\u2019t make me jealous anymore. Please.\u201d\u201cS-stop\u2026 just a moment\u2026\u201d\u201cEven though I love you so much\u2026 Why do you always make me feel like this, Isla? If you make me feel like this any longer\u2014\u201d\u201cNo, stop\u2026 my mind is being violated\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to make you mine and mine alone.\u201dBy the way, Kanata felt embarrassed while uttering these lines.Nevertheless, he did it in order to test the effectiveness of the microphone\u2026 but that\u2019s as far as Kanata could go with the lines.\u201c\u2026 Nooo \u266a.\u201d\u201cH-hey!?\u201d\u201cA-Ah\u2026!\u201dIsla\u2019s body disappeared as if turning into particles.It seemed shouting loudly through the microphone was the trigger for her strange behaviour, and Isla lost her power and returned to her original place.At the moment she disappeared, it was clear that her nose was bleeding and her body was convulsing immensely.\u201c\u2026 smells kinda sweet?\u201dKanata\u2019s bed, where Isla was sitting, was soaking wet.Kanata folded the sheets and left the room to do the laundry, wondering what exactly caused it to become so wet.*****\u201cHey! Isla, are you okay!?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t touch me right now!\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying!? What happened!?\u201d\u201cA-Ahhhhhhhh \u266a\u266a.\u201dWhat transpired in the vast sky above, only the goddesses knew.However, it was certain that Isla became the first victim of the ASMR and remained unconscious for a while.As a result, the magical power she had been using weakened, and the camouflage placed on Kanata began to fade away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85: It Was Too Early For Mankind\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dIt was a little while after the event that could be called an experiment using binaural microphones, or ASMR.Although Kanata was concerned about Isla, who had suddenly disappeared, there was nothing he could do about it, so he let it go.After tidying up the broadcasting equipment and microphone, Kanata was about to sleep when another beautiful woman appeared silently before him.\u201c\u2026 Who?\u201dThis woman, with a tan complexion, unlike Isla\u2019s fair skin, was incredibly beautiful.She exuded a sacred aura, just like Isla. Kanata was certainly surprised but decided to quietly wait for the woman to speak.\u201cIt seems you\u2019re surprised by my sudden appearance, but that\u2019s understandable. To explain simply, I\u2019m kinda Isla\u2019s colleague who was here earlier.\u201d\u201c\u2026 So, you\u2019re a Goddess?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Oh, don\u2019t be so tense. You can be your usual self with me, okay?\u201dWith that, Kanata decided to interact with her in his usual manner.\u201cIt was already time for you to sleep, wasn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t intend to take up too much of your time. I\u2019ll just explain what is happening to you right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Something is happening to me?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 You can call me Leanne. I probably won\u2019t be around much longer, so you don\u2019t have to remember it if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dShe introduced herself as Leanne.However, Kanata was more curious about what was happening to him than her name.Nothing particularly unusual had happened to him, and he didn\u2019t feel any different than usual, but it bothered him.\u201cYou were under Isla\u2019s magic all this time.\u201d\u201cIsla\u2019s magic?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThen Leanne explained in detail.Apparently, Kanata had been affected by Isla\u2019s magic, which distorted people\u2019s perceptions. The reason things didn\u2019t become a big issue, even with Maria, the Princess, and Alphana, the Saint, being with him, was because of that magic.\u201cSo, that\u2019s why it was so easy for them to accompany me to my hometown\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Normally, interfering with the consciousness of the people living in that world is an act not allowed for the goddess who manages that world\u2026 Well, it\u2019s her we\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201c\u2026 So, Isla is known for that kind of thing?\u201dLeanne nodded deeply in agreement.Although she had said she would disappear soon, Kanata still offered Leanne some tea.\u201cThank you.\u201dLeanne sat down next to Kanata on his bed.\u201cIt tastes delicious. So, this is the tea from the mortal realm.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s delicious, right? I\u2019m quite fond of it.\u201d\u201cI see. This flavour, too, is something created by the people living in this world\u2026 It\u2019s truly wonderful and precious.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dLeanne\u2019s words were filled with compassion for the people.Truly, it made Kanata feel that this was how a goddess should be. Leanne\u2019s smile was so beautiful.After drinking all the tea in the cup and taking a moment to compose herself, Leanne began to speak again.\u201cLet\u2019s get back to the topic. There was a camouflage magic cast on you in this world, making your existence ambiguous. But I want you to understand that it was all done out of concern for you. Isla, as a goddess, possesses extraordinary power, a strong ego and possessiveness\u2026 I truly question how someone like her became a goddess, but nevertheless, she cares about you deeply.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Um, I\u2019m not sure if I should be happy or exasperated.\u201d\u2014Indeed, Leanne laughed at that response.\u201cEven if you behaved in a way that made others question it to some extent, Isla\u2019s magic made it ambiguous by seeping into the consciousness of the people around you. However, due to a minor issue Isla encountered, that magic has been lifted.\u201d\u201cDid I, like, do something?\u201d\u201cYou did. You completely made Isla ascend to heaven.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThough he really didn\u2019t want to think that ASMR was the cause\u2026 Leanne pointed her finger at the neatly arranged binaural microphone on the desk.\u201cMost likely, that\u2019s the cause.\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d\u201cCan you explain what it is?\u201dKanata proceeded to explain ASMR to Leanne, using the same explanation he had given to Isla. Naturally, Leanne had no knowledge of what ASMR was since it was unfamiliar to her.\u201cIn the world I came from, it was quite common.\u201d\u201cI see. Well, assuming that was the cause, I would like to give you some caution.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Understood.\u201dKanata had a vague idea of what she was going to say, but he straightened his posture and listened attentively to Leanne\u2019s words.Perhaps finding Kanata\u2019s demeanour cute, Leanne reached out and gently stroked his head.\u201cWhy are you stroking my head?\u201d\u201cBecause I think you\u2019re cute. Now, let me explain.\u201dOne by one, Leanne raised her fingers and began explaining to Kanata as if reminding him.\u201cIt will take a few days for Isla to fully recover. During that time, the magic cast on this world will not function, so if you act conspicuously without thinking, your true identity will be sniffed out immediately. Even if the children you trust make efforts, there will always be limits to what they can do.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah.\u201d\u201cIt should be fine to talk at the academy, but if you spend time privately with the Princess or the Saint, or if you go out, more people will notice.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yeah, I guess.\u201dFor the most part, Kanata didn\u2019t question it much until now.But the fact that there had been no remarks was abnormal considering the people he interacted with were important women in this country.Well, the interactions within the academy were as usual, and he had no plans to go out anywhere, so it didn\u2019t seem like something to worry too much about.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to overthink it. If anything, it wouldn\u2019t be bad to act freely and go as far as you want. Once Isla regains her powers, memories can be altered as much as needed.\u201d\u201cCan you also do that?\u201d\u201cOf course, I can do it as well, but the extent of my power is limited to the world I govern.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dIt seemed the powers of a goddess had various constraints.For now, it seemed best to refrain from engaging in conspicuous actions through this conversation with Leanne and minimize close interactions with Maria and Alphana.(\u2026 It feels somewhat lonely.)As Kanata considered the restrictions placed on their previous interactions, a slight sense of loneliness emerged within him.He was well aware of the reason behind that loneliness and couldn\u2019t help but smile wryly, realizing that he was indeed attracted to them as well.\u201cYou have a nice smile. Boys are cuter when they smile innocently without being told.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I love little boys, you know? I\u2019m weak to their innocent expressions, unaware of the harsh realities of the world.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Shotacon?\u201d\u201cShotacon? What\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cNever mind.\u201dKanata distanced himself a little from Leanne.It seemed that she had somewhat of a deep interest, or rather, a fetish-like preference, and her dignified image had crumbled, albeit only slightly.\u201cAs I mentioned earlier, you don\u2019t have to think too deeply about it. Just be a little cautious, and it should be fine. You have reliable friends around you, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 true.\u201dThe faces of many people who would support Kanata, including Maria and Alphana, came to his mind, even while being aware of Haishin\u2019s presence. Thinking of them, he felt reassured, as if everything would be fine.\u201cWell then, I should be heading back soon\u2026 Oh, but before that, could you let me experience this thing called ASMR for a bit?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Is that okay?\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve been listening to your podcasts, you know? Maybe not as much as Isla, but I always look forward to them.\u201dLeanne was also one of the listeners.Although Kanata felt grateful for that, he was too afraid to ask what role he had become among the goddesses.For Leanne, who had expressed a desire to experience it, Kanata set up the microphone once more.\u201cShall we begin?\u201d\u201cPlease.\u201dAfterward, Kanata performed the same content as he did for Isla.When it was over, Leanne seemed to experience a dizzying sensation, albeit not as intense as Isla, and she kept fidgeting with her hips.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s incredible. It feels like my brain is being invaded\u2026 Those who like you must find this irresistible. It\u2019s truly like a drug.\u201d\u201cIs it really that intense?\u201d\u201cMm. If I were to put it into words\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an entertainment too advanced for mankind.\u201dWith those words, Leanne disappeared.Kanata decided to take ASMR more seriously and planned to inform Maria and Alphana to be cautious for the next few days.And so, the magic that had been protecting Kanata was lifted.While he still needed to be cautious about his actions to some extent, Kanata had forgotten one important thing.It was about the girls he had met.The Princess, the Saint, the Demon King, the Assassin, the Duchess, and the Courtesan. Even if they were to find out that Kanata was Haishin, there were significant individuals among his fans.Would these individuals silently stand by if something threatening approached Kanata?\u2026 Probably not, right?It will be fine, Kanata. You can relax and trust that everything will be alright!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86: Wake Up Already\u201cWell then, let\u2019s go.\u201dIt was the day after Isla had suffered from the effects of ASMR, and Leanne informed him of the aftermath and the potential events to come.Until leaving the dormitory, Kanata was feeling a bit jittery.Although there was no clear indication or noticeable sensation that Isla\u2019s magic had been undone, Kanata couldn\u2019t help but be slightly wary now that there was a greater chance of being exposed as Haishin in certain circumstances.\u201c\u2026 Well, I did have some thoughts about Maria and Alphana, but it does seem strange if things don\u2019t turn out that way.\u201dKanata nodded, admitting that he had been a bit naive.However, he didn\u2019t mean to keep them away from him until Isla woke up.He couldn\u2019t resort to forcefully distancing them just to protect his secret, considering that they had already expressed their feelings to him and they had done so much to help him. In light of that, he couldn\u2019t employ a method that would alienate them.\u201cI might get called naive, but I\u2019m just a kid after all. In the end, things will turn out the way they\u2019re meant to.\u201dKanata chuckled.Leanne had also mentioned it when she left, but being overly sensitive would only tire him out.While the magic had indeed come undone, just having a good relationship with Maria and Alphana wouldn\u2019t necessarily lead to others thinking he was Haishin.Ultimately, there was no evidence to definitively conclude that Kanata was Haishin.\u201cOh, thinking that way has put my mind at ease.\u201dOf course, it was important to remain cautious.With this renewed mindset, Kanata stepped into the academy and headed straight to the classroom.\u201cKanata!\u201d\u201cOh, hey there.\u201dThe moment he entered the classroom, a soft sensation swept away all the commotion around him. Only one person had such a voice and would suddenly cling to him like this\u2014Anise, a new source of worry for Kanata.\u201cGood morning, Kanata\u2026 Is something troubling you?\u201d\u201c\u2026 No.\u201dIt seemed those observant enough could easily tell just by looking at Kanata. It was somewhat surprising that Anise noticed it before Maria or Alphana, but she had indeed pursued Kanata all the way from the Empire, so it was to be expected.Moreover, despite Kanata being in the midst of various worries, Anise\u2019s unchanged demeanour somehow helped ease the tension on his shoulders.\u201cHaha\u2026 Anise, you really haven\u2019t changed. Even though you just arrived here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFeeling the tension ease, Kanata smiled a little.Anise widened her eyes for a moment, then suddenly looked down, her earlier enthusiasm diminishing slightly.Inevitably, with things turning out this way, it was only natural for Alphana, who was in the same class, to come closer to Kanata.\u201cKanata-sama, may I have a moment?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, uh\u2026 Sure.\u201dHowever, she seemed different from her usual self, who always greeted him with a smile in the morning.Anise also seemed to sense the atmosphere and distanced herself from Kanata but still seemed determined to stick around.As Leanne had warned, they immediately attracted some attention, but the fact that it was a scene that hadn\u2019t changed much from before seemed to have taken root in their classmates\u2019 minds.\u201cIs it okay here?\u201dThey moved away from the noise\u2026 Well, they just moved to a corner of the classroom.Alphana activated magic to block their voices from being overheard or seen as suspicious, allowing Kanata, Alphana and Anise to have a conversation.\u201cActually, this morning\u2026 No, I should say last night. The Goddess appeared in my dream.\u201d\u201cR-really?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c??\u201dIt seemed Alphana had heard directly from Isla about what was happening to Kanata in the form of a dream. She had already shared this information with Maria, who was in a different class, so Kanata didn\u2019t need to explain it again.\u201cI see. You guys did appear together in a stream once, and considering that, it\u2019s not surprising for people to suspect Kanata, who is close to a man of similar height. Honestly, I thought it was odd how familiar you were during the banquet as well.\u201dIndeed, there were others who shared Anise\u2019s thoughts.Still, the fact that their thoughts had momentarily come to a halt was Isla\u2019s doing, and although she had her own problems as a goddess, it was certain she had helped Kanata in ways he didn\u2019t know about.\u201c\u2026 I should express my gratitude. It seems like she was worried about me, despite everything.\u201dBy the way, Leanne had told him that expressing gratitude to Isla wasn\u2019t necessary. Although Kanata had questioned that, he decided to thank her when they met after her recovery.\u201cBut\u2026 Well, naturally, I also heard the cause. The ASMR that we experienced, I never expected even the Goddess to be affected like that.\u201d\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think it would go this far either. I mean, ASMR does give you that tingling sensation on your back, but it shouldn\u2019t go to that extent, right?\u201dIn Kanata\u2019s memory, ASMR didn\u2019t have that kind of power.There were even sleep ASMR videos meant to be relaxing, nothing more than a slightly pleasant feeling.\u201c\u2026 But I kind of understand, you know?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dAnise interjected, resting her chin on her hand.\u201cAt that time, during the mock battle, I felt like Kanata was delivering the finishing blow to me\u2026 Oh. Is it okay to talk about this indelicate topic, Saint-sama?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cGood. Then I\u2019ll speak openly.\u201dWith that said, Anise continued.\u201cThe pleasure that the listener would most likely feel, or rather, the sensation that the brain readily accepts, is converted in such a way\u2026 And on top of that, it\u2019s whispered by our beloved Kanata\u2026 So, it\u2019s only natural that the lower abdomen would ache and become soaking wet, right?\u201dAnise\u2019s words left nothing to the imagination.It was true that Kanata had noticed Anise\u2019s body trembling, but he never expected it to go to that extent.\u201c\u2026 When I played it for Isla, I used specialized equipment for ASMR. Maybe that increased its impact compared to when Anise listened to it.\u201d\u201cIt seems so.\u201d\u201cHuh? More than that?\u201dAlthough Alphana seemed to already know from her conversation with Isla, it was news to Anise, and she appeared quite intrigued. Her gaze fixed on Kanata was filled with hearts as if she wanted to listen to it right away.\u201cAnyway, until the Goddess recovers, it seems we need to be careful about various things.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity. Not being able to embrace Kanata-sama or enjoy the sensation of his well-developed chest\u2026 And we can\u2019t have secret rendezvous or such things either. It\u2019s quite frustrating.\u201d\u201cAlphana-san?\u201dIt seemed Alphana had no intention of hiding things from Anise. She openly talked about it, almost provoking Anise, which was unusual for Alphana.\u201cThe Kingdom\u2019s Holy Maiden is renowned for her overflowing compassion\u2026 But it seems that\u2019s how it turns out when love is involved, right? But I like that.\u201d\u201cI expected you to say that, Anise-san.\u201d\u201cUfufu \u266a.\u201dAnd once again, Alphana and Anise found common ground.After such exchanges, their usual academy life resumed. However, it was clear that simply going about things, as usual, wouldn\u2019t resolve everything.If they were to return to Kanata\u2019s hometown in their current state, it would be a different story, but there were no plans for that, nor was there anything to be done about it.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dIt seemed that as long as they lived as students without causing any trouble, there wouldn\u2019t be any issues.Kanata continued to demonstrate magic in class as he usually did, occasionally drawing jealous glances. Even with Anise sticking close to him, nothing seemed to have changed.They could only hope that things would stay that way\u2026Until Isla woke up, just a few more days remained.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: It Doesn\u2019t Seem to Matter That Much\u201cWell then, Kanata-sama, let\u2019s meet again tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYeah. Alphana, do your best with the Harvest Festival preparations.\u201d\u201cYes \u266a.\u201dAfter school, Alphana headed towards the imminent Harvest Festival meeting.Kanata conveyed they would meet again tomorrow, and Alphana\u2019s delighted smile was truly heartwarming.\u201cThe festival is just around the corner, and Alphana is desperate to make it great. I\u2019m sure Kanata\u2019s words will be a great source of strength.\u201d\u201cI hope so\u2026 but I can\u2019t help with that.\u201dKanata replied to Maria\u2019s words in that manner.At first, it was still fine, but the Harvest Festival was a special event. It was a festival conceived by the church itself. There were also events and information that couldn\u2019t be leaked, so unfortunately, all they could do now was look forward to the actual event.With that in mind, Kanata looked at Maria.\u201cWe\u2019re together like this, but has anything really changed?\u201d\u201cWell, not really. But they say complacency is the greatest enemy.\u201dEven though Isla\u2019s magic was undone, there hadn\u2019t been much change while they were still at the academy. Perhaps because it was an unchanged sight for the students and teachers, there wasn\u2019t much need to be particularly cautious.\u201cWhen I heard it from Alphana, I was surprised and still feel that way. But nothing has changed for us, so it\u2019s easy to let our guard down.\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s no point in worrying too much. I told Alphana the same thing, but Maria, try not to overthink it too much, okay?\u201d\u201cI know. Fufu, could it be that you\u2019re feeling lonely?\u201dKanata averted his gaze from Maria, who smiled mischievously.While Maria playfully pressed her index finger against Kanata\u2019s cheek, she chuckled and shook her shoulders.However, there was something else.Even though Maria and Alphana were by his side, Anise was a presence that stood out more than them due to her talkativeness.\u201cHey, what are we going to do now?\u201dHer clingy presence was truly significant to Kanata.It was to the point where she grabbed more attention than Maria and Alphana.As for what they would do next, Maria sighed disappointedly.\u201cActually, I have to head to the castle now. My father and mother have summoned me.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about, but I have to go for now.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dSaying they would meet again tomorrow, Maria turned her back and walked away.Kanata and Anise watched her as she left, but since Kanata didn\u2019t have any specific plans, he planned on returning to the dormitory\u2026 Well, Anise definitely wouldn\u2019t allow that.\u201cCan we go now?\u201d\u201cSure?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Oh, really?\u201dNo, it seemed like it was completely fine.Having been slightly disappointed, Kanata said his farewell and tried to leave, but Anise stuck closely to him.If Kanata stopped, Anise would stop, and if he started walking, she would follow.\u201cUm\u2026 Anise?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m going back.\u201d\u201cYeah? I was thinking of coming along \u266a.\u201dKanata looked dumb with his mouth open.It seemed Anise interpreted his question of whether it was okay to go back as something else entirely. She seemed to have misunderstood it as an invitation to accompany him back to the dormitory.\u201cNo, this is where we say goodbye.\u201d\u201cEhh?\u201dAnise made a visibly dissatisfied expression.It\u2019s not that he disliked the idea of inviting her to his room, but there are more people around now compared to when Alphana came before, and there are certain circumstances to consider.Although her face showed discontent, she nodded, indicating that she understood and didn\u2019t have any ulterior motives to truly trouble Kanata.\u201cI don\u2019t want to cause too much inconvenience, and I really, really want to be with Kanata more, but I\u2019ll give up on going to your room.\u201dShe said that, but if she had animal ears, they would undoubtedly have drooped down.She hadn\u2019t made a friend yet, and Kanata and the others were the only ones she could talk to comfortably in this royal capital.\u201c\u2026 I see. Then, let\u2019s stay together a little longer. I\u2019ll show you around the city too.\u201d\u201cReally!?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cYay!\u201dAnise jumped up and down in joy.The sight of her large bouncing chest was quite the spectacle, but Kanata placed his hand on Anise\u2019s shoulder, telling her to calm down.\u201cAlright, then, let\u2019s stroll around casually.\u201d\u201cGot it. Fufu, a date with Kanata \u266a. A date with Kanata \u266a.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Jeez.\u201dEven so, if she\u2019s happy like that, Kanata can\u2019t help but let a smile escape.Afterward, Kanata headed to the castle town with Anise.\u201cCompared to the Empire, it\u2019s\u2026 peaceful.\u201d\u201cWait, isn\u2019t this how towns usually are?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true for now. But the cityscape in the former Empire was quite terrible. Discrimination against commoners by the nobles was an everyday occurrence.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is that so?\u201dKanata hadn\u2019t personally witnessed those scenes, but perhaps there were discriminations like the ones he had seen in manga and anime from his previous life.\u201cBut you know what? It was Kanata\u2019s words as Haishin that changed the Empire.\u201dAnise told him that it was he who changed the Empire.It was quite refreshing to hear about the changes from a local perspective, and it made Kanata realize the significant influence his words had.\u201cWell, I\u2019m not that big of a presence. I\u2019m just a guy who found something fun to do with streaming.\u201dKanata had no intention of changing the world. He still held the belief that as long as he could enjoy streaming, that was enough.Anise seemed to understand that well, as she didn\u2019t start talking about Kanata\u2019s great achievements.Afterward, Kanata continued strolling through the town with Anise.They bought snacks at the shops Kanata often visited, and although he wasn\u2019t exactly suitable for escorting a lady, Anise seemed happy throughout the entire time.\u201cSpeaking of which\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dWhile taking a break, sitting on a bench, Kanata suddenly had something he wanted to ask.\u201cDid you start liking Haishin from the very beginning, Anise?\u201d\u201cOf course I did!!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked,\u201d Anise enthusiastically started to speak.\u201cWhen I listened to your first stream, something in me changed. It felt like a turning point in time, you know? I had this intuition that I would regret it if I missed out.\u201d\u201cReally? That much?\u201d\u201cYeah. And I wasn\u2019t wrong. I quickly got hooked on your streams and wanted to meet the person behind them more and more\u2026 Fufu. My dream came true \u266a.\u201dKanata found it somewhat heartwarming to see how genuinely happy she was.Come to think of it, even in his previous life, many people fantasized about meeting famous streamers and becoming close to them. While Kanata didn\u2019t have such strong desires, that\u2019s precisely why he could understand Anise\u2019s feelings.\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you feel that way.\u201d\u201cYeah \u266a.\u201dKanata hoped to continue his streaming activities, not stopping for the sake of people like Anise who look forward to them.Now, as they were talking like that, something happened.\u201cKanata-sama.\u201d\u201cYeah? Oh, Mira.\u201dSuddenly, Mira was standing behind them, seemingly appearing out of nowhere.While Kanata was no longer surprised by her sudden appearance, Anise instinctively distanced herself from Mira and showed a sign of caution.\u201cKanata? Who is this girl\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Mira, introduce yourself.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWith an energetic response, Mira faced Anise.\u201cNice to meet you, Anise-sama. I am Mira. Um\u2026 I\u2019m also originally from the Empire, but I live in the royal capital because I want to be by Kanata-sama\u2019s side!\u201d\u201cHuh? You\u2019re from the Empire?\u201dAnise\u2019s guard was instantly lifted upon hearing they were from the same Empire.It seemed the connection of coming from the same hometown called for common topics of conversation. Afterward, Mira and Anise quickly hit it off and became friends.Somehow, the three of them ended up outside the royal capital, and for some reason, Mira and Anise were facing each other.\u201c\u2026 How did it come to this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s obvious, right? An encounter with the legendary assassin, Raven! I absolutely want to have a match with you!\u201dIn fact, Mira had also revealed that she was Raven.As Anise was aware of the legendary assassin known as Raven in the Empire, she was greatly surprised. However, with her inclination towards battles, she desired to fight against Mira.\u201cFor now\u2026 let\u2019s make sure nobody gets injured, okay?\u201d\u201cGot it \u266a.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dHowever, regardless of how it happened, this battle was bound to be a spectacle.On one side, the legendary assassin, and on the other, the Ice Witch who would shape the future of the Empire\u2026 The outcome of their fight was truly uncertain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88: Anise, the Battle Maniac\u201cFor now\u2026 let\u2019s make sure nobody gets injured, okay?\u201d\u201cGot it \u266a.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dKanata spoke, and the two nodded at each other.Honestly, Kanata felt uneasy about the two of them fighting in a place like this. However, it turned out all right considering they were outside the Royal Capital. In general, few people leave the capital\u2019s outer walls, such as merchants travelling to various places or adventurers heading to dungeons.\u201cThere\u2019s really no one around here. Well, it\u2019s quite far away too.\u201dEven though Kanata glanced around, there was not a single passerby in sight.Since Mira and Anise were supposed to be considering their surroundings to some extent, Kanata felt relieved somewhere deep in their heart, thinking they wouldn\u2019t cause a commotion that attracted too much attention.\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata swallowed his saliva, trying to alleviate the tension.Mira wielded her sword while Anise concentrated magical power in the palm of her hand.As the tense moment lingered, the two finally began to move.Anise conspicuously unleashed large-scale magic, causing numerous ice pillars to appear around her.\u201cAs impressive as ever.\u201dThe chilling cold that reached Kanata, with his experience from their mock battles, made him fully understand the power of this magic.In an instant, a world of ice was born, and within it, Mira swiftly dashed forward. Kanata watched the unfolding battle before his eyes with an excited feeling.The battlefield, which Kanata observed with bated breath, was a place forbidden for ordinary people.Mira fought without using magic, relying solely on her own skills, while Anise relied primarily on magic. Their fighting styles were completely different, and it was unclear which one had the advantage and which the disadvantage.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, unlike Mira, who maintained an unchanged expression, Anise\u2019s expression was stern.By unleashing large-scale ice magic, the entire vicinity transformed into a world of ice, but even in such an environment where her magic could be maximized, Anise never let her guard down.(Her opponent is a legendary assassin\u2026 Who kills her targets with terrifying speed and precise strikes. That\u2019s why a momentary opening could be fatal!)Her usual demeanour faded away, and she showed her face as the Ice Witch who confronted formidable enemies before her eyes.At the same time, in addition to the chilling blizzard swirling around, Anise\u2019s inner thoughts burned hotly in the face of a strong adversary.\u201cNow, now, entertain me!!\u201dHer battle-maniac side, which could be said to be a characteristic of the Imperials, manifested itself unabashedly.As Anise swung her arm, the ice responded by heading towards Mira, but Mira sliced through it all with her sword. Without making much noise, it was as if she was slicing through ham: silently and swiftly.\u201cErm, isn\u2019t that a bit of a drastic change in personality?\u201d\u201cDo you think so? Well, I want you to understand! It\u2019s because I\u2019m able to fight against Raven, you know! Battling formidable enemies is what brings the most enjoyment, yeeeeeaaaahhhh!!\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m also from the Empire, but I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t turn out like that.\u201dAfter hearing this exchange, Kanata nods in agreement.Not only Anise but Fest also had a battle-crazed temperament. This temperament was common among the people of the Empire.However, Mira, someone fundamentally composed, did not exhibit any of those traits because she had trained in the art of assassination as Raven. Assassins can\u2019t afford to make a fuss like this; it\u2019s a very simple concept.\u201cDon\u2019t hold back, okay? I don\u2019t think I can win, but as someone from the Empire, what I hate the most is being underestimated!\u201d\u201cYou can rest assured about that. I don\u2019t want to lose either, so I have no intention of holding back.\u201dThe moment Mira said those words, she disappeared from Anise\u2019s field of vision.Anise tried to scan her surroundings to figure out where she went but then almost instinctively created a wall of ice behind her.Just as she heard the sound of something piercing through the ice, she saw the tip of a sword emerging from the other side of the ice, right behind her.\u201c\u2026 Isn\u2019t that a bit too fast?\u201d\u201cMy proudest attribute is my speed, after all. But you defended your rear quite well, didn\u2019t you? Based on Anise-san\u2019s demeanour, you shouldn\u2019t have noticed at all.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just my intuition. But I\u2019m glad I was saved.\u201dAnise\u2019s wall behind her was truly like an instinct.Impressed by this, Mira, with her usual composure, remained unfazed. However, Anise tightly grasped Mira\u2019s sword without caring about injuring her own hand.\u201cI won\u2019t let you escape now!\u201d\u201c!?\u201dAnise\u2019s hand naturally got cut as she tightly gripped the sword.The bright red blood that flowed from her hand froze upon contact with her magic, turning into crimson ice that attacked Mira.Mira instinctively let go of her sword and distanced herself, but Anise didn\u2019t miss this golden opportunity.\u201cThis is it!!\u201dThe red and transparent ice mixed together, enveloping Mira.It formed an ice prison that took shape to prevent Mira from escaping. As Mira was completely trapped, she smiled.\u201c?\u201dNaturally, Anise tilted her head in confusion.She wondered what that smile meant, but at that moment, she felt a sword pressing against her neck.\u201cWha\u2026?\u201d\u201cCheckmate, I suppose?\u201dMira\u2019s voice, which shouldn\u2019t have been beside her, resonated.Mira had already closed in, appearing from where she was about to be enveloped by ice. With unimaginable speed and an absolute strike, she took down her opponent.If Anise were the target of an assassination, she would have undoubtedly gotten killed by now.\u201c\u2026 Sigh. I guess I lost.\u201dIn other words, with certain death, this mock battle would be Anise\u2019s defeat.While Anise never expected to win against a legendary assassin, losing still brought about a sense of frustration. She also lost to Kanata, but what overflowed out of her was the pleasure fluid, so that doesn\u2019t count.\u201cIndeed, I won with that last strike, but if you had used the ice more like a wall, it might have taken a bit more time. Nevertheless, I believe I would have shattered all the ice and dyed your throat crimson.\u201dMira declared that she could penetrate defences, no matter how formidable.\u201cTo protect Kanata-sama, I will defeat any enemy that comes our way. As long as I\u2019m determined, I will not lose to anyone \u266a.\u201d\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s good. I really like that about you.\u201dThe battle came to a conclusion, and the icy world dispelled.Kanata also joined them later and expressed his impression, but apparently, he had no idea what had been happening in the middle.By the way, Raven was supposed to be already dead, but Anise had always believed that Raven couldn\u2019t have died so easily.\u201cA princess, a saint, and even an assassin by Kanata\u2019s side\u2026 The defence is flawless, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 indeed what I think.\u201d\u201cYes! I won\u2019t let any enemies come near, no matter how many!\u201dMira placed her hand on her hip and proudly stood tall with her small frame and big chest. This sight not only captivated Kanata but also brought a smile to Anise\u2019s face.\u201cNevertheless, you truly are a legendary assassin, Mira. You\u2019re incredibly strong!\u201dIt was Anise\u2019s heartfelt admiration and comment.The battle against Raven, a living legend in the Empire, was undoubtedly an invaluable experience for Anise, even though she lost.\u201cIf there\u2019s a chance, I\u2019ll brag about it to Fest \u266a.\u201dAnise was clearly excited, thinking that he would surely be frustrated.For Anise, the joy of fighting against strong individuals was significant, but now, the presence of Kanata was even greater.That night, Anise\u2019s excitement from the battle continued.After finishing dinner and taking a bath, she laid down on the bed in her underwear.\u201cI remember he mentioned there would be a livestream today, right? Fufu. Let\u2019s listen to Kanata\u2019s voice while calming down this excitement \u266a.\u201dSitting on the bed with her back against the wall, Anise waited for the moment to come.[Hey, everyone! It\u2019s that time of the day again!]\u201cKyaaah!!!\u201dAnise let out a joyful scream.Using Kanata\u2019s voice coming from the terminal as her stimulus, Anise placed her fingers on the sensitive area over her underwear.However, something unexpected happened at that moment.\u201c\u2026 Huh? An earthquake?\u201dThe entire dormitory began to shake, disrupting Anise\u2019s enjoyable time.It was undoubtedly an earthquake, and it was bigger than she had anticipated. Anise showed a slight sense of panic, not because she was in danger but because it interrupted Kanata\u2019s livestream.[\u2026 It\u2019s shaking a lot.]The voice was clearly hearable. And then, Anise heard a sound as if something like dishes had fallen. Without thinking, she glanced towards the boys\u2019 dormitory, wondering if everything was alright.The shaking grew stronger, and it became evident that it was not an environment suitable for live streaming, as Kanata\u2019s voice could no longer be heard.\u201cIt\u2019s over\u2026 Well, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. I guess.\u201dThough she felt disappointed that the livestream had ended, her focus shifted from seeking comfort to worrying about Kanata. She no longer had the mood to soothe herself.As she put on her night clothes and began to button them up one by one, Anise suddenly realized something.\u201cThis earthquake might expose that Kanata is in the capital\u2026\u201dAnise\u2019s prediction turned out to be completely accurate the following day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89: Who is it? Who is it? Who is it~!?It was the next day.Kanata, who had come to the academy as usual, felt slightly\u2026 No, quite uncomfortable.\u201cHey, hey! Is Haishin in the capital after all!?\u201d\u201cI knew it!\u201d\u201cI wonder who it is!?\u201d\u201cBut no one should know, right\u2026? But maybe he\u2019s nearby!?\u201dMost students in the same class were making a fuss about Haishin.Due to the earthquake last night, Kanata cancelled the livestream, but it seemed to have become a kind of decisive blow.(\u2026 The emergency alarm also rang so loudly.)There is a buzzer-like device in this world that alerts during emergencies, and it could be heard throughout the capital. It was unfortunate that it got picked up by his microphone.It couldn\u2019t be helped since it wasn\u2019t a high-end microphone capable of picking up only Kanata\u2019s voice, but in a sense, Kanata\u2019s carelessness was clearly exposed.(\u2026 Sigh.)While listening to the commotion around him, Kanata let out a sigh.In the first place, Kanata never intended to stand out, and he had made sure his identity as Haishin would never be revealed.However, with Isla\u2019s magic being undone and reflecting on everything that had happened until now, he realized how inadequate his thinking had been.(\u2026 Was I really stupid? Maybe I underestimated it just because it\u2019s a different world.)Compared to his previous world, this world has a lag in technological advancements related to machinery, and because of that, Kanata never thought that his streaming activities would lead to identification, despite how prominent they may be.Well. At the point where Maria and Alphana had noticed, Kanata should have been more cautious and careful.\u201cYou seem troubled, Kanata.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Anise, huh?\u201dSitting next to him, Anise poked his cheek lightly.Anise, who could sense various things from Kanata\u2019s expression, didn\u2019t tease him but instead spoke gently to reassure him.\u201cEven if they conclude that Haishin is in the capital, no one knows who Haishin really is, so I don\u2019t think you need to worry too much, you know?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is that so?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not in Kanata\u2019s position, so I can\u2019t say for sure, but I think if you overthink it, your vulnerabilities will become more apparent, you know?\u201dIt was precisely because he didn\u2019t think enough that his vulnerabilities became exposed, but Kanata felt somewhat lighter after hearing Anise\u2019s words.Certainly, he admitted that he hadn\u2019t been thinking enough until now, and it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that he had only thought he was being cautious.(\u2026 Yeah, that\u2019s right. It\u2019s too late to dwell on it now.)Following Anise\u2019s suggestion, Kanata decided to let go of excessive concern.Well, even if he let go, it didn\u2019t mean he would stop thinking altogether. He just resolved to gather his spirit until Isla woke up.If he became too tense, he would get tired. And if the girls saw him in such a state, it would only worry them.\u201cFufu, your expression has brightened up.\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll try not to overthink things too much. Once Isla wakes up, she\u2019ll be able to handle various things for us.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Thinking about it again, it\u2019s amazing that she can interfere with people\u2019s perception, isn\u2019t it?\u201dKanata nodded.It\u2019s probably because she can do things like that that she was considered the Goddess. But if Kanata were someone purely born in this world, he wondered if his memories would get manipulated, and that thought scared him a little.\u201cWhen it comes to Haishin-sama, it\u2019s the talk of the academy, and it\u2019s a topic of conversation in the capital and among the nobles. Although the nobles find it somewhat distasteful.\u201dAlphana told Kanata that there were movements to investigate whether Haishin was in the capital precisely because some nobles disliked him.Fortunately, Mira had already caught wind of that and was protecting Kanata, so he felt very reassured.\u201cAlphana, you don\u2019t have to worry too much about me, okay? Just focus on the Harvest Festival.\u201d\u201cYes. Please take care so that I don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dKanata and Alphana exchanged wry smiles.Even if something were to happen, the fact that Kanata had powerful individuals and authorities gathered around him was a significant advantage. Furthermore, unless it was an incredibly sophisticated surprise attack, Kanata had an impenetrable defence thanks to his infinite magical barrier.\u201cBy the way, Maria seemed a little strange this morning\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201dAlphana nodded.Kanata hadn\u2019t seen Maria today, so he didn\u2019t know, but it seemed Maria\u2019s behaviour appeared somewhat strange to Alphana.It was natural for not just Kanata and Alphana, but also Anise to be curious, and the cause of Maria\u2019s behaviour would become clear during the lunch break.\u201cI see. Well, I guess that would happen.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. But don\u2019t worry, Kanata-kun. I won\u2019t cause you any trouble.\u201dAccording to what Maria told them during the lunch break, when she returned to the castle yesterday, her parents asked her questions about the boy she had been getting along with recently.Based on her parents\u2019 and siblings\u2019 reactions, it didn\u2019t seem like they were completely convinced that Kanata was Haishin, but they were curious because he was a boy close to Princess Maria.\u201cKanata, you\u2019re so popular!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not trying to make it interesting.\u201d\u201cKyaa~\u266a\u201dKanata playfully patted Anise\u2019s back.Indeed, now that Isla\u2019s magic was undone, there was an increasing interest from those who hadn\u2019t paid attention to Kanata before. However, it appeared they hadn\u2019t directly linked it to Kanata being Haishin.\u201cBut, well, with the possibility of Haishin being in the capital now almost certain, Father and the others were quite restless. Even so, as the ruler of a country, I scolded them not to show any unseemly behaviour.\u201d\u201cFufu, that sounds like Maria.\u201dKanata chuckled as he could imagine it to some extent.Even though they had met before while he was wearing a mask, he was such a fan that he would probably tilt his head if someone called him the ruler of a country.\u201c\u2026 I am allowed to operate in the Kingdom and rely on their support for merchandise. I do want to express my gratitude properly at some point.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cAnd, of course, I\u2019ll continue to keep my face hidden.\u201d\u201cUnderstood. If that time comes, leave the preparations to us.\u201dKanata nodded in agreement.After a little more conversation, Kanata and the others bid farewell to Maria.\u201c\u2026 Muu.\u201dMaria still showed a slightly dissatisfied expression due to being the only one in a different class. It was adorable, but it was a rule that couldn\u2019t be changed no matter what.While walking with Alphana and Anise, Kanata muttered to himself.\u201cShould I take a break from streaming for a while\u2026? No, maybe it\u2019s better to continue as usual.\u201dKanata didn\u2019t know what would be the best course of action in this situation.If he took a break from streaming for a while, it would somewhat acknowledge the situation, but if he continued as usual, it might surprisingly be fine.\u201cYou should do as you like, Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. We would prefer it if you continue, though.\u201dUpon hearing their words, Kanata expressed his optimistic thoughts.*****The rumour of Haishin\u2019s presence in the kingdom spread like wildfire, both domestically and internationally.However, since no information sources had realized that Kanata was Haishin, the miracle of someone other than the fanatical worshippers noticing had yet to occur.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dBut not if you\u2019re a fanatical worshiper, of course.It\u2019s a different story when someone is fanatically devoted, as was in the Imperial Capital, the heart of the Empire, where a man with a small mustache approached a woman in the imperial palace.\u201c\u2026\u201dEven though the man spoke to her, the woman paid him no attention whatsoever.While her gaze was fixed on the capital\u2019s cityscape stretching out before her, it seemed she was looking even further into the horizon.The man didn\u2019t know what to do, but after a long silence, the woman finally spoke.\u201cThe Harvest Festival will be held in the Kingdom soon, right?\u201d\u201cYes? Ah, yes, that\u2019s correct. The event is organized by the Church led by Saint Alphana-sama.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Um, I don\u2019t mean to imply anything strange, but are you thinking something odd?\u201dThe woman\u2019s shoulders twitched.Although she had a slender figure, her well-developed body exuded an undeniable charm. With hair that evoked a vivid crimson, she turned around and continued speaking after clumsily whistling a tune.\u201cThere\u2019s no way I would be thinking something strange. What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cOh? It isn\u2019t strange to decorate the city gate with paintings of Haishin-sama?\u201d\u201cYou call that strange!? People are quite pleased with it, you know!?\u201d\u201cI understand that! But it might send the wrong message to other countries, you know!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about such nonsense! I\u2019ll deal with them!\u201d\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t take dealing with this anymore.\u201dIndeed, the identity of this woman would be revealed surprisingly soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90: Being Majestic Seems to Be the Best After All\u201cWell then, let\u2019s do it again today!\u201dWhile various speculations were spreading, Kanata decided to continue streaming as usual.As Kanata started the stream, viewers quickly gathered, and as expected, the flow of comments was predictable.: Does Haishin-sama live in the capital!?: If I go to the capital, can I meet Haishin-sama!?: Haishin-sama, please answer!: You guys, stop bothering Haishin-sama so much.: Just watch the stream quietly.: Don\u2019t you guys care?: But\u2026 you guys are bothering him.Many people asked without thinking about anything, but there were also comments that showed concern for Kanata, not inconsiderable in number.There had been similar troubles in his past life\u2026 Not that he did anything wrong, but he had watched famous people face this kind of questioning many times as a viewer.(\u2026 I think I understand now how hard it\u2019s for people to hear things they don\u2019t really want to hear.)While thinking about such things, Kanata opened his mouth without changing his usual manner.\u201cGeez, it seems there are various speculations going around about me, someone shrouded in mystery until now. But I will continue the livestream just as I have been. There may be people who are curious, but\u2026 Well, it\u2019s not like it will change anything either way.\u201dHe did not show any worries and didn\u2019t shrink back.Kanata believes that if he remains majestic, the people around him will naturally be swept along and stop caring. That\u2019s the basic idea.\u201cWell then, let\u2019s do it as usual~!!\u201dAfter that, Kanata transitioned to the usual fan mail corner.There were still many probing words about Kanata in the comments, but as time passed, the stream returned to its usual state as if nothing changed.In the end, Kanata\u2019s belief was not wrong.(Well, I understand the feeling. I\u2019ve also thought many times about wanting to meet a streamer in real life.)Although Kanata doesn\u2019t intend to become arrogant about becoming such a presence, it\u2019s still not a bad feeling to become popular.However, that\u2019s why he needs to be vigilant.For Kanata right now, the days spent as Haishin can be said to be supported by many people, including Maria, Alphana, and many other supporters.\u201c\u2026\u201dThey reached a place he alone would have never reached without the help of many allies, with Maria and Alphana at the forefront.Haishin merchandise is a prime example of that, but it should have been impossible to realize without the help of others, even if Kanata came up with the idea.\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s right. Hey, everyone.\u201d: What\u2019s up?: What\u2019s the matter?: Haishin-sama, tell us anything!: We\u2019re with you!: Who are you guys?Amidst the accelerating comments, Kanata chuckled and muttered something like this.As mentioned earlier, it was something that came to mind on the spur of the moment, and whether it could be realized or not was still uncertain.\u201cI\u2019m here, as Haishin, but just talking nonstop by myself is boring. The reason I\u2019ve been able to continue like this is all thanks to the listeners. That\u2019s why I thought it would be nice to consider a large-scale event to express my gratitude someday.\u201dAfter Kanata\u2019s sudden words, there was a momentary silence in the comments, followed by an overwhelming acceleration in the flow of comments untrackable by human eyes.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if it can actually be done. So, take it with a grain of salt and don\u2019t take it too seriously, okay?\u201dHowever, these words undoubtedly raised expectations among the listeners to some extent. Kanata mentioned a large-scale gratitude event, and while they don\u2019t know what it will be, Kanata is determined to make it happen.Being in front of a large crowd as Haishin is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, both in the past and the future.\u201cWell then, let\u2019s continue with the fan letters~!\u201dFor now, the event was put aside for another time, and Kanata began reading another letter.[Haishin-sama, excuse me!Recently, something strange happened to me, so I wanted to ask about it and decided to send this letter.You see, I\u2019m quite a well-known adventurer\u2026 but recently, I had a mysterious experience.As my companions and I ventured deeper into the dungeon, we triggered a trap. Fortunately, only I was affected by the trap.A dazzling light flashed, and for a moment, I thought I had died\u2026 but I found myself instantly transported to a strange world.]\u201cOh\u2026 a mysterious world, huh?\u201dKanata was greatly intrigued.Of course, not just Kanata, but the listeners seemed quite fascinated by the idea of hearing about someone different from themselves.[In that world, I encountered a beautiful elf.However, this elf seemed to view themselves as ugly. When I told her she was not ugly and actually very beautiful, she was surprised and started crying\u2026And then, she directed a strangely intense and terrifying gaze toward me, with a mix of passionate admiration and fear.It scared me, so I ran away.]\u201c\u2026 Heh.\u201dAs Kanata continued reading, it became apparent that the elf, who had been complimented on her beauty, underwent a drastic change that was so terrifying that the listener couldn\u2019t eat for several days.Although it\u2019s unclear what exactly happened deep within the dungeon, Kanata somehow understood what the listener had experienced.\u201cPerhaps the influence of that trap caused a momentary leap to a different world. And maybe it was a world where our concept of beauty and ugliness got reversed\u2026 or something like that?\u201d: Reversal of beauty and ugliness?: What does that mean?: I don\u2019t really get it.: This is the first time I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201cWell, you see, it refers to a world where what we consider beautiful here is called ugly there, and what we consider ugly is called beautiful.\u201dIn Kanata\u2019s past life, the concept of beauty and ugliness reversal was established as a genre, often mixed with a slightly risqu\u00e9 theme and even the reversal of moral values.Well, regarding this particular letter, Kanata didn\u2019t take it too seriously, but they wanted to convey that such a world does exist.: So, in other words\u2026 from our perspective, beautiful people are considered ugly?: People we consider ugly are called beautiful\u2026 huh?: So, beautiful people from our perspective aren\u2019t being pursued by men?: If we were to seriously tell that to someone who fits the reversed standards\u2026: Oh\u2026: Oh.It seems the listeners have arrived at the truth.Kanata, for one, enjoyed works of fiction that explored the concept of beauty and ugliness reversal. If they could go to such a world, it would surely be paradise every day.However, if one were born into that world with its value system, it would be nothing but hell. Still, it was a slightly intriguing topic for Kanata.: So, does that mean I missed out on the best moment!?: The person is here!: You idiot! You unexpectedly had a chance!: You should have just obediently accepted it!!: No way! I prefer strong men over women!: \u2026 Oh, a woman?: I\u2019m a guy, though?: \u2026: Haishin-sama, please continue.Kanata decided to stop dragging out this topic, as it was no longer as intriguing.After going from an interesting discussion to an irrelevant truth, it seemed like a perfect ending, so Kanata decided to end the stream with that.\u201cI had a great time today! Oh, and thanks for getting back to the usual atmosphere partway through. Thanks, everyone!\u201dConveying those words, Kanata finished the stream.While there was some initial anxiety before starting, it became clear after actually finishing that being confident and majestic was the right approach.Indeed, information about Haishin\u2019s whereabouts might be of interest, but what they eagerly anticipate is the time spent during the stream, no matter what.\u201cAh, streaming is really fun, after all.\u201dSmiling and satisfied, Kanata drifted off to sleep.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91: That\u2019s Just How Brothers Are\u201cHey, nice to meet you, right?\u201dA man approached Kanata and spoke to him.Kanata turned his gaze towards him, thinking it was someone else, but in an instant, he felt a strong urge to escape from there.\u201c\u2026 Hello.\u201dHis response to the sudden encounter was indifferent.Nevertheless, the man who appeared showed no sign of discomfort and continued to approach Kanata with a smile.(Why is this guy here!? And why is he approaching me!?)It was not surprising for Kanata to think that way, as the man before him was none other than Maria\u2019s brother and the prince of this country, Julius.Today was the Harvest Festival, which the people from the church, led by Alphana, had been preparing for. Kanata was also participating as a regular guest since morning\u2026 and now, a prince appeared right before his eyes.\u201cIs it safe to assume that you know who I am?\u201d\u201cWell, um\u2026 I mean, no one in this country doesn\u2019t know about you.\u201dUpon hearing that, Julius smiled refreshingly.Even Kanata couldn\u2019t help but be captivated\u2026 Though it might be an exaggeration, Julius was undoubtedly incredibly handsome.As expected of Maria\u2019s brother, Kanata thought, but as Kanata himself, he still wanted to leave this place as soon as possible.\u201cIt\u2019s Kanata-kun, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yeah.\u201dKanata understood that, fundamentally, when someone called out his name and approached him like this, they already knew about him. That\u2019s why Kanata didn\u2019t try to deceive him.\u201cEveryone, today marks the annual Harvest Festival. We have been preparing for this day, and your cooperation, gathered here, has played a significant role in making it possible. Thanks to all of you, we can celebrate this day successfully.\u201dAlphana\u2019s voice echoed through the magical voice amplification device.\u201cIt has started. This season.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Alphana worked hard for this.\u201dKnowing about Alphana\u2019s efforts through Maria, Kanata genuinely felt glad that this day could be celebrated successfully.\u201cSaint-sama~!\u201d\u201cThank you so much!!\u201d\u201cWooooh!\u201dKanata chuckled at the commotion since morning and shifted his gaze back to Julius.He was also looking at Kanata, and though it was unclear what he was thinking, one thing was certain: it had nothing to do with Haishin.It was probably about the story regarding the boy Maria mentioned that he was curious about.\u201cLet me introduce myself again. I am Julius, Maria\u2019s brother.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Kanata.\u201dKanata shook the offered hand.There was no need to be overly nervous since he knew from Maria that Julius wasn\u2019t a bad person, though Kanata couldn\u2019t deny wanting to leave this place as soon as possible.\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for me to sneak out of the castle on the day of the Harvest Festival. I happened to see you while walking as usual today. And as for how I knew your face, well, naturally, I have been keeping tabs on Maria\u2019s surroundings.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dPerhaps it was only recently that Julius had looked into Kanata, but even so, his friendly expression indicated that there was nothing negative about Kanata.\u201c\u2026 But I see. So, you\u2019re the guy Maria gets along with.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Is it inappropriate for a commoner to approach someone from the royal family?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, you don\u2019t need to worry about that. Maria is the third princess, and unless the person is someone highly untrustworthy, I don\u2019t intend to restrict her interactions.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dJulius continued, saying that even if there were restrictions, Maria wouldn\u2019t listen anyway.Kanata could imagine that since he had spent a considerable amount of time with her and shared intimate moments, Maria wouldn\u2019t comply when it came to such matters.\u201cI won\u2019t ask about the nature of the connection between you two, but it\u2019s natural to care about your cute little sister, isn\u2019t it?\u201dSaying that, Julius looked into the distance.In front of the church, a large platform was set up, and there were church members, including Alphana, who were interacting with the people.Maria, as Alphana\u2019s friend, stood by her side, holding hands with the little children and enjoying themselves.\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you today. It\u2019s strange even to myself that I\u2019ve started to take an interest in this recently, but I\u2019m glad that the boy whom Maria is close with is someone like you, Kanata.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 Thank you?\u201dJulius\u2019 behaviour was preferable as he neither asked about Haishin nor persistently probed into his relationship with Maria.While they didn\u2019t have satisfying conversations when Kanata met him wearing the Haishin mask, it seemed that the same kindness inherited by Maria was also present in her brother, Julius.\u201cJulius-sama.\u201d\u201c!?\u201dIt happened while he was having a pleasant conversation with Julius.Kanata was taken aback and shivered as he saw the face of a man dressed in knight\u2019s attire.\u201cHey, Egil, stop appearing out of nowhere without making any sound.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I apologize. However, since I found you like this, please keep your disguise to a minimum.\u201d\u201cWell, well. If I get found, it can\u2019t be helped.\u201dFrom their conversation, Kanata inferred that this man, named Egil, was probably Julius\u2019 aide or something of the sort.Despite having a striking beauty comparable to a woman\u2019s, he was undoubtedly male, as Kanata had been informed by Julius. Kanata felt a bit frustrated, thinking that if the prince was handsome, his aide would be as well.\u201cLet\u2019s head back in a little while. But before that\u2026\u201dAs if they were close friends, Julius hooked his arm around Kanata\u2019s.Kanata was surprised by the sudden action, but Julius continued speaking.\u201cKanata-kun, Maria is a good girl, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s pretty cute, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful and wonderful, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cHer chest is big, and her butt is also big, and her body is absolutely perfect, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201cYes! \u2026 Wait, what!?\u201dKanata nodded involuntarily in response to the outrageous question.Julius chuckled as if his prank had been successful, but Kanata didn\u2019t miss the shimmering radiance behind him.\u201cI question the appropriateness of such remarks towards Maria-sama.\u201d\u201cGah!?\u201dIt was a bundle of swords. Egil swiftly struck the hilt of a sword against the back of Julius\u2019 head, causing him to hold his head and crouch down.\u201cAre you\u2026 are you okay!?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Maria-sama has given me permission to do things like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSomehow, Kanata felt like he caught a glimpse of the hidden side of Julius as an older brother.Although his previous remark was undoubtedly sexual harassment, it felt like it might be more forgivable when spoken by someone as handsome as Julius.\u201cOuch\u2026 that was harsh, Egil, but it seems Kanata-kun is quite conscious of my sister. And also of Lady Alphana.\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re Maria-sama\u2019s friend, right? Please try not to trouble her too much\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, alright. Just lower your sword already. If you keep doing it, you\u2019ll look like a fool.\u201d\u201cIdiot or not, it\u2019s just for you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being cruel, Egil!!\u201dIn this almost comical exchange, Kanata became even more convinced that he was indeed Maria\u2019s brother.Afterward, Julius left with Egil, but in a sense, the encounter with him was a positive one for Kanata. It was better to leave a somewhat good impression than a bad one.\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll just casually\u2026 huh?\u201dAs Kanata was considering leisurely enjoying the festival while exploring the food stalls, he spotted Anise with a serious expression.There was also a woman walking closely with Anise, wearing a hood covering her face.\u201c\u2026 Who\u2019s that?\u201dSince the hood covered a lot, Kanata couldn\u2019t see her face.He could barely glimpse her long, flowing red hair. Despite not being able to see her face, Kanata knew she was a woman because her body lines were clearly visible, especially the ample curves that accentuated her chest.Anise and the woman walked away, but Kanata couldn\u2019t help but be curious about Anise\u2019s tense expression.\u201cI never knew Anise could make such a face\u2026 Who on earth is she?\u201dWell, such things happened, but Kanata decided to enjoy the Harvest Festival regardless.Mira, the girl who would come when called, and Kanna, whom he coincidentally met, ended up walking together with Kanata.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92: Her Name is Rosalynde\u201cAlright then, Kanata-sama, I\u2019ll go buy it real quick!\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201d\u201cBe careful, alright?\u201dIt seemed they were selling a special fruit assortment, like a parfait in words that Kanata could muster, exclusively for the Harvest Festival.Kanata was going around the festival with Mira and Kanna, but when Mira saw that dessert, her eyes lit up, and she dashed through the crowd.\u201c\u2026 Is she actually a child?\u201d\u201cUfufu, she might appear that way, but Mira-chan is a very remarkable girl.\u201dKanata nodded in agreement with Kanna\u2019s words.Mira did have the adorable flaw of being attracted to delicious things, but the power hidden within her was tremendous. If one knew everything about Mira, no one would dare underestimate her.Since she had already quit the assassination business, she now simply lives in the capital as Mira and seems genuinely happy.\u201cI\u2019ve heard about Mira-chan, but I wouldn\u2019t have believed it without your words, Kanata-kun. People can be truly deceiving based on appearances.\u201d\u201cWell, she did hide her true self well, but I agree. If someone as cute as Mira approached you like that, you\u2019d definitely let your guard down.\u201dIf a cute girl like Mira suddenly approached, one couldn\u2019t even imagine that the next moment their head would be severed.In truth, Kanata had once become a target for Mira, but only Kanata and Mira knew about that, so it remained their secret.(Well, if Mira wasn\u2019t a fan of Haishin, I would have gotten killed\u2026 I have a lot to be grateful for when it comes to Haishin.)\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s always so lively here every year.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s like a festival that comes once a year.\u201dKanata and Kanna sat in a relatively quiet place they had chosen.The people gathering in quiet places were either tired of the commotion or simply preferred such locations, so although there were many people, it was peaceful.\u201cBy the way, Kanata-kun.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt seems like you have something on your mind.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Um, why do you think that?\u201dWhen Kanata asked, Kanna smiled and said she understood.\u201cI think I\u2019ve mentioned this before, but to some extent, I can understand what men are thinking. I can\u2019t read minds, but Kanata-kun is quite easy to read right now.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dYes, Kanata did indeed have one concern.It wasn\u2019t about the Harvest Festival, nor about the encounter with Julius earlier, and certainly not about Isla, despite caring about her.\u201cWell, actually\u2026\u201dThe thing he was currently concerned about was related to ASMR.Kanata was extremely grateful to Cid for creating something so powerful that it made Isla ascend.He had various plans and intentions to do ASMR, something popular in his past life, as a streamer\u2026 However, after seeing Isla, he couldn\u2019t help but think that it might still be too early for humanity.\u201c\u2026 I mean, I might have phrased it as if we created the ultimate weapon for humanity, but still\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s true.\u201dIn fact, Kanna had heard about ASMR before through Alphana, so she imagined various things. Kanata didn\u2019t miss the slight blush on her cheeks.\u201cI\u2019ve heard it once before through Alphana-sama. Even then, it had quite an impact, but if it\u2019s even more powerful, I would love to experience it. It\u2019s a mix of curiosity and fear, though.\u201dEven if it was just a recording, it had a great effect on Alphana, and it seemed like it could impact Kanna as well.Despite being a courtesan who had entertained countless men and easily controlled her own pleasure, Kanna would probably be unable to resist the perfected form of ASMR that could render her helpless within minutes.\u201cBut wait a moment.\u201dAt that point, Kanata realized something basic.When he tried it on Isla, he neglected his basic control of magical power, the modulation of the magic wavelength he had been doing until now, due to the overwhelming excitement.In other words, he theorized that if he reduced the amount of magical power given a little, it would create a more pleasant listening experience.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of that from the beginning? But this should work.\u201dSometimes, as humans, it\u2019s important to be calm and reflect on the basics.If there\u2019s a chance to try it again, Kanata strongly felt that he should establish it as solid content to repay the assistance of Cid and Athena.\u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve sorted out your thoughts, right?\u201d\u201cYes, though there will still be some adjustments to figure out how to test it.\u201d\u201cI see. Hey, Kanata-kun, if it\u2019s alright, could I also be of some help?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Kanna-san, you?\u201dKanata crossed his arms and pondered.There wasn\u2019t much Kanna could do to assist with this matter, and the only thing she could do was help research the best way to regulate the power.In other words, it meant she would have to listen to ASMR audio for a long time.\u201cWell, it\u2019s not much, but\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dWhen Kanata explained, Kanna asserted with pride that she would help.Taken aback by her enthusiasm, Kanata instinctively took a step back. However, since it was necessary to have someone listen, he was truly grateful for her suggestion.\u201cI\u2019ll do it too!\u201d\u201cWhoa!?\u201dMira, who had somehow returned, exclaimed loudly.With her mouth stuffed full of food, she had a silly expression like a squirrel, but she still gave off a sense of alertness to her surroundings, showing her true character.\u201cThank you, Mira\u2026 But in that case, let\u2019s do it today without delay.\u201d\u201cReally!?\u201d\u201cShall we!?\u201dWhile amused by their unusual eagerness, Kanata considered going to a spacious area with the device later.\u201cIn that case, please come to my room. What about you, Mira-chan?\u201d\u201cIs it okay? In that case, I\u2019ll come and join you!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll come too!!\u201dIndeed, Kanna\u2019s private room was significantly more spacious than Kanata\u2019s, so there should be some sense of security even if something were to happen\u2026 Though what that \u2018something\u2019 might be was a question in itself.Maria and Alphana would likely be busy during the Harvest Festival today and tomorrow, so it would be difficult to invite them. It seems Mira and Kanna will be the ones to help.\u201cI really appreciate your help. You know, doing various things for the first time, I realize that relying on just myself has its limitations. It\u2019s quite apparent.\u201dBasically, only Kanata understood the principles of streaming and was the only one who knew what it entailed.Being the only one who knew meant he could only rely on himself. However, with helpers like Mira and Kanna, the scope of assistance widened, and naturally, there would be more things he could do. So, having someone to rely on was indeed important.\u201cPlease continue to rely on me, Kanata-sama!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. And don\u2019t hesitate to lean on me whenever you want. I\u2019ll make sure to comfort you again.\u201d\u201cComfort\u2026?\u201d\u201cKanna-san\u2026!\u201dNot understanding what they were referring to, Mira, and Kanna, who chuckled and shook her shoulders while laughing, left Kanata sighing wearily.It seemed like their plans after enjoying the Harvest Festival were settled.After that, Mira brought food for Kanata and Kanna, and they were enjoying it when a pair of unfamiliar individuals approached.\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cOh, someone\u2019s coming.\u201dKanata had seen the two approaching, but Kanna, who didn\u2019t recognize them, tilted her head in confusion.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Anise?\u201dThat\u2019s right, the one who approached was Anise.She was accompanied by a woman wearing a hood, whom Kanata had seen a while ago. However, Anise\u2019s demeanour today was different, and she seemed tense and nervous.\u201cH-Hello, Kanata\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, what\u2019s really going on?\u201dUnlike her usual gal-like personality, Anise appeared to be shrinking, as if she was not scared but definitely concerned about something.In such a situation, naturally, Kanata\u2019s attention would be drawn to the other woman wearing the hood.\u201c\u2026 Wait, could this presence be\u2026\u201dMira seemed to have noticed something, but the fact that she wasn\u2019t being cautious meant that it wasn\u2019t something dangerous.However, Kanata also felt it\u2014the overwhelming aura emanating from this woman, reminiscent of what he felt when facing Maria\u2019s parents.\u201cSorry, Kanata. Can I introduce her?\u201d\u201cHuh? Uh, yeah\u2026\u201dThere happened to be an inn nearby where they could have some privacy, even though they didn\u2019t plan to stay there.With Mira and Kanna also present, they stood by Kanata\u2019s side.Kanata couldn\u2019t help but suspect that this woman held a significant position, but his thoughts seemed too clear.\u201cFufufu, indeed. I finally got to meet you.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201dThe woman removed her hood, revealing long crimson hair and a sharp gaze reminiscent of Shrouza.\u201cI knew it\u2026\u201d\u201cRaven, you indeed knew about me.\u201d\u201cOf course. However, I must admit that I didn\u2019t expect you to know my true identity.\u201d\u201cIt should be obvious. It is my duty to know everything within the Empire. While you may be an assassin, I see you as a cleaner, eliminating unnecessary nuisances.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hah.\u201dThe woman shifted her gaze from Mira to Kanna.\u201cYou are beautiful. I was enamoured as a fellow woman; you are simply too beautiful. If you\u2019re willing, I would like your receive advice on skincare and such.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Well, that\u2019s fine, I suppose.\u201d\u201cI appreciate it. Beautiful courtesan.\u201dFinally, she looked at Kanata.Her sharp gaze was somewhat intimidating, but there was no hostility whatsoever.\u201cI am\u2026 I am\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe closed her eyes for a moment, then suddenly opened them wide and placed both hands on Kanata\u2019s shoulders.\u201cI am Rosalynde Xandard, the current Ruler of the Empire. To be honest, I have become a huge fan of yours. I have always wanted to meet you, so I am truly delighted to meet you today, dear Haishin. Is there anything you want me to do? I am willing to do anything for you, whether it\u2019s spending the night together or anything else you desire. I simply want to fulfill your wishes, to be needed and desired by you, dear Haishin. Please, ask me for anything\u2014\u201d\u201c\u2026 Please calm down, Rosa-sama. Kanata is feeling overwhelmed.\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201dIt seemed a rather troublesome fan had barged in, and Kanata\u2019s face showed exhaustion in various ways.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93: Is This The Emperor!?Once again, a troublesome person had arrived\u2026 Kanata sighed, but it was simply because she was speaking too fast, causing Kanata to miss the most important part.\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Do you have something to ask me!?\u201d\u201cS-So close!!\u201dAs the woman with fiery red hair approached, Kanata took a step back.Anise, with a tense expression, had inadvertently taken on the look of a troubled child. Mira, on the other hand, stared at her with a bewildered expression.\u201cHey, Kanata, did you miss the important part?\u201d\u201cThe important part?\u201dAnise slowly explained to Kanata as he tilted his head.\u201cThis person is none other than the current Emperor, Rosalynde Xandard.\u201dUpon hearing that she was the current Emperor, Kanata widened his eyes in astonishment.Though he couldn\u2019t fully grasp what was being said, when he saw Rosalynde\u2019s confident and dignified appearance, he finally understood.\u201c\u2026 The Emperor!?\u201d\u201cYes. I am the most powerful person in the Empire!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThis silence precisely reflected Kanata\u2019s current expression.Anise had briefly informed Kanata about the Empire, including through the suggestion of attending a handshake event.In Kanata\u2019s knowledge, it was natural to imagine the Emperor as a man. So the fact that the Emperor of the Empire was a woman was a significant surprise in itself.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m a bit surprised, and I have many questions, but\u2026 well\u2026\u201d\u201cCease with such formalities. Are we not close?\u201dIt seemed Rosalynde already considered herself quite close to Kanata, as her demeanour was noticeably gentle. Of course, Kanata couldn\u2019t help but wonder what she was talking about. However, Kanata had a strong intuition that Rosalynde was a forceful woman.\u201cFor now, let me explain, okay?\u201dEveryone present was curious about why such an important guest was secretly staying in the capital, not just Kanata.\u201cWell, actually\u2026\u201dTo summarize Anise\u2019s explanation that followed:She had come here because she wanted to meet Haishin, and that was her sole reason.\u201cIn the first place, I had my suspicions when Anise started studying in the Kingdom. But during the live stream when that earthquake occurred, I became almost certain. I have known about you since the early days, just like Anise. That\u2019s what it means to be a fan.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHer being a fan was a delightful thing, and having someone as influential as Maria\u2019s parents expressing interest in him was even more heartening.However, Kanata couldn\u2019t help but feel overwhelmed by the fact that the ruler of a country would go to such lengths, coming incognito like this.\u201cI always acquire what I desire. Haishin\u2026 No, let me call you Kanata. You may call me Rosa as well.\u201d\u201cY-Yes\u2026\u201dRosa slowly approached Kanata and firmly grasped his hand.The touch of her fingers, though belonging to a woman, felt slightly rough, likely evidence of having held various weapons for a long time.\u201cKanata, I want you to come and live in the Empire.\u201d\u201cEh? No way, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hou?\u201dRosa\u2019s gaze sharpened.Kanata felt the distinct pressure characteristic of people from the Empire, which he had experienced when dealing with Anise. He almost took a step back but managed to hold himself together.While he was indeed curious about the unknown Empire and had a desire to visit it someday, the idea of leaving the Kingdom and living in another country had never crossed his mind.\u201cThere are many people in the Kingdom who have taken care of me. Besides, I don\u2019t want to leave the place I\u2019ve grown so familiar with. So, I can\u2019t accept your invitation.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dTo be honest, Kanata didn\u2019t fully grasp the fact that the person in front of him was the Emperor, so he maintained a defiant posture. However, in this particular case, it seemed to work in his favour.Rosa, left dumbfounded by Kanata\u2019s response for a while, suddenly burst into laughter, causing her shoulders to shake.\u201cHahaha, to think you would refuse my invitation as the reigning Emperor. You\u2019re the first person to do so, Kanata.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about being the first or anything like that\u2026\u201dWhile Rosa had claimed to always get what she wanted, she didn\u2019t seem intent on forcing Kanata, or rather, Haishin, to ignore his own wishes.It turned out that her invitation to move to the Empire was 90% genuine and 10% a joke, as Rosa merrily explained.\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much serious, Rosa-sama\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you say something?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dRosa glared at Anise, but Anise brushed it off as if it were nothing.Despite not knowing the exact connection between Rosa, the Emperor, and Anise, the noblewoman, they seemed to have established a fairly equal relationship.\u201cWhile it\u2019s my first time meeting both of you today\u2026 What kind of relationship do you have?\u201dKanata had many questions about the prominent figure before him.In response to his inquiry, Anise and Rosa exchanged glances and simultaneously continued with the following words: \u201cBecause we\u2019re fans of Haishin.\u201d\u201cNo, that doesn\u2019t explain anything,\u201d Kanata was about to interject with a retort, but Kanna nodded understandingly.Mira, seeing this exchange, nodded in agreement, saying, \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case, then there\u2019s no helping it.\u201d Kanata, observing their reactions, once again felt a sense of disarray in this world.\u201cWell then, it\u2019s fine. We have plenty of time ahead. I plan to enjoy the Harvest Festival today and leave soon after.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Sigh.\u201d\u201cAnise, why are you letting out a sigh of relief?\u201d\u201cHuh? Anyone would feel relieved once the storm has passed.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying the same thing as one of my ministers\u2026\u201d\u201cMinister Butcher, right? That guy is also getting tossed around by Rosa-sama, isn\u2019t he?\u201dTheir conversation resembled that of close friends, and it was heartwarming to witness.Despite the considerable age difference, Rosa\u2019s appearance looked to be in her twenties, so in a sense, they even appeared like sisters.(\u2026 So this is the Emperor they speak of? It\u2019s even harder to believe now.)Rosa is said to be the strongest Emperor who quelled the civil war within the Empire through sheer force. However, it is unimaginable that the woman in front of them is the embodiment of such power.Although Kanata never vocalized his thoughts, Mira, sensing what he was thinking, whispered softly,\u201cShe may appear like this, but it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that she is unmatched in terms of raw martial and magical prowess in the Empire. Moreover, when it comes to military strategy and tactics, no one can surpass her. She is rightly feared as the Goddess of War and Military.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dKanata responded to Mira\u2019s explanation but still couldn\u2019t fathom it.The current gathering consisted of Haishin, an assassin, a high-class courtesan, the Ice Witch, and now the Emperor\u2014a truly surreal combination.If this were a story within a story, there might have been a world where they formed a party and went on adventures with this group. The thought of such a dream-like combination made Kanata sigh once again.\u201c\u2026 Sigh. Whether it\u2019s being favoured by the King or the Emperor, should I just be happy about it?\u201d\u201cYou should be pleased about that. You are also well-liked in the Principality, aren\u2019t you? In a way, you are like a bridge connecting all the nations.\u201dKanata chuckled and dismissed the notion of being such a grandiose figure.Having encountered the Emperor in this manner, Anise took the opportunity to bring up that topic.\u201cRosa-sama? It seems Kanata has something on his mind.\u201d\u201cHmm? What is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah, I see.\u201dKanata understood what Anise was getting at and thought it was a good opportunity to bring up that topic with Rosa.He explained that he wanted to plan a significant event to show his appreciation to the listeners who supported him as Haishin.Rosa responded by patting her ample chest and telling him to leave it to her.\u201cIn that case, allow me to contribute as well. We have thoroughly eliminated any troublemakers, so there should be no issues in holding a large event in the Empire. Of course, you need not worry about security. I will personally ensure your safety and never leave your side while you are in the Empire.\u201d\u201cO-Oh\u2026\u201dWhat started as a simple suggestion was turning into something much more significant.If Kanata were to say he wouldn\u2019t hold the event in the Empire, Rosa might end up in tears. Strangely enough, Kanata could foresee such a scene unfolding.\u201cIt\u2019s turning into quite a big deal\u2026 Truly, Kanata-sama!\u201d\u201cThen we, including the girls from the brothel, must attend!\u201dFrom there, things moved swiftly, and many plans were discussed.Kanata, viewing it all positively, decided to plan the event with a forward-thinking mindset.However, there was a surprise waiting for him at the end.\u201cAlright, Kanata-kun, shall we start experimenting with ASMR at my place?\u201d\u201cSure. Let\u2019s get started\u2014\u201d\u201cASMR? What\u2019s that?\u201dThe Emperor of the Empire, Rosa, was known for being unbeatable. However, that day, she experienced true surrender for the first time.\u2014This world is truly doomed.He felt like someone whispered that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94: Getting Hooked On This\u201c\u2026 This is it! Within this range!\u201d\u201cY-Yes\u2026 \u266a.\u201dThe promised ASMR experiment had given Kanata a definite sense of accomplishment.Originally, ASMR was meant to provide comfort and should not have had any strange effects on the listeners. However, Kanata\u2019s ASMR was different. It mercilessly adjusted the voice to the one that would make the listener\u2019s brain feel the most pleasure, resulting in an odd sensation.\u201cI\u2019d like to try a few more things, alright?\u201d\u201cOf course. I will always obey your wishes.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah, thank you.\u201dKanata couldn\u2019t help but think it was inappropriate for a ruler to say such things.However, in a way, it was a natural response, considering Rosa\u2019s desire to dedicate everything to Kanata. Moreover, Rosa\u2019s brain was even more intoxicated than usual, contributing to this situation.(\u2026 I understand why he wanted to experiment and verify this ASMR.)Rosa murmured in her mind.As mentioned before, the voice gets converted to one that would bring the most pleasure to the listener. For those who idolized Haishin, it transformed into a voice quality equivalent to a drug.It was a strange sensation that felt like their brains were being directly manipulated\u2014not a discomforting feeling, but one rather filled with immense joy.(How many times have I experienced it? How much have I endured?)This time, Mira, Kanna, and Anise, who accompanied Rosa in Kanata\u2019s experiment, had already taken off their earphones and fallen asleep.Their occasional trembling was likely a result of the intermittent waves of pleasure coursing through them. Amidst that, Rosa alone continued to endure to the very limit of her capacity, truly deserving the title of the War Goddess.(\u2026 But let\u2019s admit it. I have already bared everything to Kanata\u2019s voice. I must receive it, no matter what, even if it\u2019s out of pride.)Both her body and heart had succumbed to that voice.Though she still cared about the Empire to some extent, she couldn\u2019t help but focus solely on the man before her. He made her willing to offer everything and become a single woman for him.In the first place, she had harboured intense feelings for him, so it was only natural that this ASMR, accompanied by the overwhelming emotion of finally meeting him, would have such an impact.\u201cMy first defeat\u2026 Not bad, not bad at all.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Carry on.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dInitially, it was about enduring, but it seemed that Kanata had found a range where his voice could reach everyone without any issues. There was no need for restraint anymore.Kanata\u2019s voice sounded even more pleasant, and listening to it just before falling asleep gave a sense of tranquillity that could easily lull one to sleep.\u201cI feel like I could just fall asleep like this.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s part of it, after all. Although, healing power is more likely to come from a woman\u2019s voice than a man\u2019s.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dKanata chuckled, considering that aspect as well.Now, as evident from Rosa\u2019s reaction, Kanata\u2019s control over his power was working quite well.This level should be suitable for ordinary listeners as well.However\u2026 While immersed in this pleasant sensation, it\u2019s natural to think about the possibility of hearing voices in various situations. And since Rosa is also a woman, she inevitably imagined various things.(I see, so when I want to release my excitement, I can listen to this\u2026 It would undoubtedly bring me immense pleasure.)In reality, even in Kanata\u2019s past life, there were similar purposes for ASMR, so Rosa\u2019s thoughts, in a way, weren\u2019t abnormal.However, the fact that her mind went there in a world where ASMR was not yet recognized shows that she was indeed loyal to her desires.\u201cKanata, may I make one request?\u201d\u201cA request?\u201d\u201cYes. Oh, don\u2019t worry. I just want you to say a few lines that would put me at ease in a specific situation.\u201dOf course, she wasn\u2019t asking him to marry her as a thank-you for participating in the experiment. It was something related to the experiment, and Rosa believed Kanata wouldn\u2019t refuse her request, considering the combination of her desires and the context.\u201cI\u2019ve always admired the idea of childhood friends. So\u2026 if it\u2019s alright, I want you to whisper lines that evoke that kind of relationship.\u201dShe blushed as she said that, but this was another one of her gaps.Kanata initially looked surprised but then understood and nodded with a smile. He then whispered lines from a childhood friend scenario, fulfilling Rosa\u2019s request.\u25bc\u25bd\u201cI was destined for the future since the day I was born. However, I wanted someone with whom I could discuss equally.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019ve heard that Rosa-sama has always been eccentric since childhood, and no one can keep up with her.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Uhh.\u201d\u201cHuh? Why are you crying, Rosa-sama?!\u201dKanata\u2019s experiment had come together nicely.Even those knocked out by Kanata\u2019s voice at first had now recovered, and the lively atmosphere from earlier had returned.\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ah~\u201dOnly Kanata understood why Rosa shed tears in response to Anise\u2019s casual remark.It wasn\u2019t a way of thanking her for participating in the experiment but rather because Kanata showcased the whispering in the childhood friend scenario that Rosa had mentioned.The result was something that deeply moved Rosa.\u201cMira and Kanna seem alright now, right?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dKanata was surprised when he saw the two who had gone down early, but their appearance was just too suggestive, making it difficult for him to avoid looking at them.Well, it wasn\u2019t to that extent, but Kanata understood that through the adjustment of his magical power, he could provide such a pleasant sensation that it would sway their brains.(\u2026 It\u2019s like the ultimate level of enjoyment in that sense.)The original role of ASMR is to provide comfort. However, naturally, in Kanata\u2019s past life, there were many erotic themes in ASMR.In his previous life, since there was no magical power, it wasn\u2019t possible to lead people to pleasure solely through their voices. But if Kanata used his magical power without restraint or intentionally increased it, he could lightly immerse people in such situations. That\u2019s why Kanata referred to it as the ultimate level of enjoyment in that sense.\u201cFor now, we have made progress in various aspects. We just need to work with Cid to create a separate medium for storing audio and commercialize it. Then it\u2019ll be perfect.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll buy it.\u201dWhile it was possible to showcase it during regular live broadcasts, it would be embarrassing for Kanata, to the point of dying from embarrassment.Therefore, he decided to follow the approach from the past and make it available only to those who wanted to buy it.\u201cI\u2019m glad I could be of help, Kanata.\u201d\u201cLikewise. I really appreciate it.\u201dIt was quite the strange situation that the Emperor herself assisted in this collaboration, but one could say that it was all brought about by the ties Kanata had woven.Although this time marks the end of their time with Rosa, it is certain this encounter will bring about even greater challenges.\u201c\u2026 By the way, um\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dWith a slightly embarrassed demeanour, Rosa brought up something.\u201cIf there\u2019s another chance\u2026 Um, I\u2019d be grateful if you could let me hear an all-out, no-holds-barred ASMR from you.\u201dKanata quickly understood what Rosa meant by \u2018no-holds-barred, all-out ASMR.\u2019While he pondered the implications of that situation, he thought it would be fine if someone personally listened to it and enjoyed it.\u201cI see\u2026 Yeah. I might create that type someday.\u201d\u201cReally!?\u201d\u201cIs that true!?\u201d\u201cAre you serious!?\u201d\u201cFor real?\u201d\u201cY-Yeah\u2026\u201dKanata was taken aback by their enthusiasm.Well, only those who have experienced it would truly understand. But having a full-powered ASMR doesn\u2019t lead to fainting, memory loss, or being bedridden. It\u2019s not a drug or a plague. It\u2019s simply an indescribably pleasurable and blissful experience that leaves the brain and the entire body feeling incredibly good. So, there\u2019s no way one wouldn\u2019t get hooked.Remember this, humanity.This is what it means to go mad for a favourite.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95: Haishin-sama Makes An Appearance At The Harvest FestivalThe second day of the Harvest Festival arrived.For Kanata, the encounter with Rosa, the Emperor, was a big event, but it ended without any issues.After completing the experiments related to ASMR, Rosa left for the Empire with her skin strangely glowing.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to greet the King. After all, I came here secretly without others knowing about it. Isn\u2019t there a saying that says it\u2019s not a crime if you don\u2019t get caught? So, if we keep quiet, there shouldn\u2019t be any problems.\u201dRosa was truly a free-spirited person.After she was gone, Kanata let out a sigh of relief as if a storm had passed, and Anise seemed to go back home as soon as possible.\u201cShe\u2019s not a bad person, but it\u2019s really something, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s not something you see every day.\u201dIndeed, Kanata couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at Rosa\u2019s entirely unconventional behaviour as a ruler.The information about Rosa\u2019s appearance was only shared among those who met her, including Kanata. However, since Rosa wanted a place in the organization supporting Haishin, Kanata had to explain the situation to Maria and Alphana.\u201cSo she was here\u2026\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s truly something, isn\u2019t she?\u201dBoth Maria and Alphana had encountered Rosa a few times in diplomatic settings, so they were already aware of her eccentricity.Nevertheless, it was crucial not to make enemies with the Empire, and Rosa\u2019s presence was formidable.\u201cAlright, today is the final day of the festival, so let\u2019s enjoy it to the fullest.\u201dAs usual, Maria and Alphana were busy with their tasks for the Harvest Festival and weren\u2019t by Kanata\u2019s side.Even though it had only been a few days, it felt strange not having those two around, as they were usually together at the academy for the most part.\u201cIt feels lonely\u2026 Well, that\u2019s troublesome.\u201dWith Isla\u2019s magic undone, they wouldn\u2019t interact like before, which was unavoidable. But still, the feeling of loneliness grew, albeit slightly.Kanata chuckled at his own sentimentality and headed toward the town to enjoy the final day of the Harvest Festival.\u201cThere are so many people today too.\u201dJust like yesterday, there was a considerable crowd, with numerous individuals who appeared to be foreigners. Given that the Harvest Festival was a grand event in the capital, it attracted a lot of tourists.\u201cAthena and Cid wanted to come too.\u201dIt seemed that the two from the Principality also wanted to join, but at the last minute, Lisa caught a cold and couldn\u2019t participate. So they decided not to attend and let her rest.Kanata had been looking forward to seeing them again since their reunion in the Principality, but oh well, no one could blame anyone for this situation.\u201cHey, I\u2019m a customer, you know? I came all the way from far away, and you\u2019re fooling around!?\u201d\u201cDo it, boss! Knock \u2019em out!\u201dA voice of anger rang out, followed by cheering voices.Now, Kanata\u2019s gaze turned towards the commotion. It came from a particular stall among many, where a duo dressed in foreign attire seemed to be causing a ruckus.\u201cThey\u2019re idiots. There are so many soldiers around because of the Harvest Festival.\u201dKanata thought just as the overconfident duo was approached by soldiers from behind.The soldiers had a menacing appearance and imposing physiques, causing the troublemakers to scatter in fear. However, since they had caused a disturbance, they couldn\u2019t escape without consequences.They were taken away like cats grabbed by the scruffs of their necks.\u201cI knew there would be people like them, but it\u2019s a relief that they\u2019re not gathering around Maria and Alphana, who are busy with their work.\u201dIt was only natural for the security to be tight when there were both a princess and a saint present.Kanata had the urge to stay nearby and keep an eye on things, but Maria and Alphana had specifically asked him to enjoy the Harvest Festival. So, Kanata muttered while surveying the surroundings.\u201cI guess I\u2019ll go around trying various foods! I\u2019m going to fully enjoy this festival!!\u201dWith that declaration, Kanata enthusiastically began exploring the stalls.\u201cOh, what\u2019s there?\u201dAmidst all this, a peculiar event was taking place in front of the Veneti brothel, where Kanata had been greatly assisted yesterday.While the brothel was primarily a place where men sought comfort, today, both men and women were looking at something happening in front of the brothel.\u201cDance?\u201dWomen from the brothel were dancing to the accompaniment of musical instruments.They dressed in costumes resembling those worn by dancers rather than their usual revealing dresses.Though, to put it bluntly, the costumes were still quite revealing.They were performing a mesmerizing dance, and although unintentional, the high-class courtesans emitted an alluring charm that enticed men.As a result, many of the men watching them seemed to be quite excited.\u201cBut they\u2019re still maintaining their boundaries. Good for them.\u201dIt would be great if those who had caused a ruckus earlier could learn from these customers that only showed appreciation through applause.Since Kanna was among the courtesans, Kanata naturally caught her attention while watching from a fair distance.Kanna winked at him while dancing, and in response, Kanata chuckled.He waved his hand playfully, and it seemed to lighten her expression.After taking some time to admire their dance, Kanata resumed exploring the stalls.\u201cWhere should we go next?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see. What do you think?\u201dBy chance, he ran into Mira and Anise while wandering together, so they decided to spend the day together again.As the three strolled through the bustling town, they suddenly heard a loud commotion coming from a particular location.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cI wonder what it is?\u201dThe commotion was coming from the square in front of the church\u2026 in other words, where Maria and Alphana were. Kanata immediately dashed towards the noise, with Mira and Anise following closely behind.As they got closer, the commotion grew louder, and Kanata overheard what had caused the uproar.\u201cPrincess and Saint! We want to meet Haishin-sama too!\u201d\u201cYes, yes! It\u2019s unfair that only you two get to meet him!\u201d\u201cHe lives in the capital, right? Please let us meet him!\u201dIt was in a sense, something anticipated, yet at the same time, an event they didn\u2019t want to happen.Requests to meet Haishin and to have a conversation reached Maria and Alphana one after another, and it seemed as if everyone gathered in the square was echoing those sentiments.\u201c\u2026 Seriously? Those people?\u201dAnise was also visibly taken aback, right beside Kanata.Meanwhile, Mira, who had disappeared unnoticed, landed beside Kanata and explained what she had quickly figured out.\u201cThe initial commotion was caused by tourists from other countries. However, rumours about Haishin-sama have been spreading even within the capital, and it seems to have exploded in this manner.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dIt was the inevitable consequence of Haishin\u2019s previously hidden existence coming to light so blatantly, and above all, it was likely another result of Isla\u2019s magic undoing.In front of the agitated crowd, the soldiers, as well as the members of the church, including Maria and Alphana, were doing their best to calm the situation.\u201c\u2026 Please, stop.\u201d\u201cKanata\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata knew how busy Alphana had been preparing for this Harvest Festival.He knew that Maria had been fully supporting Alphana as a friend, and he had witnessed them diligently organizing and managing everything, accompanied by the joyful laughter of children.It wasn\u2019t just Maria and Alphana but many others who had worked hard for this Harvest Festival.\u201c\u2026\u201dIsla\u2019s magic coming undone was certainly one of the contributing factors.However, it was evident that the root of the current chaos lay with Kanata, and he understood that the streaming incident during the earthquake had been the decisive blow.\u201cShall I silence them all? Turning this whole area into an ice world?\u201d\u201cShall I eliminate the insolent ones?\u201dIn response to the menacing words of the two, Kanata unexpectedly felt a sense of calm.He had thought of something and made a request to Mira.\u201cMira, can you carry me to my dorm room right now?\u201d\u25bc\u25bd\u201cAh, geez! It\u2019s become such a mess!\u201d\u201c\u2026 But in a sense, it was inevitable.\u201dMaria and Alphana were desperate on the stage.The commotion had grown much larger than expected, and angry voices echoed through the air, causing nearby children to become frightened.The soldiers were also trying to calm the situation peacefully, but their efforts proved ineffective.Alphana even considered using some powerful magic to silence the crowd.(Something Anise might consider, isn\u2019t it?)No, Alphana, it\u2019s precisely what Anise would have thought of.Before Alphana could do anything, Maria seemed to have reached her limit and might have done it herself. But just as she was contemplating whether to exercise some self-control, something new occurred.\u201cCease this commotion at once.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201d\u201cThis voice\u2026!?\u201dA loud voice resounded across the square in front of the church.Its power was enough to instantly silence the tumult, and everyone closed their mouths, directing their gaze toward the source of the voice.\u201cIs that\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Kanata-sama?\u201dThere, on the roof of the church, stood three individuals.Two women, who were strikingly familiar, wore black-themed clothing, and something covered their faces.And standing between these two women was a man wearing a black robe and a mask\u2014yes, it was Kanata as Haishin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: Listeners Are The Mirror Of A Streamer(\u2026 I just came out impulsively, but the atmosphere is so tense.)Due to the rather flashy entrance, the church square, buzzing with excitement about Haishin just moments ago, fell into an eerie silence.Kanata felt completely out of place, and even though sweat was dripping under the mask, thanks to Mira and Anise standing by his side, he managed to maintain his composure.(Haha, even Maria and Alphana are incredibly surprised.)Even the girls who knew Kanata were wide-eyed with astonishment.To be honest, Kanata had come out only because he was worried about them and had no other thoughts about what to do.\u201cMira.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs Kanata called Mira\u2019s name, she replied softly and vanished into thin air.She moved to where Maria and Alphana were, ensuring their protection in an already heavily guarded location should anything happen.\u201cI\u2019m so glad. You\u2019re entrusting me with being by your side?\u201d\u201cI trust your abilities. I\u2019m counting on you.\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201dWith her eyes concealed, Anise\u2019s expression was hard to read, but Kanata could tell that her cheeks had loosened up.Kanata turned his gaze back to Maria and Alphana, giving them a firm thumbs-up.\u201cIt\u2019s Haishin-sama!!\u201d\u201cWhoaahhhh!!\u201d\u201cKyaaahhhh!\u201dFinally, it seemed like the crowd was beginning to accept the situation as they raised their voices toward Kanata.Most of those voices were undoubtedly favourable towards Kanata, but there was also a noticeable undercurrent of malice, evident in how Anise prepared to unleash her magic.(To some of the nobles, I must be an annoying presence. Even now, I occasionally receive threatening letters\u2026 But I couldn\u2019t just stand idly by.)Kanata had only one purpose: not to let anyone ruin the stage the girls had prepared with trivial matters during the Harvest Festival.Of course, with Kanata appearing as Haishin, various plans were bound to be disrupted. Nevertheless, believing that his voice could reach them, Kanata spoke up.\u201cEveryone, please quiet down.\u201dKanata\u2019s words reached them.Although he didn\u2019t raise his voice or shout, the church square fell silent in an instant.It wasn\u2019t absolute silence, but it was enough for Kanata\u2019s voice to be heard.\u201cThank you, everyone, for always listening to my streams. I\u2019m just speaking my mind, but I\u2019ve been able to continue all this time because of the listeners who look forward to my streams.\u201dFor the one streaming, having no viewers makes it rather dull. The listeners drive Kanata to continue his streams, and it\u2019s precisely because he wants them to enjoy it that he\u2019s been able to keep going.\u201c\u2026 Seriously, every day is enjoyable. No joke.\u201dThose were Kanata\u2019s heartfelt words, directed at himself and the many listeners who were probably present.\u201cHowever\u2026\u201dDespite that, something needed to be addressed seriously, and under his mask, Kanata\u2019s expression turned stern.Though this change in expression might not have been evident to others, the crowd seemed to sense that the atmosphere had shifted.\u201cBecause all of you, who enjoy my streams and are happy to see me appear, are my fans\u2026 That\u2019s precisely why I didn\u2019t want to trouble others like I am doing now.\u201dThe words likely rippled through the crowd.Still, Kanata couldn\u2019t express it too strongly, as he understood that he, as an individual, was causing the most trouble.However, it was also Haishin\u2019s duty to manage his listeners.\u201cTo me, all of you are not just fans; we spend time together during the streams, and in a sense, it\u2019s like being a family\u2026 Maybe not to the extent of being extremely close, but still, there\u2019s a certain intimacy.\u201dIn Kanata\u2019s previous world, one of the reasons people had strong feelings toward streamers was likely the sense of closeness.Unlike primarily recorded content like TV, a sense of unity arose from carefully reading the comment section.(\u2026 It\u2019s the same for me now.)Analyzing the earlier words directed at Maria and Alphana, it was evident there was some jealousy about how they had encountered Haishin, who was shrouded in mystery.\u201cListeners are like mirrors reflecting Haishin, so I take responsibility for causing all this commotion. I apologize to those who put in effort for this Harvest Festival.\u201dSaying this, Kanata bowed his head.As mentioned earlier, Kanata understood that he was involved in causing this commotion, but it wasn\u2019t him who made all the fuss; it was the people.Seeing Kanata bowing his head, it was those who made the uproar towards Maria and Alphana, feeling uncomfortable.\u201cI came out here to bring this commotion to an end. Initially, I wanted to do something like Haishin to entertain everyone, including handling the situation, but as I said earlier, this Harvest Festival is the result of the efforts of many people. That\u2019s why we should genuinely enjoy this Harvest Festival now.\u201dKanata was not an experienced adult who knew exactly what words to convey, but his words resonated deeply with the crowd.Perhaps because they usually enjoyed listening to his streams, Kanata\u2019s voice easily reached them.\u201cAlthough I can\u2019t announce it in a grand manner just yet, I plan to organize a significant event to repay all of you in the future. That\u2019s why I promise to meet all of you again at that time.\u201dKanata couldn\u2019t help but smile inwardly, thinking he sounded quite theatrical.He gestured and moved like he was giving a speech, reminding him of a character from an anime he had seen in his past life. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t be as verbose as that character, and it was frustrating.\u201cI love all of my listeners. That\u2019s why I ask you all to please refrain from causing trouble for others. You can send as many threatening messages to me as you want; I\u2019ll just laugh them off. I hope you all can help me continue to deliver enjoyable moments to everyone.\u201dAgain, Kanata bowed his head.Kanata glanced at Anise, seeing her nod and snap her fingers, causing a flurry of powdered snow to dance around him. It was a magical and enchanting moment, completely unlike the straightforward ice displays she had shown before.\u201cWell then, everyone, I\u2019ll be coming live again tonight, so make sure to tune in!!\u201dWith his voice echoing, Kanata\u2019s view suddenly changed.Kanata and Anise landed a little distance away, and soon, loud cheers reached Kanata.\u201cYou were great, Kanata.\u201d\u201cWell, it was just a simple trick. I mostly did it on a whim.\u201d\u201cEven so, I believe your voice reached them.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I hope so.\u201dTo confirm, they returned to the square, where there were now more soldiers than before. However, the commotion had subsided and had become a bit too quiet, which made Kanata smile wryly.\u201cIt\u2019s like scolding students, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIn a way, you\u2019re not wrong. In terms of being told off, that is.\u201dKanata nodded in agreement.During a break in the Harvest Festival, Kanata found the right time and approached Maria and Alphana. As soon as they saw Kanata, they quickly came over to him.\u201cThank you, Kanata-kun.\u201d\u201cThank you very much, Kanata-sama.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s my fault, to begin with. But I\u2019m glad things have calmed down.\u201dHowever, Kanata tilted his head slightly, surprised that the situation had progressed more smoothly than expected.And for some reason, he couldn\u2019t explain why, but he approached the two in front of him and embraced them with both arms.\u201cThe Harvest Festival ends today. So, just a little while longer, both of you, do your best.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cM-My ears\u2026\u201d\u201c??\u201dMaria and Alphana shivered slightly at the whispered words in their ears. Although Kanata hadn\u2019t intended it, his encouragement carried a faint magical energy\u2026 which meant Kanata had been quite earnest.\u201cWe\u2019ll do our best!!\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201dHowever, they were Maria and Alphana.Having already built up some resistance to Kanata\u2019s voice, their cheeks merely turned slightly red, and that was it.After that, the Harvest Festival continued safely until its end.\u201c\u2026 But I might not be able to go back on it now.\u201dKanata regretted a little for saying that they would do a big event.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: She Was Indeed A Goddess\u201cI\u2019m really sorry!!\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 Um, please lift your head!\u201dIsla was gracefully bowing down in front of Kanata.Several days had passed since the Harvest Festival, and Kanata was going about his daily life as usual when Isla suddenly appeared before him.Kanata had asked her to lift her head precisely because he knew why she was apologizing like this.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t bow your head so easily as a goddess! Actually, now that I\u2019ve thought about it, I should be the one thanking you, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Why?\u201dKanata explained to Isla after she raised her face.In the first place, there were aspects regarding how Kanata should interact with Maria and Alphana he hadn\u2019t considered, and the reason those things didn\u2019t become apparent was due to Isla\u2019s magic.While he was grateful for Isla\u2019s help covering the areas he should have been mindful of, he had no complaints about the magic wearing off.\u201cWell\u2026 thank you, Isla. In a way, I think this incident was actually good. Otherwise, I would have remained unaware of your concern for me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Kanataa!!\u201d\u201cMugah!?\u201dFeeling moved, Isla embraced Kanata, causing him to momentarily lose his breath. However, Isla quickly let go as if startled.Clearing her throat, Isla composed herself and continued speaking, with her tone shifted.\u201cThis time, it was my mistake\u2026 Or rather, I underestimated Kanata\u2019s power. Well, if you put it that way, it\u2019s not so bad for a goddess to ascend, right?\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201dIsla chuckled, covering her mouth with her hand, and approached Kanata again. Large wings sprouted from her back, enveloping Kanata, and her arms wrapped around his back.\u201cI\u2019m even more tempted to claim your soul now. While you\u2019re in this world, I\u2019ll entrust you to them. However, after you complete your natural lifespan, you\u2019ll stay by my side for eternity.\u201dIsla whispered into his ear.Although Kanata couldn\u2019t see her expression at that moment, her eyes were filled with immense affection and possessiveness.After that, with her magic once again active as before, Kanata\u2019s secrets remained safe from being exposed so easily.\u201cAs for the events of the Harvest Festival\u2026 should I keep them in their memories? Your appearance had quite an impact on people, positively, that is.\u201dThe incident at the Harvest Festival was being discussed among the masses in a favourable light.Some say he arrived to assist the troubled princess and the saint, while others believe he intended to admonish them, as he considers them his family.While some aspects of those stories did apply to Kanata in a way, he was mainly upset because they had tried to ruin the event by mentioning his name.\u201cWell then, Kanata, I\u2019ll take my leave now.\u201d\u201cYeah. Thank you, really.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Goodbye.\u201dIsla fluttered her wings in excitement, unable to hide her joy, and then she disappeared.Even though she was still wearing Haishin-sama\u2019s shirt as usual, the aura she exuded felt truly divine, and Kanata once again realized that she was indeed a goddess.\u201cPhew~\u201dWith Isla gone, Kanata sighed deeply and lay down on the bed.The Harvest Festival had ended, and there were no other planned major events in the capital for a while. The magic to protect Kanata\u2019s identity had been activated again, allowing him to relax and live as he did before.\u201c\u2026 But, this kind of mindset won\u2019t do.\u201dKanata shook his head, realizing that being too lax despite Isla\u2019s magic was a lesson he had learned.\u201cIt\u2019s alright to continue as before. Though my powers are involved, as the one who guided you to this world, I want you to live freely. Don\u2019t restrict yourself too much because of this incident, okay?\u201dThis was what Isla had told Kanata at some point.Perhaps Isla, who always watched over the world below, liked watching Kanata doing what he pleased: living freely.\u201c\u2026 I guess it\u2019s probably best to take it easy after all.\u201dKanata shook his head, deciding not to overthink things.Though he had time to ponder since he wasn\u2019t streaming today, he thought it might be important to continue living in the way he had been, just as Isla requested.Being cautious in moderation and enjoying life in moderation. Kanata nodded, thinking that might be the best way.\u201cAlright, for now, I\u2019ll go to sleep. Starting tomorrow, I\u2019ll be back to my usual routine!!\u201dThanks to Isla, Kanata was feeling a great sense of ease.However, he had mentioned planning a major event, which meant he would soon need to discuss it with many people and exchange opinions\u2026 But Kanata was looking forward to that as well.*****Some time passed, and significant changes occurred in Kanata and the others\u2019 daily lives.The Principality took the lead in developing a communication network. Although it could only be used by the upper echelons of the country for now, real-time communication with distant countries was established.In other words, it was somewhat like modern-day teleconferencing, but thanks to this, there was no need to write long letters anymore or rely on the tremendous magic required for one-way communication of words.Eventually, the technology was expected to spread among the people, and they were working on developing devices that would allow communication between smaller terminals.\u201cSo, it\u2019ll be like a smartphone, right?\u201d\u201cA smartphone?\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dOf course, people in this world did not know smartphones, and when Alphana, who was nearby, asked about it, Kanata shook his head, saying it was nothing.Since Isla\u2019s magic once again enveloped the world, Kanata\u2019s daily life quickly returned to normal\u2026 Well. He remained cautious in various ways, but for Maria and Alphana, it seemed like a long-awaited moment had finally arrived.\u201cMaria is busy with her duties at the castle\u2026 Fufu, so today, I have Kanata-sama all to myself \u266a.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata was currently resting his head on Alphana\u2019s lap, just like they did in the past, but the setting was a room in the church, a place Kanata often visited.As soon as their time at the academy ended, Alphana took his hand, leading him to this room where they could talk and be affectionate with each other.Not only were they indulging in each other\u2019s company, but they were also discussing their future plans together.\u201cRegarding the event in the Empire\u2026 I\u2019ve thought about it, and it might be a good idea. Normally, I\u2019d want you to reconsider, but if the Emperor is a fan of Kanata-sama, then it should be fine.\u201d\u201cIndeed,\u201d Kanata chuckled.The Emperor\u2019s strong impression itself could be considered trustworthy in a way, and Kanata didn\u2019t feel any lies in what Alphana was saying. So, when he goes to the Empire, the Emperor\u2019s support would undoubtedly be a significant advantage.\u201cIn that case, we\u2019ll need to communicate and coordinate with each other in various ways.\u201d\u201cYes, you\u2019re right\u2026 fufu.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cWell, I just thought it was a good idea after all.\u201dWhile gently stroking Kanata\u2019s head, Alphana continued speaking.\u201cSpending days like this with Kanata-sama is truly a treasure.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKanata\u2019s cheeks flushed red at the smile on her face.It wasn\u2019t like he was trying to hide anything, but after having some distance between them, he felt a sense of loneliness and a longing for their presence.What Alphana just said was something that resonated with Kanata as well, and he, too, felt her presence even more than usual.\u201cAh\u2026 Kanata-sama?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dUnconsciously, Kanata reached out and placed his hand on Alphana\u2019s cheek. Both of them seemed to be taken aback, but Alphana was the one who moved first.She leaned in closer to Kanata, lowering her face.\u201c\u2026 chu~\u201dIn a way, the time they spent slightly apart seemed to be the time they needed to take a step forward.Now, at this moment, Kanata was finally about to face the feelings stirring within him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel Inf",
