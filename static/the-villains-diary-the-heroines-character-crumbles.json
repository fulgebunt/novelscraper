Another reincarnation?Damn it, dog system!He cursed in his heart before sitting up and instructing Ding Nanrong.\u201cRong\u2019er, prepare the medicinal bath.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dAfter Ding Nanrong left, Jiang Mu called the system directly.\u201cSystem, say it, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I finish the novel\u2019s plot.\u201d\u201cWhy isn\u2019t it clear yet?\u201d\u201cI need an explanation.\u201d[Master, I\u2019m sorry.][But you, as the villain, changed the heroine\u2019s persona due to your last line before you died, causing her to fall in love with you, which in turn caused her to kill the hero.][So, the hero dies and it doesn\u2019t count as a pass for you.]Crap nigga, this shitty novel is a real dog.The female lead fell in love with me just because of my dying words?Love, love, love.I\u2019m the villain, and instead of loving the protagonist, the heroine loves the villain?And even killed the hero?What a rubbish novel.The novel is called \u201cThe Harem of the Martial Gods\u201d.The protagonist has an extraordinary destiny and endless opportunities. He collects harems, eventually becomes a Martial God, and saves the world.At the beginning, the protagonist meets the first female protagonist, Xue Menghan.Then the protagonist falls in love with Xue Menghan at first sight.Then, at Xue Menghan\u2019s birthday banquet, the protagonist stands up for her and helps her to withdraw from the marriage.And Jiang Mu, the unlucky villain who was betrayed.A conflict arises afterwards.This led to a series of subsequent stories.The protagonist of the novel is called Ling Aotian, who likes to hide his strength and is also able to fight monsters over the levels.It is commonly known as pretending to be a pig and eating a tiger, pretending to beat his face or something.What is more disgusting to readers is that until the ending, the protagonist has not even touched the hands of the female protagonists.Anyway, it is, a trashy harem.\u201cSystem, I\u2019ve been reincarnated dozens of times, I\u2019m about to get mental illness, I really don\u2019t want to continue.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give me a golden finger, in exchange for the price, I\u2019ll change this reincarnation to the last one.\u201d[Allow the system to do the calculation.]\u201cDon\u2019t do the calculation.\u201d\u201cDo you want me to kneel down like a dog and lick that heroine for dozens more rounds.\u201d\u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like to lick a woman on your knees?\u201d\u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like to be punched in the face?\u201d\u201cDo you know?\u201d[In that case, the system will give you a golden finger: a diary.]\u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d[The host only needs to write a diary related to the plot every day to be rewarded.][After passing the level, the host can return to the real world with the reward and also choose a character from the novel.][Warm reminder: Since the host has obtained the Golden Finger, this will be the last of the hundred reincarnation opportunities.][Wish you a smooth passage, goodbye.]Do I get a reward for writing a plot-related diary?Seems pretty good.Jiang Mu walked to the table and sat down.With a thought of his mind, he tried to enable Golden Finger.Immediately afterwards, a diary appeared in front of him.It was quite convenient.Fingers flicked over the book.Let\u2019s try to start writing in the diary.[March 5th, sunny.][I\u2019m very angry now.][It\u2019s been more than seventy rounds, and the dog system keeps finding all kinds of excuses not to let me pass. It\u2019s doing it on purpose, right?][But luckily, I\u2019m also familiar with the plot, so even if this is the last round, I\u2019m still 100% sure that I\u2019ll get through it, and now I\u2019ve made a profit by taking advantage of the dog system\u2019s golden fingers.][By the way, the first main plot, what was it? Oh, I remember.][I\u2019m going to go through a main storyline tonight, probably, at Xue Menghan\u2019s birthday party, and I get dumped by her and break my engagement.][Who likes Xue Menghan? She\u2019s a brat and a rebel. What\u2019s left of her besides her money and beauty and the fact that her father is the city lord? What else is she? I wouldn\u2019t want her for nothing.][As the head of the Wuyou Sect, I am a powerful man, handsome and rich. What kind of woman do I want? Do I have to lick her? Isn\u2019t Ding Nanrong, who has a great body, better than her?][People in this world are all stupid.][Speaking of Ding Nanrong, she\u2019s my personal maid, powerful, beautiful, and with a great body.][But her hair is so casual and the clothes she wears are so ugly.][She always wears a loose purple gown with trousers underneath, and her embroidered shoes are so old-fashioned that they don\u2019t show anything, making herself look like a sagging purple eggplant.][The actual Ugly Explosive Ugly Explosive Ugly Explosive \u2026]After writing a lot, Jiang Mu felt a few hundred pounds lighter.It seems that writing a diary is good for the body and mind, how come I didn\u2019t realize it before.Jiang Mu closed his diary.With a thought, the diary disappeared.With another thought, the diary appeared again.\u201cNot bad, the golden fingers sent by the dog system, it\u2019s quite user-friendly.\u201dAnd at this moment, what Jiang Mu didn\u2019t know was that the diary he had just written was copied into many copies and appeared in front of many women.\u2013The bathhouse.The heat was steaming and the fragrance of medicine was wafting.Ding Nanrong threw the last of the elixirs, into the bath.When preparing to call Jiang Mu for a medicinal bath, a diary vapor suddenly appeared in front of her eyes.\u201cWho!\u201dThinking there was an enemy attack, she immediately let out a powerful burst of spiritual energy. An invisible aura wrapped around her body, and her loose purple robe dress floated without wind.Like a fat purple eggplant.After a long moment of vigilance, she withdrew her breath only after confirming that there was no danger.A brief glance at the diary in front of her.\u201cThe Private Diary of Jiang Mu?\u201dCurious, she flipped it open and read.\u201cWithdrawn, and \u2026.

Satisfied. She began to analyze it.\u201cThe appearance of this diary looks like a spatial spirit art.\u201d\u201cBut the Patriarch is only a Spirit Gathering Realm cultivator, he doesn\u2019t know any spatial spirit arts at all.\u201d\u201cSo, this diary, how was it transmitted to me to read?\u201dDing Nanrong was puzzled.She tried to make a mental movement, and the diary surprisingly disappeared.When she thought again, the diary appeared again.How strange!She really couldn\u2019t understand the source of it, so she decided to ask for clarification directly.When preparing to go and call Jiang Mu, she subconsciously looked at her own purple robe and dress.The purple robe dress had become fluffy under the support of those few pounds of style.Was it really ugly?After hesitating for a moment, she slowly took it off \u2026.[Temperament +1][Face value +1][The reward: the body of pretending to be beaten][Reward Description: Master has always pretended to be a pussy and has never been killed. When attacked, cancel 50% of the damage.]After the system voice.Jiang Mu then felt that his body, was imbued with a mysterious power.Clearly, the body had been strengthened.\u201cCancel 50% damage?\u201d\u201cHolycrap!\u201dJiang Mu was so happy that he almost jumped up.In this metaphysical world, he had lived until almost the end before he died.As a villain, he was either pretending to be beaten or on his way to being beaten.And now, with a body that could cancel out 50% of the damage, there was no fear of being beaten or crying.Very good, very strong.And in future, there is no need for a medicinal bath to quench the body.This not only saves a lot of personal time.It also saved the Wuyou Sect a large amount of spiritual medicine.Jiang Mu\u2019s identity was that of the head of the Wuyou Sect.Three years ago, his father and mother had led 90% of the disciples of the Wuyou Sect to the Demon Beast Mountain Range to stop the invasion of the monsters.As a result, only the father and mother survived, while the rest of them were all wiped out.It was only a year ago that both parents passed away due to serious injuries.So.Jiang Mu, as a matter of course, succeeded his father as the Patriarch of the Wuyou Sect.However, he was used to being lazy and arrogant, and did not know how to develop the sect. So as a result, the disciples ran away every day, and the sect became more and more decayed.Moreover, it was thanks to the protection of a powerful personal attendant, Ding Nanrong, by his side.Otherwise, he, who was nothing but handsome, would have been killed by some scheming people.While Jiang Mu was lamenting about his life.The door to the room was opened.\u201cPatriarch, the medicinal bath is ready, please move to the bath room.\u201dAt the doorway, Ding Nanrong stood silently.She was dressed in a completely different look than before.She wore a jellyfish hairstyle with two braids. A short purple bustier dress, and her old-fashioned embroidered shoes had been replaced with amethyst sandals.The creamy white skin, the excessive curves, and the long sexy legs were all on display and enticing to the extreme.\u201cCrap!\u201dJiang Mu\u2019s eyes went wide as he watched, almost spurting out a nosebleed.But more than that, his scalp tingled with panic.Having been reincarnated seventy times himself, he had long since figured out Ding Nanrong\u2019s persona to a large extent.Even the number of hairs on her body could be counted.According to Ding Nanrong\u2019s persona, even if she were to be killed, she would never dress like this!Could it be that.Ding Nanrong\u2019s persona \u2026. distorted?But don\u2019t!If the persona is distorted, the plot will be distorted too!I\u2019ve only got one last round left!\u201cRong\u2019er, you\u2019re not sick, are you? No, are you all right?\u201d\u201cNot sick, Patriarch, do I look good?.\u201dDing Nanrong walked towards Jiang Mu, her shoes moving, her skirt fluttering, her wave pack gently surging.\u201d Looking good \u2026. Good looking my ass! It\u2019s ugly, go back to your room and change, hurry up!\u201dAt this moment, Jiang Mu\u2019s expression, like constipation for dozens of days, was held in a twisted way.He knew that the aloof Ding Nanrong, who was ruthless and didn\u2019t talk much, never paid much attention to the outside, much less took the initiative to ask herself if she looked good.Had it affected her persona because he had been reincarnated too many times?It couldn\u2019t be!Ding Nanrong didn\u2019t listen to Jiang Mu\u2019s words.With a flash, she moved behind Jiang Mu.Jiang Mu only felt the fragrant breeze on his nose. His body was light, and his whole body was carried by her as he flew out of the room and arrived at the bathhouse in three or two steps.\u201d Patriarch, Today \u2026\u2026\u201dDing Nanrong just wanted to open her mouth and ask directly.How was the diary transmitted to her to see? Why did you say bad things about her? Did it want to die?The result was that she couldn\u2019t open her mouth at all!It was as if there was an invisible force that had nullified her own voice!She tried several more times, but the result was the same!Unable to figure out why this was happening, she scornfully reasoned.This, the power of the heavens!As the saying goes, heaven\u2019s power must not be revealed.So, she did not dare to probe further.\u201cPatriarch, I will come back in the evening and take you to Miss Xuemeng Han\u2019s birthday banquet.\u201dAfter saying that, she turned and left, leaving Jiang Mu with a sexy and seductive back.\u201cOkay.\u201dJiang Mu was a little confused.Although Ding Nanrong wasn\u2019t right, at least the plot wasn\u2019t crooked now.He himself was following the original plot, taking a medicinal bath to toughen up his flesh and waiting for the evening\u2019s withdrawal to get punched in the face.Jiang Mu stripped naked and jumped into the medicinal bath.Summoning his diary, he wrote something random.[Crap, scared the hell out of dad just now.][Ding Nanrong, the old virgin, is in heat, right?][Suddenly dressed in such a sexy way, is she trying to seduce me? but don\u2019t, this is a broken novel world. I only have one last reincarnation. I must not screw up the plot!][Thank you in advance.]\u2013In Ding Nanrong\u2019s bedroom.She had changed back into a loose purple robe and dress, as she was not used to showing her shoulders and legs at all.Suddenly, she felt something in her heart.So she summoned her diary.When she saw the updated contents, her whole body was struck by lightning.Reincarnation?This was a fictional world?How could it be!Ding Nanrong thought Jiang Mu was crazy. He must not be able to accept the death of his parents and the decline of his sect.And the contents of the diary that followed.It completely shattered her three views!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I'm Good at It[Alas, Ding Nanrong\u2019s persona is actually even worse than mine.][When she was very young, she awakened the \u2018Innate Yuan Body\u2019, which is a very rare cultivation physique, and was later discovered by the Patriarch of a small sect.][So that Patriarch, had the desire to own her and wanted to use her, so he secretly killed her entire family and took her captive.]Ding Nanrong: \u201c!!!\u201d[When she was 12 years old and in bud, the sect master was ready to take her, but she escaped, and later, she came back and destroyed the small sect herself.][After her revenge, she tried to kill herself because she had lost her family and she couldn\u2019t find a meaning to live.][The only thing that kept her alive now was to stay by my side, to watch the complete decline and destruction of my Wuyou Sect, and then finally kill me with her own hands.]Ding Nanrong: \u201c!\u201d[Her reason is also bullshit enough, just because the Patriarch of that small sect was my far, far, far cousin, so she decided that my Wuyou Sect was to blame. That\u2019s why she is willing to become my personal maid, protecting the wasteful me while watching how I mess up the Wuyou Sect].How did he know that!!!I never\u2026 Never told anyone about it!!!Ding Nanrong\u2019s three senses were shattered to the ground.The demise of that small sect, no one even knew it was her doing.And she had indeed thought about killing herself.Now staying by Jiang Mu\u2019s side and watching the slow destruction of the Wuyou Sect was indeed the only meaning of her life.All these secrets, surprisingly, Jiang Mu knew everything!Could it be that \u2026. Is it really, as he said, this is just a \u2026. fictional world?My destiny \u2026. has been arranged as well?Ding Nanrong was so shocked that she could not calm down for a long time.Half hour later.Only then did she slowly adjust.She put down her diary and went to the window, looking out at the white clouds of fluttering cranes beneath the cliff, their songs clear and loud.The cliff breeze caresses her beautiful face. Her fragrant skirt hair flutters in the wind, and her skin still feels a slight tingle of coolness.The reality of these senses let her know.In this world, she, Ding Nanrong, was real.No matter what.Her purpose would not change just because Jiang Mu knew about it.Also, it was obvious.Jiang Mu was unaware that his diary had been peeked at.This seems quite \u2026. Interesting?Regarding Jiang Mu\u2019s diary, Ding Nanrong became extremely interested.This was the first time she had become interested in things after her revenge.There was a pleasure in peeking into other people\u2019s privacy.Only, now, the more she thought about it, the more unpleasant it was.\u201cOld maid huh?\u201d\u201cHorny, right?!\u201dShe looked down at the purple gown that was hanging loose.And then, ripped it hard.***The time came at night.In the bathhouse.It had been a day since the medicinal bath, yet Jiang Mu felt little effect.It wasn\u2019t because the elixirs were bad. On the contrary, they were all of the highest grade in the Wuyou Sect.The real reason was.His body.It had already been strengthened by the \u2018body of pretending to take a beating\u2019.\u201cIt feels like, right now, I\u2019m very capable of taking a beating.\u201d\u201cEven if I were as strong as Ding Nanrong, I would still be able to leave a whole corpse under her full force strike.\u201dPutting on the jade white handsome suzerain robe, Jiang Mu opened his diary.Writing up.[I\u2019ll have to do a performance of being rejected later. I\u2019m good at it.][This time, what kind of lines should I say? And what kind of expression should I use?I\u2019m not sure how I can live without you.][Or should I say bitterly: \u201cThe farthest distance in life is not life and death, but the fact that I am standing in front of you and you don\u2019t know that I love you.\u201d][Or indignantly: \u201cThirty years in the east, thirty years in the west, don\u2019t bully the poor.\u201d][Wow, \u00a0I guess, I\u2019m genuine after all.]After writing.The system\u2019s voice rang out.[Ding, congratulations to the shrinking master, successful diary writing.][Temperament +1][Face Value +1]There was no other reward this time. Only a bit of temperament and face value was added.\u201cReward\u2019s are good for just writing diary first day, right?\u201dJiang Mu didn\u2019t quite understand this reward pattern.But it didn\u2019t matter. The diary, just write it. The rewards that should be there wouldn\u2019t run away.\u2013Xue City.City Lord\u2019s Mansion, back courtyard flower courtyard.\u201cMiss, slave servant really can\u2019t see anything.\u201d\u201cForget it then, you can leave.\u201dXue Menghan told the servant girl to retire.Looking at the Private Diary of Jiang Mu in her hand, she felt surreal.This diary, only she could actually see and touch it!And when she wanted to tell the servant girl the relevant information from the diary.She found that she could not open her mouth at all!Even when she wrote with a pen, she couldn\u2019t write at all!It was as if there was an invisible force that had blocked all the information in the diary!After thinking about it, she couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on.In the end, she could only scrupulously think that it was the power of the Heavens.And after seeing the contents about herself, she was really shocked to the core.\u201cThe retreat was decided only today, I never told anyone about it, how did Jiang Mu know about it!\u201d\u201cCould it be, is this really the world of fiction?\u201d\u201cThe farthest distance in life \u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bully the youth \u2026.\u201dWhen she saw these words, Xue Menghan\u2019s heart, it was as if something had touched her.I didn\u2019t expect that this dude, who was engaged to her, could actually write such philosophical words.It was this lady who had lost her eyes.At this time, the diary was updated again.[The male protagonist, Ling Aotian, should be in the City Lord\u2019s residence now.][Pfft hahahahaha, come to think of it.][Xue Menghan was sulking because she was unhappy with her engagement to me, and Ling Aotian happened to be passing by the courtyard, so he went up to appease her and said, \u201cMenghan, although you\u2019re cute when you\u2019re angry, you\u2019re the most beautiful when you\u2019re smiling.\u201d][Then, Xue Menghan, the silly dog, felt that Ling Aotian was so handsome and gentle, and she instantly blushed.][Before Ling Aotian left, he even smiled wickedly: \u201cYour smile, I will guard it.\u201d The result was that Xue Menghan, a silly dog, became obsessed and fell in love with him on the spot.[yuee, so greasy and sloppy, maybe this is love.]???You\u2019re the silly dog. You\u2019re the nymphomaniac!Xue Menghan was furious.It was not enough to call her a rebel, but now she was being called a dumb dog and a nymphomaniac?As the number one beauty in Xue City, how could I be so smitten by just one or two words?Who is he looking down on?She kicked the diary away in hatred.With a beautiful trajectory, the diary landed on a young man in black robes who was passing by, and disappeared after passing through.The black-robed youth was completely invisible to the diary and was walking towards Xue Menghan.He had a handsome face, an upright figure, a calm gait and a heroic air.What drew the most attention were the deep eyes of his that seemed to shoot out evil light.Ling Aotian!The male protagonist in The Harem of the Martial Gods, with an extraordinary destiny, endless opportunities and a countless harem!\u201cYoung Master Ling? Is there something wrong?\u201dXue Menghan puffed out her face and tried to keep her anger down.To be honest, for the handsome, confident and strong Ling Aotian, Xue Meng Han did not hate him.Plus, when she was in trouble in the Demon Beast Mountain Range before, it was Ling Aotian who helped her, and she had developed some good feelings because of that.Only to see Ling Aotian coming in front of Xue Meng Han, looking at her puffy face, he said in a gentle voice.\u201cMeng Han, although you are cute when you are angry, you are the most beautiful when you smile.\u201dXue Menghan: \u201c!!!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m here to be beaten up and get bailed out of marriage!Jiang Mu walked towards Xue Menghan with great enthusiasm.As soon as they saw Jiang Mu, all the guests in the hall stopped talking and hurriedly focused all their attention on him.Their gazes were still tinged with respect and awe.The Wuyou Sect, which once had tens of thousands of disciples, was powerful and revered.It had also once been the dominant sect in this southern realm, managing many small sects and large cities like Xue City.However, now that it has declined and fallen into decay, with only a few hundred disciples left, its overall strength today is far less than before.But the thin camel was bigger than the horse.In Xue City, Jiang Mu\u2019s status was still the highest.Xue Menghan\u2019s father, the city lord Xue Yuanshan, was all smiles as he greeted Jiang Mu with all sorts of pleasantries and greetings.Jiang Mu casually exchanged a few pleasantries with him before arriving in front of Xue Menghan.He, for one, was about to start the show!\u201cMenghan, it\u2019s been a long time, you\u2019ve become beautiful again, I have grown to love you more and more!\u201dWhile speaking excitedly, he gestured for Ding Nanrong to take out a gift.Ding Nanrong took out dozens of large, exquisite boxes from her ring.After opening the boxes, she retreated to the side and silently looked at the scene in front of her.\u2013This should be what the Patriarch was talking about. The marriage withdrawal plot, right?Quite curious.Jiang Mu waved his big hand and pointed to the pile of exquisite boxes with great bravado.\u201cMenghan! These are gifts for you, wishing you a happy sixteenth birth anniversary, eternal youth and a thousand miles of cultivation!\u201dInside the boxes, there were all kinds of spiritual pills, martial arts techniques, demon cores and spiritual weapons, and so on.Such a huge gesture left the guests present in awe.\u201cPatriarch Jiang is so atmospheric!\u201d\u201cPatriarch Jiang and Miss Xue are a match made in heaven!\u201d\u201cCongratulations to Lord Xue for finding such a worthy son-in-law as Patriarch Jiang!\u201d\u201d Patriarch Jiang, I have four daughters!\u201d\u201d Patriarch Jiang, my in-laws will be crying crows \u2026.\u201d\u201c\u201d\u2026\u201d\u201dListening to the compliments of the people around him.Jiang Mu clasped his hands to his chest and held his head high.A look of \u2018old me is very bullying\u2019.Looking at Jiang Mu in front of her, Xue Menghan revealed a smile that was not rude:.\u201cThank you, Patriarch Jiang.\u201dThis official fake smile, this calm and emotionless tone of voice, made Jiang Mu almost laugh inside his heart.Sure enough, this was the heroine.Even when faced with an annoying villain, she didn\u2019t lose her manners.But how is this enough, you still have to withdraw your marriage to me.\u201cMenghan, today you turn sixteen and become an adult, let\u2019s choose a date to get married, I can\u2019t wait, I\u2019ll treat you well!\u201dThe words were spoken with such emotion and urgency, full of love, that Jiang Mu couldn\u2019t help but give himself some praise.I\u2019m such a little movie star.Xue Menghan just smiled and quietly watched his performance.Hmph, this Jiang, who said in his diary that he didn\u2019t like me and slandered me as a silly dog and nymphomaniac, is now acting so genuinely affectionate.Withdrawal drama, right?Very well.I\u2019d like to see how you can act if I don\u2019t withdraw my marriage today!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He came just in time.Although he didn\u2019t know what Xue Menghan had gotten into and didn\u2019t follow the original plot.But the male lead, Ling Aotian, was in place.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Jiang Mu instantly entered the scene and questioned him with narrowed eyes.\u201cMy name is Ling Aotian!\u201d Ling Aotian took a step forward, his aura not falling.Jiang Mu folded his arms around his chest and pointed his nostrils at him.\u201cLing Aotian?\u201cWhere\u2019s the hick from.\u201d\u201cOh, come to think of it.\u201d\u201cA few days ago, Menghan was in the Demon Beast Mountain Range and met a black-robed youth.\u201d\u201cI think his name was Ling What\u2019s-His-Name Tian.\u201d\u201d So you\u2019re fucking called Ling Aotian?\u201dThe tone of his voice was contemptuous and arrogant.A look of complete disdain for the other party.\u201d That\u2019s just old me, how about that?\u201d Ling Aotian coldly said back.Jiang Mu pointed at him fiercely, \u201cMenghan is this Patriarch\u2019s fiancee! You country bumpkin dare to come near her, this Patriarch will make you regret being born in the world!\u201dLing Aotian snorted, \u201cFiancee? Have you asked if Menghan has agreed to marry you? That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dJiang Mu said angrily, \u201d Who are you to say whether she agrees to marry our sect or not?\u201dLing Aotian continued to snicker, \u201cMeng Han is Laozi\u2019s woman, who do you think Laozi is?\u201d\u201cF***ing looking for death!!!\u201dJiang Mu was furious on the spot, his eyes glaring as if they were about to burst into flames.Ling Aotian narrowed his eyes and stared at the furious Jiang Mu as he sneered evilly and said.\u201cA mere fop Patriarch of a down-and-out sect.\u201d\u201cThe cultivation level is only at the Spirit Gathering Realm as well, and you even raised it up by getting high on pills.\u201d\u201cHow can a loser like you give happiness to Menghan?\u201d\u201cToday, you will withdraw from the marriage for Menghan!\u201d\u201cOnly I, Ling Aotian, can give Menghan everything she wants!\u201d\u201cAnd you, Jiang Mu, are not worthy!\u201dAfter saying that, he took up a fighting stance and pointed a crooked finger at Jiang Mu.The provocative intent was obvious.\u201cAhhhhhh this sect wants you dead!!!\u201dJiang Mu roared, like a madman who had lost his mind, and pounced madly on Ling Aotian.Ling Aotian did not show any weakness and mobilized his spiritual energy to meet him head on.Boom, boom, boom!Both sides raised their fists and attacked fiercely, barely defending themselves, their fists hitting the ground.When the crowd saw this, they began to share their thoughts.Some said that they should make peace and should go and stop them.Some ate the melon and watched with amusement.Others admired the battle between the two, pointing and gesturing.It is well known that the cultivation realm of the Cang Ling Realm is dominated by martial arts, and there are six cultivation realms.The Spirit Gathering Realm, the Qi Sea Realm, the Returning Origin Realm, the Void Refining Realm, the Empty Meditation Realm and the Martial God Realm.They could see that.Ling Aotian\u2019s cultivation realm was the same as Jiang Mu\u2019s, both at the Spirit Gathering Realm.Only, Jiang Mu was a notoriously straw Patriarch.His entire Spirit Gathering Realm cultivation level was all from getting high on pills, and he couldn\u2019t even beat an ordinary Spirit Gathering Realm cultivator.He was very weak.Ling Aotian, on the other hand, was different.The power he displayed at the Gathering Spirit realm was even vaguely at the Qi Sea realm!So.There was no suspense in this match-up.It was definitely Ling Aotian who had finished off Jiang\u2026.. Eh?What the hell!The crowd noticed that something was wrong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m going to be forced to use my master\u2019s power?Ling Aotian\u2019s thoughts came to life.Jiang Mu, however, felt very depressed.Damn, has this male protagonist not eaten, why are his fists soft?In the original plot, I was beaten up and vomited blood by him in three or two blows and couldn\u2019t get out of bed for a few days.But what is this?As his mind wandered, Jiang Mu gradually came to understand.It wasn\u2019t that his opponent hadn\u2019t eaten, but that his own body, which had been strengthened by the \u2018Body of Pretending to Take a Beating\u2019, would automatically cancel out 50% of the damage.Therefore, unless Ling Aotian went on a rampage and used the power of his master.Otherwise, he would not be able to inflict significant damage on himself at all.Since this was the case \u2026.\u201cAh\u2026!\u201dAfter receiving a punch, Jiang Mu let out a miserable cry of \u2018pain\u2019.At the same time, he quickly bounced back and threw himself backwards viciously.to create the effect of being punched and sent flying by Ling Aotian.When the crowd saw this, some of them exclaimed in shock. Some were delighted, while others, were confused.This was especially true of City Lord Xue Yuanshan.As a cultivator of the Returned Origin realm, he was the most powerful figure in Xue City, and he could see at a glance that Jiang Mu had done it on purpose.So he waited and watched to see what Jiang Mu was planning to do.Jiang Mu\u2019s whole body flew back out and landed right in Ding Nanrong\u2019s arms, where she caught him steadily.Fragrant, the softness.Although he wanted to enjoy the two waves, he had to put the plot first.Getting down from Ding Nanrong\u2019s arms, Jiang Mu pointed at Ling Aotian with a grim face and sternly yelled.\u201cRong\u2019er kill him for this Patriarch! This sect wants him dead!Cough\u2026 Ka *vomit*!\u201dSaying that, he covered his abdomen and deliberately spat out a mouthful of blood.It looked as if it was badly injured.Ding Nanrong was indifferent and only gave him a cold look: Good acting.In fact, Ding Nanrong was not weaker than Xue Yuanshan, so naturally she could see that Jiang Mu had done it on purpose.Plus, she had already read the diary and knew that Jiang Mu was acting in order to complete the withdrawal plot.So, from the beginning to the end, she was eating the melons.At this point.Xue Menghan, who had already replied, hurriedly spoke up to stop it, saying.\u201cPatriarch Jiang, don\u2019t fight, this is all a misunderstanding.\u201d\u201cMisunderstanding? This Patriarch is beaten to the point of vomiting blood by this hick, and you call this a misunderstanding?\u201dJiang Mu stared at Ling Aotian with resentment, then turned his head to look at Xue Menghan and questioned him in a stern voice.\u201cMenghan! Is it because of Ling Aotian that you have never agreed to marry me? Do you like him?!\u201d\u201cAh? No, I don\u2019t, don\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201dXue Menghan was dumbfounded by the question and hastily denied it.At first, she admitted that she had a bit of a crush on Ling Aotian, but it was still far from her liking.Especially now, since she knew the contents of the diary, somehow a sense of rebellion rose up within her.She disliked that feeling of being set up by fate.\u201cNo? How could he say you were his woman if you didn\u2019t like him! And how could he stand up for you and withdraw my marriage!\u201dJiang Mu still pressed in a stern voice.\u201cI really didn\u2019t!\u201dXue Menghan was so angry that she was on the verge of tears.She had only known Ling Aotian for a few days and hadn\u2019t even talked much.How come she had become his woman!Bullshit!Right then, Ling Aotian came in front of Xue Menghan, and looking at her angry and crying look, he said in a warm voice.\u201cMenghan, don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let you marry someone that, you don\u2019t like at all.\u201dThen he turned to face Jiang Mu, his gaze sharp and his tone suddenly cold.\u201cYour Wuyou Sect, being a famous sect, has a reputation that resonates throughout the entire Region of Li.\u201cEven after losing its position as the dominant sect in the southern border of Li Zhou, it has never lost the respect of the world.\u201d\u201cYet!\u201d\u201cAs the head of a sect, you, on the strength of a marriage certificate, engaged in moral kidnapping and forced a young maiden in her prime, who didn\u2019t even like you, to marry you!\u201d\u201cWhat kind of man are you?!\u201d\u201cNowadays, the situation between the human race and the demon race is dire, and there is the possibility of war at any time!\u201d\u201cAnd Xue City, as the front line in the fight against the demon beast mountain range, is, at all times, facing invasion from the demon race!\u201d\u201cAnd yet you don\u2019t think ahead, instead of properly reviving your Wuyou Sect and putting your heart and soul into defending against the demon race, you indulge in childish love?\u201d\u201cAnd what kind of Patriarch are you?\u201d\u201cHave you forgotten the battle in the Demon Beast Mountain Range three years ago!\u201d\u201cHave you done right by your parents!\u201d\u201cAre you worthy of the 9,000 lives of the Wuyou Sect?\u201d\u201cAnd can you stand up to the cultivators who sacrificed their lives to fight against the demon army in the entire Southern Realm!\u201d\u201cAre you still a human being !!!!!!\u201dWow\u2013!!!Ling Aotian\u2019s barrage of words was like a boulder hitting the surface of a lake, setting off an uproar and causing the entire crowd to gasp in awe.Even Lord Xue City was filled with appreciation as he looked at Ling Aotian.I never thought that apart from his strength, this child would also be so sharp in his thinking.This Ling Aotian is extraordinary!Alas, it was a pity that Menghan had a marriage engagement with Patriarch Jiang.If not, Menghan and Ling Aotian\u2026 It would have worked out.Xue Yuanshan looked at the righteous Ling Aotian, and then at Jiang Mu, who was in a mess and spitting blood.Helplessly, he shook his head in secret regret.\u201cCough cough pfft!\u201dJiang Mu was so shocked by the words that he spat blood again, seemingly having been suffering from a bad \u2018stimulus\u2019.He pointed a trembling finger at Xue Menghan, showing his teeth and jaws. The anger in his gaze was like a volcano erupting.\u201cSo that\u2019s it! I see, it was you yourself, Menghan, who wanted to withdraw from the marriage!\u201d\u201cYou pushed Ling Aotian out so that he could be used as your shield, so that i would withdraw from the marriage for you!\u201d\u201cGood! How wonderful! I was so devoted to you in vain \u2026. Cough cough pfft!\u201dSaid the man, spitting out another mouthful of blood.Damn, Laozi is really fighting.These few mouthfuls of blood, how many meals must be eaten to make up for it.But it couldn\u2019t be helped. This retreat plot was the main plot and had to be guaranteed 100% completion.Jiang Mu\u2019s words made Xue Menghan feel aggrieved.It was true that she wanted to withdraw from the marriage.But she had never thought that she needed to rely on a man to withdraw her marriage for her!\u201cPatriarch Jiang, it\u2019s not what you said, I did want to withdraw from the marriage, but I \u2026.\u201dBefore she could finish her sentence, she was interrupted by Jiang Mu tearing her heart out:.\u201cWhat! So you really do want to withdraw from the marriage!\u201d\u201d Menghan! I have always loved you and only you since I was a child!\u201d\u201cDo you know how many sects\u2019 proud daughters want to marry me?\u201d\u201cDo you know how many daughters of city lords want to marry me?\u201d\u201cAnd do you know how many women I have turned down for you?\u201d\u201cBut you never looked at me!\u201d\u201cI hate it!!!\u201dJiang Mu was in pain, skillfully squeezing out two lines of tears, and looked sorrowfully at Xue Menghan.\u201cThe farthest distance in life is not life and death, but I am standing in front of you, but you do not know that I \u2026. Love \u2026. You\u2026\u201dAfter saying that, his eyes blackened and he \u2018fainted\u2019 in Ding Nanrong\u2019s soft arms.Phew~Damn, she finally said she was breaking off the marriage, but she scared Dad to death.Hehehe hope you did enjoy this novel.It\u2019s one of the novel, I\u2019m hooked to recently.I recommend, If you\u2019re looking for something calm your stress.

Then Xue Menghan said the withdrawal herself. And finally, Jiang Mu was so angry that he fell into a coma.Well, the plot was completed quite well.Tomorrow, I\u2019ll have to go to the Lihua Pavilion, eat, listen to some music, ask for a treat or something.Pleased.Jiang Mu fell into a beautiful sleep in Ding Nanrong\u2019s soft arms.Seeing him sleeping so peacefully, Ding Nanrong was quite speechless.She didn\u2019t say anything more, but fulfilled her duty as a personal attendant and picked Jiang Mu up in a princess carry.Then she walked straight towards the door.The crowd had not seen Ding Nanrong before because Jiang Mu was there.Only now that he was unconscious did the crowd take a serious look at Ding Nanrong.As the powerful maid of the Patriarch of the Wuyou Sect, Ding Nanrong was almost unknown in the entire Southern Realm.Today, she was not wearing a loose and ugly purple eggplant dress like before, and her hair was no longer messy and casual.Instead, she had changed into a busty short dress and wore a double braided jellyfish hairstyle.With her long, slender jade legs, excessive curves and gorgeous face, she looked like a new person.It turns out she is so beautiful \u2026. The crowd was in awe of the beauty of Ding Nanrong\u2019s figure.Even Ling Aotian, who considered himself to be very calm, swayed in awe at her attractive face.If Xue Menghan\u2019s beauty was that of a lady.Then, Ding Nanrong was a mature and cold beauty.These two beauties, in the entire Xue City, and even in the entire Southern Realm, apart from the Pavilion Master of the Lihua Pavilion and the Floor Master of the Dark Night Building.I\u2019m afraid that no one could ever find a fifth woman to match them!Ding Nanrong ignored the gazes of the crowd.She hugged Jiang Mu and glanced back at Ling Aotian as she walked to the door.This was the novel\u2019s male protagonist?There is indeed something.In the future, I\u2019ll have more good drama to watch. I won\u2019t have to be so bored.Thinking that, the corners of her mouth couldn\u2019t help but curl up a little.This smile of hers, in the eyes of the crowd, only felt stunning.Ling Aotian was also stunned.At the same time, he also felt a little startled and self-congratulatory.She was \u2026. laughing at me?It was only after Ding Nanrong left that Ling Aotian came back from his self-congratulation.Seeing that Xue Menghan was still aggrieved and angry, he went forward to comfort her and said.\u201cMenghan, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cThe Wuyou Sect has disciples breaking away every day, and within a few months, it will be weaker than Xue Cheng, and by then, the man surnamed Jiang won\u2019t be qualified to marry you.\u201d\u201cEven if he\u2019s desperate and wants to forcefully marry you with a marriage certificate, I, Ling Aotian, will definitely not let you marry him!\u201d\u201cI swear!\u201dLing Aotian rubbed the black ring on the middle finger of his left hand.In this black ring, the soul of a demon cultivator was lodged.That was his Master!With the help of her master, even if he faced a cultivator from the Returned Origin realm, he would still have the power to fight!\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Lord Ling.\u201dXue Menghan\u2019s mood was disturbed.If she hadn\u2019t seen the diary, then the result of this withdrawal would have been quite good for her.The problem was that now that she knew about the diary, she purposely did not follow what it said.And the result?It turned out to be almost exactly what the diary said, with the withdrawal drama taking place.It gave her a sense of powerlessness, and she hated the feeling of being set up by fate.\u201cI\u2019m tired, so excuse me, everyone.\u201dShe gave a blessed salute to the guests and was then flanked by the servant girls as they left.Seeing this, Ling Aotian also expressed his understanding.After all, if a good birthday banquet was suddenly forced into a divorce, no one would have the heart to continue the birthday banquet.The guests who were present also bid farewell to Xue Yuanshan one by one.Before leaving, there were some people who took the initiative to show their support to Ling Aotian.These people were not of low status. Some were the Patriarchs and elders of small sects, and some were representatives of the great clans of Xue City.In response, Ling Aotian responded to them all without being condescending.With this behavior, he revealed an excellent heart, causing Xue Yuanshan to esteem him a few more points higher.The night went on without a word.The next morning.Wuyou Sect.The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and the flowers were fragrant.The bedchamber of the main hall.Jiang Mu woke up early and enjoyed the chirping of the birds outside the window.While beautifully drinking a rice porridge Ding Nanrong had boiled for him.\u201cThis maid Ding Nanrong is truly something.\u201d\u201cThe food she cooks, it\u2019s really a hundred times better.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that I didn\u2019t suffer any injuries, otherwise, I would have been able to enjoy her various feedings.\u201dOriginally.In the original plot.Jiang Mu was unable to get out of bed for several days straight after being seriously injured by Ling Aotian.As for breakfast, lunch and dinner, they were all fed by Ding Nanrong.Even washing up was also done with her help.Yet now, he was eating, drinking and sleeping well, himself, alive and well.There was almost nothing wrong at all.\u201cAn attack that cancels out 50% of the damage is a real bull\u2019s-eye.\u201d\u201cThis was only the first day\u2019s reward, and it\u2019s already so powerful.\u201d\u201cWell then, what will today\u2019s reward be like?\u201dJiang Mu was looking forward to it.After finishing his Rice Porridge, he excitedly summoned his diary.He started writing today\u2019s diary.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The fantasy world is really magical.]Dark Night Building.Inside the room on the seventh floor.A beautiful blue-skirted woman with a shapely figure was lazily lying by her side on the bed couch.The heavy arcing mass seemed to be able to collapse the bed couch.At the moment, her jade hand is scratching around in the air.And under her breath she murmurs.\u201cAm I very old\u2026\u201d[After Ling Aotian saw this old demon woman, he was instantly stunned by her beauty, and fell in love with her, the same kind of love at first sight as when he saw Xue Menghan].[Yes, love at first sight. Maybe that\u2019s the attributes of a male protagonist.][Later, the old demon woman slowly discovered Ling Aotian\u2019s merits and fell in love with him too.][But this old demon woman is also stupid enough. She thinks Ling Aotian is too good, so she introduces Ling Aotian to her niece, trying to set them up.][Later, she found out that Ling Aotian had been pining for herself, so she deliberately avoided him, and as a result, she was actually killed by the demon race, just nigh on outrageous.][The niece also blackened because of her death and was actually killed by Ling Aotian in the end, a silly tragedy.]The author of this novel has pig fat in his head, right?This is a great drama for subscriptions, but how can you even kill her before you can even hold hands?The fact that you have no girlfriend is what you deserve.\u201cReally \u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat should I do \u2026.\u201dThe blue-skirted beauty\u2019s face was worried.This made the maid beside her, Juan\u2019er, very worried as well.\u201cMaster \u2026.\u201dJuan \u2018er wanted to open her mouth to ask.But seeing the beautiful woman\u2019s sad frown, she seemed to be thinking about something.So she did not dare to make a sound to disturb her.[No, I\u2019m the villain here. Why do I care about the death of these female protagonists].[Even if they don\u2019t die, it has nothing to do with me, so why would they fall in love with me as a villain?][Well, I\u2019m not in today\u2019s plot, so I don\u2019t have to work, so let\u2019s have fun.][Where should I go later?][Should I check on the training of the female disciples in the Sect, or should I go to the Lihua Pavilion to listen to a song and seek the Way?][As a good and honorable Patriarch, I should not harass the female disciples, so I\u2019d rather go to the Lihua Pavilion.][The sect has disciples running away every day, so if I do something senseless to the female disciples, the sect might just close down.][Oh yeah, according to the plot, the sect won\u2019t close down. It\u2019s even getting stronger.][Because I will have a wife, Han Yuqing, who is the pride of the Xuan Yang Sect.][After she married me and became the Patriarch\u2019s wife, she took over everything in the Wuyou Sect and slowly grew the clan later on.]\u2013The back of the clan\u2019s mountain, by the cliff.Ding Nanrong sat quietly on a stone bench, listening to the chirping of the birds in the trees behind her, her eyes dully watching the sunrise.Suddenly her heart felt something, and she summoned her diary.\u201cThe Wuyou Sect will not collapse \u2026. It is growing stronger and stronger \u2026.\u201dWhen she saw the contents, her gaze gradually revealed a cold aura.She had willingly submitted herself to become Jiang Mu\u2019s personal attendant in order to watch the slow destruction of the Wuyou Sect with her own eyes before finally killing Jiang Mu with her own hands.But now the diary was saying that the Wuyou Sect would grow in the future?This was completely contrary to her original intention.\u201cHan Yuqing \u2026.\u201dLooking at this name, Ding Nanrong\u2019s heart surged with killing intent, and her powerful spiritual aura suddenly radiated out, startling the birds in the trees into chattering and flying away.[Today, Han Yuqing will depart from the Xuan Yang Clan and head this way to the Wuyou Sect].[Damn, this woman is a pervert, a masochist, often self \u2026.][Ugh, forget it. Let\u2019s not talk about her.][A miserable childhood.]\u2014Xuan Yang Clan.Female disciples\u2019 dormitory, inside a room.A beautiful female disciple with a butterfly scar on her cheek was bathing in the bathtub.In one hand, she held the Private Diary of Jiang Mu and read it with great interest.With the other hand, she kept stroking her body.If Jiang Mu were here, he would be able to see that the abdomen, waist, hands and legs, and back that she had touched \u2026.. were all covered with dense and ugly scars!These dense and ugly scars were in the shape of nails, knife-shaped and thorny ropes \u2026.It was a great contrast to her beautiful face.It was like a beautiful porcelain doll with a ravaged body.\u201cWuyou Sect\u2026\u201d\u201cJiang Mu\u2026 Husband\u2026\u201d\u201d Hehe\u2026\u201dShe murmured and suddenly let out a strange laugh.When she saw the \u2018miserable childhood\u2019 at the end of the diary.Her face became a little pained.In her mind, a scene from her childhood gradually emerged, and her body began to shake.As images of her childhood became clearer, her body shook more and more, and the water in the bathtub, too, began to churn with the shaking.She habitually took out a knife and then, skillfully, cut herself on her arm.A slow cut.Slice by slice.Cutting from shallow to deep.Stretching back and forth.Bright red blood ran down the arm, soon staining the churning bath water red.The flesh of the arm turned over and the white bones were shockingly clear.The pain was so intense that her teeth chattered, her eyes half-closed, her breathing became more and more intense, and her forehead was seeping with sweat.A series of \u201cho-ho-ho\u201d sounds came out of her small cherry mouth.It looked as if she was in pain and the actual fact is that you can find a lot of people who are not able to get a good deal on a lot of things.[Ding, congratulate the host, writing diary successfully.][Temperament +1][Face value +1][Reward obtained: \u2018A Man of Steel Body\u2019][Reward Description: No one is tougher than Master. When attacked, return 100% of the damage of the attack to the opponent.]After the system voice.Jiang Mu then felt that his body, was imbued with a mysterious power.Clearly, the body had been strengthened.\u201cGreat !\u201d\u201cThis is a rigid divine technique!\u201dJiang Mu hammered his own body, which was so hard that it felt like he was hitting an iron.\u201cLet\u2019s say I take 100 points of damage attack from my opponent.\u201d\u201cThen it can counterbalance 100 points of damage to the opponent.\u201d\u201cPlus the previously rewarded \u2018Body of Pretending to Take a Beating\u2019 will cancel out 50 points of damage.\u201d\u201cDefence 50% + Counter Damage 100%.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a cow rubbing against a wire, a bull with lightning!\u201d\u201cSuch a conscientious golden finger, where else can you find it?\u201d\u201cLong live System Baba!\u201dJiang Mu was very pleased with this reward.As a villain, he had often been held down and beaten up.Even Ding Nanrong had been beaten and made him cry.And now with the \u2018A Man of Steel Body\u2019.He could not wait to go and fight Ding Nanrong in one-on-one, so that she could have a taste of her master\u2019s hardness.But he quickly dismissed this thought.Because.If he pissed her off, he might get seconds.\u201cLet\u2019s go, to the Lihua Pavilion to listen to the song Seeking the Way!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Infatuation or Licking the Dog?Closing his diary, Jiang Mu was ready to go out and have fun.Based on the experience of the previous seventy or so reincarnations.No matter what he did, as long as it didn\u2019t affect the main story, then it would be perfectly fine.Jiang Mu changed into a green and white normal disciple\u2019s robe.He then stole some of Ding Nanrong\u2019s cosmetics and gave himself a slight make-up disguise like the modern internet celebrity.As the head of a clan, he was a dignified figure in Xue City, and there were still many little fans within the clan who were obsessed with his power and face value.In order to avoid unnecessary trouble, it was best to disguise himself and lower his face value.After having disguised himself, Jiang Mu walked out of the patriarch\u2019s chambers and headed towards the sect\u2019s mountain gate.As the former overlord of the Southern Realm, the area covered by the Wuyou Sect was, well, very large.The sect was built on a huge mountain range that had been cut down to the ground.Jiang Mu\u2019s residence, the sect\u2019s main hall, was located to the north.The mountain gate, on the other hand, was located in the south.So.To walk from the main hall to the mountain gate, one would need to walk through the Hall of Elders, the disciples\u2019 dormitory complex, and so on.It takes a lot of time.Just think of it as enjoying the scenery.***\u201cHmm? What are they doing?\u201dUpon arriving at the huge lapis plaza.Jiang Mu was stunned to see that there were a few pretty female disciples who were confronting a few male disciples.It seemed like they were arguing about something.He intended to walk around, not wanting to interfere too much with the sect\u2019s affairs.But from their bickering, he could vaguely hear words like \u2018Patriarch Jiang\u2019, \u2018withdrawn from marriage\u2019 and \u2018waste\u2019.Damn, so they were swearing at me.How could this be tolerated?So Jiang Mu walked over.Just getting close.He heard the female disciples verbally abusing the male disciples.\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to talk about Patriarch Jiang like that!\u201d\u201cApologise to me now!\u201d\u201cRight! Apologise quickly!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright for you to leave the clan, but before you leave you still dare to belittle our Patriarch Jiang? Don\u2019t leave until you apologize!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you dare leave!\u201d\u201cApologize!\u201d\u201cApologize!\u201d\u2026A few male disciples on the other side heard this and sneered back in disdain.\u201cApologize my ass!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t what we said right?\u201d\u201cJiang Mu is foppy and incompetent, the Wuyou Sect will be destroyed sooner or later in his hands!\u201d\u201cJust last night, he was withdrawn from Xue Menghan\u2019s marriage and beaten to the point of vomiting blood and fainting by a Spirit Gathering Realm cultivator called Ling Aotian, he simply has no face left!\u201d\u201cAs the patriarch, his cultivation level is actually only at the Gathering Spirit realm, what a waste!\u201d\u201cHe even got high on pills, he couldn\u2019t even defeat Uncle Fu who was watching the mountain gate, I feel ashamed for him!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s even more humiliating is that just last night, Uncle Fu cursed out \u2018don\u2019t stay in the trash clan\u2019 and then ran away carrying the mountain gate overnight, what a sin!\u201d\u201cTch, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s not waste our lips with this group of brainless little fan girls of the sect leader.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, leave this rubbish clan.\u201d\u201cDown the mountain down the mountain.\u201d\u2026\u201cStop right there! You won\u2019t be allowed to leave until you apologise!\u201dThe female disciples were furious.You\u2019ve slandered Patriarch Jiang and you still want to go down the mountain?No way!They drew their swords in a fierce manner and stopped the male disciples.The male disciples were also furious, and they too drew their swords with a clang clang clang.The tension was at its peak.Just as the battle was about to break out, Jiang Mu immediately intervened and spoke out.\u201cSenior sisters and brothers, what\u2019s going on?\u201dSeeing someone coming, the crowd turned their heads to look.It was good-looking.His skin was gelatin white. His features were angular, and those deep eyes seemed to contain two parts of a languid indifference to the world.Even though he was wearing the same ordinary disciple\u2019s uniform as them, he could not conceal his outstanding aura.So handsome!This junior disciple\u2019s face was almost as handsome as Patriarch Jiang\u2019s!This was the reaction of the female disciples.But they quickly cooled down.All over the sect, almost all the male disciples despised Patriarch Jiang.Those who broke away from the sect every day were also almost exclusively male disciples.And I was afraid that this handsome senior disciple, who had appeared here, was also going to break away from the sect.When the male disciples saw Jiang Mu, it was as if they had seen a teammate, and they asked him to judge the situation.\u201cThis senior brother, you tell us.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re leaving this rubbish sect.\u201d\u201cAnd it turns out that this group of brainless sect master fan girls are trying to stop us.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s annoying?\u201dThe female disciples raged, \u201cWho told you to slander Patriarch Jiang!\u201dThe male disciples snorted, \u201cIt\u2019s true, Jiang Mu is foppy and arrogant, and too lazy to cultivate, all he does is think about his Menghan, Menghan, Menghan, he\u2019s simply a wasteful licking dog.\u201dThe female disciples said angrily, \u201cLick your mother\u2019s dog, You called Patriarch Jiang is infatuated!\u201d\u201cObsessed with your father\u2019s love is a waste licking dog.\u201d\u201cIdiots!\u201d\u201cWaste licking a dog.\u201d\u201cInfatuation!\u201d\u201cWaste licking dogs.\u201d\u201cInfatuation!\u201d\u201cWanker licker.\u201d\u2026\u201cAhem, everyone, why don\u2019t you hear a word from me, senior brother? Fair and square is guaranteed.\u201dJiang Mu stopped their argument.Both sides really stopped.Both wanted to hear what his so-called fairness and impartiality was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 - Sect Master Jiang Is the Most Handsome in the Cangling World!Jiang Mu cleared his throat and said it seriously and scrupulously.\u201cPatriarch Jiang is a gentle and elegant man, a talented man, filial to his parents and kind to others. He is dedicated to the development of the sect and incomparably devoted to his personal relationships. Even if he is so handsome that he has no friends, he has never been a womanizer. He is a man of high moral character, often repaying grudges with virtue. He is pure of heart and never bullies others. He treated women with even more care and attention, especially his own personal attendant, with nothing but love. He was able to enlighten the world\u2019s pale mountains by instructing them in literature, and to establish world peace by exterminating the demon race in martial arts. He, Jiang Mu, Patriarch Jiang, is indeed the number one handsome and good-looking man in our Li Prefecture, even in the Kyushu Continent, even in the entire Cang Ling Realm, who is the best in the ancient and modern times, and who dominates the universe!!!\u201dClang!A sword fell to the ground.The male disciples were all dumbfounded.This senior brother \u2026 He\u2019s crazy!This is fucking nonsense!The female disciples, however, were excited.\u201cBrother is so right!\u201d\u201cYes, yes! Patriarch Jiang is the number one handsome and good-looking man in the Cang Ling Realm!\u201d\u201cLong live senior brother! Long live Patriarch Jiang!\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you apologize!\u201d\u201cApologize now!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t apologize, you\u2019ll never get off the mountain!\u201d\u201cYes! Apologize!\u201d\u201cApologize!\u201d\u201cApologize!\u201d\u2026\u201cApologize for fuck\u2019s sake! Gibbering brain-dead bastard, get lost!\u201dOne of the rude-looking male disciples, he finally couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, picked up the sword on the ground, and slashed down at a soft female disciple right in the head.\u201cWaaaah~!\u201dThe soft female disciple screamed in terror, unable to dodge in time.In a flash of lightning, a magnificent figure stood in front of her.The sword viciously struck the figure\u2019s shoulder with a muffled \u2018ta\u2019 sound of steel.\u201cAh!\u201dThat rude disciple, suddenly screamed out in pain and misery, covering his shoulder as his entire body fell backwards.Hiss!The crowd sucked in a breath of cold air backwards.They were horrified to find that the rude disciple\u2019s shoulder had cracked open a blood slit in a bizarre manner!This bloody slit was as if it had been split by a sword!This senior disciple he \u2026. What the hell has he done?The crowd looked at Jiang Mu, who was unharmed, and all felt a sense of disbelief.Jiang Mu looked at the rude disciple on the ground indifferently.Although the surface was calm.In fact, he was happy inside.Defending against 50% damage and returning 100% damage.That\u2019s great!In the future, if he was attacked, he might be able to counter-death his opponent even if he stood still.Very awesome!In fact, the reason why Jiang Mu took the initiative to go forward and get slashed.It was mainly to test out the 100% anti-damage effect of \u2018Forced Steel Body\u2019.Now, it seemed that under the same realm, one should be invincible.After all, the opponent had fallen before he had even made a move.\u201cThis senior brother, what have you done to senior brother Li \u2026. What did you do?\u201dThe male disciples asked Jiang Mu with dread.They couldn\u2019t believe they couldn\u2019t see how Jiang Mu had attacked and injured Senior Brother Li in return!The only thing they could think of was that Jiang Mu had used some mysterious and powerful spiritual technique, or had hidden his cultivation.\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything, maybe he accidentally cut himself.\u201dJiang Mu replied perfunctorily, then said indifferently.\u201cBy all accounts, the few of you, are no longer disciples of the Wuyou Sect.\u201cAnd this benevolent brother Li wanted to attack and kill a disciple of the Wuyou Sect, which is a capital offense according to the sect\u2019s rules.\u201cYou, as his companions, are accomplices.\u201cTherefore, you are the mortal enemies of the Wuyou Sect.\u201dMortal\u2026. Mortal enemies?!The male disciples panicked at once.Only then did they remember that the Wuyou Sect did have such a rule.So they scrambled to apologize desperately.\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u201cWe were wrong!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re wasteful licking dogs!\u201d\u201cPatriarch Jiang is an infatuated talent!\u201d\u201cPatriarch Jiang is the number one handsome man in the Cang Ling Realm!\u201d\u201cWe love Patriarch Jiang for life!\u201d\u2026\u201cAlright, alright, you guys can go.\u201dJiang Mu felt distressed and casually waved his hand for them to leave.After they ran off in fear.The few female disciples leapt around, all yelling that they wanted to make Jiang Mu\u2019s acquaintance.Especially which one was the soft little fan girl who had been saved.Her face was red to the point of dripping blood, her little hand twisting the edge of her skirt as she peeked down shyly at Jiang Mu, saying that she wanted to visit Jiang Mu\u2019s private residence.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have things to do, bye.\u201dJiang Mu didn\u2019t want to dwell too much, and after throwing down a sentence, he walked towards the mountain gate without looking back.Not caring at all about the group of female disciples\u2019 loss.***Xue City, on the street.\u201cMenghan, you don\u2019t seem too happy?\u201dLing Aotian followed Xue Menghan and headed to the Dark Night House together.But along the way, he noticed that Xue Menghan seemed very unhappy.\u201cNo, I\u2019m quite happy.\u201dXue Menghan was calm on the surface, but inwardly she was depressed.Happy my ass!Originally, she had planned to go to the Lihua Pavilion and stop Jiang Mu from listening to the song.The purpose was to ruin Jiang Mu\u2019s good deed and get back at him for calling her a silly dog in his diary.More importantly, to keep herself from taking Ling Aotian to that whatever Dark Night House as stated in the diary.After all, she hated the feeling of being set up by fate.Who knew.Before she could step out the door herself, she was called by her father.He said that Ling Aotian wanted to be informed of some intelligence information, so he asked her to take him to the Dark Night House.Because the Dark Night House\u2019s ability to collect information and intelligence was top-notch, the City Lord\u2019s House also often bought all kinds of intelligence from the Dark Night House, such as demon beasts.Before she left, her father whispered to her that Ling Aotian was very good, with great potential and excellent character, and that his future achievements would be extraordinary.She was so depressed that she wanted to hit the tofu.\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business that he has great potential.\u201d\u201cIf he wants to go to the Dark Night House, just ask a servant to take him there.\u201d\u201cWhy does it have to be me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what father thinks.\u201d\u201cHumph.\u201dXue Menghan muttered under her breath, very dissatisfied with her father\u2019s arrangement.\u201cMenghan, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dLing Aotian vaguely heard what she was saying, so he curiously went forward to ask.\u201cNothing much, we\u2019re almost at the Dark Night House.\u201dXue Menghan did not want to talk and quickened her pace.People came and went in the street.Many people had admiring expressions when they saw Xue Menghan.They also whispered.\u201cHey, have you heard, last night, Xue Qianjin actually withdrew her marriage to Patriarch Jiang!\u201d\u201cYes, worthy of being Xue Qianjin, her temper is still so stubborn.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for sure, Patriarch Jiang is so useless, he\u2019s not worthy of our number one beauty in Xue City!\u201d\u201cAccording to me, even if we don\u2019t withdraw the marriage, when the Wuyou Sect is spanned by Patriarch Jiang, Patriarch Jiang will be a useless waste licking dog with nothing to lose, and that piece of paper marriage will be useless.\u201d\u201cIndeed, a waste licking dog with no potential licks nothing at the end of the day.\u201d\u201cSpeaking of potential, I think that lad called Ling Aotian is pretty good.\u201d\u201cLing Aotian?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s the one behind Xue Qianjin, the lad in black.\u201dThe eyes of the crowd turned to Ling Aotian behind Xue Menghan.They could see that he had a cold face, an elegant gaze, and an athletic stance.That steady and powerful stride seemed to reveal a sense of confidence.\u201cHe\u2019s quite handsome, he\u2019s almost equal to Patriarch Jiang.\u201d\u201cHandsome has no use, strength is the king.\u201d\u201cAgreed, this Ling Aotian looks just like Patriarch Jiang, he\u2019s only in his early twenties, although his cultivation level is only at the Spirit Gathering realm, the power he exerts is straight out of the Qi Sea realm, he beat Patriarch Jiang until he vomited blood and passed out!\u201d\u201cHiss, those who can reach the Qi Sea realm are usually over thirty years old, this Ling Aotian is indeed very strong.\u201d***Ling Aotian\u2019s ears were not weak, and as he listened to the words of the people around him, he was inwardly flattered.As he was immersed in hearing his praises, he heard Xue Menghan\u2019s voice in front of him.\u201cThe Dark Night House has arrived.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - To My Son...At those words, Ling Aotian raised his eyes to look.There was an ancient-looking tower-like building in front of him, which was seven floors high, taller than any of the surrounding architectural buildings by a large margin.On the plaque at the door of the building were three large words made from the white bones of unknown demonic beasts stitched together.Dark Night Building.\u201cYou go in, I\u2019m leaving.\u201dXue Menghan said to him, and turned to leave.\u201cMeng Han, aren\u2019t you going to accompany me inside, where are you going?\u201dLing Aotian called out to her.Ever since he met Xue Menghan in the Demon Beast Mountain Range, he had fallen in love with her, the kind of love at first sight.Whether it was Xue Menghan\u2019s voice and smile, or her delicate and rebellious innocent character, Ling Aotian liked her very, very much.It was just that he didn\u2019t know how to ask for affection, so he could only slowly enhance his feelings by spending time together through life encounters.\u201cGo in by yourself, I\u2019m going to have breakfast.\u201dXue Menghan threw down a casual sentence and walked away without looking back.Breakfast?Looking at her pretty back as she left, Ling Aotian raised his eyebrows, expressing his disbelief.They just came over after eating breakfast.So, Xue Menghan was lying to him.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\u201cWhen it comes to developing a relationship, you have to take your time.\u201d\u201cI believe that with my true feelings.\u201d\u201d Menghan will definitely be moved and eventually become my woman.\u201dThinking about it, Ling Aotian revealed a confident yet evil smile.This caused some of the young girls around him to steal glances shyly.Ling Aotian swept a glance at those individual ordinary maidens and shook his head.\u201cCompared to Menghan, they are too mediocre.\u201d\u201d I Ling Aotian\u2019s woman must at least be a beauty of Menghan\u2019s level.\u201dAfter thinking, he turned around in a dashing manner and walked towards the Dark Night Building.***Xue Menghan circled around for some time before arriving in front of a brothel.Lihua Pavilion.At the entrance of the Lihua Pavilion, and at the first floor balcony, there were charming women dressed in fancy clothes.They waved their handkerchiefs and greeted the men, who passed by with a whisper.\u201cCome on, sir\u2026\u201dXue Menghan was disgusted by the sight.\u201cThis Jiang, who says he only loves me, comes to this kind of place early in the morning.\u201d\u201cAnd listening to songs and seeking the way? What can you seek for in a brothel?\u201d\u201cYuck, not a good thing!\u201dSpitting in a dark voice, Xue Menghan sneakily slipped inside, intending to ask the pimp inside.\u201cMiss Xue? Why are you here?\u201dWhen the sharp-eyed pimp saw Xue Menghan enter, she hurriedly greeted her.It was a professional habit. The pimp walked with her hips twisted in an exaggerated manner. The fan in her hand kept fanning herself, and the strong fragrance from her body wafted everywhere.Xue Menghan almost vomited out her breakfast as she choked.She forced herself to hold back her stomach and pulled the pimp to the corner, covering her face with her hands and lowering her voice to ask.\u201cI\u2019m asking you which room is Jiang Mu in?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201dThe pimp thought she had heard something wrong, and the fan in her hand nearly fell to the floor.Xue Menghan lowered her voice again and said, \u201cJiang Mu, Patriarch Jiang.\u201d\u201cPatriarch Jiang? He has never come to the Lihua Pavilion.\u201dThe old pimp covered her mouth with her troupe fan, her eyes staring like quail eggs, her face full of disbelief.It was common knowledge.Although Patriarch Jiang was arrogant and wasteful.But he was a truly obsessed man, in love with Xue Menghan alone.So it was simply impossible that he would, whoring.What\u2019s more, it was only last night that the two of them had made a scene of withdrawing their marriage.How come today it seems\u2026 It was as if Xue Menghan was coming to catch Patriarch Jiang in adultery?\u201cNever come?\u201dXue Menghan\u2019s eyebrows were slightly stretched.For some reason, when she knew that Jiang Mu had never come to the brothel, she felt, inwardly, a tiny bit of pleasure.Xue Menghan fiercely shook off the strange thoughts.At this time.A man came behind the old pimp, and in his tone was an indescribably relaxed man.\u201cHey hey, why are you hiding here in the corner, you old pimp? Quickly arrange a young skilled woman for this gentleman \u2026. Uh \u2026. You know, a young girl with a lot of talent.\u201dHmm?This familiar voice, why does it sound so much like that guy Jiang Mu?Xue Menghan\u2019s gaze, through the fingers of her hands, sized up the young man in front of her.Seeing that he was quite distinguished looking, but it wasn\u2019t Jiang Mu.The man had obviously noticed her too.Although she had covered her face with her hands, that delicate figure, wrapped in a slim, emerald-colored dress, was displayed to perfection.In particular, the cone-shaped curves that were playfully straightened out due to the raised arms were exceptionally eye-catching.Ooh, this is a good one!The man was none other than Jiang Mu, who had changed his face.He didn\u2019t expect that there would be such a superb beauty in the Lihua Pavilion, and this perfect body was almost as good as Xue Menghan\u2019s.If he hadn\u2019t known that Xue Menghan was at the Dark Night Pavilion, he would have thought that this woman was her.\u201cThis young peach, I must say, There really are quite multi-talented little sister here. yo.\u201dWhen the old pimp saw a customer, a professional smile immediately appeared on her face.She took Jiang Mu\u2019s arm, pressing half of her body onto him, and enthusiastically introduced him.\u201cThe girls at our Lihua Pavilion are all very beautiful.\u201cEspecially the four little golden flowers, they all have great skills.\u201cThe spring flower is the Dragon Slaying Eighteen.\u201cThe summer flower has two rabbits in one carving.\u201cAutumn flowers have a sound of hollow sound.\u201cThe winter flower is a mouth of music.\u201cWhich one do you want, my lord?\u201d***\u201cNone of them, I want her.\u201dJiang Mu smiled and pointed at Xue Menghan.With such perfect body proportions, how would her looks be any harder to look at?Besides, once the blanket was covered, the world was full of love.It was worth it.\u201cHuh? Her? No way no way \u2026.\u201dThe old pimp\u2019s hand shivered and the fan fell to the ground, clearly startled.You\u2019 re letting the city lord\u2019s daughter pick up customers?It\u2019s profitable, but there would be no life to spend!\u201cWhy not?\u201dJiang Mu didn\u2019t understand.\u201cBecause\u2026 Because she\u2019s not from the Lihua Pavilion, she\u2019s just here to \u2026. to sell demon beast insurance, yes.\u201dThe old pimp saw that Xue Menghan didn\u2019t make a sound, so she had to harden her heart to explain.\u201cThat\u2019s so, forget it then, sorry about that girl.\u201dJiang Mu apologized to Xue Menghan, feeling pity.\u201cGongzi, let\u2019s go up to the first floor \u2026.\u201dThe old pimp hurriedly pulled Jiang Mu up towards the first floor to prevent him from saying anything that would anger Xue Menghan.Xue Menghan was indeed furious.She had been treated like a prostitute!It was all Jiang\u2019s fault!She was so angry that she stomped her feet, wishing she could give Jiang Mu a punch in the back when she saw him later.But now there were more and more people, and she was afraid of being treated like a prostitute again, so she covered her face and fled out of the Lihua Pavilion, intending to squat outside.Inside room number eight on the first floor.The pimp threw a wink at Jiang Mu.\u201cPlease wait a moment, Your Excellency, the four little golden flowers have just woken up, they are taking a bath, they will be ready soon\u00a0\u00a0\u201dAfter saying that, she wiggled her sexy hips and went out.\u201cI have to wait for more?\u201dJiang Mu was a bit depressed and could only lie down on the big red bed, looking at the ceiling in a hundred different ways.\u201cWell, it\u2019s a waste of time waiting anyway.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t I write in my diary and see if I can swipe some good rewards?\u201dSo he sat up and summoned his diary.Wrote something at random.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019m pretty excited.][When the four young beauties arrive later, I\u2019ll have a good experience of what it means to drown in the pleasure of young peaches.][But I was more attracted to the insurance girl by the entrance than to the four flowers.]????\u201cThe entrance?\u201d\u201cInsurance girl?\u201dXue Menghan, who was hiding at the corner of the street to spy on the Lihua Pavilion, stared at the diary in her hand in confusion.\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d[Because of this insurance woman\u2019s body, it was so perfect, even her long skirt was as green as Xue Menghan\u2019s.][It\u2019s a pity that her hands covered her face, so I couldn\u2019t see her appearance.][But she should be quite pretty, right?][After all, she sells demon beast insurance.]\u201cHands covering her face\u2026 Long green dress\u2026 Demon beast insurance\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that me?\u201d\u201cThen the man just now was\u2026?\u201dAfter thinking for a while, Xue Menghan then came to her senses.It turned out.The man who had mistaken her for a prostitute at the Lihua Pavilion just now.It was Jiang Mu!\u201cWell done, Jiang!\u201d\u201cSo that man is you!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be such a person, and actually disguised yourself to go whoring!\u201dXue Menghan became so furious that she punched the wall to crack it.It scared the sleeping dog in the courtyard behind the wall, \u2018wang wang wang\u2019, and barked.\u201cWait.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s none of my business if he\u2019s whoring or not? Why should I be angry?\u201d\u201cHmph, it must be because he treated me like a whore, that\u2019s why I\u2019m angry, yes that\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cYou bastard! I\u2019ll never forgive you for treating me like a whore!\u201dIn anger, she punched the wall again and broke it.\u2018Wang wang wang wang.\u2019[Oh yes.][Now at this time, Xue Menghan, with Ling Aotian, should have already gone inside the Dark Night Building.][Pfft hahahahaha, come to think of it.][In Dark Night House, Ling Aotian was looked down upon, so the two sides clashed and got into a fight. Sure enough, he\u2019s the main character. He can pull hatred wherever he goes.][As a result, one can imagine even with toenails that it is Ling Aotian who has hit the other side in the face with the clich\u00e9d routine.][Then Ling Aotian gave a charming smile to Xue Menghan, who instantly blushed and fell for Ling Aotian once again.][Silly dog heroine, there\u2019s no IQ at all.]\u201cSurnamed Jiang, you are scolding me again!\u201dXue Menghan threw the diary away in anger, gritting her teeth and staring at the Lihua Pavilion.Being mistaken for a prostitute was not enough.But mock her as an idiot, silly dog, and make fun of her IQ?She was furious.Plus the noise of the dogs barking behind the wall, it was extremely annoying.\u2018Wang, wang, wang, wang, wang\u2019.\u201cWhat\u2019s the hell\u2019s wrong with this lousy dog!\u201dShe punched the wall once again in hatred. The bricks flew and hit the dog\u2019s head, causing it to cry in pain and piss and flee.Xue Menghan arrived at a mask stall in a rage and bought a pig\u2019s head mask with a vengeance.And then put it on fiercely.She had decided.To go into Lihua Pavilion and beat up the man Jiang until he turns into a pig\u2019s head!***[Also, due to Ling Aotian\u2019s outstanding performance, he received the appreciation of the Dark Night Housemaster][Damn, the owner of this Dark Night House is one of the three great beauties of Xue City.][And she\u2019s also the second female lead. She\u2019s just as beautiful as Xue Menghan.][I\u2019m so jealous of the protagonist, I want to start a harem, too.

Your waist has been strengthened.]\u201cThis reward??\u201d\u201cWho the hell needs this, does the dog system look down on people!\u201dJiang Mu felt insulted.He twisted his waist.He found that no matter how he twisted, folded or bent it, he didn\u2019t feel the slightest bit tired.Apparently, the waist had been greatly enhanced and had become very, very, very flexible and tough.\u201cHmm. Not a bad reward, I guess.\u201d***Dark Night Building.Seventh floor, inside a spacious and elegant room.\u201cAm I the second female lead\u2026?\u201dA beautiful blue-skirted woman with a voluptuous figure leaned lazily by the window, enjoying the warm sunlight while flipping through.The Private Diary of Jiang Mu.\u201cWill I really appreciate Ling Aotian?\u201dShe wanted to test the male protagonist Ling Aotian mentioned in her diary to see if she would really appreciate him.After pondering for a while, she called out softly\u201cJuan\u2019er.\u201dThe door to the room was immediately opened and in came a blue-clothed maid.\u201cWhat are the Master orders?\u201d\u201cBring Ling Aotian up here.\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201dAfter Juan \u2018er retreated.She closed the diary and entered the side bathroom, taking off a blue dress and preparing to bathe.The hall on the ground floor.Ling Aotian was sitting and waiting.Originally, he had wanted to buy information about the Ling family village five years ago.But the shopkeeper told him that the information was a high level secret and that he needed to wait for the person in charge to come before he could buy it.During the boring wait, Ling Aotian listened to the chatter of the others, as a way to relieve his boredom.\u201cBrother Tang, I saw your daughter-in-law enter Wang fugui\u2019s house last night, are you buying information about Wang fugui\u2019s his ancestors now?\u201d\u201cNo, what I\u2019m buying is information on demonic beasts.\u201d\u201cInformation on demon beasts? That\u2019s very expensive!\u201d\u201cExpensive? I\u2019m rich.\u201d\u201cWhere did you get the money, Brother Tang? By the way, aren\u2019t you looking for revenge on Wang Fugui? Your daughter-in-law\u2019s legs were shaking badly when she came out of his house this morning.\u201d\u201cHow can I have money if her legs aren\u2019t shaking? Without money how can Laozi come to the Dark Night House to buy information on demon beasts? Are you stupid.\u201d\u201c???? Could this money be your daughter-in-law \u2026. Brother Tang, you wouldn\u2019t be doing this for tomorrow\u2019s \u2026. Hunting season, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s for the hunting season, tomorrow, I will definitely hunt the demon cores, many, many demon cores, and make a fierce fucking profit!\u201d\u201cBrother Tang is a great man! Brother Tang is not a small man! Brother Tang will definitely make a fortune tomorrow!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for sure.\u201d\u201cBut brother Tang, your daughter-in-law\u2026\u201d\u201cHa! Why do you keep mentioning my daughter-in-law, do you want to come to my house for dinner tonight?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d***\u201cHunting Season \u2026.\u201dLing Aotian thought silently.About the hunting season. Lord Xue City had already told him about it last night.Once every three months, Xue City would hold a hunting event for demonic beasts, referred to as the hunting season.The benefits of the hunting season were numerous.Not only could it reduce the number of demonic beasts, lowering the pressure on Xue City and contributing to humans.It also allows you to hunt demon beasts and practice to improve.And the skins, flesh, blood, bones, and so on of the demon beasts can be sold for money.If you are lucky enough to hunt a demon core, then you will make a fortune.This is because demon cores are extremely useful and can be used as energy for airships, formations, spiritual weapons, and so on.However, not all demon beasts are born with demon cores.This also led to the price of demon cores being very expensive.\u201cDemon Cores \u2026.\u201dLing Aotian caressed the black ring on the middle finger of his left hand.\u201cMaster\u2019s strength can be restored by absorbing demon cores.\u201d\u201cThen it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to go to tomorrow\u2019s hunting season \u2026.\u201dIn the midst of his thoughts.A blue-clothed maid with a pretty face arrived in front of him in a modest manner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I see that you have not stepped into the Spirit Gathering Realm for a few years, what do you have that is worthy of the building owner\u2019s attention, apart from a good skin?!\u201dLing Aotian\u2019s gaze instantly went cold.He disliked such people who looked at people with dog eyes and coldly replied.\u201cWhat\u2019s it has to do with you!\u201dThe thick-haired burly man scoffed, \u201cHeh, Laozi doesn\u2019t like to see you.\u201dLing Aotian narrowed his eyes, \u201cSo?\u201dThe burly-haired man snapped his thumbs up over his ears and said it with contempt.\u201cDon\u2019t say that old me is bullying you, We are at the same spirit gathering realm, if you beat old me, I will let you go up to the seventh floor, otherwise, you can crawl out of the Dark Night Building from under old me\u2019s crotch.\u201dIt aroused laughter in the hall at these words.Ling Aotian also laughed in exasperation, \u201cHeh, why should I fight you? Reason?\u201dThe thick-haired burly man said impatiently, \u201cWhat\u2019s all that nonsense, gibbering like a pussy.\u201dSaying that, he sneaked up on Ling Aotian and flicked the yellow and black earwax of his thumb at him.Ling Aotian dodged in surprise.The ball of earwax stayed past the tip of his nose and shot into the mouth of a boy in the crowd.Vomit!!!The boy fainted on the spot spitting up foam, and the crowd covered their mouths and recoiled.Ling Aotian was instantly enraged.\u201cLooking for death!\u201dHe burst out furiously with his spiritual power, and his entire body dashed in front of the thick-haired burly man.In an instant.He punched out, his fist hitting the thick-haired man\u2019s face solidly.The burly-haired man was sent flying on the spot without any resistance.After hitting the pillar and landing on the ground with a *Thud*, his eyes rolled back and he passed out at the spot.\u201cBah, what the heck. He only talks big!\u201dLing Aotian coldly put away his fist and spat a mouthful of spit in the face of the thick-haired burly man on the ground.It ended up failing to control itself and smeared on his blackened lips.One move \u2026. The eyes of the people around changed as they looked at Ling Aotian.Both sides were at the Spirit Gathering Realm, and this man defeated the opponent in one move!Even some Qi Hai realm second level cultivators felt pressure when they saw that punch from Ling Aotian just now!It was then.Only then did someone recognize Ling Aotian and could not help but exclaim.\u201cI know! It\u2019s him, Ling Aotian!\u201dWhat?Ling Aotian?It was only then that the crowd came to a sudden realization, and then they all commented on it.\u201cHe\u2019s the man who pulled out of the marriage for Xue Qianjin last night?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the man who beat Patriarch Jiang to coma after vomiting blood?\u201d\u201cAh? Is that him? No wonder the owner invited him!\u201d\u201cThis man is so brave!\u201d\u201cThis man is extraordinary!\u201d\u2026Now, all of them, no longer looked down on Ling Aotian.They even felt that he had great potential and would become a great asset in the future!\u201cSir Ling, you \u2026.\u201dJuan\u2019er was surprised as she looked at Ling Aotian.She naturally knew about Ling Aotian\u2019s deed from last night.Only that she hadn\u2019t seen it with her own eyes, so she didn\u2019t think much of it.However, when she saw his strength with her own eyes today, this was when she was truly shocked.So powerful.No wonder the owner met him alone.!I guess the owner must have already known about his potential.Silently thinking, she looked at Ling Aotian\u2019s back, a curious look passing through her gaze.Ling Aotian turned around in a dashing manner and faced Juan\u2019er, saying.\u201cMiss Juan\u2019er, let\u2019s proceed up to the seventh floor, please lead the way.\u201dAfter saying that, he smiled devilishly.So handsome!Juan\u2019er\u2019s heart skipped a beat instantly.This devilish look, this sprightly and confident aura, made her face heat up, her head even got a little dizzy, and she couldn\u2019t help but show off her blushing face.This feeling \u2026. So wonderful \u2026.She hurriedly turned around, covered her heaving breasts, and took a deep breath.Then, forcing herself to stay calm, she walked towards the stairs.Only she spoke in a voice that had become less natural.\u201cLing\u2026 Mr. Ling, please\u2026 Please follow me\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dLing Aotian let out a smile and followed directly up.Soon, the two of them went up to the seventh floor.On the top floor of the seventh floor, there was only one room.That was the private residence of the Dark Night Building\u2019s owner, Lu Chorou.Juan\u2019er pushed open the door to the room.After Ling Aotian entered, Juan\u2019er closed the door.And before the door closed, she stole a shy glance at Ling Aotian\u2019s back through the doorway, and her face couldn\u2019t help but blush again.Even the standing posture was so handsome.The spacious and elegant room was filled with a faint fragrance.Ling Aotian held his head high and his gaze was like a torch as he looked around.If he was right, that owner of the building should be secretly watching him.So one had to leave a good impression.In front of him was a screen painted with a sea of blue flowers.Behind the screen, the heat was dense, the scent of flowers was overwhelming, and the sound of running water, with the soft hum of a woman, was a delight to the ears.The owner of this building is bathing?His heart was inexplicably filled with anticipation.She called me here alone. Now, is she seducing me.?That\u2019s right! She must have investigated me and known about my potential!In that case, she probably has her eye on me!The corners of Ling Aotian\u2019s mouth couldn\u2019t help but rise as he narrowed his eyes slightly.He immediately took a step towards the screen.Suddenly.Just when it was time to cross the screen and enter the bathroom.A few invisible sound waves stirred out from behind the screen.Like a million tiny needles, the sound waves pierced Ling Aotian\u2019s ears and then began to rampage through his brain.Almost instantly, Ling Aotian felt the entire world turn upside down and chaotic, plunging into an endless shrill buzzing.\u201cAahhh\u2026!\u201dHe clutched his head in pain and fell to his knees. His face was extremely red. His forehead was bruised, and a hoarse, low roar came from his throat.He felt as if his soul was about to be torn apart and stripped away!Gradually.After the sound waves dissipated, his entire body slumped weakly to the ground.At this moment, his clothes were already wet with cold sweat. His breathing became wheezy and heavy. His head still felt spinning, and his soul trembled in shock.\u201cLing Aotian, right? To be able to withstand my Sound Soul Technique and not pass out, you\u2019re quite good.\u201dA soft, ripe female voice rang out in Ling Aotian\u2019s ears.He looked up with difficulty despite the dizziness.The slender jade feet were dripping with water, and the long blue dress, which covered the top and bottom, was hollow but revealed a sexy navel, and upwards, over the peaks and ravines, he could see the provocative collarbone and the tempting jade neck.The jade hair is pinned, and the crystal earlobes are hung with sky blue jade earrings.Face like peach blossom, eyes like flowing years, shallow smile and peaceful, softness, and more than poise!\u201d Beautiful \u2026.\u201dLing Aotian looked dumbfounded.If Xue Menghan was a clear and astringent showy lotus.Then, this Dark Night House\u2019s owner, Lu Chorou, was a peach ripe and waiting to be picked.She was worthy of being one of the top three beauties in Xue City!When Lu Churou saw Ling Aotian staring at her, she was a little surprised and then.This was the so-called\u2026 Male protagonist?He\u2019s quite weak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It makes me happy to hear Mr. Ling say that.\u201dLu Chu Rou revealed a smile and asked again.\u201cDoes Sir Ling like me?\u201d\u201d That\u2019 \u2026.\u201dLing Aotian\u2019s ears went \u2018swish\u2019 red.Why did she suddenly ask that question?Could it be that she\u2026 likes me?I don\u2019t quite understand.But since she had asked so bluntly, then why did he have to shrink back?Ling Aotian took a deep breath to calm down.He looked into Lu Chorou\u2019s beautiful peach blossom eyes and said truthfully.\u201cLove it! Ever since the first moment I saw you, I knew that I had fallen in love with you, you could say it was love at first sight!\u201d\u201cLove at first sight, huh?..\u201dLu Chorou muttered, basically confirming the authenticity of the diary.She looked at the contents of the diary.[Later, this old demon woman slowly discovered Ling Aotian\u2019s merits and fell in love with him too.][But this old demon woman was silly enough. She thought Ling Aotian was too good, so she introduced Ling Aotian to her niece, wanting to set them up.][Later, she found out that Ling Aotian had been yearning for herself, so she deliberately avoided him, and as a result, she was killed by the demon race, just nigh on outrageous.][The niece also blackened because of her death and was killed by Ling Aotian in the end, a silly tragedy.]\u2013After my own death, Qu Nishan was also killed by Ling Aotian.\u2013Tragedy \u2026.Seeing this ending for herself and her niece, Lu Churou\u2019s heart was filled with sorrow.She had recently been collecting information on the young talents of the nine great sects within the Kyushu continent.The purpose, was to find a good husband for her niece, Qu Nishan.If Ling Aotian was good enough to suppress those prides of the heavens.Then.She, Lu Churou, would definitely introduce Ling Aotian to Qu Nishan and find ways to set them up.To her, her niece\u2019s happiness was above everything.Yet now.The diary said that this would end in tragedy.\u2013If I want to change this ending, I firstly cannot like Ling Aotian.\u2013The second thing is that I can\u2019t introduce Ling Aotian to Qu Nishan.\u2013Or else \u2026.\u2013Should I Kill Ling Aotian, the male lead?The thought rose in Lu Chorou\u2019s mind.She looked towards Ling Aotian, and her soft gaze gradually exuded killing intent.At the same time, the long blue dress on her body floated without wind.????? Ling Aotian took two steps back with caution.For some reason, he suddenly felt a sense of oppression.It was as if what was in front of him was not a reclining beauty, but a fierce beast that would rise up to kill at any moment!Lu Chorou, however, instantly withdrew her aura and faintly shook her head.She dismissed the idea of \u2018killing the male protagonist\u2019.\u2013Since it\u2019s a fictional world, the story might become out of control once Ling Aotian, who is the male protagonist, dies.\u2013It could also lead to the fact that Jiang Mu\u2019s diary would disappear and I wouldn\u2019t be able to peek into future events.\u2013Worse case, it could all just end.\u2013So, unless forced to, Ling Aotian is best left unkilled.\u2013In that case \u2026.After some deep consideration in her mind, Lu Chorou decided for the time being.To alienate Ling Aotian.\u201cJuan\u2019er.\u201dShe shouted, and the door to the room was then opened, and Juan\u2019er walked in in a modest manner.She then instructed, \u201cYou entertain Mr. Ling, take him out.\u201d\u201cYes, Floor Master.\u201dJuan\u2019er answered, then smiled faintly at Ling Aotian. Her face couldn\u2019t help but blush.\u201cLing\u2026 Sir Ling, please follow me.\u201d????Just like that?Then why did you make the extra effort to call me up?Ling Aotian felt puzzled, and at the same time a little reluctant and unwilling:.\u201cFloor Master, why did you ask me to come up?\u201dLu Chorou softly replied, \u201cI heard that last night, Mr. Ling had to withdraw the marriage for Xue Qianjin even at the expense of offending the Wuyou Sect\u2019s Patriarch Jiang, such courage and heart really made me admire him.\u201dLing Aotian was delighted. The more he thought she might really be interested in him, he hurriedly pursued the question.\u201cSo you \u2026., the owner?\u201d\u201cSo I was just curious for a moment, Mr. Ling is really a talented man, Juan\u2019er send the guest away.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWith that, Ling Aotian could only follow Juan\u2019er out in depression.Lu Chorou got up and arrived at the window.Looking down from a height, she silently looked down at the busy landscape of the whole of Xue City.The warm sunlight sprinkled on her face and the fresh breeze mixed with the smoky smell of the city made her feel the reality of the world.\u201cWhether this is a fictional world or not.\u201d\u201cI am who I am, and as I live, I must live worthily.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t let tragedy happen, I can\u2019t let any harm come to Nishang.\u201d\u201cIf I want to completely change this tragic ending, I can\u2019t go on as the diary reads.\u201dShe flipped through the Private Diary of Jiang Mu. Her eyes flashed and a strong curiosity of interest rose in her heart.\u201cThis diary, Only I can see and touch it myself, so I guess it must be due to the power of the heavenly dao.\u201d\u201cHeavenly power cannot be revealed, does that mean that \u2026. Jiang Mu is the Chosen One?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of relationship would he and I, have?\u201d\u201cThe real him, what kind of person is he?\u201d\u201cWill he be better than Ling Aotian, the male protagonist,\u2026.?\u201d***Lihua Pavilion.\u201cDamn, those girls, how come they suddenly went home.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve even taken off all my clothes ahh.\u201dInside room number eight on the first floor.Jiang Mu, wearing only his trousers, was lying on the big red bed in a depressed manner, doing the \u2018little flying swallow\u2019 move.Just a moment ago.The pimp suddenly came in and told him that the four little girls had gone home on vacation to play.\u201cI was so looking forward to experiencing the Four best girls and I\u2019ve even thought of role plays,,, Ahh shit .\u201d\u201cBah, what a chicken pavilion, hurry up and close down.\u201d\u201cZero Rating.\u201dAs Jiang was cursing.

There was a sound of hitting steel.Xue Menghan\u2019s fist, completely smashed into Jiang Mu\u2019s waist.However \u2026.\u201cYah rah-!!!\u201dXue Menghan screamed out in pain.She felt a sharp pain coming from her waist.It was as if someone had slammed a fist against her waist, so hard that it almost broke her waist.She was in so much pain that her whole body slumped down on Jiang Mu\u2019s bare back.Couldn\u2019t get up for a while.\u201cFuck there\u2019s a ghost!\u201dJiang Mu felt something lying on his back and immediately rolled over in panic.Moreover, he felt something hit him on his waist.It was so painful.Luckily, his waist had been strengthened.Together with the \u2018body of pretending to take a beating\u2019, it canceled out 50% of the damage.Otherwise, his waist might have been broken on the spot.\u201d Damn it! Who the hell are you!\u201dJiang Mu had just rolled over.He saw a woman wearing a pig head mask, lying on top of his body.\u201cDamn it, that scared the shit out of me!\u201dJiang Mu angrily reached for the pig\u2019s head mask, wanting to see the woman\u2019s face clearly.Xue Menghan was greatly alarmed.She didn\u2019t care about the pain in her back and hurriedly grabbed Jiang Mu\u2019s hand.Jiang Mu stretched out his other hand to grab it, and she stretched out her other hand too.The result.Jiang Mu\u2019s hands, held firmly in her grasp, were still pinned above her head.The two of them were in the big red bed, just holding each other in an ambiguous and awkward position.Time passed.Neither of them spoke, just looking at each other eye to eye, the exhaled breath hitting both faces. Their heartbeats pounding against each other with regularity.It gave the two of them an indescribable and strange feeling.After a while.Jiang Mu had to speak to break the silence.\u201cGirl, why did you sneak up on me?\u201dWhile saying that, he struggled with his hands.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXue Menghan didn\u2019t answer. She was afraid that Jiang Mu would recognize her after hearing her voice.She also knew that this was the place to find pleasure.And this big red bed was also specially used for that.Now that they were alone, once Jiang Mu broke free, maybe she would be \u2026.Her heart tightened for a moment.So the hands that held Jiang Mu down became even harder.Jiang Mu struggled to no avail. His own strength was not at all as strong as hers, so he had to say.\u201cGirl, let go of me, I won\u2019t pursue it, really.\u201dJust kidding, I\u2019m definitely pursuing it! I\u2019m not going after you!I have no grudges, but you hit me at the waist?I\u2019ll have you as my waist tester later!\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXue Menghan still didn\u2019t dare to make a sound in response.\u201cEh? Girl, I think I\u2019ve seen you before, you\u2019re the one selling demon beast insurance?\u201dSince she was so close, Jiang Mu could feel her perfect figure in person.Coupled with her long emerald green soft dress, it was exactly the same as the woman he had met at the entrance before, the one selling demon beast insurance.\u201cTell me, why did you sneak up on me, we don\u2019t know each other, do we?\u201dJiang Mu continued to ask.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXue Menghan still didn\u2019t make a sound in reply.Her waist, now, hurt so much that it felt like it was about to break.She didn\u2019t understand at all how she had been injured!Was there someone else in the room, protecting him?She looked around the room nervously.Only to find.In the large room, apart from herself and Jiang Mu on the bed, there was no third person to be seen.What the hell?\u201cI said girl, are you dumb?\u201dJiang Mu was very annoyed.It was not enough to sneak up on him, but now she didn\u2019t even say anything back, and continued to look left and right?That was so fucking despicable!\u201cI see, I misunderstand you as a prostitute before \u2026. Is that why you wanted to get back at me?\u201dJiang Mu thought of this possibility.After all, a woman who worked hard honestly and was mistaken by someone as one who was in this business, I guess no one would be happy.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXue Menghan still didn\u2019t replyJiang Mu immediately became angry.I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s revenge, at least say something, what\u2019s the matter with grabbing me like this?I don\u2019t understand!He struggled to free his hands.Seeing this, Xue Menghan hurriedly tightened her grip on his hands so that he could not move.\u201cI say girl, it\u2019s indeed my fault for misunderstanding you, but I\u2019ve apologized and you\u2019ve sneaked up on me, so we\u2019re even, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dXue Menghan still didn\u2019t say anything back, and even increased her strength, holding him down to death.\u201cFuck, you forced me to do it!\u201dJiang Mu was too lazy to bleep anymore and kissed her directly towards her neck.Chu!\u201cAh\u2026!\u201dXue Menghan was so shocked her face paled.She desperately leaned back to avoid Jiang Mu\u2019s shameless act.However, how could this posture be avoided?And so.Chu Chu Chu!!!\u201cWoooooo~\u201dShe cried!And even though she cried, she didn\u2019t let go of the hands!\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYou\u2019re fucking kidding me.How do you make it sound like you\u2019re the victim?Hah, I am tired.Jiang Mu was depressed. It wasn\u2019t a good idea to keep going on like this.He had to stop talking and said helplessly.\u201cGo away, girl, and let\u2019s pretend nothing happened.\u201d\u201cWooooooo!\u201dWhat?Why are you crying now?\u201cDon\u2019t cry, you can go now, I\u2019m going home too.\u201dShit, crying is annoying.\u201cWooooooooooo!!\u201d\u201cOh woo? Trying to cry a louder?\u201dJiang Mu raised his mouth in a kissing gesture.\u201c~\u201dXue Menghan was so scared that she immediately stopped crying.But the trembling shoulders were a sign that she was still sobbing.Whatever, she loved to cry.Jiang Mu also had no other recourse.To be honest, he was a bit helpless when it came to the girls\u2019 crying.As a good young man with a positive outlook on the new century, although he was playing the villain here.But he really wanted him to do something indescribable to this girl who worked hard honestly as a punishment.He asked himself if he could do it.He can\u2019t, but he\u2019s a man with a lot of energy.And a man in his trousers.A man with an inch of abs on display.A man whose waist had been strengthened.Down there\u2026In short, just manly!\u201cKyaaaa\u2026!!!\u201dXue Menghan screamed as her whole body bounced up and fled Jiang Mu\u2019s body like a scared-off rabbit, like lightning.Eventually, in shame and anger, she walked out of the room, holding her waist.Only Jiang Mu was left alone, lying on the big red bed.\u201cBad luck!\u201d\u201cHow else am I going to get back to the sect like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way out.\u201d\u201cHah, I can only wait.\u201dJiang Mu was ready to call the pimp for a while.The result was that he hadn\u2019t even opened his mouth.He saw the pimp open the door and Xue Menghan, rushing out with her twisted hips.As soon as the pimp saw Jiang Mu\u2019s change, her heart protruded violently and her eyes went wide.Oh my goodness!It turned out that Miss Xue\u2019s search for Master Jiang was a lie, but her search for pleasure was the real thing!What a surprise!Yesterday she had just come of age and today she was out with a man.And with \u2026.

How they wailed and how helpless they were, and how rampant and cruel the murderers were.His heart ached for the murderer to be cut into pieces!Now, at last, he has the chance to kill his enemy with his own hands!He would share this good news with Xue Menghan!\u201cMeng Han, let me tell you\u2026\u201d\u201cAh!

I don\u2019t know what.So he went up curiously and asked with a smile.\u201cMenghan, what are you doing?\u201dXue Menghan did not respond.Because she was concentrating on her diary.[March 7, sunny.][Today, Ding Nanrong is as sexy as ever, making me feast my eyes on her.]But why did she suddenly pinch my waist a few times?][It almost made me laugh.

I persisted, and then Ling Aotian stepped in.][Then I clashed with Ling Aotian, and as a result, I was given a good beating by him and ended up running away like a dog in distress.[Well, that\u2019s probably how today will go.]High above the clouds.A small jet-propelled private airship was flying at high speed in the direction of the Demon Beast Mountain Range.This private airship was equivalent to a smaller version of the one in Xue Cheng.It was ship-like, without sails, and its hull was made of wood and iron, while huge crystals for jetting were embedded at the bow, stern and bottom of the ship.Inside the large ship, Jiang Mu and Ding Nanrong were the only two people inside.Ding Nanrong was at the controls of the ship in the cockpit, while Jiang Mu was in his luxurious room, taking a bath and writing in his diary.\u201cWhat kind of reward will there be today?\u201dJiang Mu closed his diary.[Ding, congratulations to the master, for successful diary writing.][Temperament +1][Face value +1][Reward obtained: The body that bears all poisons.][Reward introduction: Master is poisonous.][\u2460When infested with poison, it will automatically condense the poison into a \u2018Poison Pill\u2019.][\u2461Can expel the Poison Pill at any time to trigger a Poison Explosion.][\u2462Can actively absorb poison.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Atomic Bomb level Poison Pill \u2026.\u201d\u201d Hehe! It\u2019s terrifying to think about!\u201dAt this time, the airship began to descend and Jiang Mu felt a slight feeling of weightlessness.\u201d Hmm, we\u2019re almost at the Demon Beast Mountain Range.\u201dThen he got up from the bathtub and put on his jade white, handsome patriarch\u2019s robe.Get ready for the second main storyline: the hunting season.\u2026Demon Beast Mountain Range, outer mountain forest.\u201cDeath to the pig-headed!\u201dAn angry, delicate cry.Xue Menghan used her sword to thrust a large black-tusked wild boar, alive, to death.Then she drew her sword and headed straight for the depths of the mountain forest, with the five guards of the City Lord\u2019s residence following close behind.As for Ling Aotian at the back.He used his dagger to break open the black-tusked boar\u2019s skull to see if there was a demon core inside.It turned out that there was indeed one.\u201cMenghan, it\u2019s a demon core, don\u2019t you want it?\u201dLing Aotian happily held up a dark red crystal, the size of an egg, which was cold in his hand.\u201cNo! You are not allowed to follow me!\u201dXue Menghan dropped an irritated remark and continued to walk deeper without looking back.The more she thought about it, the angrier she became.\u201cDamn Jiang Mu!\u201d\u201cHow dare you treat me like a graveyard and cry for mercy?\u201d\u201cIf you dare to come later, I\u2019ll make you cry!\u201dAs she walked, she picked the trees that were good-looking and cut them off fiercely as if they were Jiang Mu.Seeing this, Ling Aotian laughed helplessly.\u201cIt seems that she is not satisfied with Lord\u2019s arrangement.\u201dHe knew the reason why Xue Menghan was angry.It was because just a moment ago on the airship, Xue Menghan had said that she wanted to have a solo hunting adventure by herself. but City Lord Xue had objected and arranged for him, Ling Aotian, to accompany her, saying that they would have a lookout for each other.\u201cWith her rebellious nature, that\u2019s why she\u2019s been angry until now, I guess.\u201dLaughing and shaking his head, Ling Aotian put the demon nucleus away in his Soul Ring and said to it.\u201cMaster, this demon core, you can absorb it, it\u2019s a little bit to recover a bit of strength.\u201d[Hmm.]In the nano-ring, a little girl\u2019s voice came out, hoarse with a bit of coldness, resembling a human and a snake.Ling Aotian gruffly said to the ring.\u201cMaster, I bought news from the Dark Night House.\u201d\u201cThe murderer who exterminated the Ling family village five years ago is a Spirit Devouring Sand Worm, and it\u2019s in the Demon Beast Mountain Range!\u201d\u201cThis Spirit Devouring Sand Worm has a very high cultivation realm, and the disciple is no match for it.\u201d\u201cBut the disciple must take revenge! Otherwise, the disciple may give birth to a heart demon, which will in turn affect cultivation!\u201d\u201cTherefore, I hope that Master can help the disciple!\u201dIn the ring, a little girl\u2019s voice, which sounded like a human and a snake, came out, hoarse and cold.[Your current cultivation level is only at the Spirit Gathering realm, if you use the demonic power of this god, I\u2019m afraid your body won\u2019t be able to withstand the backlash for a long time].Ling Aotian\u2019s face was resolute and overbearing.\u201d The disciple is not afraid!\u201d\u201cEven if my body dies, even if my soul flies away.\u201d\u201cDisciple, I will still take revenge and avenge!!!\u201d[Then go to hell.]\u201d Th-This \u2026.\u201dLing Aotian, who was so domineering one moment, was like being poured down with cold water the next moment, speechless, and embarrassed:.\u201cMaster \u2026. The disciple is only speaking to express his feelings of revenge \u2026.\u201d[Don\u2019t talk nonsense.][It\u2019s okay to help you, but once you\u2019re defeated, retreat immediately and don\u2019t linger on the battle.]\u201cYes, Master!\u201dLing Aotian regained his resolute face.[But since you want revenge, that girl called Xue Menghan, leave her alone, silly love will only lead to becoming a burden on you.]\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Master, I will only accompany her today.\u201d\u201cBecause City Lord Xue has told me, that Jiang Mu, who is also attending the hunting season today, will also be sure to stalk Menghan.\u201d\u201cSo, Lord Xue City wants me to protect Menghan.\u201d\u201cAfter all, Jiang Mu was humiliated by the withdrawal of his marriage and will probably do something crazy to Menghan.\u201d[Jiang Mu\u2026.]\u201cYes, a dandy and arrogant incompetent patriarch.\u201d\u201d Menghan is the woman that I, Ling Aotian, am determined to win, if he dares to touch a single hair on Menghan\u2019s head, I will cut him into pieces!\u201d[Jiang Mu cannot be killed!]\u201cFor\u2026 Why?\u201dLing Aotian was amazed.From his Master\u2019s tone, he heard a strong sense of importance.Why would Master value Jiang Mu?[There is no reason, don\u2019t ask.]\u201cSo what if \u2026. He really hurt Menghan \u2026.\u201d[Even if he took Xue Menghan\u2019s virginity, he must not be killed.]\u201cThat \u2026\u2026\u201dLing Aotian felt a choking sensation in his chest.He did not believe that his ruthless master was joking, so he had to say back in a depressed voice.\u201cDisciple\u2026 Understood.\u201dAlthough he didn\u2019t know why his master had commanded this.But seriously, think about it.All along, Master had never harmed him.If Master didn\u2019t say why, she must have her reason!Maybe it\u2019s to protect me \u2026. (T/N: What a hypocrite. Talking about it as if he owns it all.)After he thought about it, Ling Aotian felt much better.Using his dagger, he cut open the skin, flesh and bones of the black-toothed wild boar and put them into his other Nano Soul Ring.He worked for a while before chasing up in Xue Menghan\u2019s direction.***Inside the Demon Beast Mountain Range, in the middle of the open forest, there was a private airship parked.On the deck of the airship.Jiang Mu sat in a wooden wheelchair, staring worriedly at the woods ahead.\u201cIt\u2019s strange.\u201d\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Xue Menghan come out of the woods yet?\u201d\u201cAccording to the plot, by this time, she should have come out with five guards, ah.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not too early, am I?\u201dJiang Mu pondered hard, unable to figure it out.He had calculated the right time.In the original plot, he would have met Xue Menghan on his private airship when he had just landed in the Demon Beast Mountain Range.But now five minutes had passed.There was no sign of Xue Menghan either.Suddenly.Deep in the forest, a young girl\u2019s panicked scream was heard.\u201cHelp! Ah! No!!!\u201d?????Why would someone scream for help?That wasn\u2019t part of the original plot!And that voice\u2026 How come it sounded so much like Xue Menghan\u2019s?It couldn\u2019t really be her, could it?Jiang Mu\u2019s heart grew even more worried and he hurriedly instructed Ding Nanrong next to him.\u201cRong\u2019er, someone is shouting for help, push me to check it out!\u201dAs he didn\u2019t understand what was going on and was afraid that it might affect the main plot, he had to go and check it out himself.Ding Nanrong glanced faintly at Jiang Mu, knowing that he was faking being in a wheelchair and was just putting on an act.But she didn\u2019t provoke it either.She was curious how Jiang Mu ended up kneeling to Xue Menghan, and was taught a lesson by Ling Aotian\u2019s beating face.So, walking up behind him, she grabbed the wheelchair with her hand and leapt off the airship with him in tow.Then, pushing him, she quickly headed deeper into the forest.Soon.The duo arrived at the lake.\u201cHelp!!!\u201dAnother shrill cry for help from a young girl came from ahead.\u201cCrap nigga!\u201dJiang Mu\u2019s eyes nearly fell out of his sockets.He was so shocked by the scene at the lake in front of him that he wanted to split on the spot!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 - How did the plot twist like this!What did Jiang Mu see?He saw a lush, fiery red giant tree, mushroom-like, flailing, and waving its roiling branches at the edge of the lake ahead.These branches carried poisonous thorns and were wrapping around five withered male dry bodies, and a young girl who was still alive.This young girl.Yes, it was none other than Xue Menghan!She was hanging upside down, her long flowery green skirt flipped over, revealing her white legs. The skin on her legs was cut by the twisted branches and strangled, and blood was trickling out.\u201cF*ck! What the hell is going on! How did Xue Menghan meet the Blood Poison Tree Demon!\u201dJiang Mu\u2019s scalp simply tingled and he panicked.He was panicking not because of how powerful this Blood Poison Tree Demon was.Rather, it was because.In the original storyline.The one who encountered the Blood Poison Tree Demon was not Xue Menghan, but Ling Aotian!This Blood Poison Tree Demon, although the toxin was extremely vicious and strong, it never actively attacked humans and had always thrived peacefully, never being exposed, and only Ling Aotian\u2019s master could discover it.Moreover, Ling Aotian would follow the trail through the Blood Poison Tree Demon and eventually feel for the enemy behind the destruction of the village.And Xue Menghan, the heroine, would never have touched the Blood Poison Tree Demon at all!\u201cJiang Mu save me! Oooooh!\u201dAs soon as Xue Menghan saw Jiang Mu, it was as if she had seen her savior, and she let out a cry on the spot.She regretted that she shouldn\u2019t have cut down the tree recklessly.At that time, she had been cutting down trees all the way to vent her anger.When she passed by the lake, she saw such a huge, lush, fiery red tree and chopped it down indiscriminately to vent her anger.Only to find out that it was a blood poisoning tree demon.Five of his own guards were caught off guard and were instantly entangled and bound by its branches.Now, the guards had all been sucked out to dry flesh and blood.And herself, she was next!\u201cJiang Mu help me! You hurry ah woo woo!\u201dXue Menghan cried out for help one after another, and Jiang Mu made a split-second decision and instructed Ding Nanrong.\u201cRong\u2019er, save her! And don\u2019t kill the tree demon!\u201dEven before the words were out of her mouth, Ding Nanrong had already rushed out.When the blood poison tree demon saw another attacker, it flung dozens of branches with poisonous thorns at the attacker.Ding Nanrong\u2019s figure was like a phantom, dodging left and right, effortlessly dodging the branches and reaching the tree demon in an instant.She took out a Water Lotus Sword from her ring.The Water Lotus Sword gently slashed horizontally.It was just such a light slash.The tree demon, which had been slashed by Xue Menghan more than ten times, was cut off by Ding Nanrong on the spot and fell in half with a bang.\u201cThis old virgin, worthy of her cultivation level at the Returned Origin realm, she\u2019s really outrageously strong!\u201dJiang Mu sighed at the strength of Ding Nanrong.Having reincarnated over seventy times, he had long known the cultivation system of this world, like the back of his hand.There were six cultivation realms for the human race: the Spirit Gathering Realm, the Qi Sea Realm, the Returning Origin Realm, the Void Refining Realm, the Empty Meditation Realm, and the Martial God Realm.The cultivation realms of the demon race also have six: the Enlightenment Realm, the Tong Zhi Realm, the Transformation Realm, the Void Refining Realm, the Empty Meditation Realm, and the Demon God Realm.The cultivation realms of the human race correspond to those of the demon race one by one.This Blood Poison Tree Demon\u2019s cultivation level is the first realm, the Enlightened Light Realm.It was equivalent to the first realm of the human race, the Spirit Gathering Realm.Only.At the same realm, the demon race was generally much stronger than the human race.What\u2019s more.This Blood Poison Tree Demon, the branches of the tree could not only absorb the spiritual energy in a human\u2019s body, but also carried toxins.It was no wonder that only Xue Menghan, who was at the Spirit Gathering realm, and the five guards would suffer.\u201cAh!\u201dXue Menghan cried out in horror.After she lost the tree demon\u2019s restraint, she fell headfirst from a high altitude.If it was any other time, she would have been able to land steadily by changing her position in the air.Now, however, her legs had been poisoned and she was completely paralyzed, unable to move and unable to turn over.If she landed on her head, she would probably be half-crippled.\u201cRong\u2019er, catch her!\u201dJiang Mu shouted anxiously to Ding Nanrong.But Ding Nanrong turned a deaf ear.After cutting down the tree demon, she walked back slowly.Damn this old virgin, how dare she disobey me, I\u2019ll make you suffer later!Jiang Mu was indignant and helpless.As for orders from her patriarch, Ding Nanrong, who was his personal attendant, listened to them as she saw fit.That is to say, she would carry them out if she wanted to, or not if she didn\u2019t want to.There was no other way.Jiang Mu had no choice but to stand up from his wheelchair, manipulate his spiritual powers, and quickly run over there.\u201cBastard save me!!!\u201dXue Menghan, who was crying out in panic, cried louder when she saw Jiang Mu running.Save my ass!What a nuisance you are!Jiang Mu cursed.You\u2019re a good heroine, and you\u2019re here messing with a blood poison tree demon for no reason!Can\u2019t you just follow the plot?What a disaster!At the moment when Xue Menghan\u2019s head was about to fall to the ground.Jiang Mu caught her with one hand around her waist and one hand around her legs.Because of the position, a series of words came to Jiang Mu\u2019s mind: light green, thin silk, embroidered with the word \u2018dream\u2019, shallow concave seams \u2026\u2026Shaking his head off.Jiang Mu slowly lowered her to the ground.\u201cJiang Mu I can\u2019t feel my legs woooooooooooooooo!\u201dXue Menghan, who was lying down, felt that only the upper half of her body could move.Her originally smooth and white legs had now become riddled with holes, bleeding and sensations due to being pierced by the poisonous thorns of the tree branches.\u201cJiangmu am I crippled wooooooo! I don\u2019t want to be in a wheelchair woo woo woo!\u201dShe clung to Jiang Mu\u2019s arm, crying like a helpless, weak kitten, completely devoid of her usual Miss Qianjin\u2019s stance look.Looking at her bloody legs.Jiang Mu\u2019s expression turned gloomy.He remembered that the blood poisoning tree demon\u2019s toxin would first paralyze the body\u2019s nerves, and then turn the flesh and blood into thick water.If not treated as soon as possible, Xue Menghan\u2019s legs would definitely be ruined.\u201cRong\u2019er, find the antidote quickly!\u201dJiang Mu hurriedly instructed Ding Nanrong.But Ding Nanrong instead of doing as she was told, looked at the bloody holes in Xue Menghan\u2019s legs that were slowly starting to turn black, and said coldly instead.\u201cThe poison has entered the marrow, there is no cure, cut them.\u201d\u201cNo! I don\u2019t want to cut it! Jiang Mu, save me! I can\u2019t live without my legs!\u201dAs soon as Xue Menghan heard that her legs were going to be cut off, she cried out in terror and pain, and her face turned horribly pale.As a young girl of sixteen, as the number one beauty in Xue City.If she didn\u2019t have her legs, she might as well die!Hearing her say suicide, Jiang Mu panicked even more.What kind of a bizarre development is this?If the heroine was going to die, then what was the point of following the main plot line!Damn it!What the hell is wrong with the plot?What to do \u2026. how should I do \u2026.For a while, Jiang Mu\u2019s mind was so chaotic.What Ding Nanrong said was right.Xue Menghan\u2019s legs, which had been poisoned into the marrow, would sooner or later turn into thick water from the blood and flesh.And after that, if the legs were not removed, the toxin would slowly extend to the whole body, and would turn the flesh and blood of the whole body into thick water as well.Eventually.In the end, she would turn into a withered, dry corpse!For the first time, Jiang Mu felt helpless to do anything.The only thing he could do now was ease the spread of the toxin.With a bitter smile, he said to Ding Nanrong.\u201cRong\u2019er, anything, bring out all the pills that can ease the toxin \u2026.\u201dWait!Toxin???Jiang Mu suddenly felt like he was forgetting something important.It was only then that he suddenly remembered the reward he had received when writing in his diary today.[The Body That Bears All Poisons][Introduction: Master is poisonous][\u2460When the body is infested with poison. It will automatically condense the poison into a \u2018Poison Pill\u2019][\u2461Can expel the Poison Pill at any time to trigger a poison explosion.][\u2462Can actively absorb poison.]Can actively absorb poison!God, why didn\u2019t I think of this!The introduction of the third point.It gave Jiang Mu a glimpse of hope.After all, it was the dog system that produced. It was definitely a fine product.He believed that he would be able to cure Xue Menghan\u2019s legs.But before healing, it was better to follow the original plot and lick Xue Menghan for a while.So with a look of worry on his face, he said to Xue Menghan with deep emotion\u201cMenghan.\u201cIf your legs are ruined, I will become your legs.\u201d\u201cI will carry you on my back, tread the sand you like to tread, kick the grass you like to kick, and go to every place you want to go.\u201d\u201cAnd if you die, I will die with you.\u201d\u201cSo please, please, don\u2019t withdraw from the marriage.\u201d\u201cI really do love you!\u201dAfter the performance, he waited for Xue Menghan\u2019s response with an expectant face.\u201cWooooooooooo!!!\u201dWhat the hell!Shit, this plot can\u2019t go on.Xue Menghan kept crying, making it impossible for Jiang Mu to follow the original plot.Forget it, now, he should only help her leg to get rid of the poison.\u201cMenghan, don\u2019t be afraid, I\u2019ll help you get rid of the poison right now!\u201dSaying that, he directly grabbed one of her bloody legs.He then raised his mouth to a blackened, bloody hole in the calf.Amidst Xue Menghan\u2019s desperate cries, and Ding Nanrong\u2019s curious gaze.Stared sucking them, hard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Don\u2019t worry, I will definitely make Menghan happy!\u201dJiang Mu gave her a comforting smile.Then, one by one, he sucked the other blackened blood holes in her legs.And so it went.After sucking all the blackened blood holes on Xue Menghan\u2019s two calves.Xue Menghan could clearly feel a painful sensation from her lower legs.\u201d I can feel something! Jiang Mu I can feel my legs wooooooooooooo!\u201dShe was so happy that she cried again, like an innocent little girl who had lost and found something.Next to her, Ding Nanrong was amazed.She also couldn\u2019t understand it.It was logical.The poison had entered the bone marrow, which almost meant it was hopeless.But Jiang Mu had sucked the toxin out with his mouth?And he himself did not seem to be affected by the toxin.Could it be.Does he have a secret unknown to everyone in his body?I\u2019ll have to check his body when we return.\u201cRong\u2019er, give me medicinal ointment, the kind of top quality ointment that heals wounds.\u201dJiang Mu wiped the blood from the side of his mouth and said to Ding Nanrong.Ding Nanrong took out a white jade bottle with medicinal liquid from her Nascent Ring and handed it to him.By the way, she lightly reminded him.\u201d On her thigh, there\u2019s still a wound.\u201dThere was still a thigh?Without another word, Jiang Mu directly lifted Xue Menghan\u2019s flowery green skirt.Then he grabbed her thigh and scanned it carefully, seriously, up and down, 360 degrees, more than ten times.Just to see clearly the condition of the wound on her thigh.Xue Menghan covered it with her hand in panic, ashamed, and indignant: \u201cRascal!\u201cRascal! You, you don\u2019t look!\u201dDo you think I want to see it?How can I suck you if I don\u2019t look!Damn it!Jiang Mu cursed in his heart.On the surface, however, feigning a concerned and heartbroken expression.\u201d Menghan, bear with me, I\u2019ll suck up the last of the toxin now, I\u2019ll definitely cure you!\u201dAfter the act, he didn\u2019t bother to pay attention to her screaming objections.Just then.A furious yell came from the forest in the distance.\u201cBastard! What are you doing to Menghan! Let her go!\u201dA black shadow sprang out of the forest and headed straight for Jiang Mu\u2019s trio\u2019s position.\u201cRong\u2019er, block him first!\u201dJiang Mu didn\u2019t stop and continued to bury his head inside her skirt and suck on them. (T/N: Would\u00a0)He heard it out. The voice was Ling Aotian\u2019s.As the male protagonist, Ling Aotian saw Xue Menghan, the female protagonist, being fooled by the villain like this.Why wouldn\u2019t he run away on the spot?If Ling Aotian rampaged, here, only Ding Nanrong would be able to hold him back.After all, Ling Aotian had a golden finger.That is, that Demon God realm master of his own.Ding Nanrong took two steps forward, her body surging with spiritual energy and her skirt hair swirling slightly.Her gaze was indifferent as she looked at Ling Aotian, who was coming at them furiously.Just when the two sides were nearly ten meters apart.Boom!An invisible yet powerful oppression emanated from Ding Nanrong\u2019s abdominal dantian, crushing towards Ling Aotian like a mountain overturning the sea.\u201cPoof!\u201dLing Aotian was pressured to the point where he spat out a mouthful of blood and fell to his knees on the spot.The powerful oppression was so overwhelming that he could no longer advance a single bit!He looked up with difficulty.It was as if what stood in front of him was not Ding Nanrong, but an imposing mountain!That mountain-like mighty pressure was emanating from none other than Ding Nanrong!\u201cThis is\u2026 Spiritual pressure!\u201dLing Aotian was astounded.Spiritual pressure, could suppress the spiritual power of others, making it difficult for one to cast spiritual arts and immobilize.Spiritual pressure, only when one\u2019s cultivation level has reached the Returned Origin realm, can they possess it!With his current cultivation level at the Spirit Gathering Realm, he was unable to resist Ding Nanrong\u2019s powerful spirit pressure!\u201cMaster! I\u2026 Need strength!!!\u201dLing Aotian, who was kneeling, nearly roared up.In his mind, however, came the hoarse, cold voice of a little girl.[Dumbass, look at Xue Menghan\u2019s leg first.]Menghan\u2019s leg?Ling Aotian\u2019s gaze passed over Ding Nanrong and looked at Xue Menghan, who was lying and crying.Her calves were covered in blood, with white mucus covering them in multiple places.\u201cMaster, this is?\u201d[There is a Blood Poison Demon Tree by the lake, so I think, Xue Menghan was infested with the tree demon\u2019s poison.][And Jiang Mu, should be saving her.]What!Menghan was poisoned?The Blood Poison Demon Tree?Ling Aotian\u2019s complexion changed greatly.He turned his head to look at the edge of the lake.There was a huge fiery red tree that had been split in two, with countless branches filled with poisonous thorns.There were also five withered and dried corpses on the ground, which were Xue Menghan\u2019s guards.He turned back to Jiang Mu, who was buried under Xue Menghan\u2019s skirt, not knowing what he was doing.The anger in his eyes gradually flared up and he secretly swore.\u201cI hope he\u2019s really saving Menghan! Otherwise, I will definitely kill him with my hands!\u201dWith difficulty, he stood up and jumped back with all his might, away from Ding Nanrong\u2019s spiritual pressure.Seeing this, Ding Nanrong then withdrew her spiritual pressure.At the same time, she evaluated Ling Aotian in her mind.\u201cTo resist my spiritual pressure with just the cultivation level of the Spirit Gathering Realm, this male protagonist is indeed extraordinary.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t help but glance back at Jiang Mu, who was lying on the ground, her face showing an odd expression.\u201cIf it were this guy instead, he would probably be crushed to death straight away.\u201dAt this moment, Jiang Mu was already finished.He put his arm around Xue Menghan\u2019s waist, put her hand over his shoulder, and slowly lifted her up.\u201cMenghan, try to stand up.\u201dXue Menghan wiped away her tears and slowly stood up nervously.She felt her legs, weak and aching.But because the tree demon\u2019s poison had all been absorbed by Jiang Mu.So apart from the weakness and pain, there was no more blood loss.There was no longer any abnormality.\u201d It is fine! Jiang Mu my leg is better woooooooooo!\u201dXue Menghan hugged Jiang Mu and cried out happily.This scared Jiang Mu to death.Shit!You\u2019re the heroine, and here you\u2019re hugging a villain!That is even in front of the male lead himself!And with you like this, how am I supposed to continue playing the licking dog. How am I supposed to play a villain and to let Ling Aotian teach me a lesson, and how am I supposed to run away like a dog in distress!The plot is not going anywhere!Jiang Mu hurriedly tried to push Xue Menghan away.However, he couldn\u2019t. His own strength was not as strong as hers.\u201cMenghan, that, Ling Aotian is coming for you, you should go back to the airship with him quickly.\u201d\u201cWooooooooo!!!\u201dWhat the hell are you whimpering for!Jiang Mu\u2019s heart was burning with anxiety.Damn, this Xue Menghan persona, it must be crooked!She was already a bit off from the previous withdrawal episode!Jiang Mu struggled while looking ahead at Ling Aotian in the distance.Silently praying in his heart.I hope Ling Aotian, the male lead, will follow the plot and come over to beat me up\u2026.At this moment, Ling Aotian\u2019s fists were clenched and his gaze contained fire.He really wanted to rush over and rip Jiang Mu away from Xue Meng Han\u2019s soft arms and beat him to death again.But Jiang Mu had indeed saved Xue Menghan.If he were to attack him, I was afraid that he would be talked down to.Ling Aotian took a deep breath and tried his best to calm his emotions.He looked at the two of them, who were hugging each other, and held back his anger, saying in as calm a tone as possible.\u201cPatriarch Jiang, thank you for saving Menghan, now, could you please let go of her.\u201dBloody hell?The male lead didn\u2019t get mad?I had skin-to-skin contact with the heroine right in front of you!Instead of coming over and beating me up, you\u2019re thanking me, the villain?No! He had to stand up for himself.In order to advance the plot and to have Ling Aotian beat himself up.Jiang Mu decided to sacrifice his sexuality!He cupped Xue Menghan\u2019s pretty face with his hands.Then.Under Ling Aotian\u2019s bad premonition.Under Ding Nanrong\u2019s curious gaze.Under Xue Menghan\u2019s dumbfounded look.Chu\u2013uuu!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My apprentice will control the amount of snake poison, at most, I will only poison his hands!\u201d\u201cApprentice will make the one surnamed Jiang, pay the price of blaspheming Menghan!\u201dDamn it!This male protagonist is going to cripple me, right!Looking at the two black water snakes with golden pupils on Ling Aotian\u2019s arms, Jiang Mu was startled.He was aware of this spiritual technique.Snake God Poison Water Fist.This was the spirit art Ling Aotian\u2019s Demon God realm master had taught him.The toxin contained in that dark, golden-pupiled water snake was extremely strong, and only a small amount was needed to poison a person to the point of half-death.This vicious spirit art was one of Ling Aotian\u2019s trump cards.It was just unexpected that it would be used on him; Jiang Mu.This was not part of the original plot!Jiang Mu\u2019s heart began to worry again.In the original plot, Ling Aotian had only beaten him up ruthlessly and never would have used this underhanded card at all.It must have been because Xue Menghan was crooked, which caused Ling Aotian to deviate as well, right?\u201cAhhhhhh\u201dLing Aotian roared as he charged like an arrow and swept towards Jiang Mu at extreme speed.There was no choice but to withdraw his thoughts and face him head on.Boom boom boom boom!!!The two attacked with their fists again, fist to fist.Eventually, with a bang, both fists clashed and the black snakes on Ling Aotian\u2019s arms managed to instantly wrap around Jiang Mu\u2019s arms.Immediately afterwards, the duo leapt away, each drawing back a few meters.\u201cWhat is this!\u201dJiang Mu looked at both arms in \u2018horror\u2019.The two black water snakes were wrapped around his arms in a deadly manner, and they also began to slowly seep into his skin through his sleeves.Eventually, the two black water snakes completely disappeared into his arms without a trace.\u201cMy handssss!\u201dJiang Mu still had a \u2018terrified\u2019 expression on his face.His hands slowly dropped down to his sides and began to tremble uncontrollably.\u201cBastard! What did you do to my hands!!!\u201dAlthough on the surface, Jiang Mui had an expression of rage and panic.But secretly.However, he was silently absorbing and refining the toxin from this black water snake and growing the Poison Explosion Pill within his dantian.Luckily alright\u2026.If it wasn\u2019t for \u2018The Body That Bears All Poisons\u2019, I\u2019m afraid these hands would have been destroyed for sure.Jiang Mu secretly signed in his heart that he\u2019s are all right.Ling Aotian laughed coldly as he stared at his hands that were trembling endlessly.\u201cSnake God Poison Water Fist, it\u2019s my secret technique, after being hit by this move, your arms, not only will you lose all mobility, it will also absorb and deplete the spiritual energy in your body while you cultivate, making your cultivation slow down several times!\u201d\u201cWhat! You \u2026. You vicious evil demon!\u201d\u201cEvil demon? If it weren\u2019t for the fact that you saved Menghan\u2019s life, I would have wanted to bury you to the ground! And now, the loss of your hands is the price for your blasphemy against Menghan!\u201d\u201cQuickly bring the antidote to this patriarch!\u201dJiang Mu was so \u2018scared\u2019 that his body was shaking.That\u2019s how it looked in Ding Nanrong\u2019s eyes, and it was unclear whether it was real fear or fake fear.She looked at Jiang Mu\u2019s trembling hands. Then at Xue Menghan, who was standing motionless next to her.Finally, she looked at Ling Aotian, who was smiling coldly on the opposite side.This should be what the diary said \u2026. second main plot now?Being curious, she proceeded to watch the drama.\u201cThe antidote is impossible to give you.\u201dLing Aotian looked at the discomfited Jiang Mu with great pleasure in his heart.He then said indifferently.\u201cMy Black Water Snake Poison, even a tiny amount, is enough to paralyse both your arms, but if you don\u2019t treat it in time, and if you use your spiritual power indiscriminately, it will be worse than just paralysis.\u201dThe reason he brought this point up.For one, it was because he could not push Jiang Mu too far. After all, there was still a Returned Origin realm Ding Nanrong around.Secondly, it was by giving Jiang Mu a glimmer of hope that he would focus on healing his hands and have no time to pester Xue Menghan.After all, in the next four days, he, Ling Aotian, would have to go alone to seek revenge on his enemies and would not be able to look after Xue Menghan.As expected, when Jiang Mu heard this, a ray of hope immediately flashed in his eyes and he hurriedly asked.\u201cWhat! Are you saying that it can be treated?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s up to you to believe it or not.\u201dLing Aotian sneered and spoke.\u201cI advise you not to participate in the hunting season, hurry back now and get rid of the poison treatment, if you take too long, I can\u2019t guarantee your arms \u2026.\u201dBefore he finished his sentence, Jiang Mu was like grabbing a life-saving straw, panicking and instructing Ding Nanrong, who was at the side, and said.\u201cRong\u2019er! Quickly, quickly send me back to the airship!\u201dAs he said that, he walked to his wheelchair and sat down, waiting for Ding Nanrong to come and push him back to his private airship.He didn\u2019t forget to drop the harsh words, \u201cLing Aotian, right? Next time, this patriarch will definitely kill you!\u201dIs that the end of it?Ding Nanrong felt a bit disappointed.Since there was no more drama to watch, she had no alternative but to go over and push Jiang Mu in the direction of the private airship and speedily swept back.\u201cMenghan, are you alright!\u201dAfter Jiang Mu and the two of them left, Ling Aotian went up to comfort Xue Menghan.Seeing her dazed look, his heart ached a little.\u201cMenghan, believe me, one day, I will cut off Jiang Mu\u2019s hands and feet and make him pay the price for kissing you!\u201d\u201cHe kissed me\u2026 How dare he\u2026\u201dXue Menghan was mumbling, not yet fully snapped out of her daze.Ling Aotian couldn\u2019t hear too clearly and asked a little louder. Menghan, what are you talking about?\u201d\u201cHuh? Nothing\u2026 Nothing, I\u2026 I\u2019m going back to the airship, Mr. Ling, don\u2019t send me off!\u201dXue Menghan, who had been dumbfounded for a long time, finally snapped out of it.She covered her red face with both hands as she galloped with long steps, hurrying in the direction of Xue Cheng\u2019s airship.\u201cMaster, Menghan, she\u2019s \u2026.\u201dLooking at Xue Menghan\u2019s panicked back, Ling Aotian was at a loss for words.[The dazed woman who is in heat]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLing Aotian was speechless.[Don\u2019t forget the business, you are here for revenge.][That blood poison tree demon by the lake, it\u2019s not dead. Go kill it and refine its poison to strengthen your poisonous water fist.]\u201c\u2026Yes!\u201d***Private airship, inside the luxurious room.\u201cRong\u2019er, you go out, I\u2019ll be alone.\u201dAfter Jiang Mu was wheeled into the room by Ding Nanrong, he sat in his wheelchair rubbing his temples and began to think hard.About today\u2019s episode.He had to sort it out and see if he could find out why the plot was going askew.Also, he had kissed Xue Menghan.This was Xue Menghan\u2019s first kiss!Although it was a matter of urgency and impatience at the time.But it could have led to a huge change in Xue Menghan\u2019s attitude towards himself, a huge change.In turn, it would affect later plot.\u201cYou\u2019re not applying medicine anymore?\u201dLooking at his hand that could already move, Ding Nanrong was quite curious in her heart.It seemed to be fake poisoning, then.He had cured Xue Menghan of the tree demon\u2019s poison with his mouth.And he himself does not seem to be affected by Ling Aotian\u2019s Black Water Snake Poison.Then.Then, he must be hiding be secrets unknown to anyone.\u201cNo i\u2026 Oh, I\u2019ll put it on myself later.\u201dJiang Mu immediately changed his tone and resumed his pretense of having trembling hands.Although his own hands were already fine.But Ding Nanrong was unaware of it.In her understanding, he, Jiang Mu, was a scumbag, and his hands were just poisoned. It was impossible for them to get better for no reason.\u201cYou will put it on yourself?\u201dLooking at his hands that were suddenly trembling non-stop, Ding Nanrong wanted to laugh out loud.It was a pretty good act.\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d Jiang Mu returned like he was in pain.\u201cWhere is the medicine?Ding Nanrong asked toyingly in follow-up.\u201cUh \u2026.\u201dWhat was wrong with her, where did she come up with so many words.\u201cOf course it\u2019s in the nano-ring. Get out. I need to get rid of the poison soon.\u201d Jiang Mu groaned and urged once again to get out.\u201cBut you\u2019re not wearing the nano ring, everything you own, even your underwear is here with me, so you\u2019re lying, why are you lying?\u201dDing Nanrong\u2019s beautiful eyes revealed the slightest trace of amusement.The more Jiang Mu concealed it, the more curious she became.She decided that she would definitely dig out his secret.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What\u2019s wrong?\u201dJiang Mu was a little shivering from her stare.\u201cNothing, don\u2019t bother me for the next two days.\u201dDing Nanrong put him down, turned around, and went out.Don\u2019t bother her for these two days?Why.Jiang Mu scratched his head in confusion.\u201cOh hell, I remembered!\u201dAfter thinking seriously for a while, he was enlightened.Why did she say not to bother her for the next two days?Because today.It happened to be the day when the Water Yuan Poison in her body would kick in!Ding Nanrong\u2019s physique was one of the Five Great Physiques: the Innate Yuan Body.A cultivator who had awakened the Innate Yuan Body would have elemental powers awakened in their body.The so-called elemental power is actually water, fire, thunder, ice, earth \u2026. and so on, the power of these elements.Ding Nanrong, on the other hand, has awakened the power of the water element.It was because of this water elemental power that she was a whole lot stronger than other cultivators of the same realm.But it was also because of this water elemental power that a permanent, inexorable poison had grown in her body: the water elemental poison.\u201cTsk, this water elemental poison is a natural cultivation tonic.\u201dJiang Mu sighed from the bottom of his heart.This Water Yuan Poison wasn\u2019t a deadly toxin.Instead, it was a good thing that could excite people and allow them to boost their cultivation.The only harm was that once it struck and was not relieved in time, there was a risk of falling into darkness.In lighter cases, one\u2019s cultivation will be compromised and one\u2019s realm will be stopped.In serious cases, cultivation will be lost and one will never be able to cultivate again.Why would Jiang Mu know this?That was because in later stories, Ding Nanrong herself said it to him.All this was an afterthought.Jiang Mu looked towards the next room.It was Ding Nanrong\u2019s bedroom, only a wall away from his room.\u201cShe should be bathing now, preparing for the onset of the water element poison, right?\u201d\u201cSince I can\u2019t disturb her for the next two days.\u201d\u201cThen I can go out and play alone.\u201dYes.This hunting season, for the rest of the time, Jiang Mu planned to sneak out and have fun.It wouldn\u2019t affect the main storyline anyway.Besides.If he had stayed in the airship for the past two days, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to hold it in if he had listened to the screams of the waves next door.\u201cBut the first order of priority is to sort out today\u2019s plot.\u201d\u201cSee if I can figure out why the plot is going off the story.\u201d\u2026Next door, inside the old-fashioned room.In the large bathroom.Ding Nanrong removed her skirt, coiled up her silky soft hair. Her long snow-white legs slipped into the tub, and with her hips and breasts up, she slowly lowered her delicate body.The bath water, covered with purple flower petals, overflowed like a waterfall.The dense aromatic vapor curled up from the surface of the water, filling the whole bathroom like a misty cloud, as if it were a deep mountain hot spring, making people feel calm and quiet.But at this moment, Ding Nanrong\u2019s heart was hardly calm.\u201cHis poison dispelling pill, I wonder if it can dispel the \u2026. Water Yuan Poison.\u201dDing Nanrong let out a low sigh with a sad frown.\u201cToday, it\u2019s the day when the Water Yuan Poison will act up.\u201dShe slowly reclined backwards, leaning the back of her head against the pillow on the side of the bath.Then she lifted one leg and hung it out of the tub.Then she lifts the other leg and hangs it out of the tub.With her hands on her stomach and wrists, she stares blankly at the ceiling.The aromatic bath water on the tips of her feet drops onto the floor, as time passes little by little.She, it seems, is waiting for something to come.I don\u2019t know how long it took.Ding Nanrong\u2019s milky white jade-like skin suddenly became even more crystal clear.\u201cIs it going to start? \u2026.\u201dAll over her body, a layer of transparent, lubricated mucus began to seep out.\u201cMmm~\u201dA muffled moan of uncontrollable emotion echoed throughout the bathroom.She bit her lips with her teeth, her crystalline toes clenched together, her hands gripping her white wrists tightly as she forced her body to hold back the strange discomfort.\u2026The next morning.The warm morning sun fell through the airship\u2019s windows on Jiang Mu\u2019s sleeping face.Suddenly, there was a long, high-pitched \u201cCackle\u2026!\u201d A sound came from the next room.It was unrelenting.\u201cThis old virgin, she\u2019s really noisy.\u201dJiang Mu woke up with his eyes rubbing.He had been woken up by Ding Nanrong\u2019s shouting.\u201cAll day and a night, that\u2019s gotta be tough.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s working so hard, shouldn\u2019t I, as the patriarch, go over and give her a little help?\u201dAlthough he said that, Jiang Mu didn\u2019t go over. He just got up and went to the bathroom to wash up a bit.There had been a reincarnation.Where he had been curious and barged into Ding Nanrong\u2019s room.He even ran into the bathroom and looked at her naked.The scene was erotic and he was instantly manly.Yet the result was bloody.He was beheaded by her with his eyes still glued to her sensual body, and died.In the following rounds, every time he broke into her room, he was either beheaded or shot in the head.So Jiang Mu never dared to barge in again.After washing up, he returned to the table and ate some breakfast as a matter of course.After yesterday\u2019s night of thinking, he had thought until his brain was about to explode.The result was that he still couldn\u2019t figure out why Xue Menghan and Ling Aotian were crooked.Asking the system didn\u2019t get any response either.\u201cForget it, now that the arrows have been shot out, it\u2019s useless to think any more.\u201d\u201cThe only thing I can do now is to ensure that the outcome of the plot doesn\u2019t deviate anymore.\u201dBased on the experience of the previous dozens of reincarnations.Jiang Mu knew very well.Even if the course of the plot was slightly different, as long as the result was the same, it would be fine.And the result of yesterday\u2019s episode.It was that Ling Aotian had stood up for Xue Menghan and taught himself a lesson, making it impossible for him to continue to participate in the hunting activities in the following days and continue to pester Xue Menghan.As for kissing Xue Menghan.It was no big deal.Because although it\u2019s a harem but clean as water.Not only is it Xue Menghan\u2019s first kiss, but up until the end, all the female leads are untouched.And as the female lead, Xue Menghan saw that he saved her legs, so it was fine if she wasn\u2019t a bit holy.\u201cWell, yesterday\u2019s episode is kind of done, so that\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no play for me today, so I can go out and relax.\u201d\u201cBy the way, a day\u2019s of memories is always worth writing in the morning.\u201d\u201cI need to write a diary first, let\u2019s see what good rewards we have today!\u201dJiang Mu summoned his diary.With great anticipation.Started writing today\u2019s diary.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could not wait to rush in and kill his enemy with his bare hands.It turned out.Yesterday, when he was refining the poison of that blood poison tree demon, his master had discovered the special mark on the tree demon: the Spirit Devouring Mark.The Spirit Devouring Mark, a unique mark of the Spirit Devouring Sand Worm Race, serves to absorb the spiritual energy of living beings.At that time, Xue Menghan\u2019s five guards had been absorbed by the Blood Poison Tree Demon using the Spirit Devouring Mark, and that was why all of them had fallen instantly.According to this Spirit Devouring Mark.Ling Aotian\u2019s master, then judged the location of the secret stronghold of the Sandworm Demon Army.And within this stronghold.It was likely that there was his Ling Aotian\u2019s enemy hiding: a Spirit Devouring Sand Worm of the Formation Realm named Sha Wuwen.\u201cMaster, Sha Wuwen\u2019s cultivation realm is the Formation Realm, which is equivalent to the Returning Element Realm for human cultivators.\u201d\u201cTherefore, please, Master, make sure to help the disciple!\u201d\u201cMaster?\u201dLing Ao Tian was a little strange.It was because the master did not respond to him.\u201cMaster daddy? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d[Don\u2019t make a noise.]\u201cYes!\u201dAlthough Ling Aotian wanted to rush into the stronghold immediately and kill his enemies who had exterminated the village by hand.However, he still held back the anger in his heart and continued to lurk.With his understanding of his master.Master must be making him a sure-fire, infallible plan to attack the stronghold!After all.The ruthless and cautious Master never fought a battle that she was not sure of!However, what Ling Aotian did not know was thatHis master.At this moment, inside the Ring, leisurely reading the diary.[That location, a secret stronghold set up by the Sandworm Demon Army, was specifically used to collect information on human cultivators to facilitate the attack on Xue City at a later stage].[Such a hidden stronghold was found by Ling Aotian. I have to say, he has a great master.][Well, today\u2019s main plot is that Ling Aotian destroys the demon army stronghold and starts a war with the stronghold\u2019s leader, Sha Wuwen, thus beginning the road of vengeance.][He had a powerful master. Otherwise, he would have been killed by a group of sandworm demon beasts before he even met Sha Wuwen.][Tsk, speaking of Ling Aotian\u2019s master, she is a long black hair, beautiful little loli.][Although she is a little loli, she has a dominating name. Her single name is Fury. Her full name is Black Water Fury and she is the clan leader of the Black Water Snake Clan.][Oh yeah, she\u2019s also the third female lead.]\u201cSo this god is really one of the main female characters!\u201dBlack Water Fury looked at the diary in her hand, feeling surprised but more excited.In fact, when she first saw the diary.She had suspected that someone was trying to conspire against her.And the first one she suspected of was her disciple, Ling Aotian!She wanted to kill Ling Aotian right then.After all, Ling Aotian was a human, while she was a demon.She knew very well in her heart.Currently, humans and the demon race were, on the surface, separated and at peace with each other.But in reality.The conflict between humans and the demon race had been intensified for tens of thousands of years, and now it had long since climax and was about to explode at any movement.And Ling Aotian was the so-called male protagonist.So how well would she, Black Water Fury, as the existence at the summit of the demon race, end up?Probably she would be eliminated by Ling Aotian, right?So without hesitation, she was ready to make her move to kill Ling Aotian.But the moment before she did so, she suddenly thought of one thing: as the master of the male protagonist, was it possible that she herself was also one of the female protagonists?So she waited patiently, slowly, for the diary to update.As it turned out, today she finally discovered it!She, Black Water Fury, was the third female protagonist after Xue Menghan and Lu Chorou!\u201cSince this god is the heroine, the ending must be very satisfying!\u201d\u201cAs long as this God follows the plot and makes good use of the male protagonist, Ling Aotian, then my flesh, in the end, will be successfully retrieved!\u201d\u201cThat beast that exterminated my Blackwater Serpent clan, this God will also, with her own hands, exterminate her clan!!!\u201dThe Black Water Serpent had good hopes for her ending.\u201cThat Jiang Mu, he has to stay alive well.\u201d\u201cIf he dies, this god will not be able to continue to peek into my own destiny through the diary.\u201dShe coiled her long, dark, thick snake tail, her upper half of her petite body leaning against the cool stone bed.A pair of small, tender white hands held the diary. Her large golden vertical pupils were blinking in anticipation of what was to follow.[This Black Water Fury, who is normally a human with a snake\u2019s tail, is a long, straight, black-haired loli when in human form.][But don\u2019t look at her as cute. She is the leader of the Black Water Snake clan, a demon cultivator who has lived for nearly a thousand years and is even a strong member of the Demon God realm.][She\u2019s very scary.]\u201cScary? Oh, foolish and weak human.\u201dThe Black Water Fury brushed her long, straight black hair.That childish and cute face revealed a disdainful yet pleased smile.[Her mind is a very poisonous one.]][Many times, the people Ling Aotian didn\u2019t want to kill were forced to be killed by her as the master.][And often taught Ling Aotian what \u2018mercy is the most ridiculous thing\u2019 and \u2018trust is the cheapest rubbish\u2019. \u201dCut the grass without getting rid of the roots, and the spring wind will blow again.\u201d]\u201cHe knows quite a lot about me.\u201d\u201cShall I turn him into a slave and keep him by this god\u2019s side forever.\u201dThe Black Water Fury narrowed his eyes, extended her long, forked tongue and \u2018sucked\u2019 and licked the diary.Then reading further down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why the sudden rage?The heart of Ling Aotian was raised to his throat, and he held his breath, not daring to ask any more questions.The master was unpredictable and was particularly prone to anger.If he said the wrong thing to displease her, he would definitely be in trouble.When the horrifying aura of spiritual pressure dissipated, Ling Aotian mustered the courage to ask.\u201cMaster\u2026 Master?\u201dThen, in his mind, an extremely ruthless, hoarse girl\u2019s voice was heard.[Enter the stronghold immediately! Kill Sha Wuwen!]\u201cBut there\u2019s still a group of \u2026. guarding the entrance to that cave.\u201dBefore he could finish his words, he was astonished to see it.The group of huge sand worm demonic beasts that were originally guarding the stronghold\u2019s cave entrance.At this moment, they had all been shocked to death and had tumbled to the ground east and west!So that was it!Master must have come up with a solid revenge plan for me.That\u2019s why she spared no effort to exert a powerful spiritual pressure to shake all the demon beasts in a few miles\u2019 radius to death.Thus giving me the opportunity to confront my enemy, Sha Wuwen, head-on!Worthy of being a master! Worthy of being a supreme existence of the Demon God realm!Ling Aotian\u2019s admiration for the Black Water Fury grew a few more points in his heart.He no longer hesitated and immediately rushed out of the stone crevice, heading straight for the demon beast stronghold ahead.\u2026[Ding, congratulations to the host, successful diary writing.][Temperament +1][Face Value +1][Reward obtained: Void Divine Concealment (Spiritual Art)][Description of Reward: Under invisibility, the master is a god. Can hide his body in the void, making it undetectable.][Note: In the state of invisibility, spiritual energy will be continuously consumed, and will be automatically lifted when spiritual energy is insufficient.]After the system voice.An arcane, colorless light disappeared into Jiang Mu\u2019s body.\u201cVoid Divine Concealment?\u201d\u201cIt sounds powerful.\u201dJiang Mu\u2019s mind moved and attempted to use Void Divine Concealment.In the next moment, his entire body became motionless, turning into a transparent state and disappearing into the void.It felt as if the entire person didn\u2019t exist at all.\u201cHoly moly!\u201d\u201cThis is a great way to escape and avoid danger!\u201d\u201cMoreover, you can also sneak up behind the enemy and play dirty tricks.\u201dJiang Mu beamed a cunning smile.This Void Divine Concealment could not only be used to escape.It could also be used to sneak up on enemies and play an unexpectedly strange trick.Although there were some diary rewards that he, as the villain, wouldn\u2019t always be able to use.But after passing the level.In addition to being able to choose any of the fictional characters to bring back to the real world.You can also bring back these diary rewards, along with them!Jiang Mu thought back on the rewards he had gained from writing his diary over the past few days.[Body of pretending to take a beating]: Master has always pretended to be a pussy and has never been killed. When attacked, counteracts 50% of the damage.[A Man of Steel Body]: No one is tougher than Master. When attacked, bounce 100% of the damage to the attack back to the opponent.[Godly Waist]: Your waist has been strengthened.[Body of Ten Thousand Poison Bearers]: Master is poisonous\u2460When infested with poison, it will automatically coalesce the poison into a \u2018Poison Explosion Pill\u2019.\u2461Can expel the Poison Explosion Pill at any time to trigger a Poison Explosion.\u2462Can actively absorb poison.[Void Divine Concealment]: Under concealment, the master is a god. Can hide his body in the void so that no one can detect it.\u2026\u201cDefense, attack, and assistance, all three.\u201d\u201cAnd I wonder what even more awesome rewards will come later.\u201d\u201cBut this Void God Concealment, the spiritual energy consumed is really fast.\u201dJiang Mu clearly felt that the spiritual energy in his body, was rapidly draining away.He had the intention of testing just how long the stealth state could last.So he tested it for 1 minute.When time was up, he lifted the Void God Concealment and his body returned from transparency.After checking some of the spiritual energy in his dantian.It was discovered that.For 1 minute of invisibility, the spiritual energy had been consumed by about 1%.According to this conversion, it would be fine to continuously maintain 1.5 hours.\u201cBut then again, this Void God Concealment came at a good time.\u201d\u201cI was just about to go out and play when the system gave me a stealth technique.\u201d\u201cWait, how about i go watch Ling Aotian\u2019s exciting revenge?\u201dJiang Mu suddenly had a new idea.For one thing, although he knew the plot, he had basically never seen Ling Aotian\u2019s revenge process with his own eyes, so he had always felt curious to see what the battle was like.Secondly, Ding Nanrong, the female partner, and Xue Menghan, the female lead. Their personas are all a bit crooked, so as one of the female leads, the Black Water Fury \u2026. Would her persona be crooked as well?Jiang Mu frowned pensively, very worried about the second point.I don\u2019t know why.Intuition told him that this third female lead, Black Water Fury, might really be changed as well!Then.It is very necessary to observe her!After all, she was also Ling Aotian\u2019s master and was directly related to the main storyline.\u201cLet\u2019s go to No Man\u2019s Canyon!\u201dJiang Mu decided to go and watch Ling Aotian\u2019s revenge process.Just as he was about to go out.A high pitched, long and shrill \u201ccluck-!\u201d A sound came from Ding Nanrong\u2019s room.It was long and unrelenting.\u201cOoh, I almost forgot about this old virgin.\u201d\u201cShould I go and have a look?\u201d\u201cForget it, there\u2019s no point in looking.\u201d\u201cAnd in case I get caught, it\u2019ll be the end.\u201dJiang Mu thought as he raised his feet and walked out of the room.Before he knew it.He arrived at the door of Ding Nanrong\u2019s room.Contemplating.\u201cWell \u2026.\u201d\u201cI as the patriarch and she as my personal maid.\u201d\u201cThen it is quite obligatory for me to go in and care if she is in trouble, right?\u201d\u201cMore importantly, although she is not the main female character, she is an important supporting female character, and once her persona is twisted to the point of no return, it will also affect the main storyline.\u201d\u201cAnd with my godly stealth, she as a Returned Element Realm can\u2019t discover me.\u201d\u201cSo, no matter what.\u201d\u201cI have to go in and check on her.\u201dFinishing his thoughts.Jiang Mu used Void Divine Concealment, allowing his body to turn transparent and blend into the void.Then, with a caring heart and a calm face, he quietly opened the door to the room.As he stepped into the room, he almost slipped to the bottom of his feet and nearly fell.\u201cThat was close! Almost forgot about the slime all over the place.\u201dThe floor was covered with transparent, nearly air-dried slime.This was what Ding Nanrong had drained out when the water element poison in her body had flared up.Jiang Mu moved carefully, step by step, towards the bathroom.As he approached the bathroom screen.He began to smell the intoxicating fragrance and heard the sound of the bath water tumbling and splashing.It was as if someone was shaking their hands back and forth in the water.Cautiously, Jiang Mu slipped behind the bathroom screen.Then, quietly, he reached out and peered inside the bathroom.Hiss!She is still as fierce as ever!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Forgot about the slime!He slipped and fell on all fours with a loud bang.The movement here jolted Ding Nanrong in the bath tub.\u201cWho!!!\u201dA powerful spiritual pressure burst out from her body.The spiritual pressure covered the entire room, pressing Jiang Mu in stealth with a pressure in his chest, almost choking him into unconsciousness.Fortunately, he had a \u2018body of pretending to be beaten\u2019, which canceled out 50% of the damage.Otherwise, he would probably have passed out on the spot, and that would have had really disastrous consequences.He just lay still on the ground, not daring to make a sound or move a bit.He intended to wait for Ding Nanrong to let her guard down and then leave.The next second.He then saw.Ding Nanrong, wrapped in a purple bathrobe, swept out with her Water Lotus Sword, standing barefoot in the middle of the room, looking around with a frosty face.She stood on guard for a long time.After not finding any suspicious signs, she frowned slightly.\u201cIs it an illusion?\u201d\u201cBut why do I feel a sense of oppression?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like\u2026 Someone is using the same intensity of spiritual energy \u2026.\u201d\u201d Is it because of the water element poison?\u201dShe couldn\u2019t understand it and just assumed it was the effect of the water element poison that had caused her nerves to become overly sensitive.So she undid the spiritual pressure and put the sword into her ring.Then returned to the bathroom and continued to ease the damn water element poison away.\u201cSplash!\u201d The sound of entering the water.Ding Nanrong was already back in the bath tub.Phew~Jiang Mu secretly breathed a sigh of relief.He hurriedly calmed his body and mind and took the opportunity to stand up.Regardless of his hands and feet, he moved smoothly to the door of the room.Quietly he left.As quietly as he had come.His heart was unruffled, and he breathed a fresh smell of the air and signed once again.***[Well, after some inspection, Ding Nanrong did not go overboard.][Her persona, too, is not crooked.]After leaving the private airship.Jiang Mu recorded his diary while doing so.While sweeping towards the direction of the unoccupied canyon.Another chapter later.!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why have you come out?\u201dLing Aotian, who was on guard, was astonished.In front of him, a little girl with a black dress, straight black hair and golden vertical pupils suddenly appeared in a flash.That was his master, Black Water Fury.As his master was in a state of soul without a physical body, she was relatively weak.Therefore, she was required to stay in the Soul Space for a long time to recuperate.So why would she come out?\u201cThis god has detected that Sha Wuwen is hiding a hundred metres underground.\u201dThe Black Water Fury\u2019s pair of golden vertical pupils looked at the ground beneath their feet.\u201cUnderground?!\u201dLing Aotian also looked down at his feet, his gaze flickering with excitement.In that case, was Master going to force the other party to come up personally?The Black Water Fury\u2019s skirt suddenly rises without wind.\u201cStay away from this hole, this god is going to dig this beast out.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dLing Aotian quickly withdrew from the cave.The next moment.A powerful aura of spiritual energy suddenly radiated out from the cave.The sky above the cave instantly became dark clouds rolling, and lightning flashed.\u201cBlack Snake Divine Thunder!\u201dAs a vicious little girl\u2019s voice rang out.A huge, black thunderbolt that resembled the descending of a snake god fell from the sky.Boom\u2013!!!The entire mountain was struck by the thunder serpent and exploded with a bang.The scene was like a volcanic eruption as boulders and mud splattered and spilled from the sky.In the end, the whole mountain was blown out into a huge crater, a hundred meters deep!Ling Aotian\u2019s heart and soul were shaken by the sight.How intense!The power of his master\u2019s \u2018Black Snake Divine Thunder\u2019 move had reached at least the Void Refining Realm!When the smoke and dust cleared away.He saw that a human-shaped demonic beast slowly sprang out from the low area within the pit.Its face resembled a human face, with two black tentacles growing from its forehead. Its body was covered in black insect armor. Its limbs slender in the shape of knuckles, and a pair of black protruding eyes looking towards Ling Aotian.\u201cFound you! Sha Wuwen!!!\u201dLing Aotian recognized at a glance that it was his arch enemy, the Spirit Devouring Sand Worm, Sha Wuwen!Before Ling Aotian could make a move.Sha Wuwen covered his abdomen and limped, running away in the opposite direction in terror.It looked as if he had been injured by the blast just now.\u201cBastard STAND STILL!!!\u201dSeeing the enemy who had wiped out the village fleeing, Ling Aotian chased after him full of madness.\u201cHe isn\u2019t really injured\u2026\u201dThe Black Water Fury tried to warn Ling Aotian, who had already chased him far away.However, the voice that came out was faint.Due to her use of powerful spirit arts, she had used up so much spirit power and soul power that she had become extremely weak.She had to have to meditate in place.At the same time, she set up a simple empty formation and deposited her divine sense within the empty formation, giving the formation the function of a divine sense, dedicated to detecting all movements around her.Next, she sat inside the formation and rested in peace.Meanwhile.The mouth of the valley of the No Man\u2019s Canyon.\u201cHoly crap?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t see it wrong, did I?\u201d\u201cWas that the Black Snake Divine Thunder just now??\u201dJiang Mu was dumbfounded on the spot.Having reincarnated dozens of times, he instantly recognized that the huge black thunder snake in the sky just now was the result of the Black Water Snake Clan\u2019s secret art.That was something only Black Water Fury could release!\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d\u201cDamn, this Black Water Fury is really crooked, isn\u2019t she!\u201d\u201cLook at this, she blew up the Sand Worm Clan\u2019s stronghold?!\u201d\u201cThat wasn\u2019t in the original plot!!!\u201dJiang Mu\u2019s heart was paralyzed.He had just seen that small mountain that hid the sandworm stronghold being instantly blown away by that huge thunder snake.Calm down, stay calm \u2026. He hurriedly calmed down and went through the original plot.In the original plot.Ling Aotian entered the stronghold and forcibly raised his cultivation level to the Returned Origin realm through the aid of the Black Water Fury\u2019s secret technique and defeated Sha Wuwen.As a result, Sha Wuwen used a forbidden technique and managed to escape while hanging on for dear life, eventually escaping back to the Southern Demon Domain.It was only because of Sha Wuwen\u2019s escape that this line of revenge was extended to the Ling Family Village, which in turn allowed Ling Aotian to follow the trail and eventually uncover a massive monster behind Sha Wuwen.And this is the one that Ling Aotian really wants to take revenge on!However, now \u2026.The plot has gone awry!Then Sha Wuwen shouldn\u2019t have been blown up straight away \u2026..Jiang Mu immediately used Void Divine Concealment, turning his body transparent into the void and running straight towards the stronghold.When he arrived at the edge of the huge sinkhole.The sight in front of him made the corners of his mouth twitch.\u201cWhat a mess!\u201d\u201cThe entire stronghold has been blown away by the roots, so that Sha Wuwen wouldn\u2019t have been blown into dregs?\u201dAhead of him was a huge sinkhole, a hundred meters deep and the size of a football stadium.Jiang Mu\u2019s heart chilled to the bone.Once Sha Wuwen really died through, then, the line of revenge that would follow Ling Aotian would be completely broken.In other words, the game had failed!But Jiang Mu still wished for a sliver of luck.He ran along the edge of the sinkhole to see if he could find Ling Aotian and Sha Wuwen.\u201cCrap?\u201d\u201cWhy is this bitch sitting there?\u201d\u201cShe didn\u2019t go back into Ling Ao Tian\u2019s ring?\u201dJiang Mu had run a small half lap when he saw, in a flash, a little loli with a black dress and black hair in front of him.The little loli was none other than Black Water Fury.She was meditating with her eyes closed, recuperating, and toning up.What about Ling Aotian?Jiang Mu hurriedly looked around the area, but there was no sign of Ling Aotian.Had he gone after Sha Wuwen?Hope sprang up in his heart.If that was the case, then there was still a chance for the plot to be re-written back to its original path!Should I go up and ask this bitch where Ling Aotian is?But she was ruthless and unpredictable. In case he said the wrong thing, he might be killed by her on the spot.Besides, I still had conflicts with Ling Aotian.According to this bitch\u2019s philosophy of \u2018cutting off the grass to get rid of the roots\u2019, she might really kill himself and be done with it.In that case, he would still fail!Jiang Mu was in a dilemma.But if he didn\u2019t go up and ask her!! He didn\u2019t know where Ling Aotian was, when would he have to find out?What to do?How to ask, or Should I not ask?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No way!\u201d\u201cThis bitch can sense me?!\u201dGoosebumps rose up all over Jiang Mu\u2019s body.This Void Divine Concealment that made him feel twice as safe\u2026 Could it have failed?And the Black Water Fury\u2019s following words told him the answer.\u201cA mere Spirit Gathering Realm mole, you also presume to use a stealthy spirit technique to hide from this God\u2019s divine sense?\u201dDivine Sense?A Void God cannot conceal his divine sense?WTF? It said, I\u2019m a god while using this skill.Just as a group of divine beasts ran through Jiang Mu\u2019s mind.Spatial ripples suddenly rose around the Black Water Fury.In the blink of an eye.Her entire body disappeared in place.In the next second, she appeared in front of Jiang Mu\u2019s face.She raised her petite arm and grabbed Jiang Mu\u2019s throat with precision.\u201cLet go let go! Cough cough cough \u2026.\u201dJiang Mu was on the verge of suffocating from the chokehold, his spiritual will gradually fading, and the spiritual energy in his body becoming disordered.And the Void Divine Concealment, as a result, was forcibly lifted.Eventually.He was completely, utterly exposed in front of the Black Water Fury!\u201cSo it\u2019s you! Bastard!!!\u201dThe Black Water Fury\u2019s pupils shrank furiously as anger rose from the bottom of her heart.She remembered clearly that Jiang had called her a bitch in his diary.If he hadn\u2019t called her a bitch.She wouldn\u2019t have lost control of her emotions and exploded her spiritual pressure to scare Sha Wuwen into hiding.Nor would she have been forced to spend her strength performing the \u2018Black Snake Divine Thunder\u2019 to dig Sha Wuwen out.Nor would he have allowed herself to become so weak and her power to drop to the first level of the Qi Sea realm!\u201cThe one who dared to call this god a bitch hasn\u2019t been born yet!\u201dThe Black Water Fury had wanted to utter such a phrase to Jiang Mu.Only to find that it was forbidden by an invisible force and could not be uttered!Previously, she had also tried, informing Ling Aotian of some information about the contents of the diary.But none of them could be spoken.This also convinced her once again: this was really the world of fiction.\u201cGo to hell!\u201dBlack Water Fury punched Jiang Mu hard in the abdomen in retaliation for him, calling her a damned bitch.Though the mouth said go to hell.But in the end, she still withdrew her strength to prevent accidentally killing him with a single punch.After all, she still had to rely on Jiang Mu\u2019s diary to spy on the plot\u2019s direction so that she could learn her own fate and ultimately ensure that her purpose was fulfilled.BANG!!!The fist smashed into Jiang Mu\u2019s stomach.\u201cGuhh!\u201dJiang Mu was punched so hard that he spat out a mouthful of water and his whole body flew backwards.\u201cCough!\u201dBlack Water Fury suddenly coughed violently.A sharp pain came from her abdomen, at the same time as she punched Jiang Mu away.It was like someone had punched her in the stomach with the same fist!\u201cYou\u2026 How did you strike back at this god?\u201dThe Black Water Fury covered her abdomen, her face looking slightly pained.Although she was only in her soul state, her power was only at the first level of the Qi Sea realm.But at least she was still at the Demon God realm, and her combat experience was far better than Jiang Mu\u2019s at the Spirit Gathering realm.And now.She couldn\u2019t see how Jiang Mu was able to counterattack her!It was simply \u2026. beyond her common sense!\u201cDon\u2019t you come over here!\u201dJiang Mu covered his stomach, forcing himself to get up with severe pain, looking at her like an enemy.Damn, this damned bitch, she was still so vicious in her attacks.Luckily, I had a \u2018pretend to be beaten body\u2019, which canceled out 50% of the damage.Otherwise, I guess she would have knocked me out with a single punch, and the consequences would have been unthinkable.\u201cAnswer this god! How exactly did you counterattack!\u201dThe Black Water Fury asked with a grim face, snapping again.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201dJiang Mu pretended to be confused.Of course he knew how he had countered.Since his body, strengthened by the \u2018Forced Steel Body\u2019, was one that would rebound 100% damage to the opponent when he was attacked.So.While she was punching him, she must have taken a 100% damage bounce herself.\u201cSince you refuse to talk, this god will beat you up until you talk!\u201dThe Black Water Fury made a dash and flashed in front of Jiang Mu.Once again, she raised her small fist and gave Jiang Mu a fierce punch in the abdomen.This time.She released her divine sense to perform an all-round capture of Jiang Mu\u2019s counterattack route.BANG!!!The fist smashed into Jiang Mu\u2019s abdomen.\u201cPoof!\u201dJiang Mu was once again punched away, and after spitting out a mouthful of blood in mid-air, he landed heavily on the ground.\u201cCough!!!\u201dThe Black Water Fury suddenly coughed violently, her face paled a few shades, and her entire body even took two steps backwards, nearly falling.A sharp pain came from her abdomen, at the same time as she punched Jiang Mu flying. Once again!It was like someone had punched her in the abdomen with the same fist!\u201cYou\u2026 What the hell are you\u2026 How did you counter this god?!\u201dShe covered her stomach and her face turned extremely pale.She herself had clearly used her divine sense.Yet she couldn\u2019t catch Jiang Mu\u2019s counterattack route at all!How was that possible?!She couldn\u2019t understand it at all.Jiang Mu wiped away the blood around his mouth and desperately tried to stand up.Damn it, I have to find a way to escape, or else I might really be killed by her.Suddenly.A \u201cMaster save me!\u201d came from far away.That was \u2026. Ling Aotian\u2019s miserable scream?Jiang Mu and Black Water Fury turned their heads at the same time and looked in the direction of the source of the sound.That direction was exactly where Ling Aotian and Sha Wuwen were.Immediately afterwards, there was another \u201cMaster save me!\u201d A miserable scream.Ling Aotian was in danger!This was the conclusion Jiang Mu and Black Water Fury came to at the same time.Black Water Fury frowned.Even though she had the cultivation realm of the Demon God realm.However, having previously cast the Black Serpent Divine Thunder, she had consumed too much.As a result, the power she could exert now was only at the first level of the Qi Sea realm, or at best, at the second level!Simply no match for Sha Wuwen of the Transformation Realm!It was not hard for her to use the Spatial Spiritual Technique and take Ling Aotian to escape?But that would go against the plot.What should I do now.And while Blackwater was worrying and contemplating.Jiang Mu took the opportunity to use Void Divine Concealment and blended into space.Then he quickly drew his legs and ran, desperately.Damn, no matter what, his own little life was at stake, he had to get away from this ferocious dead bitch first.However.He hadn\u2019t escaped a few meters when ripples of space suddenly appeared in front of him.In the blink of an eye, a black-skirted, black-haired, golden-eyed little loli appeared out of nowhere to block his way.The Black Water Fury\u2019s petite arm strangled Jiang Mu\u2019s throat once again.\u201cLet go of me! Cough cough cough \u2026.\u201dGam ah, why does she like to choke people so much!Jiang Mu was on the verge of suffocating from the choking, his spiritual will gradually fading, and the spiritual energy in his body becoming disordered.And the Void Divine Concealment, as a result, was lifted. Once again.!Eventually.His entire body was, once again, exposed to the Black Water Fury.The Black Water Fury threw Jiang Mu to the ground with her backhand.Then, straddling his body, she used a spatial spirit technique to temporarily imprison his movements.\u201cTo think of escaping from under the eyes of this god? Who gave you the courage.\u201d\u201cLet go of me now!\u201dJiang Mu was unable to move an inch as his body was sealed.\u201cLet you go? How could you say such foolish words.\u201dThe Black Water Fury snorted coldly, her golden vertical pupils staring at him fiercely.\u201cThough I don\u2019t know how you countered this god.\u201d\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d\u201cAs long as you become this God\u2019s slave, you can serve only this God for the rest of your life!\u201dShe stretched out her delicate arm and clenched her five fingers into a fist.A dense soul power coalesced on the fist.\u201cBlack Water Soul Etching Technique!\u201dHissing~The fist unexpectedly turned into the shape of a snake\u2019s head, but there were no eyes. Only a snake\u2019s mouth like an abyss.\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201dOpen your mouth?\u201cMMmuuh\u201dJiang Mu tightened his mouth in horror.The Black Water Fury sneered.\u201cYou\u2019re the first one who can make this god drain decades of her life to perform a forbidden technique!\u201dShe leaned down and cupped Jiang Mu\u2019s cheek with her other hand, forcibly prying his mouth open.\u201cBecome a loyal slave to this god!\u201dShe shoved her snake-like fist, violently, into Jiang Mu\u2019s mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cao ni ma!You\u2019re a sick loli!Jiang Mu couldn\u2019t speak. He could only curse her madly in his heart.But cursing was cursing.Instead, he didn\u2019t panic now.Because the Black Water Fury had said that this Soul Eroding Poison was poison!Because the Black Water Fury has said that this Soul Eater\u2019s poison is poison!Since it was poison.Then wouldn\u2019t one\u2019s \u2018All Poison Bearing Body\u2019 be able to do its job?Jiang Mu hurriedly looked inside his dantian.Sure enough!The Soul Eating Poison began to gradually converge on his dantian from all corners of his body!And the Poison Explosion Pill in his dantian was also starting to work.It was continuously absorbing and refining the Soul Eating Poison!The volume was also increasing extremely fast, nearly doubling in size in just a short time!The poisonous Qi lingering on the surface has also become even stronger!It was working!Jiang Mu\u2019s excitement was overflowing on the surface.This was the poison of a Demon God realm demon cultivator!Where could one find such a good opportunity to grow a Poison Explosion Pill?So he took the initiative to suck it all up, wanting more.\u201cIt seems that you can\u2019t wait to become a slave of this god.\u201dFeeling Jiang Mu\u2019s active sucking, the Black Water Fury was satisfied.Whether this was a fictional world or not, she didn\u2019t care.What she cared about was whether she could reclaim her flesh from her deadly enemy, and if she could exterminate the hundred clans above and below her deadly enemy!And Jiang Mu knew where the story was going, knew the end of her fate.Then, by turning Jiang Mu into her own slave, she would be in control of her own destiny!And her own purpose would be successfully achieved without wind or rain!The Black Water Fury stretched out her long, forked tongue and licked her lips round, in a very good mood.When Jiang Mu becomes my slave.Let\u2019s just order him to find a way to save Ling Aotian first, and let the storyline go on smoothly.The more the Black Water Fury thought about it in his heart, the happier she was, smiling as she looked at Jiang Mu, dying to pick him up and give him a deep kiss.Not to mention, this guy was quite handsome.The way he sucked, it was quite cute \u2026.. What?What\u2019s going on!My soul-etching poison \u2026.. It\u2019s not under control anymore?!The Black Water Fury\u2019s face suddenly changed.She found that.The Soul-Eating Poison that she had channeled to Jiang Mu had suddenly become more uncontrollable!She hurriedly stabilized her thoughts and controlled the amount of Soul Eroding Poison.However\u201cHow could it fail to be controlled!\u201d\u201cWhat have you done!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 Open your mouth!!!\u201dShe was horrified to find that as the Soul Eroding Poison was passing rapidly.The soul power in her body, as well as the Black Water Poison, was also decreasing at a rapid rate!If her soul power was gone, her soul would become extremely weak and she would fall into a long sleep.The Black Water Poison, on the other hand, was the strange poison of her Black Water Snake Clan, and one drop used was one drop less, and was incredibly valuable.\u201cSon of a bitch you loosen your mouth!!!\u201dThe Black Water Fury was terrified and tried to pull out her arm.But Jiang Mu bit it down so tightly that she couldn\u2019t pull it out.Loosen your mouth?Only a fool would let go of a treasure!I will suck you to death!Jiang Mu was laughing in his heart.As a result of absorbing the Soul Eroding Poison.The Poison Explosion Pill had grown twenty times bigger than before! Its power had also been increased by twenty times!He made an estimate.After the Poison Explosion Pill exploded, the poison produced would probably be able to kill a cultivator from the Returning Origin realm.In other words.He could, right now, completely expel the Poison Explosion Pill directly and scare away the Black Water Fury.\u201cYou! You let go of your mouth\u2026\u201dThe Black Water Fury felt an unprecedented crisis.Her body, due to the massive flow of Soul Eroding Poison, had begun to become illusory!She immediately used her other hand to choke Jiang Mu\u2019s throat, trying to force him to let go of his mouth.However, due to her weakness, she could barely exert her strength, causing her entire body to gradually fall softly onto Jiang Mu\u2019s body.The spatial spirit spell that had imprisoned Jiang Mu was thus lifted.I can move now?Jiang Mu was overjoyed in his heart.Immediately, he clasped his hands around the Black Water Fury and stood up.Followed by. \u201cFuck you, bitch _I_\u201dHe threw the Black Water Fury, hard, down into the sinkhole below.The hundred-meter deep sinkhole was so deep that the Black Water Fury just fell straight down.Finally, with her head facing the ground, she \u201cflopped!\u201d It plunged heavily into the mud pit.With great difficulty, she pulled her head out, and her small face and long black hair were instantly covered with mud, making her look very wretched.Jiang Mu didn\u2019t dare to stop and drew his legs and ran wildly towards Ling Aotian\u2019s position.The Black Water Fury within the sinkhole had a pair of golden vertical pupils, jawing, staring with dead eyes in the direction Jiang Mu had disappeared.\u201cThis god will never let you go!!! Son of a\u2013!!!\u201dA vicious roar resonated through the sky.It scared the fleeing Jiang Mu, who almost tripped.\u201cDamn, this plot has gone so crooked because of this loli grandma.\u201d\u201cForget about it, I will worry about that in later.\u201d\u201cThe first priority is to go save Ling Aotian, the protagonist.\u201d***On the other side.Xue Menghan, arrived in front of Jiang Mu\u2019s private airship.She ordered to the few guards escorting her.\u201cThere won\u2019t be any demonic beasts out here, you guys go back first, in Patriarch Jiang\u2019s lightning ship, this lady will be safe.\u201d\u201cYes! Miss!\u201dSeveral of the City Lord\u2019s guards answered in unison and turned their heads to leave in a neat manner.Looking at Jiang Mu\u2019s private Thunderlight ship, Xue Menghan revealed a wry smile.\u201cJiang, this is where I\u2019ll be staying for the next few days, let\u2019s see how you still follow the plot!\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you this lady\u2019s exclusive licking dog.\u201d\u201cHmph, I\u2019ll have you do you your job properly for the next few days, My Dog!\u201d\u201cHee hee hee \u2026.\u201dXue Menghan manipulated her spirit energy and cast her body technique, easily jumping onto the deck of the airship.Then she walked towards Jiang Mu\u2019s luxurious room.When it came to the door of the room.\u201cHuaaal-!\u201dA high-pitched, long, shrill woman\u2019s cry came out from the next room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

D-did perhaps something happen.!\u201dXue Menghan was perplexed.But she was here to find Jiang Mu, so she didn\u2019t care.So she returned to the door of Jiang Mu\u2019s room.\u201cHmph, when he sees this lady later, his expression will be sight to see hee hee hee.\u201dThinking of Jiang Mu\u2019s shocked expression later, Xue Menghan revealed a smug smile.She raised her hand and knocked on the door of the room.Knock! Knock!No one answered inside.\u201cIs he still sleeping? Pig.\u201dXue Menghan finally pushed open the door and found it unlocked.\u201cWhere\u2019s the man?\u201dAfter going inside, she searched around but couldn\u2019t see Jiang Mu\u2019s figure.That was when.In Ding Nanrong\u2019s room next door, there was a \u201cclattering!\u201d The sound of falling water.\u201cDoes it mean that \u2026.\u201d\u201cThat bastard Jiang is with Ding Nanrong and that\u00a0strange sound\u2013 \u2026.?\u201dXue Menghan\u2019s heart suddenly thought of a certain possibility.Ding Nanrong was Jiang Mu\u2019s personal maid.Apart from protecting Jiang Mu, she would also be responsible for Jiang Mu\u2019s basic daily life.Moreover, rumor had it that even for bathing, Ding Nanrong always helped Jiang Mu.All in all. The two of them were almost inseparable.Plus, Jiang Mu himself had said in his diary before that he would be leaving his godly waist to Ding Nanrong.In that case, they must be in the bathroom \u2026.\u201cBastard!\u201dXue Menghan clenched her fist and gritted her teeth.Looking at Ding Nanr Rong\u2019s room next door, for some reason, her heart felt very uncomfortable.After thinking about it, seriously.She seemed to have figured out as to why.\u201cHumph! This Jiang.\u201d\u201cAs this lady\u2019s fianc\u00e9, but before the marriage contract was even broken, he dared to have daylight adultery with his own maid?\u201d\u201cAnd you say that you only love me?\u201d\u201cNot keeping the words of a fianc\u00e9!\u201d\u201cGo to hell!\u201dShe kicked over the table in anger.And then murderously.She came in front of Ding Nanrong\u2019s room.She decided to carry out her duties as a fianc\u00e9e and stop her fianc\u00e9\u2019s affair!Bang!The door to the room was kicked open.Xue Menghan cursed loudly as she walked towards the bathroom.\u201cJiang you lustful dog! Come out now! Ugh!\u201dShe had only just stepped into the room when her feet slipped.She fell on the spot and landed on all fours.It hurts so much.Why is this damn floor so slippery?Pissed off and complaining, Xue Menghan got up.It was then.She felt a chill in her neck.A cold woman\u2019s voice also came from behind her.\u201cMiss Xue, what do you want to see me about.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dXue Menghan\u2019s body jolted.She found that there was a Water Lotus Sword, resting on her neck.She nervously turned her head to look.Seeing that it was Ding Nanrong.Ding Nanrong\u2019s hair was coiled. Her face was flushed. Her body was sticky and clammy, wrapped in a purple bathrobe.Being overly voluptuous caused the robe to be wrapped very barely, as if the robe could fall apart with one jump from her.\u201cHmph!\u201dIt was so big, I wonder if it was that guy\u2019s work!In broad daylight too, bah!The arrogance of Xue Menghan\u2019s city lord\u2019s thousand-year-old daughter shot up at once.She turned around and proudly locked eyes with Ding Nanrong.\u201cThis lady remembers you, your name is Ding Nanrong, you\u2019re Jiang Mu\u2019s personal maid, right?\u201d\u201cThat is me.\u201dDing Nanrong indifferently said back.Xue Menghan held her head high and said it in a commanding tone.\u201cSince you are Jiang Mu\u2019s personal attendant, and Jiang Mu is this lady\u2019s fianc\u00e9, then you are this lady\u2019s personal attendant as well!\u201d\u201cWhat are you trying to say.\u201d\u201cHmph, this lady commands you, withdraw your sword!\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dDing Nanrong gave a faint reply.The Water Lotus Sword in her hand, however, did not move away in the slightest.\u201cYou!\u201dThis infuriated Xue Menghan.This personal maid, how dare she disobey her orders!So in anger, she yelled towards the bathroom.\u201cJiang! Come out here! Come out and see how insolent your maid is!\u201dHowever, no one responded in the bathroom.\u201cBastard! Come out! What kind of man hides himself!\u201d\u201cWhat makes you think that the Patriarch is here with me.\u201dDing Nanrong intervened to stop her shouting.\u201cHmph! That bastard isn\u2019t in his room, and if he wasn\u2019t here with you, where could he be? You\u2019re not going to say he\u2019s out fighting demon beasts alone.\u201dXue Menghan was certain that Jiang Mu was right here.After all, the Demon Beast Mountain Range was full of dangers.And Jiang Mu couldn\u2019t even beat a random city lord\u2019s guards, let alone those ferocious demon beasts.\u201cThe Patriarch is not in my room, Miss Xue please go back.\u201dDing Nanrong withdrew her sword.So she was looking for the Patriarch.Then, the Patriarch wasn\u2019t in his room?Did he go out?How dare he walk around the Demon Beast Mountain Range without my protection?Not afraid of death.When he returns, I\u2019ll have to interrogate him about what he\u2019s been up to!Ding Nanrong was very displeased with Jiang Mu\u2019s act of going out alone.If Jiang Mu was really eaten by a demonic beast, then she wouldn\u2019t be able to witness him screwing up the Wuyou Sect, and she wouldn\u2019t be able to kill him with her own hands in the end.Then everything she had done by becoming his personal attendant would become meaningless.\u201cHow could he not be in your room!\u201dXue Menghan had one hand on her waist and pointed at Ding Nanrong\u2019s magnificent curves with the other as she angrily said.\u201cI heard it all just now! You were screaming so loudly and the water was clattering!\u201d\u201cHm?!\u201dDing Nanrong\u2019s gaze was cold, and the spiritual energy aura within her body suddenly surged out, causing the bathrobe on her body to float and threaten to fall apart.\u201cWhat am I doing with him in the bathroom.\u201dThe tone of voice was calm.However, the killing intent was very intense.It frightened Xue Menghan and sent a shiver down her spine.\u201cAh \u2026. Didn\u2019t \u2026. Didn\u2019t do anything \u2026.\u201dOnly then did her heart tremble as she remembered.The Ding Nanrong in front of her was a Returning Yuan realm cultivator!She was a strong cultivator of the same realm as her father, Xue Yuanshan!If she angered Ding Nanrong, she might just be\u2026 killed.Now.Xue Menghan no longer dared to stay.She forced her composure and said.\u201cSince Jiang Mu is not here, then I \u2026. I\u2019ll go out first, hey? You \u2026. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dAs she spoke, she noticed that Ding Nanrong was turning strange.\u201cYou \u2026. are you all right?\u201dShe saw that Ding Nanrong\u2019s face flushed a few shades and her eyes became misty.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDing Nanrong didn\u2019t reply, and in her heart she secretly thought that it was not good!Due to the spiritual energy she had activated just now, it had caused the water element poison in her body to accelerate.And.This caused the sensation to become even more intense.\u201cMmm~\u201dA muffled cry, which couldn\u2019t help but come out of her throat.Transparent mucus began to seep out from the skin of her entire body.The Water Lotus Sword in her hand fell with a clang. Her arms clutched her belly and her teeth clenched.A strange sensation elsewhere caused her legs to lose their strength.The whole person fell forward towards Xue Menghan.\u201cAh! D-don\u2019t you dare come over here \u2026..\u201dXue Menghan was frightened by this sudden appearance of hers.So she hurriedly backed up, trying to avoid her.However, due to the sticky and slippery, floor, carelessness caused her to slip backwards and fall.\u201c\u201d\u2013\u201c\u201dThe two of them fell on the floor together.\u201cAh! You get up!\u201dXue Menghan was pressed against Ding Nanrong and was so shocked that she hurriedly pushed her away as hard as she could.Just one push. Coupled with the fact that Ding Nanrong\u2019s body was sticky and slippery.The result was that the bathrobe was directly pushed undone.\u201cYou you! What the hell is wrong with you!\u201dXue Menghan was so pressed that she was completely flustered.Was she\u2026 exaggerating a little too much?!\u201cAh! You \u2026. You let go of me! How can you do this!\u201dXue Menghan struggled desperately.However, as Ding Nanrong\u2019s body was very slippery and she herself was not as strong as her, she could not break free at all.\u201cIf you don\u2019t let go of me, I\u2019ll ask Jiang Mu to kick you out\u2026 Mmmmmmmmm~?!\u201dXue Menghan\u2019s eyes instantly widened and her legs stretched straight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was always +1 every time before.So Jiang Mu didn\u2019t care, but is now at +2. So, he got a bit curious.If the value reached a max level. What would happen then?Would he become the world\u2019s most beautiful man?Would he attract female masters like Xue Menghan and Lu Churou?And at a later stage, a dozen more Heoines will appear one after another.The Holy Maiden of the Holy Land.The Long Fish Empress of the Long Fish Empire.The Dragon Princess of the Canglan Sea.The White Fox Clan Lord of the Nine Mysterious Quenching Cold Valley.The Abyssal Lord of the Blood Abyss.The Fairy of the Qingyue of the Yueqiao.A maiden of the Heavenly Clan of the Sea of the Primordial.So many female protagonists.In any case, what if they\u2019re all charmed by his handsomeness.It would be a disaster!The plot is definitely skewed to outer space!!!\u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about it, let\u2019s sleep.\u201dJiang Mu didn\u2019t dare and soon found a safe little cave, laid down inside and fell asleep.Since he was injured by the Black Water Fury.So, he had to get a good sleep and recover.***Early the next morning. Inside Jiang Mu\u2019s private airship.\u201cCluck-!\u201d\u201cWoo-!\u201d\u201cWooooooo \u2026.\u201dXue Menghan had been crying all day and night, her tears gone dry.She regretted coming to find Jiang Mu. She didn\u2019t expect this personal attendant of Jiang Mu\u2019s to be so rampant.\u201cSister Rong, please let go of me, I want to go back, woo woo.\u201dXue Menghan sobbed and complained, and while crying, she struggled hard.But Ding Nanrong\u2019s cultivation level was stronger than hers, so much so that she had been unable to even move an inch.\u201cYou can return tomorrow.\u201dDing Nanrong closed her eyes and didn\u2019t move a muscle. She also quietly waited for the next wave of water element poison to strike.\u201cYo-You\u2019re talking nonsense!\u201dXue Menghan blushed even redder in anger. How could she slander someone!\u201cBut then again, You are Jiang Mu\u2019s maid, why don\u2019t you look for him.\u201dSince she couldn\u2019t escape, Xue Menghan had to resign herself to her fate and began to chit-chat with Ding Nanrong.Ding Nanrong didn\u2019t avoid it and explained.\u201cYou should have heard of the Five Great Physiques, right? I belong to the Innate Yuan Body and have awakened the power of Water Yuan.\u201d\u201cInnate Yuan Body, The power of water element?\u201dXue Menghan of course, knows that.As a daughter of a city lord, she was naturally taught and aware of the five major physiques in the Cangling Spirit Realm.They were: the Innate Yuan Body, the Innate Spirit Body, the Demon Ancestor Bloodline, the Moon God\u2019s Body, and the Martial Gods Reincarnation.These five physiques each had their own characteristics.No matter which one they awakened, they would be stronger than people of the same realm and their future achievements would be remarkable. That\u2019s how it\u2019s always been.And Ding Nanrong was an innate Yuan Body, having awakened the power of Water Yuan.But at the same time. Water Yuan Poison also developed in her body!Whenever the water elemental poison flared up, if it wasn\u2019t relieved away in time, she would turn into a demon.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better if your water element poison flared up? Why don\u2019t you double cultivate with Jiang Mu?\u201dXue Menghan was very puzzled. She didn\u2019t expect that Ding Nanrong didn\u2019t do that with Jiang Mu. Is she still a virgin?Although Jiang\u2019s cultivation level was not good.But he was handsome and with a background, and there were many young and beautiful women eager to marry him.What? Wait! Could it be that what Jiang Mu said was true? He only loves me?Xue Menghan suddenly recalled what Jiang Mu had said to her at the birthday banquet.[I have loved you and only you since I was a child][The farthest distance in life is not life and death, but me standing in front of you, but you don\u2019t know that I love you.]As she thought about it, Xue Menghan\u2019s face turned even redder, and her little heart pounded.What is this feeling! It\u2019s amazing~Not knowing her feelings, Ding Nanrong explained.\u201cIt is not possible to double cultivate with him.\u201d\u201cIf I give him my yin yuan, I will be dependent on him for the rest of my life.\u201d\u201cAfter that, if I don\u2019t have him, when the water element poison in my body kicks in.\u201d\u201cIt would be even more violent and the consequences would be even more severe, and it would no longer be manageable.\u201d\u201cUnless I break through to the Martial God realm, it\u2019s only a matter of time before I become a demon.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u201d Xue Menghan understood. She suddenly thought of her diary and the contents once she read about Ding Nanrong and remembered.[The only thing that supports her to live now is to stay by my side, to see the complete decay and destruction of my Wuyou Sect with her own eyes, and then finally to kill me with her own hands].[That\u2019s why she\u2019s willing to become my personal maid, protecting the wasteful me while watching how I mess up the Wuyou Sect.]So that\u2019s how it is. In other words, this Ding Nanrong is not actually Jiang Mu\u2019s maid in the real sense?In the end, she was going to kill Jiang Mu with her own hands? Xue Menghan finally understood why Ding Nanrong preferred to relieve herself rather than looking for Jiang Mu.Because she was going to kill Jiang Mu in the end and after Jiang Mu\u2019s death, she would also eventually become demonized sooner or later if her water element poison attacked.So that\u2019s why Ding Nanrong was not going to have sex with Jiang Mu.I don\u2019t know why, but when she found out that Jiang Mu and Ding Nanrong didn\u2019t have such a relationship.In her heart, she wasa bit happy.But then again, could Ding Nanrong really kill Jiang Mu? Her intuition told Xue Menghan that she definitely couldn\u2019t.\u201cHere it comes.\u201dDing Nanrong\u2019s next wave kicked in.(Notes: Did you expect XXX? Too bad, Ding Nanroung fell on Menghan and didn\u2019t move bc sightset movement caused her to feel so much tingly feelings all over her body and used her something like a hug pillow.)***\u201cYawn~\u201d Inside the cave, Jiang Mu slept until around noon before waking up.It was probably because he had been injured by the Black Water Fury, which was what caused him to sleep longer than usual.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that there\u2019s nothing to do with that Bitch in the latter days of the hunting season.\u201d\u201cOtherwise, it would be impossible for me to continue this hunting season.\u201d\u201cFuu~, Let\u2019s write today\u2019s diary first, it\u2019s not a good idea to skip work.\u201d\u201cI hope the rewards wouldn\u2019t be bad this time too.\u201dSo he summoned his diary, and started writing today\u2019s quota.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seems that the author of this book, The Harem of the Martial Gods, is a dumb ass.][Anyway, there\u2019s no end to nonsense. Otherwise, how could this book, which could have been finished in 2.5 million words, have been written in 10 million words. The unspoken tacit agreement of the online writing community.]I finished and closed the diary.\u201cWhy does it feel like I\u2019m writing a nonsense, too?\u201d\u201cBut it can\u2019t be helped, in the original plot, this hunting season in the latter days, there really isn\u2019t much of a strong conflict plot.\u201d\u201cBasically, it\u2019s all about Ling Aotian, the male protagonist, beating his face, killing demonic beasts, hunting demonic cores for the Black Water Fury to absorb for strength recovery and so on.\u201d[Ding, congratulations to the host, successful diary writing.][Temperament +2][Face Value +2]????\u201cHow come there\u2019s no reward!\u201dJiang Mu was stunned.There was always a good reward for writing in the diary, but today it was suddenly gone.It left a very uncomfortable, empty feeling in the heart, after all, these were rewards were so awesome, made my life easy!\u201cCould it be that I didn\u2019t write enough?\u201dSo Jiang Mu tried to think about it, to see what other plots he could write today in an attempt to get a good reward.\u201cBy the way, that Han Yuqing, she should have arrived at the Wuyou Sect today, right?\u201d\u201cHmm, let\u2019s just write about her.\u201dThen he summoned his diary again. Write it down.[Today is the day that Han Yuqing arrived at the Wuyou Sect.][Although she is not the main female character, she is an important female villain.][And, she\u2019s also my wife.][Damn, she is a hardcore pervert. She likes to hurt herself, and she likes to have me abuse her.][When the hunting season is over, and I return to the Wuyou Sect, I\u2019m going to follow my parents\u2019 wishes and marry this pervert Han Yuqing.][My life is so miserable. I have to lick that stupid dog Xue Menghan, during the day and deal with this pervert Han Yuqing at night.][Life is not easy. I hope the system boss will give some good rewards to comfort me.]***At the same time time. Ten miles away from Jiang Mu\u2019s location to the south.There stood, a woman on a huge tree. She was young and beautiful, and her long, slender, lake blue dress rose slightly with the wind.If Jiang Mu had seen the butterfly scar on the woman\u2019s cheek, he would have doubted his life.Because this woman. It was none other than Han Yuqing!She wasn\u2019t in the Wuyou Sect, but had come straight towards this side of the Demonic Beast Mountain Range after departing the Xuanyang Sect!\u201cSo I\u2019m a female villain, huh?\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201d Looking at Jiang Mu\u2019s Private Diary in her hand, Han Yuqing revealed a strange smile.\u201cMy good husband, when you return to the Wuyou Clan, and we get married, I\u2019ll give you a different reward every day.\u201dShe murmured with a beautiful smile. Her eyes looked towards the space below her.There were seven distinctive-looking cultivators surrounding a black-robed youth.The black-robed youth was none other than Ling Aotian.\u201cThe diary said that there were petty bandits snatching Ling Aotian\u2019s demon beast trophies.\u201d\u201cBut now, they\u2019re not petty bandits kukuku.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re the group of \u2018Bu Yang Seven\u2019 that I purposely found to test Ling Aotian\u2019s strength.\u201dHan Yuqing watched with great interest. Let\u2019s see if Ling Aotian, the male protagonist, will be defeated by the \u2018Bu Yang Seven\u2019 or if he will succeed in punching his face as stated in the diary.\u201cI, Ling Aotian, have nothing to do with you \u2018Bu Yang\u2019, do you want to beat me up just because I look better than you?!\u201dLing Aotian was furious. He was in the middle of a battle with Black Boar.When suddenly , seven extremely uncoordinated-looking people leapt out of the side and surrounded him.Then these seven people said that he was handsome and were jealous and wanted to beat him up.It was unbelievable! A short, thin man with a right-angled triangular face jumped out and pointed at Ling Aotian with a sharp voice and said.\u201cIf you were Patriarch Jiang, we\u2019d have gone around, but you\u2019re not, you\u2019re the one to beat him up, let\u2019s go guys! Strip him naked and throw him into the swamp!\u201dClank! Clank! Clank!Seven tall, short, fat and thin, unattractive cultivators pounced on Ling Aotian in anger and jealousy.\u201cBullies!!!\u201dLing Aotian roared in anger as his whole body\u2019s spiritual energy exploded and his top suit instantly burst open, revealing his sturdy muscles and making himself look fierce.But it didn\u2019t seem to help much. It was because among the seven people on the opposite side, there were five at the Spirit Gathering Realm and two at the second level of the Qi Sea Realm.So. huff! huff! huff!Three minutes later. Ling Aotian, who was bruised, ragged and disheveled, burst out of the swamp in a wretched state.\u201cThe Bu Yang Seven! I, Ling Ao Tian, will never let you go! Bullying people too much-!!!\u201dThe cry of humiliation resounded throughout the forest. It also reached Han Yuqing\u2019s ears atop the giant tree.\u201cHeh, Ling Aotian has failed to punch in the face, it seems that the contents of the diary, can be changed.\u201d\u201cBut then again, this Ling Aotian, he was actually able to rely on his cultivation level of the Gathering Spirit realm to resist five Gathering Spirit realms and two Qi Sea realms without dying, not bad for a male protagonist.\u201d\u201cIt seems that the potential is good.\u201dFinishing her thoughts, Han Yuqing jumped down from the giant tree. She landed gracefully in front of Ling Aotian.\u201cWho are you!\u201d Ling Aotian was on full alert mode.The strange seven people who had dragged him into the swamp so hard just now had already beaten him up.Now that a stranger suddenly appeared again, it made him panic.After all, his own master was recovering in Void Space and couldn\u2019t help him these days.\u201cMy name is Han Yuqing, a disciple of the Xuanyang Sect.\u201dHan Yuqing didn\u2019t hide her identity in the slightest and continued to introduce herself.\u201cBut in a few days, I will become the Patriarch\u2019s wife of the Wuyou Sect, so you can address me as Madam Jiang.\u201d\u201cMadam Jiang? What do you want from me!\u201dLing Aotian was secretly wary in his heart.So, this young and beautiful woman was Jiang Mu\u2019s wife?Did she come looking for me \u2013To kill me?!Ling Aotian felt an incomparable crisis.Han Yuqing jumped down in front of his eyes without warning, and her spiritual energy fluctuations were almost unnoticeable.It meant that her cultivation strength was even higher than those seven people, from earlier and him!Perhaps it was the Returned Origin realm? Or at least the ninth level of the Qi Sea realm!Now he didn\u2019t have the assistance of his master. He would surely be killed by Han Yuqing.Either that or he would have to \u2013use that card!That ultimate card, it was so deadly that even his master didn\u2019t know about it; He kept it secret!Once that ultimate card was revealed, then his master, the Demon God realm\u2019s Black Water Fury, might even kill him!But now, there was no way out.Ling Aotian secretly gathered his aura and channeled a prismatic crystal block within his heart.However. Han Yuqing\u2019s following words caused him to halt his action of exposing his ultimate card.She broke into a strange smile and said.\u201cRelax, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m here to kill you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen the battle just now, you\u2019re pretty good.\u201d\u201cSo, I want to make a deal with you, let\u2019s work together secretly.\u201d**[I hope the system boss gives some good rewards to comfort me.]After finishing writing the diary.Jiang Mu closed the book.

Whoa, isn\u2019t that damn cheat?\u201dOriginally, there was a bonus after passing the level: the ability to bring any one character back to reality.And now there was \u2018Su Sheng of the Dead.That\u2019s like, getting to choose an extra character character!Hehehe, double the pleasure. No, it was N times the pleasure!Jiang Mu remembered, inside this Harem of the Martial Gods, there were several female protagonists that had ended up dead.For example, Lu Chorou, Qu Nishang, Black Water Fury, and Tianyue Qingdi.In other words, he could resurrect these female protagonists through \u2018Su Sheng of the Dead\u2019!And after these heroines are resurrected, he can bring them back to the real world after passing the level!As for whether the resurrection would affect the subsequent storyline? This was not something Jiang Mu was worried about.After all, the system\u2019s work would be of the highest quality, so it wouldn\u2019t screw itself over.Besides, what would one do after bringing these female protagonists back to the real world? let\u2019s leave it until then.Jiang Mu was in a very good mood, but once he saw the conditions for using this \u2018Su Sheng of the Dead\u2019.His mood instantly dropped and he felt disgusted by the system.\u201cAfter resurrecting a character using Dead Man\u2019s Su Sheng, that character will gain one of their own rewards, and they will lose that reward permanently.\u201dHe opened his personal rewards panel.[Name: Jiang Mu][Temperament] 12/100[Face Value] 12/100[Possession of reward \u2460: Body of pretending to take a beating][Possession of reward \u2461: A Man of Steel Body][Possession of reward \u2462: Godly Waist][Possessing reward \u2463: The Body That Bears All Poisons][Possession Reward \u2464: Void Divine Concealment (Spiritual Art)][Possession Reward \u2465: Su Sheng of the Dead (Rule)[Tips: Click on the reward to see the details]Currently.If revived any character, let\u2019s say.

What do you mean.\u201dLing Aotian didn\u2019t understand, this woman called Han Yuqing, who was going to be Jiang Mu\u2019s wife, wants to make a deal and secretly work with him?She must have an ulterior motive! \u201cJust as I said.\u201dHan Yuqing stroked the butterfly scar on her cheek, revealing a strange smile as she unapologetically spelled out her intentions:.\u201cIn the future, I want to overthrow the Xuanyang Sect and execute the sect master, Fang Yansong.\u201d\u201cBut Fang Yansong is at the Void Refining Realm, while I\u2019m only at the ninth level of the Qi Sea Realm, so I can\u2019t do it yet. Therefore, I need powerful ally.\u201d\u201cAnd you, Ling Aotian, you have good potential and will definitely be able to break through to the Void Refining Realm in the future and maybe beyond. Therefore, I want to make deal with you and become friends.\u201dOverthrowing the Xuanyang Clan? killing the Refining Void realm clan master, Fang Yansong?Ling Aotian\u2019s face twitched slightly as he was secretly shocked at what he just heard.One should know, that the Xuanyang Sect had overtaken the Wuyou Sect and become a new the dominant clan in the southern realm of Lizhou, and was one of the four major sects in Lizhou!Its power and status were so strong that it was ranked among the best in the entire Kyushu Continent. The patriarch of the Xuanyang Clan, Fang Yansong, was so overwhelmingly powerful cultivator of the Void Refining Realm, an existence that could do as he pleases across Kyushu!How could Han Yuqing, a Qi Hai realm practitioner, want to destroy such a huge monster? Where did that come from?Ling Aotian looked at Han Yuqing in front of him, dressed in a long lake blue dress, highlighting her slim and beautiful figure.Looking at her young appearance, she was about in her twentys. The scar on her cheek did not hide her beauty, but added a charm to her because of the shape of the butterfly.In one word, beautiful, it was a pity that she was going to marry that wasteful patriarch Jiang Mu\u2026Ling Aotian shook his head and sighed, his heart quite upset.\u201cMiss Han, if I remember correctly, you are a disciple of the Xuanyang Sect? Why did you want to overthrow the sect you belong to? And why did you want to kill Fang Yansong? And why did you marry \u2026. Jiang Mu, that punk?\u201dHan Yuqing suddenly pouted her lips, looking aggrieved and pitiful.\u201cYoung master Ling, I\u2019ve already said enough to show my sincerity in cooperating with you, but you still want to ask the bottom of the matter, do you like me? Are you trying to bully me? Cry~\u201dThe woman\u2019s arms were wrapped around her and she took two steps back.An \u2018I\u2019m weak and helpless, don\u2019t bully me\u2019 pretentious posture.\u201cThat..\u201d Ling Aotian\u2019s heart skipped a beat and his breath caught slightly sharply.This young and beautiful Han Yuqing was clearly a stronger cultivator than him.Now, she was pretending to be this weak and talking out of tune.It really made him feel very\u2026 Novelty and reverie? He touched his nose, pretended to be calm, and said with a spontaneous smile.\u201cSince Miss Han thinks so highly of me, Ling Aotian, then it\u2019s no good for me to pass it off, how can we collaborate?\u201dHan Yuqing let out a sly smile, took out an exquisite bag from the Soul Ring, and threw it to Ling Aotian.\u201cThe way of cooperation is very simple, I will provide you with cultivation resources on a regular basis, and you will help me overthrow the Xuanyang Sect in the future.\u201d\u201cThis bag will be considered as the first investment in you, after I become the Madam Patriarch of the Wuyou Sect, I will have the right to control the resources of the Wuyou Sect.\u201d\u201cIf Young Master Ling wants more resources, you have to work hard to cultivate oh, don\u2019t let people\u2019s investment go to waste.\u201dLing Aotian caught the bag, after opening it and looking at it, his eyes lit up.There were all sorts of spiritual medicines, and herbs inside, as well as dozens of demon cores!One of the demon cores was from the Transformation Realm!This bag of spiritual herbs and medicines was enough to allow him, Ling Aotian, to recover from his injuries, and that demon core could also allow his master, Black Water Fury, to greatly recover her strength!\u201d All right! I promise!\u201d Ling Aotian agreed to Han Yuqing\u2019s request for cooperation with barely any hesitation.He had great confidence in his potential, that he could definitely break through to the Void Refining Realm in the future!Moreover, in fact, he only needed to break through to the Returning Origin realm, and he would have the certainty to kill a Void Refining realm cultivator!He, Ling Aotian, had the underpinnings to be able to fight beyond his level!\u201cBut Miss Han, aren\u2019t you afraid that I\u2019ll take the stuff and run away? You trust me that easily?\u201dLing Aotian weighed the bag in his hand and raised his eyebrows.Han Yuqing put her hands behind her back and smiled brightly.\u201cIf you run away, it means I didn\u2019t give enough, it means I don\u2019t have the strength to cooperate, isn\u2019t that normal?\u201d\u201cMiss Han is really \u2026. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m a good person.\u201dLing Aotian agreed with her words. This was originally a world where the strong preyed on the weak.Without strength, you have no qualifications to negotiate.Suddenly. He had a thought in his mind.She had just said: if you run away, it means I didn\u2019t give enough!!!Does that mean she could give more?Ling Aotian\u2019s eyes lit up with greed as he scanned up Han Yuqing\u2019s figure and appearance.She was slim and pretty, beautiful and young, charming and neat. The more he looked at it, the more he liked it, and the more he saw it, the more his heart fluttered.\u201cMiss Han, I have a matter that I dare to ask!\u201dHan Yuqing cocked her head in disbelief, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dLing Aotian\u2019s gaze blazed, \u201cAfter I have overthrown the Xuanyang Sect, I hope that Miss Han will leave that trash Jiang Mu and become my Ling Aotian\u2019s woman!\u201dAs he said this, he deliberately took a small step forward, striking a handsome pose and revealing a confident yet evil smile.It was just that his bruised, ragged and cloaked, wretched appearance made him look comical.\u201cThen we\u2019ll have to see how Young Master Ling performs, work hard, hehehe.\u201dHan Yuqing pursed her lips and smiled, the butterfly scars on her cheeks making the smile become charming.This caused Ling Aotian\u2019s heart to tremble.He said with an overbearing aura, \u201cI will do it! I, Ling Aotian, am definitely not a rat!\u201d\u2026Jiang Mu arrived at the airship where Xue Menghan was. He used Void Divine Concealment to merge his body into the void.Preparing to board the airship, he directly entered Xue Meng Han\u2019s room to more conveniently observe her persona.While passing by a few guards, he happened to overhear their gossipy chatter.\u201cI heard that yesterday, Eldest Miss ran off to find Patriarch Jiang, is it true.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true, we personally escorted her there.\u201d\u201cOhh! She hasn\u2019t come back for a day and a night, did she sleep with Patriarch Jiang?\u201d\u201cSleeping my ass! Don\u2019t talk nonsense, she called us back after we finished escorting her anyway.\u201d\u201cBut she stayed alone? That\u2019s a big possibility that she slept, haha.\u201d\u201cSleep Nima! Missy is the most beautiful girl in Xue City, but Jiang Mu is a licker, how can he be worthy?\u201d\u201cNot necessarily, right, after all, Missy is only sixteen years old, ignorant and young, while Patriarch Jiang is high in rank, handsome and rich, she will probably throw herself at him, so I dare to conclude that they must have made love, tsk tsk.\u201d\u201cNasty-minded shit, go away! Don\u2019t come near me.\u201d\u201cWhy are you cursing people? Aren\u2019t we just gossiping? Every hunting season, Missy has always enthusiastically participated in killing demon beasts, but now she\u2019s running to Patriarch Jiang, don\u2019t you think there\u2019s something fishy? It makes sense that she slept with him, right?\u201d\u201cSleep with your mother!\u201d\u201cI said don\u2019t curse, we\u2019re civilised people.\u201d\u201cSleep with your mother!\u201d\u201cWhy are you still cursing?\u201d\u201cSleep with your mother, dammit!\u201d\u201cFuck, I\u2019ve been putting up with you for a long time! ***#%@$!\u201dCurses! Curses! Curses! Curses!The two of them fought in front of Jiang Mu, but, he didn\u2019t have the heart to enjoy the fight of two chicks fighting at all.He immediately turned around, in a hurry, and headed in the direction of his private airship.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So numb that he felt like his hair was about to fall.What he feared most was that Xue Menghan would barge into Ding Nanrong\u2019s room!With that old virgin with a ruthless temperament, once she was caught in the act of shame, wouldn\u2019t she just cut Xue Menghan to pieces?If Xue Menghan died, what was the point of me playing a Villain and getting beaten routinely to death?\u201cWhat? Wait a minute!\u201d Jiang Mu stopped in his tracks, his brow furrowed in thought.\u201cCould it be that the system rewarded \u2018Dead Man Su Sheng\u2019 to me by predicting that Xue Menghan would die? and I had to use \u2018Su Sheng of the Dead\u2019 to bring Xue Menghan back to life in order to be able to pass the level?\u201d\u201cAnd then Xue Menghan will get my reward, in other words, the system is taking back my reward in disguise? that would be pretty\u2026\u201d\u201cJust very doggy!\u201dThe more Jiang Mu thought about it, the more he felt that the dog system was deliberately screwing him over, but he didn\u2019t have any evidence to prove it himself.At that moment, a beautiful woman in a long lake blue dress approached from the front.The woman walked with her hands behind her back, humming a little tune and walking with a finch.When she saw Jiang Mu, her eyes lit up and she shouted joyfully.\u201cHusband!\u201dHusband? This voice? This accent, could it be?Jiang Mu looked up in horror and he immediately turned his feet and left, pretending not to see anyone.And in his heart, he was already cursing the heavens.\u201cNima, shouldn\u2019t Han Yuqing be in the Wuyou Sect!\u201d\u201cHow could this pervert appear in the Demon Beast Mountain Range. It\u2019s over, it\u2019s over!\u201d\u201cThe plot is crooked to bottomless pit!\u201d However, before he could go far, Han Yuqing swept ahead of him with a single step of her foot and her body in a flash.\u201cHusband!\u201d Han Yuqing surprised Jiang Mu by wrapping him into her arms, and even covered his face in her chest, rubbing it tightly.\u201cLet go of \u2026. Let go of me! Who\u2019s your husband! Get the hell out of my way!\u201dJiang Mu struggled to break free, pointing at her jade nose and scolding her angrily in the face.\u201cTell you what! If you hadn\u2019t compelled my parents to marry you to me before they died, I would have ordered Rong\u2019er to kill you ten thousand times over!\u201dAlthough I don\u2019t know why Han Yuqing appeared, but to maintain the villainous persona of the original book, Jiang Mu had to put on a show.In the original plot, although the two were in a husband and wife persona relationship, however, the two did not love each other at all.Or rather, it was Han Yuqing who tried desperately to please Jiang Mu to secure her status as the patriarch\u2019s wife. Jiang Mu, on the other hand, loathes Han Yuqing immensely.It was because she had compelled his parents to make a last wish for Jiang Mu to marry her before his parents died, but Jiang Mu loved Xue Menghan and did not like her at all.He also thought that she had bad intentions and was trying to conspire against the Wuyou Sect.Therefore, Jiang Mu hated her and wanted to kill her before anything happened.\u201cNow, at once, get the hell out of here! Get as far away as you can! I don\u2019t want to see you!\u201d Finished his scolding.Jiang Mu was furious, picked up his feet, and left.Damn it, Xue Menghan running off to find me was already unthinkable.Now Han Yuqing, who should originally be at Wuyou Sect but instead is here. Made his stomach churn.The system! System, say something!He called out to the system in his heart, but there was no response.Han Yuqing swept up to Jiang Mu again and opened her arms to block the way.She pouted her lips and said in a resigned voice. \u201cHusband, the Demon Beast Mountain Range is so dangerous, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll get hurt, so I\u2019ve rushed over here to protect you, but you\u2019re actually being mean to me and telling me to get lost, I\u2019m so sad, crying~\u201dAs she said that, a tear fell from the corner of her eye, and this pretentious gesture gave Jiang Mu goosebumps.But in his heart, he still admired her acting skills. It was still so realistic as always.\u201cThen go ahead and cry, and roll while you do so.\u201d Jiang Mu didn\u2019t bother to pay any more attention to her.Right now he just wanted to return to his private airship as soon as possible to see what kind of situation Xue Menghan was in.\u201cHusband, don\u2019t kick me out, okay, I-I\u2019ll be obedient, I\u2019ll even perform a meat cutting, look!\u201dHan Yuqing took out a knife from her ring, and lifted her sleeve to reveal a dense and creepy scar.\u201cHusband, watch!\u201dShe pressed the tip of the knife against the skin of her wrist.Then.Slice!The knife pulled quickly, bloody mark appeared appallingly on the arm, and blood trickled down at once, the rippling flesh inside shocking to the eye.\u201cSee, I didn\u2019t lie to you Husband, did I? Do you like it? Hehehe.\u201d Han Yuqing smiled brightly.It was just the beautiful butterfly scar on her face that twisted with her smile, causing it to look eerie.It gave Jiang Mu a sickening chill when he looked at it.\u201cYou you pervert!!!\u201d Cursing in shock, Jiang Mu turned and ran in fear.Damn, it looked like it was impossible to go back to the private airship for the time being.Otherwise, if Han Yuqing went back to the airship with himself, he would definitely be annoyed by her perverted self-mutilating tendencies.\u201cHusband, don\u2019t you want me anymore, I cry! Wooo!\u201d Han Yuqing cried out, following Jiang Mu\u2019s figure like maggots to a bone.Why can\u2019t you die from crying! Damn you! Jiang Mu cursed angrily in his heart, completely ignoring Han Yuqing\u2019s fake tears behind him.All he wanted to do now was to avoid her and get back to his private airship as soon as possible.Except that she was following him very closely, her eyes never leaving his back at all.This made him completely afraid to use Void Divine Concealment, and he had to hide his skills and somehow shake her off.Who knew, this shaking would go on for a whole day.The next day, it was just breaking dawn.Inside the cave, Jiang Mu woke up from his sleep.When he opened his eyes, he saw Han Yuqing, who was holding his arm next to him.He had avoided her all day yesterday, but in the end, he was too tired to hide, so he had no choice but to find a cave to stay in.Han Yuqing smiled and softly spoke lovingly. \u201cHusband, good morning.\u201dGood morning Nima!Jiang Mu didn\u2019t give her a good face just because she smiled nicely, and said coldly.\u201cYou\u2019ve been holding my arm for a day and a night, aren\u2019t you tired, are you a sloth.\u201dHe said and pulled his arm, but failed to withdraw it because he was weak.\u201cStaying by my husband\u2019s side, I\u2019m not tired at all, hehehe.\u201d Han Yuqing smiled so happily that her eyes were turning into a curved moon.She softly said, \u201cWhat would Husband like to eat for breakfast, I\u2019ll make it for you, would you?\u201dUgh. What a sin.Jiang Mu was helpless.He knew that everything Han Yuqing did was to please him, to be able to grasp greater power in the Wuyou Sect, and her ultimate goal, of course, was to use the Wuyou Sect to attack the Xuanyang Sect in the future.\u201cDo sh\u2013. Uh, I want to eat barbecue, Can you go do it?\u201dJiang Mu immediately took back his words of scolding her and said he wanted to eat barbecue instead.This was a good opportunity. He could take advantage of the fact that she wasn\u2019t paying attention.He would be able to use Void Divine Concealment himself to escape!\u201cOkay~.\u201d Han Yuqing smiled sweetly as she let go of Jiang Mu\u2019s hand and stood up to walk into an open space.And her standing position was also very deliberate. She was facing the entrance of the cave, so that she wasn\u2019t afraid of Jiang Mu\u2019s escape.She knew that Jiang Mu loathed her, but she didn\u2019t care at all.She believed that as long as she used various attacks on Jiang Mu and succeeded in getting him to take her virginity.Then, she would gain more and more power!If she were to get conceived, then, the entire Wuyou Sect would be hers!At that time, she would definitely be sure that she would be able to strengthen the Wuyou Sect.Eventually, she would use all the power of the Wuyou Sect to slaughter the Xuanyang Sect!And then with her own hands\u2026 And then kill that man\u2026 To death!Heh heh heh.A perverted and maniacal look flashed across Han Yuqing\u2019s eyes, and from her space ring, she took out the burning rack and other things.And for this very brief moment while she was busy with Jiang Mu on her back.Jiang Mu immediately used Void God Concealment in silence and he completely submerged his body into the void.Then, secretly, he moved towards the entrance of the cave. In the end, he safely managed to sneak out of the cave.\u201cHusband, do you want to eat the deer leg or the cow leg? The meat was killed the day before yesterday, it\u2019s very fresh Eh?.\u201dHan Yuqing grasped a huge bloody deer leg in one hand and a huge bloody cow leg in the other, and turned to ask Jiang Mu.Pop!The meat of the two legs fell to the ground.\u201cHusband?\u201d She was stunned to find that Jiang Mu was no longer there.She hurriedly searched inside the cave and there\u2019s no sign of him.\u201cDid he run away, heh, heh, heh, heh \u2026.\u201dHan Yuqing let out a crazed laugh, her body still trembling uncontrollably.She couldn\u2019t resist taking out the knife and pulling a slit into her abdomen.Looking at the trickle of blood and feeling the intense pain, her trembling body slowly calmed down.It took a moment before she picked up the meat from the floor.Humming a little tune as she put the meat on the grill.It was as if nothing had just happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Villain\u2019s Diary \u2013 The Heroine\u2019s Character CrumblesCH 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOne hour after, Jiang Mu managed to escape Han Yuqing\u2019s entanglement.In the end, there was no danger, and he returned to his private airship.\u201cToday, Ding Nanrong\u2019s water element poison should have finished its effects.\u201d\u201cXue Menghan, the heroine, mustn\u2019t be killed by Ding Nanrong.\u201dSilently, he prayed. Jiang Mu took his stance and jumped onto the deck of the airship.Only just landing on his feet, he was startled by a strange shouting sound.\u201cYuaaa-!\u201d\u201cKyyaaa!\u201dA high-pitched, long, shrill cry, and a short one.From Ding Nanrong\u2019s room, next door, it came out.\u201cWhat\u2019s that? and it cane from Ding Nanrong\u2019s room. Yelp!\u201d\u201cAnd Then the other one is Xue Menghan now!\u201d\u201cPhew~, fortunately, she\u2019s alive! Xue Menghan isn\u2019t dead. My rewards are safe!\u201dJiang Mu was relieved. He knew it all too well. Xue Menghan\u2019s voice, but why was she screaming?Was she scared by Ding Nanrong\u2019s power? Forget about it for now.He had to find out now why Xue Menghan was looking for him, or else, I will feel uneasy all the time.Jiang Mu quickly made his way to Ding Nanrong\u2019s room and just as he was about to raise his hand and knock on the door.The door was opened from the inside and a silhouette rushed out.Bang!The silhouette collided with Jiang Mu.\u201cOuch! That hurts!\u201d\u201cF*ck! Do you have no eyes dog \u2026. Menghan? What are you doing here? Ohhh, I\u2019ve missed you so much!\u201dJiang Mu, who had been bumped on the forehead, almost broke into a cursing fit.Luckily, he remembered in time that he was the character of a licking dog in front of Xue Menghan, so it was impossible to scold her to her face.\u201cAre you alright, Menghan! Let me help you up.\u201dJiang Mu\u2019s attitude was full of concern as he helped Xue Menghan up from the ground.Xue Menghan\u2019s dress was sorta messy, so much so that Jiang Mu saw the emerald green fabric inside her collar.On the fabric was the word Meng embroidered on it, only, the word \u2018Meng\u2019 was reversed.\u201cAaaah! It\u2019s Jiang Mu! I, I\u2019m going back! Bye!\u201dAs soon as Xue Menghan saw Jiang Mu, her face, which was already flushed, immediately turned redder than a tomato.Then the scented breeze dispersed and her whole body 'swoosh!\u201d In an instant, she scurried out of the private airship.The speed was so fast that Jiang Mu was unable to react to it.\u201cThis \u2026. She \u2026. What the heck is she after? Didn\u2019t she say she was here to find me! Why did she suddenly run away when she saw me!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t understand \u2026.\u201dLooking at Xue Menghan\u2019s back as she disappeared into the woods, Jiang Mu was scratching his head in confusion.At that moment, a strange misty fragrance came from behind him.A slight warmth could also be felt, turning around. There stood Ding Nanrong.Her long, beautiful hair was tied up high, and the blush on her cheeks had not yet faded completely.The purple-flowered silk nightgown hung over her voluptuous body. The neckline, which was modest, stretched open to its fullest extent by the offending curved object.The snow-white collarbone of her neck was still stained with crystalline droplets of water, and the steep cliffs of her delicate peaks could be seen faintly within.Overall, it looked like a buxom beauty that had been daintily hidden for years. Only her face looked indifferent.No? There seemed to be a little bit of\u2026 Unhappy?This made Jiang Mu\u2019s heart flinch for a moment.\u201cRong\u2019er, you\u2026 What\u2019s wrong?\u201dPerhaps it was because I was ogling at her just now, that she was weak in her heart now?Ding Nanrong stared at Jiang Mu and indifferently asked in a low but intimating tone.\u201cWhere have you been for the past two days.\u201d\u201cUh \u2026.\u201d Jiang Mu was startled and speechless.Shit. I almost forgot.Ding Nanrong, the personal attendant, was almost inseparable from me.She was not only responsible for my living but also keep my safety. Later is most important thing and meaning of her life. My life.Yet I took advantage of her to sneak out and fool around.If she was angry, she would beat me up.\u201cDidn\u2019t go anywhere, I was just casually fishing around, playing with the water, eating river food and looking at the mountains, there was no danger at all, really.\u201dJiang Mu had to make up a reasonable amount of nonsense.She didn\u2019t know if it was true or not, but could only accept it since he returned alive. \u201cNo next time!\u201dDing Nanrong coldly dropped a sentence before about to close the door.\u201cRong\u2019er wait! Why was Xue Menghan in your room?\u201d Jiang Mu hurriedly called out to her.But, her gaze suddenly turned cold as ice, and she looked at him.It also seemed to reveal a hint of \u2026. Killing intent?Jiang Mu felt a jolt, however, to know the truth about Xue Menghan\u2019s reason for coming here. He could only press on and cautiously open his mouth to ask\u201cRong\u2019er ah, Xue Menghan came here, what is she doing? I heard that she spent a day and a night here, you know that, right?\u201dThe tone of his voice was as soothing as possible, and he squeezed out a handsome smile, afraid that if she was not happy, she would beat him up.\u201cFuck off!\u201dBANG!!!The door slammed heavily, and Jiang Mu was left alone outside, squeezing, a twitching smile on his face.Damn it, I don\u2019t even know anymore, who the hell is the lowly maid here and, who\u2019s the patriarch!What the hell am I afraid of her for? Of course, afraid she\u2019ll kill me!Uh \u2026. She might really kill me for real. Jiang Mu instantly cooled down his anger.He clearly remembered the scene that there was a previous reincarnation in which he was displeased with her restraint and her disobedience.So he reprimanded her to her face, telling her to divide her respect and to pay attention to her status as a servant girl.The result was that she faintly returned, \u2018Is that so.\u2019Then, one almost lost his life.\u201cForget it, it\u2019s better to think for myself besides there\u2019s still the matter of Han Yuqing\u2019s sudden appearance here to think about.\u201d\u201cDamn, the Black Water Fury thing\u2019s sudden change is also mysterious. Ugh, no clue, I\u2019m tired mentally.\u201dHelplessly, he sighed and shook his head and went back to his room.These last two days of the hunting season had no storyline for him either.He planned to keep track of all the messed up plots and character changes through a diary.***In the hidden cliff cave on the treacherous cliff face.\u201cMaster, that Han Yuqing sees disciple\u2019s potential qualities.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why she will, on a regular basis, give me the cultivation resources.\u201d\u201cShe hopes to help her destroy the Xuanyang Sect in the future when I breaks through to the Void Refining Realm and I feel that she has a good vision.\u201dLing Aotian sat cross-legged and was consuming the spirit herbs and spirit medicines that Han Yuqing had given him to heal his injuries.At the same time, in his mind, he was communicating with the Black Water Fury.\u201cMaster, how is your recovery going? these individual demon cores, are they enough for your recovery of strength?\u201d[Not bad.]Inside Soul space, the Black Water Fury with a snake tail body absorbed the demon cores on the stone bed.Due to the large number of demon cores, plus the fact that there was one from the Transformation Realm, this allowed her strength to recover to seven or eight percent of what she had before.\u201cMaster, do you think, with so much potential, I will break through to the Martial God realm in the future?\u201d[Will.]Blackwater replied without a doubt, in the past, she was unsure.After all, apart from Ling Aotian\u2019s good luck, apart from his inexplicable confidence, being easily charmed by beauty, carrying the hatred of exterminating his village.There didn\u2019t seem to be many noteworthy points.The only thing that was still noteworthy was that he did whatever he was told to do by his master, a demon, I guess, but now, she had read the diary.After knowing that Ling Aotian was the male lead, she was absolutely sure that Ling Aotian, in the future, would definitely become a Martial God!\u201cHahahaha! This means that it was the Master who taught me well! It\u2019s what made it possible for the disciple\u2019s potential, to flourish! Hahahaha!\u201dLing Aotian let out a loud laugh. He was in a very good mood.\u201cMaster! This disciple has always believed that this is a world where the strong prey on the weak and only the strong, can have everything!\u201d\u201cDisciple, Must be the strong one!\u201dLing Aotian said proudly. In his mind, he also pictured the youthful and beautiful Xue Menghan.A graceful and bewitching Lu Chorou.Cold and mature Ding Nanrong.The charming and seductive Han Yuqing.Even, thought of the lovely little girl with the black dress, and long straight black hair, his master, the Black Water Fury!\u201cSo, I, Ling Aotian, am going to become a supreme being! Go and obtain what belongs to me!\u201dIt was probably because of the positive words from Han Yuqing\u2019s deal, as well as acknowledgement from his master, Black Water Fury.Ling Aotian\u2019s self-confidence was skyrocketing at this moment!It was as if he could see the overbearing image of himself becoming a Martial God, ruling the world, and surrounding himself with a beautiful harem all over the world lying under his feet![Not bad, only the strong can have everything.]Black Water Fury agreed with this statement very much.But she knew even more deeply that the mercifully strong would lose everything!\u2018One day, this God will also definitely make them, pay an unthinkable price!\u2019Muttering to herself, Black Water Fury\u2019s golden vertical pupils contracted extremely sharply.Suddenly. She had a feeling in her heart.So she immediately stopped absorbing the demon core.Summoning the Private Diary of Jiang Mu excitedly. There she saw that a diary had been updated.[March 10th, cloudy day.][My mood is even gloomier than today\u2019s cloudy day.][There are three women who are bothering me so damn much.]\u201cThree women?\u201d\u201cWill there be me?\u201dThe Blackwater Fury puffed her cheeks.There was very little information about herself that was currently recorded in the diary.So, she looked forward to diary updates every day.So today as well, she read the diary expectantly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ain\u2019t gonna come running out of the ring until it\u2019s necessary!][But the reality? not only did the she run out, she even blew up Sha Wuwen\u2019s stronghold, and even almost caused Ling Aotian to be killed by Sha Wuwen!][F*ck. My heart and body are tired and numb, and I want to drink happy fizz so badly.][This dead bitch, how come she\u2019s so Crooked somehow, despite staying inside Ring all the time?][Is this what they say, so-called \u201cone thing leads to another.\u201d][She\u2019s starting crooked now, so in the end, will she follow her self-sacrificing ending for Ling Aotian\u2019s sake, or will it change as well?]\u201cWhat? this god will sacrifice herself for Ling Aotian\u2019s sake \u2026. sacrifice?!\u201d\u201cHow is that possible!!!\u201dThe Black Water Fury\u2019s golden vertical pupils widened in disbelief.A face full of shock.[Anyway, it\u2019s funny as hell. originally, the author of this book didn\u2019t plan to do that, but wanted to give a satisfactory revenge ending.][But in the middle of the book, there was a ban on all kinds of things, including the affair between master and apprentice.][So, the author was so scared that he immediately changed the relationship line between the master and the disciple.][No, instead of changing it, it\u2019s more of a messed up version.][The dog author simply changed the beautiful ending of this little loli, Black Water Fury, into a tragedy by force, not only making her fail in her revenge. but even making her sacrifice for Ling Aotian. lol.][This not only made Ling Aotian a success and brought him closer to the Martial God realm. but also allowed Ling Aotian to carry on his hatred and Black Water Fury\u2019s revenge, spurring the development of the plot and inspiring conflicts, making the story even more ups and downs.][The end is even more beautiful, saying that it gives readers a \u2018beautiful strong tragic\u2019 image that goes deeper into their hearts.][After all, tragedies tend to move people the most.]\u201cImpossible!!!\u201d Black Water Fury\u2019s pupils snapped open.A ruthless killing aura burst out from Soul Space.It instantly filled the entire cliff cave. It frightened Ling Aotian, who was dreaming of his harem, so much that he almost prostrated.\u201cMaster\u2026 Master? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d[Shut up!!!] Black Water Fury roared viciously, scaring Ling Aotian into not daring to say a word.She stared at the diary with a deadly gaze, her face gloomy and tragic white.Her petite palms were still clenched into fists, making a \u201ccackling\u201d sound.\u201cThis god \u2026. Isn\u2019t this god the main female character? The end of the heroine\u2026 Isn\u2019t it all good \u2026.\u201d[I don\u2019t understand, why this damned bitch is crooked, I really don\u2019t understand, and then there\u2019s Han Yuqing.][Han Yuqing, this pervert, was supposed to be at Wuyou Sect today.][And where is she? she came to the Demon Beast Mountain Range to cause trouble!][She even met me, and to please me, she would even do anything and everything.][If I had nodded, I guess she would have been happy to be in the cave with me, fucking until the hunt was over.]\u201cHey, isn\u2019t it normal for a husband to fuck his wife?\u201d\u201cFuck for as long as you want oh, humph.\u201dHan Yuqing hummed a little tune as she looked at Jiang Mu\u2019s Private Diary and walked towards the outside of the Demon Beast Mountain Range.\u201cSince Husband doesn\u2019t want to see me now, I\u2019ll have to go find Miss Xue first.\u201d\u201cOtherwise, in this wild mountain range, I\u2019m scared~ that I\u2019ll be eaten by demon beasts.\u201dSuddenly. A bone-bladed leopard sprang out of the jungle.The leopard was as big as a buffalo and had bone spines as sharp as blades on its back, and its scarlet eyes were locked on Han Yuqing.With a howling sound, the leopard pounced on Han Yuzheng.\u201cYikes! It\u2019s a demonic beast of the Enlightened Realm~, I\u2019m going to be eaten, help~!\u201dChuckles~! A dagger\u2019s cold light flashed, and blood spilled out all over the ground.The Bone Bladed Panther\u2019s body, which was as big as a buffalo, was split in two.\u201cHey, hey, you couldn\u2019t eat me~, but I will eat you instead~.\u201dHan Yuqing laughed happily and wryly, using the dagger in her hand, dismembering the Bone Bladed Panther.[Damn, I wonder where this pervert is now. She wouldn\u2019t have gone to look for Xue Menghan, would she?.][After all, the City Lord\u2019s House\u2019s airship is so big, you can see it from a random high place, what will happen to these two in case she really finds Xue Menghan?][Both of them are my fiancee, If they get together, they should get along very \u2026. I think it would be harmonious.][After all, Xue Menghan hates me so much, she can\u2019t wait for Han Yuqing to be put in control of me, so I can\u2019t continue to pester her.]\u201cHan Yuqing?\u201dXue Menghan, who was sitting under a tree resting, looked at Jiang Mu\u2019s Private Diary in her hand and frowned in thought.\u201cWho\u2019s Han Yuqing again? Ah, come to think of it.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s also that bastard\u2019s \u2026. Fiancee!\u201d When she found out that Han Yuqing was also Jiang Mu\u2019s fiancee, Xue Menghan felt a strange feeling.It was an indescribable, not-so-comfortable feeling.First, she herself had a marriage contract with Jiang Mu, and that was in name only, and that marriage certificate was still kept in the drawer.But this woman called Han Yuqing is also Jiang Mu\u2019s fiancee!Only, this fianc\u00e9e, Han Yuqing, was verbal.It was Jiang Mu\u2019s last wish, left verbally by his parents, when they were dying a year ago, that Jiang Mu would marry Han Yuqing.At that time, Xue Menghan was very happy; although Jiang Mu was not a good person. He was a filial son.So he would definitely follow his parents\u2019 wishes and marry Han Yuzheng.As long as he married Han Yuqing, then he could not pester her.Yet now, when she learned that Han Yuqing was also Jiang Mu\u2019s fiancee.In her heart, she was, surprisingly, a little\u2026 Afflicted?\u201cMisconception \u2026. Is it?\u201d[When I go back, I\u2019m going to get married to this pervert Han Yuqing, although it\u2019s common knowledge that I love Xue Menghan.][According to my villainous persona, even after I marry Han Yuqing, I will continue to be a licking dog of Xue Menghan and even be willing to die for her.][But because I was lazy and arrogant, cultivating, often relying on herbal baths and getting high on pills instead of cultivating. Not seeking advancement, and thinking about fooling around all day instead of taking care of the Sect.][That\u2019s why I\u2019m not well liked by Xue Menghan, and I\u2019m even extremely loathed by her.]\u201cExtremely loathed? \u2026.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t \u2026 really\u2026.\u201dXue Menghan muttered.When she saw the sentence, \u2018Even after I will continue to be licking dog of Xue Menghan and even be willing to die for her\u2019Her face, unknowingly, flushed red.\u201cBah! Who cares if you go to hell for old mother, go to hell.\u201d[Damn it, if she loathes me, why would she still come to me? and even spend the night in my private ship?][What would others think? the heroine spending the night with the villain?][This is outrageous.!][I don\u2019t get it. I really don\u2019t know the cause of their change..][First it was Ding Nanrong\u2019s persona that was crooked. She inexplicably changed her look and asked me if I looked good.][Then it was Xue Menghan\u2019s persona that was crooked. She inexplicably came to me and went back without saying anything when she saw me.][Then came Black Water Fury\u2019s skewed persona, who for no reason at all blew up the Sandworm stronghold and almost turned me into her loyal slave.][Now it\u2019s Han Yuqing\u2019s skewed persona, as she inexplicably came to the Demon Beast Mountain Range and gave me a performance of meat cutting.][Haha, the collective persona is crooked lol.]Jiang Mu had just finished writing his diary and recording all these messy events.When he heard a knock on the door.It was Ding Nanrong, right? after he opened the door.Sure enough, it was her. She had already combed her hairstyle with two braids and put on a short purple bustier dress.Snow-white skin, foul curves, long slender legs, cold and beautiful face. It made Jiang Mu have to respectfully scan up and down a few times.\u201cI\u2019m going out for a while, stay well in the Thunderlight ship and don\u2019t dare you go out.\u201dDing Nanrong instructed him, and turned to leave.\u201cOkay.\u201dJiang Mu subconsciously replied, by the time he reacted, he could already see her jump off the ship.\u201cThis is all wrong! Who\u2019s the master and who\u2019s the servant anyway,!\u201d\u201cBesides, according to her persona, she would have stayed by my side at all times to protect me, and wouldn\u2019t have left me alone in the airship.\u201d\u201cWhere is she going now?\u201d Jiang Mu had a not-so-good feeling about it, a feeling that something was going to happen on Ding Nanrong\u2019s little outing.He was tempted to follow her up and find out what was going on, but Ding Nanrong was a cultivator of the Returned Origin realm.He couldn\u2019t keep up with her at all.\u201cForget it. Anyway, in the original book, whatever the various important characters do when they don\u2019t have their own plots won\u2019t affect the main plot.\u201d\u201cWell, assuming that what is done doesn\u2019t directly or indirectly affect other important characters.\u201d***Ding Nanrong soon arrived at the shore of the giant lake.With a slight jump, she flew and hovered right above the giant lake.Then, opening her arms, palms facing downwards, she indifferently spoke the phrase\u201cWater Element \u2013 Heavenly Curtain No Hidden.\u201dThe entire calm lake below, as if being pulled by something, suddenly became surging and turbulent.Swoosh!A giant pillar of water suddenly shot up from the surface of the lake and swirled upwards into the sky.After reaching high into the sky, the column of water spread out in all directions, as if it were a curtain covering the sky.The originally gloomy sky seemed to become even more gloomy and wet and cold as the curtain of water covered it.In just a few moments, the water of the huge lake drained, and in the sky, a sky-obscuring curtain of water of enormous size was appallingly formed!\u201cFall.\u201d Ding Nanrong\u2019s secret seal was induced.The curtain of water scattered, forming tiny droplets of water that spread out and fell towards the demonic beast mountain range below.The area covered was as wide as a hundred-mile radius!The tiny droplets of water.They fell on the flowers and trees.They landed in the mountains and rivers.They landed in the deep canyons.They fell on all kinds of demonic beasts.Of course, they also fell on human cultivators.The water droplets were so tiny that demonic beasts and human cultivators were unaware of them!Ding Nanrong stirred the water elemental power within her body and closely sensed it.Soon, she sensed that in the southeast direction, there was a woman\u2019s spiritual energy fluctuation that was very strong.\u201cReturning Yuan Realm \u2026.

If this reward had appeared earlier.He himself wouldn\u2019t have had to personally run to see if the Black Water Fury was crooked, and he wouldn\u2019t have been subjected to that \u2018Black Water Soul Eater\u2019 technique she had cast.Although he didn\u2019t get caught in the end, the two of them had already tied the knot.I had even thrown her down a hundred-meter deep sinkhole, and she was a vicious person with a grudge.This would more or less affect the subsequent plot!\u201cEr\u2026 But it seems to be better to see the Black Water Fury in person.\u201d\u201cAfter all, if I hadn\u2019t run over there myself, I wouldn\u2019t have absorbed her Black Water Poison, I wouldn\u2019t have grown the Poison Explosion Pill, I wouldn\u2019t have used the Poison Explosion Pill to sneak up on Sha Wuwen, and ultimately, I wouldn\u2019t have allowed Ling Aotian to kill Sha Wuwen in return, thus allowing the plot result from changing back.\u201d\u201cHmm, so how effective is this Celestial One Eye? Let\u2019s try it!\u201dUsing the Celestial One-Eye was very draining on mental energy, willpower, and spiritual energy.Therefore, Jiang Mu lay down on the bed and closed his eyes, with a chanting of the words in his mind.\u201cCelestial One Eye!\u201dIn a flash. Jiang Mu had a feeling of emptiness.It was like being in the darkness and his own soul floating out.And the vision that was looking down on the world below.As the vision slowly rose. The outline of the world below, too, gradually emerged from the darkness.Eventually, the land of the Cangling Boundary appeared within Jiang Mu\u2019s line of sight.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cSo the demon beast mountain range, it looks like this, it\u2019s really majestic!\u201dDirectly below the visual was the Demon Beast Mountain Range.It looked like a dozen ancient dragons lying side-by-side, with countless deep valleys and basins and peaks plunging into the clouds within, an area so vast that it was difficult to see it all at a glance.North of the Demon Beast Mountain Range is the Southern Realm, which is located in Li Zhou, the south-western part of the entire Kyushu Continent.To the south of the Demon Beast Mountain Range was the vast Southern Border Demon Realm, which was a paradise for the demon race.Yesterday, Sha Wuwen was holding his breath as he fled back to the Southern Border Demon Realm.It could be said that this demon beast mountain range, which stretched for tens of thousands of miles, was a small dividing line between the Kyushu continental state and the southern demon domain.And three years ago, it was in this Demon Beast Mountain Range that the Wuyou Sect had resisted the invasion of the Southern Border Demons.Jiang Mu lowered his vision, as the image below zooms in.Green mountains and green forests, waterfalls and streams, lakes and streams, birds and beasts, all could be seen clearly.\u201cWhat a convenient spying divine technique!\u201dJiang Mu then manipulated his vision, moving over there one moment, then the next while enjoying the scenery.Also in passing, he admired those cultivators, and how they fought demonic beasts.Within his sight on a certain wasteland, there were several male and female cultivators, surrounding and killing a wolf king. The battle was fierce.On the bank of a river, there are several male and female cultivators, fighting to force an eight-legged river pig onto the shore. The battle is fierce.On a mountain, there are several male and female monks using long-range spiritual techniques to attack a group of lion vultures. The battle is fierce.In a small forest, there are two male and female cultivators, clothed in disheveled clothes, interlocked \u2026.. The battle was fierce.\u201cNice guy, so white \u2026.. Eh watch out! There\u2019s a four-eyed hyena in the grass \u2026. Don\u2019t don\u2019t! Crap!\u201dJiang Mu\u2019s lower body tightened.The bloody image almost made him disable the Celestial One-Eye.He hurriedly moved his vision away. To look at something else.\u201cEh? Xue Menghan hasn\u2019t returned to her family\u2019s airship yet?\u201dJiang Mu was stunned to see that Xue Menghan, wearing a long emerald green dress, was sitting under a tree, her arm tracing the air.\u201cShe\u2019s got a twitchy hand?\u201dJiang Mu was amused by this scene.At this moment, a group of people entered his sight and they walked sneakily toward Xue Menghan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When did I, He Yunxiao, ever do anything bad?\u201dHe Yuanhao was exasperated and snorted.\u201cWhen have you ever done anything bad? The fact that you can lie at home and not go anywhere is a good deed for the people of Yinjing.\u201dHe Yunxiao patted his chest, and assured him, \u201cYesterday, I didn\u2019t do a single bad thing yesterday.\u201dAs father and son walked to the inner room, He Yuanhao opened his arms, and his aunt Zhang Jingxian skillfully changed his clothes.\u201cNot a single bad deed? Today, old Huang from the Ministry of Punishment even accused me, saying that \u2018He Yuanhao did not teach his son well and allowed his son to scold and abuse the sons of good officials\u2019.\u201dHe Yunxiao said, \u201cThat Huang Buren guy just needs a beating! What\u2019s more, if I beat him up, is that a bad thing? That\u2019s called removing harm for the people!\u201dHe Yunhao said, \u201cIf only you really had the heart to eliminate harm for the people! What kind of \u2018doing harm to the people\u2019 is fighting with him over a woman? It\u2019s just an act of passion. Also, your aunt has already told me about the 100 taels you spent on the cloth weaving in Jiangnan. You are willing to spend money for a woman, and you have never been so generous with your brother Chen Zimo! If the family doesn\u2019t pay for this, it will be deducted from your next month\u2019s monthly salary.\u201dOne hundred taels? Wasn\u2019t it a thousand taels?He Yunxiao looked at his aunt. Auntie glared back at him fiercely.He Yunxiao was very touched by the emotion.Thank you, Auntie, for saving my life!After half a round of words, He Yunxiao couldn\u2019t go on.There was too much black history, and if he continued, he would be beaten.He Yunxiao simply said, \u201cFather, please hire an imperial doctor for me.\u201dHe Yuanhao said indifferently, \u201cAre you going to die?\u201dHe Yunxiao thought to himself, \u201cAs expected of my father, father and son really do have a heart to heart!\u201cIndeed. I won\u2019t live long.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Hearing He Yunxiao\u2019s words, He Yuanhao was not in the least bit surprised. \u201cWhich piece of land do you fancy? Father will buy it for you.\u201dHe Yunxiao:? Is this my own father?He said without joking, \u201cI\u2019m really not lying to you! I\u2019m going to die soon! Have you heard of the Soul Devouring Pill? You won\u2019t live more than a year after you take it! So I consumed it!\u201dHe Yuanhao said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the taste?\u201dHe Yunxiao: \u201cNot too sweet, a bit bitter.\u201dHe Yuanhao: \u201cFine, a royal chef, right? Dad will hire one for you.\u201dHe Yunxiao said speechlessly, \u201cFather, I\u2019m really not kidding.\u201dHe Yuanhao changed his clothes, straightened them, and said, \u201cHold out your hand. Father will check your pulse.\u201dHe Yunxiao reached out his hand.He Yuanhao put both fingers on He Yunxiao\u2019s pulse, and when he perceived it carefully, he was delighted.The pulse was majestic and strong. His vitality was extremely tenacious, and his internal strength was not bad.When did this kid break through to the eighth rank? He must have been at least a while ago. He had to have entered the eighth rank in secret? Not bad, he has learned to hide his clumsiness.He Yuanhao was a man who had been through a lot of hardships, so he didn\u2019t show any of his thoughts on the surface.\u201cNonsense! You\u2019re obviously in perfect health! What kind of imperial doctor are you looking for?\u201dHe Yunxiao heard ten thousand horses galloping.Soul-devouring pills. I thank you! I\u2019m too healthy now! So healthy that I can only live for a year!\u201cXiao\u2019er,\u201d Aunt helping He Yunxiao out just in time. \u201cGo to the kitchen for me and see if lunch is ready.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201dThe purpose of seeing the imperial doctor had not been achieved, and He Yunxiao displayed an exaggerated look by drooping in dejection in front of his father.He was simply a zombie itself.As He Yuanhao raised his foot and prepared to kick the man, the downcast, He Yunxiao instantly regained his energy and immediately ran to the kitchen.\u201cMaster, Xiao\u2019er, he\u2019s really been doing quite well lately. At least he\u2019s willing to talk to us too.\u201dHe Yuanhao grunted.\u201cIt should have been so.\u201dHe then turned back to his room and rummaged through an iron box, opening it to reveal the very best tea leaves.\u201cJingxian, you went to the palace today?\u201dZhang Jingxian saw the tea and smiled, \u201cYes. I have an appointment with some sisters to meet the Empress Dowager. By the way, we will talk about the marriage between Xiao\u2019er and Nanzhu.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. When I was wounded in battle, I was fortunate to have the help of Imperial Doctor Wei. The day before yesterday, I happened to get this tea, which is of good quality. As you are going to the palace today, give this tea to Imperial Doctor Wei by the way.\u201dZhang Jingxian took the tea, pursing her lips and smiling. She knew that He Yuanhao could not face taking He Yunxiao to the palace, so she said thoughtfully, \u201cMaster, Xiao\u2019er has not been to the palace for a long time, and I think the Empress Dowager would like to meet the son of the marquis.\u201dHe Yuanhao waved his hand and said, \u201cAs you wish.\u201dThen he picked up his spear and went to the backyard to practice as usual.After lunch, He Yunxiao accompanied his aunt into the palace to visit the Empress Dowager.Of course, before visiting the Empress Dowager, there was a ghostly gate to cross.Auntie\u2019s friends were all ladies of various families, and they were not like the young ladies in bud. What\u2019s more, they don\u2019t care about the odd names that youngsters like He Yunxiao are naughty and mischievous enough to tune out. They were more concerned with practical issues such as whether he was handsome, useful and whether he was a first son.He Yunxiao is a big sister killer in this respect, exceeding all requirements, and there are not many beautiful women who wouldn\u2019t like him.Mid-untimely. Just after two o\u2019clock midday.He Yunxiao and Zhang Jingxian boarded the Marquis\u2019 carriage and rode leisurely towards the palace.Generally, married women were not allowed to let other men on the carriage casually. Some very sophisticated unmarried ladies would not share a carriage with someone of the opposite sex either.However, He Yunxiao was theoretically the son of his aunt, so there were no such scruples.On the carriage, Zhang Jingxian handed the tea to He Yunxiao and said, \u201cCome with me to see the Empress Dowager first, and after you have met her, you can give this box of tea to Doctor Wei.\u201dWhen he heard the words \u201cDoctor Wei\u201d, He Yunxiao knew that he would be able to see the doctor, so he said, \u201cThank you, aunt, for interceding on my behalf.\u201dZhang Jingxian covered her mouth and laughed lightly, \u201cWhat interceding? It\u2019s just that Master wants to send a gift to Doctor Wei and asked Auntie to do so. Auntie couldn\u2019t leave, so I asked you to help me.\u201dHearing this, He Yunxiao suddenly said, \u201cAuntie, the day before last, you applied medicine for me and used the ointment from the army. It couldn\u2019t have been the same one that old dad put on the table by hand, could it?\u201dThis time it was Zhang Jingxian\u2019s turn to be surprised.\u201cXiao\u2019er, I can\u2019t see that you have the skills to be a sheriff.\u201dHe Yunxiao grinned, \u201cAunt, I have a large number of skills.\u201dZhang Jingxian laughed, \u201cI will see later when you meet sisters, don\u2019t ask my help.\u201dHe Yunxiao recalled a painful lesson from the past and hurriedly raised his hands in surrender.\u201cAuntie must save me then!\u201dThe carriage could not enter the palace and stopped outside the side gate. After the guards at the gate had checked their identities, He Yunxiao and his wife walked into the most mysterious and majestic place in the whole of Qi.In the side rooms on the outskirts of the palace where guests were received, there were already several gorgeously dressed, beautiful women gathered.This was where the ladies had gathered to visit the Empress Dowager.As soon as they entered, before He Yunxiao could react, his aunt Zhang Jingxian was pushed aside.In his eyes, it was like a spring breeze passing through, and flowers were blooming.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019re Patriarch Jiang\u2019s maid.\u201cThe Demon Beast Mountain Range is full of dangers, so instead of guarding Patriarch Jiang properly, you came here alone?\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that Patriarch Jiang will get angry and expel you from the Wuyou Sect? Hehehe.\u201dDing Nanrong lowered her Water Lotus Sword and said back indifferently.\u201cNo one can expel me from the Wuyou Sect.\u201dHan Yuqing seemed to have an understanding.\u201cOh, I remember, because you once saved Jiang Mu\u2019s life, so Jiang Mu\u2019s parents wanted to take you as their righteous daughter. but you bent over backwards on your own and willingly became Jiang Mu\u2019s maid.She tilted her head again in disbelief.\u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t have left Patriarch Jiang half a step, you\u2019re neglecting your duty.\u201dDing Nanrong continued to say indifferently.\u201cSo what if I am.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHan Yuqing\u2019s crooked head almost choked on the wrong side of the pendulum.Sooooo Jiang Mu\u2019s personal attendant, Ding Nanrong, with her powerful Returning Element Realm cultivation, was doing what she wanted and disregarding sect discipline.Not to mention Jiang Mu, the Patriarch of the Wuyou Sect. Even the senior elders of the sect could not command her.When I saw her today, it was really like that.The only thing that Han Yuqing didn\u2019t quite understand.This woman, Ding Nanrong, why did she want to block her way?And judging from the hint of murderous aura emanating from her body.I\u2019m afraid\u2026 This wasn\u2019t good!Why?I haven\u2019t offended her, have I?Could it be that my plan to take over the Wuyou Sect has been leaked to her?Han Yuqing was inwardly shocked and uncertain.Pretending to be relaxed, she smiled wryly and said.\u201cRong\u2019er, you should know that in a few days\u2019 time, I will be marrying Jiang Mu and becoming the patriarch\u2019s wife, so you\u2019re not here to greet your future patriarch\u2019s wife, are you?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen why are you? I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve come to admire the scenery, have you? Hehehe.\u201dHan Yuqing smiled on the surface, but one hand was placed on her back, secretly making a seal.Ding Nan Rong\u2019s body surged with spiritual energy, and the Water Lotus Sword in her hand trembled slightly as a water dragon wrapped out of the sword and fell into the pool of water on the ground.Her gaze grew cold as she stared at Han Yuqing and said.\u201cI\u2019m here, to kill you.\u201dThe words fell with the cold wind.While Ding Nanrong had not yet moved, Han Yuqing was the first to do so.She stomped on the ground with one foot, splashing water, and her entire body exploded in place towards Ding Nanrong.The dagger in her hand \u201cbuzzed!\u201d The dagger in her hand emitted a strong mysterious light.It came up with the full force of a strike from the ninth level of the Qi Sea realm!\u201cXuantian Liuyang Slash!\u201dHan Yuqing\u2019s face showed an insane expression as she suddenly swung her dagger horizontally.A stream of light as strong as the sun shot out from the dagger and sliced across Ding Nanrong\u2019s abdomen!There was a poof.Ding Nan Rong was unexpectedly cut into two halves by the stream of light!But Han Yuqing didn\u2019t slacken.She did not think that Ding Nanrong, who was at the Returned Origin Realm, would easily lose her life to a full strike from the Qi Sea Realm.So after a successful strike.She didn\u2019t hold back.After passing over the \u2018corpses\u2019 above and below Ding Nanrong, she fled wildly straight towards the direction of Xue lord airship.As long as she escaped to Xue lord\u2019s airship, then she would be safe.After all, the City Lord, Xue Yuanshan, could not possibly sit idly by and ignore the safety of the future Wuyou Sect Patriarch\u2019s wife.Suddenly.Her body gave a violent lurch and she felt something tugging at her waist.Panicked, she looked down.To find that her waist was wrapped tightly around a dragon of water that had emerged from a pool of water!And behind her, Ding Nanrong\u2019s \u2018corpse\u2019, which had been cut up and down, turned into a puddle of water falling into the puddle on the ground. And in the blink of an eye, Ding Nanrong\u2019s form appeared before her!\u201cPresumptuous! You\u2026 How dare you kill me? You dare to kill the Patriarch\u2019s wife?!\u201dHan Yuqing\u2019s face was white as she slashed at the water dragon with her dagger in a desperate attempt to break free from its entanglement.Ding Nanrong slowly raised the Water Lotus Sword in her hand and said indifferently.\u201cIt is because you will be Patriarch\u2019s wife that you have to be killed.\u201d\u201cWhy! Where did I offend you!!!\u201dHan Yuqing roared in a tearful voice, slashing the water dragon with increasing haste, her hands, and feet already beginning to tremble.But the water dragon could not be slashed. Instead, it was getting tighter and tighter.\u201cYou have not offended me, but what you do in the future will hinder me.\u201dDing Nanrong said and thrust the Water Lotus Sword, towards Han Yuqing\u2019s heart.\u201cWait\u2026 WAIT!!!\u201dHan Yuzheng shouted shrilly.\u201cWhat other last words do you have.\u201dDing Nanrong stopped moving and stared at her indifferently.Looking at the sharp tip of the sword hovering in front of her heart, Han Yuqing\u2019s back broke into cold sweat with fright.Her legs went limp and she knelt at Ding Nanrong\u2019s feet on the spot.And with a trembling voice, she cried out in pain, saying.\u201cRong\u2019er! Sister Rong! You\u2026 Don\u2019t kill me! As long as you are willing to let me go, I \u2026. I\u2019ll do anything, please don\u2019t kill me!\u201dSaid thump thump thump! She repeatedly kowtowed her head.Her forehead was broken and blood flowed out.The blood slid across her beautiful cheeks and over the butterfly scar.It made her weeping face look, quite literally, eerie.Perhaps it was because of compassion that Ding Nanrong\u2019s face was slightly moved.The hand holding the Water Lotus Sword could not help but loosen its grip by half.\u201cXuanyang Yaoguangt! Go to hell bitch!!!\u201dHowever, then suddenly.Han Yuqing, who was kowtowing, her entire body emitted a dazzling light, and her long lake blue dress began to burst.In an instant, the water dragons that were wrapped around her waist exploded along with the dress.And her entire body, transformed into a dazzling white aura like the sun, shot up in place, and shot towards Ding Nanrong.The distance between the two sides was very close.Ding Nanrong was careless and her abdomen was penetrated by this white aura on the spot.\u201cPoof!\u201dA mouthful of fresh blood spurted out from Ding Nanrong\u2019s throat.With a bitter look on her face, she hurriedly covered the bloody hole in her abdomen.The Water Lotus Sword in her hand fell into the puddle of water, and then she squeezed up the knotted seal.\u201cWater Element \u2013 Origin Birth!\u201dThe pools of water on the ground around her instantly, one after another, transformed into a pillar of water.The pillars of water all gathered into the bloody hole in her abdomen.Clearly, she was healing from her injuries.\u201cHahahahahaha! Gotcha bitch! ahhahahahahaha!\u201dHan Yuqing let out a maniacal laugh as she succeeded in her sneak attack.But since she had used the Xuanyang Yaoguangt\u2019s secret technique.So much so that not only did her dress burst apart, even the skin all over her body, burst apart, forming a crack that streamed with blood.This was coupled with the dense scars all over her body.It made the whole person look like a beautiful doll whose fruit body had been destroyed.Ding Nanrong, who had always been unruffled, felt creeped out by the scars all over her body.Han Yuqing took advantage of Ding Nanrong\u2019s healing to turn around, and flee, not caring about her naked body.She didn\u2019t forget to leave harsh words behind like a Villain.\u201cWhen I become the Patriarch\u2019s wife, I will definitely peel your skin and tear apart Ding Nanrong\u2019s bones!!! Hey Eh \u2026.\u201dHowever.As she crossed a pool of water with her long strides.A water lotus sword, rushed up from the water pool.She was so shocked that her lower body jerked and she hurriedly side-stepped to avoid it.Unexpectedly, the Water Lotus Sword turned and stabbed her back.Chuck!The Water Lotus Sword stabbed her in the back of her waist, pinning her to the ground with a vicious her.\u201cAHHH!!! Let go of me!!!\u201dHan Yuqing screamed in agony.She frantically grabbed at the Water Lotus Sword in her back in an attempt to pull it out.However, her grip caused blood to trickle from her palms, but the Water Lotus Sword remained stubbornly still.Ding Nanrong, who had recovered from her injuries, leapt, and landed lightly in front of her.\u201cSister Rong! Please don\u2019t kill me!!!\u201dHan Yuqing\u2019s bloodied hands immediately grabbed Ding Nanrong\u2019s snow-white feet, crying, and begging.Forehead blood and tears stained her beautiful face.The appearance looked extremely miserable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t kill me! Don\u2019t!\u201dHan Yuqing\u2019s pupils seemed to be quaking.She was truly scared this time, truly feeling death.The ninth level of the Qi Sea realm, although it was infinitely close to the Return to Origin realm.But in the end, it was still the Qi Sea realm, a large realm apart, like a heavenly rift separating them.It was almost insurmountable!What\u2019s more, Ding Nanrong was still an innate Yuan body, far more powerful than ordinary cultivators.So from the very beginning.She, Han Yuqing, had no chance of winning at all!\u201cSister Rong! Good sister! As long as you don\u2019t kill me, I\u2026 Once I\u2019m securely seated as the Patriarch\u2019s wife, I\u2019ll give you heavenly benefits! No! I\u2019ll give you anything you want! I\u2019ll do whatever you want!\u201dHan Yuqing kowtowed and pleaded in desperation, no longer able to muster a single thought of resistance.As she kowtowed too much, the sword blade nailed to her waist cut wide and blood sprayed out like a spray, staining her snow-white and scarred back.But Han Yuqing ignored it, and continued to kowtow.Every time she kowtowed, blood sprayed out.Looking at this bloody scene, Ding Nanrong did not change her face and said indifferently.\u201cWhat I want, you can\u2019t give. If you want to blame, then blame the path you are taking, which contradicts my goal.\u201d\u201cWhat path! I\u2019ll change, I\u2019ll change!

As long as you don\u2019t kill,\u201dThe sword fell and the heart pierced.\u201cAh\u2026!!!\u201dHan Yuqing\u2019s kowtowing motion froze violently, her eyes rounded, and the howl from her throat resounded through the mountains.She was completely unable to accept this fact.It was also completely incomprehensible that she had no enmity or grudge against Ding Nanrong, so why would she suddenly come to intercept and kill herself.\u201cWhy \u2026. Why are you all doing this to me \u2026. I just want to live\u2026 I just want to kill that scum! Why won\u2019t you give me\u2026 Chance \u2026. Why\u2026 Why\u2026\u201dHer thoughts, as darkness descended before her eyes, slowly drifted into slumber.After confirming that Han Yuqing was completely dead.Ding Nanrong pulled the two swords out of her back and retrieved them into the ring.Probably because she could not bear to expose Han Yuqing\u2019s body to the wilderness.Then she cast the Water Dissolving Technique, and covered the water of the pond with her corpse, turning it into water together.Finally, it merged into the water pool.Just as she finished this.Then she heard the sound of panicked footsteps in the distance.She turned around and looked.He saw Jiang Mu panting, running out of the jungle.\u201cRong\u2019er! You\u2026 What are you doing here?\u201dJiang Mu searched around nervously.But there was no sign of Han Yuqing.His heart thudded and he hurriedly asked after her.\u201cRong\u2019er! Are you the only one here? Have you seen Han Yuqing?\u201d\u201cHan Yuqing?\u201dDing Nanrong didn\u2019t seem to have heard it clearly.Jiang Mu was busy saying this.\u201cYes! The one you also met a year ago is the daughter-in-law my parents personally identified, Han Yuqing, the pride of heaven of the Xuanyang Clan, my future wife and your future patriarch\u2019s wife.\u201d\u201cI met her, and after I had a sparring session with her, she left.\u201d\u201cLeft? Where did she go?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not interested in her.\u201dDing Nanrong returned indifferently, and then coldly asked in return.\u201cRemember I told you to stay well within the Thunderlight ship and you didn\u2019t listen?\u201d\u201cUh \u2026.\u201dDamn, this old virgin, she really doesn\u2019t give any face at all!Jiang Mu was so intimidated by her, could only say vaguely.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I heard\u2026 Han Yuqing has come to the Demon Beast Mountain Range, and I was bored staying alone in the ship, so I came out to see if I could see her.\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s go back.\u201dDing Nanrong nodded and headed off in the direction of the Thunderlight ship.Probably because she had killed Han Yuqing and eliminated this obstacle to her goal, she was in a good mood and didn\u2019t blame Jiang Mu for going out without permission.Damn, I always felt that this old virgin was strange.Jiang Mu was worried.He looked around the vast wetlands of the swampy forest once more.He found that apart from the two of them, and the puddle of water on the ground, there was no one in sight.There was no third person in sight.\u201cRoar\u2026!\u201dThe roar of a demonic beast suddenly came from the depths of the forest, startling Jiang Mu.There was no choice.He only had to follow Ding Nanrong\u2019s pace.He planned to go back and use his \u2018Celestial One Eye\u2019 to look for Han Yu Qing\u2019s trail.\u2026\u201cHoly shit!\u201d\u201cI forgot that the \u2018Celestial One Eye\u2019 could only be used once a day!\u201dHaving just returned to his private airship, Jiang Mu was troubled.It was because, the Celestial One Eye had already been used today.\u201cHow to fix this, do I have to wait until tomorrow?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t I use Void Divine Concealment and go to Xue Menghan\u2019s place to look for her?\u201d\u201cOtherwise it\u2019s really unsettling.\u201dJiang Mu paced around the room.

Why isn\u2019t she wearing any clothes!\u201dLooking at Han Yuqing, whose fruity body was sleeping on the floor, Jiang Mu\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cThe scars all over her body \u2026. What a freak.\u201dHe had seen Han Yuqing\u2019s body countless times, but every time he saw her legs, her waist, her arms, and legs, her back, again, these dense, ugly scars. He gets shivers.\u201cAs expected of a \u2026. A woman who often abuses herself!\u201dSilently sighed and Jiang Mu squatted down and gave her a princess hug.According to the progress of the original plot, the two of them were not married yet, so it was impossible for the two of them to have a substantial relationship happen.What\u2019s more, his own villainous persona hated her, therefore, even if she threw herself at him, there was no way he would cross the line by half.Jiang Mu hugged her without distractions and placed her on the bed, covering her with the blanket.\u201cAlas, there\u2019s no telling when she\u2019ll wake up and when she wakes up, there\u2019s no telling what she\u2019ll do to me.\u201d\u201cForget it, let\u2019s not worry for time being, my brain hurts.\u201dJiang Mu rubbed his temples and went to the table to sit down.It was probably because of the mental exhaustion caused by having used the Celestial One-Eye earlier, plus these bad events came up frequently.So much so that he was totally exhausted, physically and mentally.So he lay down on the table and slowly fell asleep.\u2026The other side of the uninhabited canyon.\u201cLord City Master, this is the stronghold of the Sandworm Demon Army.\u201dLing Aotian pointed at the huge, hundred-meter deep sinkhole in front of him and said to Xue Yuanshan.After he had been inexplicably beaten up by his master, Black Water Fury, this morning, he did not want to continue hunting demon beasts.So he returned to the Thunderlight Ship.Only then did he remember that Xue Yuanshan had previously said, \u2018There is a demon army stronghold hidden inside the demon beast mountain range with unknown intentions, if any of you can uncover it, the city lord\u2019s residence will have a heavy reward.\u2019So he was excited, and brought Xue Yuanshan and his party here.\u201cLord City Master, the day before yesterday, I happened to come here and discovered the stronghold of the Spirit Devouring Sand Worm Race.\u201d\u201cI even had a fought with the commander of this stronghold, Sha Wuwen but Sha Wuwen is a demon cultivator of the Transformation Realm, which is equivalent to a cultivator of the Returning Realm of our human race and I was only at the Gathering Spirit realm, so I was completely outmatched.\u201d\u201cFortunately, a senior who was travelling in the clouds passed by and she used the power of the Void Refining Realm to blow up this stronghold alive.\u201d\u201cSha Wuwen was also blown up and escaped, and I was saved.\u201dLing Aotian explained with a mixture of truth and falsehood.Xue Yuanshan nodded his head, indicating that he understood.His robe rose without a wind, and he floated up to the top of the celestial pit and began to examine the situation of the entire stronghold.The more he examined it, the more shocked he became in his heart.\u201cWhat a powerful spiritual technique, to be able to move a mountain flat, an ordinary Void Refining Realm cultivator can do it.\u201d\u201cBut to blast a mountain into a hundred-meter-deep sinkhole is definitely not an ordinary Void Refining Realm cultivator!\u201dXue Yuanshan held on to the bearded root and carefully observed the huge crater and see if he could find some useful clues.\u201cBased on the intelligence from the Dark Night House within the Demon Beast Mountain Range, there is a demon stronghold, so I think this must be it.\u201d\u201cThe intentions of this stronghold are unknown though but with a little pondering, one can make a guess.\u201d\u201cThis stronghold, most likely, is taking advantage of the hunting season being held to secretly observe and collect information on human cultivators\u2019 spirit arts, attack methods, clan children\u2019s cultivation realms, clan feuds, city conflicts and so on such information.\u201d\u201cSo that they can be used as a reference for the strengths and weaknesses of the future attack on our country.\u201d\u201cAnd with my Xue City directly facing the demonic beast mountain range, it is definitely the first point to be attacked!\u201dWorried thoughts followed one after another.Xue Yuanshan suddenly saw that there was a deep hole a person wide in the very middle.So he energised his spiritual power and swooped down, and with a bang, the mud flew up.His entire body instantly dug into the deep hole.This caused Ling Aotian to look secretly shocked.\u201cWhat a strong aura of spiritual power! Even more than Ding Nanrong ever had, worthy of being the Lord of Xue City! Worthy of being a Returning Yuan realm cultivator!\u201dLing Aotian knew that only when one reached the Return to Origin realm would one be able to float and fly in the air, and only at the Return to Origin realm could one be considered a true cultivator!There were six human cultivation realms.Spirit Gathering Realm, Qi Sea Realm, Returning Origin Realm, Void Refining Realm, Air Meditation Realm, and Martial God Realm.The Spirit Gathering Realm, which is only an introduction, has a single attack method, mostly based on physical combat, supplemented by spiritual arts.The Qi Hai realm, from the first to the ninth level, is the consolidation of the foundation, with complex attacks, mostly based on spiritual arts, supplemented by physical combat.The Return to Origin realm, on the other hand, is the watershed!When one reached the Return to Origin realm, one could use spiritual pressure, fly through the air. Invisible with a sword, and so on!Ling Aotian looked into his body in detail.After the battles of the past few days, especially coupled with his master\u2019s violent beating.It had made him vaguely feel the signs of breaking through to the Qi Sea realm!He was confident that with just one more hard battle, he would be able to break through to the Qi Sea realm!In this world where martial arts were the most important thing, only by becoming stronger could one obtain what one wanted!Including beauty! Ling Aotian\u2019s fists clenched, and his heart and chest lit up with fighting spirit.That blazing gaze could not help but turn to the young girl on the side.The young girl had long hair that reached her hips, and she was youthful and beautiful.That emerald green soft silk dress wrapped her sixteen year old figure to perfection!Xue Menghan, the number one beauty in Xue City!\u201cMenghan will definitely belong to me!\u201dSecretly thinking, Ling Aotian revealed an evil smile.He wanted to talk to Xue Menghan and draw closer to her only before he could open his mouth.He was interrupted by Xue Menghan, who frowned and said.\u201cYoung Master Ling, can you not smile at me like that, It make me\u2026 uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026 Ha\u2026 Ha\u2026\u201d Ling Aotian felt embarrassed and gave a faked laugh.At that moment. Xue Yuanshan drilled up from the deep low-lying hole and finally landed next to Xue Menghan.In his hand, he was still holding a black box.\u201cFather, what is this?\u201d Xue Menghan stepped forward and asked curiously.This black box, with clear textures, had eerie insect limb armor embedded around it.It looked and seemed so difficult to open, and Xue Yuanshan was unsure and said.\u201cIt might be something that Sha Wuwen accidentally left behind when he was escaping, let\u2019s go back and have a look.\u201d***The time came to night.\u201cWife.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t rub your bare back against my back.\u201d\u201cCome in front, squat down.\u201d\u201cKneeling is fine.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah, that\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cYeah! Bit deeper\u2026 Crap!\u201dJiang Mu sleepily mumbled and suddenly woke up with a start.He had originally slept on the table all afternoon.He ended up having a dream.\u201cI actually dreamt about that Han Yuqing.. \u2026?\u201dShaking his head off, Jiang Mu rubbed his eyes and looked around again and found that he was the only one.\u201cWait! Am I the only one? where\u2019s Han Yuqing!\u201dHe turned his head sharply and looked towards the bed. But all he saw was that the covers on the bed were neatly folded.There was no sign of the resurrected Han Yuzheng!\u201cShit, Where did she go?!\u201dSuddenly, from behind him, he felt a warmth.It was like someone\u2026 No, it was a woman!There was a naked woman, hugging him from behind!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was another kiss on the face, then there was a relief on his back.Then I saw that the door was open and closed again. Silence fell over the large, luxurious room.It was as if nothing had just happened, and after a while.\u201cWell, obviously, that woman just now, was Han Yuqing.\u201dJiang Mu wiped his face, having realized his thoughts.The only one who called him husband was Han Yuqing, and as for why Han Yuqing was in a transparent state. That must be because, she had used \u2018Void Divine Concealment\u2019.\u201cBut why is she suddenly about to return to the Sect? Didn\u2019t she say that she was afraid that I would be harmed by demonic beasts, so she came here to protect me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Doesn\u2019t she know that she\u2019s already died once? but looking at her reaction, I suppose she doesn\u2019t know, right?\u201d\u201cShit! Does she know or not!\u201d Jiang Mu was worried.Originally, he should have felt happy that he had saved Han Yuqing\u2019s life.But now? He was starting to worry again that Han Yuqing\u2019s three views would be shaken after learning that she had died once.In other words, it would affect her persona.\u201cNope! Affect my ass!\u201d Jiang Mu slapped the table in anger, and, cursing up into the air.\u201cDammit, her persona has been skewed for a long time, okay, and not just her, but also Ding Nanrong and the other female leads, they\u2019ve been crooked for a long time too!\u201d\u201cThe dog system didn\u2019t come out to explain, f*ck!\u201dHe felt like he had been pitted by the system to his grandma\u2019s house\u2026 No, to the grave of his ancestors!Although the system had given him a diary and told him that he would be rewarded for writing in it, but there was definitely something fishy somewhere in it!The most obvious place is in the persona of the female protagonists!They were all crooked and after much deliberation, Jiang Mu was 100% sure.This dog system, while letting him write the diary and giving rewards, it had secretly sent to the heroines.In other words, he had himself distorted the female protagonists\u2019 personas!And even the supporting characters like Ding Nanrong and Han Yuqing weren\u2019t spared!\u201cCould it be because this is the last reincarnation, so the dog system secretly distorted the characters\u2019 personas as a way to make it more difficult to pass the level?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s possible! Whatever, it\u2019s all f**ked up.\u201dJiang Mu was running out of options, and it was now the last reincarnation.Even though the system had secretly twisted the character\u2019s persona and increased the difficulty.He could only peacefully follow the plot, wish and struggle to make it right.Luckily, so far, the storyline\u2019s results were basically the same as the original storyline\u2019s.Take Han Yuqing just now, for example.She had said that she was going back to the Wuyou Sect, and when he went back as well, the two of them would get married.Then, from the original plot, it was back on track as well.After all, it was at the end of the hunting season that he himself returned to the Wuyou Sect and then got married to her.\u201cDon\u2019t think about it, let\u2019s have dinner, it\u2019s a nice night tonight.\u201dJiang Mu stretched out and took a plate of pastries from the table.Coming to the window, while taking slow bites as he admired the moon.\u201cTomorrow, is the last day of the hunting season let\u2019s hope it ends smoothly.\u201dThe moon was particularly full tonight, and so were the dark clouds.There was a large dark cloud slowly drifting by.It slowly began to eclipse the moon.The darkness gradually replaced the moonlight and enveloped the entire Demon Beast Mountain Range.It also enveloped the entire private ship.And it also overshadowed the woman hanging upside down below the window of Ding Nanrong\u2019s room.Han Yuqing!\u201cBitch, I finally understand why you want to kill me, Hmm.\u201dHan Yuqing stared at the Private Diary of Jiang Mu in her hand, revealing a grim smile.Originally, she couldn\u2019t figure out why Ding Nanrong had killed her.It was only after Jiang Mu had revived her that she remembered some of Ding Nanrong\u2019s information inside the diary.She read carefully, about the contents of Ding Nanrong\u2019s part in the diary.[When she was 12 years old and budding, that sect master was ready to take her, but she escaped, and then later, she came back and destroyed that small sect herself.][After her revenge, she tried to kill herself because she had lost her family and she couldn\u2019t find a meaning to live.][The only thing that keeps her alive now is to stay by my side, to see my Wuyou Sect completely decay and destroy itself, and then to kill me with her own hands.][Her reason is also bullshit enough, just because the patriarch of that small sect was my far, far, far room cousin, so she decided that my Wuyou Sect was the culprit. That\u2019s why she is willing to become my personal maid to protect the wasteful me while watching how I mess up the Wuyou Sect.]\u201cHeh.\u201d\u201cThis bitch, So that\u2019s reason why she is willing to become Jiang Mu\u2019s personal maid.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because, she wants to watch the complete decay and destruction of the Wuyou Sect with her own eyes, before finally killing Jiang Mu herself.\u201dAfter understanding Ding Nanrong\u2019s goal.Han Yuqing continued to flip through the diary and turn to the content about herself.[Oh yeah, according to the plot, the Wuyou Sect won\u2019t collapse, it\u2019s even getting stronger.][Because I will have a wife, named Han Yuqing, who is the pride of heaven of the Xuanyang Clan.][After she married me and became the patriarch\u2019s wife, she took over everything in the Wuyou Sect and slowly grew the sect later.]\u201cHeh! That means that Ding Nanrong, like me, also owns the Private Diary of Jiang Mu.\u201d\u201cShe knew that I would develop the Wuyou Sect in the future, so she killed me off in advance.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that she, who normally looks indifferent and uncontested, would be so ruthless as to kill me without a trace after her goal was obstructed.\u201d\u201cWhat a bitch. Tonight, I\u2019m going to kill you, heh heh.\u201dClosing the diary. Han Yuqing gave a charming smile.Then, with a quick seal invocation, she used \u2018Void Divine Concealment\u2019.The body then instantly became transparent and merged into the void.\u201cI never thought that Jiang Mu would give me an extra gift after reviving me.\u201d\u201cVoid Divine Concealment? This spiritual technique is not a normal invisibility technique.\u201d\u201cAs long as I use Void Divine Concealment, no method other than the divine sense of the Demon God realm or Martial God realm can detect my existence.\u201d\u201cAnd you, Ding Nanrong, are only at the Returned Origin realm, Just let me give you hell, okay? hehehe.\u201dHan Yuqing was so excited that her body trembled slightly.She slowly climbed up to the window and popped her head out to peer at where Ding Nanrong was located.\u201cAre you sleeping so early? Then I\u2019ll make it a Death bed.\u201dShe saw that Ding Nanrong was already lying in bed, asleep.Then she slowly crossed the window and gently landed on the floor.Then she took out her dagger.One step at a time, she walked towards Ding Nanrong\u2019s bed.One step\u2026Two steps\u2026Three steps\u2026Soon.Han Yuqing arrived at the edge of Ding Nanrong\u2019s bed.At the moment, Ding Nanrong was wearing a purple nightgown, her hands clasped together on her abdomen, her eyes tightly closed, her breasts swinging with each breath.The sleeping posture was enduringly beautiful.Looking at the wavy, sleeping beauty on the bed, Han Yuqing secretly praised from the bottom of her heart.\u201cIt\u2019s so big, it must be so soft when you lie on it, right? It\u2019s falling to the sides.\u201dAt the same time, she raised the dagger in her hand.Slowly moving the tip of the dagger, to Dingnan Rong\u2019s heart.Only to find that it was blocked by breast.\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of growing it uselessly so big, it\u2019s all blocking the heart, and you can\u2019t enjoy a man\u2019s caress.\u201dHan Yuqing made a speechless expression.And Then!!.The expression instantly became extremely hideous with bared teeth and inverted eyebrows!\u201cGo to hell bitch!!!\u201dBared!The dagger fell.Ding Nan Rong was stabbed through the heart on the spot.Her facial expression twitched, and her long legs instantly stretched out, but those hands that were clasped on her abdomen were slowly loosened and fell to the sides of the bed.She did not open her eyes until she died.After the blow was struck.Han Yuqing then pulled the dagger out.Then.\u201cGo die die die die die die die die die die die\u2026\u201dStab! Stab! Stab! Stab! Stab! Stab! Stab!***The next day.The morning was bright and sunny.Jiang Mu, who was sleeping peacefully, was awakened by a sharp smell.\u201cYawn~ What the hell\u2019s that smell .\u201dHe pinched his nose and woke up sulkily.\u201cWhy does it smell like -the smell of blood?\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s coming from the old virgin\u2019s room.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not visiting relatives, is she.\u201dMuttering, Jiang Mu briefly went to the bathroom to wash up.Then returned to the table and sat down.Calling up the diary.Eating a pastry at the same time.While starting to write today\u2019s diary, It was peaceful morning only\u2013.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For example, Han Yuqing \u2026. I don\u2019t want to talk about it. I\u2019m tired.][All in all, just one word: the personas of the female leads and supporting characters are fu**ed up so much, my head hurts!][At this rate, it\u2019s only a matter of time before their characters and the story itself fall apart, right?][Oh wait, the second female lead, Lu Chorou, isn\u2019t crooked yet\u2026 Maybe!][Damn it, I have a bad feeling. I bet Lu Churuo will definitely be crooked as well]Xue City, Dark Night Building. Inside the room on the seventh floor.\u201cI alienated the male lead Ling Aotian, I wonder if this is considered crooked?\u201dLu Chorou, who was wearing a blue silk nightgown, lazily leaned against the window, allowing the light breeze to brush her hair.She was enjoying the morning light bath while gracefully flipping through Jiang Mu\u2019s personal diary.\u201cAnd I wonder, when will I make my appearance again, will it be after the hunting season is over?\u201d[If it\u2019s today, there\u2019s nothing big happening. At most, Ling Aotian would be praised by Xue Yuanshan because he found the demon army stronghold.][Then Ling Aotian showed a wicked smile to Xue Menghan.][The result.][You can imagine that Xue Menghan, the silly dog, was blushing and falling for Ling Aotian once again. Hahaha, it\u2019s just hilarious.]Inside the City Lord\u2019s Palace\u2019s lightning ship.Xue Menghan, Xue Yuanshan, and Ling Aotian, the three of them were eating breakfast around the dining table.Xue Yuanshan praised Ling Aotian, saying.\u201cNot only did Young Master Ling discover the secret stronghold of the demon race, you also fought against the Transformation Realm\u2019s Sha Wuwen instead of retreating when he faced him, which is indeed courageous!\u201dLing Aotian took a piece of steamed bun, took a large bite and modestly returned.\u201cLord City Master is too kind, at first I also wanted to run back to give the news, but unfortunately, I was blocked by Sha Wuwen\u2019s men, so I had no choice but to fight for my life.\u201dHe said, and then looked across at Xue Menghan, who was drinking porridge while drawing air with her hands.Then he intentionally bit into the steamed bun without chewing it, revealing a wicked smile that he thought was handsome.\u201cI\u2019m full!\u201dDang! With a thud, Xue Menghan suddenly and angrily put the bowl down heavily on the table.Frightened, Ling Aotian choked on the steamed bun: \u201cCough \u2026\u2026\u201dXue Yuanshan was puzzled, \u201cMeng, why are you angry?\u201d\u201cNot angry! Father, I\u2019m going out to get some air.\u201dSaying that, Xue Menghan huffed and walked away.\u201cAhh, Young Master Ling, don\u2019t blame her, it\u2019s probably because the hunting season is almost over, and Meng is stubborn and playful, so she was not able to enjoy herself to the fullest and is sulking.\u201d\u201cAhem, no\u2026 It\u2019s alright, Lord City Master, that\u2019s too much, Menghan is simple and lively, she\u2019s in her youth, so it\u2019 s normal for her to be playful, cough cough\u2026 Goo!\u201dLing Aotian held his red face and forced himself to swallow the steamed bun.Then he laughed, his gaze couldn\u2019t help but chase after the doorway where Xue Menghan had disappeared.\u201cBlush!! my ass!\u201dAs soon as she was out of the doorway, Xue Menghan was cursing.\u201cDog Jiang Mu!

I remember, it wasn\u2019t today at all]Jiang Mu finished writing this sentence.Then he closed the diary, because he couldn\u2019t stand the smell of blood coming from Ding Nanrong\u2019s room anymore.\u201cIt\u2019s early in the morning, what the hell is this old virgin doing, is she killing a cow in her room.?\u201dJiang Mu got up and walked out of the room.He walked straight to the door of Ding Nanrong\u2019s room and raised his hand to give a knock.Duk duk duk duk duk duk duk duk duk!\u201cRong\u2019er!

I seem to have also gained an \u2026. ability?\u201dShe frowned slightly.Then, surprisingly, a line appeared in her mind that read.[Ability: Body of forced steel.][Description: When attacked, bounce back 100% percent of the damage of the attack to the opponent]\u201cWhen attacked, surprisingly, you can bounce back the attack\u2019s \u2026. 100% percent of damage to the opponent?\u201d\u201c!\u201dDing Nanrong opened her mouth in disbelief.According to the literal meaning, when one was attacked by an enemy, the enemy also took the same attack?!In the extreme. Suppose Han Yuqing came to assassinate her again now.Then, when one died, Han Yuzheng would also die?!\u201cAwesome! After Jiang Mu brought me back to life, I actually gained such a \u2026. special ability!\u201dFor the \u2018Body of forced steel\u2019 that she suddenly obtained.Ding Nanrong was nothing but shocked.At this time, There was another update to the diary.[Let\u2019s talk about Ding Nanrong first].\u201cMe?\u201d Ding Nanrong\u2019s attention was instantly drawn.[In the early days, her main identity was that of my personal attendant.][Apart from protecting me, she was also responsible for my daily life routine of getting up, eating, washing, etc.][In the middle and late stages, she began to become my daoist partner.][Well, that\u2019s the kind of daoist couple that does double cultivation.]\u201c!!!\u201dDing Nanrong\u2019s body stiffened, as if struck by lightningThe word daoist couple instantly shocked her head into blankness.Her eyes were wide as her blank mind filled with one word: impossible.[Because Ding Nanrong is an innate Yuan body, one of the Five Great Physiques, and has awakened the power of Water Yuan][And one night, while she was breaking through the Void Refining Realm, the Water Yuan Poison in her body suddenly flared up.][Since it flared up during the process of breaking through the realm, it was more serious.][How serious was it?][If she didn\u2019t find a man to drain the water, she would go off into the water and lose all her cultivation, and eventually die.][And it just so happened that that night, a handsome boy passed by the door of her room.][Ding Nanrong then abducted the handsome boy to her bed.][After that night.][She had matured.][The handsome boy had grown up too.][Well, yeap.

Oh! I get it!\u201d\u201cIs it because she knows she\u2019s been killed?\u201d\u201cThen, does she know who the killer is?!\u201dJiang Mu lit up with excitement.After all, back to back the two very main characters had somehow died, god knows how.If he couldn\u2019t find a reason for that, then it would be the equivalent of crossing the river blindly in later episodes.What if another female lead somehow died?That would be a very pain in the ass.\u201cGotta go over there and ask her!\u201d\u201cI hope I can find out why she died!\u201dSo he hurried out of the room and went to the door of Ding Nanrong\u2019s room.Raising his hand, he gave a knock.Knok! Knok! Knok! \u2026\u201cRong\u2019er, open the door!\u201dThere was a creak and the door was opened from the inside.\u201cWhat is it.\u201dDing Nanrong looked at Jiang Mu with an as usual expressionless face.\u201cRong\u2019er ah, that \u2026.\u201d Looking at the wavy, sleeping beauty in front of him, Jiang Mu made some slight calculations inside his mind and indirectly asked the matter.\u201cRong\u2019er, do you feel different, discomfort or anything?\u201d\u201cNot feeling.\u201dDing Nanrong indifferently returned.\u201cThen \u2026. do you remember what happened last night?\u201d\u201cWhat could have happened.\u201dEr\u2026. Did she not know that she had just died last night?Then why did she burst out of her spiritual pressure to crush me \u2026.Jiang Mu felt a pang of suffocation but pursued the question stubbornly.\u201cYou know like um, did anyone sneak into your room or something like that.\u201d\u201cSo what if there was, and so what if there wasn\u2019t.\u201dShit, this old virgin.Jiang Mu was too lazy to continue indirectly and asked straight out.\u201cDid you know that you died last night?\u201d\u201cFuck off!\u201dBang!!!The door was heavily shut and Jiang Mu was left standing alone in the doorway.What the\u2026.??? Did she know or not?Damn it! After standing for a long time in frustration.Jiang Mu had to leave helplessly.And inside the door, Ding Nanrong\u2019s heart, at this moment, was very unsettled, beating so fast.Although she didn\u2019t know how she would end up , but judging from the contents of the diary.Her own future daoist couple\u2026. would be Jiang Mu!Once the two had become a daoist partner, it would be impossible for her to kill Jiang Mu and destroy the Wuyou Sect.\u201cHow about\u2026I just Kill that bastard Jiang Mu now and be done with it? After that, slowly cultivate to the Void Refining Realm, and then Massacre Wuyou Sect in the future?\u201dDing Nanrong\u2019s gaze gradually turned grim.The coldness then dissipated, shaking her head. She denied the idea.\u201cIt\u2019s stated in the diary that during my breakthrough to the Void Refining Realm, the Water Element Poison will kick in.\u201d\u201cOnce there is no man\u2019s \u2026.to help, my body will go berserk and die.\u201d\u201cAnd at the moment \u2026. I seem to be interested in Jiang Mu \u2026. and really \u2026. not reject \u2026. it.\u201d\u201cBut if I don\u2019t kill Jiang Mu and destroy the Wuyou Sect.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s the point of what I\u2019ve been doing for the past three years?\u201d\u201cWhat should I do now \u2026\u2026\u201d Ding Nanrong leaned quietly against the door of her room and slowly closed her eyes.She felt like a small boat drifting in an endless sea, unable to find her way.Jiang Mu returned to his room.Summoned out his diary.\u201cUgh, I\u2019m mentally tired, let\u2019s just get today\u2019s reward, for now and rest.\u201dAnd sat down, proceeded to write in the diary.[Ding Nanrong, doesn\u2019t know that she died once, I think][Because she still had a cold and indifferent look, with no emotional ripples.][How can a normal person who knows that they just died and came back to life and still be calm and indifferent?][Like shocked, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not dead?!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been reborn?!\u201d \u201cThis is the Otherworld?!\u201d .That should be the case, freaking. dripping in cold sweat\u2026..][And in Han Yuqing\u2019s case, I guess she didn\u2019t know she died once either.][Otherwise, last night, she wouldn\u2019t have said nothing more and run back to the Wuyou Sect after kissing me twice.][Counting the time, she should have returned to the Wuyou Sect by now.]On a certain green laneway, young and beautiful woman wearing a long lake blue dress was walking leisurely, in the direction of Jiang Mu\u2019s private lightning boat.She looked at the diary in her hand, and every now and then, she revealed a wry smile.\u201cSince that bitch owns the diary, she is sure to kill Jiang Mu after she knows her purpose won\u2019t be achieved, right?\u201d\u201cOnce Jiang Mu is dead, I won\u2019t be able to become the Patriarch\u2019s wife or get Wuyou Sect under my control and kill that scum.\u201d\u201cHey, my good husband, I\u2019m coming back to save you now and kill that bitch for you.\u201d\u201cYou must thank me properly in bed later.\u201d\u201cHehehe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It didn\u2019t look like a powerful spiritual art.Rather, it looked like a kind of chat room used for blowing off steam.\u201cChatting between spirits?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell.\u201d Jiang Mu wanted to try this \u2018Soul Book\u2019.See what effect it had, so with the thought in his mind. He summoned the book.\u201cSoul Book!\u201dBuzz!With his body as the center, a dark circle was generated, the circle expanded instantly.It only stopped when the radius reached 10 meters.\u201cThe radius is only 10 metres, that must be because my cultivation realm is too low.\u201dWithin the entire dark space.A light man, and a book of light appeared.The light person in it was Jiang Mu himself.\u201cThis glowing state of mine is the soul state?\u201dJiang Mu looked around himself once and found that his height, body shape and all, had not changed, just like myself.But because it was in a state of light, the outline was a bit out of frame, and no face could be seen.\u201cThat book of light, it\u2019s Ding Nanrong\u2019s soul, right?\u201dJiang Mu could see, the location where that book of light was located was exactly Ding Nanrong\u2019s room.\u201cBut her soul, why is it in the shape of a book?\u201d\u201cOh, books are the ladder of human progress.\u201d\u201cI guess the system deliberately made the human soul, in the shape of a book, to indicate the progress of humanity.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite thoughtful, well\u2026. Should I try summoning Ding Nanrong\u2019s soul in for a chat?\u201dJiang Mu was tempted to give it a try, but he was afraid that it would affect her three views and lead to affecting the plot.\u201cWell \u2026. It should be fine, after all, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m in the main character here, not to mention she can\u2019t see my face.\u201d\u201cRight, how about pretending to pretend to be a higher power and ask her again if she knows she died? perfect. Let\u2019s do that!\u201dJiang Mu was eager to find out how exactly Ding Nanrong had died.So he stared at Ding Nanrong\u2019s light book soul, with the thought of his mind.The next moment, the light book transformed into Ding Nanrong\u2019s human form.The shining Ding Nanrong seemed to feel a moment of confusion and shock.When she saw Jiang Mu, she clearly froze still and then immediately afterwards, she became alert and asked.\u201cWho are you? What is this place?\u201dDing Nanrong was horrified to discover that her own soul had, in fact, entered a closed dark space, but she could sense the original body, still sitting in front of the dressing table in the room.As for the man in front of her, she couldn\u2019t see his face, so she didn\u2019t know who it was.Could it be some kind of worldly superior?But this tall man\u2019s figure \u2026. How come it looks so much like Jiang Mu?Perhaps there was only Jiang Mu as the only man that could come into her mind.So that the first time she did, she substituted Jiang Mu for the person in front of her.\u201cAhem, it\u2019s not important who I am, what\u2019s important is, who are you?\u201dJiang Mu put his hands behind his back and lowered his voice, making a gesture of a superior person.\u201c!\u201dDing Nanrong didn\u2019t answer. Her face was grim as she subconsciously tried to take out her Water Lotus Sword to be on guard.However, she found that she was in her soul state and could not use the Soul Ring.This action of hers was seen by Jiang Mu and laughed in his heart.This old virgin, she was really cautious. She couldn\u2019t move without taking out her sword.Jiang Mu waved his big hand, made a bullish look, and said in a profound manner.\u201cLittle girl, don\u2019t panic, I am an Immortal of the Sea of the Primordial, my name: Immortal Niu Bai.\u201d\u201cImmortal\u2026 Immortal?!\u201dDing Nanrong\u2019s pupils shrank and her mind trembled with fear.She had once had the honor of spying on ancient ruins.In the records of the ancient monuments, a hundred thousand years ago, in the Cangling Realm, there had been immortals, and there were originally seven cultivation realms.They were: the Spirit Gathering Realm, the Qi Sea Realm, the Returning Origin Realm, the Void Refining Realm, the Empty Meditation Realm, the Martial God Realm and the Immortal Realm.But then for some unknown reason.The Immortal Realm cultivators suddenly disappeared, and after that, no one could ever break through to the Immortal Realm again.So, Immortals, then, became a legend in the Cangling Realm.Ding Nanrong slowly recovered from her shock.She was not sure if the man in front of her was an Immortal or not, but one thing was certain.The man in front of her must be at a very high cultivation level!At least higher than her!If not, how could he have easily summoned her soul into this\u2026 closed dark space? but why did he summon me?Ding Nanrong couldn\u2019t understand the other party\u2019s intentions and could only ask in a respectful tone.\u201cDare I ask Immortal Niu Bai, why did you summon the soul of little girl in here?\u201dHa, this old virgin, she really believed it, but thinking about it.Her soul was suddenly pulled in by me without a sound, so must have thought I was a big shot.\u201cThis immortal summoned you in just because I was bored and wanted someone to blow off steam and chatter er \u2026. Just chatting to relieve the boredom.\u201dJiang Mu explained casually, then thought about how to find out from her, who the person who killed her was.After some slight deliberation, he wasn\u2019t going to ask her directly if she had died once and who had killed her.Rather, he first shaped his own immortal character to convince her completely, and then, in a low voice, he said.\u201cLittle girl, this immortal has observed your life.\u201d\u201cYour name is Ding Nanrong, and you are an innate Yuan body, an awakening of the power of the water element.\u201d\u201cWhen you were four years old, your entire family was killed.\u201d\u201cWhen you were twelve years old, you were almost robbed of your Yin Yuan.\u201d\u201cWhen you were seventeen, you destroyed the Langqing Sect.\u201d\u201cWhen you were twenty-one, you reached the Returned Origin Realm and your youth has lasted forever since.\u201d\u201cWhen you were twenty-two, you saved the Young Patriarch of the Carefree Sect, Jiang Mu, and became his personal maid.\u201d\u201cEverything you have done since then has been simply for revenge.\u201d\u201cYet just last night, your good fortune suddenly ran out and you died.\u201d\u201cToday, however, you have suddenly been reborn again.\u201d\u201cI wonder, is this Immortal right or not?\u201dWhat?!!!This immortal \u2026. actually knows everything about me?!!!Shocking waves stirred up in Ding Nanrong\u2019s heart.In that case \u2026. He must know my end as well, could he really be an immortal?!Ding Nanrong\u2019s tone became even more respectful as she cupped her fist and said.\u201cThe immortal Niu Bai knows the divine mystery! Little girl is deeply shocked and in awe!\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dJiang Mu nodded lightly, expressing his satisfaction.Haha. It was the first time I saw her look this respectful.Sure enough, in this world, it\u2019s all about the strongest.Oh yeah, I\u2019ll have to ask her if she knows who killed her, but I couldn\u2019t spoil my image of her as an all-knowing person.So one could only pretend to be profound once again and ask.\u201cThis Immortal knows the cause of your death, but this Immortal wants to hear it from your own lips, so, how did you die? Do you remember if anyone kill you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What\u2019s the point of calling you if you don\u2019t know the answer!Jiang Mu was ready to kick her out of the chat room.\u201cWait\u2026 Wait a minute!\u201dDing Nanrong\u2019s heart was burning with anxiety.She didn\u2019t want to leave just like that.After all, the Niu Bai immortal in front of her was someone who knew the end of her fate!If she left, she doesn\u2019t know when she would see it again.So she hurriedly asked respectfully and nervously.\u201cMay I ask Immortal Niu Bai, what is the end of this little girl\u2019s fate \u2026. What is it?\u201dOf course, you will be buried vertically with me, happy with that?But Jiang Mu couldn\u2019t tell her.Otherwise, it would seriously affect her persona and cause the plot to deviate.So he said blandly and majestically.\u201cHeavenly information cannot be revealed, this immortal can only tell you that as long as you follow the path of fate, you will be happy and joyful for the rest of your life, and your ending will be a happy one.\u201dSaid the end.Not bothering to listen to her further cry, he directly kicked her out.So Ding Nanrong\u2019s soul, changed back to the form of a light book.\u201cThe rest of my will be happy and joyful \u2026.\u201d\u201cMy ending will be good \u2026.\u201dDing Nanrong, whose soul had returned to the room, was in a bit of a trance.The events of today were too great a shock to her.She didn\u2019t doubt the contents of Jiang Mu\u2019s diary in the slightest.Nor did she doubt in the slightest the words spoken by that immortal just now.\u201cThe premise is \u2026.\u201d\u201cAs long as I follow the destiny path \u2026..\u201dDing Nanrong was silent.If it were possible, who wouldn\u2019t want to be happy and fulfilled in life?She couldn\u2019t help but recall, at the age of four, the time when.[In the courtyard under the stars, she sat on her father\u2019s broad shoulders, the curved moon within reach.][Her mother\u2019s carefully roasted lamb, so gluttonous that father and daughter abandoned the moon and came running to feast on it.][Grandmother\u2019s voice was still ringing in her ears as she tapped her cane, \u2018Look at you two, father and daughter, you don\u2019t have a face to eat. \u2018Rong\u2019er, don\u2019t be like your father.

Wouldn\u2019t more characters be resurrected one after another?And I will lose my rewards, one after another?\u201cDog system!\u201dJiang Mu cursed and went to bed, laid down, closing his eyes.Since he didn\u2019t have much to do today, he was sitting around waiting for the hunting season to end tomorrow.So he planned to use the \u00b4Celestial One Eye\u00b4.Mainly, he wanted to see.Ding Nanrong, Xue Menghan, Ling Aotian and Black Water Fury, Lu Chorou, Han Yuqing, what all these people were doing.\u201d The Celestial One Eye!\u201dIn the darkness, Jiang Mu\u2019s vision slowly rose.The outline of the world below also gradually emerged from the darkness.Eventually. A map of the Cangling Boundaries appeared.Jiang Mu lowered his vision.The image below is also enlarged.\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at Ding Nanrong first.\u201dJiang Mu positioned the image, precisely, to his own private ship.It was also positioned at the location of Ding Nanrong\u2019s room.He concentrated his mind and looked down through the deck of the airship.Inside the picture, Ding Nanrong, dressed in a purple silk nightgown, was sitting in front of her dressing table.She was staring blankly at her half-raised hand.By the looks of it, it seemed to be in contemplation?\u201cThis old virgin, who is ruthless outside and doesn\u2019t talk much, is very quiet in her room.\u201d\u201cBut this quiet and docile look of hers, it\u2019s truly beautiful.\u201dJiang Mu admired it, and then prepared to move the picture to Xue Menghan\u2019s side.At that moment, Ding Nanrong stood up.Coming to the standing mirror.\u201cWell \u2026. She should be getting ready to change her clothes.\u201dJiang Mu saw.Ding Nanrong looked into the mirror and turned sideways, looking at the curvy shape of her figure.\u201cHmmm \u2026. An undeniable S.\u201dThen, Ding Nanrong put her hands in her chest position and grabbed the edge of the dress in the bust.Then with a little effort.Tearing it away to the sides.Boing! Boing~Startled, Jiang Mu accidentally enlarged the image by a billion points.Ding Nanrong used both hands to hold it up, not finding any hard lumps.Only then did she walk to the clothes rack with a swing.Raising her hand, she put an exaggerated fabric over it.Then she put on a short purple bustier dress.Then sat down at the dresser and put on a two-braided hairstyle.\u201cWell, I guess she\u2019s going to start meditating and cultivating.\u201dJiang Mu was well aware of Ding Nanrong\u2019s cultivation time frame.If there was nothing going on, she would basically meditate and cultivate in the morning, meditate and cultivate at noon, take a bath at night, and meditate and cultivate again.\u201cMeditating and cultivating every day, isn\u2019t that tiring.\u201dWhether it was the villain persona or herself, Jiang Mu couldn\u2019t stand this boring cultivation life.\u201cUm? She\u2019s not meditating and cultivating today?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing in the bathroom.\u201dJiang Mu felt strange.It was because Ding Nanrong didn\u2019t start meditating and cultivating.Instead, she entered the bathroom.She cast the secret technique \u2018Water Elemental Splitting Technique\u2019.Taking a large amount of water, she shaped it into a water body that looked exactly like herself.\u201cIs she going to cultivate the splitting technique today?\u201dJiang Mu saw.The water-splitting body, Ding Nanrong, was sitting on a futon, meditating with her eyes closed.The main body, Ding Nanrong, on the other hand, was away from the split body and stood in a corner, her gaze fixed on the split body.\u201cWhat is she doing, is she trying to test the durability of the doppelganger.\u201dJiang Mu didn\u2019t quite understand her move.So curiously, he continued to watch, wondering what she was up to.An hour and a half later.\u201cCan\u2019t do it dizzy.\u201dJiang Mu started to feel dizzy and weak.This was the result of the excessive consumption of mental power, willpower, and spiritual energy from the \u2018Celestial One Eye\u2019.\u201cFuck, wasting old me\u2019s time.\u201dJiang Mu regretted it.He hadn\u2019t expected it.A full hour and a half had passed.Ding Nanrong actually didn\u2019t move for a single moment.The doppelganger had been sitting on the futon and meditating.The main body, however, kept standing in the corner, staring at the doppelganger in silence.\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t, I want to vomit.\u201dJiang Mu was forced to lift the \u2018Celestial One Eye\u2019 and prepared to withdraw from the image.However.\u201cCrap! What the hell!!!\u201dJust at the moment when the screen was just about to withdraw.Jiang Mu was horrified to see this.The head of the water doppelganger, Ding Nanrong, was suddenly sliced open by something!It rolled down to the ground!!!(TL: Sorry guys, I got busy with my work because of sudden mess-up. But It\u2019s dealt with, so as before there\u2019ll be updates regularly.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Where are you!\u201d Jiang Mu decisively pushed the door in.He searched Ding Nanrong\u2019s room inside and out, but couldn\u2019t find her.On the futon used for cultivation, only a puddle of water was left behind.That was what Ding Nanrong\u2019s watery body had turned back into after her doppelganger died.\u201cCould she have jumped out of the window?\u201d Jiang Mu came out the window.Probing his head, he looked around outside the window.Outside there was only a vast landscape of flowers and trees, green forest rocks, and occasionally the joyful chirping of birds could be heard and the scent of the primeval forest could be smelled, but there was no one in sight, as far as he could see.\u201cDamn it, where the hell did she go.\u201d***In the dense forest, Ding Nanrong\u2019s figure was like a wind, moving agilely through the forest.\u201cStop, I won\u2019t kill you, let\u2019s talk.\u201d She shouted into the air ahead of her.Although there was no one in front of her, she could sense that Han Yuqing was in a stealthy mode, fleeing from her chase.\u201cYou can\u2019t get away, when you killed my water elemental doppelganger, the water elemental power of my doppelganger attached itself to you.\u201d\u201cNo matter where you hide, I will find you, so don\u2019t force me to attack.\u201dAfter saying that, Ding Nanrong took the initiative to stop.Quietly, she looked at the empty front space.After a while, ahead of her, something appeared out of nowhere, a long-haired beauty holding a dagger.She was dressed in a long lake blue dress, and her beautiful cheek had a butterfly scar that looked eerily charming.Han Yuqing, who had come back to kill Ding Nanrong.Unfortunately, she failed. I didn\u2019t expect to kill just a doppelganger.Han Yuqing tightly gripped her dagger, her eyes cautiously and fearfully staring at Ding Nanrong.However, when she spoke, she smiled in a fake light-hearted manner.\u201cOops, it\u2019s sister Rong, what do you want to talk to me about, I have to rush back to the Wuyou Sect\u2019s hehe.\u201d\u2018To talk about the matter of you and me dying and coming back to life, let\u2019s just pretend that it never happened. Let\u2019s forget the grudge.\u2019Ding Nanrong wanted to say these words out loud but couldn\u2019t.It was as completely unutterable as a diary note.After some serious thought, Ding Nanrong racked her mind to get the right words to settle the feud between them with these words.\u201cI believe in fate, and I will follow the path of fate.\u201d\u201cFollow the path of fate??\u201dHan Yuqing froze for a moment. She then carefully read the meaning of this sentence.Not half a second later, she widened her eyes.So that means that this bitch \u2026. would go according to what the diary said?So she hastily summoned the diary and quickly read the latest update about Ding Nanrong:.[If it wasn\u2019t for watching the Wuyou Sect being destroyed little by little at my hands, and then finally killing me herself, thus satisfying that thrill of revenge for her, she wouldn\u2019t have forced herself to become my personal maid.][It\u2019s a pity that she sacrificed so much, because her purpose could not be achieved lol.]Since she had the diary, the bitch must have known that her own purpose would not be fulfilled.If it goes as the diary says, then it means that this she\u2026. would become Jiang Mu\u2019s daoist partner!Han Yuqing\u2019s hand moved as she continued to flip through the diary:.[Her main identity in the early days was that of my personal maid.][Apart from protecting me, she was also responsible for my daily routine of getting up, eating, washing, etc.][Only in the middle and later stages did she begin to become my daoist partner.][After she gave me her yin yuan.][She would never be able to leave me.]Looking at Han Yuqing\u2019s hand, she traced the movement in the air.Ding Nanrong nodded secretly: indeed, Han Yuqing also possessed Jiang Mu\u2019s Private DiaryIn fact, she wasn\u2019t quite sure at first whether Han Yuqing also had the diary in her possession.Then she thought about it carefully.If Han Yuqing possessed the diary, then, according to her nature of seeking revenge, when she knew that Ding Nanrong had been resurrected, would she return to kill her?If she did return to kill, that would mean.Han Yuqing definitely had the diary!Now it seemed that her suspicions were 100% correct.Han Yuqing closed the diary.It became clear at once that this bitch knows that I possess Jiang Mu\u2019s Private Diary.Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have, inexplicably, made a point of saying to me something like \u2018I will follow the path of fate.\u2019Thinking, Han Yuqing gruffly asked.\u201cCan you tell me, why do you suddenly want to follow the path of fate?\u201cBecause what you\u2019ve done all these years \u2026. wouldn\u2019t all go in vain?\u201dDing Nanrong blandly returned.\u201cBecause, I am already satisfied, with my future destiny.\u201dAfter meeting the Senior Immortal Niu Bai earlier in that mysterious dark room, her thoughts became clear.And so, after deep consideration, she had made a decisive choice.First, the Immortal Niu Bai had told her that if she followed her destiny, the rest of her life would be happy and end well.She had no doubt about this.Secondly, she had already disobeyed the first half of her mother\u2019s wish, and now she wanted to try to fulfill the second half of her mother\u2019s wish.On the night when she was four, her mother, collapsed in a pool of blood, dying, holding half a blood-stained piece of roast lamb in her trembling hand, smiled lovingly, and said to the sobbing her: \u2018Rong\u2019er be a good girl. Don\u2019t cry\u2026. Remember mother\u2019s words, protect \u2026. Don\u2019t let hatred move you\u2026. Don\u2019t be blinded by hatred\u2026.. In the future you \u2026. You must learn to roast lamb\u2026 Tie your husband\u2019s stomach \u2026. And teach\u2026 Your\u2026 children\u2026 Roast lamb\u2026 Meat \u2026. I .. want ..You live.. Happy\u2026 life\u2026..\u2019Her mother did not want her to embark on a thorny path of vengeance.Rather, she wanted her daughter to have a happy family in the future.Originally, she had no feelings for men and she didn\u2019t think she would ever fall in love with a man in this life, let alone form a family.But now, since she didn\u2019t feel repulsed by Jiang Mu, then why not give it a try?Ding Nanrong looked at Han Yuqing and suggested.\u201cBetween you and me, let\u2019s get even and just pretend that nothing has happened.\u201d\u201cIn the future, let everything go as it comes, how about that?\u201dWith that, she took out a Water Lotus Sword and quietly, she waited for Han Yuqing\u2019s answer.\u201c\u2014\u201dThe corners of Han Yuqing\u2019s mouth twitched slightly.She\u2019s clearly threatening me.However, since she was willing to go by what the diary said.That seemed to be to my \u2026. advantageous?No, I should say it\u2019s very beneficial!Han Yuqing\u2019s eyes gradually brightened.It was because she herself would be Jiang Mu\u2019s wife, the Patriarch\u2019s wife, and once Ding Nanrong became Jiang Mu\u2019s daoist partner, she would be one of their own! A good sister!The most important point, Ding Nanrong would surely break through to the Void Refining Realm in the future!Then, when the time comes to attack, Xuanyang Sect, Ding Nanrong will be a powerful asset!She must have a good relationship with this bitch!Besides, now that she was covered in the power of Water Element, even if she used Void Divine Concealment, she wouldn\u2019t be able to escape this bitch\u2019s pursuit!If I didn\u2019t agree with her, she would definitely kill me again!So\u2026. \u201cSister Rong!\u201dHan Yuqing suddenly revealed a bright smile.She returned the dagger to the Space Ring, and her entire body pounced on Ding Nanrong defenselessly.With one hand, she hugged Ding Nanrong softly.\u201cSister Rong! From now on, you are my good sister, hehehe.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ding Nanrong broke away from her embrace and indifferently said.\u201cI\u2019m going back to cultivate, make yourself comfortable.\u201d\u201cSister Rong wait!\u201dHan Yuqing called out to Ding Nanrong and asked with a smile.\u201cHave you suddenly acquired any spiritual arts like I have? You should look at mine first.\u201dWith that, she said, she cast Void Divine Concealment.The body then immediately became transparent and disappeared into the void, as if it didn\u2019t exist at all.Then lifted Void Divine Concealment and body reappeared again.\u201cHehehe, I call this \u2018Void Divine Concealment\u2019, it\u2019s not an ordinary invisibility technique, it\u2019s something that only the divine sense of the Demon God realm or Martial God realm can detect.\u201dHan Yuqing didn\u2019t shy away from telling Ding Nanrong about the effects of Void Divine Concealment.Ding Nanrong instantly understood what she meant.This Void Divine Concealment of hers was a spiritual technique that she had acquired after being revived by Jiang Mu and only God realm could sense it?No wonder she was undetected that night and had been successfully assassinated by her.Ding Nanrong nodded and said. \u201cWhat I gained is not a spiritual art, but an ability called \u2018Body \u2026.\u2019 , which is an ability that enables in Bounce Back Damage.\u201dShe was about to say \u2018Body of forced steel\u2019.But then suddenly didn\u2019t want to say it again, because it always felt like the word\u2026. wasn\u2019t very elegant and it didn\u2019t fit her figure.\u201cWhoa! Bounce back damage? How does it bounce back, how much does it bounce back?\u201dHan Yuqing was amazed. She had never heard that an ability that could bounce back damage existed in the world.\u201cBounce back 100% of the damage of an attack, the exact effect, you\u2019ll know if you slash me.\u201dDing Nanrong lifted her snow-white left arm.Indicating Han Yuqing to attack her in order to experience for herself how it was to be bounced back damage.\u201cGreat!\u201d Han Yuqing immediately took out the dagger from the Space Ring.She slashed at Ding Nanrong\u2019s arm without hesitationSlicee! Slicee!Surprisingly, two streams of fresh blood spilled out at the same time.One was from Ding Nanrong\u2019s left arm.The other, clearly from Han Yuqing\u2019s left arm.\u201cWow! So powerful!\u201dLooking at the bloody gash cut out of thin air on her left arm, Han Yuqing\u2019s eyes glowed.\u201cIt\u2019s actually the exact same wound!\u201d She saw that her left arm, and Ding Nanrong\u2019s left arm, had the same wound!What a new and exciting thing!\u201cAs you can see, as much damage as I take, the other person takes as much damage.\u201dSaid she and after taking a deep look at Han Yuzheng, Ding Nanrong turned and left.Soon there was no trace of her.\u201cHeh, that look she gave at the end, was it a hint that I shouldn\u2019t think about stabbing her, right?\u201dHan Yuqing gave a wry laugh. \u201cOhh, I don\u2019t want to kill you at all, my good sister Rong\u2019er.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, we two sisters, we have to serve our husband well.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the Wuyou Sect~\u201dShe was in a good mood, with her hands behind her back, humming a little tune.She walked in the direction of the Wuyou Sect with a happy smile.***Southern Border Demon Region.The headquarters of the Shahe Demon Army.Inside the big hall with white bones.\u201cLord Commander! You must take revenge for me!\u201dSha Wuwen, who had only one head left, complained in tears.Standing on a high step, Shahe looked at the head floating below and asked gruffly.\u201cYou are a cultivator of the Transformation Realm, and you were actually defeated by a human cultivator of the Gathering Spirit Realm, even losing your body?\u201dSha Wuwen instantly said back with a grimace.\u201cLord Commander! That human brat called ling Aotian, although he only has a cultivation level of the Spirit Gathering Realm, I didn\u2019t know what secret technique he used and actually forced his cultivation level to the Returning Element Realm!\u201cNot only that, that ling Aotian, he can also use Black Water Poison!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the poison of the Black Water Snake Clan!\u201dThe Black Water Snake Clan?Shahe\u2019s black, slithery eyes instantly widened.Boom!!!A powerful spiritual pressure intermingled with demonic power unconsciously exploded from his body.\u201cLord Commander \u2026.\u201dSha Wuwen, whose life was already hanging by a thread, suddenly, by Shahe\u2019s powerful spiritual pressure, he was crushed to the ground and almost died on the spot.Realizing that he had lost his temper, Shahe withdrew his spiritual pressure and urgently asked.\u201cYou just said about the Black Water Snake Clan, do you have any proof?\u201dSha Wuwen floated up again with difficulty, and took a breather before saying resentfully.\u201cThere is! My body was destroyed by ling Aotian\u2019s \u2018Snake God Poisonous Water Fist\u2019 move!\u201cBy the way, our stronghold \u2026. was also blown, so behind this brat, there must be a master of the Void Refining Realm!\u201dHe hadn\u2019t forgotten about the stronghold being blown into a hundred-meter deep sinkhole.That was something that could only be done by at least a cultivator of the Void Refining Realm or higher.Not even an ordinary Void Refining Realm!Just like this Lord Commander in front of him!\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d Shahe nodded his head, indicating that he understood.Sha Wuwen grimaced again and roared out.\u201cLord Commander! Please make sure you chop that brat called ling Aotian into pieces! In order to protect the majesty of my Spirit Devouring Sand Worm Clan!\u201d\u201cThis matter, this Commander will take note of it.\u201dShahe returned indifferently, and suddenly asked in a sharp tone. \u201cHave you forgotten one thing?\u201d\u201cWh\u2026 What is it?\u201dSha Wuwen froze, unsure, there was also an inexplicable feeling of apprehension.Shahe stared at him coldly and spat out three words heavily.\u201cThe Black Box!\u201d\u201cBox\u2026 The Black Box?\u201dOnly then did Sha Wuwen suddenly realize that in his desperation to escape, he had left behind that black Box!Inside the box was a large amount of information about the human cultivators in Lizhou state.For example, the number of sects, the number of cultivators in each realm, the types of spiritual arts, the types of weapons, the types of formations, pills, talismans, etc.This is an extremely important reference base for the future strategy of attacking the Lizhou State!Sha Wuwen\u2019s face turned pale as he said in a trembling voice.\u201cI \u2026. I accidentally left behind \u2026.\u201d\u201cIdiottt!!!\u201d Shahe violently grabbed the void in anger.The head of Sha Wuwen was instantly distorted and shaped by the pressure of space.Even the five senses were twisted and stacked in one piece.In the end, he couldn\u2019t even make a sound and was directly crushed into pieces of flesh.All the pieces of flesh fell off and in the end, only the egg-shaped, dark red demon core was left behind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There is another one!\u201d\u201cThe Black Water Snake Clan Chief, Black Water Fury!\u201dThinking of this, Shahe\u2019s heart rejoiced.He remembered, back then, during the siege of the Black Water Snake Clan.Black Water Snake Clan\u2019s Clan Chief, Black Water Fury, had disappeared with her soul.\u201cBlack Water Fury\u2019s cultivation realm is the real deal, Demon God realm!\u201d\u201cAlthough she is only in a soul state and has no physical body, her true strength is far less than before.\u201d\u201cBut it is still manageable to exert the strength of the Void Refining Realm.\u201d\u201cSuppose it really is her, then as long as her soul is devoured, this Commander will definitely be able to break through to the Void Realm!\u201d\u201cHa! Ha! Ha! Ha!\u201d Shahe laughed wildly.It was as if he saw a picture of himself breaking through to the Void Realm and ruling the world in the future.He even saw a picture of himself replacing the Desolate Lord!He immediately turned around and entered the secret room.In the center of the chamber stood a huge pitch-black stone tablet.He took out several crystals from his ring and placed them in the recesses of the tablet.Squeezing his hand in a seal, he recited.\u201cSpiritual Spirit Art!\u201dImmediately, the stone tablet emitted a soft light.A few moments later.On the stone tablet, a woman\u2019s figure hazily appeared.Although it was impossible to see her real face, but judging from her figure, which was shapely, she must be a beauty.Shahe opened his mouth and stated his intentions.\u201cLihua, go to the southern border of lizhou and help this commander investigate a person who should be in Xue City.\u201dWithin the image of the stone tablet, the enchanting voice of the lihua was heard.\u201cInvestigate who.\u201d\u201cA human brat named ling Aotian.\u201d\u201cLing Aotian?\u201dLihua seemed to feel a pang of surprise.This made Shahe feel strange.\u201cWhat, you know him?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never heard of him, what do you want to investigate about him?\u201d\u201cAll the information!\u201d\u201cAll information? What\u2019s so special about this ling Aotian that he\u2019s actually deeply favoured by you, Commander Shahe.\u201dThe lihua expressed confusion.Shahe narrowed those dark, protruding eyes and said.\u201cHe destroyed the stronghold I had set up in the Demon Beast Mountain Range, killed my trusted confidant Sha Wuwen, and took away the Black Box!\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d Lihua understood the situation.Then asked, \u201cWhat about the payment?\u201dShahe directly offered, \u201c50 Enlightened Realm demon cores.\u201dLinhua shook her head, \u201cToo little, I can\u2019t even earn back the travel expenses if I rush from the Changyu Empire to liuzhou.\u201dShahe thought so and increased the price, \u201c100 Enlightened Realm Demon Cores.\u201dLihua shook her head, \u201cToo little, I still have to rush back to the Changyu Empire from lizhou, I can\u2019t even make a return trip.\u201dAfter a pause, Shahe simply added a big price at once: \u201c150 Enlightened Realm Demon Cores, plus 5 Tongzhi Realm Demon Cores!\u201dLihua still shook her head, \u201cYou know, once ling Aotian finds out that I am a demon, then all the lihua pavilions that I have set up within Kyushu continent may suffer.\u201dShahe\u2019s tone grew cold: \u201c200 Enlightened Realm demon cores! Plus 10 Tongzhi realm demon cores!\u201dHe was very unhappy with this repeated demand from Lihua.But there was no way.Being able to seamlessly blend in with the human race without being easily discovered as a demon.Only she, the White Fox Clan, could do that.However, Lihua still shook her head, \u201cAs you know, my white fox clan\u2019s spirit arts are extremely soul-consuming, and in case of a battle happens, damage is inevitable.\u201dShahe held back his anger and his tone grew a few more degrees colder: \u201cHow much exactly, just name a price!\u201dLihua said her ideal price: \u201c250 demon cores of the Enlightened Realm, plus 15 demon cores of the Tongzhi Realm, and 2 demon cores of the Transformation Realm.\u201dShahe couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and was furious, \u201cHow dare you try to fool me! For only investigation of mere a Gathering Spirit realm brat, how can it be worth 2 Demon Cores of the Formation realm? Do you think I\u2019m a fool?\u201dLihua covered her face and cried, not knowing whether she was really aggrieved or not, \u201cI am also in a difficult situation, three years ago, you suddenly attacked the southern border of lizhou, causing the entire Kyushu continent to start strictly investigating the demon race, especially the southern border of lizhou, the investigation of the demon race is even more severe, I was forced to flee from there, I have recently considered whether to turn the lihua Pavilion in Xue City into a slaughterhouse. \u201d\u201cYou!!!\u201dShahe was enraged.Because what Lihua said made perfect sense, and he was unable to refute it.But in case ling Aotian\u2019s master. If that was really the Black Water Fury.Then it would be well worth the cost!So he sneered, \u201cFine! But I will add one more condition, when the time comes, I may need you to lure ling Aotian to a designated location.\u201dLihua smiled, \u201cNo problem, a pleasure to work with.\u201dShahe snorted coldly and closed the stone tablet screen.Looking at the pitch-black reflective stone tablet.Lihua revealed a satisfied smile.\u201cWhat a moron, with the brute strength of the Void Refining Realm but a mind filled with sand, no wonder he was defeated in the battle of the Demon Beast Mountain Range three years ago.\u201d\u201cThe Spirit Devouring Sand Worm Race?\u201d\u201cWhat a bunch of silly insects.\u201dMockingly, she ridiculed him.Lihua\u2019s thoughts spun and summoned out (Jiang Mu\u2019s private diary)\u201cShahe spent a lot of money to ask me to investigate ling Aotian.\u201d\u201cIn reality, it was to investigate the Black Water Fury, right?\u201dShe traced the contents of the diary about Black Water Fury with a light stroke of her jade hand, and found.[Tsk, speaking of Ling Aotian\u2019s master, she has long, black hair, straight little loli.][Although she is a Little loli, she has a dominant name.

Her full name is Black Water Fury, and she is the clan leader of the Black Water Snake Clan.][Oh yeah, she\u2019s also the third female lead.]\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that the Black Water Fury, who the Spirit Devouring Sand Worm Clan has been after, was actually ling Aotian\u2019s master and also third heroine \u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat about me, am I the main character heroine or the supporting female character? or maybe the same villain as Jiang Mu?\u201dLihua flashed a flirtatious smile.\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to where my fate leads and gotta meet soon this guy, Jiang Mu, sometime.\u201d\u201cOh yeah, in a few days, He\u2019s going to get married to Han Yuqing, alright then let\u2019s drop by his wedding banquet.\u201dClosing the diary, Lihua beckoned a maid and ordered.\u201cPrepare the lightning boat, I\u2019m going to make a trip to the southern border of lizhou.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d***Demonic Beast Mountain Range.Inside Jiang Mu\u2019s private Thunderlight Boat.\u201cWhat are you doing in my bed.\u201dAs soon as Ding Nanrong returned to her room.She saw Jiang Mu on his back, lying on her bed with his arms and legs spread out.\u201cGet up, do you want to die.\u201dDing Nanrong coldly looked down. Jiang Mu, however, did not react.Originally, he was going to wait for Ding Nanrong\u2019s room and ask her what was going on when she returned.But due to using the \u201cCelestial One Eye\u2019 for an hour and a half.It had led to increasing mental exhaustion.As a result, while waiting, he couldn\u2019t bear the drowsiness and fell asleep.Just see him turn on his side and his arms and legs clamped up to the fragrant quilt.To try to sleep more comfortably.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDing Nanrong\u2019s eyebrows frowned slightly, just silently, looking at the sleeping Jiang Mu.Going by her earlier temperament, she would definitely throw Jiang Mu out.But now, she already knew the direction of her fate, knew that she would become Jiang Mu\u2019s daoist partner.So much so that she\u2026 Couldn\u2019t give rise to any thoughts of throwing him out.\u2018Will I fall in love with this guy in the future?\u2019Ding Nanrong asked herself in her mind.\u201cAt least for now, I don\u2019t have that \u2026. feeling of love.\u201d\u2018Let it be natural.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was just after dawn.Hundreds of cultivators were gathered on the deck of Xue Cheng\u2019s ship.They talked to each other in high spirits.\u201cThe hunting season is over! I miss the spring flowers!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve finally killed enough wolf demons to avenge my dead brother\u2019s death! Hahahahahaha!!!\u201d\u201cThis young master has killed 108 demon beasts! With immediate effect, the might of my Extreme Star Divine Sword Sect will resound throughout the Lizhou Prefecture!!!\u201d\u201cMy sword, the tomb of the demons! I have already killed 300 demons, the rise of the human race can be expected!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be rich next time!!!\u201d***\u201cQuiet!\u201dXue Yuanshan\u2019s loud voice reached everyone\u2019s ears.After everyone hushed up and quieted down.Xue Yuanshan worded some words to sum up the speech for this hunting season.\u201cThis season has been the best one I have ever seen for you all.\u201d\u201cYou have experienced the ferocity and cunning of demon beasts.\u201d\u201cYou have understood the importance of unity against the demons.\u201d\u201cYou have learnt the truth that money and wealth are external to you, but fame and fortune are spent in the mirror.\u201d\u201cHunting demonic beasts is supposed to be a matter of both opportunity and risk.\u201d\u201cSome people gain and some lose, no more than that.\u201d\u201cBut no matter what, by killing demonic beasts, you are all contributing to Xue City, the Southern Realm, Lizhou, and even the entire Kyushu Continent!\u201dFinished a long speech.\u201cAlright, this hunting season, it\u2019s officially over, let\u2019s all disperse, we\u2019re ready to take off.\u201d\u201cOh wait, before we return to Xue City, this City Lord has one more person to reward heavily!\u201dXue Yuanshan turned his head and looked at Ling Aotian with a smile.Ling Aotian nodded his head in agreement.He stepped out with his head held high and stood level with Xue Yuanshan, facing the hundreds of cultivators directly.Although among these hundreds of cultivators, there were many cultivation levels higher than his.However, Ling Aotian was not at all timid. Instead, he even looked slightly arrogant.When Xue Yuanshan saw this, he secretly nodded his head: this son seemed to be more confident after five days of hunting, not bad.Then to the group of cultivators, he said.\u201cAs I said before, there is a demon army stronghold hidden inside the Demon Beast Mountain Range with unknown intentions, if any of you can uncover it, the City Lord\u2019s Palace will have a heavy reward.\u201dHe glanced at Ling Aotian and said appreciatively.\u201cAnd this Young Master Ling Aotian, he managed to uncover the stronghold of the Shahe Demon Army with just his own strength!\u201cAt the Gathering Spirit realm, he didn\u2019t just kill several Enlightening Realms demons\u201d.\u201cHe even dared to face the Transformation Realm\u2019s Sha Wuwen head-on, undaunted by life and death, such a feat by Young Master Ling deserves the admiration of us all!\u201d\u201cHe, is the pride of our Xue City!\u201dOooowww\u2026!After Xue Yuanshan finished speaking, everyone erupted.Their gazes were like magnetic iron, instantly sucked onto Ling Aotian\u2019s body.\u201cThis child has actually found out the stronghold of the Shahe Demon Army?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s something that even the people from the Dark Night Tower failed to uncover!!!\u201d\u201cAt the Gathering Spirit realm, he actually killed several Enlightened Realm sand bugs?!\u201d\u201cHe even dared to face a Demon Cultivator of the Transformation Realm straight on!!!\u201d\u201cSo powerful!!!\u201d\u201cSo strong!!!\u201d\u201cI want to marry him!!!\u201d\u201cI want his child!!!\u201d\u201cI will marry him even if I don\u2019t change my sex!!!\u201dListening to the crowd of cultivators\u2019 astonished admiration.The corners of Ling Aotian\u2019s mouth turned up, revealing a delightful evil smile.He couldn\u2019t help but look back at Xue Menghan, wanting to share his pleasure with her.However, Xue Menghan did not even spare him a glance. Instead, her arms were tracing through the air.Also pouting in her little mouth, she muttered.\u201cThat bastard Jiang Mu, why hasn\u2019t he updated yet, is he sleeping, hmph.\u201dThe expression looked as if it was dissatisfied.Was it because someone said they wanted to marry me, so Menghan felt dissatisfied?Ling Aotian shook his head and laughed.He didn\u2019t think that this was very likely. After all, it was still early for the two of them to get into a relationship.More likely, it was because the hunting season was over and she hadn\u2019t had enough fun yet, so she was feeling discontent.After all, she was so delicate and innocent, lively and playful.\u201cSince it was Young Master Ling Aotian who found the demon stronghold, then, this City Lord will keep his promise and give a heavy reward to Young Master Ling!\u201dXue Yuanshan took out a token from his Space ring.The front side of the token was white, engraved with the design of a box.The reverse side was black, with the design of an ancient building engraved on it.Someone recognized this token and exclaimed out of breath.\u201cIt\u2019s the Dark Night Building\u2019s Order of the \u2018Sound of the Day and Sun\u2019!\u201d\u201cThe Sound of Day and Sun token?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of token is that?\u201d\u201c\u2014.\u201dThere was a lot of chatter among the crowd.Xue Yuanshan coughed lightly and explained. \u201cThe Order of the Sound of Day and Sun is a special token made by the Dark Night House.\u201d\u201cThose who hold the token will not only enjoy all kinds of preferential treatment from the Dark Night House.\u201d\u201cMost importantly, they can also participate in the ruins exploration held by the Dark Night House!\u201dXue Yuanshan smiled as he handed the token to Ling Aotian.\u201cYoung Master Ling, congratulations, you have gained the qualification to enter the Voice of the Day Sun in three days\u2019 time.\u201d\u201cThank you, Lord City Master!\u201dLing Aotian gladly accepted the token.He had heard about it from Juan\u2019er before.The Voice of the Day Sun was a ruin.The teleportation door of this ruin could only be opened by the Dark Night House.The treasures inside the ruins were innumerable.As long as you find it, it belongs to you!Ling Aotian was delighted. I never thought that participating in such a hunting season would be worthwhile.Apart from helping his master recover some strength, taking a small revenge for the destruction of his village, being regarded and invested in by Han Yuqing, touching the threshold of the Qi Sea realm\u2026 And so on.Surprisingly, he had also obtained the qualification to participate in the ruins!Leaving aside the treasures inside the ruins, he definitely had the confidence to break through to the Qi Sea realm in the ruins!Because of his excellent performance, the Dark Night House Master, one of the three beauties of Xue City, Lu Chorou may even favor him.The more Ling Aotian thought about it, the happier he became, and his eyes seemed to glow.He would share this happiness with Xue Menghan!\u201cMenghan! Today I\u2019m high\u2026\u201d\u201cFinallyyy!\u201dXue Menghan suddenly shouted with joy.She saw that the diary had finally being updated.Ling Aotian, however, thought that Xue Menghan was overjoyed with his achievements.So he couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud:.\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dHe handed the token to Xue Menghan and proudly said.\u201cLook, Menghan! This is\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going back to my room first!\u201dXue Menghan did not want to read the diary in front of so many people.So she hurriedly dropped the sentence.She ran back to her room like a gust of wind.This caused Ling Aotian\u2019s hand holding the token to freeze in the wind.His face was half proud and half embarrassed.Bang!After Xue Menghan closed the door.Sitting right in front of the table, she read the diary.[March 12, sunny and cloudy.][Not normal, not normal.][Ding Nanrong is acting very strange. I accidentally fell asleep in her bed and slept all day and night.][She didn\u2019t throw me out?, I remember once in the past, I accidentally fell asleep in her bed, only to wake up and find myself falling off a cliff.]\u201cPfft! Falling off a cliff ahahahahahahaha!

Never mind.][Anyway, this old virgin, her persona has been skewed since she changed her look.]High above the clouds.A small private ship was flying at high speed towards the direction of the Wuyou Sect.Inside the room, Jiang Mu was sitting in front of the table writing in his diary.[Today\u2019s episode is kind of a transitional one.][It\u2019s mainly about wrapping up the hunting season, and laying out the next main storyline.][Xue Yuanshan will praise Ling Aotian in front of the crowd, boasting how awesome he is.][And then how the crowd was stunned and in awe.][And of course Xue Menghan, who would follow the stereotypical silly dog persona and show her standard maiden in love face to Ling Aotian.][From then on, the duo\u2019s relationship strengthened by another point.]\u201d Bah!

In your dreams!\u201dXue Menghan gritted her teeth angrily.If Jiang Mu was here, she would definitely give him a punch him through and through.[It\u2019s a pity that it\u2019s useless to strengthen feelings either.][Because this is the Qing Dynasty of the Harem, you can\u2019t even physically touch the hands.][This original author, is he trying to write a Platonic harem novel?][Whether it is or not, it will probably be a flop because she can\u2019t control the relationship thread.][So Xue Menghan, the number one female protagonist, keeps hovering around being a nymphomaniac][The relationship pace was slow as snails.][Later, there were readers who couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and directly started abusing the author, chapter by chapter, paragraph by paragraph, sentence by sentence, word by word, no matter the which platform. He was not spared.][The result of the continued abuses made the author\u2019s glass heart explode, and with a cry, he directly put an end to Xue Menghan.]\u201c????\u201d\u201cWhat happened to me?, you write it quickly!\u201dSeeing her ending, Xue Menghan\u2019s heart was intrigued and anxious.After a while, the diary content was only renewed.[Good news! Good news!][Just now Ding Nanrong came in.][She also brought a glass of milk and honey buns, saying that she made them herself and asked me to try them. I\u2019m so happy!]Ding Nanrong: \u201cWhat are you happy about? It\u2019s not the first time you\u2019ve eaten it.\u201dXue Menghan: This bastard likes milk and honey buns?[Why am I happy?][Because this old virgin actually got the plot right!][In the original plot, she just took the time to make me a milk and honey bun during the time she was sailing the airship!][Good Rong\u2019er, my dear Rong\u2019er, for once your persona was normal!

Inside the room on the seventh floor.\u201cIt\u2019s really my turn to make an appearance after the hunting season.\u201dLazily lying on her side on the couch, Lu Churuo elegantly flipped through her diary.[Hmmm \u2026. I\u2019ve already prepared my heart for this. Lu Churuo\u2019s persona will definitely be crooked.][After all, the female first and third, and the two female counterparts are all crooked.][Then this old witch probably will be no exception.]\u201cWhy would Jiang Mu call me an old witch?\u201d\u201cI am only two hundred and ninety years old, while the black water fury is nearly a thousand years old.\u201d\u201cTo say old, I\u2019m not as old as the Black Water Fury, am I?\u201dLu Chorou noticed a small detail.Jiang Mu seemed to have nicknames for them all.She, Lu Churou, The old witch.Xue Meng Han, Silly dog nymphomaniac.Black Water Fury, Dead bitch.Ding Nanrong, Old virgin.Han Yuqing, Pervert.[I just hope that when the time comes, this old witch won\u2019t be too outrageously crooked.][Well, that\u2019s pretty much it for today\u2019s main storyline.][When I get back to the Wuyou Sect, I\u2019m going to officially meet Han Yuqing, the pervert.][And tomorrow night, I\u2019m going to get married to her, and after that \u2026.][I\u2019ll write tomorrow\u2019s plot tomorrow.][I hope I have a good reward today!]Finished writing.

    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 - Noobchan Translation8-9 minutes\u00a002.06.2022\u201cThis transformation spell \u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s actually an immortal technique?\u201dJiang Mu froze for a moment, regarding immortal arts, he was naturally no stranger to them.It was a technique that could only be performed by immortals, and it was stronger than spirit arts.There were ostensibly six cultivation realms in this world.The highest was the Martial God realm.But in reality, There was also a seventh one above the Martial God realm: the Immortal realm.In this Harem of Martial Gods Record, there are two female protagonists who are in the Immortal Realm.But they both appeared at a later stage.\u201cThis Transformation Technique. It can transform a person into another person.\u201d\u201cThat is to say, I can transform myself or transform others.\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s try transforming myself and have a look.\u201d Jiang Mu was so interested he walked over to the one-person high standing mirror.Looking at himself in the mirror, he couldn\u2019t help but tsk.\u201cAs expected of the great villain.\u201d\u201cThis body, this face, this temperament, it all on other level, and I wonder what will happen to this body of mine when the temperament and face value have reached 100 points?\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t I be become ridiculously handsome lady killer?\u201d Jiang Mu tidied up his clothes a little.Then thought about who to transform into.\u201cLet\u2019s just turn into Ding Nanrong for first and see it\u2019s performance.\u201dSo in his mind, Ding Nanrong\u2019s appearance, body and clothes appeared.\u201cTransformation Technique!\u201dThere was a muffled sound of poof.The original handsome man in the mirror gone.It immediately turned into a cold beauty with a busty short dress, twin braids, and an arrogant curved figure.\u201cCrap it\u2019s heavy!\u201dJiang Mu suddenly felt his center of gravity rise, and with an unsteady stance, his whole body buckled on his knees in front of the mirror.\u201cGood Lord! Even these two \u2026. have changed out!\u201dJiang Mu looked into the mirror in amazement.\u201cSo, she\u2019s been carrying such heavy \u2026. weight, I guess it was hard for her as a child.\u201dJiang Mu stood up and took a few steps back and forth.It made him very uncomfortable.\u201cWell, not bad for an Immortal Technique.\u201d\u201cWait, If even the top has changed, then the bottom \u2026.\u201d\u201cHmmm \u2026As expected of immortal arts. It\u2019s lives upto the name\u2026.\u201d\u201cUndo!\u201d Jiang Mu lifted the transformation technique.The body immediately returned to its original state.\u201cTry changing into someone else.\u201d\u201cNow Han Yuqing.\u201dThen in his mind, Han Yuqing\u2019s appearance, body, and clothes appeared.\u201cTransformation Technique!\u201dThere was a muffled sound of poof.The original handsome man in the mirror.Has turned into a charming woman with a long lake blue dress and butterfly scars carved on her cheeks.Looking at the \u2018Han Yuqing\u2019 in the mirror.Jiang Mu couldn\u2019t help but have a sudden thought.\u201cThis transformation technique is something that can turn a person, into another person.\u201d\u201cThen \u2026. If I turn Han Yuqing, into Ding Nanrong, or into Xue Menghan, Lu Chorou, Black Water fury, Qu Nishang, Lihua, Bai, Qingyue Fairy \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThen following Han Yuqing\u2019s perverted persona, she seduces me like crazy \u2026.\u201d\u201chehe! This Transformation Technique is crazy!\u201dJust thinking about all those images of female protagonists seducing him the villain.An inexplicable \u2026. feeling rose up at the bottom of Jiang Mu\u2019s heart A sense of evil?Shaking his head off. \u201cThis dog system, rewarding me with a transformation technique that doesn\u2019t have much use.\u201d\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be that it\u2019s trying to make me fall for Han Yuqing and become distracted with passing the level, right?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s really the case.\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s too much of a despicable thing .\u201d***An hour later.The private Thunderlight ship arrived at the plaza of the Wuyou Sect.Jiang Mu had only just landed the ship.The hundreds of disciples standing in two rows on the square immediately shouted in unison.\u201cWelcome back Sect Master!!!\u201dThe sound resounded throughout the entire Wuyou Mountain.\u201cWoahh! What the hell.\u201dJiang Mu was freaked out by such a warm welcome.At that moment.A gust of fragrant wind washed over Jiang Mu\u2019s side in surprise.\u201cHusband!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWell, come to think of it.Jiang Mu then remembered. In the original plot.When he first returned to the Sect at the end of the hunting season, the entire sect\u2019s discipline would greet him.And it was Han Yuqing who had specially arranged such a grand event.Han Yuqing knew his arrogant temperament well.So she deliberately arranged for the entire sect to greet him in a grand manner, to satisfy his vanity and sense of superiority.Thus making him feel good about himself.And yet. \u201cHusband what a clingy women! We haven\u2019t even been married yet! Get off me!\u201dAs per Jiang Mu\u2019s villainous persona, I hate her.So couldn\u2019t allow this.\u201cOkay~!\u201d Han Yuqing obediently and reluctantly left Jiang Mu\u2019s embrace.Like a dutiful wife, she also stood to the side, looking at Jiang Mu with her eyebrows arched in a smile.A happy look on her face.It made all the male disciples hearts skip a beat.\u201cMiss Han is so well-behaved! I love her so much!\u201d\u201cThe butterfly tattoo on her face is so pretty! I want to touch it!\u201d\u201cShe smiles so seductively! She\u2019s seducing my soul!\u201d\u201cIf I could marry her, I\u2019d be willing to lose 30 years of my life!\u201d\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t any woman treat me like this\u2026\u201d\u201cRong\u2019er, I don\u2019t want to walk anymore, take me to the main hall of the sect!\u201dJiang Mu didn\u2019t even glance at Han Yuqing and instructed Ding Nanrong.Ding Nanrong didn\u2019t make a sound and hugged him directly from behind.On the side, Han Yuqing, however, smiled brightly and said to Ding Nanrong.\u201cSister Rong, you must hold husband steady alright, if he falls, I will be very distressed.\u201dIn her tone, there was a strong concern that could not be hidden.This caused the crowd of male disciples to fall in love with her a few million more times.Sister Rong? the hell?! Jiang Mu almost fell over.Did he just hear it wrong, maybe? What did Han Yuqing call Ding Nanrong??Sister Rong!!!Over seventy reincarnations, Han Yuqing never once called lDing Nanrong sister\u2026. Even when Ding Nanrong became her own sister, she never called her sister Ding Nanrong.Even when Ding Nanrong became his Daoist partner, Han Yuqing only called her Rong\u2019er!And now? One was a prospective Patriarch\u2019s wife and the other was a servant girl.How could the Patriarch\u2019s wife call the maid her sister?That\u2019s outrageous! \u201cThat, Rong\u2019er, you and her\u2026 You know her well?\u201dJiang Mu couldn\u2019t help but ask Ding Nanrong.He also suddenly remembered.Earlier, he had used the Celestial One Eye to see Ding Nanrong carrying the Water Lotus Sword and standing opposite Han Yuqing with a frosty face.That look was as if she was about to kill Han Yuqing.How come now\u2026 It suddenly felt like the two of them had become sisters!The relationship between the two of them, they couldn\u2019t have gotten friendly at that time, right \u2026.\u201cMy relationship with her is, well, so-so.\u201dDing Nanrong faintly replied.Then, without waiting for Jiang Mu to say more, she picked him up and flew off in the direction of the main hall of the sect.Han Yuqing, who was on the ground, still didn\u2019t forget to shout to Jiang Mu, who was getting carried away.\u201cHusband! Can we have dinner together in the evening!\u201dJiang Mu\u2019s voice came from afar: \u201cEat a chicken\u2026.\u201dIt was too far away to be heard very clearly.But Han Yuqing showed a happy smile and shouted even louder.\u201cThen it\u2019s a deal oh! I\u2019ll meet you for dinner tonight, My dear husband!!!\u201dJiang Mu\u2019s voice came from far and loud: \u201cEat you **#*%\u2026@*&amp;amp;amp***!!! \u2026\u2026\u201dIt was too far away to be heard anymore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - Noobchan Translation8-10 minutes\u00a002.06.2022...\u2014 At the same time, a huge lightning boat landed outside the city gates of Xue City.After Ling Aotian landed on the ship, he did not immediately return to the City Master\u2019s residence.Instead, he followed his master Black Water Fury\u2019s instructions and arrived at the foot of a deserted mountain.\u201cMaster, there is no one here, you can come out now.\u201dLing Aotian said to his Space Ring.A cloud of black mist burst out of his Space Ring.It formed a little girl with golden pupils in a black dress and straight black hair.\u201cMaster, what are you coming out to do?\u201d Ling Aotian was puzzled by the sudden action of his master.\u201cThis god is going to take a break.\u201d Black Water Fury said with an expressionless face and walked in the direction of Wuyou Mountain.\u201cMaster, this is the human frontier, what if your demon identity is discovered..\u201d\u201cJust kill it.\u201d\u201cThen, Master.. When will you return?\u201dLing Aotian was a little worried.He was always uneasy in his heart when his master was not around.What if he met the \u2018Buyang Seven\u2019 or something in Xue City, he wouldn\u2019t be able to take revenge.\u201cCome back? Depends on my mood!\u201d The Black Water Fury\u2019s face was chilly as she said back grimly.Ever since she knew that she was going to end up sacrificing herself to make Ling Aotian a success.She had the urge to kill Bastard Ling Aotian many times and be done with it once and for all.But after two days of quiet consideration, she eventually gave up killing Ling Aotian for the time being.She decided to reach out to Jiang Mu first to see if she could turn her fate around in the background.If not, just kill Jiang Mu, the so-called reincarnator, as well.\u201cMaster! The direction you\u2019re going, is Wuyou Mountain, that\u2019s the territory of the Wuyou Sect..\u201d\u201cSo what if it is.\u201d The Black Water Fury did not want to say more, and a ripple began to rise around her.It looked like she was preparing to use a spatial spirit art to transport herself.Ling Aotian suddenly remembered something and hurriedly shouted.\u201cRight, Master! I\u2019m going to explore the ruin in three days, you must return in time..\u201d\u201cShut up, You dare order this god!\u201dThe Black Water Fury burst out with a fierce burst of spiritual pressure, crushing Ling Aotian to the point where he fell to his knees on the spot.\u201c.. Mast-Master.. Pfft!\u201dLing Aotian could not withstand the pressure and spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.He did not understand why his master was suddenly furious.\u201cThis God does not have to be told what to do by others!\u201dBlack Water Fury dropped a ruthless sentence and disappeared into thin air in place.\u201c\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat happened to the Master, she-..\u201d\u201cLast time in the cliff cave, she suddenly came out of nowhere and beat me up violently..\u201d\u201cAnd today, she abruptly used her spiritual pressure to crush me..\u201dLing Aotian felt inexplicably aggrieved and slightly offended.He knew that Black Water Fury was vicious, but all along, she hadn\u2019t been so ruthless that she would hurt him.Wasn\u2019t he her disciple?At that moment, up ahead, on the mountain path, came the sound of several men talking.\u201cLook, brothers, there\u2019s a lad kneeling down there?\u201d\u201cHa, did this boy know that I, \u2018Bujan\u2019, would be passing by, so he\u2019s kneeling here on purpose?\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s so handsome, I\u2019m jealous and pisses me of, I want to beat him up.\u201d\u201cEh? Does he look like a familiar guy, brothers?\u201d\u201cNow that you say, He does looks familiar.\u201d\u201cOh Yeah, I think we beat him up before and threw him into a den of demon pigs, what was his name again?\u201d\u201cI think his name was Ling something.\u201d.\u201cHmm?\u201dAt these words, Ling Aotian looked up consciously.Upon seeing seven people with oddly shaped heads, deformed bodies, varying in height, fatness and thinness.His heart thudded, It was them!The \u2018Buyang Seven\u2019!He had not forgotten the shame of being thrown into the pigsty by the \u2018Buyang Seven\u2019 in the Demon Beast Mountain Range at that time.He vowed, That one day, he will get his revenge back!Ling Aotian clenched his fist and secretly swore. In his dark and cold eyes shone.There was also a flash of an imperceptible chill.\u201cF*ck! A chill flickered in that brat\u2019s eyes, Laozi saw it!\u201d\u201cWhat?! He still dares to be hostile to the us brothers?!\u201d\u201cShit, beat up less huh!\u201d\u201cBeat him up!\u201d\u201cPick him up!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a wild boar\u2019s nest in the mountains!\u201dWoo woo la la la la!Seven unattractive men, angry and jealous, pounced on Ling Aotian.It was like hungry wolves pouncing on him.\u201cW-why are you doing this!\u201dLing Aotian\u2019s face was filled with horror.***Wuyou Sect. Inside the bedchamber of the Patriarch\u2019s Hall.\u201cTransform!\u201dWosh!Jiang Mu used his Transformation Technique and transformed himself into Ding Nanrong\u2019s appearance once again.Then he walked around the room, elegantly and skillfully.\u201cHmm, I\u2019m getting more and more skilled with this transformation technique.\u201dJiang Mu practiced his transformation technique in his bedroom for a while.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that I can only transform into someone I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\u201cI had planned to change into the number one beauty of the Cangling Realm.\u201dHe had wanted to see the so-called world\u2019s number one beauty, Bai Qixue, in which part of the world was she beautiful.It was regrettable to find out. He couldn\u2019t.This transformation technique could not be changed into someone he had not seen with his own eyes.Suddenly, ripple arose in the air.Then, a little loli with a black dress and long, straight black hair appeared in the room out of thin air.After landing on the ground, the little loli stood face to face with \u2018Ding Nanrong\u2019.Big eyes stared at little eyes.Steel plates like chest.\u201c??\u201dJiang Mu stared in bewilderment.\u201cHmm.. Why am I hallucinating in broad daylight, .\u201d\u201cCould it be that practicing the transformation technique has created hallucinations?\u201d He closed his eyes.More than seventy rounds of absolute experience told him.At this moment, the Black Water Fury was staying in Ling Aotian\u2019s Space Ring and Ling Aotian was in Xuecheng.Therefore, the Black Water Fury in front of him was definitely a fake, an illusion.Once he opened his eyes, there\u2019d be no Black Water fury. So he did, opened his eyes.Two eyes met, still staring at each other with wide eyes.\u201cI-It\u2019s just an illusion, calm down.\u201d So close your eyes again.Open your eyes again.\u201cAn Illusion.\u201dClose eyes again.Eyes open again.\u201cCrap you\u2019re real nigga!\u201dJiang Mu had just opened his eyes when he saw, to his horror, that the Black Water Fury had actually lunged at him.Thudd!He was pressed down on the floor by the Black Water Fury.His own body, imprisoned by her with a spatial spirit technique.\u201cW-what are you doing!\u201d Jiang Mu\u2019s scalp tingled and his face was full of disbelief.The Black Water Fury in front of him.. It was real!!!She had come to his bedroom to find him!!!Why? The Black Water Fury narrowed those golden pupils and laughed mischievously, saying.\u201cI was just looking for Jiang Mu to have a chat, but after seeing you, his personal servent.\u201d\u201cClever as this god is, a plan came to mind.\u201dLooking for me for a chat?Talk about nonsense!I don\u2019t know you well, waittt, what did she just say?Did she say Personal servant and have a plan?\u201cYou\u2019re looking for me.. What do you want with my patriarch? As well as what are you going to do to me?\u201dJiang Mu was now in Ding Nanrong\u2019s appearance, and even his voice was that of Ding Nanrong.So in time, he changed his tone and also wanted to know what this dead bitch was going to do to Ding Nanrong.\u201cDo do I want? You\u2019ll know soon enough.\u201d The Black Water Fury grinned sinisterly.She stretched out her delicate arm and clenched her five fingers into a fist.A dense soul power coalesced on the fist.\u201cBlack Water Soul Etching Technique!\u201dHiss hiss~The fist unexpectedly turned into the shape of a snake\u2019s head, but there were no eyes. Only a snake\u2019s mouth like an abyss.The eeriness on Black Water Fury\u2019s face intensified even more as she grinned and said.\u201cSince you are Jiang Mu\u2019s personal attendant.\u201cThen, as long as you are turned into a loyal servant of this god.\u201cThen you can keep an eye on Jiang Mu every day and report his every move to this god!\u201dCrap? She\u2019s going to spy on my every move?Why would she do that? Before Jiang Mu could have a reaction.\u201cBecome a loyal slave of this god!\u201dThe Black Water Fury shoved her snake-like fist, violently, into his mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This familiar sense of deja vu!Jiang Mu remembered that day, in the uninhabited canyon of the Demon Beast Mountain Range.He had almost been turned into a slave by the Black Water Fury!It was fortunate that he had the \u2018The Body That Bears All Poisons\u2019 to absorb and refine her Soul Eater\u2019s poison.Otherwise, he would have gone cold long ago.Jiang Mu hurriedly activated his Poison Explosion Pill to absorb these Soul Eroding Poisons.\u201cYou\u2019re the second person to make this god willingly lose decades of life while casting a forbidden technique.\u201dThe Black Water Fury stared at \u2018Ding Nanrong\u2019 with a smirk.\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know how that bastard Jiang Mu was able to resist the Black Water Soul Erosion Technique, but that doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d\u201cAs long as you, the personal attendant, become a slave of this god, the result will be similar.\u201d\u201cYour mission from now on is to spy on, protect, and seduce Jiang Mu day and night, so that he will turn into puppet whatever you say!\u201dSince it was impossible to turn Jiang Mu into a slave.Then it was possible to use his personal servant girl as a starting point.Then to have this maid, to extract the future information from him about the course of her own destiny.Then, she could then control her own destiny and change her miserable ending to Happy one!While thinking so, The Black Water Fury scanned the magnificent huge breast of \u2018Ding Nanrong\u2019 and could not help but lick her lips in awe.\u201cYou\u2019ve grown so big because of the water element poison, haven\u2019t you, that it\u2019s even bigger than your head.\u201d\u201cThose few pounds of charm, no man can resist at all.\u201d\u201cSo that son of a bitch will definitely fall and become a good-for-nothing who can\u2019t live with you.\u201dWith that, the long, forked tongue took a shot at that*.Hiss~ Crap!That felt.. But it was so f**king real!Jiang Mu was *surprisingly* shivered with pleasant and warm feelings.He almost moaned out.Black Water Fury brushed her long, straight black hair and smiled sweetly.\u201cDo you feel now, that your soul is starting to tremble with joy?\u201cDo you want to prostrate yourself on your knees and sing the praises of this God?\u201d\u201cDo you long to give your life for this God?\u201d\u201cCongratulations, you are about to become a loyal slave of this God.\u201d\u201cSoon, you will be united with Jiang Mu and become his daoist couple.\u201d\u201cAre you looking forward to it?\u201dLook forward to it, you faggot!Jiang Mu was irritated.He had probably guessed the root reason why the Black Water Fury was looking for him.It must be because of the incident where he had thrown her into the hundred-meter sinkhole.With her ruthless nature of holding grudges, she would definitely look for a chance to take revenge.This is why, she was now looking for him.She had also taken control of Ding Nanrong in the process, to make her seduce him and make him completely pleasurefal. So he will become a puppet who\u2019ll be controlled through Ding Nanrong..If this bitch gets upset, he might even be killed!Damn, this plot is still going nowhere, it\u2019s a complete mess!Is this what happens when you have a crooked persona?Shit system! Rubbish novel!Jiang Mu cursed, but no matter how crooked the plot and persona was.He had to get through this crisis first.Otherwise, he would really become this dead bitch\u2019s slave.That would be the end of him.So, Jiang Mu sucked up hard.At the same time, he accelerated the Poison Explosion Pill, desperately absorbing and refining the Soul Eroding Poison.I will suck you dry dead bitch!\u201cIt seems that you can\u2019t wait to become a slave of this god.\u201dFeeling \u2018Ding Nanrong\u2019s\u2019 active and responsive absorption, the Black Water Fury is satisfied.However, it didn\u2019t take long.She felt a violent dizziness in her head.How.. What\u2019s going on?My Soul Eater\u2019s poison.. Is it out of control?Her face suddenly changed.The Soul-Eating Poison that she had fed to \u2018Ding Nanrong\u2019 had exploded out of control!This feeling.. It was just like that time, exactly the same as the day Jiang Mu had sucked her dry!\u201cYou.. Let go of my hand!!!\u201dThe Black Water Fury had experienced this once, and made a decisive attempt to pull her arm out.But Jiang Mu was biting down so tightly that she couldn\u2019t pull it out.Let go my ass! I\u2019m not stupid!Watch me how I suck you to death!Jiang Mu feverishly absorbed it as if his life were dependent on it.\u201cHow could this god fall in the same shameful situation!\u201dBlack Water Fury\u2019s face was ruthless to the extreme.She stretched out her small hand in the shape of five fingers, wanting to strangle \u2018Ding Nanrong\u2019 by the neck.The Black Water Fury finally couldn\u2019t bear it anymore.Her five fingers suddenly rippled through space.It looked like she wanted to completely destroy him.Damn it, Jiang Mu was so frightened that he immediately lifted his Transformation Technique.Poof~~, he transformed back into his original form.Because he had transformed back to his original form, he was able to avoid Black Water Fury\u2019s fierce attack.The Black Water Fury\u2019s rippling five fingers grabbed the top of Jiang Mu\u2019s chest, creating a distorted vacuum.What a monster, that was close!\u201cYou..?\u201d Black Water Fury couldn\u2019t help but stare in disbelief after she successfully drew her arm out.What did she see just now?\u2018Ding Nanrong\u2019 had actually turned into Jiang Mu!\u201cYou\u2019re.. Jiang Mu?!!!\u201d She understood in an instant.It turned out that this \u2018Ding Nanrong\u2019, from beginning to end, was Jiang Mu\u2019s transformation.This transformation technique was actually so remarkable that even her divine sense couldn\u2019t detect it!Jiang Mu didn\u2019t care about her.Taking advantage of her weakened state, he got up with a snap, kicked his legs out, and ran for the door.As he ran, he called for help.\u201cRong\u2019er help me!!!\u201dHe had not yet reached the door of the room.Before he could reach the door, the Black Water Fury appeared in front of him in a flash despite her weakness and dizziness.Another hand slash knocked him out hard.THUD! With that sound. Jiang Mu fell straight to the ground.The Black Water Fury also sat down on the ground to adjust her breathing because of being weakened.Due to the large amount of soul power that had been sucked dry.So much so that it was difficult for her to recover for a while. To planned to recover little.But at that very moment.A Water Lotus Sword shot in through the door.It came straight towards her chest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - Noobchan Translation7-9 minutes\u00a002.06.2022...\u2014 The Black Water Fury\u2019s golden pupils shrank sharply.In front of her chest, a spatial barrier suddenly formed.The Water Lotus Sword pierced through the spatial barrier, the tip of the sword just barely resting on the heart of her chest. Stopped and was unable to advance a single inch.She took the opportunity to jump backwards and grabbed it with her five fingers.A click! There was a crunching sound.The Water Lotus Sword was crushed by the spatial barrier.\u201cWater Element \u2013 Great Water Dragon Technique!\u201dWith an indifferent female voice came a cold voice.An extremely thick water dragon penetrated the door and spiraled towards the Black Water Fury.The Black Water Fury intended to use the Spatial Spirit Art to escape.But due to the excessive loss of soul power, her body was so weak that she could not successfully perform it.The only way to escape was to take the door open.\u201cHow can a mere Return to Origin realm be worthy of blocking the way of this God?\u201dThe Black Water Fury\u2019s arm rippled, covering a spatial shield.She welcomed the dragon.The arm slashed sharply.Clatter!The great water dragon was directly slashed and burst.But instead of dissipating, the water dragon unexpectedly turned into a large amount of water.The water covered her body and drenched her black dress and black hair, and the tip of the small lotus was faintly attached.As she rushed out of the room, dripping wet.She saw Ding Nanrong stabbing her with her sword raised at breakneck speed.Black Water Fury blocked her with a thrusting her arm.The spatial shield on her arm, along the tip of the sword, crawled towards Ding Nanrong like maggots attached to her bones, instantly imprisoning Ding Nanrong temporarily.With a grim gaze, the Black Water Fury entangled a dark, black water snake in her other hand.\u201cSnake God Poisonous Water Fist!\u201d\u201cGo to hell!\u201dHer fist struck out fiercely at Ding Nanrong\u2019s abdomen.Because Ding Nanrong was at the Returned Origin Realm, the weakened woman did not dare to act boldly.The only way to ensure her safe escape was to kill her opponent.Ding Nanrong\u2019s abdomen was pierced on the spot, and the black water snake, instantly, sank into her body.\u201cGUhaa!\u201d Ding Nanrong spat blood and monaed in pain.\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201d The Black Water Fury also screamed miserably.The two of them unexpectedly both fell to their knees.Black Water Fury urgently drew out her fist and jumped back away from Ding Nanrong.She panicked and moved her spiritual power and soul power to quickly heal the hollow in her abdomen.At the same time, she looked at Ding Nanrong, her face pale and horrified:.\u201cYou.. How did you.. Counterattack this God?!\u201dShe didn\u2019t see at all how Ding Narong had injured her!Remembering that day in the Uninhabited Canyon, when she had punched Jiang Mu, she had inexplicably been struck back by him.Now this situation of Ding Nanrong was actually exactly the same as Jiang Mu\u2019s!Why?!The Black Water Fury was in a state of shock and disbelief.She didn\u2019t dare to rashly go and kill Ding Nanrong now.Ding Nanrong didn\u2019t reply.She was moving the water elemental power within her body to contain the deterioration of her wounds and suppress the spread of the Black Water Snake Poison.The Black Water Snake, on the other hand, took this opportunity to run decisively towards the outside of the sect master\u2019s hall.Then she fled in the direction of the cliff at the back of the mountain.She was already very weak, plus, she was now heavily injured.So she simply did not dare to stay for half a breath longer.If not, when another cultivator from the Returning Origin Realm, or even the Qi Sea Realm, came, she wasn\u2019t even ten percent sure of escaping!And just after that, Black Water Fury had fled.Han Yuqing happened to be carrying a plate of spirit fruits and walked over happily.\u201cSister Rong?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing sitting here?\u201d\u201cYah! Your stomach is pierced!\u201dHan Yuqing was taken aback.She had originally wanted to take the spirit fruit to Jiang Mu as a way to narrow the distance between the two of them, as she couldn\u2019t wait for dinner.But now, instead, she saw a seriously injured Ding Nanrong at the entrance to Jiang Mu\u2019s room!\u201cSister Rong, what\u2019s going on?!\u201d\u201cWho injured you?!\u201dHan Yuqing placed the spirit fruit on the floor and hurriedly tried to check her body.But Ding Nan Rong waved her hand to stop it, her breath weak as she said to her.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have a water element body and have a healing technique, this kind of injury can\u2019t kill me.\u201d\u201cAnyway, I was just returning from the back of the mountain.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s when suddenly I\u00a0 heard the patriarch\u2019s cry for help.\u201d\u201cWhen coming here, I saw a Golden Pupil Snake Demon.\u201d\u201cThat golden-pupil snake demon knocked out the Patriarch.\u201dHan Yuqing got extremely anxious.\u201cWhat?! Husband was knocked out?!\u201dShe wanted to go into the bedroom and check on Jiang Mu\u2019s condition.But she was pulled back by Ding Nanrong.\u201cThe patriarch is only unconscious, there\u2019s nothing serious wrong with him.\u201d\u201cWhat you need to do now is to hurry up and kill that Golden Pupil Snake Demon.\u201dSaid. As she with her finger, tapped on Han Yuqing\u2019s forehead and injected a water elemental force.\u201cSister Rong, this is..?\u201dHan Yuqing was amazed.When she moved this water elemental force, she could actually sense that there was a vague and indefinite aura in the direction of the back mountain that was moving further and further away.Ding Nanrong explained.\u201cThat Golden Pupil Demon Snake, whose strength is at the Void Refining Realm, seems to be only a few points stronger than me.\u201d\u201cShe was covered in water from my Great Water Dragon Technique, and as long as she\u2019s still wet, you\u2019ll be able to sense her.\u201dHearing this, Han Yuqing\u2019s face was grave.\u201cBut demon races are generally stronger than human races of the same realm, and I\u2019m only at the ninth level of the Qi Sea realm..\u201dDing Nanrong said.\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem.\u201d\u201cAs she struck through my abdomen, and was \u2018forced..\u2019 by my Counter Damage ability gave back damage.\u201d\u201cTherefore, she is now seriously injured.\u201d\u201cAs long as you use Void Divine Concealment, you\u2019ll have a chance to kill her.\u201dHan Yuqing\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cAlright!\u201d She stood up and took out a dagger.Looking in the direction of the back mountain, she revealed an eerie smile:.\u201cTo think that as a demon, she dares to barge into our Wuyou Sect and knock out my husband.\u201d\u201cI must kill her and use her snake flesh to boil hot and tonic husband\u2019s body.\u201d***A thousand miles away from the Wuyou Sect Mountain.In a damp and gloomy waterfall cave.In the form of a human snake, the Black Water Fury was weakly bent over on the ground, recuperating.\u201cThat son of a bitch!\u201d\u201cTwice in a row he has evaded the Black Water Soul Etching Technique and even absorbed this god\u2019s power in turn!\u201d\u201cIs this what they call a reincarnator?\u201cIt\u2019s as if it wasn\u2019t enough, that servant girl, Ding Nanrong, is actually just like that son of a bitch, able to use secret technique counterattack that this God cannot even detect!\u201d\u201cDamn it!!!\u201d She felt inexplicably humiliated.It had always been her who had oppressed others.I never thought that today, she would be screwed over so badly by a mere two humans.\u201cDing Nanrong is it!\u201d\u201cThis god will definitely call Ling Aotian and kill you brutally!\u201dSecretly, she swore a poisonous oath.She then fell into a deep sleep because she was too weak and exhausted, and finally could not resist her drowsiness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Come to think of it, I got knocked out by that dead bitch.\u201d\u201cBut where is she?\u201d Jiang Mu rubbed the back of his head and looked around the room.But there was no sign of the Black Water Fury.It looked like she had run away after knocking him out?He got out of bed and went to the table, pouring a glass of water to moisten his throat.And checked his dantian, due to absorbing a large amount of the Black Water Fury\u2019s soul-devouring poison.So within the Dantian, a poisonous explosive pill with a dazzling black aura had been generated.Estimating its power, it could probably poison and waste a cultivator of the Returned Origin realm.\u201cDamn, there\u2019s no use for me to want this shitty pill.\u201d\u201cThat dead bitch is already so crooked that she\u2019s hopeless.\u201d\u201cWith her ruthless character, she will never give up.\u201d\u201cThen how am I supposed to continue with the plot.\u201d\u201cFuck.\u201d Jiang Mu felt mentally exhausted.He wanted to go out and go to the cliffs at the back of the mountain to breathe the breeze and see the moon to relieve his mood.When the door to the room was opened.He saw two female disciples from the Qi Sea realm guarding the door.\u201cWhat are you guys doing guarding here?\u201d Jiang Mu felt curious.Normally, there was no need for someone to guard his bedroom.After all, there was Ding Nanrong living right next door, so safety wasn\u2019t a problem.Besides, cultivators who could successfully break into the Patriarch\u2019s Hall must all be in the Void Practitioner realm.Then it would be pointless to arrange for two Qi Hai Mirror disciples to keep watch.\u201cBack to the Patriarch.\u201d\u201cIt was Miss Rong who instructed us to keep watch here.\u201d\u201cShe said that when you wake up, go find her in her chambers.\u201d????This old virgin, would she actually take the initiative to ask me to go to her?That\u2019s strange.. What the hell.It must be because of the crooked persona.Jiang Mu remembered that the aloof Ding Nanrong never allowed him to enter her chambers before double cultivation.\u201cWell, you guys go down.\u201dHe waved his hand to indicate for them to leave.Then he went back to his own bedchamber and walked to the wall that separated him from Ding Nanrong\u2019s bedchamber.There was a door in the wall, which was convenient for Ding Narong to come over and protect him.Tuk Tuk Tuk!\u201cRong\u2019er, I\u2019m coming.\u201d\u201cCome in..\u201d A frail voice came from across the room, with a tone of urgency.What was wrong with her?Jiang Mu felt puzzled, so he pushed the door straight in.\u201cRong\u2019er, you\u2019re looking for me.. Damn it! What\u2019s wrong with you!\u201dHe had just entered through the door.He was horrified to see it.Ding Nanrong\u2019s face was bloodless, lying on her back on the ground!And her posture was freakishly weird.Above her waist, she was lying backwards on the ground.Below her waist, her legs were sitting, normally crossed and coiled on a futon.And at this moment, she was using her hands to support the ground, desperately trying to sit upright.Jiang Mu hurriedly ran over and helped her sit up behind her.However, after she sat upright, the upper half of her body went limp again and fell backwards into Jiang Mu\u2019s arms.\u201cRong\u2019er! What is this \u2026\u201d Jiang Mu\u2019s eyes widened.In this condition, it felt like she was.. Half-body paralysis??And Ding Nanrong\u2019s following words made his scalp tingle.\u201cMy abdomen.. It was pierced by a golden-pupil snake demon..\u201d\u201cThat golden-pupil snake demon.. It also injected a black water snake, into my body..\u201dA golden-pupil snake demon!Isn\u2019t that the Black Water Fury!That bitch injured my Ding Nanrong!And injected a black water snake poison, into her body?!SNAP!!!This was clearly an attempt to kill Ding Nan Rong!Jiang Mu felt his scalp tingle at the same time.He felt a surge of anger. Ding Nanrong had already died once.What if she died again? Then what was the point of going through the plot!\u201cRong\u2019er, how is your body feeling now?\u201dThe tone of voice was full of concern, though.But Jiang Mu wasn\u2019t very flustered.For one thing, Ding Nanrong was a water element body and could heal herself from her injuries, so getting stabbed through the stomach or something wouldn\u2019t kill her.Secondly, the black water snake poison in her body could definitely be absorbed by him.But where to suck it from?That had to be understood first to get a clear picture of her.\u201cPatriarch..\u201d\u201cBelow my waist..\u201d\u201chave lost all sensation..\u201d\u201cAnd beginning to show signs of atrophy..\u201dDing Nanrong\u2019s forehead was blue with tendons, and cold sweat was pouring out.She was desperately trying to use the power of the water element to restrain the expansion of the black water snake poison.However, as the injury to her abdomen needed to be healed, this took away the vast majority of her energy.As a result, the Black Water Snake Poison in her body could not be effectively stopped and was slowly spreading.With all her efforts, she was only able to stop the spread of the poison to the upper half of her body.The lower half of her body, now, was unable to move and had begun to shrivel up.\u201cI see!\u201d Jiang Mu understood in his heart.He couldn\u2019t help but recall the day Xue Menghan had been poisoned by the Blood Poison Tree Demon and had many bloody holes pierced out of her legs.And it was with his mouth that he had sucked those blood holes in Xue Menghan\u2019s legs.It was only in the end that all the toxins were absorbed out.Then. The same reasoning.He could also use his mouth and suck on the lower half of Ding Nanrong\u2019s.. Ugh, she didn\u2019t seem to have any blood holes.\u201cRong\u2019er, the hole in your stomach has been Healed?\u201d\u201cHealed..\u201dRight, so where do I go from here?Jiang Mu couldn\u2019t help but look at Ding Nanrong\u2019s pale lips.Ding Nanrong seemed to be prepared for this.She tore open the clothing on her abdomen and stabbed her navel with her finger.\u201cPatriarch..\u201d\u201cHow did you help Miss Xue get rid of the poison before..\u201d\u201cNow.. Just help me get rid of it however you can..\u201dIf she had said this before, her heart would have been unruffled when she said it.But now that she already knew that she would be Jiang Mu\u2019s daoist couple in the future, the two of them would be a pair..So much so that she was now actually a little.. Nervous?I don\u2019t think it was nervous..\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go to bed.\u201dJiang Mu nodded and picked her up by the waist.After laying her flat on the bed.He himself then took off his shoes and climbed on, bracing his hands on either side of her waist.Then his head bent down towards her stomach.But he felt something against the top of his head.It was not convenient to go down.\u201cThat, Rong\u2019er, hold it upwards?\u201d\u201c\u2014\u201dDing Nanrong\u2019s face was expressionless, and she used both hands to hold two big objects upwards high.Jiang Mu then bent her head down again.And puckered his lips, to that navel blood hole in the belly button, sucking it up.***The moon was clear and the stars were sparse.A thousand miles away from the Wuyou sect Mountain.In a damp and gloomy waterfall cave.The Black Water Fury, in the form of a human body and a snake, was coiled up in a snake\u2019s body, sleeping comfortably.Suddenly, her eyes were violently pierced and gouged out by some sharp object out of thin air.Golden flesh and white froth splashed and flew.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhh..!!!\u201dThe sleeping Black Water Fury let out a miserable wail on the spot.The wailing echoed throughout the waterfall cave.It lasted for a long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The dark, thick and long snake body flopping and tumbling on the ground in agony, crashing into cave rocks in shattering disarray.As she rolled in a tumble, with her belly facing upwards.\u201cHehe! Xuanguang extinguishing!\u201dA small, dazzling pillar of light shot down from the roof of the cave.On the spot, it shot Blackwater Fury\u2019s tough white belly, right through.\u201cAhhhh..!!!\u201dThe Black Water Fury screamed in agony as she was shot.She curled up her snake\u2019s body, forcing herself to endure the severe pain and releasing her divine senses.\u201cWho is it! Show yourself to this god.. Get the hell out!!!\u201dThe divine sense instantly covered the entire waterfall cave.The next moment.She sensed that there was a presence of someone in stealth hanging above her head.By looking at her spiritual aura, the person was in the Qi Sea realm.\u201cGet the hell down!!!\u201dWith a flick of the Black Water Fury\u2019s snake tail, the entire person sprang up in place.????Can she actually sense me? Han Yuqing\u2019s face paled in stealth.Her Void Divine Concealment was something that could not be sensed at all by anyone, except by divine sense.Could it be that this snake demon, possessed a divine sense or some special perception ability?It was too late to think anymore.Han Yuqing jumped away from her original position, easily avoiding the impact of the Black Water Demon.After the two of them both landed on the ground.Han Yuqing immediately released her stealth state to conserve her spiritual energy.Looking ahead at the Black Water Fury, who was blinded and had a hole in her stomach, Han Yuqing let out a wry smile.\u201cHehe, Sister Rong said that you, at the Void Practitioner realm, were already seriously injured.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that you were actually weakened to this extent.\u201d\u201cAs a demon race, you didn\u2019t want to stay in the demon domain peacefully.\u201d\u201cInstead, you sneaked into our Wuyou Sect and knocked my husband unconscious.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you now and take you to make a snake soup with your head!\u201dHan Yuqing held a dagger in her hand as she mocked and moved towards the Black Water Fury.\u201cA mere ninth level of Qi Sea Mirror, how dare you speak arrogantly in front of this god!\u201dThe Black Water Fury leaned down and covered the ground with her palms, and with a stern look on her face, she consumed a large amount of spiritual energy and black water snake poison in order to perform the following secret technique.\u201cBlack Death Pool!\u201dA crash!The firm ground in front of her instantly turned into a pool of churning black water.And one of Han Yuqing\u2019s feet happened to land on the surface of the water.And Han Yuqing\u2019s body was instantly pulled in, and her body could no longer move forward.\u201cWhat is this?!\u201dShe was shocked to find that not only was she unable to move forward.Those legs that were submerged in the black water were also gradually becoming paralyzed, and her entire body was even slowly sinking downwards.No matter how hard she struggled, it was futile!\u201cDon\u2019t bother to struggle!\u201dThe Black Water Fury\u2019s face was rampant, and the long, forked tongue licked her lips.\u201cThe Black Death Pool, possesses the ability to stick and hold.\u201d\u201cThe black water snake poison inside will even erode your legs and spread upwards to your entire body.\u201d\u201cWhen your entire body is completely submerged in the pool, you will turn into a withered bone and die!\u201d\u201cHahahahahaha!\u201dWhile laughing maniacally, she did not forget to raise her spiritual power and soul power in order to heal the blood hole in her abdomen.\u201cXuantian Liuyang Slash!\u201dHan Yuqing took advantage of her moment of healing to resolutely swing her dagger horizontally.A stream of light as strong as the sun shot out from the dagger and sliced horizontally towards Black Water Fury\u2019s snake body.She purposely deflected the stream of light slightly upwards, forcing the Black Water Fury to dodge low.And so it did. The Black Water Fury subconsciously lowered her head and easily dodged the stream of light.\u201cHehehe!\u201dHan Yuqing let out a sly laugh as if she had succeeded.\u201cXuanyang Radiant Dao Light!!!\u201dHer body suddenly emitted a dazzling light, the long lake blue dress on her body bursting apart in an instant as her entire body transformed into a blinding white light like the blazing sun.\u201cGo to hell!!!\u201dHan Yuqing, who had transformed into light, and light shot directly at the Black Water Fury\u2019s head.Slice!!!The Black Water Fury\u2019s head was cut in half at the same time.She stared blankly with her hollow eyes, her face full of horror.This.. Spirit of \u2026Demon God.. ..how..Thud!The Black Water Fury, with a half human body and a snake tail, slumped to the ground.After twitching twice, it no longer moved.Han Yuqing, who was all naked now, and was unable to walk normally because her legs had been eroded by the Black Water Snake poison.She moved with a limp to the Black Water Fury corpse.Then, folding her palms, she aimed them at Blackwater Fury\u2019s back, where the heart was.\u201cXuanguang extinguishing!\u201dA small, dazzling pillar of light shot out from the palms of her hands.It directly shot Black Water Fury\u2019s heart right through.To be on the conservative side.She used her dagger again and slashed at Black Water Fury\u2019s neck, cutting off her head.As the head and body separated.The Black Water Fury\u2019s body shrunk back into a small, ordinary, non-poisonous water snake.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing the mending knife made you turn back into a snake.\u201d\u201cIf not, I would have had to make soup out of you like this.\u201dHan Yuqing threw the half of the snake\u2019s head and body, together into the space ring.Then she took out a long lake blue dress and hurriedly put it on herself.\u201cI must return to the Sect as soon as possible to get rid of the black water snake poison inside my legs.\u201d\u201cOtherwise, my legs..\u201dHan Yuqing shook his legs with a grave expression.It was discovered that in addition to paralysis, there were also vague signs of atrophy.She knew for herself that time was precious.Then, limping, she walked back in the direction of the Wuyou Sect.***Early morning, next day.Inside Ding Nanrong\u2019s room.Jiang Mu, who was asleep, was awakened by something soft and had a nice fragrance.He moved his head away and opened his eyes in a daze.He saw a sleeping Ding Nanrong, lying beside him.\u201cMmm., It seems that I was too tired last night and accidentally fell asleep in her bed.\u201dLast night, he helped Ding Nanrong absorb the Black Water Snake poison.After absorbing it, he fell asleep straight away because he was too exhausted.\u201cBut her sleeping face, it\u2019s really elegant and endlessly beautiful.\u201dJiang Mu admired the wavy beauty on the bed for a while beforeOnly then did he get up and stretch out.\u201cDamn it, I don\u2019t know when that dead bitch, will come back.\u201dThinking about Black Water Fury gave Jiang Mu a headache.\u201cLet\u2019s ignore it for now.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want ruin my whole day thinking about her in the morning.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s just get today\u2019s reward in hand before thinking about anything else.\u201dSo he walked over to the table and sat down.Summoning the diary, start writing today\u2019s diary.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It pisses me off]Jiang Mu rubbed his temple, thought about what contents to write.\u201cToday, what\u2019s the main storyline coming up?\u201d\u201cBesides the fact that Lihua came to Xue City to investigate Ling Aotian.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s also the fact that I\u2019m getting married to Han Yuqing tonight.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s start by writing about the Lihua.\u201dSo the book continued to be written.[That Lihua, she\u2019s coming to Xue City today.][She is also the head of the Lihua Pavilion, and among the three great beauties of Xue City.][This demon, or rather the fourth female lead.]High above the clouds.A private lightning ship with the appearance of a white fox was flying at high speed towards the southern direction.Inside the smoky room, an enchanting woman, clad in a white brocade jacket, folded her legs and sat against the soft bed.\u201cI see, I\u2019m the fourth female master.\u201dLihua\u2019s pair of demonic Phoenix eyes stared with interest at the \u201cJiang Mu\u2019s Private Diary\u201d in her hand.[This demon has traveled a long way from the Changyu Empire, to Xue City, with the aim of investigating Ling Aotian][When she arrives in Xue City this evening, she will send someone to invite Ling Aotian to her Lihua Pavilion for their first meeting.][As a result, Ling Aotian\u2019s protagonist\u2019s characteristic of seeing one and falling in love with another came into effect.][When he saw this demon, he was instantly attracted to her seductive charm and fell in love with her, the same kind of love at first sight as when he met Xue Menghan and Lu Churou.][Don\u2019t want to spout off. But it just straight-up f**ked to see someone falling in love at first sight at every damn turn. He\u2019s worse than a monkey in heat.][Then the Lihua used Ling Ao Tian\u2019s fondness for herself to keep him in the loop and slowly extract information later.]\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019ve basically been informed about Ling Aotian in my (Your) diary.\u201d\u201cIn his ring, isn\u2019t it the Black Water Fury residing the Demon God.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t she the Black Water Fury also the leader of the Black Water Snake Clan, and the one Shahe is looking for?\u201d\u201cThen there\u2019s nothing to investigate now, is there.\u201d Lihua blinked.The reason she had come to Xue City.For one, it was for Shahe\u2019s sake.Secondly, she was actually interested in Jiang Mu.So, by the way, she came to Xuecheng, as she was told anyway.\u201cCome here.\u201d Lihua called for her maid and instructed her.\u201cWhen you arrive at the Southern in the State of Li, don\u2019t go back to Xue City, instead head straight to the Wuyou Sect.\u201dJiang Mu finished writing about Lihua.Then he went on to write about himself.[Tonight, I\u2019m getting married to Han Yuqing]\u201cThat bastard.. Is getting married..\u201dXue Menghan was in the courtyard, holding her diary.I don\u2019t know why, but upon knowing that Jiang Mu was going to get married.She felt a bit lost in her heart.[Although it\u2019s a marriage.][But according to the villain\u2019s persona, I don\u2019t like Han Yuqing\u2019s. It\u2019s Xue Menghan I like.]\u201cHe.. Likes me.\u201d Xue Menghan\u2019s heart skipped slightly.Previously at her own sixteenth birthday banquet, though, Jiang Mu had said that he liked her, but she didn\u2019t take it to heart at all then.Yet now, looking at the words \u2018It\u2019s Xue Menghan I like\u2019.The sense of loss she felt just then somehow actually dissipated.She was even a little.. Happy?\u201cBlah blah blah, I don\u2019t care about being liked by you!\u201dXue Menghan fiercely shook her head.Then, seriously, she continued to read.[And also because I don\u2019t like Han Yuqing.][That\u2019s why this wedding banquet wasn\u2019t grand. It could be said to be very modest.][As for the congratulatory guests?][Except for Xue Yuanshan, the city lord of Xue City, not a single one was invited.][Oh yes, there will be one person who will come uninvited.][That would be my other fianc\u00e9e, Xue Menghan.][Xue Menghan was so delighted that she gave me a big red envelope and wished me and Han Yuqing a heartfelt blessing, saying, \u201cI hope that you two, husband and wife, will have a beautiful child soon and be together forever and love each other for the rest of your lives.\u201d][And then, as the dog-licking villain, I licked at her, saying that even though I was married to Han Yuqing, I still loved her Xue Meng Han for the rest of my life.]\u201cBah, the hell with your love, I don\u2019t care!\u201dXue Menghan\u2019s face, couldn\u2019t stop herself from getting slightly flushed.[Since the first female lead is here, how could there be a shortage of Ling Aotian, the male lead?][So, after Ling Aotian met the Lihua, he rushed to the Wuyou Sect][At the wedding banquet, he angrily reprimanded me, saying that I already had Han Yuqing and forced Xue Menghan to marry me on the basis of the marriage certificate, and wasn\u2019t a good person, anyway, just a scolding.][And I the villain became so angry, of course I punched him.][As a result, I was beaten up by him Back-N-Blue in return.][And as for my wife, Han Yuqing, she gave Ling Aotian a token fears beating.][After that, Han Yuqing secretly approached Ling Aotian, saying that she saw his guts and potential and wanted to invest in him and work with him.][Damn, I\u2019m old and miserable.][That\u2019s it for today.]Finished writing.Jiang Mu closed the diary.\u201cGive me something good, dog system.\u201d[Ding!

Strip, transfer.. Use it once unconditionally..\u201dIn other words, he could take away one of someone else\u2019s abilities, spirit arts, immortal arts, or physique, and transfer it to someone else or to himself.\u201cIn that case, It just so happens that I resurrected Han Yuqing and Ding Nanrong earlier and was divided up with Stealth and Counter Damage skills.\u201d\u201cAnd it just so happens that this what\u2019s-its-name \u2018Art of Extreme Dao Shift\u2019 can only be used twice.\u201d\u201cThen wouldn\u2019t I.. Can I get my stealth and Counter Damage skills?\u201dJiang Mu felt very nice, but after thinking about it, it felt pretty useless again.Because even if I did get them back, stealth and Counter-Damage could only be used once. It didn\u2019t seem to be of much use.\u201cThis dog system, it rewards all kinds of crap.\u201d\u201cYou could give me a realm boost, don\u2019t you know I\u2019m going to be beaten up by Ling Aotian tonight.\u201d\u201cIf not, just give me a healing or attack or acceleration spell.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you understand that you have to be tough as iron to get beaten up on regular basis ?\u201d\u201cDog system.\u201dJiang Mu was very dissatisfied with today\u2019s reward.He took another close look at the Art of Extreme Dao Shift.\u201cEh?\u201d He suddenly brilliant idea crossed his mind.\u201cAbilities, spirit arts, immortal arts, physiques..\u201d\u201cSeems like a lot of room for manoeuvre.\u201d\u201cEspecially abilities and physiques.\u201dHe knew it well.Abilities, basically, were abilities that were unique to each realm, such asThose of the Returning Realm: spiritual pressure, Flight technique, imperial sword skill, and so on..Those of the Void Practicing Realm: Practicing Void Transformation, Void Dissolution..For the Empty Void realm: hiding emptiness, breaking emptiness..For the Martial God realm: rebirth of severed limbs, divine consciousness, soul condensation..For the Immortal realm: nirvana rebirth, unbreakable soul, one dimensional world..\u201cIn other words..Let\u2019s just say, that If I deprive Ding Nanrong of her flight technique.\u201d\u201cThen I would be able to use flight once and Ding Nanrong, on the other hand, loses her flight technique permanently.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the same as.. Throwing a permanent debuff on someone, right?\u201dJiang Mu couldn\u2019t help but glance back at the sleeping Ding Nanrong.\u201cAs for physique.. There is such a thing as awakening.\u201dPhysique, referring to the five major physiques: the Innate Yuan Body, the Innate Spirit Body, the Demon Ancestor Bloodline, the Moon God\u2019s Body, and the Martial God\u2019s Reincarnation.\u201cIf I deprive Ding Nanrong of her Water Elemental Body, then, I can awaken the power of the water element once.\u201d\u201cSince awakening is the equivalent of a one-time switch, after awakening, I will always have Water Elemental Body physique.\u201d\u201cAs for Ding Nanrong, she will become an ordinary cultivator and will never advance ever again.\u201d\u201cThis Art of Extreme Dao Shift seems pretty awesome if used in right way, Hmm!\u201dJust imagine, if one were to find a dragon, the dragon\u2019s physique is one of the five great physiques, such as the body of fire element.Then deprive this dragon of its Body of Fire element and transfer it to himself.Then wouldn\u2019t one become a powerhouse?\u201cHmm, not bad, not bad.\u201d Jiang Mu felt satisfied with today\u2019s reward after giving some thought.Suddenly. There was a \u2018clang\u2019 heard. The sound came from his own bedroom next door.It seemed that someone had knocked over the table or something.\u201cSomeone has entered my room? Fuck! It can\u2019t be that dead bitch again!\u201dJiang Mu was startled, but quickly calmed down.\u201cNope, not possible. That dead bitch was absorbed so much Soul Devouring Poison by me, plus she was injured by Ding Nanrong, so she\u2019ll definitely be countered by Ding Nanrong\u2019s \u2018Forced Steel Body\u2019.\u201d\u201cTherefore, she needs to recuperate and heal, it\u2019s impossible for her to come to me so soon.\u201dAt that moment, an anxious and painful woman\u2019s voice came through.\u201cHusband! Where are you.. Where!\u201d?????It was Han Yuqing? What\u2019s wrong with her!Jiang Mu hurried through the small door and entered his bedroom.\u201cCrap!\u201d He was shocked to see it.A pale Han Yuqing was leaning over the overturned table.She was clenching her dry, cracked lips, her forehead gushing with cold, her blood-covered hands desperately trying to hold onto the edge of the table, her legs weak and unsteady.And her long lake-blue dress, covered in dirt and grass debris, was worn and tattered.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you!\u201d Jiang Mu was frightened and went to help her up.But then he suddenly thought of his own villainous persona.He was not allowed to show emotions like concern for her.Because it would cause the relationship to move forward.. Warming, my ass!Shit. Han Yuzheng\u2019s situation is obviously a serious problem, right!They\u2019re all crooked anyway!Then I will be crooked too! Fair enough, right?!Damn it! Jiang Mu no longer cared about the bullshit villain persona.He quickly ran to Han Yuqing\u2019s side and picked her up by the waist.Then placed her on his own bed.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? your clothes are all torn and you why are you like this?\u201dJiang Mu\u2019s eyebrows, his expression full of concern sincerely.The clothes on Han Yuqing\u2019s abdomen and chest had been worn to tatters, and the white skins were faintly visible which were now covered in dirt.\u201cAlso, what\u2019s with your legs again?\u201d He lifted Han Yuqing\u2019s skirt.A pair of long, well-proportioned, snow-white, yet densely covered with horrific scars, legs were exposed.A closer look also showed signs of skin on her legs that was, surprisingly, slowly shrinking!\u201cHusband.. My legs.. I\u2019ve been poisoned by a black water snake.. You must get the elixir to dispel the poison.. Help me get rid of the poison.. Quickly.. Quickly..\u201dHan Yuqing clutched onto Jiang Mu\u2019s hand.She was terrified now, afraid that she would die.Unexpectedly, this Blackwater Snake poison was actually so overwhelming.So overbearing that she couldn\u2019t completely suppress it, the toxin had spread throughout her legs, causing them to almost completely lose all sensation.They had even begun to atrophy.Although, she had made this journey back somehow, but almost half of the way back she was crawling.It was an all-night crawl!\u201cBlack water snake poison again?\u201dJiang Mu finally snapped.Fuck!!!This dead bitch, was trying to kill Han Yuqing too!!!Shit!!!Was she done with this or not!!!Jiang Mu was furious!Like Ding Nanrong, Han Yuqing had already died once, what if she died again?Damn it, if it was possible, he would like to beat Black Water Fury to death!But for now, shaking his head, Jiang Mu calmed down forcefully and sighed helplessly.The first priority was to heal Han Yuqing\u2019s legs first.So he reassured her, saying.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll help you get rid of the poison, trust me.\u201d\u201cMmm! I believe.. Husband..\u201dHan Yuqing tried her best to smile, but due to the mixture of fear and pain, so much so that the smile was unusually ugly.Jiang Mu stretched out his fingers and used his nails to forcefully cut the skin off her calf.Then he didn\u2019t care about the horrific scars on her leg.He went straight down with his mouth open.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I can feel my leg!\u201dHan Yuqing\u2019s previous worries and fears were instantly swept away.She excitedly lifted up that leg and slowly did a stretching and kicking motion.She found that apart from the fact that it was still a little numb, there was basically no more damage.As for the shriveled and wrinkled skin, it could be healed slowly by applying a good elixir.\u201cThere\u2019s still the other leg, I\u2019ll continue to help you get rid of it.\u201dJiang Mu cut the skin off her calf with his nails with force.Then covered it with his mouth and continue baring it up.\u201cOk~~! Thank you, Husband Ahh!\u201dHan Yuqing replied sweetly.She wasn\u2019t worried at all now.If Jiang Mu could even do the resurrection thing, then getting rid of a small poison wouldn\u2019t be a piece of cake?She smiled as she watched him suck on it and took the opportunity of this skin-to-skin contact to talk to him, trying to draw closer to each other.\u201cHusband, what does it feel like when you suck on my leg?\u201d\u201c\u2014\u201dThis was something that only you pervert could ask for.Jiang Mu didn\u2019t pay any attention to her.\u201cHusband, my leg is starting to feel eh, it\u2019s like something keeps flowing out and being sucked into your mouth, what\u2019s the taste?\u201d\u201c\u2014\u201dWhy did it feel like there were hidden words in her words?\u201cRight Husband, I remembered, I seem to be wearing only a skirt, only a skirt oh.\u201d\u201c\u2014-\u201d\u201cDo you want to see it, husband, hey.\u201d\u201c\u2014-\u201d\u201cShould I lift it up?\u201d\u201cWill you shut up.\u201dJiang Mu gave her a hard stare.\u201cOkay, if Husband tells me to shut up, then I\u2019ll shut up.\u201dHan Yuqing did as she was told and shut up.However, it didn\u2019t take long for her to start talking again.\u201cRight, Husband, do you like snake head soup?\u201d\u201c\u2014\u201dJiang Mu ignored her and continued to bury his head in bitter sucking.\u201cI\u2019ll make snake head soup for Husband later, okay?\u201d\u201c\u2014-\u201d\u201cDoes Husband like it bitter or spicy?\u201d\u201c\u2014\u201dDo you want to add some more ketchup?Jiang Mu was speechless.Seeing that Jiang Mu hadn\u2019t said anything, Han Yuqing also had the sense to stop talking.While she was bored, she called up her diary.She wanted to see if today\u2019s diary had been updated.So she turned to the latest page.She looked at it carefully.Finally, she found a diary entry about herself.[Tonight, I\u2019m getting married to Han Yuqing.]Wow. I almost forgot, tonight is the day of the wedding.Han Yuzheng just remembered this event.So with a happy face, she said.\u201cHusband! We\u2019re getting married tonight, I\u2019m very happy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2014\u201dJiang Mu didn\u2019t want to talk at all.He just wanted to hurry up and finish getting rid of the poison, so that she could do what she needed to do.Seeing this, Han Yuqing also stopped speaking.Continued reading the diary.[But according to the villain\u2019s persona, I don\u2019t like Han Yuqing. I like Xue Menghan]According to the villain\u2019s persona .. He doesn\u2019t like me.So what if \u2026 Not according to the villain persona?What about himself? Does he like me?Han Yuqing was suddenly curious.Although she was pretty and had high cultivation qualifications.But with scars all over her body, would he like it?No man would like it, right?Ha! Who cares, as long as I can achieve my goal, then nothing matters.Han Yuqing continued to read her diary.[At the wedding reception\u2026 I got punched by Ling Aotian and flew away.][Han Yuqing.. As a token, she beat up Ling Aotian.][.. Secretly approached Ling Aotian and said that she saw his guts and potential and wanted to invest in him and work with him]Huh? So according to the plot, I was going to work with Ling Aotian anyway?Then.. Does that mean I\u2019m ahead of schedule?Han Yuqing\u2019s face turned odd.The reason she had taken advantage of the hunting season to go to the Demonic Beast Mountain Range.It was because she knew that Ling Aotian was the main character.That was why she had the idea to collaborate with Ling Aotian.And after she used the \u2018Buyang Seven\u2019 to test out Ling Aotian, she found that he had really good potential.So she approached him on the spot and made a collaboration with him.Close the diary and look at Jiang Mu, who was burying his head and sucking hard. Han Yuqing couldn\u2019t help but think.Jiang Mu must know what her fate was.Then, this goal of hers to use the Wuyou Sect in the future to attack the Xuanyang Sect .. could be achieved?And where would she end up?Curious, I\u2019m very curious \u2026One hour later.\u201cAlright, finished getting rid of the poison, you can walk around.\u201dJiang Mu let go of Han Yuqing\u2019s legs and gestured for Han Yuqing to stand up and walk.\u201cOkay~~!\u201dHan Yuqing slowly stood up and tried to walk back and forth around the room.Jiang Mu, on the other hand, went to set the overturned table right and sat down on a chair to rub and press his temples.By the way, he checked the Poison Explosion Pill in his dantian and found that it had grown several times larger.It looked like it shouldn\u2019t be a problem to poison an ordinary Returning Yuan Mirror cultivator.\u201cI\u2019m better! Husband is so powerful!\u201dHan Yuqing hugged him in excitement from behind.Chu! And gave him a kiss on the cheek.Wipe!\u201cGet out get out! Leave me alone!\u201dJiang Mu pushed her away.\u201cOh, then I\u2019ll go make snake head soup for Husband\u2019s health, Husband wait for me!\u201dWith that, Han Yuqing was about to head out the door.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Jiang Mu called out to her.He had to find out what happened between Han Yuqing and the Black Water Fury.\u201cTell me about how you got poisoned by the Black Water Snake, hmm .. Let\u2019s start with yesterday.\u201d\u201cOkay~~, yesterday, there was a golden pupil snake demon ..\u201dHan Yuqing told the story of how Ding Nanrong was injured by the snake demon yesterday.To the incident where she tracked the snake demon and killed it inside the waterfall cave.Then to what happened when she crawled back after being poisoned by the black water snake.The whole thing was told at once.\u201c!!!\u201dJiang Mu finished listening.His mind exploded like a thunderstorm. Instantly the sky spun, and he felt like losing consciousness.Fortunately, there was the precedent of Han Yuqing and Ding Nanrong\u2019s deaths ahead of him.He was able to calm down slowly.In other words \u2026Black Water Fury Is Dead!The third female protagonist.. Killed by the Female villain.!!Ha! Haha!!!Jiang Mu laughed inwardly depressed and took a deep breath and tried desperately to calm himself down.Then, with an expressionless face, he said to Han Yuqing\u201cSo, the snake head soup you\u2019re talking about is taking that golden pupil snake demon and you\u2019re planning use it for a soup, Is that it?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Han Yuqing smiled sweetly.From the Space Ring, she took out a half-cut snake head and snake body.\u201cHusband, take a look.\u201d\u201cThis little snake demon, it\u2019s still practitioner of the Void Realm, it must be a great tonic.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it to make soup for you now, Husband.\u201d\u201cWait for me.\u201dWith that, she turned around happily and left.\u201c\u2026No need, you can give me the snake.\u201dJiang Mu shook his head and sighed.\u201cHuh? Why?\u201d Han Yuqing cocked her head in disbelief.\u201cDon\u2019t you want the soup? This snake is still fresh.\u201d\u201cNo. Give me the snake and don\u2019t bother me after that.\u201d\u201cOh, okay~~.\u201d Han Yuqing didn\u2019t ask too many questions.She acted like a good obedient wife and put the snake on the table in a good manner.Then, giving Jiang Mu a sweet smile, she went out, and closed the door.\u201c\u2014\u201dLooking at the half of the snake\u2019s head and body on the table.Jiang Mu didn\u2019t show an overwhelming emotional reaction.It was even surprising that there was a bit of \u2026 feeling of gloating?But more than that.It was to feel a pang of nausea.\u201cIf I really drank the snake head soup.\u201d\u201cAnd then Resurrection would be..\u201dVomit!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s hard to choice to make.\u201dAn optional task of whether to resurrect or not.Jiang Mu wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201cCould it be that this last reincarnation is going to be a failure?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll return to reality empty-handed?\u201d\u201cWhat a dog system!\u201dJiang Mu opened his personal rewards panel.Trying to see his current rewards.[Name: Jiang Mu][Temperament: 20/100][Face Value: 20/100][Reward \u2460: Body of Pretending to Take a Beating][Reward \u2461: Goodly Waist][Reward \u2462: The Body That Bears All Poisons][Reward \u2463: Su Sheng of the Dead (Rules)][Reward \u2464: Celestial One Eye (Spiritual Arts)][Reward (vi): Book of Souls (Spiritual Arts)][Reward \u2466: Transformation Technique (Immortal Technique)][Reward \u2467: Art of Extreme Dao Shift (Immortal Technique)][Hint: Click on the reward to see details]\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cTransformation Technique\u2026\u201dJiang Mu suddenly had a flash of inspiration.\u201cCould I, using the Transformation Technique, turn a character into the appearance of a Blackwater Fury?\u201d\u201cAnd then let this character, instead of Blackwater Fury, go through the plot?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cFuck, it\u2019s not feasible.\u201dHe simply gave up on the idea.After all, it simply wouldn\u2019t work with only the same appearance and everything else being different.\u201cSo, in the diary rewards later on\u2026\u201d\u201cWill there be something like duplicate abilities, duplicate personalities\u2026 Some kind of reward like that?\u201d\u201cAnd then I\u2019ll create another Blackwater Fury out of it?\u201dJiang Mu couldn\u2019t help but run his thoughts wild.Then he shook his head no again, because it was too ambiguous.After all, no one knew what rewards would be given tomorrow.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard, hard, hard.\u201dJiang Mu shook his head and sighed.He so wanted to drink a bottle of Fatty Happy water right now, lazily lying on the sun lounger and emptying his head of anything. (Notes: another name for Coca-Cola.)While he was thinking, the door of the room separated from Ding Nanrong\u2019s bedroom was opened.Ding Nanrong, wearing a short bustier dress, came to Jiang Mu\u2019s side.She looked at the snake\u2019s head and body on the table and asked in confusion.\u201cWhere did the snake come from?\u201dJiang Mu sighed back and said.\u201cThis is the golden-pupil snake demon that was killed by Han Yuqing.\u201d\u201c?\u201dDing Nanrong frowned slightly, puzzled, and said.\u201cThis snake looks like it\u2019s just an ordinary non-poisonous water snake.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not even a demonic beast, are you sure it\u2019s that Golden Pupil Snake Demon?\u201dJiang Mu nodded back, \u201cFor sure, she had her soul completely destroyed by Han Yuqing.\u201dThe Black Water Fury was the state of the soul.She had condensed her soul and seized this ordinary water snake.In other words, this water snake had died long ago, and it was just a vessel for the Black Water Fury.Ding Nanrong looked at the snake, then looked at Jiang Mu and asked.\u201cWhy did this snake bother to find you? And knocked you unconscious but didn\u2019t kill?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.I don\u2019t know, maybe in the demon beast mountain range, she saw that I was so handsome and wanted to abduct me back.\u201dJiang Mu didn\u2019t know how to explain, so he had to make up a perfunctory story while averting her gaze.Handsome?Ding Nanrong looked at him with an odd expression on her face.Even though she was not interested in men, she felt that Jiang Mu\u2019s looks were indeed\u2026 Quite eye-catching.Since the snake was dead now.Then there was no need for her to stay by Jiang Mu\u2019s side all the time to protect him.\u201cI\u2019m going to the cliff at the back of the mountain to meditate.\u201dAfter dropping a sentence, she headed out of the room.Looking at her departing back.In Jiang Mu\u2019s mind, he felt something flicker.\u201cRong\u2019er wait!\u201dDing Nanrong turned and looked back at him in confusion.Jiang Mu came to her side and circled around her.And under his breath he muttered.\u201cHmm\u2026 That\u2019s strange\u2026 What is it?\u201dHe had a feeling that he might be able to find something to solve the Black Water Fury predicament from Ding Nanrong.But that was something that eluded him for a moment.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dPerhaps annoyed by the turn of events, Ding Nanrong said indifferently.\u201cYou should cultivate well when you have this free time, I can save you once in time, there is no guarantee that there will be a next time.\u201d\u201cWhat is it\u2026 What is it\u2026\u201dJiang Mu acted as if he hadn\u2019t heard her words, still circling around her on his own.Ding Nanrong\u2019s face gradually turned cold.\u201cDon\u2019t think you can be so rude to me just because you sucked out the Black Water Snake Poison from my body and saved me.\u201dBlackwater snake poison?Jiang Mu gave a start and stopped to think about it.Blackwater snake poison\u2026Blackwater snake poison\u2026Blackwater snake poison\u2026 Poison Explosion Pill?\u201cCrap! That\u2019s right, I got it!\u201dJiang Mu\u2019s eyes lit up with excitement and he almost jumped up and down.He\u2019d thought of a solution!A solution that specializes in curing the Black Water Fury!A solution that would definitely work!!!\u201cThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s the Black Water Snake Poison! Rong\u2019er, you\u2019re so right!!!\u201dJiang Mu excitedly and subconsciously hugged Ding Nanrong in his arms.He even picked her up and spun her around a few times.The spin made Ding Nanrong\u2019s long braids flutter beautifully.\u201cPut me down, or die, one of two choices.\u201dA cold voice reached Jiang Mu\u2019s ears.\u201c!\u201dJiang Mu shuddered in fear and immediately put her down.Then he snorted and smiled sarcastically and said.\u201cRong\u2019er, don\u2019t mind, I just want to weigh how heavy you are.\u201d\u201cHm?!\u201dDing Nanrong\u2019s gaze flinched as the spiritual energy aura on her body suddenly surged out.Shit! She\u2019s angry?She\u2019s going to beat me up!Jiang Mu really wanted to give himself a slap in the mouth.It was all his fault for saying the rude thing in his excitement.\u201cThat\u2026 Rong\u2019er ah, I mean, you have everything you should have and nothing you shouldn\u2019t have, no need to lose weight at all!\u201dHe said, holding his arms out and holding his head high.Prepare yourself to be punched by her.\u201cStupid.\u201dDing Nanrong said coldly.Then withdrew her breath.Without looking back, she walked out of the room.????She didn\u2019t beat me up?Jiang Mu felt strange.I remembered that I had hugged her during the first reincarnation.It was when flying with the sword, and since he was uncomfortable with the swordsickness, he had to hold her behind him.I don\u2019t know if it was the wrong position to hug or what.Anyway, the result was that I got beaten up by her and was thrown off the flying sword and broke my leg.\u201cCould it be that because I saved and healed her, she forgave me for transgressing the rules this time?\u201d\u201cForget it doesn\u2019t matter, her persona is already off anyway.\u201d\u201cThe most important thing now is to resurrect that dead bitch!\u201dJiang Mu came to the table excitedly.Glanced at the head and body of the snake on the table.Then opened [Su Sheng of the Dead]Check out the information.[Reward: Su Sheng of the Dead (Rule)[Description: Heaven is the father.

(Example:\u00a0Click Here)Even if she grimaced and resisted, she couldn\u2019t stop dancing.\u201cAs expected of the technique from God-level cultivator Black Water Soul Erosion Technique is best.\u201d\u201cHahahaha!\u201dHaving taken control of the Black Water Fury, Jiang Mu\u2019s heart felt satisfied and finally calmed down.There was no fear of her In the future messing with him and Ding Nanrong and the girls.Or fear that she wouldn\u2019t follow the plot either.As he thought about future events.

There was no way out.The Black Water Soul Etching Technique is an unbreakable technique from years of training.After being trapped, one either had to resign to their fate or die.And her physical body had yet to be regained, and her enemies had yet to be destroyed.So, there was no way she could commit suicide.\u201cGood girl.\u201dJiang Mu stroked her little head.At that moment, the door to the room was pushed open.Ding Nanrong walked in and said to Jiang Mu.\u201cIt\u2019s the auspicious time, the elders have asked you to go to the ancestral hall to get married.\u201d\u201cAll right\u201dJiang Mu replied back.Turning his head to look down, he found that the Black Water Fury had already disappeared.It looked like she had used spatial spirit magic or something to hide.So he went out with Ding Nanrong.Preparing to have a simple marriage with Han Yuqing, briefly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lihua, the Pavilion Master of Lihua Pavilion, has come to visit with gifts!\u201dWho? Not Xue Menghan?Jiang Mu for a moment couldn\u2019t remember who Lihua was due to be a bit confused.Then, a pair of charming and seductive Phoenix eyes gradually surfaced in his mind.Crap? Could it be that fourth female lead\u2026 Lihua?Jiang Mu looked towards the door of the ancestral hall in astonishment.He saw an enchanting woman clad in a white silk jacket, stepping into the ancestral hall.She was wearing a sexy and revealing slit silk dress, with her long, sexy white legs, twisting her sexy waist that was not too big to hold.Enchantingly, she came in front of Jiang Mu.F*ck!Why is this demon coming!The raccoon girl\u2019s eyes were smiling as she gazed at Jiang Mu.A soft and melodious voice came out from her bright red lips.\u201cLihua, has heard of Patriarch Jiang\u2019s wedding and has come to bless you.\u201dThe crispy voice fell.A few servant girls behind her, then carried several exquisite boxes and placed them on the ground.The raccoon woman smiled and said.\u201cBlessings to Patriarch Jiang and Madam Han, happiness and eternal love to you two.\u201dBetween her knitted brows and smiles, her shapely body and visible sexy long legs seemed to exude an alluring magic.It tempted some of the male elders and deacons present to have their blood rushing out and breathing hard.\u201cShe is\u2026 The Pavilion Master of the Lihua Pavilionn?\u201d\u201cOne of the three great beauties of Xue City?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard that the demonic charm of the Lihua that tempts people to sin, but when I see it today, it\u2019s indeed true!\u201d\u201cHow beautiful!\u201d\u2026\u201cI thank\u2026 Thank you.\u201dJiang Mu smiled stiffly and said thanks.Yet in his heart, he had already cursed the heavens.Damn, this demon.Shouldn\u2019t she be staying at the Lihua Pavilion!Why had she come here to cause trouble?Damn it!Ugh\u2026 Crooked, all the main characters are crooked.The dog system had secretly modified the characters\u2019 personas, causing the plot to go more and more crooked.Jiang Mu was helpless.The course of the plot was crooked now.And the only thing he could do was to try to ensure that the outcome of the plot didn\u2019t deviate, and thus the main line didn\u2019t deviate.Lihua suddenly leaned close to Jiang Mu\u2019s ear, breathing like an orchid and softly whispering.\u201cThe door to the Lihua Pavilion girl\u2019s room will always be wide open for you, Patriarch Jiang~\u201cDiscount, and order one, get one free!\u201cRemember to come and play often~\u201dAfter saying that, she threw a winks to Jiang Mu.Then, wriggling her waist, she went to stand next to Ding Nanrong.Shit, this demon. Whispering this to me during my marriage?Not bad for a demon persona!But that shitty pavilion of yours, it had somehow blacklisted out this Laozi before, alright!Jiang Mu was furious when he thought of this incident.So he secretly decided to order ten next time there!***Ding Nanrong looked at the sultry woman beside her and was curious.So this Lihua, was the so-called\u2026 The fourth female lead?Remember what the diary content mentioned.At tonight\u2019s wedding banquet, only three outsiders, Xue Yuanshan, Xue Menghan, and Ling Aotian, were coming.So is the arrival of this Lihua a distortion of the plot?Ding Nanrong couldn\u2019t help but be curious and asked.\u201cI remember you, three years ago during the war in the Demon Beast Mountain Range, you fled Xue City to go to the Changyu Empire, why are you suddenly coming to the Wuyou Sect now?\u201dWith a charming smile, Lihua responded back.\u201cI respect the warriors of the Wuyou Sect who fought against the demons, and I heard about your patriarch\u2019s wedding, so I came to congratulate him.\u201dAs she spoke, her eyes scanned Ding Nanrong\u2019s figure without fear.So this is Jiang Mu\u2019s daoist partner?She was so beautiful and big, I wondered if Jiang Mu could handle her at all.At this moment.\u201cA guest has arrived!\u201dOutside the ancestral hall, the sound of another disciple\u2019s announcement came.Now it was Xue Menghan who was coming!Jiang Mu\u2019s mind was set and he immediately entered into character.Continuing to prepare for the arrival of the dog-licking drama.\u201cReporting to the Sovereign! Ling Aotian\u2026 Hey what are you doing! Ah! Hitting someone! Fuck you! *help*????What the hell!Someone is making a scene?!Not only Jiang Mu, but everyone present, was bewildered.Bang! A disciple flew in backwards and landed heavily on the ground.After spitting out a few mouthfuls of blood, he rolled his eyes and fainted.Then. A handsome man with an imposing style and an evil gaze.Stepping into the ancestral hall with a steady pace.F*ck!Why is Ling Aotian here already!Jiang Mu\u2019s eyes widened.According to the original plot, it was Xue Menghan who came in first!She hadn\u2019t come, had she\u2026Jiang Mu looked anxiously behind Ling Aotian.Then he saw a young girl in a long emerald green dress.That was Xue Menghan.It was all right.It\u2019s good that she\u2019s here.I see, it must be because the Lihua didn\u2019t ask Ling Aotian to go to the Lihua pavilion.That\u2019s why, Ling Aotian followed Xue Menghan and came early.But why would Ling Aotian get violent and hit someone?Before Jiang Mu could ask a question out loud.One of the Deacons from the Wuyou Sect pointed at Ling Ao Tian and angrily shouted.\u201cWhere is this wild boy from! How dare you injure a disciple of my Wuyou Sect?\u201dLing Aotian\u2019s gaze was austere as he stared at the deacon and said coldly.\u201cNone of your business!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re looking for death!\u201dThe elder was furious.He directly punched Ling Aotian with his full strength at the second level of Qi Sea Mirror violently.Ling Ao Tian sneered.\u201cA mere second layer of Qi Sea Mirror, who doesn\u2019t know his place!\u201dWith his cultivation of Spirit Gathering Mirror, he threw a fist with his full strength.Boom!Fist against fist.That deacon retreated from wherever he came from.This bastard is actually so formidable!!!Looking at the overbearing Ling Aotian, a group of deacons drew in cold breaths backwards.\u201cStop!\u201dJiang Mu called a halt to the elders who were about to attack.Shit, it was obvious that this dog plot was skewed too.There was no way out.Only by improvising and going hard.Jiang Mu immediately got into character.Pointing at Ling Aotian, he shouted angrily.\u201cIt\u2019s you hillbilly! What are you doing here!\u201dLing Aotian took a step forward and stared at Jiang Mu with a cold, stern gaze.\u201cI\u2019m here for Menghan, to seek justice!\u201d\u201cJustice?\u201d Jiang Mu was stunned.He couldn\u2019t help but look at Xue Menghan.He found that her eyes were slightly red.She seemed to be\u2026 crying?Xue Menghan came in front of Jiang Mu, put her hands behind her back, showed a smile that looked forced, and said.\u201cThat\u2026 Patriarch Jiang, bless you, and Han Yuqing.\u201d\u201cI hope that you two, husband and wife, will have a beautiful child soon and be together forever and love each other for the rest of your lives.\u201cThis is a congratulatory gift from me to you.\u201dAs she said, she took out an expensive box and gave it to Jiang Mu.Jiang Mu casually tossed the congratulatory gift to Ding Nanrong, who was on the side.Then, turning on his dog-licking character, he said with affection.\u201cMenghan, thank you for your congratulatory gift.\u201d\u201cAlthough I am married to Han Yuqing, I still love you too.\u201d\u201cEven if you have said that you want to withdraw from marriage, even if you tear up your marriage certificate, I am still not willing to give up this marriage certificate of mine.\u201d\u201cBecause, I really love you so much.\u201d\u201cMenghan, No matter what, I will love you for the rest of my life.\u201d\u201c!!!!\u201dXue Menghan hurriedly lowered her head, her face slightly red, and her heartbeat slightly accelerated.In fact, she had been thinking about it all day. She did not want to come to Jiang Mu\u2019s wedding banquet.But when she thought that Jiang Mu would say the words \u2018love you for the rest of your life\u2019 to her.Then somehow, suddenly, she wanted to come.And just now.When she stepped into the mountain gate of the Wuyou Sect, but somehow\u2026. The eyes got red.The feeling of wanting to cry so badly.And now, after actually hearing him say \u2018love you for life\u2019.I don\u2019t know how, but I actually feel a little \u2026.. Shy?But then again, thinking that he will be married to Han Yuqing later \u2026..I don\u2019t know how, my heart is a little \u2026. It hurts.Thinking about it.Xue Menghan\u2019s eyes, actually gradually moistened up again.She was afraid that people would find out about her different condition.So she immediately turned her head and ran out.This state of hers just happened to be seen by Ling Aotian again, and anger instantly rose to his heart.It must be because of the man named Jiang!He had already married Han Yuqing, yet he still didn\u2019t take the initiative to hand over the marriage certificate?And now he was actually saying that he would love Xue Menghan for life in front of Han Yuqing?What a shameless beastly act!The more Ling Aotian thought about it, the more furious he became.He pointed at Jiang Mu and angrily rebuked him.\u201cWhen a man and woman love each other, they need to be in love with each other!\u201cAnd yet you rely on a piece of paper for marriage to confine Menghan\u2019s wings and prevent her from finding true love?\u201cWhat kind of a man are you?\u201cYou don\u2019t treat your wife with devotion, yet you think of having two wives at once?\u201cWhat kind of a husband are you?\u201cToday, I will do justice for Menghan!!!\u201dLing Aotian clenched his fists and shouted angrily.\u201cIf you are a man! Fight me alone!\u201dHe burst out of spiritual power and rushed towards Jiang Mu.That fist gathered a terrifying aura of spiritual energy.\u201cLet\u2019s fight each other! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201dJiang Mu also released his spiritual power to charge at him.Holy shit.Luckily, I have the \u2018Body of Pretending to Take a Beating\u2019, which can counteract 50% of the damage.Otherwise, with this weak chicken body, I would have been punched to hell in one go.However, before Jiang Mu could move.\u201cAh\u2026!!!\u201dLing Aotian suddenly stopped moving his body and wailed miserably.A closer look.It was revealed.Around his body, there was a ripple of space.And one of his arms had actually been snapped off before, he knew it out of nowhere!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The invisible force withdrew and Ling Aotian collapsed to the ground in pain.He stared vengefully at Jiang Mu, his anger overflowing as he said.\u201cIt was agreed\u2026 One-on-one! Despicable \u2026. Villain!!!\u201dCrap? What the hell is this?Jiang Mu was dumbfounded.He turned his head to look left and right.Trying to see who the hell had made a move suddenly out of nowhere.Only to find that almost everyone\u2019s faces had doubt written all over them.One of the elders voiced out a guess and said.\u201cI saw the spatial ripples just now, that was clearly the result of a spatial spirit art.\u201d\u201cAnd spatial spirit techniques can only be used if one has reached the Void Practitioner realm.\u201d\u201cCould it be that \u2026. is that the Third Elder has successfully broken through to the Void Practising Realm and has come out of seclusion?\u201dVoid Practicing Realm? The Third Elder?The elders and deacons present were all pleasantly surprised, all looking around for a sign of the Third Elder.All the high-ranking cultivators of the Wuyou Sect, especially those at the Void Practitioner Realm, had fallen in the battle of the Demon Beast Mountain Range three years ago.This had caused the Wuyou Sect\u2019s mountain-like status to plummet straight to the bottom.Now, if the Third Elder Brother succeeded in breaking through to the Void Practicing Realm.Then, the status of the Wuyou Sect would be raised to a higher level!Practicing the Void Realm, my ass!Those were born only in the middle and late stages!Jiang Mu was furious.He already knew what was going on.There were no Void Realm cultivators in the Wuyou Sect here but.There\u2019s that Black Water Fury bitch.She had broken her own disciple\u2019s hand!Why? Damn it, no matter why, she would have to be punished later for her unauthorized action!Thinking indignantly, Jiang Mu glanced at Han Yuqing beside him.Covered in a red veil, she was waiting quietly and obediently for the wedding ceremony.Since she didn\u2019t give a beating to Ling Aotian, like in the original plot, then there\u2019s no choice, he had to do it himself.So, Jiang Mu proceeded to follow the plot and made his way to the front of Ling Aotian, looking down at him from a high position.Arrogantly and haughtily, he said.\u201cMenghan is this Laozi\u2019s fiancee!\u201d\u201cWhy do I need you, a country bumpkin, to seek justice?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cCrawl for me!\u201dHe kicked Ling Aotian in the stomach.\u201cAHHH!!!\u201dLing Aotian was kicked out of the ancestral hall.After falling to the ground, he rolled a few times.Then he passed out.\u201cSomeone! Put this bumpkin, into the dungeon for this Patriarch!\u201d\u201cHold on, Patriarch Jiang.\u201dAt this moment, Xue Yuanshan came out to plead for Ling Aotian.He smiled warmly and said.\u201cThis son is young and impetuous, and he also rushed you in a moment of recklessness for the sake of my daughter Han\u2019er.\u201d\u201cToday is your wedding day. It is not advisable to get angry.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just sell this City Lord a favour and let him go?\u201dSaid the man as he heartily took out a fine spatial ring and secretly shoved it into Jiang Mu\u2019s hand.He had spent a lot of money and asked for many favors to find a master of the Heavenly Mystery Pavilion to customize this spatial ring.He didn\u2019t even bother to wear it himself, but he gave it away.It could not be helped.He was very optimistic about Ling Aotian\u2019s potential and that he would definitely make a difference in the future.By saving Ling Aotian now, he would be able to earn a favor.And on the day after tomorrow, the Dark Night House would be opening the ruins.Participating in the Mystery of the Voice of the Day Sun, this would be of great benefit to Ling Aotian\u2019s growth.So, no matter what, Ling Aotian couldn\u2019t be trapped here.Jiang Mu did not move and took the ring, waving his hand generously and saying.\u201cSince the prospective father-in-law has asked for it.\u201d\u201cThen I will be merciful, and spare this country bumpkin a little, someone, throw this guy out to the mountain gate.\u201dGood lord, this spatial nano ring was so exquisite, it looked like it had been custom made at a great cost.I didn\u2019t expect the plot to go wrong again, but there was actually a surprise gain?Whatever, that\u2019s it.The outcome of this plot was not too bad.Jiang Mu sort of reverted to the outcome of the plot, barely.And later on, Han Yuqing would secretly invest in Ling Ao Tian or something.But that would be none of his business.The wedding banquet continued.\u201cThe auspicious time has arrived! Please prepare the bride and groom!\u201dA long man who was acting as the master of ceremonies shouted aloud.\u201cLove is as bright as the sun and the moon, love is like a rushing river. Let\u2019s worship heaven and earth!\u201dJiang Mu and Han Yuqing, each holding the two ends of the wedding dress, paid their respects to heaven and earth.\u201cI will never forget the kindness of my parents. Two worships to the high hall!\u201dThe two bowed their heads and bent down in worship to Jiang Mu\u2019s parents\u2019 spiritual memorial.\u201cTogether in good and bad times, till death do us part. Husband and wife bow to each other!\u201dThe two turned around and bowed face to face.\u201cSend! Enter! Cave! Room!\u201d***The bedchamber of the Patriarch\u2019s Hall.A ripple of space rose up.Then, a little loli with a black dress and long, straight black pupils landed on the ground out of thin air.\u201cThis god wants to kill Ling Aotian so badly!!!\u201dBlack Water Fury was full of malice.Just now, due to boredom, she had used her divine sense to sense the status of Jiang Mu and Han Yuqing\u2019s wedding ceremony.Yet, she also sensed Ling Aotian.This made her think of her own miserable ending, the one of self-sacrifice to make Ling Aotian whole.So she became furious just remembering it.So she lurked over and used spatial spirit magic to break Ling Aotian\u2019s hand.Moreover, she deliberately broke the ring that she had lodged in.If not for the influence of Jiang Mu in her soul, she would not have been able to stop herself from killing Ling Aotian.She wanted to break Ling Aotian\u2019s head on the spot and get it over with.\u201cWhere should this God go next?\u201d\u201cWill that bastard Jiang Mu order this God to go back to Ling Aotian\u2019s side?\u201d\u201cBut this God doesn\u2019t want to go back!\u201dThe more she thought about it, too, the more worried she became.She had long since learned from her diary that Jiang Mu was to follow the plot.And as the fourth female protagonist herself, she was Ling Aotian\u2019s master.So, there was a real possibility that she herself would, in fact, be asked to return to Ling Aotian\u2019s side.\u201cThis god will definitely will not return!!!\u201dBlack Water Fury gritted her teeth and walked around the bedchamber, thinking of a countermeasure.\u201cFirstly, that son of a bitch has to be persuaded to let this God stay!\u201d\u201cSecondly, this god also has to change the course of fate and avoid the dead-end of self-sacrifice!\u201d\u201cLastly, I also have to successfully reclaim my body and exterminate the hundreds of clans above and below the Spirit Devouring Sand Worm!\u201d\u201cWhat to do \u2026. What to do \u2026.\u201d\u201cUghh I want to kill someone so badly!!!\u201dThe Black Water Fury scratched her head with deep thought.As she did so, she also stomped the ground with a \u201cThump! Thump!\u201dShe was annoyed.As she scratched, she suddenly realized.There\u2019s something new in her body, that wasn\u2019t there before, so she focused on her mind to look for what it is and found something mysterious power.\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u201d\u201cSoul\u2026 Book\u2026\u201d\u201c??\u201dThen as she looked through her mind.Surprisingly, a few lines of words surfaced.\u3010Spiritual Art: Book of Souls\u3011\u3010Description: Can create a closed space and summon souls within a certain range, into the space.\u3011\u3010Note: The higher the cultivation realm, the longer the duration of the space.\u3011\u3010Note: The higher the cultivation realm, the greater the number of souls that can be summoned.\u3011\u3010Note: The higher the cultivation realm, the wider the range that can be summoned\u3011\u201cThis is?!\u201dThe Black Water Fury stared in disbelief with her eyes wide open and her tiny mouth gaping.An expression of astonishment.As a Demon God realm cultivator, she had seen many categories of spirit arts.Yet, she had never seen a spirit art that could bring the soul into space!\u201cThis soul book \u2026. What\u2019s the use?\u201dShe felt very curious.\u201cLet\u2019s try it!\u201dAnd, as if she was self-taught, she cast it out at once.\u201cSoul Book!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Creak!A dark circle was generated with her body as the center.The circle kept expanding and expanding.It seemed to go on forever without borders.\u201cStop!\u201dWhen the circle expanded to cover the entire state of Li.The Black Water Fury immediately stopped it from continuing to expand.\u201cThis soul book, it\u2019s surprising that it consumes soul power so much.\u201dShe also found, after doing a few tests, that the larger the circle expanded, the faster the soul\u2019s power would be consumed.So with thoughts in her mind to shrink the circle.It finally shrunk to only enough to cover the entire Wuyou Sect.\u201cThis God\u2019s soul \u2026.\u201dShe looked around herself.Her own soul was, in fact, in the state of a light person.It was the same as her petite self.\u201cHow magical.\u201dShe scanned through the entire dark space.Found, apart from her own light human soul form, there were hundreds of other souls.But these souls were all in the state of light masses.\u201cI guess, these are all the souls of the disciples of the Wuyou Sect.\u201d\u201cHm? These three souls \u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy are they in the state of books?\u201dThere were three light book souls among them that caught her attention.As she had previously used her divine sense to explore the entire Wuyou Sect.Therefore, she knew very well where these three light book souls were located.\u201cOne book is at the \u2026. by the cliff at the back of the mountain.\u201d\u201cOne book is at the \u2026. mountain gate.\u201d\u201cAnd the last book, which is in \u2026. the new room next door?\u201dBlack Water Fury understood who they were.Next door, was the new room of the duo Jiang Mu and Han Yuqing.\u201cThese two should be in the bridal chamber, right?\u201d\u201cBut why are you chasing after each other \u2026.. running all over the room?\u201dBlack Water Fury watched curiously.The light book soul, was chasing after the ordinary light mass soul.Chasing it all over the room.\u2026\u201cHusband! What are you running for, come and join me in the bridal chamber, hehehe!\u201dHan Yuqing chased after Jiang Mu with a bright smile on her face.There were several times when she almost managed to pounce on him.\u201cJion, my shit!\u201dJiang Mu cursed as he tried his best to escape Han Yuqing\u2019s leap.\u201cI\u2019m warning you!\u201d\u201cMarrying you is already the limit!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get wrong idea and make a move on me!\u201dThis episode of being forced into a bridal chamber.It\u2019s so\u2026. so exciting!But I can\u2019t have sex with her.Because according to the original plot.My 1st juice was forcibly taken by Ding Nanrong, who was going berserk.\u201cHusband!\u201d Han Yuqing who was chasing after him, stopped suddenly.She pouted her little mouth with an aggrieved look.\u201cDo I not look good? or is it because Xue Menghan is younger and prettier?\u201d\u201cBut look \u2026. I\u2019m better and bigger than Xue Menghan \u2026. More fun to play with!\u201dSaid as she took out a knife and lifted her wedding dress, revealing her snow-white and densely scarred legs.But then she suddenly remembered that tonight was the night of the wedding, and it was not appropriate to see such blood.So immediately she dropped the knife and covered her pretty face and sobbed.\u201cHusband won\u2019t have a bridal chamber with me, Yuqing is sad, crying~\u201dYet Jiang Mu was indifferent and sneered.Heh. This acting skill, deserves a the next Golden Rooster Award.He knew that Han Yuqing was faking it.Everything she did was to please him, or even to satisfy his whims.As long as she succeeded in giving him her body.Then she would be able to firmly tie him down and thus gain more power.If she were to be conceived better.After all, then, the entire Wuyou Sect would practically be hers.\u201cGo ahead and cry all you want, I\u2019m going back to bed.\u201d\u201cOh yes, I\u2019m warning you.\u201d\u201cTonight is a special day, that\u2019s why this I will forgive you for transgressing the rules.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, don\u2019t even think about touching a hair on my head again, get it?\u201d Jiang Mu warned harshly.At the same time, while watching out for her, he slowly walked towards the door of the room.As soon as he stepped out of this door, then the end of his marriage with Han Yuqing would come to an end.And he still had to hurry back to punish her for Black Water Fury\u2019s unauthorised act.Just as Jiang Mu reached the door of the room.\u201cHey!\u201dHan Yuqing, who was sobbing, suddenly lunged over at him again.Dodge!Anticipating her action, Jiang Mu easily dodged her action.\u201cHusband! If you keep running away like this, I will \u2026. I\u2019ll get really angry!\u201dHan Yuqing was glaring at Jiang Mu with anger as she pushed out her round breasts.The glare made Jiang Mu couldn\u2019t help but secretly praise her.This woman, who was clearly a perverted persona, was pretending to look like a little angry woman.This sense of contrast, really \u2026. Picking people\u2019s emotions ah.\u201cWhat are you mad about?\u201d Jiang Mu maintained his villainous persona and pointed at her angrily, saying.\u201cSince you are my wife, then I order you, go to bed, and lie alone for the night!\u201d\u201cNo! Husband~\u201dHan Yuqing was aggrieved and wanted to cry.\u201cGo and lie down!\u201d\u201cHusband~\u201d\u201cLie down!\u201d\u201cOh~\u201dHan Yuqing hung her head, dragged her feet as heavyly towards the big red bed position.and sat down on the edge of the bed and looked at Jiang Mu, pitifully like abandoned cat.Her eyes were still watery, and a line of tears slowly spilled out of the corners of her eyes.The tears slid over the butterfly scars on her cheeks, adding a touch of pity to her creepy charm.She looked like an unloved and abandoned bride, whose husband was going to cheat on her bridal night.But Jiang Mu\u2019s heart was not moved slightly at all. He had seen fake such tears many times and instead took the opportunity to move slowly towards the door of the room.Suddenly, his heart stuttered.He saw from the corner of his eyes that Han Yuqing, who was crying, was now revealing a devious grin.She! What is going to \u2026. do it again?Somehow, Jiang Mu had a bad premonition.He hurriedly quickened his pace.Just when it was about to go to the door to the room.Holy Shit!! Jiang Mu\u2019s eyes widened as chills ran down his whole body.Because, Han Yuqing who was setting on the bed, suddenly went missing from the room\u2026. Invisible!!!***\u201cCaught up.\u201dThe Black Water Fury looked, with interest, at the two souls that were caught up at the end.After a while. The light book soul, it seemed, dragged by the light mass soul, to the table\u2019s position.Then, it was affixed to one another.After a while.That mass of light seemed to be trying to escape, only to be dragged again to the position of the bed by the book of light.After a while.The book of light and the mass of light, slowly began to match the rhythm.After a while.It evolved into a one-sided fierce ramming from the book of light.\u201cTsk, tsk, tsk.\u201d\u201cHuman, how superficial.\u201dThe Black Water Fury despised as she watched with widened eyes.She even started to comment on it.\u201cLight book ramming, light mass not moving, superficial.\u201d\u201cLight book doesn\u2019t move, light mass charges, superficial.\u201d\u201cLight book reverse, superficial.\u201d\u201cSide, superficial.\u201d\u201cThey collided with each other, superficial.\u201d\u201cPosition swapping so nimbly, is it an innate ability?\u201d\u201cTsk, superficial, so superficial \u2026..\u201dThe more Blackwater Fury watched, the more engrossed she got gradually.As she was watching with too much concentration.So much so that she didn\u2019t pay attention, and then the light book soul that was in the middle of the violent rampage.She summoned it in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hoooo! .. Eh??\u201dShe suddenly let out a confused voice.Because of the sudden change in experience, it became somewhat .. hollow and clogged.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me .. and what is this place?\u201dShe looked around and found herself in some mysterious dark space and realized her own soul had been forcefully pulled by someone here!And in front of her, there also stood a glowing form of a person, black-skirted, long black hair, soul of a little girl.\u201cI-It\u2019s you?!\u201dHan Yuqing recognized the Black Water Fury\u2019s appearance at a glance. After all, it was that Golden Pupil Demon Snake that she had killed earlier!\u201cYou still remember this god!\u201dThe Black Water Fury narrowed her golden vertical pupils and stared deadly at Han Yuqing.She would never forget.That night in the waterfall cave, she had been destroyed by Han Yuqing by cutting off her soul in the sky.She wanted to take revenge!Unfortunately, due to the influence of Jiang Mu\u2019s soul, she couldn\u2019t even give birth to a single thought of exterminating Han Yuqing.\u201cDo you know why this god summoned your soul here?\u201dThe Black Water Fury was still unclear about this space for the time being, what exactly it was used for.Plus, summoning Han Yuqing\u2019s soul in was completely unintentional on her own part.So she began by chatting with her to familiarize herself with the space.\u201cYou summoned me here \u2026. Is it because you want to kill me? You want to take revenge?!\u201dTerrified Han Yuqing immediately shivered.To be able to take her own soul and forcefully summon it in without a sound.How powerful did one need to be?This was definitely an existence that was beyond her reach!\u201cKill you? Take revenge? If it were possible, this God would love to turn you into a slave, and then torture you to death a little by little!\u201dThe Black Water Fury\u2019s face was full of gloom and fury.If she hadn\u2019t become Jiang Mu\u2019s slave.If she hadn\u2019t lost the Black Water Soul Eater Technique.Then she would absolutely have turned Han Yuqing, and Ding Nanrong, into her loyal slaves!And then use 1,800 different kinds of methods to slowly torture them to death!\u201cThen you summoned me in .. Why exactly? Aren\u2019t you already dead?\u201dHan Yuqing couldn\u2019t help but ask so after all she herself killed her, but.The Black Water Fury in front of her was clearly alive and well!Why?! She herself had clearly pierced her heart and cut off her head, causing her, who had a human body and snake tail, to turn back into an ordinary water snake.And she even personally gave her snake head and body to her husband \u2026. Wait!Husband? Does that mean \u2026.Did the husband \u2026. Resurrected her?If that was really the case, then why would he do that? She tried to kill him.Han Yuqing couldn\u2019t help but observe the Black Water Fury carefully.As she watched, she suddenly remembered a certain part of the diary\u2019s content.[This Black Water Fury, normally in the form of a human body with a snake\u2019s tail, is a long black hair, straight little loli when she takes human form.]Human body with snake tail.Black hair and straight.Han Yuqing\u2019s eyes gradually widened in shock as she came to the conclusion.The black long straight little girl in front of her was most likely \u2026. Black Water Fury!Immediately, she couldn\u2019t help but ask out what she thought, if her guess was right.\u201cIs your name Black Water Fury?\u201d\u201cAre you Ling Aotian\u2019s master?\u201d\u201cAre you the clan leader of the Black Water Snake Clan?\u201d\u201cHave you been resurrected by my husband?!\u201dListening to Han Yuqing\u2019s series of quick questions.The Blackwater Serpent also gradually widened her eyes. Her expression filled with shock and her voice trembled.\u201cYou .. H-how did you know that!!!\u201dHan Yuqing blurted out under the shock, \u201cBecause the diary said so!!!\u201dBlack Water Fury also blurted out in shock, \u201cA diary? You have one too?!\u201d\u201c\u201dWait, that means!!\u201d\u201d (Voice overlapped)The two women immediately stared at each other, their eyes, and mouths open so wide they could almost fit two snake fists in them.What is more shocking is that they not only have they learned both of them are in the possession of \u2018Jiang Mu\u2019s\u2019 Personal Diary but can also talk about \u2018The Diary\u2019 freely in this space ? Which was impossible on the outside.!!!\u201cYou have my Husband\u2019s diary?!\u201d \u2013 Han Yuqing\u201cYou also have that bastard\u2019s diary?!\u201d \u2013 Black Water Fury\u201cAre you the third heroine?!\u201d \u2013 Han Yuqing\u201cAre you the female villain?!\u201d \u2013 Black Water Fury\u201cYou\u2019re a dead bitch?!\u201d \u2013 Han Yuqing\u201cYou\u2019re the pervert?!\u201d \u2013 Black Water Fury\u201c!!!\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dThere was a dead silence after that.However, the silence was instantly broken by Han Yuqing\u2019s abnormality.\u201cAhhh!!!\u201d Somewhere in Han Yuqing\u2019s soul, it was as if a lightning bolt had struck through.\u201cMy .. Body .. Ahh! Ahh ahhhh! \u2026\u201dHan Yuqing wrapped her arms around herself and trembled uncontrollably.She also had her neck stretched out, her mouth open, tongue stretched out, and her eyelids rolled up.\u201cWhat are you\u2026 doing?\u201dThe Black Water Fury also gradually recovered from the shock.Looking at Han Yuqing, whose expression looked as if in bliss.She seemed to have already made a guess.So, turning to look carefully at the location of the new room, and clearly saw, That the light mass of soul.It was being violently pounded from below.\u201cSuperficial!\u201dThe Black Water Fury was disgusted it with irritation.It was rare that the diary\u2019s contents could be spoken about in this space.Only to be interrupted by this superficial thing.But she didn\u2019t get in the duo\u2019s way either.Instead, she came in front of Han Yuqing and opened her big golden eyes.Just quietly watching Han Yuqing\u2019s expression.An hour later.\u201cDamn it! Can\u2019t you guys hurry up!\u201dThe Black Water Fury was not fed up with waiting.Instead, in her heart right now, she had many, many things to say and ask.Because she had an intuition, whether she would have to go back to Ling Aotian\u2019s side will be decided after this.It was possible to find the answer from Han Yuqing, who also has the diary.However, Han Yuqing is still having sex. It\u2019s been more than an hour already and no sigs of either of them stopping at all.\u201cSuperficial!!!\u201dBlack Water Fury cursed indignantly.Yet, all she could do was wait helplessly.At that moment.Another light book entered the next room.\u201cHmm? If I remember that room is ..\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s Ding Nanrong girl, right?\u201dBlack Water Fury saw, Ding Nanrong\u2019s room, that Book of Light seemed to be walking into the bathroom just like Han Yuqing\u2019s soul.\u201cHm? The book form..\u201d\u201cHan Yuqing\u2019s soul, the form of a book.\u201d\u201cDing Nanrong\u2019s soul, too, is in the form of a book.\u201d\u201cAnd Han Yuzheng possesses a diary.\u201d\u201cThen Ding Nanrong.. Does she also have a diary?\u201d\u201cProbably!\u201dThe Black Water Fury made a positive conclusion in her mind on her own.\u201cShould I summon Ding Nanrong\u2019s soul in as well?\u201dWhile thinking, her mind was already moved to summon her soul inside this place.The next moment. Ding Nanrong, who had just stripped naked and dipped into the bathtub, was then summoned in as well.(TL: I\u2019m free now.

Why does it look so much like the space of the Senior Immortal?\u201dShe who had already been familiar with this sensation of soul being pulled was stunned for a movement.Previously, It was Senior Immortal. The one who summoned her into such a space once.But now the one standing in front of her at this moment was not any Immortal.Rather, it was a little girl with golden pupils, a black dress, and long, straight black hair.\u201cYou are \u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you? Golden Pupil Demon Snake!\u201dDing Nanrong became alert and wary immediately.The little girl in front of her was clearly the demon snake that had knocked Jiang Mu unconscious and punched through her abdomen!Subconsciously, she wanted to take out the Water Lotus Sword from her Soul Ring.However, due to the fact that she was in a soul state, she was unable to use the Space Ring.\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s this god!\u201dThe Black Water Fury caught Ding Nan Rong\u2019s movements in her eyes and sneered.\u201cNot bad for a sense of precaution, but you are no match for this god.\u201dDing Nanrong who was confused, asked in an astonishing voice.\u201cWeren\u2019t you killed by Yuqing \u2026?\u201dShe remembered that Han Yuqing had told her that the demon snake had been cut into two pieces and turned back into a normal water snake.The water snake corpse had also been given to Jiang Mu, but isn\u2019t this little girl in front of her was clearly alive?The Black Water Fury didn\u2019t answer, instead got straight to the point.\u201cWithout further ado, this god asks you, do you also possess Jiang Mu\u2019s Private Diary?\u201d\u201cA diary? How did you know that!!!\u201dDing Nanrong\u2019s eyes gradually widened, shocked beyond words.A minute later\u2026After a quick explanation from the Black Water Fury.Ding Nanrong slowly calmed down.She looked behind her at Han Yuqing, who was panting and trembling.Then she looked at the Black Water Fury in front of her.Then she calmly composed herself.\u201cIn that case.\u201cYou and I, and Yuqing, all three of us, have the diary, is that right?.\u201d\u201cThe contents of the diary can be spoken of within this space, and this space is made from your \u2018soul book\u2019.\u201d\u201cAs for the Soul Book, it is a spiritual art that you acquired after you were resurrected by the Patriarch, Is that right?\u201dWhen Ding Nanrong finished speaking overall summary she heard, the Black Water Fury affirmed back.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThen, without any concealment, the Black Water Fury stated her purpose.\u201cThe reason for summoning you here.\u201d\u201cIt is to ask you to do this God a favor, to convince that son of a bitch to let this God stay in the Wuyou Sect!\u201d\u201cBecause, this God does not want to go back to Ling Aotian\u2019s side!\u201dStay here?Not going back to Ling Aotian\u2019s side?Ding Nanrong recalled the contents of the diary for a little while, and then she probably guessed the reason.So she asked. \u201cAre you trying to change \u2026. the end of self-sacrifice and make Ling Aotian happy?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Black Water Fury\u2019s expression and voice were brimming with resentment.\u201cWhy should this God sacrifice myself to help fulfill Ling Aotian? This God\u2019s fate is up to this God!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDing Nanrong remained silent.If it were her, she also wouldn\u2019t be able to follow the original plot.So here is the question.Black Water Fury was the third female lead and was Ling Aotian\u2019s master.If she didn\u2019t go back, It would definitely have an irreversible impact on the plot.It might even affect her Ding Nanrong\u2019s happy and fulfilling ending.After some deliberation, Ding Nanrong said bluntly.\u201cI suggest you go back.\u201d\u201cNot a chance!\u201dThe Black Water Fury gritted her teeth and said low voice.\u201cI might as well tell you this.\u201d\u201cThis god has become that bastard\u2019s loyal slave. The sort who would give one\u2019s life for their master.\u201d\u201cIn other words, that son of a bitch is the closest and most important person to this God in this world.\u201d\u201cAnd you are his future daoist partner, and Han Yuqing is \u2026.\u201dShe glanced at Han Yuqing, who was still \u201cho-ho\u201d panting and trembling, and continued to gnash her teeth.\u201cAnd Han Yuqing is his wife, so, you two are also the closest people to this God.\u201d\u201cYou guys don\u2019t want this god to end up so miserable either, do you?\u201dThe fact that she was Jiang Mu\u2019s slave would sooner or later be known to the two of them.It would be better to say it out loud and openly.What\u2019s more. If she wanted to stay, she would need to get on good terms with the two of them and let them help find a way to convince Jiang Mu.Ding Nanrong frowned slightly after hearing this.Her intuition told her that Jiang Mu would definitely have the Black Water Fury go back.After thinking about it.She decided to excuse herself and stay out of this matter.So she said without hesitation.\u201cI can\u2019t help you, don\u2019t look for me.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d The Black Water Fury\u2019s eyes were glaring, and you can see the fire in her eyes.Then calming down eyes flashed as she thought of a brilliant idea, and she said in a softer, tempting tone.\u201cYou know that this God is a Demon God realm, right?\u201d\u201cThat is the pinnacle of existence in the Cangling Spirit Realm!\u201d\u201cAs long as you succeed in keeping this god by the bastard\u2019s side.\u201d\u201cThen you will be the best sister of this God!\u201d\u201cFrom now on, this God will guide you in your cultivation, so that you will take the road less traveled and take you in the right direction!\u201d\u201cAnd not to mention, this God will also grant you three requests within the limits of my ability!\u201d\u201cHow about that?\u201dShe smiled and tempted Ding Nanrong like she was tempting a child with a lollipop gourd candy.I believe that as long as one has a normal brain.Wouldn\u2019t even dare to refuse delicious offer!However\u2026\u201cNot interested.\u201d\u201cYou!!!\u201dHowever, Ding Nanrong is far from a person with normal brain. After all, she has gone as far as to become a servant for years to her hated enemy (In her mind) of \u201cJiang Mu\u201d.Black Water Fury was stunned and thought, she was a stupid person with big breasts and no brain, right!Black Water Fury was so furious that she wanted to go up and rub Ding Nanrong\u2019s B**bs..At that moment.\u201cHo! Ho! Ho\u2026!!!\u201dAnother high-pitched and long cries of groan startled them.Turning their eyes to look.They saw that Han Yuqing had fallen limply to the ground, shivering.\u201cYou guys are finally done with your shameless act!\u201dBlack Water Fury happily and hurriedly came to crouch down next to Han Yuqing.Since Ding Nanrong wouldn\u2019t help, the only way to do so was to put her hopes on Han Yuqing!She tempted with same words.\u201cYou do this god a favour ..\u201dShe repeated what she had just said to Ding Nanrong.After Han Yuqing listened dizzily, her two eyes instantly shone brightly.\u201cWhat you said is true? You will do what you can \u2026. Promise me three demands?\u201d\u201cOf course! This god only kills people, not cheats!\u201dThe Black Water Fury smirked, her chest full of conviction.Looking at Han Yuqing\u2019s reaction, she knew that Han Yuqing fell for her bait and would definitely help her.\u201cI\u2019ll help you!\u201dHan Yuqing seemed to be afraid that the Black Water Fury would back out and immediately agreed to her request.This was the Demon God realm cultivator!An existence at the peak of the Cangling Spirit Realm!Even if it was only the state of a soul and its strength was only at the Void Practitioner realm.But that was still a tremendous strength!In the future, she would have more power when she assaulted the Xuanyang Sect!Han Yuqing was very excited in her heart.Even more excited than intercourse with Jiang Mu\u2026.!\u201cIs it as long as I convince my husband to let you stay in the Wuyou Sect, that\u2019s it right?\u201dShe excitedly confirmed it once more.Black Water Fury smiled and emphasized once more.\u201cBut \u2026. But \u2026.\u201dHan Yuqing who gradually calmed down.She suddenly remembered one thing.Jiang Mu was intended to follow the original plot.And Jiang Mu hate her.So would she able to succeed in convincing him?Han Yuqing\u2019s brow furrowed.Out of the corner of her eye, she suddenly saw Ding Nanrong, who was standing naked at one side.\u201cHuh? Sister Rong? Why are you here too?\u201dDing Nanrong pointed at Black Water Fury and said indifferently.\u201cI was summoned in by her as well.\u201dHan Yuqing asked curiously, \u201cThen you also know about the diary ..\u201dDing Nanrong nodded her head, indicating that she already knew everything.\u201cSister Rong!\u201dHan Yuqing came next to Ding Nanrong and wrapped her naked body in a hug.\u201cWill you work with me to convince Husband to let her stay?\u201dShe said and rubbed a few times.\u201cI\u2019ve already refused, I won\u2019t get involved.\u201dDing Nanrong let Han Yuring hold her, and remained indifferent.\u201cHuh?\u201dHan Yuqing showed a look of disappointment.She didn\u2019t have full confidence that she could make Jiang Mu stay the Black Water Fury if she was on her own.What\u2019s to be done?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How about letting her talk to Husband too \u2026.\u201dHan Yuqing had a flash of light and came up with a good idea, a simple and crude solution.So she came in front of Black Water Fury and bent down.Scanning up and down her lovely face, golden pupils, petite body, sickly white skin, and slightly pointed horns.Muttering to herself.\u201cHmmm\u2026 Too small, not even enough for Husband to twist two fingers.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s quite cute looking.\u201d\u201cThe large golden pupils \u2026. expression should be a new source of interest to the husband.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! You\u2019re a snake, show me your tongue!\u201dAs if she thought of something funny, Han Yuqing urged and told the Black Water Fury to stick out her tongue.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this god\u2019s tongue?\u201dThe Black Water Fury was uncertain.But knowing that the other party was thinking of a way out for her, she obediently opened her little mouth.A long, forked tongue came out and curled around in the air.\u201cWow~ It\u2019s so long! It\u2019s still forked!\u201dHan Yuqing\u2019s eyes were starry.Looking at the forked tongue, which was as long as an arm, was like looking at a precious treasure.She excitedly leaned close to Black Water Fury\u2019s ear and whispered something\u2026After hearing this, Black Water Fury\u2019s mind went \u201cbuzz!\u201d It went blank for an instant.\u201cYou actually \u2026. want this god \u2026. to do that to him \u2026. And use my tongue \u2026.?\u201dShe was so astonished by hearing that she couldn\u2019t even speak, and her face was as wonderful as it could be.Han Yuqing smiled and said.\u201cI\u2019m saying this from my experience sister, husband can\u2019t resist this, you have to use this advantage, hehehe.\u201d\u201c\u2026. No \u2026. No way!!!\u201dBlackwater Fury\u2019s chest rose and fell in anger and nervousness, directly rejecting this Indecent proposal.She was the Lord of the Black Water territory and the leader of the Black Water Snake Clan.More so, she was a Demon God of her generation!She was an existence at the pinnacle of the Cangling Realm!Now she was asked to do such immoral things to a human \u2026.. And use her tongue \u2026.?What a shame! Pervert! Disgusting!!! Yuck-!!!\u201cDon\u2019t be in a hurry to reject it yet.\u201dHan Yuqing gave her a slightly meaningful look.Then she said in a methodical analysis.\u201cMen are all a very possessive species.\u201d\u201cIf you became husband\u2019s woman, then do you think husband, would he still let you return to Ling Aotian\u2019s side?\u201d\u201cAnd as a woman, we have a natural advantage.\u201d\u201cIn this world where the strongest are the most important, we have to know how to use our advantages to get more benefits!\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you in the Demon God realm? Aren\u2019t you standing at the top of the world?\u201d\u201cThen you can satisfy Husband\u2019s sense of conquest!\u201d\u201cAnd you are able to transform into a half-snake, half-human, right? You can also summon all kinds of snakes, can\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThen you can satisfy my husband\u2019s sense of curiosity!\u201d\u201cYou have so many advantages that when the time comes, you might not even be able to run away later even if you wanted to, Heheheh.\u201dHearing Han Yuqing finish her points with a mischievous laugh.The Black Water Fury\u2019s face turned extremely gloomy.The strong were respected, and the strong preyed on the weak.This kind of truth was something she had already experienced profoundly in the Blackwater territory.But nevertheless, there was a feeling that \u2026. Han Yuqing\u2019s words \u2026. Something was wrong?Blackwater Fury racked her brain.A key point eventually came to mind.\u201cHow do you guarantee that if this God and that son of a bitch do that\u2026. After that, he will absolutely let this god stay?\u201d\u201cHey, hey, you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201dHan Yuqing said confidently with her hands behind her back with a smug look.\u201cIt\u2019s simple, If your purpose is not achieved, if you don\u2019t gain enough benefits.\u201d\u201cThen there is only one reason.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s that the price you pay, isn\u2019t enough.\u201d????Meaning, I have to keep doing that son of a bitch \u2026..?The Black Water Fury\u2019s face instantly hardened.What the hell kind of solution is that, only a pervert like you could think of that, right?!Is this the character of a human being?!Indecent, she has no moral!The Black Water Fury felt her chest tightening.It was as if there was a breath being held inside her, unable to let it out.She didn\u2019t know if this \u2026.. approach, whether it would work or not.Because she didn\u2019t understand that kind of thing about humans.Nor had she ever thought that she would one day be with a man \u2026.\u201cOops, Little Fury, you can\u2019t hesitate now.\u201dWhen Han Yuqing saw that Black Water Fury was torn for some time, she persuaded her in a bitter voice.\u201cThe day after tomorrow, is the opening day of the Voice of Daylight Ruins.\u201d\u201cWhen that time comes, Ling Aotian will attend, and you\u2019ll have to go back to his side!\u201d\u201cIn other words, you only have one day tomorrow at most!\u201d\u201cTime waits for no one!\u201dOnly one day?!! Black Water Fury suddenly panicked in her heart, and her face was so gloomy.In fact, after listening to Han Yuqing\u2019s ridiculous plan just now.Instead, she suddenly thought of a more suitable method.That was to use the forbidden art of \u2018Serpent God Jidai\u2019 to create a permanent puppet to replace herself to return to Ling Aotian\u2019s side.It was just that this forbidden art needed to be performed in the Snake God\u2019s Tomb in the Black Water territory.So, first thought she could first follow what Han Yuqing had said and talk to Jiang Mu \u2026. to buy time to stay by his side.Later, she would return to Black Water territory herself and use the \u2018Serpent God Jidai\u2019 to create the puppet again.But she surprisingly forgot that the day after \u2026. was the day when the Voice of Daylight was to be held!And to get back and forth to Black Water territory, even if she kept using spatial spirit techniques to hurry, it would take at least a few days!It would be too late!Could it be that \u2026.I really have to go back to Ling Aotian\u2019s side\u2026.***The next day, early in the morning.Jiang Mu woke up from the fragrant scent.Looking around the red wedding room, he then looked at Han Yuqing, who was sleeping beside him.A deep sigh was let out.\u201cSigh, It\u2019s cold.\u201dHe came to the table and sat down, frantically pouring water to drink.Gulp, gulp, gulp!Thud!The cup rested heavily on the table.\u201cShit!\u201d\u201cAccording to the original plot.\u201d\u201cMy first time should have been for Ding Nanrong!\u201d\u201cAnd now?\u201dHe glanced back at Han Yuqing, who was sleeping in peace.\u201cIt turned out to be taken away by this pervert!\u201d\u201cShe used Void Divine Concealment to hide, seriously. Cunning and fierce as ever!\u201d\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the fact that my waist was strengthened, it would have been ruined!\u201dThe feeling of helplessness hit him hard.Drank a few more glasses of water in quick succession.Only then did he slowly adjust.\u201cI still haven\u2019t dealt with the Black water Fury for going unauthorized action last night.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already tired from last night.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s write today\u2019s diary first and see what rewards are there\u2019ll be.\u201d\u201cF*ck.\u201dCursing, he summoned his diary.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She\u2019s having nightmares.\u201d\u201cIt was a dream about childhood and being chased and abused by her mother.\u201dJiang Mu came to the side of the bed, picked up the quilt, and shook it.Then he put the side without dried blood over her fair, yet scarred body, and covered it gently.\u201cShall I write about her?\u201dLooking at Han Yuqing, whose brow was wrinkled in a depressed frown.Jiang Mu suddenly wanted to write about her.So he returned to the table and continued to write.\u3010Han Yuqing was dreaming.\u3011\u3010She said \u2018Mother, don\u2019t hit me.\u2019\u3011\u3010Apparently, she had nightmares about her childhood scenes of being abused and beaten by her mother.\u3011\u3010If we followed the original plot, this would have happened to her in the middle to late stages.\u3011\u3010And it was only in the middle to late stages that I slowly changed my attitude towards her.\u3011\u3010After that, I began to pity her, to accept her, to empathize with her.\u3011\u3010And finally.

How do you expect Ling Aotian to participate with such an injury?\u3011\u3010This bitch is giving me trouble.\u3011\u3010I\u2019ll punish her severely later!\u3011\u3010After that, order her to return to Ling Aotian\u2019s side!\u3011\u3010Let her live in harmony with Ling Aotian!\u3011\u3010No more beating up Ling Aotian!\u3011\u3010No more running around and causing trouble to everyone\u3011Inside the Sect, next door beside bridal chamber.\u201cSon of a bitch!!!\u201d\u201cYou really do want this god to go back!!!\u201dThe Black Water Fury stared at the diary with a deadly grip, his teeth gritted to a \u2018gnashing\u2019 sound.In her heart, she was hating and fearing at the same time.If she really went back to Ling Aotian\u2019s side and followed the plot completely.Then she probably wouldn\u2019t have the chance to return to the Snake God\u2019s Tomb in the Black Water Territory.There would be no way to make a puppet either.And the end of her self-sacrifice to become strength of Ling Aotian.It would also be impossible to change!\u201cThis God is not willing!!!\u201dThe Black Water Fury tried desperately to suppress the raging spiritual energy within her body.She looked sharply at the next door, which was Jiang Mu and Han Yuqing\u2019s bridal room.In her mind, thinking back to what Han Yuqing had told her last night about the approach.\u3010Men are all highly possessive species.\u3011\u3010If you became Husband\u2019s woman, then do you think Husband, would he still let you return to Ling Aotian\u2019s side?\u3011\u201cSince it has come to this!\u201d\u201cThen this god has no choice but to try!\u201dTime was too limited, and the Black Water Fury had no choice.In fact, after a night of deep thought.She rather felt that these shameful matters were no big deal.\u201cAnyway, this body that this God currently is just an ordinary water snake.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s this god\u2019s real physical body.\u201d\u201cSo, It\u2019s not a loss for this God to be broken!\u201d\u201cSince I only have one day today.\u201d\u201cThen let you son of a bitch have all day \u2026.\u201dThe Black Water Fury revealed a dark and vicious smile.At the same time, spreading her divine sense, she spied out the status of Jiang Mu\u2019s side at every moment.Intending to go over when Jiang Mu was all alone\u2026\u3010That\u2019s all for today\u3011.Finished writing.Jiang Mu closed his diary.Silently waiting for today\u2019s reward.\u3010Ding! Congratulations to the host, successful diary writing.\u3011\u3010Temperament +2 (22/100)\u3011\u3010Face Value +2 (22/100)\u3011\u3010Reward obtained: Extreme Flash (Immortal Technique)\u3011\u3010Reward Description: Master\u2019s trace all over the world. Can teleport to any place.\u3011\u3010Note: The place you wish to teleport to must have been seen with your own eyes\u3011\u3010Note: Limited to two uses per day.\u3011\u201cAnother immortal technique?\u201d\u201cExtreme Flash \u2026.\u201dLooking at reward introduction and restrictions.Jiang Mu thought that this immortal art wasn\u2019t as good as some spirit arts for attacking.\u201cIt\u2019s not right either, this Extreme Flash is equivalent to a Return to City skill, or an Escape skill.\u201d\u201cJust like last night.\u201d\u201cIf I had this skill, then I wouldn\u2019t have been forced by Han Yuqing.\u201d\u201cShit, This Damn immortal technique, not coming sooner!\u201dJiang Mu was irritated. He thought that the dog system was definitely playing with his emotions.These diary rewards.Either they were useless, or they were all the post-horse kind.\u201cHusband!\u201d Han Yuqing\u2019s happy voice suddenly came from behind him.Jiang Mu turned to look.He saw Han Yuqing lift the blanket and get out of bed, barefoot and naked.Then she limped in and came in front of Jiang Mu.And hugging him, she said pitifully.\u201cHusband, I can\u2019t stand still, crying~\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFeeling Han Yuqing, who was covered in scars and bumps. Jiang Mu didn\u2019t feel disgusted or anything.After all, it had been seventy rounds, so he had already gotten used to it.What\u2019s more, the two of them now are in reality a married couple.Then, according to the original plot\u2019s approach, and the villain\u2019s persona, he was already slowly starting to accept her.And she was gradually gaining more power and starting to develop the Wuyou Sect.Jiang Mu sighed.\u201cYou can go to my chambers later, take my token and take over all the internal affairs of the Wuyou Sect.\u201d\u201c!!! O-okay! Thank you, Husband!\u201dHan Yuqing happily gave Jiang Mu a kiss.Then, excitedly, she limped towards the door of her room.\u201cWait!\u201d Jiang Mu called out to her.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Husband? Oh, I see, Husband want to again \u2026.\u201dHan Yuqing licked her lips and smiled as she was about to pounce on him.\u201cAgain my ass!\u201d Jiang Mu scolded her.Then jumped upwards and pulled the jacket off the ceiling throwing it to Han Yuqing.\u201cHusband is so nice!\u201dHan Yuqing finished putting it on after rustling around in front of him.She gave Jiang Mu another kiss and Jiang Mu didn\u2019t resist but accepted.Only then did she finally open the door impatiently and limp towards the bedchamber next door.And just as Han Yuqing had left.Behind Jiang Mu, a spatial ripple was created.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Master \u2026. Master \u2026.\u201dShe fought back her discomfort and stumbled over her words, already cursing in her heart.Shame! Shameful!!! I want to kill someone so badly, aahh!!!But in order to stay here and change her miserable fate, she had no choice. Yes, it can\u2019t be helped.So she said the line she has been practicing from for a while now, with great difficulty.\u201cLast night \u2026.What\u2026. You and \u2026. Han Yuqing \u2026.did This god \u2026. also\u2026 Want to\u2026\u201d????What the fuck do you think!Shit, what\u2019s wrong with her!Jiang Mu\u2019s eyes glared at her like his parent killer.Although the Black Water Fury had become his slave and would not harm him, and would obey his orders absolutely.But if he didn\u2019t open his mouth to give the command, he could at best only slowly influence her with his soul, and could not actually command her efficiently, and obviously that the Black Water Fury knew this too.That was why his mouth was sealed by her, but it couldn\u2019t be sealed for long.So\u2026Tear rr-!She tore her black dress decisively in front of Jiang Mu.Crap Nima!!!Jiang Mu felt his scalp tingle.There was even a moment when his mind was blank.He couldn\u2019t even imagine that Black Water Fury would act in such a complete opposite of her character.But the next series of actions of the Black Water Fury.He almost died on the spot.She came up to him and grabbed his belt with her small hands\u2026Hiss-la-!!!The robe \u2026. Hissing -!!!An inner vesr\u2026 Hiss-!Shirt \u2026. Hissing-!Bottom\u2026. HISS-!!!The final truth \u2026. Hissing and Hissing \u2013 !!!What\u2019s she up to\u2026What is going on and why is she acting like this\u2026The pupils of Jiang Mu were already undergoing an 18 magnitude earthquake.His mind buzzed and he just watched in disbelief as Black Water Fury jumped on top of him.Her cool, moist little mouth, against his.Nervously and rawly, she imprinted \u2026.\u2026Inside the Next door beside the Patriarch\u2019s Hall bedchamber.Han Yuqing had gone through all the drawers and treasure chests, all of them.At last, before grabbing a dusty token at the bottom of the bed.\u201cIt\u2019s the internal affairs order of the Wuyou Sect!\u201dHan Yuqing wiped the token carefully as if it were a treasure, revealing a joyful smile.\u201cNow I\u2019ve successfully taken charge of the internal affairs of the Wuyou Sect.\u201d\u201cNext is as long as I get pregnant with Jiang Mu\u2019s child.\u201d\u201cThen, the entire Wuyou Sect will be mine, alone. Hehehe.\u201dShe triumphantly threw the token into her Space Ring.Then limped out of the bedchamber.Intending to go to the council hall, summon the senior members of the Wuyou Sect, and announce her authority.As she was passing by her own wedding room, she suddenly remembered a promise with, Little Fury to help her last night, and she hadn\u2019t talked to her Husband at all.\u201cThen let\u2019s go in and beg my husband to let him keep the Little Fury.\u201dSo she pushed the door open and was just about to head in.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe image of \u2018Sloths biting at each other and twin snakes playing with dragon\u2019 in the room made her freeze for a moment. (TL: did she have snake tentacles summoning or what? Did she turn her hand into a snake.?)\u201cThe little Fury is moving really fast.\u201dSo she quietly exited, but just as she was about to close the door.She suddenly thought of something interesting and a mischievous smile appeared on her face.\u201cHehehe. Let me, senior sister, help you, little Fury.\u201dVoid Divine Concealment!She used her stealth technique and submerged her body into the void.After a while, Jiang Mu then felt a familiar stirring.For some reason, he remembered Han Yuqing, who had burrowed under the covers last night.And that made his head, too, clear up a little.Looking at Black Water Fury\u2019s face that was close to him, Jiang Mu\u2019s mind was frantically trying to think of a way to get out of this crisis.Right! Why did I forget the \u2018Extreme Flash\u2019!Jiang Mu then remembered the reward he had just received for writing his diary: the Extreme Flash.That was the one that could teleport to any place!So where should I teleport to?Whatever, I could teleport twice a day anyway.The first priority was to get away before the bitch took the opportunity to enter.I got it. That\u2019s It, the cave in the Demon Beast Mountain Range!Extreme Flash -!Jiang Mu\u2019s thoughts turned and he cast an immortal technique and the very next moment.A flash of light flickered.Jiang Mu and Black Water Fury\u2019s bodies disappeared from the bridal chamber with the flash of light.Tens of thousands of miles away.A certain cave in the Demon Beast Mountain Range.A light shone out of thin air, illuminating the barbecue grill and beast bones on the ground.Then, a bare-bodied, barefooted man and a long, black haired little loli on top of him.Together, they appeared inside the cave.Jiang Mu: \u201c????\u201dBlack Water Fury: \u201c????\u201dHan Yuqing, who was invisible and kneeling on the ground with her cheeks bulging out: \u201c???\u201dDamn it!!!This extreme flash\u2026 Can it bring someone else along with you to teleport?Looking at the Black Water Fury hanging on his body, Jiang Mu resigned in his heart.It\u2019s the end \u2026. It\u2019s over \u2026..I don\u2019t know how to continue this stupid Novel \u2026..F**k It! Come on baby!***Two hours later.\u201cHiss! Hiss! \u2026. Hiss yah-!!!\u201dA long, high-pitched, hoarse cry, interspersed with fluttering spiritual pressure, shook a flock of birds and beasts to death outside the cave.The entire Black Water Fury fell limply on top of Jiang Mu.The rest of the trembling did not stop.On the side, Han Yuqing took out a robe from the Space Ring.Smilingly, she covered the two Jiang Mu and Little Fury bodies.\u201cHusband, I\u2019ll roast a beast for you to replenish your stamina, you have to rest for a while before you can continue.\u201dThen she glanced at Black Water Fury and gave her a wink of \u2018Continue on\u2019.Then she came to the cave and took out the grilling utensils and the beast whip from the Space Ring. Getting busy.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFeeling the little loli in his arms, the corners of Jiang Mu\u2019s mouth twitched.A villain, hooking up with the third female lead.Well, all in all. The Black Water Fury, the heroine\u2019s persona, Story. All destroyed!Completely, Utterly destroyed!Ugh\u2026..I feel like a clown. The dog system has left me with nothing.After contemplating for a long time.Jiang Mu only asked for the Black Water Fury in his arms.\u201cTell me, why did you do this.\u201dHis mind was in a complete state of chaos right now.He didn\u2019t know how to proceed with the plot anymore.The Black Water Fury had long expected Jiang Mu to ask this, so she replied back reasonably with the answer she thought of.\u201cBecause this god is your slave, and my soul is deeply influenced by you.\u201d\u201cLast night, you and Han Yuqing \u2026.\u201cSo today, this God could not help but feel for you \u2026.\u201d\u201cThis is an urge that originates from the depths of my soul, and this God cannot control it and now \u2026.\u201d Said as she stopped midway.She raised her head, a pair of golden pupils looking fixedly at Jiang Mu, and said decisively.\u201cNow, this god has \u2026. I can\u2019t leave you anymore!\u201d????Can\u2019t leave me?The Black Water Soul Etching Technique\u2026 Was there such a function?Jiang Mu had a suspicious look on his face, but he didn\u2019t have the evidence to prove it.After all, he was the master, and she was the servant. He couldn\u2019t change his position to experience it.So here is the question.Now Black Water Fury couldn\u2019t leave him.So how else could she go back to Ling Aotian\u2019s side?Even if she could go back, she has now become Jiang Mu\u2019s woman \u2026.Ha, this plot.Interesting.So funny, Hahahahaha.F*ck!\u201cMaster\u2026 Master\u2026\u201d\u201c?\u201dTwo hours later.\u201cHiss! Hiss! \u2026. Hiss yah-!!!\u201dTwo hours later.\u201cHiss yah-!!!\u201dTwo hours later.\u201cYah-!!!\u201dTwo hours later \u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Anymore.\u201dThe words of affection came out of her mouth, but she secretly cursed inside her heart.Bastard! Even after a day, you\u2019re still live!!!Then, weakly, she passed out on him.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cReally. She\u2019s so worthy of the Blackwater Serpents.\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019m so worthy of \u2026 Goodly waist.\u201dJiang Mu twisted his waist, feeling that his blue bar had only been depleted by a small amount.He wrapped the Blackwater Siren into his arms so that he could cover her naked body with his robe.Looking at her, exhausted, resigned, determined, and tinged with the slightest hint of fear, couldn\u2019t help but sigh deeply.\u201cUgh, The hell is going on with plot, It\u2019s a mess .\u201d\u201cThe fact that she \u2018The female protagonist\u2019 can\u2019t even leave me now.\u201d\u201cShould I just screw around and let loose to have a blast with this last reincarnation? F*ck.\u201dJiang Mu felt more mentally exhausted than ever.If Black Water Fury\u2019s persona was just little crooked, he could still try to remedy it.But her original persona had completely gone to hell.As the third female lead, she had become his villain\u2019s slave and woman, both in mind and body, and couldn\u2019t live without him.In other words, she wouldn\u2019t even think about returning to Ling Aotian\u2019s side from the bottom of her heart.Moreover, it was impossible for him to order her to go back.There\u2019s no man who\u2019d ask his women to go with another man, and Jiang Mu\u2019s quite possessive.So here comes the problem.How else will Ling Aotian be going through the plot without his master?More importantly, how the hell was he\u2019s supposed to pass?\u201cShit! Dog system, I don\u2019t believe it!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll get through this, I won\u2019t give up. There\u2019s nothing I cant do it. B*tch. f*ck you!!!\u201dJiang Mu cheered himself up as his competitive spirit became stirred up.In the previous seventy or so rounds, there was only one reward for passing the level: the ability to choose any one fictional character to bring back to the real world.But now, in this final round, the reward for passing was huge.Not only could he take the diary reward back with him but could also bring back Han Yuqing, Ding Nanrong, and Black Water Fury, the three women.In other words, as long as he got through, he would be a proper winner in life!\u201cGotta think of a surefire way.\u201d\u201cTo solve the problem of Ling Aotian not having a master.\u201dJiang Mu began to think hard about it.Tomorrow was the main storyline, the Voice of the Day Sun.Without the help of the Black Water Fury, Ling Aotian would probably be killed by the demonic beasts inside.\u201cWhat to do \u2026. What to do \u2026..\u201dAfter thinking about it for a while.Jiang Mu finally seemed to think of a more compromising solution.\u201cI\u2019ll take the Black Water Fury and secretly lurk near Ling Aotian to help him complete the plot?\u201d\u201cHmmm \u2026.Damn It, that\u2019s the only way left for now.\u201dAt that moment.Han Yuqing came in from the cave entrance carrying a dozen large bird beasts that she had hunted in her hand.\u201cHuh? Husband, are you guys finally done?\u201d\u201cNow that the beast whips are finished, I\u2019ll roast a few more birds for you to replenish your health. Hehehe.\u201dShe said as she was about to put the birds and animals on the grill to roast.\u201cNo need, let\u2019s go back.\u201dJiang Mu stopped her.The reason he had teleported here was to avoid the Black Water Fury, not to enjoy the barbecue.Since he had now been victimized by the Black Water Fury \u2026.. then there was no need for him to stay here overnight.\u201cGo back? How are we going to go back?\u201dHan Yuqing looked puzzled, only then did she remember.Earlier, when she was stealthy, moved inside under a blanket in his room and being poured out, next thing she knew, she was in this cave.So her eyes shone brightly and she asked Jiang Mu, full of curiosity.\u201cHusband! Do you possess some kind of powerful secret art of instantaneous movement?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s exact\u2013 \u2026. Cough.\u201dJiang Mu immediately shut up, almost revealing the reward of his diary.Ugh? Wait! The diary reward\u2026Han Yuqing\u2019s question did give Jiang Mu some clues.Could he use the diary reward \u2026. to solve the problem?So he opened his personal panel to see what rewards were more useful.[Body of pretending to be beaten][Goodly Waist][The Body That Bears All Poisons][Su Sheng of the Dead (Rules)][Celestial One Eye (Spiritual Arts)][Transformation Technique (Immortal Technique)][Art of Extreme Dao Shift (Immortal Technique)[Extreme Flash (Immortal Art)]Watching carefully.It was as if his mind had caught a glimpse of something, and as if he had caught nothing at all.Celestial One Eye \u2026. The Art of Transformation \u2026. The Art of Extreme Dao Shift \u2026. Extreme Flash \u2026.\u201cHusband, what are you thinking about?\u201dHan Yuqing came to sit down next to Jiang Mu and hugged his arm, looking like a curious baby.\u201cNothing, let\u2019s go back first.\u201dJiang Mu casually replied.He couldn\u2019t think of anything yet.So he turned his mind and cast an immortal technique.Extreme Flash!A flash of light appeared.The three of them then disappeared with the light, inside the cave.***The next day, early in the morning.The third floor of the Dark Night Building.Inside the spacious floor, there stood dozens of young men and women.They were chatting feverishly.It\u2019s because, today, was the day the Daylight Sound ruins opened!\u201cBrother Chen! I heard that there are many treasures inside the ruins! Treasures! Is this true?\u201d\u201cTrue.\u201d\u201cWow! Aren\u2019t we going to be rich then? We\u2019re going to go on a treasure hunt! Make a fortune! Do you want to earn it, Brother Chen?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious?\u201d\u201cBut the demon beasts inside are all very ferocious! I heard that they are demon soldiers under some demon army general! Do you know about this?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cI also heard that! The ruins are actually the border city of a fallen kingdom! It was occupied by that demon army general! Are you afraid, Brother Chen?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid! It\u2019s none of our business anyway! I just want to get rich! Then I\u2019ll buy Xia Hua from Lihua Pavilion! Do you know Xia Hua, Brother Chen?\u201d\u201cWho.\u201d\u201cHahahaha! It\u2019s the one with the two rabbit girls! I tell you, she\u2019s a bomb. When we get out of the ruins! I\u2019ll take you to have a taste her! Guaranteed to be memorable for the rest of your life!\u201d\u201cOK!!!\u201d\u2026Ling Aotian couldn\u2019t even be bothered to listen to the fiery chatter of the next person.At this moment, he was extremely worried.This was because, his master, Black Water Fury, had not returned yet.Coupled with his broken left arm, he would be very unsafe inside the ruins.At this moment.A shout of alarm came from the crowd.\u201cIt\u2019s the Floor Master! The Floor Master has come down!\u201dThe eyes of the crowd looked towards the stairs in unison.They saw a beautiful blue-skirted woman with a graceful figure, stepping down the stairs with her long and slender jade feet.With each step, her mountain peaks sank, and rise, shaking.That spectacular sight made everyone drool.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The temple\u2019s name is commonly literally translated as Temple of the Soul\u2019s Retreat. It is one of the largest and wealthiest Buddhist temples in China, and contains numerous pagodas and Buddhist grottoes) (That\u2019s basic notes. In short, It\u2019s on top of mountain, first place morning sun falls and Very spiritual place.)Lingyin Kingdom?Wasn\u2019t that a small country that had already perished?Some people whispered to each other and discussed about the Lingyin Country.Lu Churou continued.\u201cThe Lingyin Kingdom, a human kingdom that was attacked and occupied by a demon army.\u201cInside, there are immeasurable treasures buried under the ruins of the city.\u201d\u201cExcept that the ruins are inhabited by all sorts of demonic beasts and there is only one thing for you to do.\u201d\u201cIt is to hunt all demonic beasts within the Lingyin Kingdom and drip their essence blood into the \u2018Sound of Day and Sun\u2019 token in order to record the information of the demonic beasts, and eventually hand the token over to the Dark Night House.\u201d\u201cAs long as you collect enough information about the demonic beasts, not only will the Dark Night House not share the treasures you have obtained, it will even give you additional rewards.\u201dWowwww!!!Lu Churou\u2019s words made the crowd feel exhilarated.Dark Night House, how generous!They all knew that the Dark Night House\u2019s main business was selling demon beast information to the major sects and cities.Now, for the sake of the demon beast information source, not only did the Dark Night House not take their treasures, it even gave them a reward?This is called a pattern!Only after the crowd\u2019s excitement had passed did Lu Churou continue.\u201cAs this is your first time participating, you are inexperienced and your cultivation levels are not high.\u201d\u201cTherefore, I will be the person in charge of this expedition and personally lead you all in exploring the ruins of the Lingyin Kingdom.\u201d with that said.Suddenly she felt something in her heart.Did Jiang Mu update his diary?So she asked Juan\u2019er to explain some of the matters that followed.She herself then gracefully stepped aside.Called out the diary.

Master?Lu Chorou felt curious.She remembered that Black Water Fury was the third female master and was Ling Aotian\u2019s master.How come it was now with Jiang Mu \u2026. become a slave-master relationship?She couldn\u2019t help but take a quick glance at Ling Aotian, who was among the crowd below.She found him covering his left arm, which was wrapped in a white bandage, and listening to Juan\u2019er\u2019s speech with a worried expression on his face.Ling Aotian seemed to be born with the ability to sense the gaze of beauty.He suddenly turned his eyes to look and really found Lu Chorou looking at him.So the corners of his mouth were slightly hooked, and without making a sound, he held his head high, revealing a confident and charming smile.Yesterday, he had strolled around Xue City and found that wherever he went, there were a bunch of women who had their eye on him.This made him deeply realize that his own smile was so attractive to women.Now, as Juan\u2019er, who was speaking, saw this charming smile of his, her heart immediately jumped and she couldn\u2019t help but show her nympho face... So handsome \u2026.And Lu Churuo pretended not to see it and continued to read her diary.[I asked her why she was burrowing under the covers.][She said that as a loyal slave, she could no longer leave me and was afraid that I would drive her away, so she would regularly be drilled again in the future.][That scared the hell out of me.][To be honest, I could no longer be separated from her either.][One of the reasons, if I may, is her tongue, which is really long and forked.]\u201cSon of a bitch! You think this god wants it?!\u201dBlack Water Fury cursed in the bathroom, gargling as she did so.\u201cGrrrrrr~ But had to say Han Yuqing\u2019s method really worked.\u201d\u201cThat bastard\u2019s possessiveness and curiosity are really strong.\u201d\u201cNow, this god\u2019s plan is successful, at least that bastard, for the time being, won\u2019t order me back to Ling Aotian\u2019s side.\u201d\u201cNext, this God will find an opportunity to return to the Black Water Jedi and enter the Ancient Tomb of the Serpent God.\u201d\u201cThen create a puppet in order to replace myself as Ling Aotian\u2019s master.\u201d\u201cAt that time, this God will then look for an opportunity to retake the physical body and replace this dirty snake body now.\u201d\u201cThe most important thing is that this God can avoid my self-sacrificing end!\u201d\u201cGrrrrr!\u201d[Estimating the time.][Right now Lu Churou, the second female lead, should be about to open Sound of Day and Sun\u2019s Ruins teleportation gate][She will lead Ling Aotian and the others to enter the ruined city of the Lingyin Kingdom and carry out a hunt of demonic beasts.][And Lihua, the fourth heroine, had already disguised herself as a female cultivator to blend in with the crowd in order to investigate Ling Aotian, to conveniently approach him in the ruins.][In other words, this story of Voice of the Day Sun will involve and focus on the two female leads, Lu Churou and Lihua.][After that well, one can even guess without using brain cells that horned dog Ling Aotian fall in love deeper and will develop a relationship with these two female leads clearly]\u201cDevelop a relationship?\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t intend to get close to Ling Aotian.\u201dLihua held her chin and stared at the diary with interest.After she returned to the Lihua Pavilion from the Wuyou Sect that night, she hadn\u2019t left the house again.Even less, did she send someone to invite Ling Aotian.\u201cSuppose If I didn\u2019t know about Ling Aotian\u2019s information and the Black Water Fury.\u201d\u201cThen I would have really approached Ling Aotian in disguise.\u201d\u201cBut now I already know it all and What? the Black Water Fury has actually become Jiang Mu\u2019s slave? And can\u2019t be separated at all?\u201d\u201cThen wouldn\u2019t the target I have to approach become Jiang Mu?\u201d\u201cAfter all, I\u2019ll have to lure the Black Water Fury to the place designated by Shahe.\u201d\u201cHow interesting.\u201d[Oh yeah, and Black Water Fury, she\u2019s going to play a huge role in this main storyline.][But she\u2019s already on my side.][So to make sure the outcome of the plot doesn\u2019t deviate, the only thing I can do at the moment is to sneak into this event and secretly help Ling Aotian from the shadows.][Damn it, originally, this crappy plot has nothing for me to do.][Now I\u2019m forced to involve myself! F*ck.]\u201cIn that case, Jiang Mu will also participate?\u201dLihua\u2019s eyes twinkled as an interesting thought occurred to her.\u201cHow about \u2026.I just disguise myself and go in and have some fun with Jiang Mu?\u201d[As for Xue Menghan, the 1st female lead, she went on a trip to the Changyu Empire with Xue Yuanshan yesterday, so she\u2019ll be absent from this event][Well, that\u2019s probably it for today.]Finished writing.Jiang Mu closed his diary.[Ding! Congratulations to the host, successful diary writing.]The system\u2019s reward voice just sounded.He saw Black Water Fury walking out of the bathroom.She had a bad complexion and looked like she had eaten something uncomfortable.\u201cLittle cutie, come here quickly.\u201dJiang Mu hurriedly waved at her.Since the word \u2018Fury\u2019 was too vicious and domineering, he simply called her Little Cutie.With an ashen face, Black Water Fury obediently came in front of him.Jiang Mu raised his left hand and wore a Fine Space Ring on his middle finger.It was the one Xue Yuanshan had bribed for Ling Aotian by pleading for him earlier.\u201cIn the future, you can stay inside this Ring, go inside.\u201dWithout saying a word, the Black Water Fury directly transformed into a black mist and drilled into the ring.Jiang Mu pondered for a moment.\u201cThe Sound of Day and Sun is about to open, I have to hurry and say hello to Ding Nanrong and Han Yuqing before I leave.\u201dIn the original plot, he was inside the sect, watching over Han Yuqing to keep her from messing around with the Wuyou Sect.But now that the plot had changed, he would be disappearing for a while.So it was necessary to say hello to the two girls.And so walked to the side door.Tuk.Tuk.Tuk.\u201cRong\u2019er, are you there.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dOnly when he got a response did Jiang Mu enter.Seeing Ding Nanrong sitting in front of the dressing table, her plain hand was running through something in the air.Jiang Mu didn\u2019t care, and only found a relatively reasonable excuse and said.\u201cThat \u2026. Rong\u2019er, I\u2019m going to Xue Cheng to hang out for a while.\u201dIt was a bit difficult to after all.This old maid was probably going to follow along.Jiang Mu was worried about that and because Ding Nanrong was his personal maid, she was almost inseparable from him.However\u2026\u201cBe safe.\u201d????Did she really agree? wasn\u2019t going to follow along?Jiang Mu was beyond surprised.Hmmm\u2026. Guess it was because of her crooked persona.Jiang Mu walked out of the room to Han Yuqing\u2019s room.Before he could knock on the door.Han Yuqing opened the door from inside and came out.As soon as she saw Jiang Mu.Her face first looked puzzled, then turned to one of surprise.\u201cHusband? Wow! Did you come to say good morning to me specifically! I\u2019m so happy!\u201dShe wrapped her arms around him and rained kisses on him.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJiang Mu pushed her away and admonished her.\u201cI\u2019ll be out for a bit of a while and until I come back, you have to take care of the internal affairs of the Wuyou Sect, all right?.\u201dHan Yuqing obediently stood and smiled back, saying.\u201cGot it, I\u2019ll definitely take care of the Wuyou Sect!\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dJiang Mu nodded his head.Before turning around and leaving.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jiang Mu\u2019s conscience was instantly plunged into darkness.Below his vision, a complete map of the Cangling Realm gradually emerged.He moved his vision all the way to the north.Finally. It settled on a devastated and ruined kingdom.\u201cLet\u2019s have a look at the Lingyin Kingdom first.\u201d\u201cThat way, it\u2019ll be convenient to instantaneously move around inside at will rather then choosing randomly.\u201dJiang Mu took his time, looking at almost every corner of the Lingyin Kingdom and memorizing it in his mind.After he finished it and before he found an abandoned ancient city, which was the entrance city of the replica.\u201cThere\u2019s no one in the city? That means they haven\u2019t teleported in yet.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll go ahead and wait.\u201d\u201cExtreme Flash!\u201d He turned his mind.The whole person then turned into a light and disappeared within the woods.Lingyin Kingdom.A certain ruined city on the border.A light shone out of thin air.Jiang Mu landed steadily on the ground from it.The hot wind, mixed with the fishy smell of demonic beasts. A stench hit his nose.It was so stuffy that it was a little hard for him to breathe.The surrounding broken houses and rotten walls were also distorted by the steamy air.\u201cIt has been more than seventy rounds, and this is the first time I\u2019ve participated in this event.\u201d\u201cNot alone but with the \u2018Heroine\u2019 Black Water Fury.why does it feel like I\u2019m the main character?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just so f*cked.\u201d Jiang grumbled speechlessly at the plot development.Then asked to Black water Fury.\u201cCutie, is the cold ice bed comfortable enough to sleep on?\u201d\u201cFumu \u2026. Not bad.\u201dFrom inside the Ring, Black Water Fury\u2019s lazy voice came out.At this moment, she was in the form of a human form with a snake tail, and was comfortably lying on the Ice-Cold special custom bed, that helps with recovery.This bed had been specially arranged for her by Jiang Mu to help her recover her soul power.Jiang Mu continued.\u201cHave a good rest, I\u2019ll call you if I need you later.\u201dAs this place was full of demonic beasts, and his own cultivation level was only Spirit Gathering Mirror.Therefore, it might be necessary to have the Black Water Fury come out to save him sometime.As he was thinking this.The huge city gate in the distance emitted an intense light, forming a swirling light gate.A beautiful blue-skirted woman with a graceful figure stepped out of the whirling light gate with long white legs.Her footsteps were elegantly under control, which was why those huge breasts did not create a violent shaking.\u201cThe size of this old witch must have reached the limit of human beings.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s almost catching up with Ding Nanrong.\u201dJiang Mu hid behind the crumbling wall and watched from afar from the shadows.Immediately afterwards, a group of male and female cultivators could be seen, one after another, coming out of the light door.After Lu Churuo said a few words to everyone.The crowd rushed frantically into the ancient city as if they had been hit by chicken blood.\u201cWell, the event has started.\u201dJiang Mu was ready to blend into the crowd so that he could get close to Ling Aotian and make sure that the plot outcome was restored.Suddenly, he thought of Lu Churou\u2019s persona.\u201cI guess her persona, too, has gone astray as well.\u201d\u201cIn the original plot, Ling Aotian would take the initiative to come up and talk to her.\u201d\u201cSince she admired Ling Aotian and was optimistic about his potential, she would give him a detailed account of the situation in the ancient city, as well as the distribution range of demonic beasts.\u201d\u201cAnd Ling Aotian would give a confident, charming smile and pull a handsome trick on her to brush up her feelings.\u201d\u201cAnd in the end, she did raise her favorable feelings.\u201dTo confirm whether Lu Churou\u2019s persona was crooked.Jiang Mu then focused his gaze on her and followed her every movement.And he didn\u2019t have to wait much, as he saw the result clearly, and it was.Ling Aotian, who was just about to go up and strike up a conversation with her when, as if on purpose, she simply turned around and left immediately, as if getting away from him.\u201cVery well, Lu Churou\u2019s persona is indeed crooked.\u201d\u201cHaha, then the Lihua who mixed in in disguise must have been crooked too.\u201d\u201cHmm? Isn\u2019t that Juan\u2019er? this female\u2026.Isn\u2019t she Lu Churou\u2019s servent? Crap!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing here, trying to get on top position before others?\u201dJiang Mu was surprised to see this.Lu Churou\u2019s maid, Juan\u2019er took the initiative to go up and talk to Ling Aotian?With a look of shyness.\u2026\u201cLing\u2026 Young Master Ling\u2026 You must\u2026 Be careful of the demonic beasts\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Miss Juan\u2019er, you\u2019ve informed me of the status of this ancient city and the demon beasts, I have nothing to fear! I will definitely be triumphant!\u201dLing Aotian finished his sentence with a confident smile.Juan\u2019er\u2019s heart was beating wildly. Her eyes were moistened, and blushing. All the way from ear to neck.\u2026\u201cWhat a guy!\u201d\u201cThis girl, her nymphomaniac face is actually so much natural and high level, so much so that she\u2019s already beaten Xue Menghan in compareson \u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not going to get involved with Ling Aotian, is she!\u201dJiang Mu had discovered something unbelievable.This Harem of the Martial Gods Book was purely clear water.Until the end, Ling Aotian was a virgin chicken.Not even holding a woman\u2019s hand, but now Juan\u2019er was such a nymphomaniac.I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not going to be given for nothing?\u201cWell, it seems that with the female protagonist\u2019s characters crooked persona will also cause the minor characters like her around them to be crooked as well?\u201d\u201cWhat a shit system!\u201dJiang Mu cursed on his side.Ling Aotian had already left in style amid Juan\u2019er\u2019s obsessed gaze.Meanwhile, there was a pure white skirt girl who was blatantly following Ling Aotian.This made Jiang Mu come into the spirit.\u201cLihua, is starting to make her move.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s going to take this opportunity to disguise herself as a young lady in her prime to approach and investigate Ling Aotian \u2026. Well, if only her persona is not crooked.\u201d\u201cBut no matter what, I\u2019ll have to follow up secretly.\u201dWith Jiang Mu\u2019s thoughts turned and cast an immortal technique.\u201cTransformation!\u201dPow! He turned from a handsome young man into a cute girl in a yellow-skirt.As for why he didn\u2019t turn into another man-like form?That was purely because he didn\u2019t want to.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m scared.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not going to drive me away, are you, Young Master Ling?\u201dshe said as she held a pair of small hands over her chest, showing a worried and frightened expression.\u201cHahaha! Don\u2019t worry, Miss Xiaohua,\u201dWith a dazzling and confident wave of his big hand, Ling Aotian laughed and said.\u201cAlthough I am handsome, I am not a shallow and thin-skinned person!\u201d\u201cAs for safety, Miss Xiaohua, doesn\u2019t need to worry.\u201d\u201cI will definitely keep you safe!\u201d\u201cHahahaha!\u201dHe was in a good mood, quite enjoying this feeling of being relied on by a beautiful girl.Sure enough, his own charm was really hard to resist for women, what a sinful man I am.Lihua smiled happily as she heard this.\u201cThen, thank you, Young Master Ling, you\u2019re kind!\u201dIs this male lead?You\u2019re not even as handsome as Jiang Mu.Lihua\u2019s impression of Ling Aotian, the male protagonist, could only be described as mediocre.After all, she had lived for four hundred years and had seen countless handsome young men.And the reason she wanted to be with Ling Aotian was because she knew that Jiang Mu would secretly follow Ling Aotian.She was purely curious as to how Jiang Mu would turn the plot around and correct it.Roar\u2013!There was a roar of a demonic beast and a miserable scream from up ahead.\u201cMiss Xiaohua! Someone might be hunting demonic beasts up ahead, let\u2019s go take a look!\u201dLing Aotian said, taking the lead and running over.Lihua followed closely.And behind the two of them, a cute young girl in a yellow dress was secretly following.\u201cWell, it\u2019s coming, Ling Aotian\u2019s Treasure Hunt storyline.\u201dJiang Mu, who had been transformed into a young girl, recalled the original plot.\u201cLing Aotian will go on a rampage, looting the treasured swords found by the other cultivators, and the demon cores they hunted.\u201d\u201cBut he underestimated his opponent, resulting in a failed loot.\u201d\u201cThen as he was about to borrow the power of the Black Water Fury.\u201d\u201cInstead, Lihua took the initiative to save him, which was only to gain his trust and facilitate the investigation of him.\u201d\u201cThis caused Ling Aotian to fall in love with Lihua as well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s when the so-called relationship line began to develop.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s probably about it.\u201dThe abandoned open square.Two male cultivators, were busy dismembering a dead two-headed wolf demon beast with their swords.\u201cWe\u2019re so lucky, not only did we found two treasured swords, but we also happened to encounter a weakened two-headed wolf.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because, this is only the border town of the Lingyin Kingdom, if we go further inside, the more powerful the demonic beasts will be.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but let\u2019s hope that this wolf will have a demon core, so we can make a small profit.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hope so \u2026. Hmm? It\u2019s a demon core! I got one! Hahahaha!\u201dOne of the cultivators, dug out an egg-sized, dark red demon core from inside the wolf\u2019s head.\u201cI got it too! Hahahaha!\u201dAnother cultivator, too, dug out a demon core from inside another wolf\u2019s head.The two of them were so happy that they let out a loud laugh.At that moment.Dang!A black shadow descended from the sky and landed behind the duo.\u201cWho\u2019s there!\u201dThe duo turned around in shock, wary of the black-robed youth in front of them.The youth was naturally Ling Aotian.He smiled wickedly and coldly, and said proudly.\u201cHand over the demon core, don\u2019t force me to use force.\u201dRob our treasure?The two looked at each other and both froze for a moment.They examined Ling Aotian.They found that his left hand was wrapped in a white bandage, so he was obviously injured.And the aura of spiritual power emanating from his body was only that of a Spirit Gathering Mirror.Such a half-cripple dared to rob them of the \u300eLightning Spirit Duo\u300f?Either he was retarded or \u2026. had something to rely on!They looked around nervously.Eventually, they saw that far behind Ling Aotian, there stood a young girl in a white dress.However, that young girl\u2019s aura was only that of a Spirit Gathering Mirror, and it looked like she did not intend on coming over to help Ling Aotian at all.This situation could make the two of them laugh.\u201cHehe, you want to rob us even if you\u2019re like this? Are you out of your mind?\u201d\u201cI think he must be, he has one Gathering Spirit Mirror to beat two of us, how dare he?\u201dThe duo jeered, carrying their swords step by step towards Ling Aotian.They intended to educate this brat who didn\u2019t know how high the sky was.Ling Aotian did not retreat in the slightest. He half-crouched, his right arm clenched into a fist, and smiled coldly.\u201cA mere two Spirit Gathering Mirrors, Laozi can defeat you with one hand!\u201d\u201c\u201dDon\u2019t you be cocky!!!\u201d\u201dThe two were enraged by his words and immediately burst out with their spiritual energy.With great speed, they dashed towards Ling Aotian.\u201cYou guys\u2026 W-why are you guys so fast!\u201dLing Aotian was suddenly stunned.But he had no time to think. The only thing he could do was gather his spiritual power, and his right fist gathered spiritual power and shot at the duo.Crackling clang clang clang!!!A few moments passed.\u201cLet go of me!!!\u201dLing Aotian was stomped on by the duo, his nose bruised, and his face swollen as he roared in rage.\u201cLet go of you? You who didn\u2019t even have any hair down there, how dare you come and rob us without asking about our \u300eLightning Spirit Duo\u300f? Huh?\u201dOne of the cultivators, spat on Ling Aotian.\u201cWhat?! You guys are actually the \u2026. \u300eLightning Spirit Duo\u300f!\u201dLing Aotian was shocked.He had thought that these two were just ordinary cultivators.But to his surprise, they are \u300eLightning Spirit Duo\u300f who were known for their speed!If Master Black Water Fury was around, even if they were faster and stronger, he, Ling Aotian, would definitely not be afraid!But the master had not returned.So, to get out of danger.He would either have to expose his last card: the prismatic crystal block in his heart.Either that, or Little Girl would come to his rescue.Turning back, Ling Aotian looked towards Xiaohua, who was standing in the distance.Instead, he found her looking around, not knowing what she was looking for.\u201cLing Aotian has been beaten down yet, so it\u2019s time for Jiang Mu to come out, right?\u201dCurious, Lihua pressed her palm against her forehead and looked around for Jiang Mu spreading her spiritual energy.It looked like she was completely unconcerned about the battle on Ling Aotian\u2019s side.Seeing this, Ling Aotian could only make up his mind in secret.There was no way out\u2026Only \u2026. Expose the Trump card!So he secretly activated the prismatic crystal block of his heart.\u2026\u201cDamn it, this Lihua, the hell are you looking around!\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see that Ling Aotian is being knocked down! Why don\u2019t you go and save him?\u201d\u201cIf you save him, you\u2019ll gain his trust! And he\u2019ll love you for it!\u201d\u201cAre you still investigating? Are you going to develop a love relationship or not? Fuck!\u201dJiang Mu, who was hiding behind the remnants of the wall, and secretly observing, cursed at Lihua with hatred.Although he had already predicted that Lihua was crooked as well.But when he himself saw it, he still couldn\u2019t help, but still cursed.After all, this was a direct result. Ling Aotian\u2019s treasure capture plot had flipped.And in this way.Without the help of the Black Water Fury, Ling Aotian would have to resort to using the \u2018source fragment\u2019 of his heart to turn defeat into victory.\u201cNo way!

Look here!\u201d Jiang Mu yelled softly in a cute voice as he ran forward.\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\uff1fEveryone turned to look at the voice.They saw a girl in a yellow skirt, empty-handed, rushing out from behind the debris.\u201cCould it be Jiang Mu?\u201dThat was Lihua was first suspicious.Given this current situation, if someone were to appear to save Ling Aotian, it would be Jiang Mu ninety-nine percent of the time.After all, the Black Water Fury had already become Jiang Mu\u2019s slave, and he needed to restore the outcome of the plot, but he was a man, so how could he look like a young girl.\u201cCould it be that ..\u201d\u201cThis young girl, he hired her to do the work instead of him? Or maybe he\u2019s pretending to come here?\u201dLihua did not quite understand.So curiously, she decided to watch for the time being, as the young girl rushed near the two Lightning Spirit duo.When the two brothers saw this, they both sneered and tried to warn.\u201cLittle sister, this place is very dangerous ..\u201dThey hadn\u2019t even finished their words.Jiang Mu then cast a transformation spell on them at the same time.\u201cTransform for my master!\u201dPow!Pow!The two big macho men were turned into two little kids in crotchless trousers.After Jiang Mu succeeded, he immediately turned around and ran away.The two kids who were looking at each other in confusion and disbelief as they were left behind.\u201cYou???\u201d\u201cMe???\u201dThis sudden and unexpected turn of events left them unable to react for a while.And Ling Aotian, who was lying on the ground, instantly, taking the opportunity like a protagonist as he made a move and rolled over to the side and leapt up.His fists gathered spiritual energy at the same time and dealt a fierce blow at the two little brats.\u201cDie for me!!!\u201dBoom boom!!!\u201c\u201d Arghhhh!!!\u201d\u201dOne man went berserk. Two little brats cried out in pain, and smoke and dust rolled.It was a fierce spectacle, but the Lihua was not watching at all.Her gaze, all the time, was glued to the back of Jiang Mu, who ran away.Her face was still stunned by what she had just witnessed.\u201cThat young girl actually \u2026 Can actually transform someone into a child?!\u201d\u201cWhat a powerful transformation technique!\u201d\u201cThis is a hundred times more powerful than my white fox clan\u2019s \u2018Thousand Faces Technique\u2019!\u201d\u201cI want to learn this!!!\u201dLihua excitedly chased after Jiang Mu.For one thing, she personally was fond of spirit arts like transformation and disguise.Secondly, if she learned this transformation technique and taught it to her clan, then it would be more convenient and easy for her White Fox clan to blend in within the Kyushu Continent!\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that.\u201d\u201cI came here on a whim, just to have some fun with Jiang Mu.\u201d\u201cInstead, I met such a magical girl!\u201d\u201cThis trip was not in vain!\u201dLihua was going to take this opportunity to get in touch with that young girl and get on good terms with her.From there, she hopes to learn this powerful transformation technique from her!Even if she had to pay a great price, she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do so!\u201cShit! Why is this Lihua thing coming after me?\u201dJiang Mu hid behind a ruin.Peeking out, he saw an innocent and sweet white skirt girl running towards him with a face full of excitement.\u201cWhat\u2019s she so excited for, is she rushing to be reincarnated!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not enough that she didn\u2019t help Ling Aotian, now she\u2019s chasing me for no reason?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s crazy in the head!\u201dAs he cursed, Jiang Mu prepared to use Extreme Flash to escape.However, Lihua suddenly burst out with powerful spiritual power and accelerated to leap in the air, and instantly flew behind Jiang Mu.She quickly grabbed his hand, revealing an innocent yet sweet smile.\u201cHello there~ My name is Xiaohua, what\u2019s your name?\u201dCall me your daddy!Are you looking for a fight? Why don\u2019t you just go through the plot instead of running to me.Do you think I won\u2019t let a snake bite you?Jiang Mu wanted to call the Black Water Fury this instant to kick her ass.But he could only think about it.After all, if he exposed the Black Water Fury to her, it would be even more chaotic.So he put on an air of indifference and said coldly back.\u201cMy name is Dehua, please let go, I have to leave.\u201dWith that, she tried to pull her arm out.However, he could not, because the real cultivation level of Lihua was Qihai Mirror, and her strength was greater than his own.\u201cYour name is Dehua? Then we\u2019re a good match eh! You can be my sister!\u201dLihua\u2019s two eyes flashed with a fox-like light, with a \u2018we\u2019re good sisters\u2019 expression.Be your sister! You\u2019re an old hag who is 400 years old!Jiang Mu secretly scolded while undauntedly pulling out his arm.To avoid unnecessary trouble, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with her.After pulling his arm out a few times, still to no avail, he angrily said.\u201cLet go of my arm! Don\u2019t force me\u2026 I\u2019ll beat you up!\u201d\u201cWoo~ my good sister, you\u2019re so thin-skinned, sister I\u2019m so sad~\u201dLihua\u2019s eyebrows were sad and pitying, and she was sad to cry.Secretly, however, she was casting the technique of \u300eSame Fragrance Enchanting Technique\u300f.Her fair skin emitted an invisible enchanting fragrance.This enchanting fragrance possessed the effect of \u2018same-sex attraction\u2019, and could charm the soul of the same sex, making the same sex feel good and dependent on her.And to make the effect even better.Lihua then wrapped her hands around Jiang Mu\u2019s small waist and pressed her whole body up against him and made an intimate bumping motion.At the same time, she raised her fragrant and smooth knees and rubbed them against his.Crap! She is playing foul!Jiang Mu\u2019s whole body shuddered.He was so turned on by her bumping and rubbing that he almost undid his transformation spell.So he hastily clamped his legs together and used his hands to push her fragrant shoulders away.\u201cStop it! If you do that again, I\u2019m going to get rough!\u201dHuh? This Dehua girl\u2026 Why is she Fragrance Enchanting Technique?Lihua was so stunned that she stopped moving.This was the first time she had seen a female who was immune to the \u2018\u300eSame Fragrance Enchanting Technique\u300f\u201d.It couldn\u2019t be.As long as the other party\u2019s soul was female, they could never remain unaffected.Could it be due to\u2026 Too little fragrance?After thinking about it, Lihua resolutely cast the Same \u2018Fragrance Enchanting Technique\u2019 but this time with all her might.Her skin, emitted a strong enchanting fragrance.So much so that her entire figure, at once, became fragrant.\u201cCough cough cough .. Ah-choo-ah-choo!!!\u201dJiang Mu was choking and sneezing terribly.And with this look on his face, it was obvious that he hadn\u2019t been affected.How could that be!Lihua was really shocked this time.This enchanting fragrance was so strong that it could captivate the soul of a person of the same sex, regardless of species!But why was this girl \u2026Wait, could this young girl\u2026 Is actually a man?For some reason, Lihua thought of this absurd possibility.But the sensation of impact and friction just now told her.That was clearly a female characteristic.Then why?Lihua was surprised by this insane girl. Never once had she met someone like her.Turning her thoughts in the opposite direction.She immediately used the \u300eDifferent Fragrance Enchanting Technique\u300fto conform her guess.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How I want it so badly \u2026. Put it in her \u2026.Looking at the pure and sweet girl in front of him, Jiang Mu had an urge from the bottom of his heart, wanting to immediately push her down \u2026. Also, due to this urge, led him to cause the root reaction.Along with!!!Puff!The urge was so great Jiang Mu couldn\u2019t think properly and eventually lifted his transformation skill, unconsciously, changing from the cute girl, back to his original appearance.\u201cYou\u2026 You are \u2026.?\u201dLihua\u2019s small mouth was wide open and stared in disbelief.The Magical Girl who she was holding and rubbing herself\u2026. Is Jiang Mu?!While she was shocked, Jiang Mu\u2019s handsome face, gradually approached her face at speed.\u201cWhat are you going to do \u2026. MuhhMuhhh?!!!\u201dLihua\u2019s mind went blank instantly. Her body stiffened, sexy long legs that were rubbing his tensed up, and straight like a tree branch, and both hands also reflexively hold Jiang Mu\u2019s waist.And at this moment, Jiang Mu, has fallen into a wonderful dream state.The warmth, tenderness, softness, and fragrance of the Lihua are all tempting his soul.Making him want more!So, with one of his hands, he could not help but climb the slope.Dancing wildly on the slope.Suddenly, a hoarse, ruthless voice rang out in his head.\u201cDispersal!\u201dSnap!!At the same time, Jiang Mu\u2019s thoughts instantly became clear.Looking at the dumbfounded young girl who was sticking to him, he immediately pushed her away.Chu~! The lips parted.That deformed mountain slope was also able to regain its shape from his clutches.Bad bad bad bad \u2026.Looking at Lihua who licked her mouth in front of him, Jiang Mu secretly shouted \u2018Screwed\u2019.He kissed Lihua!The fourth female heroine!Furthermore, the key is that Lihua saw his true face!What to do! What to do \u2026..When Jiang Mu\u2019s mind was in chaos, thinking of all possible disasters. Lihua in front of him, suddenly grabbed his hand.\u201cPatriarch Jiang~\u201dLihua actually smiled sweetly, as if it did not care at all about what had just happened.Then, her small and pretty body.Then, with a change visible to the naked eye, it slowly became convex in the front and curvy in the back.That white dress, also slowly became a long slit skirt and white brocade jacket.Eventually, she went from being a pure and sweet girl in a white dress.Became draped in a white cotton jacket, wearing a revealing enchanting and charming woman.The pair of seductive Phoenix eyes looked at Jiang Mu with a smile:.\u201cI Lihua, two days ago, sent you a congratulatory gift for marriage and while also opening the back door to you, a discount. Get one to get one free, remember?\u201dSaid as she deliberately leaned forward, swaying close to Jiang Mu.The soft and melodious voice, from her bright red lips wafting fragrance out:.\u201cDo you still want to touch it~\u201dGulp!!Jiang Mu couldn\u2019t help but gulp.Looking at that unfathomable beauty, he was both wanting to measure and very annoyed.Damn it, this bewitching fox is crisp, and clean, showing up directly to me.She is flea-like, clearly is seducing me! (Notes: Fleas (Siphonaptera) are Insects, parasites that live by ingesting the blood of their hosts)But what good is it to her to seduce me?Jiang Mu quickly pondered.He knew very well the persona of Lihua.She wouldn\u2019t do anything without the benefits, then what did she want from him?I can\u2019t quite understand \u2026.Seeing Jiang Mu dumbfounded and unresponsive, Lihua suddenly pushed her whole body against him.The bright red lips close to his ear, breathing like an orchid:.\u201cPatriarch Jiang ~ the transformation of your spiritual arts, will you teach me *Lick*?\u201dSaying that, the fragrant smooth tongue \u2018sucking\u2019 his ear naughtily.Shudder!!Jiang Mu felt that his body\u2019s wild energy was about to be slipped out by her.As expected of a fox!Damn it, so it was because of my transformation technique!No wonder, Jiang Mu finally understood the behavior of Lihua.Her white fox clan was good at disguise transformation techniques.Because the human race and the demon race are hostile, so on the Kyushu continent, there is almost no trace of the demon race.And her white fox clan relies on the unique Disguise Art, and with that they can move back and forth between the demon and human populations without being easily detected.But if you have a more powerful disguise change technique.Then for her white fox clan, it will be more convenient and easy to mix within the Kyushu continent, which greatly improves their security.But I can\u2019t teach this transformation art, ah!Even if I can teach it, why should I teach you?What\u2019s more, this is going to mess up the plot, for sure!Jiang Mu didn\u2019t even think about it, refusing her immediately.\u201cCan\u2019t teach, I\u2019m leaving, goodbye.\u201dHe pushed away Lihua, turned around and walked away, not wanting to get involved with her.But Lihua wrapped her arms around his waist from behind.She pressed up again, her red lips pressed to his ear, breathing a fragrance.\u201cPatriarch Jiang ~ as long as you are willing to teach me, then I promises you everything oh ~\u201dRUB.!RUB.!RUB.!Raising her knees and rubbing her thigh with his.Crap! Jiang Mu\u2019s body, again, shuddered uncontrollably at this mind-boggling sensation.Damn it, this monster!No wonder, Lihua pavilion is getting bigger, and bigger, throughout all over the continent!\u201cLet go! Or don\u2019t blame me for not being polite!\u201dJiang Mu tried to release the slender hand that was clasped on the stomach.But failed to do so.F*ck with chicken like body. I can\u2019t do anything.He had no choice but to call Black Water Fury to come out and knock her out.However, the following words from Lihua made him give up on this idea.\u201cPatriarch Jiang, you have already taken away my first kiss.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t compensate me, then I will be very sad.\u201d\u201cWhen I get sad, I won\u2019t participate in this Sound of Day and Sun, instead go home and cry.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t go out again before three or two years crying. Sniff.!Sniff.!~\u201dSaid as, she sobbed sadly as her chin rested on Jiang Mu\u2019s shoulder.And this time pressing her babies on him.F*ck! Leave here and go home? Never leave the house again for three or two years?Then there\u2019s no way the plot will continue in the original way!Jiang Mu was really panicked.Although not really convinced that Lihua would do that, but what if?What to do, what to do \u2026.At this time, from behind the ruined wall, far away came Ling Aotian\u2019s cheerful voice.\u201cMiss Xiaohua! I\u2019ve snatched a demon core! I\u2019ll give you one!\u201dThe voice was getting closer and closer.Obviously, Ling Aotian was running towards this way.If Ling Aotian saw the true faces of his own and the Lihua.Then this event is good as destroyed.No way, Jiang Mu had no choice but to use a temporary measure to calm down Lihua.Then turned his head and said to her sharply.\u201cI promise you.\u201cHowever, you are not allowed to tell anyone about these things that have happened!\u201cAlso, we all change back first, quickly!\u201dPuff!He took the lead in turning into a young girl in a yellow dress.\u201cOkay, Patriarch Jiang~\u201dLihua gave a flirtatious smile as she was victorious.She let go of Jiang Mu and squeezed her hand to activate the secret skill.\u201cThousand Face Technique!\u201dImmediately afterwards, her front and back figure.Then, with changes visible to the naked eye, it slowly contracted.Even the long skirt with the exposed slit turned into a white skirt.Eventually, her entire body turned into an innocent and sweet young girl.\u201cSister Dehua! There are many little demon beasts here, sister will show you around!\u201dLihua smiled sweetly at Jiang Mu with delight.Then, pulling her arm, she walked out of the ruins.What an actor!Jiang Mu cursed, expressionlessly, being pulled out by her.\u201cMiss Xiaohua, this is the \u2026. one just now?\u201dAfter Ling Aotian reached the Ruins, he saw Lihua pulling a beautiful young girl in a yellow dress and walking out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

May I ask the name of the girl?\u201dAfter Ling Aotian introduced himself, he gave Jiang Mu his usual charming smile.Looking at him, Jiang Mu was speechless.To smile as if drolling at the sight of a female was worthy of a male protagonist.However, this also showed that Ling Aotian\u2019s protagonist persona was quite normal.As he explored and fought time and time again, and met beautiful women, Ling Aotian had slowly grown up and knew how to use his charm to attract women.Jiang Mu glanced at the Lihua beside him and gestured for her to reply for him.After all, he only wanted to restore the outcome of the plot. There was no need to involved with Ling Aotian.Lihua seemed to understand Jiang mu\u2019s mind.So she opened her mouth and said back to him.\u201cHer name is Dahua, she\u2019s my sister, she doesn\u2019t like to talk, so don\u2019t talk to her in the future.\u201dAfter saying that, she even turned her head and smiled sweetly at Jiang Mu.It was as if she was asking for praise: i\u2019m smart, right?Jiang Mu gave her an irritated look instead.How does it make you smart?And Ling Aotian let out a loud laugh and said.\u201cSo it\u2019s Dahua, really, you two sisters are so beautiful!\u201d\u201cSince Miss Dahua doesn\u2019t like to talk, then I will not bother you at all!\u201dAlthough, he had wanted to ask Dahua how she had turned that Shining Spirit duo cultivators into children.More importantly, why had she risked her life to save him?Could it be that she had secretly observed him and was attracted to him?So eager to confirm, but since Xiaohua has voiced her opinion.It could wait, and he had to bury these questions in his heart for the time being.But the fact that Dahua had saved him, he, Ling Aotian, would never forget it!I must protect her, repay her well, and finally succeed in capturing her heart and making her one of my Ling Aotian women!He swore to himself.In his mind, the faces of Xue Menghan, Lu Chorou, Ding Nanrong, Han Yuqing, Black Water Fury, Lihua, and Xiaohua his future women emerged.Returning to reality, Ling Aotian readily took out two demon cores and two precious swords.And without hesitation, he handed them to Dahua (Jiang Mu), saying with genuine affection.\u201cMiss Dahua, this is what I snatched from those two.\u201d\u201cPlease do take them, Miss Dahua and consider it as a thank you for your help!\u201dJiang Mu did not take it.Instead, the Lihua beside him took it and said with dissatisfaction.\u201cYoung master Ling, you just said you\u2019d give me a demon core and now it\u2019s all given to my sister, what about mine?\u201dLing Aotian was a little embarrassed by the question.He rubbed his nose to hide his poorly spoken words and actions, and confidently said.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Miss Xiaohua When next time, I will definitely snatch it for you!\u201dLihua was about to say something else, but Jiang Mu quietly whispered in her ear.\u201cHurry up, don\u2019t waste time.\u201dLihua understood, so she said to Ling Aotian.\u201cThen it\u2019s a deal, let\u2019s set off now.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha! Good!\u201dLing Aotian laughed aloud.Then he turned around in style and led the way towards the center of the ancient city, intending to scout for demonic beasts or other cultivators.Perhaps this ancient city was at the frontier and there were not many demonic beasts.So for a whole day, he didn\u2019t find anything.The time came at night.Inside a dilapidated residential house.Ling Aotian felt that he had disappointed Xiaohua\u2019s expectations by not being able to snatch the treasure and instead got beaten.So he took it upon himself to guard the entrance to the hall, to ensure the safety of the two maidens.And inside the back hall.Jiang Mu, who had changed back to his original appearance, was sitting on the floor with his eyes closed and legs crossed.Like an old monk in meditation.Lihua is still in the form of an innocent and sweet young girl in a white dress.At this moment, she was sitting next to Jiang Mu, folding her legs sideways, her arms propped up on the ground, her half-bared chest pressed against Jiang Mu\u2019s arm, her chin resting on his shoulder, her long beautiful hair intentionally falling down between his thighs.Her beautiful eyes swirled as if they could shoot water in his face.It had been going on for an hour.Yet Jiang Mu hadn\u2019t given a damn about her.He had been thinking hard about it.About how to solve the dilemma of the Lihua pestering him and wanting to learn the transformation technique.(Damn, what a blunder. I didn\u2019t think at all that Lihua would want to learn the Transformation Technique!)Jiang Mu was going crazy.But since Lihua, the female protagonist, was barely intertwined with himself, the Villain.So, he would naturally, ignore Lihua.It also ignored this request from Lihua, who wanted to learn a highly skilled transformation technique.(All of her white fox clan were born with brow bones, cunning beyond belief, and especially good at turning men into a male sl*t) (Notes: In Chinese, brow bones meaning to control and dominance. The stronger the brow bone, the more dominant and aggressive a person is.)9And she, Lihua herself, is most definitely more skilled at it than ordinary fox women.)Although in the original story, Lihua hadn\u2019t personally gone down to engage with mens, and had always been running the business as the Pavilion Master, moving around for her clan. But Jiang Mu was absolutely convinced.And besides, as the fourth female lead, Lihua, once she became powerful.It would be the equivalent of a cow riding a rocket launcher, a cow that would blow up the sky.Her level of difficulty was no less than Black Water Fury!(Damn it, also, Lihua already knows my true nature.)(Even if I return to the Wuyou Sect, she will definitely come looking for me and try to ask me to teach her the Transformation Technique.)(But I can\u2019t really teach this transformation technique even if I want to!)Jiang Mu thought for a long time.He could not think of any good way to get the hell out of this mess.(\u201cI don\u2019t care anymore. Let\u2019s forget about it for the time being.)(Let\u2019s take a look at today\u2019s diary reward.)He remembered today\u2019s diary reward and hadn\u2019t checked it yet.So opened the reward message.[Date: 15th of March. The weather is beautiful and sunny.][Temperament +2 (24/100)][Face Value +2 (24/100)][Reward obtained: Spiritual Energization (Spiritual Arts)][Description of Reward: Little Universe, Blast for Master.

It seems that tonight, he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep well.With her \u2018inquisitive\u2019 attitude, if I fell asleep, she would definitely force me to have an erotic dream!\u201cIf you want to learn how to transform arts, then you better behave yourself, go to sleep and leave me alone!\u201dTo keep his ears clean, Jiang Mu had to draw a pie for her first.\u201cSure!\u201dAs soon as Lihua heard this, she immediately changed from her seductive and provocative horny look to an innocent and sweet quiet girl.It was just that.She was afraid that Jiang Mu would run away, so she wrapped her hands around his arms.Then, with a sweet smile, she leaned on his shoulder and fell asleep.This caused Jiang Mu to be speechless.He looked at the ring on his finger and concentrated on his mind, trying to communicate with the Black Water Fury in his head.\u201cLittle cutie?\u201d\u201cCutie?\u201d\u201cCutie Cutie.\u201d[What is it.]Oooh, you\u2019re really able to communicate.\u201cCutie, do you know of what happened with the Lihua and me?\u201d[Yes, this god has been using divine sense, sensing everything.]\u201cThen do you have any means, to make her stop pestering me?\u201d\u201cShe keeps seducing me, and I\u2019m having a hard time.\u201d[F*ck her]\u201c??\u201d\u201cI mean, get rid of her for good.\u201d[Kill.]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat\u2019s the point of having you!Jiang Mu felt that asking for help from the Black Water Fury was sheer stupidity on his part.Alas, let\u2019s take one step at a time.Time to sleep.\u2026The next day.The eastern part of the Kyushu Continent, the Changyu Empire.Yusheng port City, looking out over the sea.\u201cFather, who are we meeting this early in the morning?\u201dXue Menghan looked curiously at the teleportation portal in front of her.Her father, Xue Yuanshan, had brought her here, saying that it was to meet a big shot.\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to meet is a supreme figure who hasn\u2019t been seen in a thousand years!\u201dXue Yuanshan\u2019s tone was respectful, his expression solemn, and serious.\u201cA thousand-year untouchable? It seems someone very powerful.\u201dIt was the first time Xue Menghan had ever, seen her father look like this.\u201cThe word \u2018Powerful\u2019 is no longer enough to describe her.\u201dXue Yuanshan stroked the root of his beard and said with heartfelt admiration.\u201cIf I were to say.\u201d\u201cThere is anyone in the world who can unify the Kyushu Continent, that would be her!\u201dRight after he said that.The teleportation portal in front of them glowed.\u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201dBuzz!Two beautiful women dressed as guards were the first to walk out of the teleportation portal.They glanced around the Sea Watch Terrace.After confirming that there were only Xue Yuanshan and Xue Menghan, father and daughter.Only then did they signal to the other side of the teleportation portal that there were no abnormalities.Then, a beautiful woman dressed in a brocade dress appeared through the portal.And behind her, there were also two beautiful female guards.Immediately, Xue Yuanshan stepped forward and bowed to the beautiful woman in the middle, cupping his fist and saying respectfully.\u201cXue Yuanshan, Greeting the Empress of the Changyu!\u201dEmpress Changyu?Xue Menghan couldn\u2019t help but take a look at the beauty in front of her.Her body was tall, and her features were beautiful.The ink jade-like hair, held by a golden fork, was like a waterfall falling.The solemn and luxurious aura of her body seemed to be able to make people look up and kneel.\u201cHan\u2019er, what are you staring at, come and greet the empress.\u201dXue Yuanshan saw Xue Menghan standing still and hurriedly urged him on.\u201cMenghan greets the empress.\u201dXue Menghan immediately followed his father\u2019s example and bowed to Changyu An Meng.Changyu An Meng looked at Xue Menghan and was curious.So she was the first heroine?Then I \u2026. Will I be the heroine as well?And if so, what number would I be?With curiosity, she came in front of Xue Menghan.\u201cRaise your head, let me take a look at you.\u201dA gentle voice line reached Xue Menghan\u2019s ears, like a spring breeze.She lifted her head and looked at Changyu An Meng calmly.Perhaps due to her own pampered upbringing, she was used to the ladies and many high-ranking people.So even if it was the empress standing in front of her, she, Xue Menghan, didn\u2019t feel much.\u201cNot bad, not too submissive, quite like Aunt Lan\u2019s nature.\u201d\u201cAunt Lan?\u201dXue Meng Han\u2019s expression was puzzled.Changyu An Meng smiled faintly and said.\u201cYunlan, your mother, was also the captain of my personal guard.\u201dYunlan\u2026.Hearing this name of the departed, Xue Menghan\u2019s heart tightened.Her eyes gradually reddened.\u2026Lingyin Kingdom.Inside a certain ruined ancient city.Jiang Mu, who had turned into a yellow-skirted girl, sat on the stone wall of the ruins together with Lihua.They were like two sisters on a sightseeing tour.Watching the battle between a man and a demonic beast below.It was a battle between Ling Aotian and a two-tailed giant scorpion.\u201cSister, look.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s pressing the scorpion to fight, I guess he\u2019ll kill it soon.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think, sister?\u201dLihua shook Jiang Mu\u2019s arm and pointed down with great interest.Like the innocent little girl who loved to watch the fun.\u201cHe\u2019ll end up getting punched by the scorpion and flying.\u201dJiang Mu returned with an expressionless face.In the original plot.Ling Aotian was relying on the Black Water Fury\u2019s help, plus the Lihua\u2019s partisan attacks.Only then was he barely able to defeat this two-tailed giant scorpion and obtain the spoils of war.And during the battle, Ling Aotian and Lihua fought side by side and drew closer to each other.That is how they developed their relationship thread.And now? Jiang Mu touched the Ring and then looked at the Lihua beside him.Immediately noticing that Jiang Mu was looking at her, Lihua flashed a charming smile and said.\u201cSister, you\u2019re looking at me like that, what do you want to do to me?\u201dSaying so, she even brought her face closer.A \u2018you can do it\u2019 kind of look.Jiang Mu pushed her face away and said with displeasure.\u201cWhen Ling Aotian is punched away, we\u2019ll go down and kill that scorpion, and you\u2019re not allowed to be lazy, or you won\u2019t be taught the transformation technique.\u201dDamn, if he and Lihua didn\u2019t go down there.Then Ling Aotian would be good as dead unless he exposes his trump card.\u201cSure!\u201d Lihua was quick to agree.She naturally knew what Jiang Mu was planning to do.And she couldn\u2019t wait for Jiang Mu to make more demands of her to learn the Transformation Technique.It would be even better if the demands were excessive.Like something like \u2018if you don\u2019t have intercourse with me, I won\u2019t teach you the transformation technique\u2019 or something like that.If she could have intercourse with Jiang Mu, the better.As a member of the White Fox clan, she had absolute confidence that she\u2019d be able to tame Jiang Mu into submission!While she was scheming secretly, a pained scream was heard.\u201cArgghhh\u2026!\u201dFrom the battlefield below, It was Ling Aotian\u2019s miserable scream came.He was swept away by the giant scorpion\u2019s tail.THUNK! With that sound, he fell hard to the ground, spitting out several mouthfuls of blood and struggling to stand up.It looked like he was unable to defeat the Twin-Tailed Giant Scorpion.\u201cNow is the time!\u201dJiang Mu gave an order and immediately jumped down.Lihua followed closely behind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Miss Xiaohua! Thank you all! Thank you!\u201dLing Aotian, who was lying miserably on the ground, was so touched that he was on the verge of tears.These two beautiful maidens stood up for him. Ling Aotian.I, Ling Aotian, swear! I will never let you down in this life!Lihua leapt up and spun in a magnificent circle in mid-air.Raising her sword, she chopped down on the head of the giant scorpion.\u201cXiaohua Chopping Slash!\u201dGrrrrr!The giant scorpion\u2019s head cracked with a slash from Lihua.The black blood soared out from the crack.The agonizing pain drove the giant scorpion into a rage and chased after Lihua.And Jiang Mu followed closely behind.\u201cXiaohua Chopping Slash\u2026 What a shitty name, it\u2019s so corny.\u201dJiang Mu muttered mockingly about the name of Lihua\u2019s attack move.While looking for an opportunity to see if he could pierce the giant scorpion\u2019s bone ball with his sword.Suddenly, the giant scorpion stopped and a cry for help was heard from Lihua up ahead.\u201cArghhhah! Sister help me!\u201d?????What the hell.Jiang Mu raised his eyes to look and was stunned to see the sight.Lihua was caught in the scorpion\u2019s giant pincers, high up in mid-air, her legs flailing in panic.F*ck!Damn it, aren\u2019t you in the Qi Sea realm!How the hell would you get caught against a Spirit Realm demon beast?Jiang Mu cursed looking at the obvious fake act!He could only think of one possibility.Lihua had been caught on purpose!But why?\u201cSister help me! I\u2019m going to get crushed! Waaaa~\u201dLihua kept thrashing her legs, crying and shouting.Her voice sounded fearful.How can it kill you? You\u2019re just pretending!Jiang Mu was indignant and had no intention of saving her.He was instead going to take advantage of the scorpion\u2019s halt and find an opportunity to kill the beast.\u201cMiss Xiaohua!!!\u201dLing Aotian, who was slowly standing up, roared in pain and his eyes were bloodshot with anxiety.The person he loved was now in crisis for saving him, and there was nothing he could do about it!He hated it!Why hadn\u2019t his master returned in time!In his heart, Ling Aotian\u2019s respect for Black Water Fury had already begun to turn into hate for her actions.If the Black Water Fury had been there, it would not have come to this!No! I still have my cards!Ling Aotian suddenly thought of the prismatic crystal block in his heart.Hope was instantly born again.But the next moment he became worried.If he exposed his last Trump card \u2026.Then how should I explain to Miss Xiaohua and Miss Dahua?How will they see it?What if they ask me for it \u2026. What should I do?And just during Ling Aotian\u2019s indecision.Jiang Mu immediately went around to the side of the giant scorpion and prepared to save Lihua.With curses in his mind.\u201cDamn it, if because of her Ling Aotian is going to reveal his cards early.\u201d\u201cThen the plot will be messed up.\u201d\u201cWhat a pain in the ass since I\u2019ve met her!\u201dHe wanted to complain, but it couldn\u2019t be helped right now.Ling Aotian\u2019s angry roar just now reminded him.If he didn\u2019t step in to save Lihua.Then Ling Aotian would make a move.Therefore, he had to save her himself.\u201cSister, save me! You hurry! Woooo~\u201dLihua saw Jiang Mu as if she had seen hope.What the hell! I\u2019ll stab you with my sword if I hurry again!Jiang Mu was furious. He went around to the giant scorpion\u2019s pincers.Raising his sword, he leapt forward and slashed down at the pincers.\u201cLunar Sky Strike!\u201dPang!The pincer was too hard and could not be severed.\u201cSister-sister! Hack it to death! WAaaaa~\u201dLihua cries got louder, but if you look closely, you can see that she is crying without tears.She was even crying with a stifled smile.But right now Jiang Mu\u2019s all focused on slashing the giant scorpion\u2019s pincers, so he didn\u2019t have time to observe her subtle expressions.Dang! Dang! Dang!Even with several slashes, those pincers remained unscathed.\u201cTurn into a pig for me!\u201dJiang Mu suddenly remembered the Transformation Technique and used it to turn the giant scorpion into a pig.However, the scorpion didn\u2019t turn successfully.Only then did he remember.The Transformation Technique was to turn one person, into another person.It was ineffective when used on a demonic beast that had not been transformed.\u201cRight, I almost forgot about Spiritual Energization!\u201dJiang Mu remembered the reward from yesterday.That was the ability to stimulate the spiritual power within the dantian for extreme power.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll take advantage of this opportunity now.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see how powerful this skill really is!\u201dHe leaped out of range of the giant scorpion\u2019s attack.With a thought in his mind, he said.\u201cSpiritual Energization Activation!\u201dThe next moment.Within his dantian, a red \u2018Essence Blood Dan\u2019 condensed out.Under the stirring of the Essence Blood Dan.The spiritual energy within the entire dantian was like a volcanic eruption.It surged out to all corners of his body.Boom!Jiang Mu\u2019s body instantly erupted with a blue aura visible to the naked eye.This aura evaporated rampantly.It made his skirt and hair rise and caused the debris on the ground to float and shake.He was in the form of a Super Saiyan 3. (Notes: Super Saiyan 3 is Goku\u2019s most powerful non-god Super Saiyan form in the Dragon Ball canon and is incredibly powerful such that it allowed him to bend time and space while he was transforming.)\u201cHoly shit! The power in my body is gushing up in a torrent.\u201d\u201cIt feels like it is about to explode!\u201dJiang Mu\u2019s fists clenched as he experienced this powerful force.At this moment, even if Lihua was a Qi Sea realm, he could still pin her down and rub her against the ground for three and a half seconds!Without hesitation, he leapt once again, raised his sword, and slashed down at the scorpion\u2019s entire body.\u201cLunar Sky Strike!!!\u201dA curved moon shaped spiritual sword light shot out.It slashed down perfectly on the scorpion\u2019s body.Grrrggg!The giant scorpion was cut in half on the spot, spilling blood everywhere.Lihua was also freed from the predicament and was falling from mid-air.\u201cCatch me, sister! I\u2019m going to fall to my death! I\u2019m going to die!\u201dJiang Mu saved the day and jumped to catch Lihua.Finally, landing steadily on the ground.\u201cRelease!\u201dHe immediately lifted the state of Spiritual Energization Activation to stop the ridiculous consumption of Spiritual Energy.\u201cSister! I almost thought I wouldn\u2019t see you again! *Sniff*~\u201dAfter being saved, Lihua hugged Jiang Mu tightly.Probably because she had come back from the brink of death, so much so that she was scared.Scared to the point of upper body bumping.Scared to the point of raising her legs and rubbing them.Jiang Mu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe seemed to understand something.\u201cSister~ Thank you for saving sister~\u201dLihua\u2019s eyes were springing with joy and filled with emotion.She hugged Jiang Mu\u2019s face and her lips sealed with his.Jiang Mu resisted: \u201cMummmmm!\u201dChu! Lips parted.A crystalline pull shone out in a sunlight ray.With a lick of his lips, Jiang Mu sort of figured it all this drama she pulled off.The reason Lihua had been caught on purpose and asked him to save her.The reason was to create a cliche situation where \u201chero saves the heroine\u201d so that she could get closer to him and become more intimate.In the end, it was also obvious that the purpose was to make him teach her the transformation technique!Damn, you\u2019re really worthy of being called, demonic vixen!\u201cMiss Xiaohua! Miss Dahua! You guys \u2026..\u201dLing Aotian covered his abdomen and rushed in with a face full of anxiety.But when he saw the two girls just now doing something \u2026..Somehow, he felt an inexplicable excitement.Once he thought of the future, these two beauties would become his\u2026He became even more excited.So excited that he felt his injuries, almost healed!Excited, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s really great that you two sisters are okay!\u201cThank you for saving me, this kindness will never be forgotten!\u201d\u201cI, Ling Aotian, will definitely repay you!\u201dLihua frowned in displeasure and said.\u201cYoung Master Ling, is all talk but no action, no sincerity Hump, I even almost died, why didn\u2019t you come to my rescue?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s \u2026. I actually wanted to save \u2026.\u201dLing Aotian was speechless, his face turning slightly embarrassed.He had originally decided to expose his cards to save her, but when he saw Dahua rushing to save her, he gave up with a sigh of relief.Jiang Mu elbowed Lihua, signaling her not to look for trouble for nothing.Understanding the gesture like a good woman, Lihua said with a smile.\u201cSince Young Master Ling has said you wanted to save, then it means that there\u2019s someone else in your heart.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very happy.\u201dAfter saying that, she happily took Jiang Mu\u2019s arm.Turning around, they walked away together.Looking at the lovely backs of the two girls, Ling Aotian revealed a relieved smile.\u201cYeah, I already have her in my heart, that\u2019s very important.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s so happy, which means she\u2019s not complaining that I didn\u2019t save her.\u201d\u201cMiss Xiaohua, is so gentle!\u201d\u201cI, Ling Aotian, will not fail you!\u201dLing Aotian, thought as followed cheerfully.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You will be my own \u2026..\u201dShe suddenly stopped her words and withdrew the word \u300e\u2019Personal Guard\u2019\u300f from her mouth.Because she thought of Jiang Mu\u2019s Private DiaryXue Menghan is the first female lead\u2026..Thinking of this.With a faint smile, Changyu An Meng changed her tone and said.\u201cMenghan, from today onwards, you are my sister.\u201dThis statement was made.The four female personal guards were all shocked.In fact, this morning, the Empress had revealed that she would recruit a personal guard to add a sister to the four of them.But now the empress had actually changed her mind?She was going to take this young girl as her\u2026 Sister?They looked at Xue Menghan, who was seated opposite them, in disbelief.They wanted to know what was so special about this young girl that she could gain the empress\u2019 favor.Xue Menghan, however, was startled.She hurriedly wiped away her tears.\u201cEmpress, I am just an outsider, if I were to become your sister, this would be against the rules of the Imperial Royal Family \u2026.\u201dChangyu An Meng interrupted her and said in a calm tone.\u201cIn the Changyu Empire, the words spoken by me are the rules.\u201d\u201cYou are my sister, so it\u2019s settled.\u201dXue Menghan was at a loss for words to return.This empress, so domineering.Next to her, Xue Yuanshan was excited.He had brought his daughter to meet the empress, knowing that the empress might give her a position as a personal guard.But he had never expected that the empress would actually recognize his daughter as her sister!This was equivalent to being under one person and above all others!Xue Yuanshan suppressed his inner excitement and respectfully replied.\u201cI thank the empress for her kindness, on behalf of my daughter.\u201dChangyu An Meng nodded slightly.Then, from the Space Ring, she took out a white token with a \u2018fish\u2019 symbol.Handing it to Xue Menghan with her own hands.\u201cThis is Aunt Lan\u2019s personal guard identity token, and it is just right to return it to you now.\u201dXue Menghan hurriedly took the token.The word \u2018Personal guard\u2019 was engraved on the front, and the word \u2018Yun Lan\u2019 was engraved on the back.Changyu An Meng continued.\u201cWith this token, you will have unhindered access throughout the empire, and everyone who sees you will treat you with a seventh degree of courtesy.\u201d\u201cThank you, Empress!\u201dXue Menghan gripped the token as tightly as if it were an important treasure.It was not because this token was so powerful.It was simply because, it was her mother\u2019s remains.Next to her was City Master Xue.Looking at the \u2018Yunlan\u2019 of the token in his daughter\u2019s hand, he fell into a sad memory.But quickly adjusted.He had come to see Changyu An Meng because he had a major matter to report.It was about the \u2018Black Box\u2019.\u201cEmpress, this is the box that I found in the Demon Beast Mountain Range.\u201d\u201cIt has been authenticated by the Dark Night House.\u201d\u201cThis box is called the Bone Casket Box.\u201dXue Yuanshan took out a black box from his Space Ring.The black box was clearly structured, with eerie insect limb armor embedded around it.He also took out a formation scroll and placed it on the table.Next, he placed the bone and metal box in the center of the scroll.Then he quickly pressed the seal.\u201cArise!\u201dBuzz!The scroll glowed with a black aura.The next moment, Bone Casket box automatically dismantles itself with a \u2018chirp\u2019.A four-square bone brick was exposed to everyone\u2019s eyes.Xue Yuanshan took out the bone brick and handed it to Changyu An Meng.Continuing, he explained.\u201cInside this box, there is information about sects such as the Lihuo Sect, the Xuanyang Sect, the Wuyou Sect, Xue City, and so on in the Region of Lizhou.\u201d\u201cIt also contains information on the number of people in each cultivation realm tier in the state, the types of spiritual arts, the types of weapons, the types of formations, pills, talismans, and so on.\u201d\u201cMost importantly, it also contains a rough plan of the Shahe Demon Army\u2019s preparations to attack the southern border of Lizhou!\u201d\u201cThe empress only needs to inject her spiritual energy into the bone brick, and you will be able to investigate all the information.\u201dChangyu An Meng took the bone brick.Injecting her spiritual energy, she examined it in detail.She found that what Xue Yuanshan said was true in every way.She pondered for a moment before asking.\u201cWhen do you think, the Shahe Demon Army, will attack the southern border of the Lizhou Prefecture?\u201dXue Yuanshan stroked the roots of his beard and said with a heavy face.\u201cAfter a day\u2019s calculation, I and the officers of the city lord\u2019s office.\u201d\u201cThe final conclusion is, Shahe\u2019s demon army will attack the southern border of Lizhou at the end of the month.\u201d\u201cThat is, \u2026. In about fifteen days!\u201dChangyu An Meng, however, shook her head in denial.She put down the bone brick and analyzed it carefully to Xue Yuanshan, saying.\u201cThe Spirit Devouring Sand Worm Race, with its violent nature, is aggressive and fearless.\u201d\u201cThe fact that Shahe has lost this Box means that the plan is exposed.\u201d\u201cThe longer it drags on, the worse it will be for him.\u201d\u201cAnd Xue City has just finished holding its hunting season, and the cultivators are in a state of relaxation.\u201d\u201cPlus, the Dark Night House Master, Lu Chorou, had taken away a group of Xue City\u2019s mid-level elite cultivators, so much so that Xue City\u2019s battle strength had decreased.\u201d\u201cMore importantly, I learned that Shahe failed in the Demon Beast Mountain Range three years ago, and Desolate Lord Sha Bailun was furious.\u201d\u201cTherefore, under the pressure from above, in the current situation.\u201d\u201cI conclude that Shahe had begun to gather his demon soldiers on the first day his stronghold was destroyed.\u201d\u201cIt will take no more than seven days at most and Shahe\u2019s army will arrive at the Demon Beast Mountain Range and directly approach Xue City.\u201dSeven days!Xue Yuanshan\u2019s heart sank.He did not doubt Changyu An Meng\u2019s deduction in the slightest.It seemed, Xue City had to prepare for this in advance!\u2026It was noon.Jiang Mu and Lihua, were staying inside a dilapidated teahouse.Lihua was leisurely sipping the tea.While staring at Jiang Mu, who was sitting across the table with his eyes closed.\u201cSister, do you think Ling Aotian is a fool, not resting in such a high temperature, but instead running out to rob people\u2019s treasures.\u201dJiang Mu glanced at her and said coldly.\u201cHe went out to rob treasures, but isn\u2019t it just so he can give them to you?\u201dLihua laughed wryly and said beautifully.\u201cHee hee hee, are you jealous, sister?\u201d\u201cJealous my ass, I mean, you shouldn\u2019t be sitting here so leisurely, you should follow him out to rob the treasures.\u201dJiang Mu didn\u2019t bother to pay attention to her and continued to close his eyes to rest.Lihua moved up her butt and slid it to Jiang Mu\u2019s side in no time.Jiang Mu opened his eyes and stared at her coldly with a sideways glance.She gave a sweet smile and said.\u201cSister. In this heat, are you thirsty?\u201d\u201cShall I feed you some cold tea?\u201dSaying that, she poured a cup of tea and held it in her mouth.It went straight to Jiang Mu\u2019s mouth and kissed him.\u201cGet the hell away!\u201dJiang Mu held her chin in his palm and pinched her face hard with his fingers.Poof!She sprayed out the tea in her mouth from the pinch.\u201cI want to rest, leave me alone!\u201dJiang Mu took a seat away from her.Damn, what an annoying b!t(h!Jiang Mu was depressed and helpless.According to the original plot.Ling Aotian would sneak out at noon and snatch someone else\u2019s treasure with the intention of coming back to surprise Lihua.Instead, in order to investigate Ling Aotian, how could Lihua let him out of sight?So Lihua will sneak up on him.Later, the relationship starts to develop again.But now?This demon was actually molesting him here.Lihua saw Jiang Mu move away from him.Then she pitifully flopped down on the table and looked at him with unblinking eyes.She looked like a little girl with no one to love.Jiang Mu ignored it.He remembered that he hadn\u2019t written his diary for today.So\u2026 right in front of Lihua.Called out the diary and busied himself with writing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Well!\u201dLihua covered her mouth, trying to stifle her laughter, her beautiful eyes about to burst into tears.Jiang Mu just thought she was bored out of her mind and wanted to make some kind of noise to attract his attention.Heh, childish.So he didn\u2019t bother with her and continue writing.[But even if my charms are all over you, I\u2019m still the man you cannot have.][My perfect body, is reserved for my wife and lover only.][Oh, I should say, it\u2019s reserved for wives and daoist lovers, now with a super tight little cutie.]The Black Water Fury sleeping on his Space Ring -??[Hmm\u2026 Somehow.][Meantime, I\u2019m getting bored of being pestered by Lihua, probably.][I\u2019m actually, kind of missing the good, obedient Han Yuqing wife right now.][Or is it that I haven\u2019t seen this pervert for two days, so much so that the distance has created beauty?][Could it be that my tastes have become heavy?]...Wuyou Sect, Council Hall.Han Yuqing sat in a high seat, reading the diary.\u201cHey, Husband actually misses me.\u201d\u201cWhatever the reason is.\u201d\u201cWhen you come back, Husband, I\u2019ll make sure to reward you with a new style posture.\u201d\u201cHehehe.\u201dShe read the diary at the same time.Not forgetting to preside over the meeting below.\u201cPass on this madam\u2019s order.\u201d\u201cEase the selection criteria for disciples of the Wuyou Sect.\u201d\u201cDouble the number of months for all disciples.\u201d\u201cThe Sect\u2019s Secret Zones, Trial Forbidden Land, Book Storage Hall, Spirit Field, Spirit Weapon Temple, and Formation Pit will all be fully open for three days, and all disciples will have unconditional access.\u201d\u201cTo be implemented immediately!\u201d\u201cIn addition, a heavy reward is offered to one person, the one who guards the mountain gate, Uncle Fu.\u201dThese words were spoken.The elders and deacons at the bottom were in an uproar.They were strongly opposed to the doubling of the month and the full opening.Han Yuqing smiled wryly and pulled out the internal affairs token Jiang Mu had given her.Snap!It was placed firmly on the stone table.There was a sudden silence from below....[And Ding Nanrong. I kind of miss her too.][Probably because before I left, she said \u2018be safe\u2019 to me.][In retrospect, her gentleness seems to have started to come before her time.][I remember that she only slowly started to be attentive to me after she got strong in the middle and late stages.][It\u2019s strange.]...[How strange.]The cliff at the back of the mountain.Ding Nanrong sat quietly on a stone bench, listening to the chirping of the birds in the trees behind her, her gaze dull, watching the clouds and cranes fluttering below the cliff.Occasionally, she glanced down at the diary in her lap.After reading it.Again, she continues to stare blankly at the cloud of cranes fluttering about.Only when she recalls the words \u2018I miss her a bit too\u2019.Her gaze, it seemed, wasn\u2019t so dull anymore....[What else should I write.]Jiang Mu paused to think about what to write.But suddenly he found out that Lihua did not know when.She was already sitting next to him.\u201cWhat are you doing sitting next to me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything, hehehe.\u201dLihua smiled sweetly, and then lowered her head to scratch the table.Jiang Mu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe must be sick.Right, might as well just write about this devil casually.So the book continued to be written.[This morning. Lihua and I were working together to attack a two-tailed giant scorpion.][But Lihua, the demon, was causing mischief.][She purposely got caught so that I could go and rescue her.][And the result.][With the long, forked tongue of the little cutie, I can think that it was Laozi who showed his prowess and exploded with bullish power to kill the scorpion in one swing with my sword.][This heroic rescue, which instantly earned me a kiss from Lihua.][Although I pushed her away mercilessly, hiding my merit and reputation.][But I must say, her mouth, really fragrant, soft, and moist.][I\u2019m really afraid that if I get screwed by her like this a few times, I won\u2019t be able to resist the urge to bang her.]\u201cSister~\u201dThe slutty voice of a Lihua suddenly reached his ears.Jiang Mu subconsciously turned her head to look.He saw a Lihua\u2019s face zooming in with moist eyes and covering his lips.\u201cMmmmmmmmmmm!\u201dShit!What a sneak attack!I should have known, nothing good could come from this demon sitting next to me!Jiang Mu pushed her away fiercely.Chu~! Lips parted.\u201cI\u2019m warning you! If you want to learn transformation techniques, you will give me\u2026\u201dBefore the word \u2018peace\u2019 could be uttered, those moist lips overlapped again.\u201cMmmmmmmmmmm!\u201dShit!Is she bored or horny!Jiang Mu pushed her away hard again.This time, he found out that he couldn\u2019t.Because her whole body was mounted.Her arms were tightly wrapped around his neck.Five minutes later.Chu~~! Lips parted.\u201cDon\u2019t force me! Believe me or not \u2026.\u201dBefore he could finish yelling, his moist lips were over again.\u201cMmmmmmmmmmm!\u201dShit!Is she ever going to finish!Ten minutes later.Chu~~! Lips parted.\u201cGet the fuck out of here!\u201dJust after the scolding, the moist lips came over again.\u201cMmmmmmmmmmm!\u201dFifteen minutes later.Chu~~! Lips parted.Rub!I seem to be a bit addicted?Twenty minutes later.Chu~~! Lips parted.Twenty-five minutes later.Chu~~! Lips parted.Thirty minutes later.Chu~~! Lips parted.\u201cDamn it! I can\u2019t explode you!\u201dJiang Mu was completely riled up.He stopped, and picked up Lihua, and, in a feverish rush, headed for the guest room.\u201cHee hee hee, sis~ Love and cherish your sister Muhhh~\u201dLihua in his arms, five fingers pressed against Jiang Mu\u2019s Angry rod.Rubbing it fiercely.The rubbing caused Jiang Mu to shiver in waves.However, just at that moment.A cheerful laugh came in through the door.Miss Dahua! Miss Xiaohua! I, am back!\u201dLing Aotian had just stepped through the door of the teahouse.He saw Miss Dahua was holding the Miss Xiaohua, standing at the entrance to the guest room.Their faces were both very red.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you guys? Is it too hot?\u201dLing Aotian said with a smile and took out a Ring from the Space ring.\u201cLet me tell you guys a good news!\u201d\u201cI just met a cultivator who was left alone and robbed his Space Ring on the way.\u201d\u201cThere are quite a lot of good items inside, hahaha!\u201d\u201cMiss Xiaohua, I\u2019m going to give you the demon core!\u201dLing Aotian was about to take out the demon core from the Space Ring.But then he noticed that the way Miss Xiaohua, was looking at him was a bit off.It was as if \u2026. Hostile?Lihua was indeed annoyed and wanted to kill him so badly.She was about to tame Jiang Mu after a few rounds of attacks.And now it was all ruined by Ling Aotian!Jiang Mu, on the other hand, breathed a sigh of relief.Luckily, luckily \u2026.. It didn\u2019t turn out to be a big mistake \u2026.He put down Lihua by holding back his lust and coughed lightly.Trying his best to recover.But finding it so hard to recover, he went straight into the guest room, intending to take his time to calm it down.Lihua glared at Ling Aotian and said unhappily.\u201cYoung Master Ling, please don\u2019t disturb the two of us sisters.\u201dAfter saying that, she did not wait for Ling Aotian to reply.She followed Jiang\u2019s lead and went straight into the guest room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t you dare lift it!\u201dJiang Mu sternly stopped her.Damn, as expected of an all-female white fox clan, they were really loose.This demon, to get my transformation technique as soon as possible, is really willing to give her all.Looking at Lihua\u2019s small, visible breasts, Jiang Mu\u2019s fire, which had just cooled down a little, is stirred up even more, but he understood.You must not be fooled by her.After all, now, Black Water Fury, the female heroine, had fallen to the Villain\u2019s side.And he was already so busy trying to restore the outcome of the plot that he was almost at his limit.What if another heroine falls apart?Then one would sit back and wait for the clearance to fail in peace.Finally, return to previous world with empty hands and work like hell.\u201cFrom now on, don\u2019t even dare to touch me!\u201d\u201cOtherwise, I will never teach you the Transformation Technique!\u201d\u201cDo you hear me?\u201dUsing the Transformation Technique as a threat, Jiang Mu reprimanded Lihua without a rebuttal.However, Lihua ignored it.She knew that Jiang Mu, in fact, was now like a dam full of stored water.If a gap was opened, then he would definitely leak and burst.So she smiled seductively.\u201cSister, look at me~\u201dShe ran her hands up her chest and grabbed the edge of the bust.Pulling it violently to the sides.Boing! Boing!Crap Nima!Jiang Mu straightened his eyes on the spot, a surging fire raging through his whole body.Bang!He failed to control himself, causing the transformation spell to automatically lift.Lihua\u2019s beautiful eyes were shy as she approached Jiang Mu, who had changed back to his original form, step by step.In her heart, she was making a smug smile.Little boy, you said no lifting, but now your eyes are looking straight here with a blinking.In a moment, I will give you a taste of my white fox clan\u2019s years of cultivation.Make you fall deep and unable to pull yourself out!In fact, the reason why she was in a hurry to tame Jiang Mu.For one, it was because she couldn\u2019t wait to learn the transformation technique, after all, she didn\u2019t know when Jiang Mu would leave.Secondly, it was because this morning, Jiang Mu had exploded with powerful spiritual power and killed the giant scorpion with a single blow.This made her realize something suddenly.Jiang Mu\u2019s body must have other more magical and powerful spiritual arts or treasures besides the powerful transformation art and intuition told her.As long as Jiang Mu was tamed, then she, and even her White Fox clan.Would definitely gain unexpected benefits and live prosperity!\u201cSister, touch me~\u201dLihua\u2019s eyes moist as her upper body pushed up against Jiang Mu.Touch nympho!Jiang Mu cursed, his breathing already becoming fast.He could not hold back any longer.He couldn\u2019t care less about anything and immediately got up in front of Lihua.Casting out an immortal technique.\u201cExtreme Flash!\u201dA ray of light flashed out.It illuminated the little twin balls with a glowing white luster.When the light disappeared.Lihua looked at the empty guest room and her eyes grew wide with shock.\u201cH-he disappeared?!\u201dLihua hurriedly looked around, left, right, up and down, front and back, searching through the guest room carefully.Not even the rathole in the corner had been spared.Finally, she was completely sure.Jiang Mu had completely disappeared!\u201cHow did he do that?!\u201dLihua was so shocked that she couldn\u2019t breathe.She couldn\u2019t imagine how Jiang Mu had disappeared without a trace after turning into a ray of light.\u201cDoes that mean!\u201d\u201cHe possesses some kind of secret art of teleportation?\u201d\u201cYes! That must be the case!\u201d\u201cHe even has a transformation technique that can change his gender and transform others.\u201d\u201cThen it makes sense to have a teleportation technique!\u201d\u201cI need to learn this as well!!!\u201dLihua became so excited that her eyes sparkled.Jiang Mu is a real walking treasure!It really surprised her so much!This Teleportation Technique, compared to the Transformation Technique.It was even better!If she learned to teleport, if the entire Fox Clan learned to teleport.Then her clan would be able to travel to and from the Kyushu Continent without any difficulty!\u201cWait!\u201d\u201cMaybe\u2026 the dissipation of the ancestor\u2019s soul\u201d\u201cMaybe it can be solved through teleportation?\u201dLihua\u2019s heart stirred.She thought of the soul of her ancestor, the Fox Fairy, under the Nine Mysterious Quenching Cold Valley.The Fox Fairy\u2019s soul was dissipating day by day.If one did not enter the Lurid Immortal Realm and seek the power of the immortal soul.Then, the Fox Fairy\u2019s soul would dissipate.At that time, her Fox Clan, without the Fox Fairy Soul, would definitely fall out of the top three demon clans.Or perhaps even it would also fall into the abyss of eternal doom!\u201cJiang Mu, I must tame him!!!\u201dIt was as if Lihua had seen a way to remove the crisis of the Fox Clan.Every time she thought about it, she became more excited, so excited that her Blood accelerated.Eventually the excitement exceeded her head.Poof!A white fox tail burst out from her buttocks.The tail was so excited that it shook violently from side to side with great frequency.It made dust fly from the entire guest room....Wuyou Sect.The patriarch\u2019s hall chambers.A light shone out of thin air.The light disappeared, and Jiang Mu landed on the ground.\u201cLittle cutie! Come out!\u201dHe called out to Space Ring.Almost at the same time, black mist burst out.The black mist transformed into a little loli with golden pupils in a black dress and long black hair.Without saying a word, Jiang Mu picked up Black Water Fury and carried her to bed.Since he and Black Water Fury were in a master-servant relationship.So even if he didn\u2019t say anything, Black Water Fury was already aware of his thoughts.Thus, Black Water Fury took it lightly and grabbed the open sublime truth with her small hands.While pulling out her long, forked tongueTwo hours later.\u201cHiss ahhh-!!!\u201dThe Black Water Fury went limp on Jiang Mu\u2019s chest.Son of a b*tch! This god will definitely conquer you!She was very unconvinced.She had already realized that every time Jiang Mu was able to take control, and when she was about to surrender, he descended to heaven with her.Next time, this god will definitely make you surrender first!\u201cLittle cutie, you seem to be very unconvinced?\u201dJiang Mu couldn\u2019t help but smile.He could feel the strong competitive spirit of the Black Water Fury in his arms.\u201cSo what if I am! Next time, this god will definitely make you kneel down and beg for mercy!\u201dThe Black Water Fury\u2019s large golden pupils glared viciously at Jiang Mu.The glare made him laugh.Why did he suddenly find that she was a bit cute?Jiang Mu couldn\u2019t help stroking her face.He touched her left and pinched her right.It was quite soft and smooth.Black Water Fury didn\u2019t avoid it either, and her golden pupils still glared at him viciously.\u201cAlright, your eyes are about to bulge out, go back inside and sleep.\u201dJiang Mu slapped her buttocks and carried her to the side.Then he got up and got dressed.He intended to go and find Han Yuqing and Ding Nanrong.See if Han Yuqing had taken the inner affairs order from him and issued a series of sect regulations, as she had done in the original episode.Also, to see if Ding Nanrong, as per the original plot, was meditating and cultivating at the cliff at the back of the mountain every day.After resting for a while, Black Water Fury also got out of bed and rustled up her skirt.She looked at Jiang Mu\u2019s back and her eyes narrowed.This god had almost forgotten, this bastard, could teleportShe remembered earlier.Jiang Mu had taken her and Han Yuqing and teleported them inside a cave in the Demon Beast Mountain Range, and from within the cave, he had teleported back.And the day before yesterday, he had again teleported from the Wuyou Sect, directly to the ruined ancient city of the Lingyin Kingdom.This time, he directly teleported from the Ruined Ancient City, and teleported back here again.So could he also teleport to the Ancient Tomb of the Serpent God?\u201cWhat are you staring at me for?\u201dJiang Mu found that the Black Water Fury kept staring at himself.He didn\u2019t know what she was thinking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was the first time he had heard of it.Could it be a new route?Did the dog system start messing around again?Shit! Jiang Mu felt suddenly very worried.The only explanation he could think of now.Is the fact that the Black Water Fury\u2019s persona had collapsed, causing a new route to appear.\u201cLittle cutie, what\u2019s the Serpent God\u2019s Tomb? Why do you want to go there?\u201dHe had to understand this new route, and Black Water Fury\u2019s intentions.After all, she was still the third female protagonist, and any move she made could directly affect the outcome of the main plot.Black Water Fury pondered a little and replied back.\u201cThe Ancient Tomb of the Serpent God is located beneath the forbidden land of the Blackwater Jedi.\u201d\u201cInside the ancient tomb, the soul of an ancient snake god is sealed away.\u201d\u201cThis god wants to go back in order to make\u2013.\u201d\u201cIt is to pray to the Ancient Serpent God for blessings.\u201dShe was going to say \u2018to make permanent puppet of mine for Ling\u2019.But as the words came to her lips, she swallowed her words and lied.She was afraid that Jiang Mu would reject her if she knew her intentions.After all, it was better to be careful.\u201cPraying to the ancient snake god?\u201dIf that was all it was, then Jiang Mu would think nothing of it, but he didn\u2019t want to go.Because unknown, meant uncontrollable and uncertain happenings.So he asked rhetorically.\u201cWhy do you want to pray to the snake god? Can\u2019t you not pray?\u201dThe Black Water Fury narrowed her pupils and stared at Jiang Mu with a deadly gaze as she replied word for word.\u201cBecause this god\u2019s virginity was offered to you, the son of a b*tch, so I want to pray for a blessing to celebrate.\u201d????A broken V and a blessing to celebrate?What kind of damn reason is that.?Jiang Mu was speechless.He felt that this reason was nothing but bullshit.So he simply retorted.\u201cNo\u2014.\u201d He didn\u2019t finish his sentence.The Black Water Fury jumped up and hung on him, wrapping her arms around his neck.The little mouth printed down hard.\u201cMmmmm!\u201dShit! Why are you doing this to me too!Five minutes later.Chu~! Lips parted.The Black Water Fury licked her little lips.His face was flushed for the first time in her life.Those ruthless golden pupils actually contained shyness.Yet it was only what she pretended to be.She said in a shy voice.\u201cMaster, praying is my little wish, please master satisfy me\u2026\u201d(How humiliating!!! So want to kill!!! Ahhhhhhhhhh\u201d) Black Water Fury, inwardly thinking.Jiang Mu: \u201c\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t clear if she was really shy or faking it, but not to mention.This ruthless loli\u2019s shy look of hers was really something to behold.\u201cFine, I will take you there tomorrow morning.\u201dAfter thinking it over again, Jiang Mu finally chose to agree to her.For one thing, this was the first time she hadn\u2019t called herself \u2018this god\u2019, which made Jiang Mu realize that she really, really wanted to go back and pray to celebrate breaking V.Secondly, she was already his woman, so there was no excuse for him, as her man, to follow her back for a little blessing.Thirdly, the blessing wouldn\u2019t take long anyway, and after it was done, it would be good to immediately teleport back to the Spiritual Sound Country.\u201cThank you, thank you, master.\u201d...It was evening.With what little strength she had left, she transformed her naked body into a black mist and entered the Space Ring.Finally weak and exhausted, she slumped over on the bed and fell asleep.\u201cThis little cutie.\u201d\u201cJust this much fight and you presume to make me kneel down and beg for mercy?\u201d\u201cHah~, Too naive.\u201dJiang Mu twisted his waist and actually didn\u2019t feel tired.\u201cThis goodly waist of mine seems to be a little perverted.\u201dHe felt pretty okay about this reward.\u201cOh yeah, the reward for writing in the diary today, I haven\u2019t read it yet.\u201d\u201cForget it, let\u2019s go and check it out first, Han Yuqing and Ding Nanrong.\u201dJiang Mu intended to go and see if there was anything unusual about Han Yuqing and Ding Nanrong first.So he picked up his clothes from the table, under the bed and inside the bathroom and put them on.He didn\u2019t forget to jump up to the ceiling, take down Black Water Fury\u2019s black dress, and stuff it into the Space Ring.And finally, he headed straight to the cliffs at the back of the mountain.It didn\u2019t take long before Jiang Mu arrived behind a big tree.Looking at the edge of the cliff not far away.He saw a sexy and lonely back, staring blankly up at the moon.Wind from the cliff blew by, blowing up the beauty\u2019s twin braids with the fragrance of the short bustier dress.The fragrance drifted.It eventually drifted into the nose of Jiang Mu behind the tree.The smell made him drift off for a moment.\u201cWell, this old maid, still so serene and beautiful.\u201d\u201cShe is now, I think, reminiscing, the childhood image of grilling lamb kebabs.\u201dJiang Mu had no intention of disturbing her.After confirming that there was nothing unusual about Ding Nanrong, he turned around and left.But due to the panic just now, he accidentally stepped on a tree branch.It made a noise.Shit, my leg.Jiang Mu immediately looked back fearfully.He found the cliffside empty, with only a lone moon hanging in the night sky.Turning back.There he found that Ding Nanrong was already standing in front of him.\u201cThat, Rong\u2019er, good evening.\u201dJiang Mu scratched his head, and it was no good pretending that he couldn\u2019t see her.\u201cWhen did you come back?\u201dDing Nanrong\u2019s face was calm as her beautiful eyes scanned Jiang Mu.She smelled a strange smell.\u201cI Just got back.\u201dJiang Mu casually lied.After all, he had been doing \u2018dragon and snake play\u2019 with the Black Water Fury all afternoon. There wasn\u2019t much to say about it.At that point, Ding Nanrong didn\u2019t say anything more.She then passed by Jiang Mu and walked towards the cliff.Jiang Mu looked at her back in the moonlight.For some reason, a feeling of loneliness came over him.This was a feeling he had never experienced even after seventy times of reincarnation.Hmm. Could it be that the dog system, too, has secretly changed my persona of the villain?Shaking his head, Jiang Mu dismissed this possibility.He knew that this was just how he really felt.After thinking about it, he called out to Ding Nanrong.\u201cRong\u2019er.\u201dDing Nanrong stopped and turned around.Not knowing what Jiang Mu was calling out to her for.Without any extra expression or movement, Jiang Mu spoke naturally and said.\u201cSome day, I\u2019ll take you to eat grilled lamb skewers as a thank you for your protection for these three years.\u201dWell, as the Patriarch, it seemed reasonable to treat his personal servant girl.Ding Nanrong\u2019s eyelashes trembled slightly as she opened her mouth.Yet she didn\u2019t know what to reply to.She could feel the sincerity of Jiang Mu\u2019s words as he spoke them.It took a long time.Only then did she faintly reply.\u201cFeel free.\u201dThen she turned her body and walked towards the edge of the cliff to sit down.Resuming her blank stare up at the moon.\u201cHmm, this old virgin, still cold and few words, nothing unusual.\u201dJiang Mu turned around and went down the mountain.Then he went to find Han Yuqing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Did you just call me wife? I\u2019m so happy! Hehehe.\u201dHan Yuqing was smiling happily, really happily.That kind of mood.It was like a lackey at the bottom of the status ladder had been promoted to the head of the family overnight.She felt that the entire Wuyou Sect would soon become her possession!\u201cHusband, will you call me wife again?\u201dHan Yuqing whined and pouted.\u201cCall you hell, don\u2019t care about these details.\u201dJiang Mu propped her up and then asked.\u201cWhat have you done today? Tell me about it.\u201d\u201cOkay~!\u201d Han Yuqing, one by one, she told them what she had done.Han Yuqing continued one after another.For example. The criteria for selecting disciples of the Wuyou Sect were eased.Double the number of months for disciples.Within three days, fully open the Trial Forbidden Grounds, the Hall of Spiritual Weapons, the Formation Pool\u2026 etc.There was also a heavy reward for Uncle Fu.\u201cWhy are you offering a reward to Uncle Fu?\u201dJiang Mu was stunned.He remembered, that Uncle Fu, who was watching the mountain gate.After cursing the Wuyou Sect in the first place, he had run away, become a mountain gate watcher.\u201cBecause he insulted my Wuyou Sect, this madam has to deal with him!\u201dHan Yuqing\u2019s face was ruthless, and the authority of the Patriarch\u2019s wife radiated without fail.But, it was fine.After all, she had already become the Patriarch\u2019s wife, so it was normal to defend her sect\u2019s reputation.Jiang Mu didn\u2019t think it was a big deal.\u201cI have to go out tomorrow, so you should take good care of the sect.\u201dHe said as he turned around and headed out, planning to go back to the room to sleep.\u201cHusband wait a moment!\u201dHan Yuqing hurriedly called out to Jiang Mu.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jiang Mu turned around.\u201cHehe.\u201d Han Yuqing smiled and pressed against him, hugging his waist tightly.\u201cHusband, I miss you, did you miss me?\u201dLeft squeeze.Right squeeze.Mountains view.Down rubbing.Jiang Mu: \u201c\u2026\u201dIn order to conceive my seed and thus gain control of the entire Wuyou Sect.She is wonderful at seizing every opportunity and every moment to the fullest.Jiang Mu ordered without a refusal.\u201cLet go, I\u2019m going back to bed.\u201dHe had only come to see if there was anything unusual.If he messed around with her and made some kind of mess.It wouldn\u2019t be good.\u201cAw, okay\u2026\u2026.\u201dHan Yuqing was obedient and reluctantly let go of his hand.But just before letting go of the hand halfway.She whispered softly again into Jiang Mu\u2019s ear.Shyly, she said.\u201cHusband, I can stand upside down, upside down~~.\u201d????Jiang Mu didn\u2019t understand what she meant for a moment.Wasn\u2019t a handstand a normal exercise?But then he looked at the shy look in her eyes.He quickly understood.Good grief.It had only been two days, and she had already learned how to do this?I guess it wouldn\u2019t be long then.It wouldn\u2019t take long for her to get the hang of extreme pervert play. Ignoring time, and space, walking around, dancing, while talking about the scriptures\u2026She\u2019ll be able to do it all by herself.\u201cStanding upside down is good for your health, take your time.\u201dJiang Mu pushed her away and headed out.He remembered his diary reward for today, and hadn\u2019t read it yet.However, as he walked towards the door.A creepy laughter was heard from behind him.\u201cHeh heh heh\u2026\u201d????Jiang Mu subconsciously turned around to look.And saw Han Yuqing was slowly disappearing into the voidCrap! Jiang Mu felt in horror.His own neck was clamped by something long and slippery.Then.An 180-degree jolt came from the bottom\u2026\u2026\u2026The next day, early in the morning.The sunlight shone through the window and fell on a snow-white, scarred leg.Jiang Mu moved the leg away from his face.He gets off the table, then climbs to the top of the bookshelf and pulls down a long lake blue dress.Then he covered Han Yuqing\u2019s naked body on the table.\u201cHmmm\u2026 I couldn\u2019t resist the temptation of something new in the end.\u201d\u201cGot to reflect on that.\u201dLooking at the sweetly sleeping Han Yuqing, Jiang Mu silently reviewed his introspection.He noticed, Recently, he seemed to have indulged in a bit too much lust.He had actually had s*x with Black Water Fury and Han Yuqing consecutively in one day\u2026\u201cCould it be because of the \u2018goodly waist\u2019?\u201d\u201cIt must be it, the dog system purposely sent this reward to me, it must be to make me fall deeper into it and not be able to extricate myself!\u201dJiang Mu was at peace with himself, blaming the \u2018goodly waist\u2019, a useless reward, for his indulgence.\u201cOh yeah, I haven\u2019t read yesterday\u2019s diary reward yet.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hope for a kick-ass skill!\u201dJiang Mu couldn\u2019t wait to sit down on the chair.Opened the diary reward.Check it out.[Date: March 16th][Temperament +2 (26/100)][Face Value +2 (26/100)][Reward received: Finger Thunder (Immortal Technique)][Reward Description: Eat Master\u2019s Finger!

He saw a huge cave that was so red that it glowed.In the middle of the cave, there was also a huge white snake bone coiled up.\u201cFound it.\u201d Jiang Mu immediately cast out an immortal technique.\u201cExtreme Flash!\u201dA flash of light and his entire body disappeared from the bed.\u2026\u2026Savage Wilderness.The Blackwater Jedi, The North.Two miles below the red land, Inside the huge dark red cave.A light shone out of thin air.The light disappeared.Jiang Mu landed steadily on the ground.\u201cLittle cutie, here we are.\u201dHe spoke to the Space Ring, and a cloud of black mist impatiently burst from inside.It finally transformed into a little loli with golden pupils in a black dress and long black hair.Jiang Mu, meanwhile, looked around.He found that this so-called ancient tomb of the Snake God was just an ordinary cave that had been hollowed out.At the edge of the cave, there was a river of clear water.That was presumably the only exit.In the middle of the cave, a huge white snake bone was coiled up.It was about seven stories high.Jiang Mu followed the Black Water Fury and came together in front of the snake bone.\u201cLittle cutie, how are you going to pray for blessings?\u201dHe came with an interest.Only the protagonist group was eligible to participate in these large-scale Main story of the Blackwater Jedi.He, the villain, was not qualified to participate.\u201cMa-master \u2026.\u201dBlackwater Fury is still not used to calling Jiang Mu a master.But she didn\u2019t want Jiang Mu to know about her reason for summoning the Snake God, creating puppets.Therefore, she had to get used to it even if she didn\u2019t want to.\u201cMaster \u2026. Stay away, better stand at the edge of the cave, don\u2019t do anything, just wait.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dJiang Mu didn\u2019t have any suspicions.He walked to the edge of the cave, where there were many small rocky stones.He found a random stone to use as a stool and sat down, quietly watching the Black Water Fury\u2019s movements.He saw the Black Water Demon\u2019s palms spread out to the sides.Her mouth was chanting an obscure snake language and gradually.Behind the rocky hill at the edge of the cave, a group of water snakes emerged.Among them, there was a small black water snake.It crawled out from just below Jiang Mu\u2019s crotch, scaring the hell out of him.\u201cHoly sh*t, I thought there were no snakes here, but I didn\u2019t think there would be so many living here.\u201dJiang Mu was curious, looking at the water snakes that kept converging around the bone snake from all directions.It eventually converged into a large circle.The Black Water Fury\u2019s palms closed together.\u201cGo!\u201d A command was given.The group of snakes that had converged into a circle scrambled to quickly crawl towards the Bone Snake\u2019s torso while the snakes were crawling.The Black Water Fury grabbed in the void.With a precise grasp, she grabbed the only black water snake.Then strangling it alive, and throwing it at her feet.After the snakes had all crawled onto the snake bones.The Black Water Fury knelt down on one knee and slammed both palms over the ground.\u201cFall!\u201dHuzzah!A dark red dazzling aura, in the shape of a huge column, suddenly overlapped down from the top of the cave.It landed right on top of the huge bone snake, covering it completely.That red aura emitted tremendous pressure.Jiang Mu at the edge of the cave, felt a momentary suffocation.\u201cWhat a monster, no wonder she told me to stay away.\u201dJiang Mu used his spiritual power and was barely able to resist the oppressive pressure.On the contrary, the Black Water Fury.She was so close and nothing actually happened at all.\u201cAs expected of a Demon God realm, it\u2019s a far cry from a rookie of the Spirit Gathering realm like me.\u201dThe Black Water Fury stared at the huge red pillar in front of her.Inside there, the blood and flesh of the snakes were slowly seeping within the snake\u2019s bones.It didn\u2019t take long for the red aura to dissipate.The huge snake bones that were originally white.It was like it had been plated with a red color, becoming red and shiny.Black Water Fury\u2019s face looked happy.Inside this snake bone, the soul of an ancient snake god was sealed.She was going to unseal it, summon this soul, and then permanently seal the soul within that black water snake just now.Ultimately, create a permanent puppet to replace her and become Ling Aotian\u2019s master.And to create the puppet, four steps were needed.In the first step, a large amount of the water snake\u2019s flesh and blood were used to sacrifice to the snake\u2019s bone.The second step is to use the snake bones as a medium to briefly awaken the soul of the snake god within it.The third step was to transfer the snake god\u2019s soul and briefly attach it to the black water snake that had just been strangled to death.Step four, the final and most important step.Performing the forbidden art \u2018Serpent God Jidai\u2019 to permanently seal the Serpent God\u2019s soul within the black snake, and at the same time, erase, tamper with and implant memory fragments into the soul in order to make it into a puppet, resembling a second \u2018Black Water Fury\u2019.Perfect!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(Notes: feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart.)\u201cIs this the soul of the Ancient Serpent God?\u201d\u201cWhat a fierce killing aura!\u201dJiang Mu\u2019s heart palpitated until his body trembled, and cold sweat was already seeping out from his back.The Black Water Fury sensed Jiang Mu\u2019s predicament.With a small wave of her hand, she set up a spatial barrier for him, blocking out the murderous energy.\u201cPhew~ What a sweet little cutie I have.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have to reward her properly next time.\u201dJiang Mu breathed a sigh of relief.He sat down, and tuned in, watching Black Water Fury\u2019s prayers from afar.Black Water Fury narrowed her eyes and stared at the snake god without speaking.The snake god likewise stared at the Black Water Fury.He can sense it. (TL: Summoned soul)The little girl with golden pupils in front of him was the same as him, the same demon race \u2013 the Black Water Snake race.Moreover, it was also in the same state of soul.The cultivation realm was also the Demon God realm.When he saw that the Black Water Serpent was hesitant to speak, he took the initiative to ask.\u201cClansman, was it you who lifted the seal of this throne?\u201dThe voice was hoarse and cold. A man\u2019s voice.\u201cThat is correct.\u201dThe Black Water Fury returned, and then asked.\u201cYou, whose soul has been sealed for ten thousand years, do you want to be free again?\u201dFreedom \u2026.The Serpent God\u2019s gaze became dazed. Many of his memories had been lost due to the ban.But he could remember that his bones had been imprisoned here after he had been executed by his people. And that his soul, too, had been sealed in the bones by his people.So it has been \u2026. Sealed for ten thousand years \u2026..As time goes by, my memory disappears and my soul power is worn away \u2026.But I \u2026. I don\u2019t want to die here!He looked back at the Black Water FuryIn that case \u2026. Is she going to let me out?He suppressed the excitement within him and asked.\u201cClansman, you will help me to regain my freedom?\u201dThe Black Water Fury smiled grimly and said.\u201cYes!\u201dThe Serpent God hastened to ask.\u201cWhy?\u201dThe Black Water Fury answered with a domineering smile.\u201cI do as I please!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dThe Serpent God did not expect that this would be the reason.He exclaimed in admiration.\u201cMy Blackwater Serpent Clan, with the emergence of a clan member as outstanding as you, this one is deeply honoured.\u201d\u201cIn the future, if you and I join forces, we will definitely lead my Blackwater Serpent Clan to regain the top position among the barbaric demon clans!\u201d\u201cOr even unify the human and demon clans and stand proud atop of this World!\u201dThe Blackwater Serpent narrowed his eyes and returned.\u201cI accept your wise words.\u201dThen, pointing to the dead black water snake on the ground, he said.\u201cOnce inside, you will be free for now, will you go in on your own, or will this god have to help you out?\u201dThe snake god\u2019s gaze, directed at the ordinary black water snake, said with dissatisfaction.\u201cI\u2019m a Demon God.\u201d\u201cTen thousand years ago I was even the head of a clan, and you let me possess a dead, ruined snake?\u201cMy soul cannot stay away from the bones of the snake bone, so I go and find a living snake vessel.\u201d\u201cThat way my throne\u2019s power will not be diminished too much after possessing a living snake\u201dThe Black Water Fury flatly refused, saying.\u201cAnyway, there are formations inside this cave, so you can\u2019t stay possessed for long, but when you get out, can\u2019t you get a new vessel?\u201dThe Serpent God replied reluctantly.\u201cAll right, but you must stay away from it, as the process of possessing me will generate a powerful soul force that may hurt you.\u201dThe corners of Black Water Fury\u2019s mouth hooked slightly as he said.\u201cFine.\u201d She knew that this Snake God, on the surface, looked amiable.In reality, he was a treacherous, selfish and self-serving beast who mutilated and ate his people.Therefore, he would definitely flee after his possession.The Black Water Fury also did not expose him.Instead, she backed away from the dead snake on the ground, as he had wished.Giving him the chance to escape.When the snake god looked at it, a flash of joy flashed in his eyes.His huge soul immediately transformed into a black mist.The black mist penetrated down into the corpse of that black snake.Gradually, the black snake corpse squirmed and slowly transformed.Eventually, the original dead black snake was changed into a little boy in black with disheveled hair and golden pupils.As soon as the little boy took shape, he immediately cast a spatial spirit technique and escaped from the cave with a vanish.And without forgetting to mock the Black Water Fury.\u201cWhat an idiotic fool.\u201d\u201cCalling you a clansman twice, and you take it seriously?\u201d\u201cThe so-called clansmen are just nourishment to grow my own power.\u201d\u201cWhen I regain my peak strength, I will devour your soul!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure that your soul will be delicious and nourishing! Hahaha\u201dHis body instantly disappeared into the void.However, In the next second.His entire body was ejected from the void, and he was thrown out.The Black Water Fury sneered and said.\u201cThis cave has long been imprisoned by a formation with many restrictions, so it is simply impossible to escape out using spatial spirit techniques.\u201d\u201cNo \u2026. S-spatial spirit techniques to escape?\u201dThe little boy\u2019s face was horrified.He was also horrified to see that the Black Water Fury had already disappeared into the void and flashed over.The Black Water Fury raised her fist, which was covered in spatial ripples, and formed a fist of armor.It smashed hard towards his face.The young boy could not retreat and was compelled to strike with the same fist.Boom!The little boy was no match and was sent flying backwards, landing heavily on the ground.\u201cPoof!\u201d He was so hurt that he spat out a mouthful of blood.Jiang Mu looking at this scene from afar, was dumbfounded.\u201cCrap? What the hell!\u201d\u201cThat Snake God\u2026 Turned into a little boy?\u201d\u201cThe little cutie even beat him up and puked blood?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of blessing is she praying for!\u201dJiang Mu felt like an idoit.It was obvious that Black Water Fury had tricked him.His lustful authority as a master had been seriously defied!\u201cDamn it, how dare you cheat your master? Rebelling are you?\u201d\u201cWhen we get back, I\u2019ll make sure to punish her severely! Make her do an upside-down style!\u201dInside the battlefield.Black Water Fury eventually punched the little boy away.\u201cArgh!\u201dThe little boy fell heavily and spat out another mouthful of blood.He scrambled to his feet and begged for mercy:.\u201cStop\u2026 Stop! I surrender! I am willing to be under your command!\u201dYet the Black Water Fury did not stop.She once again spatially dodged and flashed in front of the little boy.Then five fingers grabbed in the empty space.The little boy\u2019s throat was just grabbed by her in the air, and his whole body was grabbed off the ground.The Black Water Fury stared at him and laughed ruthlessly, saying\u201cA demon god of the Ancient Black Water Snake Clan?\u201cNothing more than a brute that mutilates and eats its people.\u201cSince you are restless and want to escape, I will first make you unconscious.\u201cAnd finally, let\u2019s turn you into a permanent puppet.\u201dPermanent\u2026 A permanent puppet?Wait! Could it be\u2026.Is she going to cast me \u2026. Serpent God Jidai?!The little boy\u2019s heart rejoiced as he thought of a perfect plan!So, he simply gave up resistance.Eventually, due to a lack of oxygen, he passed out.Seeing this. Black Water Fury then threw him to the ground.She turned her head to look at Jiang Mu\u2019s side.Finding Jiang Mu staring straight at her.This made her feel weak for a moment, and she immediately turned her head away, not daring to look again.\u201cHe knows that this god has tricked him!\u201dThrough the master-servant relationship, the Black Water Fury could sense Jiang Mu\u2019s will.It was probably saying,\u00a0\u2018How dare you lie to me? Be prepared for your punishment upside-down style, when we return!\u2019The Black Water Fury felt an inexplicable shrinking somewhere.Her legs could not help but tremble a little.Through Jiang Mu\u2019s will, she had seen this image of something flying upside down.Ugh! So immoral!!!Shaking her head off, the Black Water Fury quickly recovered.She looked at the unconscious little boy on the ground.\u201cIt\u2019s not too late.\u201d\u201cGotta hurry up and make this snake god, a puppet!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Like she\u2019s getting older?\u201dLooking at Black Water Fury\u2019s white-haired, leathery appearance.Jiang Mu was really shocked.\u201cDamn it! She must be plotting something to keep me out of it!\u201dJiang Mu wanted to rush over and teach her a lesson, to teach her to know how to respect her master and be honest with him.But he was being separated by a spatial barrier and could not get out at all.So he could only call out to Black Water Fury.\u201cOpen the barrier now! I want to come to your place!\u201dHowever, the Black Water Fury, who was in the midst of casting a forbidden spell, could not be distracted from anything else.She changed her seal.\u201cArise!\u201dThe little boy\u2019s body, then, floated out of the snake god\u2019s soul.Then, stretching out, her withered and dried three fingers and pointed at the snake\u2019s soul.\u201cGo!\u201dAt the tips of the three fingers, three lines of red, white and green were drilled out, respectively.Those were the lines that represented memory deletion, memory tampering, and memory implantation, respectively.The three memory threads were inserted into the snake soul\u2019s skull.She carefully perceived all the memories of the snake soul and used her own soul power to mark and classify them.Then, using her soul\u2019s power to manipulate the red thread, she deleted the vast majority of the Snake Soul\u2019s memories, such as mutilating the clan, being executed by the clan, and having his soul sealed.Then manipulate the white thread to tamper with a portion of the memories, such as tampering with the memories of the Blackwater Fury from past years, the Blackwater Fury\u2019s personality hobbies, behavioural habits, etc.The green thread is then manipulated to falsify strong memories out of thin air for implantation.These implanted memories include but are not limited to: not to kill Black Water Fury and Jiang Mu, not to kill Han Yuqing and Ding Nanrong, to assist in teaching Ling Aotian, to be submissive and protect Ling Aotian, and must self-sacrifice to make Ling Aotian strong and whole, etc.She also, incidentally, gave the snake spirit a new name: theBlack Water Seat.After half an hour of manipulation.Black Water Fury finally made the little boy, successfully creating a second \u2018Black Water Fury\u2019!\u201cGreat success!!!\u201dThe Black Water Fury was so excited.Looking at the unconscious little boy, she was so excited that she could not help but let out a wild laugh.\u201cHahahahahaha!!!\u201d\u201cThis God, has changed the heavens against fate!!!\u201d\u201cHahahahahahahahahahahaha!!\u201dAfter the cathartic laughter.She carefully analyzed the situation in her mind, to see if there was any major problem.After the analysis, the only one problem was gender.\u201cThe soul of this ancient serpent god, is male.\u201d\u201cSo the Serpent God Era can only create a male \u2018Black Water Fury\u2019.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s no harm in that.\u201d\u201cBecause the bastard\u2019s diary says so.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a harem but pure, master-disciple relationship line between the \u2018Black Water Fury\u2019 and Intimate relation was banned by a officials from above halfway through.\u201d\u201cSo, the master and disciple duo, are not going to have any intimate contact.\u201d\u201cWhich means that this issue of gender is almost negligible.\u201dBlack Water Fury was not worried at all about whether Black Water Seat was male or female.It couldn\u2019t be that Blackwater Seat would be forcefully defeated by Ling Aotian, right?Besides, it was useless to worry about it.If she wanted to create a second \u2018Blackwater Fury\u2019, then the cultivation realm of this \u2018Blackwater Fury\u2019 had to be at the same Demon God realm as she was.And in the entire Black Water Snake Clan, the only surviving Demon God Realm was her and the Ancient Snake God.And since the Ancient Serpent God\u2019s soul was male.So only the male \u2018Black Water Fury\u2019 could be created, which was the current Black Water Seat.The Black Water Fury scanned the small, cloaked, petite, black-clad boy on the ground.\u201cNext, It\u2019s time to have Black Water Seat, instead of myself, return to Ling Aotian\u2019s side!\u201dShe could not wait to go back to the ruined ancient city within the Lingyin Kingdom right now, immediately, and shove the Black Water Seat to Ling Aotian.She turned to look at Jiang Mu, showing a sincere smile from her heart.She was very happy.It was true happiness to have resolved a major concern on her mind.So happy that she couldn\u2019t help but shout out.\u201cMaster! Release!\u201dShe released the spatial barrier that was blocking Jiang Mu.????Jiang Mu was stunned, thinking he had heard it wrong.\u201cShe seemed so happy just now \u2026.. calling me master?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t she resist it?\u201d\u201cHow come after turning into this white-haired, leathery ghostly look, her nature has changed like a different person?\u201d\u201cCould it be that she\u2019s addicted to sex and is afraid I\u2019ll abandon her?\u201dWith doubts, Jiang Mu walked towards Black Water Fury.The Black Water Fury grinned and her eyes looked closely at Jiang Mu.I don\u2019t know if it was because of the successful creation of the Black Water Seat, or because of the addiction with Jiang in the past two days.Or maybe it was both.So much so that she was now, eager to be punished severely by Jiang Mu.\u201cMaster, come and punish me!\u201dThe Black Water Fury stood in place and opened a pair of skin and bone-withered hands.Gave a naughty smile, she waited for Jiang Mu to come and take her upside down.However, instead, she saw that Jiang Mu\u2019s face suddenly turned fearful.That fear, as if he \u2026. Was about to lose something precious.This made the Black Water Fury\u2019s smile, disappear gradually.\u201cI see, he doesn\u2019t want\u2026 Wasted me anymore?\u201d\u201cHe really is \u2026.\u201d\u201cDisgusted with me!\u201dBlackwater Fury narrowed her golden pupils and dropped her withered hands.It could have been an illusion; her heart felt a slight pain.\u201cRidiculous!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way, I-I am\u2014\u201dShe didn\u2019t know who she was cursing, and her dry fists clenched slightly as her face turned ugly.Jiang Mu\u2019s expression, however, became even more fearful.And he rushed forward.As he rushed, he shouted in panic\u201cRun, little cutie!!! Run!!!\u201dRun \u2026.?Blackwater Fury\u2019s gaze was suddenly confused.Why? Is he disgusted with me so much, that \u2026. telling me to get lost?It might have been an illusion again, her heart felt a stabbing pain.Then, suddenly, at the same time, from behind her came a, ruthlessly cold, hoarse voice was heard.\u201cDie for this seat! Snake God Poisonous Water Fist!!!\u201dBanggg!Her abdomen was pierced from behind by a hand entwined with a black water viper.\u201cArghhhhhhh\u2026!!\u201dShe screamed in pain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cough!\u201dShe spat out a large mouthful of blood and followed with a heavy kick to the back, and was sent flying violently.She happened to fly towards Jiang Mu, who was running in front of her.\u201cLittle cutie!!!\u201d Jiang Mu safely caught her in his arms.Only after backing up the distance to cushion her for a while did he place her on the ground.A quick look revealed that she had a bloody hole pierced in her abdomen.Around the edge of the bloody hole, there were also four dark golden pupil water snakes attached.\u201cThis snake \u2026. is Black Water Poison!\u201dJiang Mu\u2019s face was grave.He recognized at a glance that it was a snake transformed from Black Water Poison, and it was still very powerful!The four snakes had now turned into poisonous water, seeping in and eroding the Black Water Fury\u2019s body.\u201cLittle cutie, hurry up and suppress and purify that Black Water Poison, I\u2019ll take you away right now!\u201dAlthough he didn\u2019t know what was going on, but one with discerning eyes could see.That little boy in black, who was transformed by an ancient snake god, was trying to kill the Black Water Fury!Jiang Mu was wary of the little boy in the distance.Seeing him cloaked, his petite body was walking east and west towards this side step by step.As he walked, he suddenly lost his footing and fell to the ground.Then he got up again and continued walking.He didn\u2019t take two steps before falling down again.He seems to be very uncomfortable with his body.The whole time he was wearing a ruthless smile, and his golden pupils were fixed on the Black Water Fury in Jiang Mu\u2019s arms.The insidious words that kept coming out of his mouth were.\u201cThis seat kills you \u2026. Kill you \u2026. Kill you \u2026.\u201dIt gave Jiang Mu a bad chill to look at.\u201cThis little boy gives off a feeling, why is he so much like \u2026. the evil version of Black Water Fury?\u201d\u201cDamn, no matter what kind of bullshit ancient snake god you are, I\u2019ll definitely kill you later!\u201dJiang Mu was furious.His woman had almost been killed in front of him.He hated to skin that little boy alive.However, his cultivation is at only a Spirit Gathering Mirror, so he couldn\u2019t fight at all, but instead use Extreme Flash and flee in an instant.And just as he was about to use Extreme Flash.The Black Water Fury in his arms grabbed his hand and said weakly.\u201cWait \u2026. You can\u2019t just leave like this \u2026.\u201dAs she said that, she borrowed Jiang Mu\u2019s shoulder to stand up.However, due to her injuries, coupled with the fact that she had already consumed a large amount of spiritual power, soul power, and a depreciated life span.As a result, she was now extremely weak.So weak that she could barely heal the bloody hole in her abdomen, and barely suppress the Black Water Poison that was spreading and eroding in her body slowly.Jiang Mu frowned.She was so ailing and near death, could she defeat her opponent?If she didn\u2019t run, she might as well die!So he said, not to be denied.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re hiding from me, though, but I can sense that you are very weak now, so weak that you can barely defeat me.\u201d\u201cEven if we combined, we wouldn\u2019t be able to beat him.\u201d\u201cWhatever the reason, I will avenge you later, but for now, we must leave!\u201dSeeing how determined Jiang Mu was, the Black Water Fury\u2019s face suddenly became alarmed: \u201cNo\u2026\u201cNo\u2026 No!\u201dHer original plan was to request Jiang Mu once she had successfully created the Black Water Seat, and bring it back with her.But now. Black Water Seat, which was supposed to be sleeping for two days, had actually woken up unexpectedly early.He even sneakily attacked her after waking up.Could it be that the Serpent God Jidai\u2026. Failed?If it really failed, then everything she had done would be meaningless!Black Water Fury was terrified. She looked closely at Jiang Mu and pleaded.\u201cDon\u2019t go yet, give me some time, I have to figure out one thing!\u201dShe had to know if the Serpent God Jidai, had succeeded or not.Jiang Mu\u2019s brow came together deeper as he looked at the young boy in the distance.Finding him stopped in its tracks, it fell to the ground.With a painful face, he clutched his head and rolled around, hissing \u201caaaaaaah\u201d and screaming.In other words, the two of them were safe for now.He promised Black Water Fury.\u201cOkay, but as soon as there is danger, I will take you away in an instant!\u201d\u201cThank you, Master!\u201dThe Black Water Fury\u2019s joy was overwhelming, she said hurriedly.\u201cMaster, carry me on your back so I can see the state of the Blackwater Seat!\u201dBlackwater Seat?That was the little boy\u2019s name, wasn\u2019t it?Jiang Mu knew it in his heart.He picked up Black Water Fury on his back.So that she could easily observe Blackwater Seat, who was rolling and screaming with a clutching head in the distance.Black Water Fury watched carefully.Her mind was running at breakneck speed, thinking, and analyzing.She knew that the Blackwater Seat, who had been made into a puppet, was required to undergo two days of slumber while the soul and physical body were being bonded.But now, he had woken up early.So, did she succeed or not? Thinking about it.She thought of a way to verify it.Then she said to Jiang Mu.\u201cMaster, can you attack him? Just a few random long-range attacks would be fine.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d Jiang Mu didn\u2019t ask why. Instead, he just raised his index finger.CREEEKKK\u2026!The tip of his finger sparked purple lightning, emitting a loud sound like a thousand birds chirping in unison.\u201cFinger Thunder!\u201dA purple thunderbolt shot out from the tip of his finger.The thunderbolt shot at the position of Blackwater Seat\u2019s abdomen.But it was blocked by a spatial barrier.Jiang Mu continued to shoot out lightning and attacked several times in succession.The lightning was all blocked by the spatial barrier, unable to harm the Blackwater Seat.\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is!\u201dBlackwater Fury came to a sudden realization.She understood.The Serpent God Jidai, had succeeded!But it also didn\u2019t succeed completely!There were three reasons for this.The first point was that the reason Blackwater Seat had fallen into a state of rolling and screaming holding his head was because he had awakened early, causing his soul to not have enough time to adapt to his physical body, so much so that it was now gradually beginning to grind its soul against its physical body, creating great pain.The second point is that when Jiang Mu attacked, it was blocked by the spatial barriers around the Blackwater Seat.Those spatial barriers, which were naturally created after the success of the Serpent God\u2019s Jidai, served to protect the life of the puppet until its soul and flesh had merged before disappearing on their own.On the third point, she had implanted a memory on Blackwater Seat: she must not kill Blackwater Fury and Jiang Mu.But as soon as Blackwater Seat woke up, he attacked and tried to kill her.In other words, Blackwater Seat, surprisingly, still possessed his own memories!This reminded Black Water Fury of a secret.This forbidden art, the Serpent God Jidai, was not insurmountable!But the only person who could break this forbidden art was only one person.That is the \u2026. Founder of this forbidden art!The Black Water Fury\u2019s face gradually turned white.She had counted on a thousand things, but she had not been able to calculate.The puppet she had made \u2026. This Ancient Serpent God \u2026.. Was actually the \u2026. Founder of the forbidden art of the \u2018Serpent God Jidai\u2019?!In other words, Her Puppet Project \u2026. Completely \u2026. Failed \u2026.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dJiang Mu sensed the Black Water Fury behind her and became in a bad mood.\u201cI \u2026. I\u2019m not willing!\u201dBlack Water Fury gripped Jiang Mu\u2019s shoulder tightly, teeth clenched as his gaze stared deadly at Black Water Seat, holding his head and rolling in the distance.After all the efforts she had made!But in the end \u2026. But in the end, it was all for nothing!Could \u2026. My end \u2026. I\u2019m destined to sacrifice myself for Ling Aotian?I am not willing! I hate it.!The Black Water Fury was angry and resigned, and yet she felt frightened at the same time.She asked Jiang Mu in a trembling voice.\u201cMaster \u2026. Will you \u2026. kill me? \u2026.\u201dShe knew that Jiang Mu would definitely follow the plot.Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have gone back to the trouble of entering the Lingyin Kingdom to approach Ling Aotian, desperately trying to restore the plot\u2019s outcome.In other words, Jiang Mu will eventually order her Black Water Fury \u2026. sacrifice for the sake of making Ling Aotian a success!\u201cWhat he hell, did you go crazy?\u201dJiang Mu was speechless at all times. She still had the heart to joke.Black Water Fury was stunned.Although, she had been scolded, and yet she didn\u2019t feel angry at all.On the contrary, she even felt a little \u2026. Happy?That\u2019s right, happy!So happy that she couldn\u2019t resist asking again.\u201cMaster \u2026. Would you kill me, if you ever had to achieve some goal \u2026. and let me die?\u201d\u201cFool, you are my woman, selling women, I don\u2019t do it, if you ask such a stupid question in the future, ask it once, I will punish you.\u201dJiang Mu was truly speechless.Because of the master-servant relationship, he was able to sense Black Water Fury\u2019s true emotions.He sensed that Black Water Fury was truly afraid that he would kill her.And similarly, Black Water Fury could also sense that Jiang Mu was being sincere when he said those words.He was truly not going to kill her.This made her happy, very happy, tremendously so.Enough happiness that she couldn\u2019t help but spit out her long, and drill it into Jiang Mu\u2019s mouth.A back and forth* kiss.\u201cMmmmmmmmmmm!\u201d\u201cF*ck! What are you messing with, wait until we get back!\u201dJiang Mu was utterly speechless at her.She was so out of character today.Did snakes also have a mating period?\u201cMaster! I\u2019m going to tell you what I\u2019ve done today \u2026. Tell you everything!\u201dThe Black Water Fury decided to be honest.Since the plan to make a puppet had failed.Then there was no need for her to hide what had happened today.Besides, sooner or later, Jiang Mu would get to the bottom of it for her.So she simply told the whole story on her own.This would, at least, leave a good impression on Jiang Mu.As for whether she would be ordered by Jiang Mu to sacrifice herself to make Ling Aotian whole?She didn\u2019t know, but knew now that Jiang Mu, would not kill her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now come up with some Blackwater Seat thing that almost killed herself in return.She really is \u2026. Not cute and obedient at all!Jiang Mu glanced sideways at the Black Water Fury and was furious:\u201cYou should have told me from the start, coming to this shitty ancient tomb, how dare you lie to me about praying for blessings?\u201d\u201cThe hell you did and now you\u2019ve created the Black Water Seat, which almost killed you.\u201d\u201cDo you still see me as your master in your eyes? no matter what your reasons are.\u201dWhen you get back, you better be prepared!\u201dHis voice sounded angry and full of distress.Looking at Blackwater Fury, who didn\u2019t feel scared.Instead, she felt relaxed, even pleasant.So much so that she couldn\u2019t help but grin, revealing her white teeth.She wrapped her arms around Jiang Mu\u2019s neck, her small mouth close to Jiang Mu\u2019s ear.It was then that she spelled out her reasons for doing what she did today, all of which were.\u201cMaster, you know that I am Ling Aotian\u2019s master, right?\u201d\u201cIn fact, from the moment I became your woman, I was destined to be inseparable from you and I can no longer go back to Ling Aotian\u2019s side and continue to be in your side, Master.\u201d\u201cSo I want to create a permanent puppet to replace me and become Ling Aotian\u2019s master teacher.\u201d\u201cSo that Ling Aotian can \u2026..\u201dThe Black Water Fury suddenly lost her voice.She was going to say, \u2018so that Ling Aotian could successfully go through the plot\u2019.The words ended up in her mouth, and her voice was eliminated by an unknown power.So, finding a suitable reason, she continued.\u201cSo that Ling Aotian can become stronger, because I had promised Ling Aotian that I would guide him in his cultivation and would help him achieve his purpose.\u201d\u201cHe had also promised me that he would, in turn, help me achieve my purpose.\u201d\u201cAnd out of the friendship between master and disciple, it was not good for me to break my promise.\u201d\u201cSo, I came here to the Serpent God\u2019s Tomb to make puppet.\u201d\u201cBut I was afraid that you would not agree, so I hid it from you and said that I had come to pray for blessings.\u201dThe Black Water Fury finished by saying this.And continued to tell the process of using the \u2018Serpent God Jidai\u2019 to create the puppet, the Black Water 2, and the result of the failed creation.It was all detailed out.All the way to the current situation.After listening, Jiang Mu pondered.Black Water Fury looked nervously at the side of his face.Her withered hands, which were wrapped around his neck, subconsciously tightened a bit.I don\u2019t know why, but she was a bit afraid.Afraid that Jiang Mu would be angry with her.This is really \u2026. A strange feeling \u2026.If it was someone else, who would have dared to be angry with her Black Water Fury?She would have just slapped them.After Jiang Mu finished contemplating.Suddenly, his eyes lit up. He looked at the distant Black Water seat, who was rolling on the ground holding his head.Hastily confirming, he asked Black Water Fury.\u201cLittle cutie, you just said that that guy \u2026. is not a puppet because he still retains some of his own memories?\u201dBlack Water Fury nodded back.\u201cYes, It was because of his own memories that he secretly retained that suppressed the memories I had implanted.\u201d\u201cSo. He will live according to that part of his own memories and is not considered a puppet.\u201dJiang Mu pursued.\u201cIf, say, you perform another \u2018Serpent God Jidai\u2019, can that delete \u2026. that part of his memory that he secretly kept?\u201dDelete the memory?Black Water Fury understood what Jiang Mu meant.The answer was yes.As long as the memory that was secretly kept by Black Water Fury 2 was deleted.Then the memories that she had implanted would dominate.Then Black Water Fury 2 would completely become a puppet.In fact, that part of his memory was retained through the \u2018Serpent God Sealed Memory\u2019.\u2018Serpent God Sealed Memories\u2019, a one-time trigger-type minor art, only works against \u201dSerpent God Jidai\u2019 art\u2019.When one is struck by \u2018Snake God Jidai\u2019.\u2018Serpent God Sealed Memory\u2019 will activate on its own and will seal the memories of the most recent period on its own.Thereafter, after the \u2018Serpent God Jidai\u2019 is finished, that part of the memory that was sealed will resurface and take over.In other words, as long as the Black Water Fury used \u2018Serpent God Jidai\u2019 on the Black Water seat once more and deleted that part of memory again.Then, he would become a puppet completely.But Blackwater Fury knew that.She could no longer perform the \u2018Serpent God Jidai\u2019. Because her life span, was not enough!So with a sigh, filled with regret, she said to Jiang Mu.\u201cIf I perform the Serpent God Jidai once more\u2026.\u201cThat would indeed make him a complete puppet, ut my life expectancy \u2026. Only 400 years left!\u201d\u201cAnd if I want to perform another attempt, I\u2019ll need to spend 997 years!\u201d\u201cSo \u2026. I can\u2019t do it.\u201dWhen Jiang Mu heard this, he did not feel sorry.On the contrary, he was excited and said.\u201cAs long as I can delete it, that\u2019s fine! It doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t cast it!\u201dThen he told her the method he had thought of.\u201cListen up, sweetie, I have a way.\u201d\u201cA way to turn him into a complete puppet!\u201d\u201cIf you imprison or stun him, I can do it, Can you do that?\u201dImprison or stun?Black Water Fury frowned intensely.She looked into the distance, the Blackwater Seat, who was still rolling around.Judging from Blackwater Seat\u2019s sneak attack on her just now, his power was probably only around the ninth level of the Qi Sea realm.Then, unless she, Black Water Fury, could also exert the power of the ninth level of Qi Sea Realm.Otherwise. She couldn\u2019t hold him back at all, so helplessly, she said to Jiang Mu.\u201cHis current power is around the ninth level of the Qi Sea realm.\u201d\u201cUnless I can also exert the power of the ninth level of the Qi Sea realm.\u201d\u201cThere is no way I can hold him, let alone imprison him, or knock him out.\u201d\u201cAnd in this weakened state of mine now and the power I can exert \u2026.\u201d\u201cAt most, it\u2019s only the first layer of the Qi Hai realm!\u201dA Qi Hai realm? Nine layers?Thankfully okay!As long as there wasn\u2019t a big realm difference, then there was no problem!Jiang Mu revealed a smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s 10 minutes.That would be enough!Without delay, Jiang Mu lowered the Black Water Fury off his back.Then, turning around and squatting down, he looked at her levelly and said\u201cI have a spiritual technique called Spiritual Stimulation.\u201cThis spiritual art can stimulate the spiritual energy in your body, allowing you to gain extreme power.\u201cThat is, to take you from the first level of the Qi Sea realm, to the ninth level, but before I can perform this spiritual technique on you.\u201cI need to transfer one of your spirit arts, to me!\u201dTransfer the spirit art\u2026 Transfer it?There\u2019s such a means?!Black Water Fury\u2019s eyes widened, as if she had heard something ridiculous beyond belief.Yet, she didn\u2019t have the slightest doubt.For, she believed in Jiang Mu and asked.\u201cWhich technique do you want to transfer me?\u201dJiang Mu smiled faintly and said with certainty.\u201cThe forbidden art, Serpent God Jidai!\u201dSnake God Jidai\u2026Black Water Fury\u2019s face was stony.She had already guessed the method Jiang Mu was talking about.\u201cYour method is that you cast the Serpent God Jidai on him while I hold him captive, erasing that part of his memory?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s the only way!\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dThe Black Water Fury rejected it without even thinking about it.The Serpent God Jidai needed to double its life expectancy and reduce its life expectancy by half.Jiang Mu was in his twenties.And with the Gathering Spirit Mirror, his life expectancy limit was currently only 100 years.If he cast the Serpent God Jidai.Then he would need to overdraw more than 20 years of his life span and shrink his life span limit by 50 years.Then he would end up \u2026. Only a few years of life left!What a difference between that and suicide?\u201cCutie, are you worried about me?\u201dJiang Mu felt moved.Black Water Fury\u2019s persona was of the ruthless, vengeful, vindictive, kill-if-you-don\u2019t-please, selfish type.But judging from her decisive denial of his casting of the Snake God Jidai.With that tone of voice, she was clearly worried about him.This sense of contrast was strong enough.\u201cSo what if I am! This God always does as I please!\u201dThe Black Water Fury narrowed her big golden eyes and stared at Jiang Mu with a fierce glare.Only her ears, a bit hot.Her little heart also had a \u2026. beating like it had never been before.Shame!It must be the master-servant relationship doing this!This is never what the gods really meant!!!\u201cHaha, you\u2019re a real cutie.\u201dJiang Mu couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud.He reached out and caressed Black Water Fury\u2019s little face.It was probably because of the master-servant relationship, plus the fact that the two of them had already *cough* done it a dozen times.So that the emotional relationship between the two of them was now connected very closely.The truth of Black Water Fury\u2019s affection was something that Jiang Mu could definitely sense.Looking at her with this fierce but worried look.Jiang Mu suddenly wanted to tease her.So Jiang Mu raised his mouth and slowly approached her forehead.The Black Water Fury\u2019s ears burned a little more at Jiang Mu\u2019s sudden move.The strange beating of her heart also intensified.Chu~!Jiang Mu finally gave her a fierce kiss on the forehead.Then, cupping her face, he said.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t need to consume my life span because, I can use the Snake God Jidai unconditionally!\u201dHe also, incidentally, told her about depriving her of the \u2018Black Water Soul Etching Technique\u2019 before, and finally turning her into a slave.All of it was said one by one.Black Water Fury didn\u2019t know exactly what she had listened to.From the moment Jiang Mu slowly kissed her forehead.She had felt a little dizzy and her breathing was a little disordered.This feeling \u2026. It was just very sudden and wonderful.It was really \u2026. The all-important master-servant relationship!Shame on you!Immoral!!!\u201cCutie? Cutie? Did you get it, silly?\u201dJiang Mu saw her sudden disoriented look and comforted her with concern.\u201cHuh? Oh, listen\u2026 I understand.\u201dBlack Water Fury hastily snapped back to her senses.She stroked her non-existent chest and calmed her breathing.Then she recalled what Jiang Mu had just said.It turned out.Jiang Mu had previously deprived and transferred her \u2018Black Water Soul Etching Technique\u2019 to himself through that whatever \u2018Art of Extreme Dao Shift\u2019.In the end.He then unconditionally, cast the \u2018Black Water Soul Etching Technique\u2019 on her, turning her into a loyal slave.If she had known about this from the beginning, she would probably have gone berserk and exploded on the spot.But now? She had a feeling of \u201cthis is good too\u201d \u2026. Wonderful feeling.\u201cCutie stop spacing around, are you ready?, I\u2019m going to start transferring your spiritual arts.\u201dJiang Mu slapped her face lightly.Black Water Fury nodded.She looked off into the distance.That Black Water Seat was still rolling around holding its head, but it was just not as intense anymore.Then she immediately said.\u201cReady!\u201dAnd Jiang Mu placed his palm over her forehead.Casting out an immortal technique.\u201cThe Art of Extreme Dao Shift!\u201dBuzz!Jiang Mu\u2019s palm emitted a brilliant arcane light.At the same time.In his mind\u2019s eye.An interface about Blackwater Fury\u2019s [Abilities], [Spiritual Arts], [Immortal Arts], and [Physique] appeared.[Character]: Blackwater Fury\u3010Ability\u3011\uff1aHuman Language, Spiritual Pressure, Skin Residing, Gnosis \u2026.

Within his dantian, a red \u2018Essence Blood Pill\u2019 coalesced.He did not catalyze the Essence Blood Pill.Instead, he prepared to drain it out and give it to Black Water Fury to swallow.Only to find that the Essence Blood Pill could not pass straight out of his stomach.It ran upwards.It went to the chest, made its way to the esophagus (throat), and was about to make its way to the mouth.Immediately, Jiang Mu held Black Water Fury\u2019s face, signaling her to open her mouth quickly.Black Water Fury\u2019s ears burned twice more and immediately opened her mouth.Jiang Mu immediately closed it.The Black Water Fury \u201cMmm!\u201d A sound was heard.The red Essence Blood Pill passed from Jiang Mu\u2019s mouth into her mouth.Subconsciously, she wrapped her arms tightly around Jiang Mu\u2019s neck and swallowed it.The Essence Blood Pill began to pass into her throat and across her chest.Finally, it entered her dantian.Boom!!!Under the urging of the Essence Blood Pill.The spiritual energy within the Black Water Fury\u2019s entire Dantian was like a volcanic eruption.It surged and sent spurts to all corners of her body.Her body, instantly, erupted with a blue aura visible to the naked eye.This aura vaporised furiously.It steamed her skirt and hair.She looked like a berserker, white-haired, withered little loli.Chu~! The mouth parted.\u201cWhat a powerful spiritual technique!\u201dBlackwater Fury felt the condition of her body.\u201cThe power within my body is coming up in a steady stream!\u201d\u201cIt has already reached the ninth level of the Qi Sea realm!\u201dShe took an internal look.Finding that there was nothing different about her body.In other words.This spiritual technique of Jiang Mu has no side effects at all!It was truly\u2026 Unbelievable!At this moment.The distant Black Water Seat was no longer rolling around clutching his head.He slowly stood up.Those golden pupils stared at Blackwater Fury and Jiang Mu with eerie coldness.A seeping, hostile laugh also came out of his mouth.\u201cKill you\u2026 Kill you\u2026 Kill you!!!\u201dHe suddenly rushed forward with a sudden outburst.A fist ruthlessly struck Jiang Mu\u2019s back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was very conservative in her thinking and could not let go of intimacy in front of others.From the point of view of Nanzhu\u2019s state of mind at this moment, when Xing\u2019er suddenly appeared, her state of mind was probably similar to that of \u201cgoing shopping with her boyfriend, but suddenly meeting her parents who were also shopping\u201d.Subconsciously, she pretends that she doesn\u2019t know her boyfriend well and that she is not close to him.Taking advantage of the fact that Xing\u2019er hadn\u2019t arrived yet, He Yunxiao used this gap to come closer to Nanzhu\u2019s side.\u201cNanzhu, I want to \u2018heal\u2019 now.\u201dMeng Qingrou naturally knew what \u201chealing\u201d meant, it meant that the big hand and the small hand interlocked their fingers and pressed tightly together.It is obvious that yesterday she was angry with him, but today she was pulled by his, hand, spanked, and kissed on the forehead\u2026\u2026.At the very beginning, Meng Qingrou was planning to never forgive He Yunxiao again, but now, for some reason, it has turned into the pattern of being with him as before. Although now he does not take the initiative to move his hands and feet on himself, Meng Qingrou feels that this way now, it is even a little more intimate than in the old days.Meng Qingrou pushed He Yunxiao\u2019s arm with her small hand, but of course she couldn\u2019t push it. She just meant it, and then said, \u201cGo back and sit down, Xing\u2019er is here.\u201dOf course, He Yunxiao knew that it was Xing\u2019er who was coming. If Xing\u2019er didn\u2019t come, he wouldn\u2019t have the heart to tease Nanzhu.Nanzhu was in the most adorable state of mind, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be laughed at by Xing\u2019er\u201d.He put his big hand under Nanzhu\u2019s small hand, which was naturally hanging at her side, and rubbed the tips of her fingers with his palm upwards. At the same time, he did not forget to whisper 'sneaky words\u201d in Nanzhu\u2019s ear.\u201cNanzhu, I want to \u2018heal my wounds\u2019, will you let me heal my wounds for a while?\u201dMeng Qingrou\u2019s fingers tickled and her heart tickled too.The past came to mind, and the warmth, comfort and solidity of the small hand being wrapped in the big one came together.Meng Qingrou\u2019s five green and jade fingers, which were still close together, now began to move a little bit one by one, a little bit away from the other fingers.Seeing Nanzhu\u2019s small hand, already teased by himself with her five fingers separated and ready, He Yunxiao pursed the corners of his upturned mouth, secretly amused in his heart.He had no doubt that he could get a 100 per cent grip on Nanzhu\u2019s hand if he went to shake it now. At most, he would be met with a little token resistance from her hand, and at most, a few fake unpleasant words of anger from Nanzhu\u2019s mouth.But the current He Yunxiao would not do that.After the previous experience of Nanzhu\u2019s favourable level, exploding, He Yunxiao was now much more mature. When dealing with traditional and decent girls like Zirou sister and Nanzhu. As long as they didn\u2019t take the initiative themselves or didn\u2019t allow it themselves, He Yunxiao would never cross the line.The favorability that could be forcibly created by one\u2019s own initiative was too watery and too risky to gamble on. It is better to take your time and be practical.Although Nanzhu\u2019s favorability is currently only 50, He Yunxiao feels that the intimacy with Nanzhu now, based on previous favorability, must be at least 90 or more. He knew that he hadn\u2019t even had the chance to use such actions as kissing the forehead and spanking on his sister Jiang and sister Du, who also had a favorability of 90 or more.He Yunxiao kept rubbing the fingertips of Nanzhu on his hand and continued to whisper, \u201cNanzhu, just heal for a while, I\u2019ll let go when Xing\u2019er comes, okay? Nanzhu be good, just for a little while.\u201dSeeing that Nanzhu was so worn out that she was about to nod her head in agreement, Xing\u2019er\u2019s voice suddenly got louder over there.\u201cYoung Master He? Your Highness? Are you here?\u201dSeeing Xing\u2019er\u2019s figure move faintly behind the rack, Meng Qingrou hurriedly left He Yunxiao behind and touched her red cheeks as she squatted beside the stove where the potions were being made.She even sat closer to the stove on purpose, pretending that her face was red from the fire.When Xing\u2019er arrived, she looked at He Yunxiao and her Highness, who were quite far away, and could not help but sigh.She said to Meng Qingrou first, \u201cYour Highness, the rice is ready.\u201dMeng Qingrou did not want to be laughed at by her best sister, who had sworn yesterday that she would never believe again. but today, when she saw the real person, she was defeated at the first touch and surrendered completely.She said in a calm tone, \u201cTake him away. Tomorrow, don\u2019t take it upon yourself to let him in without permission.\u201dXing\u2019er looked at He Yunxiao and said somewhat apologetically, \u201cYes, Xing\u2019er understands.\u201dThen she said, \u201cYoung Master He, come.\u201dHe Yunxiao held back his laughter and did not open his mouth to poke her for the sake of Nanzhu\u2019s little bit of majesty and face as the eldest princess.After leaving the room, he walked beside Xing\u2019er and opened his mouth to ask, \u201cXing\u2019er, what does Nanzhu usually do?\u201dXing\u2019er smiled and said, \u201cHer Highness stays in Linxuan Palace all day. Only in the afternoon would she go out to get some sunshine. The things Her Highness would do on weekdays were usually tending to the herb garden, studying the prescriptions and sorting out the herbs. but recently Her Highness has been sews sachets for Her Highness Xiaoyue.\u201dHe Yunxiao nodded his head to show that he understood.He naturally knew about Nanzhu\u2019s sewing sachets for Xiaoyue. It was here that he and Nanzhu first met.At that time, Nanzhu was \u201ccutting the grass\u201d to prepare the incense. Then she accidentally cut her hand, and this accident became the beginning of the story.He Yunxiao asked again, \u201cXing\u2019er, what are Nanzhu\u2019s favourite things or hobbies?\u201dXing\u2019er thought for a moment and said, \u201cHer Highness used to love small animals, but then she got injured and \u2026\u2026 never touched them. There are also none of those things that can hurt people around Linxuan Palace now.\u201dHe Yunxiao thought about it carefully, and with Nanzhu\u2019s body, it was true that she couldn\u2019t keep cats and dogs or anything like that. Although there was now his own blood to help heal her wounds, it was better to avoid them just to be on the safe side.\u201cDoes she like anything else?\u201dApricot thought carefully, \u201cGenerally what a young girl would like, Her Highness would like, only, if it\u2019s something in particular, I don\u2019t know.\u201dHe Yunxiao was not surprised by Xing\u2019er\u2019s answer. Just imagine, if one lived in Linxuan Palace all day long, and was exposed to all these things every day, and saw all these familiar faces, how could one have any special, particular hobbies in that case?He Yunxiao suddenly thought, what would happen if he took Nanzhu out for a walk? Just like how he had taken Chu Chu to the Tingfeng Tower, he could take Nanzhu, who had always lived in the palace, for a walk in the streets of Yinjing.I think what people who have lived in the palace for a long time like most, is \u201cbeing loved\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d.By taking her out of the palace, to go shopping like a normal person, did, it give her \u201cfreedom\u201d?He Yunxiao suddenly understood.Why did Nanzhu\u2019s favorability towards him rise so quickly on the day she first met him, and also today?It was because she was so eager to be loved.Just like a thirsty person in the desert, she would be willing to accept a little water as long as it was available.At this moment, He Yunxiao understood even more how much he had hurt Nanzhu in the first place. To snatch away what little love she may have left from the hands of the one who lacks it \u2026\u2026It was simply an unforgivable sin.He Yunxiao took a deep breath and said to Xing\u2019er, \u201cXing\u2019er, if I want to take Nanzhu out of the palace, what should I do?\u201dXing\u2019er didn\u2019t know why He Yunxiao suddenly asked this and was surprised, \u201cUsually a princess has to get permission from the empress to leave the palace. Now there is no Empress in our dynasty, the Empress Dowager is in charge of the imperial court, so if Young Master wants to go out, you need the Empress Dowager\u2019s permission to do so.\u201dWhen He Yunxiao heard the Empress Dowager, he got a headache.\u201cIs there another way?\u201dXing\u2019er whispered, \u201cSecretly?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dXing\u2019er said, \u201cIf a palace maid leaves the palace, she has to have a warrant from the Shang Palace Bureau.\u201dHe Yunxiao laughed, \u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t involve the Empress Dowager, everything else is a minor problem.\u201dNanzhu, wait for me to take you shopping!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wake up!!!\u201d\u201cWake up!!!\u201dYet no matter how much she shouted or shook.Jiang Mu remained like a \u2018dead body\u2019.There was no response.If not for the fact that her master-servant relationship allowed her to sense that Jiang Mu\u2019s soul had not yet been taken over.She would have destroyed Jiang Mu\u2019s physical body, completely, on the spot.Suddenly. In the back of her mind, faintly.She heard someone calling her.\u201cLittle cute \u2026.\u201d\u201cLittle cute \u2026.\u201d\u201cFeeling the silk \u2026.\u201d\u201cCutie \u2026.\u201d?!That voice\u2026It was him!The Black Water Fury\u2019s pupils fluttered, and her heart felt like it had been violently grabbed.Her heart burning like fire, she replied to Jiang Mu in her head in a tearful voice.\u201cBastard! Wake up!\u201d\u201cIf you dare to be taken over! I\u2019ll \u2026I\u2019ll destroy you completely!\u201d\u201cand kill everyone!!!

(TL: Jiang Mu, you\u2019re right man, but not right either.)If his soul was really snatched, then she would lose the meaning of living.Jiang Mu, as her master, was well aware of this.\u201cLittle cutie, don\u2019t worry, I haven\u2019t punished you for lying to me yet, and how can I die?\u201d\u201cNow you listen to me.\u201d\u201cI have a way, a way to get me out of his\u2019s seizure while turning him into a complete puppet!\u201dWhen the Black Water Fury outside heard this, it was as if she had grabbed the straw that would save her life.Her tone became ecstatic, and she eagerly asked.\u201cWhat solution? Tell me quickly!\u201dJiang Mu said in a deep tone.\u201cThe Soul Book!\u201d\u201cAs long as you use the soul book, a spiritual technique, to summon Blackwater Seat\u2019s soul into space.\u201d\u201cThen, he will not be able to possess me, and I will awaken!\u201d\u201cBut Black Water Seat, who has been summoned into Soul Book space, may resist and attack you.\u201cThis will require you to have a strong enough soul power to suppress his soul.\u201cMoreover, you will have to drive his soul, after knocking it unconscious, back into his body.\u201cSo that I can perform the Serpent God Jidai on him!\u201cCan you do that?\u201dWithout even thinking about it, Black Water Fury replied, grinning.\u201cThere is nothing that this god cannot do!!!\u201dHaving said that.She was on fire, preparing to cast the Soul Book.Jiang Mu, on the other hand, tried to find a way to delay being robbed of his body.He looked ahead at the Black Water Seat, who was laughing eerily all the while.Then he smiled a harmless smile, and said with genuine affection and compliments.\u201cPretty boy, you are so handsome, the snake girls in the village must all like you.\u201d -Jiang MuThe village \u2026. The snake girls \u2026.?The \u201cJie Jie Jie\u201d grin came to an abrupt halt as Black Water Seat suddenly fell into a deep daze.In his memory, a few moments flashed by.It was a clip of him brutally eating all the snake girls who had a crush on him\u2026Seeing that he was frozen, Jiang Mu knew that he had a chance!So he continued with his harmless smile and complimented him, saying.\u201cYou\u2019re so handsome, you must be a clan hero!\u201d -Jiang Mu\u201cYou must be very kind-hearted to be a clan hero!\u201d\u201cYou must love and care for your people!\u201dLove and care \u2026.

Ten thousand years!Blackwater Seat\u2019s face instantly turned ferocious.His golden vertical pupils glared deadly at Jiang Mu.\u201cYou lowly human!\u201d\u201cHow dare you mock me at the end of your life?\u201d\u201cIs it courageous to say that you are courageous, or do you not know how high the sky is?!\u201d\u201cBecome the nourishment for me!!!\u201dBlack Water Seat pounced furiously on Jiang Mu, to devour him.F*ck! He was having such a good conversation, why did he suddenly get violent?Jiang Mu panicked.As if his soul was being intimidated by Black Water Seat.So he couldn\u2019t move even a little.Even if he could move, his soul power was so weak that he couldn\u2019t escape the other party\u2019s devouring.\u2013Little cutie hurry up! Hurry!!!Jiang Mu\u2019s soul had begun to tremble in fear.Fortunately, it was at this moment.As the Black Water Seat was about to touch Jiang Mu.He suddenly turned into a ray of light.Finally, he disappeared in front of Jiang Mu\u2019s eyes.The next moment, the endless darkness became bright.Jiang Mu suddenly opened his eyes and the dark red cave came into view.\u201cWhew!

Is that the lowly human outside?!\u201dBlackwater Seat\u2019s three views were strongly shattered and his face became extremely ugly.It was not because his Demon God realm soul had been forcibly summoned and was unable to resist.Rather, it was because.His Blackwater Serpent clan was once the Lord of the Wilderness.Now there was actually a clan member who would go and acknowledge a lowly human as their master?!What a disgrace to the Blackwater Serpent clan!Disgracing the honor of the Blackwater Jedi!He coldly and sarcastically accused the Blackwater Fury, saying.\u201cHow dare you get close to a lowly human?\u201d\u201cTo even acknowledge a weak human as your master?\u201d\u201cWhat a shame for my people!\u201d\u201cThe honor of the Blackwater Jedi has been tarnished by you!!!\u201dThe Blackwater Fury snorted with sarcasm and said in return.\u201cYou, a beast who relies on the mutilation of clan members to raise your cultivation, dare to speak such words of great righteousness.?\u201cDoes this god mock and despise you?\u201d\u201cAncient serpent god?\u201d\u201cIn this god\u2019s opinion.\u201d\u201cThe bottom line of all the anal worms in you is above your virtue!\u201d\u201cHahahahahaha!!!\u201dThe Black Water Fury ridiculed feverishly while secretly gathering soul power.Her purpose was to piss off Blackwater Fury and make him neglect his defenses.So that she could use her soul power to knock him out with a full force strike!Black Water seat might have been irritated by Jiang Mu just now.Now, after hearing these words from Black Water Fury, he instantly became extremely furious.So furious that it was as if his pupils were trembling.He finally couldn\u2019t help himself and shouted in anger.\u201cI eat my fellow clansmen! It is because they are so poorly qualified! To live is to waste the resources of the Blackwater Jedi!\u201cYou know that barren land is barren and that spiritual energy is scarce, right?\u201cWhy not incorporate them into my body? Become my nourishment! Make me stronger!\u201cWhen I am strong! I will be able to lead the clan back to the throne of the Wilderness Lord!\u201cIf I can break through to the legendary Immortal realm, then my Blackwater Serpent Clan will become the number one race in the entire World!\u201cI, the Black Water Snake Clan, will then unify the entire World!\u201cSo I am not wrong and you are all so short-sighted!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand the goodness and greatness of my heart!\u201cKakaka!!!\u201d\u201cTake this, You bastard!!!\u201dThe Black Water Fury actually imitated Jiang Mu and burst out a foul sentence.With a gaping glare, the accumulated soul power burst out from her body.It completely shot towards the laughing Blackwater seat.Boom!!!\u201cUghh\u2026!!!\u201dThe laughing him was struck by the powerful soul power on the spot.Passing out immediately.\u201cGet lost!!!\u201dBlack Water Fury was fierce and kicked him out of Soul Book space.At the same time.In her mind, she was ecstatic to communicate with Jiang Mu.\u201cMaster! I knocked out that beast!!!\u201d\u201cThe little cutie is superb! Mwahahaha!\u201dOutside, Jiang Mu was overjoyed to praise the Black Water Fury.Immediately, he struck up a complex seal, and on his body, he cast the forbidden spell.\u201cSerpent God Jidai!\u201d\u201cArise!\u201dThe next moment.The body of the Black Water Seat floated out with the soul of a snake god.Then.Jiang Mu extended three fingers and pointed at the snake\u2019s soul.\u201cGo!\u201dThree lines of red, white and green were drilled out from the tips of the three fingers.Those were the lines that represented memory deletion, memory tampering, and memory implantation, respectively.The three memory lines were inserted into the soul\u2019s skull.Jiang Mu sensed the snake\u2019s soul\u2019s memories in detail.Then he found it.There was a strong, desire to kill the Black water Fury within it.There were also memories of him mutilating the clan, being sealed by the clan, and so on and so forth.\u201cIt seems that these should be, in fact, the part of his memories that he secretly kept.\u201d\u201cHm? That\u2019s strange.\u201d\u201cApart from this part of memories, I don\u2019t seem to see any memories that Cutie has tampered with or implanted, either.\u201dJiang Mu felt strange.It was because Black Water Fury had previously admitted to him.She had tampered with his memories and implanted some memories that she had forged when she had turned him into a puppet.But what Jiang Mu saw now was only that part of the memory that was secretly kept.No matter how much he searched, he could not find those memories that had been tampered with and implanted.To this.Jiang Mu could only think of one possibility.\u201cThese tampered, implanted memories were completely overwritten by that secretly retained memory with his early awakening.\u201d\u201cIn that case, the only way to do it is to re-implant them.\u201dJiang Mu had to re-implant some memories.So first, he used his soul power to manipulate the red thread and remove all the memories from his soul.Deleting all of them.Next.He manipulated the green thread to remove some of the little cutie\u2019s experiences, perceptions, behaviors, habits. And so on.It was completely implanted into his Soul.At the same time, in order to ensure that he would absolutely follow the plot of Black Water Fury.Jiang Mu had also implanted some strong memories, including but not limited to, for example.Not to kill Xue Menghan, Lu Churuo, Lihua, Han Yuqing, Ding Nanrong, Changyu An Meng, Jiang Mu, Qu Nishang, Bai Qingwu, Xue Youlei and 100% assisted in educating Ling Aotian, 100% obedient in protecting Ling Aotian, 100% self-sacrificing in making Ling Aotian whole, etcAfter 1 hour of operation.Jiang Mu just about ran out of soul power and turned his body.And looked at the second Black Water Fury!Finally.Jiang Mu also couldn\u2019t bear the weakness due to the consumption of his soul\u2019s power, and fell into a deep sleep.And before passing out.He felt behind him, by a pair of withered and white hands.Firmly holding on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wake up.\u201dJiang Mu shouted softly.The Black Water Fury\u2019s eyelashes fluttered for a moment and suddenly opened her eyes.Those fierce golden vertical pupils were locked on Jiang Mu\u2019s face in a deadlyImmediately.A look of surprise filled those golden pupils.\u201cBastard! You\u2019ve finally woken up!!!\u201dThe Black Water Fury was overjoyed, hugging Jiang Mu\u2019s arms and uncontrollably tightening them a few times.\u201cLet go let go! My ribs are going to break!\u201dJiang Mu seemed to hear a \u2018cackling\u2019 crunching sound from his ribs and hurriedly slapped Black Water Fury\u2019s hand.\u201cAh!\u201dBlack Water Fury hurriedly let go of his arm, worry written all over her face.\u201cAre you alright?\u201dShe hurriedly rubbed and patted Jiang Mu\u2019s chest.Only those fingers had withered like dried branches, with little flesh.The rubbing caused Jiang Mu a raw pain.\u201cYour hand\u2026\u201dJiang Mu frowned and carried Black Water Fury to the front and placed her on his lap.He scanned her body a bit.She was already a loli and now had lost a few times more weight than she had at the beginning.So he grabbed both of her arms.Upon inspection, he found that there was little flesh left, and that they had become dry, leathery bones.Her collarbones and shoulders were also extremely bony.With his palms, he reached inside her skirt and held her ribs.The bones felt extremely strong.Upwards, there was only a slight obstruction.Downwards, the pelvis felt extremely strong.Further down, the humerus, the calf, the foot\u2026All of them felt like skin and bones.Jiang Mu frowned in confusion and asked Black Water Fury.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201cThe Demon God realm can even manage to regenerate severed limbs.\u201cIt should also be easy if you want to recover some flesh, right?\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you recovering?\u201dBlack Water Fury narrowed her eyes and stared at Jiang Mu\u2019s eyes as she answered back.\u201cBecause the lifespan I overdrew by performing the Serpent God Jidai is the lifespan of my soul!\u201d????The overdraft was the life span of the soul?\u201cMeaning, you can\u2019t return to your original form?\u201dJiang Mu\u2019s frown deepened.He felt frustrated for Black Water Fury.Originally, she was petite and loli-like, how cute she was.Now she was as thin as a bone.No one could accept that.The Black Water Fury smoothed her long white hair with her withered fingers and stared at Jiang Mu with a grim smile, saying.\u201cWhat, are you disgusted to see this god with this withered bone look?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dJiang Mu was speechless.Because of the master-servant relationship, the Black Water Fury was able to sense his emotions.He didn\u2019t dislike her at all.Now that she could make jokes about it, it meant she didn\u2019t care about appearances either.\u201cBastard! You dislike this god!\u201dThe Black Water Fury grabbed Jiang Mu\u2019s shoulder and her gaze turned a few shades more hostile.Jiang Mu didn\u2019t say anything back.He looked around the narrow cave for a week and found that there were only the two of them.Where is he?Then he asked urgently.\u201cWhere are we? Where is that guy?\u201dBlackwater Fury coldly said back.\u201cThis is a dark cave within the ancient tomb of the Serpent God.\u201cIt is also a secret blood pool that I used to open secretly.\u201cAs for that beast, Black Water Seat.\u201cHe is still sleeping in the ancient tomb.\u201cIt will be sleeping for at least another day.\u201dSo that was it.Then why come here again?Looking at the slimy pool of blood in front of him, Jiang Mu asked curiously.\u201cWhat did you bring me here for? What is the use of this pool of blood?\u201dThe Black Water Fury said discontentedly.\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered this god yet, say! Do you dislike this god now?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dJiang Mu was speechless once again and just looked straight at her.The look made her ears start to flush and burn.\u201cWhat are you looking at! You just dislike this god! Hmph!\u201dHm?Good lord.Why does it feel like she\u2019s\u2026 Spoiled Child?Jiang Mu\u2019s face turned odd.So he moved closer to her face and stared at her intently.\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re still staring! Speak up! Do you dislike this god or not?\u201dBlack Water Fury\u2019s ears turned even redder at the stare.Her little heart also started pounding.Her withered fingers, which were gripping Jiang Mu\u2019s shoulders, also unconsciously tightened a few points.But she still had a fierce look on her face.Seeing this, Jiang Mu, he had already understood.She was pouting.It was\u2026It was so new.It was so funny.Ha.Jiang Mu felt a bit like laughing.He found that Black Water Fury was really getting cuter and cuter.The Black Water Fury saw how Jiang Mu wanted to laugh but held it back.She was so angry that she gritted her teeth.She didn\u2019t know why she was holding on to the \u2018dislike\u2019 issue.In fact, deep in her soul, she had long known that Jiang Mu did not dislike her.But she didn\u2019t know why.She just wanted Jiang Mu to say it himself.She wanted, wanted, wanted to hear Jiang Mu say it with her own ears, saying that he didn\u2019t dislike her.\u201cSay it! Or else\u2026 Or else this god will beat you to death!\u201d\u201cPfft hahahahahahahahaha!\u201dJiang Mu couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud.\u201cYou dare to Laugh! Speak up!!!\u201dBlack Water Fury was laughed at so much that she wanted to find a hole to burrow into, and was even more eager to gag him with a punch.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll say it, I\u2019ll say it alright.\u201dJiang Mu slowly stopped laughing.Then he coughed lightly and stared seriously into her eyes.He could see that there was anticipation and nervousness embedded in her eyes.What a little cutie.Hmm?It was\u2026Jiang Mu was stunned.He saw that there was a light mark at the corner of each of Black Water Fury\u2019s eyes.That was\u2026 Traces of tears!Did she cry?Then he asked directly.\u201cLittle cutie, did you cry before?\u201dThe anticipation and tension in Black Water Fury\u2019s eyes were instantly replaced by panic.So panicked that she slurred her words.But she still had a ruthless face.\u201cCrying\u2026 So what if I cried!\u201d\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the fear of you losing all your soul power and never waking up from your sleep, this God wouldn\u2019t be crying at all!\u201d\u201cThis God is the head of a clan!\u201d\u201cAnd the peak powerhouse of the Demon God realm!\u201d\u201cHow can I cry like a child?\u201d\u201cWhat a\u2026 Shame on me!\u201d\u201cSuperficial!!!\u201d\u201cBlah blah blah!!!\u201dHmmm.No shame in hiding.As expected of you, Blackwater Fury.Jiang Mu was a little touched.He smiled slightly and cupped his hands around her face.Then Chu~ He slowly kissed the tear stains at the corners of her eyes.The Black Water Fury was surprised by his action.But there was no escape.She just waited with her big golden eyes open.Bar-kee!Bar \u2013 ki!Jiang Mu kissed the tear marks off both corners of her eyes.Only then did he naturally say that.\u201cI don\u2019t mind you, never have.\u201dHe had just finished speaking.Black Water Fury\u2019s breath caught.Then she threw him to the ground.A pair of withered hands grabbed his belt and hissed, !!\u201cRub!

This blood pool.\u201d\u201cIt can actually restore your body to flesh and blood?\u201dJiang Mu rubbed and held down the Black Water Fury\u2019s arms, ribs, and leg bones\u2026Flesh had grown in these places, and there was no visible bone.Now the Black Water Fury\u2019s body, after absorbing the essence of the blood pool through was already close to returning to her original shape.It was just her long hair, which was still white.\u201cHmm, this blood pool, was secretly opened by this god back then.\u201dBlack Water Fury comfortably leaned against Jiang Mu\u2019s chest.She took his two large hands and placed them in her small non-existence breast and tilting her head back, she asked\u201cHow do you like it?\u201dJiang Mu looked down, kissed her forehead in return, and said.\u201cI like it any way you like it.\u201dBlack Water Fury narrowed her eyes, satisfied with this answer.She wrapped her arms around Jiang Mu, her fingers intertwined between his fingers.At the same time, she talked about the purpose of this blood pool.\u201cThis blood pool, apart from helping me recover my blood and flesh, can also improve your physique.\u201d\u201cImprove my physique?\u201dJiang Mu froze for a moment, and the rubbing and pressing of his fingertips couldn\u2019t help but stop.The Black Water Fury nodded.She redirected Jiang Mu\u2019s fingers and continued rubbing and pressing.Only then did she continue.\u201cAs long as you absorb and refine the essence within the blood pool, not only will your physical quality improve.\u201d\u201cYour cultivation realm can also be increased substantially.\u201d\u201cProbably, you will be able to break through to the third level of the Qi Sea realm.\u201dQi Hai Realm\u2026. Third level?What, isn\u2019t that awesome!Jiang Mu was truly stunned.To break through from the Spirit Gathering Realm, to the Qi Sea Mirror.It was something that required great perseverance to cultivate hard day and night.Only an ordinary person\u2019s physique might be cultivated for a lifetime.They wouldn\u2019t even be able to break through the Qi Sea Mirror.And Jiang Mu, the villain, was really an average person\u2019s physique.Fortunately. He had grown up under the immersion of high grade spiritual pills since he was a child.His perseverance was also strong enough, and he basically worked hard day and night to get high on the pills.That was why he was able to make a relatively smooth, breakthrough from the Spirit Gathering Realm to the first level of the Qi Sea Realm later on.However, now Black Water Fury said that this blood pool.It could actually make him break through from the Spirit Gathering Realm directly to the third level of the Qi Sea Realm.It was truly awesome!No matter how you look at it, this is like a chance that only the protagonist gets.Could I be the protagonist?But there was no way Jiang Mu would choose to break through.Because he had to go by the plot.So to Black Water Fury, he said:\u201cI won\u2019t absorb the essence of the blood pool, so you can absorb it all and recover as soon as possible. \u201dBlack Water Fury blinked.She had already guessed the reason Jiang Mu refused to absorb it.So she deliberately asked.\u201cAre you afraid that \u2026 That absorbing a portion of the Blood Pool Essence would affect my recovery?\u201dOoh?To actually be able to say that?Jiang Mu obediently took advantage of the situation and affirmed his back.\u201cThat\u2019s right, i\u2019m just worried about your body!\u201d\u201cYou see, I\u2019m good to you, right?\u201d\u201cFor you, I don\u2019t even want to break through.\u201d\u201cSo, ah, you must listen to me well from now on, your master.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t fail to live up to the goodness I\u2019ve done for you.\u201d\u201cGot it?\u201dSaid the end.He also rubbed and pressed hard, making an \u2018I am totally thinking of you\u2019 look on his face.This was only amusing to Black Water Fury\u2019s eyes.She didn\u2019t expose him either.Instead, she suddenly jumped on the topic and asked.\u201cDid I catch you just now?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dJiang Mu was confused, not understanding what she meant.She asked once more.\u201cJust now, did I, uh, catch you?\u201dSaid and she smirked and moved up and down.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJiang Mu understood now.Nodding his head back, he said.\u201cYes, but it\u2019s starting to get better as your blood and flesh slowly recovers.\u201dBlack Water Fury grinned.She stuck out her long, forked tongue and drilled down into the object covered with blood vessels.With a grim smile.\u201cAgain?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWithout waiting for Jiang Mu to reply, her tongue was already fighting with that object.The fight caused the object covered with blood vessels to swell and gush furiously.After a while.She stood up for only a bit.Then.Sat down violently!\u2026\u201cHissy-ah-!!!\u201d\u2026The time came to night.The Black Water Fury had already absorbed and refined all the essence within the blood pool.Now her body.It had already changed from its previous skin and bones appearance.It had changed back to its original normal fleshy appearance.Jiang Mu stood by the side.Watching her use her soul power to create a white dress on her own body.He couldn\u2019t help but praise and say.\u201cYou look good in a white dress, too, it goes well with your white hair.\u201dThe Black Water Fury glanced at him proudly and did not say anything back.It was just the delight on her face that spoke for itself.After she finished her dress and combed her long hair.Then she grabbed Jiang Mu\u2019s hand.\u201cLet\u2019s go out.\u201dShe cast a spatial spirit technique.A spatial ripple then rose up around her.The next moment.The duo disappeared inside the cave.\u2026Inside the Ancient Tomb of the Serpent God.A ripple rose up in the air.Then.Just out of thin air, a little loli with golden pupils in a white dress and long, straight white hair appeared.There was also a young man.\u201cLittle cutie, did Blackwater Seat ever wake up in the middle of the process? Did it see our appearance?\u201d\u201cNeither, the beast has been unconscious until now after being completely struck by my powerful soul power, and will not wake up until at least tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dJiang Mu was satisfied.If Black Water Seat had woken up and seen the two of them.That would be difficult to deal with.Jiang Mu came to the sleeping Blackwater Seat and looked at his cloaked, black robed costume.He felt quite satisfied.Although the Blackwater Seat was a male.But it wouldn\u2019t affect Ling Aotian\u2019s revenge line, upgrade line, or harem line.Especially the harem line.As a paperwork from above hit down midway.The scared goon author immediately changed the \u2018jockey knows\u2019 stunt and changed Black Water Seat\u2019s happy ending to a tragic ending of self-sacrifice to fulfill Ling Aotian.So, it was impossible for Blackwater Seat to get into bed with Ling Aotian.There was not even a chance of physical contact.Hmm, Not bad for a trashy harem.Jiang Mu said to the Black Water Fury beside him.\u201cIt\u2019s already been a day.\u201cIt\u2019s not too late. I have to go back to Lingyin Kingdom to find Ling Aotian as soon as possible.\u201cYou should first get into the Space Ring.\u201cI\u2019ll carry him myself and teleport back.\u201dThe Black Water Fury nodded.Then she turned into a white mist and drilled into Jiang Mu\u2019s Ring.And before drilling in, she corrected one thing.\u201cIt\u2019s not a day, you\u2019ve been unconscious for four days.\u201dFour \u2026. Four days?!Tremble!!Jiang Mu was struck by lightning and his whole body stood frozen in place.He couldn\u2019t move for a long time.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Master? Master?.\u201dBlack Water Fury felt curious.\u201cNo\u2026 No, I was thinking about something.\u201dJiang Mu responded stiffly.Yet in his mind, he was already cursing the heavens.F*ck! I\u2019ve actually been unconscious for four days!That is to say.Today was the twentieth day of March.And the day after, the 22nd.That\u2019s the day the Shahe\u2019s demon army vanguard\u2026. The day of the invasion of the southern border!Damn it!I\u2019ve got to hurry up and throw the Blackwater Seat to Ling Aotian.Then rush back to the Wuyou Sect.Jiang Mu hurriedly grabbed the back of Blackwater Seat\u2019s clothes.Casting is an immortal technique.\u201cExtreme Flash!\u201dA flash of white light passed.Jiang Mu disappeared from within the Ancient Tomb of the Serpent God.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If my master, was here, I would have killed the shit out of you all by myself!\u201dOriginally, when he arrived at this village, he saw that there was only one Spirit Gathering Realm cultivator resting.So he sneaked up on the other one, intending to rob him of his treasures.Who would have expected that.The other party was just bait, and three of his accomplices immediately surrounded the area.Now, these four forced him and Miss Xiaohua to hand over all their treasures, out of sheer strength.That was not at all.They wanted to defile him and Miss Xiaohua?!What a beastly act!!!Ling Aotian turned his head and said heavily to Miss Xiaohua.\u201cMiss Xiaohua!\u201d\u201cThese people, who have no moral boundaries, will never let us go!\u201d\u201cSo, this time, I beg you too!\u201dLing Aotian felt fortunate.He did not expect that Miss Xiaohua\u2019s cultivation level was at the Qi Sea realm.Moreover, for the past four days, Miss Xiaohua had been accompanying him.Every time he was in danger, Miss Xiaohua would step in to save him.So it seemed.Miss Xiaohua must have fallen in love with him!When he thought that, Ling Aotian couldn\u2019t help but smile wickedly at her.\u201cIt\u2019s alright now, leave it to this girl!\u201dMiss Xiaohua smiled sweetly back.However, in her heart, she was cursing all the while.\u201cThat bastard Jiang Mu!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been four days and he still hasn\u2019t shown up!\u201d\u201cCausing me to have to reveal my cultivation and save this fool Ling Aotian every time!\u201dLihua cursed and was extremely upset.Ever since Jiang Mu had instantly escaped in front of her.She had been forced to follow Ling Aotian.Because she knew, Jiang Mu would definitely come back again and approach Ling Aotian to keep the plot on track.And she had to get Jiang Mu\u2019s Transformation Technique and Instantaneous Transport Technique from Jiang Mu.So she followed Ling Aotian\u2019s side and waited silently for Jiang Mu to return.It just, it had already been four days of waiting.Jiang Mu had never appeared.And in these four days.Every time Ling Aotian fought with demonic beasts, or fought with other cultivators, and every time he was in danger of his life.She had to rush to his rescue.The role of her was already comparable to that of Black Water Fury.\u201cBastard Jiang Mu!\u201d\u201cCould it be that his P-flame has been stirred up too much by me.\u201d\u201cSo much so that he\u2019s been doing it for four days straight and is weakened?\u201d\u201cAnd now he\u2019s bedridden?\u201dJust as Lihua was randomly guessing.The four cultivators around them suddenly rose up furiously.They were coming towards her and Ling Aotian to kill the two of them.\u201cMiss Xiaohua! I\u2019ll, go first!\u201dLing Aotian shouted in a deep voice.Then, with one foot on the ground, he charged up in a dashing and domineering manner.Go on! Why don\u2019t you go and die already!Lihua was extremely displeased.But she also had to join the fight to prevent Ling Aotian from being suddenly killed.Among the four opponents, three of them were Spirit Gathering Mirror and one was at the Qi Sea realm.Although she was enough to kill all four of them by herself if she used her full strength.But she did not choose to do so.Instead, she had done it deliberately, holding that Qi Sea Realm cultivator back.So that those other three Spirit Gathering Realm cultivators could go and beat up Ling Aotian.Nothing else.She simply looked at Ling Aotian with displeasure and wanted him to receive a severe beating.The result was just as she had hoped.BANG, BANG, THUD!!!It didn\u2019t take long.\u201cArghh\u2026! Miss Xiaohua save me!\u201dLing Aotian cried out miserably for help.He was punched and sent flying by the combined strikes of those three Spirit Gathering Realm cultivators.He fell hard to the ground.\u201cCough!\u201dAnd spat out a mouthful of blood.It looked like the injuries were pretty serious.Good beating oh! Hahahahahahaha!Lihua laughed out loud in her heart of pleasure.She decided to continue this next time and let Ling Aotian get beaten up.\u201cMi-miss Xiaohua! Save \u2026. Arghh\u2026! Cough!\u201dLing Aotian was again knocked flying by those three Spirit Gathering realms, vomiting blood in the air.Once again, he fell hard to the ground.He struggled to stand up.Although he couldn\u2019t stand too steadily.However, his cold and unyielding gaze was fixed on the three people with a deadly stare.It was as if his eyes could kill them.This caused the three to ridicule.\u201cYoo-hoo? You\u2019re still fine, you can still stand up?\u201d\u201cHe looks physically fit.\u201d\u201cAnd he has sharp eyes too, but it\u2019s a pity he is gonna be killed.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s so resistant to beating, I wonder if he can resist exploding too, Kakakaka!\u201dThe three men took advantage of the situation and continued to surround Ling Aotian.On the other side.Slice!Lihua stabbed her sword through the abdomen of that Qi Sea Realm cultivator.However, she deliberately avoided his vital points and only severely injured him to the point of unconsciousness.She jumped onto the haystack and hid herself.Watching from afar.The battle scene on Ling Aotian\u2019s side.\u201cI, Ling Aotian, swear! One day, you will all be\u2026 Arhhhhhh\u2026!!\u201dLing Aotian hadn\u2019t even finished letting out his threatening words.He was sent flying again by the combo of those three, tumbling through the air and vomiting out a few mouthfuls of blood.Finally, he fell to the ground again hard.\u201cCough cough cough!\u201dHe wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and struggled to stand up.But when he was halfway up, he fell back down.He continued to stand up again, with difficulty and with difficulty.He was still cold and unyielding, staring deadly at the three cultivators who were mocking him in front of him.As Lihua watched from afar, she could not help but marvel.\u201cA protagonist is a protagonist after all.\u201d\u201cThis amazing willpower is truly something far beyond the reach of ordinary people.\u201d\u201cAnd his self-confidence, even more so than ordinary people possess.\u201d\u201cEven so, he won\u2019t be able to beat those three.\u201d\u201cGotta go save him before he gets killed.\u201dThought.Lihua was ready to jump out of the hayloft and go save Ling Aotian.Suddenly.In her after image, she was caught by a faint flash of light.\u201cThis light?!\u201dShe snapped her eyes around to look.The location, was behind a hayloft not far away.\u201cCould it be \u2026.\u201d\u201cIs it Jiang Mu? did he come back?!\u201dLihua was suddenly delighted.She was familiar with that light.Jiang Mu had been in front of her eyes before, after emitting such a glow.And then he disappeared in an instant.\u201cLet\u2019s see if it\u2019s him first!\u201dIn order to confirm if it was Jiang Mu behind that hayloft.Lihua casts out the secret technique of the White Fox Clan.So first, she got the fox tail out.Poff!She plucked out a tail hair and blew a breath on it.Then she made a seal formation.\u201cFox Fairy Nine Transformations \u2013 Fox Fur Transformation!\u201dBang!That white fox tail hair turned into a small bee.\u201cGo!\u201dThe little bee flew out.In three or two flaps, it flew to the back of that hayloft in the distance.Through the little bee\u2019s vision.Lihua could clearly see.Jiang Mu was hiding behind the hayloft, and beside him, there was a delicate young man with a cloak in a black robe lying unconscious.Jiang Mu could only be seen sneaking around, poking his head out from behind the hayloft.Secretly, he observed the position of Ling Aotian\u2019s side.Upon seeing the seriously injured Ling Aotian surrounded by three cultivators.He looked shocked.Then with a \u201cPoff\u201d.Immediately, transformed into a cute, young girl in a yellow dress.Looks like, he was ready to move out to rescue Ling Aotian.\u201cIt\u2019s really him!\u201d\u201cThis time, I\u2019ll definitely keep a firm eye on you!\u201d\u201cAnd then eat you up completely! To the bottom! Tame! Tame you!\u201dLihua excitedly shook her tail.Then hurriedly moved.Going straight to Jiang Mu\u2019s location.However, she didn\u2019t even run a few steps.She stopped immediately.Because she suddenly thought of a brilliant plan.A brilliant plan that would make Jiang Mu, once again, perform a \u2018heroic rescue\u2019!\u201cHehehehehe, I\u2019ll definitely *force* you tonight!\u201dThe innocent and sweet face of Lihua revealed a cunning fox smile.\u201cWatch me! Cough!\u201dShe took the initiative to suffer internal injuries and spurted out a mouthful of blood, staining her white dress red.In order to feign that she was seriously injured.Then, turning in a direction, she carried her sword towards the three cultivators.Running limply.With a tearful cry on her lips.\u201cI, Xiaohua, will fight with you!

Thankfully it is alright.\u201d\u201cI thought that after Lihua\u2019s persona was crooked, she would never put in any effort or run away.\u201d\u201cNow it seems.\u201d\u201cLihua is following the original plot just like that.\u201d\u201cAfter she defeated that Qi Hai realm cultivator, she would then rescue Ling Aotian.\u201dIn his mind, Jiang Mu briefly and quickly went through the plot of these four days.Within those four days, Ling Aotian hadn\u2019t relied on the Black Water Fury to turn the tide when he was in danger.This was because Lihua had revealed her cultivation level at the Qi Sea realm.She wanted to gain Ling Aotian\u2019s trust as soon as possible, so she was eager to get Ling Aotian into danger repeatedly so that she could save him.In fact, she was also very successful.It made Ling Aotian\u2019s favorable opinion of her skyrocket, which meant that a romantic thread was developing.And tonight.In the original plot, When Ling Aotian and Lihua were besieged by four cultivators.Ling Aotian was overwhelmed and was in danger.Then Lihua easily saved him.\u201cBut the way she looks now \u2026. It\u2019s not an easy task at all!\u201dJiang Mu was getting worried again.In the original plot, Lihua was unharmed.But now she was limping, and that white dress was stained red with blood.It looked like the injuries are serious.\u201cForget it, as long as it turns out to be about right anyway.\u201dJiang Mu just watched silently and secretly.After Lihua saved Ling Aotian, he would find an opportunity to stuff the Black Water Seat to Ling Aotian himself.\u201cXiaohua slash!\u201dOnce Lihua ran near the three, she raised her sword and slashed down viciously at one of them.Slash!\u201cGah!\u201dDumbfounded, the man was slashed and fell to the ground with a miserable sound on the spot.Without losing her momentum, Lihua continued to slash at the remaining two.\u201cXiaohua slash!\u201dCLANG!!!One man crossed his sword to block.The other clenched his fist and quickly used his martial art.\u201cHeaven and Earth Breaking Fist!\u201dThe fist gathered full of spiritual energy punched out violently, creating an Aerial Fist.The air fist struck Lihua\u2019s abdomen perfectly.\u201c\u2026\u2026.Arghh!!!\u201dLihua was hit on the spot with a \u2018careless\u2019 blow and spat out blood as her entire body flew backwards.She cried out in the air, shouting.\u201cSister Dehua! Sister will never\u2026 be able to see you again! Sister is sorry \u2026. i will leave \u2026. first!\u201dFinally falling to the ground with a thud, she vomited out a large amount of blood, staining her white dress red.It was a tragic movement.The two men, meanwhile, were smiling lewdly and slowly approached the civet flower.It looked as if they were intent on committing mischief.\u201cMiss Xiaohua!!! Noooo!!!\u201dLing Aotian cried out tearing his heart out, his eyes already red.He asked himself, \u201cMiss Xiaohua doesn\u2019t know him at all, yet she has repeatedly saved him from danger.\u201dWhat did she want?It was because she liked him!And now, in order to save him, Miss Xiaohua had been beaten to death!And he, Ling Aotian, could do nothing about it!\u201cAh!!! Why is my master not by my side! I hate it!!!\u201dLing Aotian\u2019s face was fierce as he roared aloud.If Master Black water Fury was by his side, how can this happen?!He was beginning to blame Black Water Fury.Since she had brought him into the ranks of cultivation, said she would guide him, and promised to help him achieve his revenge.Then she shouldn\u2019t have left him alone!Now it was good.She had left for so long without returning, causing him to fail to save his beloved Xiaohua\u2026\u201cNo! I still have\u2026 My ultimate weapon!\u201dLing Aotian\u2019s heart rejoiced.He had finally remembered, the prismatic crystal block of his heart!\u201cIt\u2019s come to this, I can only risk being hunted by the world \u2026.\u201dHe stood up with difficulty.His cloudy gaze stared deadly at the two cultivators in front of him.\u201cBastards!!! I must kill you all!!!\u201dLing Aotian touched the location of his heart and secretly transferred his spiritual energy.This was seen by Jiang Mu who was hiding behind the hayloft.Very anxious.\u201cIs Ling Aotian going to reveal his ultimate power in advance?\u201d\u201cLihua, at a critical moment, she fell!\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s a ninth level of the Qi Sea realm and has so many fox clan secret techniques, how could she possibly be seriously injured!\u201d\u201cNumb, numb, numb \u2026. What the heck!\u201d\u201cLihua has long been crooked, and now she is badly injured, which makes sense!\u201d\u201cDamn, in the end, I still have to save them.\u201dJiang Mu instantly had no choice but to move and go save Lihua.And so he rushed out.\u201cHey you F*cker$! Look here!\u201dJiang Mu sweared in cute voice.\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\uff1fEveryone froze and all looked at the sound and they saw it.A young girl in a yellow dress, rushing out from behind the hayloft.Ling Aotian was surprised: it was Dahua\u2026 Miss Dahua girl? She\u2019s also came to save me? She likes me as much as Miss Xiaohua?The two men were surprised: There\u2019s actually another little girl? How cute! Tonight, we\u2019ll have a good time!Surprise for Lihua: The fish has taken the bait! Hehehe!Jiang Mu didn\u2019t know what everyone was thinking.As he ran to where Lihua was lying.While raising both arms, each extending an index finger, and pointing them at the two.Casting an immortal technique.\u201cFinger Thunder!\u201dCLAP\u2013!CLAP\u2013!Purple arcs of electricity twisted out from the two index fingers, flashing out with an ear-piercing sound.\u201cShoot!\u201dJiang Mu shouted.Two purple lightning bolts shot out from his index fingers and shot towards those two men.Everywhere the thunderbolts passed, they burned into a vacuum!\u201cThis is?!\u201dThey paled.But it was too late for them to avoid it, and they were shot through the abdomen on the spot.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cUgh!\u201dBoth of them spat out a mouthful of blood at the same time.And then they fell down.They eventually passed out.\u201cThis technique of the Miss Dahua \u2026. So strong! Even I can hardly handle it!\u201dLing Aotian was all shocked as he watched the yellow-skirted girl run towards Lihua\u2019s side.Then, the shock on his face.It then instantly turned into a smile.\u201cThe stronger the girl is, then it means that the stronger I, Ling Aotian, am!\u201dThinking like that, he couldn\u2019t help but grin.A wicked smile was directed at Miss Dahua.Clearly, He had already regarded Miss Dahua as his woman.\u201cSister?! You\u2026 You\u2019re back! Wooooooooo!\u201dAs soon as she saw Jiang Mu come to her side, Lihua was ecstatic and let loose fake a cry of pain.She even suddenly leapt up like a cat.Hugging Jiang Mu fiercely.\u201cSister I thought I\u2019d never see you again! Wooooooooo! Sister misses you so much wooooooooooooooooooo!!!\u201dIt caused Jiang Mu to shiver and almost change back to his original form.\u201cYou\u2019re not dead, are you?\u201dConcerned and comforted, Jiang Mu pushed her back down to the ground and checked her body.\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong! My stomach \u2026. I was hit by that aerial punch and my dantian seems to \u2026. crushed! Wooooooooo!!!\u201dLihua cried looking, very sad and scared.Finally so scared that both eyes rolled over and just \u2018passed out\u2019 straight away.Crap? A crushed dantian?Jiang Mu was stunned.He thought at first that Lihua was faking but just now.He had indeed seen that Lihua taking an hit hard in the abdomen by that fierce air punch.\u201cI can\u2019t leave this like .\u201dJiang Mu hurriedly pressed his palm against Lihua\u2019s abdomen.Then he injected spiritual energy.After a careful inspection.He found, Lihua\u2019s ocean-like dantian world had few cracks.\u201cCrap, she\u2019s not lying!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You. You\u2019re back! Thank you for saving me!\u201dBefore Jiang Mu even approached, Ling Aotian became excited.So excited that his entire body, quickly, greeted Jiang Mu.The pace was still very lively.Damn, was this the main character\u2019s aura?Seeing a beautiful woman makes everything heal?Bah, what kind of hot chicken novel.Jiang Mu spat out breathlessly.He said directly to Ling Aotian.\u201cYour Master is back.\u201d\u201cMaster?!\u201dLing Aotian froze in place and immediately a look of joy filled his face.\u201cYou mean my Master?! Where is she?!\u201dLing Aotian looked to the east and west, his eyes wide open.Desperately searching for the shadow of his master.Jiang Mu looked back at Lihua and found her still lying down, so he turned his head to Ling Aotian and said.\u201cIt\u2019s over there, follow me.\u201d So leading him, he walked to the back of the hayloft.\u201cThis is. Master!!!\u201dAs soon as Ling Aotian saw the black-robed \u2018little girl\u2019 lying on the ground, disheveled.He was so excited that he was about to go up and hug it.But because on a regular basis, the Master\u2019s majesty and ruthlessness were deeply rooted.So much so that he immediately stopped, not daring to go forward another step.Seeing this, Jiang Mu secretly nodded his head.It was good that the male protagonist did not have any skin-to-skin contact with his master.This was very much in line with the urbane nature of that harem trash.Jiang Mu organized his wording and told Ling Aotian all that he had thought of long ago.\u201cI need to clarify something for you.\u201d\u201cThe one lying on the ground is your master.\u201d\u201cAt that time, she entered the Wuyou Mountain for a break, but was accidentally caught in a powerful spatial vortex.\u201d\u201cFortunately, she was saved from death thanks to my discovery and rescue.\u201d\u201cExcept, I found that all her memories had been messed up.\u201d\u201cShe had no recollection of the events of the last few days.\u201d\u201cDuring these few days in her coma, she often dreamt that this seat was the Black Water Seat.\u201d\u201cBlack Water Seat, this is his real name and his appearance, too, was changed a little by the coiling force of the spatial vortex.\u201d\u201cHer sex\u2026\u201dJiang Mu suddenly stopped talking.He had wanted to tell Ling Aotian about the male gender of the Black Water Seat as well.But after thinking about it, he still found it a bit hard to explain.For one thing, one couldn\u2019t say that it was because of the spatial vortex that had swept away the x-organ, right?Secondly, this is pure Harem, gender or whatever will not affect the following plot, at most, it will just make Ling Aotian weird, which will lead to changes in plot.Thirdly, and the most crucial, that is: the vast majority of the memories implanted in Black Water Seat are fragments of Black Water Fury\u2019s memories, behavioral habits, and so on.In other words. Subconsciously, Black Water Seat already thought of himself as a female.After thinking about it, Jiang Mu continued.\u201cAlthough your master doesn\u2019t remember what happened in these four days but your master is still the same as before.\u201d\u201cTomorrow, she will wake up.\u201d\u201cThen tonight, you will wait here for her to wake up.\u201dSaid that and turned to leave, intending to go and deal with Lihua.\u201cMiss Dahua, wait!\u201dLing Aotian hurriedly called out to Dahua and asked.\u201cMiss Dahua, who exactly are you ?\u201d\u201cWhat is your cultivation level?\u201d\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d\u201cAnd why did you approach me?\u201dHe could already tell that Dahua was not an ordinary person.After all, the one who could save his Demon God realm master from the spatial vortex.It was at least the Void Realm!Maybe even Martial God realm!If she could become my Ling Aotian\u2019s woman .Thinking about it, Ling Aotian\u2019s face was full of red.His body trembled with excitement.And although Jiang Mu, who had his back turned, did not look back.But he could also guess that Ling Aotian\u2019s \u2018see one, love one\u2019 male protagonist attribute had kicked in.But no matter how much more it flared up.It would have no effect on Jiang Mu.It was because he would be leaving tonight and heading back to the Wuyou Sect.After all, Blackwater Seat had already returned and there was no longer a need for him, Jiang Mu, to desperately restore the outcome of the plot.So indifferently he replied.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know everything about me and just remember one thing.\u201d\u201cYour Master, is still your Master.\u201dHaving said that, he raised his feet and left.As he watched Dahua leave, Ling Aotian narrowed his eyes.At the same time, he secretly swore in his heart.\u201cMiss Dahua, I know that you are very powerful, and you must not think of the current me anything!\u201d\u201cBut one day, I, Ling Aotian\u201d\u201cI will definitely break through to the Martial God realm! Climb to the top of the world and then\u2026\u201d\u201cMarry you!!!\u201dThought as he smiled wickedly at the delicate back of the Dahua.Vomit!For some reason, Jiang Mu suddenly felt a bit nauseous and sick in his stomach.So much so that dry heaving occurred.\u201cCould it be that I haven\u2019t eaten today and my stomach is revolting?\u201dAfter soothing his stomach, Jiang Mu had come to the side of Lihua.Looking at the pale Lihua with a skirt full of blood.Jiang Mu instantly had a headache.\u201cDamn it, Ling Aotian\u2019s master problem is solved and now there\u2019s Lihua\u2019s broken dantian problem.\u201d\u201cDog system, it\u2019s clearly playing with Laozi.\u201dJiang Mu had no choice but to squat down and give Lihua a princess hug.Then he walked out of this dilapidated village.He planned to find a safe place.To nourish Lihua\u2019s dantian overnight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
